            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A Diſpute very learnedly handled by two
Ladies, in which the Reader may take
what Part he pleaſes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was too much
in Love to paſs the Night with
any great Degree of Tranquillity,
under the Apprehenſions he felt;
it being the Nature of that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to magnify the moſt inconſiderable
Trifles into Things of the greateſt Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
when they concern the beloved Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
did not fail to torment himſelf with
a thouſand different Fears, which the myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0005700702:4"/>
Behaviour of his Father, and the more
myſterious Words of his Miſtreſs, gave Riſe to.
Among many various Conjectures, all equally
unreaſonable, he fixed upon one, no way ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to Sir <hi>Charles;</hi> for, ſuppoſing that
the Folly of <hi>Arabella</hi> had really diſguſted him,
and made him deſirous of breaking off the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
Match between them; he was, as he
thought, taking Meaſures to bring this about,
knowing, that if Lady <hi>Bella</hi> refuſed to fulfil
her Father's Deſire in this Particular, a very
conſiderable Eſtate would deſcend to him.</p>
               <p>Upon any other Occaſion, Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>
would not have ſuſpected his Father of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
an Action; but Lovers think every
thing poſſible, which they fear; and being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed
with this Opinion, he reſolved the
next Morning to ſound his Father's Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by intreating him to endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon Lady <hi>Bella</hi> to marry him before her
Year of Mourning for the marquis was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
               <p>Attending him, therefore, at Breakfaſt, in
his own Chamber, he made his deſigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
not without heedfully obſerving his
Countenance at the ſame time; and trembling,
leſt he ſhould make him an Anſwer, that
might confirm his uneaſy Suſpicion.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> however, agreeably ſurpriſed
him, by promiſing to comply with his Deſire
that Day; for, added he, tho' my Niece has
ſome odd ways, yet, upon the Whole, ſhe is a
very accompliſhed Woman; and when you
are her Huſband, you may probably find the
Means of curing her of thoſe little Follies,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0005700702:5"/>
which at preſent are conſpicuous enough; but
being occaſioned by a Country Education, and
a perfect Ignorance of the World, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
which then you will not ſcruple to
give her, and which, from a Huſband, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Offence to her Delicacy, ſhe may
receive, may reform her Conduct; and make
her Behaviour as complete, as, it muſt be
confeſſed, both her Perſon and Mind now
are.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> having acquieſced in the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of this Remark, as ſoon as Breakfaſt was
over, went to viſit the two Ladies, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
drank their Chocolate together.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> being then in Lady <hi>Bella</hi>'s
Apartment, he was immediately admitted,
where he found them engaged in a high Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;
and, much againſt his Will, was obliged
to be Arbitrator in the Affair, they having, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Entrance, both appealed to him.</p>
               <p>But, in order to place this momentous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
in a true Light, 'tis neceſſary to go back a
little, and acquaint the Reader with what had
paſſed in the Apartment; and alſo, following
the Cuſtom of the Romance and Novel-Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in the Heart, of our Heroine.</p>
               <p>No ſooner were her fair Eyes open in the
Morning, than the unfortunate Sir <hi>George</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
himſelf to her Imagination, her Thoughts
to uſe <hi>Scudery</hi>'s Phraſe, were at a cruel War with
each other: She wiſhed to prevent the Death
of this obſequious Lover; but ſhe could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to preſerve his Life, by giving him that
Hope he required; and without which, ſhe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0005700702:6"/>
feared, it would be impoſſible for him to
live.</p>
               <p>After pondering a few Hours upon the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of his Caſe, and what a juſt Regard to
her own Honour required of her, Decorum
prevailed ſo much over Compaſſion, that ſhe
reſolved to abandon the miſerable Sir <hi>George</hi>
to all the Rigour of his Deſtiny; when, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
for the diſconſolate Lover, the Hiſtory of
the fair <hi>Amalazotha</hi> coming into her Mind,
ſhe remembred, that this haughty Princeſs,
having refuſed to marry the Perſon, her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
recommended to her, becauſe he had not
a Crown upon his Head; nevertheleſs, when he
was dying for Love of her, condeſcended to
viſit him, and even to give him a little Hope,
in order to preſerve his Life: See conceived it
could be no Blemiſh to her Character, if ſhe
followed the Example of this moſt glorious
Princeſs; and ſuffered herſelf to relax a little in
her Severity, to prevent the Effects of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's
Deſpair.</p>
               <p>Fear not, <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſaid ſhe to herſelf; fear
not to obey the Dictates of thy Compaſſion,
ſince the glorious <hi>Amalazontha</hi> juſtifies, by her
Example, the Means thou wilt uſe to preſerve
a noble Life, which depends upon a few Words
thou ſhalt utter.</p>
               <p>When ſhe had taken this Reſolution, ſhe
rung her Bell for her Women; and as ſoon as
ſhe was dreſſed, ſhe diſmiſſed them all but <hi>Lucy,</hi>
whom ſhe ordered to bring her Paper and Pens,
telling her, ſhe would write an Anſwer to Sir
<hi>George</hi>'s Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy</hi> obeyed with great Joy; but by that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0005700702:7"/>
time ſhe had brought her Lady all the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
for Writing, her Mind was changed; ſhe
having reflected, that <hi>Amalazontha,</hi> whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
in order to avoid the Cenſure of future
Ages, ſhe was reſolved exactly to follow, did
not write to <hi>Ambiome<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> but paid him a Viſit,
ſhe reſolved to do the like; and therefore bid
<hi>Lucy</hi> take them away again, telling her: She
had thought better of it, and would not write
to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> extremely concerned at this Reſolution,
obeyed her very ſlowly, and with greeat ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Regret.</p>
               <p>I perceive, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> you are afraid, I
ſhall abandon the unfortunate Man you ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for, to the Violence of his Deſpair; but
tho' I do not intend to write to him, yet I'll
make uſe of a Method, perhaps as effectual;
for, to ſpeak truly, I mean to make him a Viſit;
for by this time his Fever is, I ſuppoſe, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
enough to make him keep his Bed.</p>
               <p>And will you be ſo good, Madam, ſaid
<hi>Lucy,</hi> to go and ſee the poor Gentleman? I
warrant you, he will be ready to die for Joy,
when he ſees you.</p>
               <p>There muſt be proper Precautions uſed, ſaid
<hi>Arabella,</hi> to prevent thoſe Conſequences, which
the ſudden and unexpected Sight of me may
produce. Thoſe about him, I ſuppoſe, will have
Diſcretion enough for that: Therefore give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for the Coach to be made ready, and tell
my Women, they muſt attend me; and be
ſure you give them Directions, when I enter
Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Chamber, to ſtay at a convenient
Diſtance, in order to leave me an Opportunity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0005700702:8"/>
of ſpeaking to him, without being heard: As
for you, you may approach the Bed-ſide with
me; ſince, being my Confident, you may hear
all we have to ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> having thus ſettled the Ceremonial
of her Viſit, according to the Rules preſcribed
by Romances, ſat down to her Tea-table,
having ſent to know, if Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> was up,
and received for Anſwer, that ſhe would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
her at Breakfaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who had at firſt determined to
ſay nothing of this Affair to her Couſin, could
not reſiſt the Deſire ſhe had of talking upon a
Subject ſo intereſting; and, telling her with a
Smile, that ſhe was about to make a very
charitable Viſit that Morning, aſked her, if
ſhe was diſpoſed to bear her Company in it.</p>
               <p>I know you Country Ladies, ſaid Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> are very fond of viſiting your ſick
Neighbours: For my Part, I do not love ſuch
a grave kind of Amuſement; yet, for the ſake
of the Airing, I ſhall be very willing to attend
you.</p>
               <p>I think, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> with a more ſerious
Air than before, it behoves every generous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to compaſſionate the Misfortunes of their
Acquaintance and Friends, and to relieve them
as far as lies in their Power; but thoſe Miſeries
we ourſelves occaſion to others, demand, in a
more particular Manner, our Pity; and, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with Honour, our Relief.</p>
               <p>And pray, returned Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who is
it you have done any Miſchief to, which you
are to repair by this charitable Viſit, as you
call it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0005700702:9"/>
The Miſchief I have done, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi>
bluſhing, and caſting down her Eyes, was not
voluntary, I aſſure you: Yet I will not ſcruple
to repair it, if I can; tho', ſince my Power is
confined by certain unavoidable Laws, my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
may not haply have all the Succeſs I
could wiſh.</p>
               <p>Well, but, dear Couſin, interrupted Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> tell me in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> what this
Miſchief is, which you have done; and to what
Purpoſe you are going out this Morning?</p>
               <p>I am going to pay a Viſit to Sir <hi>George Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
replied <hi>Arabella;</hi> and I intreat you, fair
Couſin, to pardon me for robbing you of ſo
accompliſhed a Lover. I really always thought
he was in Love with you, till I was undeceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſome Words he ſpoke Yeſterday; and
a Letter I received from him laſt Night, in
which he has been bold enough to declare his
Paſſion to me, and, through the Apprehenſion
of my Anger, is this Moment dying with
Grief; and 'tis to reconcile him to Life, that
I have prevailed upon myſelf to make him a
Viſit; in which charitable Deſign, as I ſaid
before, I ſhould be glad of your Company.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who believed not a Word
Lady <hi>Bella</hi> had ſaid, burſt out a laughing, at a
Speech, that appeared to her ſo extremely falſe
and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>I ſee, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> you are of a Humour
to divert yourſelf with the Miſeries of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
Lover; and in this Particular, you
greatly reſemble the fair and witty <hi>Doraliſa,</hi>
who always jeſted at ſuch Maladies as are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by Love: However, this Inſenſibility
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0005700702:10"/>
does not become you ſo well as her, ſince
all her Conduct was conformable to it, no Marr
in the World being bold enough to talk to her
of Love; but you, Couſin, are ready, even by
your own Confeſſion, to liſten to ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
from any body; and therefore this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
in you, may be with more Juſtice
termed Levity, than Indifference.</p>
               <p>I perceive, Couſin, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I
have always the worſt of thoſe Compariſons
you are pleaſed to make between me and other
People; but, I aſſure you, as free and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
as you think me, I ſhould very much
ſcruple to viſit a Man, upon any Occaſion
whatever.</p>
               <p>I am quite aſtoniſhed, Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<hi>Arabella,</hi> to hear you aſſume a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of ſo much Severity; you, who have
granted Favours of a Kind in a very great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
criminal.</p>
               <p>Favours! interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Favours! Pray explain yourſelf, Madam.</p>
               <p>Yes, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> I repeat it again;
criminal Favours, ſuch as allowing Perſons to
talk to you of Love; not forbidding them to
write to you; giving them Opportunities of
being alone with you for ſeveral Moments to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and ſeveral other Civilities of the like
Nature, which no Man can poſſibly merit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
many Years Services, Fidelity, and Pains:
All theſe are criminal Favours, and highly blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in a Lady, who has any Regard for her
Reputation.</p>
               <p>All theſe, replied Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Compariſon of making them Viſits; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0005700702:11"/>
no Woman, who has any Reputation at all,
will be guilty of taking ſuch Liberties.</p>
               <p>What! Miſs, replied, <hi>Arabella,</hi> will you
dare, by this Inſinuation, to caſt any Cenſures
upon the Virtue of the divine <hi>Mandana,</hi> the
haughty <hi>Amalazontha,</hi> the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> the cold
and rigid <hi>Pariſatis,</hi> and many other illuſtrious
Ladies, who did not ſcruple to viſit their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
when confined to their Beds, either by
the Wounds they received in Battle, or the
more cruel and dangerous ones they ſuffered
from their Eyes? Theſe chaſte Ladies, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
granted a Kiſs of their Hand to a Lover,
till he was upon the Point of being their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
would nevertheleſs moſt charitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
to approach their Bed-ſide, and ſpeak
ſome compaſſionate Words to them, in order
to promote their Cure, and make them ſubmit
to live; nay, theſe divine Beauties would not
refuſe to grant the ſame Favour to Perſons
whom they did not love, to prevent the fatal
Conſequences of their Deſpair.</p>
               <p>Lord, Madam! interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
I wonder you can talk ſo blaſphemouſly, to call
a Parcel of confident Creatures divine, and
ſuch terrible Words.</p>
               <p>Do you know, Miſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> with a
ſtern Look, that 'tis of the greateſt Princeſſes
that ever were, whom you ſpeak in this irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
Manner? Is it poſſible, that you can be
ignorant of the ſublime Quality of <hi>Mandana,</hi>
who was the Heireſs of Two powerful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms?
Are you not ſenſible, that <hi>Amalazontha</hi>
was Queen of <hi>Turringia?</hi> And will you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0005700702:12"/>
to deny the glorious Extraction of <hi>Statira</hi>
and <hi>Pariſatis,</hi> Princeſſes of <hi>Perſia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not trouble myſelf to deny any thing
about them, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville;</hi> for
I never heard of them before; and really I do
not chooſe to be always talking of Queens and
Princeſſes, as if I thought none but ſuch great
People were worthy my Notice: It looks ſo
affected, I ſhuld imagine every one laughed
at me, that heard me.</p>
               <p>Since you are ſo very ſcrupulous, returned
<hi>Arabella,</hi> that you dare not imitate the Sublimeſt
among Mortals, I can furniſh you with many
Examples, from the Conduct of Perſons, whoſe
Quality was not much ſuperior to yours, which
may reconcile you to an Action, you at preſent,
with ſo little Reaſon, condemn: And, to name
but One among ſome Thouſands, the fair <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
the moſt rigid and auſtere Beauty in all <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
paid ſeveral Viſits to the paſſionate <hi>Ligda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi>
when his Melancholy, at the ill Succeſs of
his Paſſion, threw him into a Fever, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
him to his Bed.</p>
               <p>And pray, Madam, who was that <hi>Cleonice?</hi>
ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville;</hi> and where did ſhe live?</p>
               <p>In <hi>Sardis,</hi> I tell you, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> in the
Kingdom of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! then it is not in our Kingdom, ſaid
Miſs <hi>Glanville:</hi> What ſignifies what Foreigners
do? I ſhall never form my Conduct, upon the
Example of Outlandiſh People; what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enough in their Countries, would be very
particular here; and you can never perſuade me,
that it is ſeemly for Ladies to pay Viſits to
Men in their Beds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0005700702:13"/>
A Lady, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> extremely angry at
her Couſin's Obſtinacy, who will ſuffer Men
to preſs her Hand, write to her, and talk to
her of Love, ought to be aſhamed of ſuch an
affected Niceneſs, as that you pretend to.</p>
               <p>I inſiſt upon it, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
that all thoſe innocent Liberties you rail
at, may be taken by any Woman, without
giving the World room to cenſure her: but,
without being very bold and impudent, ſhe
cannot go to ſee Men in their Beds; a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that only becomes a Siſter, or near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>So then, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> reddening with
Vexation, you will perſiſt in affirming the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Mandana</hi> was impudent?</p>
               <p>If ſhe paid ſuch indiſcreet Viſits as thoſe, ſhe
was, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh Heavens! cried <hi>Arabella,</hi> have I lived
to hear the moſt illuſtrious Princeſs, that ever
was in the World, ſo ſhamefully reflected
on?</p>
               <p>Bleſs me, Madam! ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> what
Reaſon have you to defend the Character of
this Princeſs ſo much? She will hardly thank
you for your Pains, I fanſy.</p>
               <p>Were you acquainted with the Character of
that moſt generous Princeſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> you
would be convinced, that ſhe was ſenſible of
the ſmalleſt Benefits; but it is not with a View
of acquiring her Favour, that I defend her
againſt your inhuman Aſperſions, ſince it is
more than Two thouſand Years ſince ſhe died;
yet common Juſtice obliges me to vindicate a
Perſon ſo illuſtrious for her Birth and Virtue;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0005700702:14"/>
and were you not my Couſin, I ſhould expreſs
my Reſentment in another Manner, for the
Injury you do her.</p>
               <p>Truly, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I am not much
obliged to you Madam, for not downright
quarrelling with me for one that has been in
her Grave Two thouſand Years: However,
nothing ſhall make me change my Opinion,
and I am ſure moſt People will be of my Side
of the Argument.</p>
               <p>That Moment Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> ſending for
Permiſſion to wait upon <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſhe ordered
him to be admitted, telling Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſhe
would acquaint her Brother with the Diſpute:
To which ſhe conſented.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Which inculcates by a very good Example,
that a Perſon ought not to be too haſty in

               </argument>
               <p>YOU are come very opportunely, Sir, ſaid.
<hi>Arabella,</hi> when he entered the Room, to
be Judge of a great Controverſy between Miſs
<hi>Glanville</hi> and myſelf. I beſeech you therefore,
let us have your Opinion upon the Matter.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> maintains, that it is leſs cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
in a Lady to hear Perſons talk to her of
Love, allow them to kiſs her Hand, and permit
them to write to her, than to make a charitable
Viſit to a Man who is confined to his Bed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0005700702:15"/>
through the Violence of his Paſſion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair;
the Intent of this Viſit being only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Death of an unfortunate Lover, and,
if neceſſary, to lay her Commands upon him
to live.</p>
               <p>And this latter is your Opinion, is it not
Madam? ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> and in this I
am juſtified by all the Heroines of Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Then you muſt be in the Right, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> both becauſe your own
Judgment tells you ſo, and alſo the Example
of theſe Heroines you mention.</p>
               <p>Well, Madam, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
haſtily, ſince my Brother has given Sentence on
your Side, I hope you will not delay your Viſit
to Sir <hi>George</hi> any longer.</p>
               <p>How! ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſurpriſed, is Lady
<hi>Bella</hi> going to viſit Sir <hi>George?</hi> Pray, Madam,
may I preſume to-inquire the Reaſon for your
doing him this extraordinary Favour?</p>
               <p>You are not very wiſe, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> looking
gravely upon Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> to diſcover a
Thing, which may haply create a Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your Brother, and the unfortunate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
you ſpeak of: Yet ſince this Indiſcretion
cannot be recalled, we muſt endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Conſequences of it.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Madam, interrupted Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
extremely impatient to know the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theſe Hints, you have nothing to fear
from me: Therefore you need not think your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
under any Neceſſity of concealing this Affair
from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0005700702:16"/>
You are not, haply, ſo moderate as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> (who would not have been
diſpleaſed to have ſeen him in all the jealous
Tranſports of an enraged <hi>Orontes);</hi> but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
enſues, I can no longer keep from your
Knowledge, a Truth your Siſter has begun to
diſcover; but, in telling you what you deſire to
know, I expect you will ſuppreſs all Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Revenge, and truſt the Care of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to my Generoſity.</p>
               <p>You are to know then, that in the Perſon of
your Friend Sir <hi>George,</hi> you have a Rival,
haply the more to be feared, as his Paſſion is
no leſs reſpectful than violent: I poſſibly tell
you more than I ought, purſued ſhe, bluſhing,
and caſting down her Eyes, when I confeſs,
that for certain Conſiderations, wherein perhaps
you are concerned, I have received the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation
of this Paſſion with Diſdain enough;
and I aſſure myſelf, that you are too generous
to deſire any Revenge upon a miſerable Rival,
of whom Death is going to free you.</p>
               <p>Then, taking Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Letter out of her
Cabinet, ſhe preſented it to Mr. <hi>Glanville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Read this, added ſhe; but read it without
ſuffering yourſelf to be tranſported with any
violent Motions of Anger: And as in Fight, I
am perſuaded you would not oppreſs a fallen
and vanquiſhed Foe; ſo in Love, I may hope,
an unfortunate Rival will merit your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
               <p>Never doubt it, Madam, replied Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
receiving the Letter, which Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
with a beating Heart, earneſtly deſired to hear
read. Her Brother, after aſking Permiſſion of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0005700702:17"/>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> prepared to gratify her Curioſity; but
he no ſooner read the firſt Sentence, than,
notwithſtanding all his Endeavours, a Smile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in his Face; and Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> leſs able,
and indeed leſs concerned to reſtrain her Mirth
at the uncommon Stile, burſt out a laughing,
with ſo much Violence, as obliged her Brother
to ſtop, and counterfeit a terrible Fit of Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in order to avoid giving <hi>Arabella</hi> the like
Offence.</p>
               <p>The Aſtoniſhment of this Lady, at the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
and unexpected Effect her Lover's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
produced on Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> kept her in a
profound Silence, her Eyes wandering from the
Siſter to the Brother; who, continuing his
Cough, was not able, for ſome Moments, to
go on with his Reading.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> during this Interval, having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
herſelf a little, aſked Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> if
ſhe found any thing in a Lover's Deſpair,
capable of diverting her ſo much, as ſhe ſeemed
to be with that of the unfortunate Sir <hi>George?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Siſter, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
preventing her Reply, knows ſo many of Sir
<hi>George</hi>'s Infidelities, that ſhe cannot perſuade
herſelf he is really in ſuch a dangerous Way
as he inſinuates: Therefore you ought not to be
ſurpriſed, if ſhe is rather diſpoſed to laugh at
this Epiſtle, than to be moved with any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for the Writer, who, though he is my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
I muſt ſay, appears to be in a deplorable
Condition.</p>
               <p>Pray, Sir, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> a little compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by thoſe Words, finiſh the Letter: Your
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0005700702:18"/>
Siſter may poſſibly find more Cauſe for Pity
than Contempt, in the latter Part of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> giving a Look to his Siſter,
ſufficient to make her comprehend, that he
would have her reſtrain her Mirth for the future,
proceeded in his Reading; but every Line in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
his ſtrong Inclination to laugh, when
he came to the pathetic Wiſh, that her fair
Eyes might ſhed ſome Tears upon his Tomb,
no longer able to keep his aſſumed Gravity,
he threw down the Letter in a counterfeited
Rage.</p>
               <p>Curſe the ſtupid Fellow! cried he, is he mad,
to call the fineſt Black Eyes in the Univerſe,
fair. Ah! Couſin, ſaid he to <hi>Arabella,</hi> to muſt
be little acquainted with the Influence of your
Eyes, ſince he can ſo egregiouſly miſtake their
Colour.</p>
               <p>And it is very plain, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> that
you are little acquainted with the ſublime Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
in which he writes, ſince you find Fault
with an Epithet, which marks the Beauty, not
the Colour, of thoſe Eyes he praiſes; for, in
fine, Fair is indifferently applied, as well to
Black and Brown Eyes, as to Light and Blue
ones, when they are either really lovely in
themſelves, or by the Lover's Imagination
created ſo: And therefore, ſince Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
Prepoſſeſſion has made him ſee Charms in my
Eyes, which queſtionleſs are not there; by
calling them fair, he has very happily expreſſed
himſelf, ſince therein he has the Sanction of
thoſe great Hiſtorians, who wrote the Hiſtories
of Lovers he ſeems to imitate, as well in his
Actions as Stile.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0005700702:19"/>
I find my Rival is very happy in your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville;</hi> and I am
apt to believe, I ſhall have more Reaſon to
envy than pity his Situation.</p>
               <p>If you keep within the Bounds I preſcribe
you, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> you ſhall have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to envy his Situation; but, conſidering the
Condition to which his Deſpair has by this Time
certainly reduced him, Humanity requires that
we ſhould take ſome Care of him; and, to
ſhew you how great my Opinion of your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
is, I will even intreat you to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
me in the Viſit I am going to make him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> being determined, if poſſible,
to prevent her expoſing herſelf, affected to be
extremely moved at this Requeſt; and, riſing
from his Chair in great ſeeming Agitation, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
the Room for ſome Moments, without
ſpeaking a Word: Then ſuddenly ſtopping;</p>
               <p>And can you, Madam, ſaid he, looking
upon <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſuppoſe, that I will conſent to
your viſiting my Rival; and that I will be mean
enough to attend you myſelf to his Houſe? Do
you think, that <hi>Orontes</hi> you have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
me with, would act in ſuch a
Manner?</p>
               <p>I don't know how <hi>Orontes</hi> would have acted
in this Caſe, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> becauſe it never
happened that ſuch a Proof of his Submiſſion
was ever deſired of him; but, conſidering that
he was of a very fiery and jealous Diſpoſition,
it is probable he might act as you do.</p>
               <p>I always underſtood, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
that <hi>Orontes</hi> was a Favourite of yours,
but it ſeems I was miſtaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0005700702:20"/>
You will be very unjuſt, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> to
draw any unfavourable Concluſion from what
I have ſaid, to the Prejudice of that valiant
Prince, for whom I confeſs I have a great Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem;
and truly whoever reflects upon the
great Actions he did in the Wars between the
<hi>Amazons</hi> and the fierce <hi>Naobarzanes</hi> King of
the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> muſt needs conceive a very high
Idea of his Virtue; but if I cannot bring the
Example of <hi>Orontes</hi> to influence you in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Caſe, I can mention thoſe of other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
no leſs illuſtrious for their Birth and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
than him. Did not the brave <hi>Memnon,</hi>
when his Rival <hi>Oxyatres</hi> was ſick, intreat the
beautiful <hi>Barſina</hi> to favour him with a Viſit?
And the complaiſant Huſband of the divine <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſatis</hi>
was not contented with barely deſiring
her to viſit <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> who was dying with
Deſpair at her Marriage, but would many
times bring her himſelf to the Bed-ſide of this
unfortunate Lover, and, leaving her there, give
him an Opportunity of telling her what he
ſuffered for her ſake.</p>
               <p>I am afraid, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> I
ſhall never be capable of imitating either the
brave <hi>Memnon,</hi> nor the complaiſant <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi>
in this Caſe, and the Humour of <hi>Orontes</hi> ſeems
to me the moſt commendable.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> the Humour of
<hi>Orontes</hi> coſt him an infinite Number of Pains;
and it may happen, you will as near reſemble
him in his Fortune as you do in his Diſpoſition:
But pray let us end this Diſpute at preſent.
If you are not generous enough to viſit an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Rival, you ſhall not put a Stop to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0005700702:21"/>
the Charity of my Intentions; and ſince Miſs
<hi>Glanville</hi> is all of a ſudden become ſo ſevere,
that ſhe will not accompany me in this Viſit,
I ſhall be contented with the Attendance of
my Women.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe roſe from her Seat, calling
<hi>Lucy,</hi> and ordered her to bid her Companions
attend.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſeeing her thus determined,
was almoſt mad with Vexation.</p>
               <p>Upon my Soul, Madam, ſaid he, feizing
her Hand, you muſt not go.</p>
               <p>How, Sir! ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſternly.</p>
               <p>Not without ſeeing me die firſt, reſumed he,
in a languiſhing Tone.</p>
               <p>You muſt not die, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> a little
ſoftened, nor muſt you pretend to hinder me
from going.</p>
               <p>Nay, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> one of theſe
two Things will certainly happen: Either you
muſt reſolve not to viſit Sir <hi>George,</hi> or elſe be
contented to ſee me die at your Feet.</p>
               <p>Was ever any Lady in ſo cruel a Dilemma?
ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> throwing herſelf into the Chair
in a languiſhing Poſture: What can I do to
prevent the Fate of two Perſons, one of whom
I infinitely pity, and the other, obſtinate as he
is, I cannot hate? Shall I reſolve to let the
miſerable <hi>Bellmour</hi> die, rather than grant him a
Favour the moſt rigid Virtue would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
him? or ſhall I, by oppoſing the impetuous
Humour of a Lover, to whom I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
obliged, make myſelf the Author of his
Death? Fatal Neceſſity! which obliges me
either to be cruel or unjuſt; and, with a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

Indeed, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I could
ſwear for him that he will.</p>
               <p>Well, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> I will content myſelf
with ſending him my Commands in Writing;
but it is to be feared they will not have ſo much
Efficacy upon his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> extremely pleaſed that ſhe
had laid aſide her Deſign of viſiting Sir <hi>George,</hi>
did not oppoſe her writing to him, though he
was plotting how to prevent the Letter reaching
his Hands; and while ſhe went into her Cloſet
to write, he conferred with his Siſter upon the
Means he ſhould uſe, expreſſing, at the ſame
time, great Reſentment againſt Sir <hi>George,</hi>
for endeavouring to ſupplant him in his Couſin's
Affection.</p>
               <p>What then, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> do you
really imagine Sir <hi>George</hi> is in Love with Lady
<hi>Bella?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is either in Love with her Perſon or
Eſtate, replied Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> or perhaps with
both; for ſhe is handſome enough to gain a
Lover of his Merit, though ſhe had no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
and ſhe has Fortune enough to do it,
though ſhe had no Beauty.</p>
               <p>My Couſin is well enough, to be ſure, ſaid
Miſs <hi>Glanville;</hi> but I never could think her a
Beauty.</p>
               <p>If, replied Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> a moſt lovely
Complection, regular Features, a fine Stature,
an elegant Shape, and an inexpreſſible Grace
in all her Motions, can form a Beauty, Lady
<hi>Bella</hi> may pretend to that Character, without
any Diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0005700702:24"/>
Though ſhe was all that you ſay, returned
Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I am certain Sir <hi>George</hi> is not
in Love with her.</p>
               <p>I wiſh I was certain of that, replied Mr.
<hi>Glanville;</hi> for 'tis very probable you are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
               <p>You may ſee by his Letter, interrupted Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> what a Jeſt he makes of her; and
if you had heard how he talked to her the other
Day in the Garden, you would have died with
Laughing; yet my poor Couſin thought he was
very ſerious, and was ſo fooliſhly pleaſed!</p>
               <p>I aſſure you <hi>Charlotte,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
gravely, I ſhall take it very ill, if you make ſo
free with your Couſin's little Foibles; and if
Sir <hi>George</hi> preſumes to make a Jeſt of her, as
you ſay, I ſhall teach him better Manners.</p>
               <p>You are the ſtrangeſt Creature in the World!
ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville:</hi> A Minute or two ago, you
was wiſhing to be ſure he was not in Love with
her; and now you are angry, when I aſſure
you he is only in Jeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> that Moment coming out of her
Cloſet, broke off their Diſcourſe. I have
written to Sir <hi>George,</hi> ſaid ſhe, addreſſing herſelf
to Mr. <hi>Glanville;</hi> and you are at Liberty, if
you pleaſe, to read my Letter, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to ſend away immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> taking the Letter out of her
Hand, with a low Bow, began to read it to
himſelf; but <hi>Arabella,</hi> willing his Siſter ſhould
alſo be acquainted with the Contents, obliged
him, much againſt his Will, to read it aloud.
It was as follows:</p>

<hi>Arabella</hi> did not deſign to encourage the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes

Conſequence of his having ſuch a convincing
Proof of the Peculiarity of her Temper in his

Hand, as if he wanted to conſider it a little
better, he meditated on the Means to prevent
its being ever delivered; and had poſſibly fixed
upon ſome ſucceſsful Contrivance, when a

Sir <hi>George</hi> was come to wait on them, put an

and it is, haply, to execute his fatal Deſign in

Bleſs me, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> what
horrid Things come into your Head! I vow,
you terrify me out of my Wits, to hear you.</p>
               <p>There is no Occaſion for your Fears, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<hi>Arabella:</hi> Since we already ſuſpect his

Had the Princeſs of the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> known the

ſhe would have uſed ſome Precautions to
hinder him from executing them; for want of
which, ſhe ſaw the miſerable <hi>Agilmond</hi> wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
in his Blood at her Feet; and with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
accuſed herſelf of being the Cauſe of ſo
deplorable a Spectacle.</p>
               <p>The Aſtoniſhment Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> was in, to
hear her Couſin talk in this Manner, kept her
from giving her any Interruption, while ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
ſeveral other terrible Inſtances of Deſpair.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Sir <hi>George,</hi> who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to go up to Lady <hi>Bella</hi>'s Apartment,
having flattered himſelf with an Hope, that his
Letter was favourably received; and that he
ſhould be permitted to <hi>hope</hi> at leaſt; made a

accompanied by Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee in what manner <hi>Arabella</hi> received
him, went to her Apartment.</p>
               <p>As he had taken care, at his Entrance, to
accommodate his Looks to the Character he
had aſſumed of an humble deſpairing Lover,
<hi>Arabella</hi> no ſooner ſaw him, but her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
changed; and, making a Sign to Mr.
<hi>Glanville,</hi> who could not comprehend what
ſhe meant, to ſeize upon the Guard of his
Sword, ſhe haſtily ſtept forward to meet him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0005700702:28"/>
I am too well convinced, ſaid ſhe to Sir
<hi>George,</hi> that the Intent of your coming hither
To day, is to commit ſome Violence againſt
yourſelf before my Eyes: But liſten not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, to the Dictates of your Deſpair:
Live; I command you, live; and ſince you ſay,
I have the abſolute Diſpoſal of your Life, do
not deprive yourſelf of it, without the Conſent

               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> who did not imagine <hi>Arabella</hi>
would communicate his Letter to her Couſins,
and only expected ſome diſtant Hints from her
concerning it, was ſo confounded at this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
before them, that he was not able to
reply: He bluſhed, and turned pale alternately;
and, not daring to look, either upon Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
or her Brother, or to meet the Eyes of the
fair Viſionary, who, with great Impatience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
his Anſwer, he hung down his Head
in a very ſilly Poſture; and, by his Silence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<hi>Arabella</hi> in her Opinion.</p>
               <p>As he did not want for Wit and Aſſurance,
during that Interval of Silence, and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from all Parties; his Imagination ſuggeſted
to him the Means of extricating himſelf out of
the ridiculous Perplexity he was in; and as it
concerned him greatly to avoid any Quarrel,
with the Brother and Siſter, he determined to
turn the whole Matter into a Jeſt; but, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
to manage it ſo, that <hi>Arabella</hi> ſhould not
enter into his Meaning.</p>
               <p>Raiſing therefore his Eyes, and looking upon

You are not deceived, Madam, ſaid he: This

thoſe Crimes of which you accuſe him:
But ſince your ſevere Compaſſion will oblige
me to live, I obey, oh! moſt divine, but cruel
<hi>Arabella!</hi> I obey your harſh Commands; and,
by endeavouring to live, give you a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Proof of that Reſpect and Submiſſion
I ſhall always have for your Will.</p>
               <p>I expected no leſs from your Courage and
Generoſity, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> with a Look of great
Complacency; and ſince you ſo well know
how to imitate the great <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> in your
Obedience, I ſhall not be leſs acknowleging
then the fair <hi>Pariſatis;</hi> but will have for you
an Eſteem equal to that Virtue I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in you.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> having received this gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
with a moſt profound Bow, turned to
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> with a kind of chaſtened Smile
upon his Countenance.</p>
               <p>And, you, fortunate and deſerving Knight,
ſaid he, happy in the Affections of the faireſt
Perſon in the World! grudge me not this ſmall
Alleviation of my Misfortunes; and envy me
not that Eſteem, which alone is able to make
me ſuffer Life, while you poſſeſs, in the Heart
of the divine <hi>Arabella,</hi> a Felicity that might
be envied by the greateſt Monarchs in the
World.</p>
               <p>As diverting as this Scene was, Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
was extremely uneaſy: For though Sir
<hi>George</hi>'s Stratagem took, and he believed he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0005700702:30"/>
was only indulging the Gaiety of his Humour,
by carrying on this Farce; yet he could not
endure, he ſhould divert himſelf at <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
Expence. The ſolemn Speech he had made him,
did indeed force him to ſmile; but he ſoon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
a graver Look, and told Sir <hi>George,</hi> in
a low Voice, that when he had finiſhed his
Viſit, he ſhould be glad to take a Turn with
him in the Garden.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> promiſed to follow him, and Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> left the Room, and went into the
Gardens; where the Baronet, having taken a
reſpectful Leave of <hi>Arabella,</hi> and, by a ſly
Glance, convinced Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> he had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
her Couſin to her Mirth, went to join
her Brother.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw him, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to meet him with a very reſerved Air: Which
Sir <hi>George</hi> obſerving, and being reſolved to keep
up his Humour;</p>
               <p>What, inhuman, but too happy Lover, ſaid
he, what, am I to underſtand by that Cloud
upon your Brow? Is it poſſible, that thou
canſt envy me the ſmall Comfort I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and, not ſatisfied with the glorious
Advantages thou poſſeſſeſt, wilt thou ſtill deny
me that Eſteem, which the divine <hi>Arabella</hi>
has been pleaſed to beſtow upon me?</p>
               <p>Pray, Sir <hi>George,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> lay
aſide this pompous Style: I am not diſpoſed to
be merry at preſent, and have not all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
for this kind of Wit, that you ſeem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.
I deſired to ſee you here, that I might
tell you without Witneſſes, I take it extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ill, you ſhould preſume to make my Couſin
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0005700702:31"/>
the Object of your Mirth. Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> Sir,
is not a Perſon, with whom ſuch Liberties
ought to be taken; nor will I, in the double
Character of her Lover and Relation, ſuffer it
from any one whatever.</p>
               <p>Cruel Fortune! ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi> ſtepping back
a little, and lifting up his Eyes, ſhall I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be expoſed to thy Perſecutions? And
muſt I, without any apparent Cauſe, behold
an Enemy in the Perſon of my Friend; who,
though, without murmuring, I reſign to him
the adorable <hi>Arabella,</hi> is yet reſolved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with me, a Satisfaction, which does not
deprive him of any Part of that glorious For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to which he is deſtined? Since it is ſo,
unjuſt and cruel Friend, purſued he, ſtrike
this Breaſt, which carries the Image of the
divine <hi>Arabella;</hi> but think not, that I will offer
to defend myſelf, or lift my Sword, againſt a
Man beloved by her.</p>
               <p>This is all very fine, returned Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
hardly able to forbear laughing; but 'tis
impoſſible, with all your Gaiety, to hinder me
from being ſerious upon this Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Then be as ſerious as thou wilt, dear <hi>Charles,</hi>
interrupted Sir <hi>George,</hi> provided you will allow
me to be gay; and not pretend to infect me
with thy unbecoming Gravity.</p>
               <p>I have but a few Words to ſay to you, then,
Sir, replied Mr. <hi>Glanville:</hi> Either behave with
more Reſpect to my Couſin; or prepare to
give me Satisfaction, for the Inſults you offer
her.</p>
               <p>Oh! I underſtand you, Sir, ſaid Sir <hi>George;</hi>
and becauſe you have taken it into your Head
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0005700702:32"/>
to be offended at a Trifle of no Conſequence in
the World, I muſt give you a fair Chance to
run me through the Body! There is ſomething
very fooliſh, ſaith, in ſuch an extravagant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation:
But ſince Cuſtom has made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that a Man muſt venture his Soul and
Body upon theſe important Occaſions; becauſe
I will not be out of the Faſhion, you ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me whenever you think ſit; though I
ſhall fight with my Schoolfellow with a very
ill Will, I aſſure you.</p>
               <p>There is no Neceſſity for fighting, ſaid Mr.
<hi>Glanville,</hi> bluſhing at the ludicrous Light, in
which the gay Baronet had placed his Challenge:
The Conceſſion I have required, is very ſmall,
and not worth the conteſting for, on your Side.
Lady <hi>Beila</hi>'s Peculiarity, to which you contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
ſo much, can afford you, at beſt, but an
ill-natured Diverſion, while it gives me a real
Pain; and ſure, you muſt acknowlege, you
are doing me a very great Injury, when you
endeavour to confirm a Lady, who is to be my
Wife, in a Behaivour that excites your Mirth,
and makes her a fit Object for your Ridicule,
and Contempt.</p>
               <p>You do Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> a mnch greater Injury
than I do, replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> by ſuppoſing,
ſhe can ever be an Object of Ridicule and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
I think very highly of her Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and though the Bent of her Studies has
given her Mind a romantic Turn, yet the
Singularity of her Manners is far leſs diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
than the lighter Follies of moſt of her
Sex.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0005700702:33"/>
But to be abſolutely perfect, interrupted Mr.
<hi>Glanville,</hi> I muſt cure her of that Singularity;
and therefore I beg you will not perſiſt in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
a Behaviour conformable to her ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic
Ideas; but rather help me to baniſh them
from her Imagination.</p>
               <p>Well, replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> ſince you no longer
threaten, I'll do what I can to content you; but
I muſt quit my Heroics by Degrees, and ſink
with Decency into my own Character; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſhe will never endure me in her Preſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> and Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> appearing in
the Walk, broke off the Converſation. The
Baronet and Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> walked forward to
meet them; but <hi>Arabella,</hi> who did not deſire
Company, ſtruck into another Walk, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> following, propoſed to join
her; when he ſaw his Father, who had been
taking a Turn there alone, make up to <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella;</hi>
and, ſuppoſing he would take that Op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portunity

replied ſhe; and 'tis with great Regret I ſee
myſelf obliged to make uſe of Expreſſions no
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0005700702:35"/>
way conformable to the Reſpect I bear that
ſacred Character.</p>
               <p>And, pray, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſoftened by this Speech, who is it that
obliges you to lay aſide that Reſpect you ſeem
to acknowlege is due to your Uncle?</p>
               <p>You do, Sir, replied ſhe; and 'tis with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Sorrow, that I beheld you aſſuming a
Character unbecoming the Brother of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This is pretty plain, indeed, interrupted Sir
<hi>Charles:</hi> But pray, Madam, inform me, what
it is you complain of.</p>
               <p>You, queſtionleſs, know much better than I
can tell you, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> bluſhing, the
Offence I accuſe you of; nor is it proper for
me to mention, what it would not become me
to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Zounds! cried Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> no longer able
to ſuppreſs his growing Anger, this is enough
to make a Man mad.</p>
               <p>Ah! I beſeech you, Sir, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi>
ſuffer not an unfortunate and ill-judged Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to be the Bane of all your Happineſs and
Virtue: Recall your wandring Thoughts; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the Diſhonour you will bring upon
yourſelf, by perſiſting in ſuch unjuſtifiable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.</p>
               <p>I do not know how it is poſſible to avoid it,
ſaid Sir <hi>Charles;</hi> and, notwithſtanding all this
fine Reaſoning, there are few People but would
fly into greater Extremities; but my Affection
for you makes me.—</p>
               <p>Hold, hold, I conjure you, Sir, interrupted
<hi>Arabella;</hi> force me not to liſten to ſuch injurious
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0005700702:36"/>
Language; carry that odious Affection ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
elſe; and do not perſecute an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Maid, who has contributed nothing to thy
Fault, and is only guilty of too much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for thy Weakneſs.</p>
               <p>Good God, cried Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> ſtarting back,
and looking upon <hi>Arabella</hi> with Aſtoniſhment;
how I pity my Son! What would I not give, if
he did not love this Girl?</p>
               <p>Think not, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> that the Paſſion
your Son has for me, makes your Condition a
bit the worſe; for I would be ſuch as I am,
with reſpect to you, were there no Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
in the World.</p>
               <p>I never thought, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little Pauſe, that any Part of my Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
could give you the Offence you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of, or authorize that Hatred and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
you take the Liberty to expreſs for me:
But ſince it is ſo, I promiſe you, I will quit
your Houſe, and leave you to your ſelf; I have
always been ſolicitous for your Welfare; and,
ungrateful as you are—</p>
               <p>Call me not ungrateful, interrupted <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
again: Heaven is my Witneſs, that had
you not forgot I was your Niece, I would have
always remembred you was my Uncle; and
not only have regarded you as ſuch, but have
looked upon you as another Father, under
whoſe Direction Providence had placed me,
ſince it had deprived me of my real Father; and
whoſe Tenderneſs and Care, might have in
ſome meaſure ſupplied the Loſs I had of him:
But Heaven has decreed it otherwiſe; and ſince
it is his Will, that I ſhould be deprived of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0005700702:37"/>
Comfort and Aſſiſtance my Orphan State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
I muſt ſubmit, without murmuring, to
my Deſtiny. Go then, unfortunate and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Uncle, purſued ſhe, wiping ſome
Tears from her fine Eyes; go, and endeavour
by Reaſon and Abſence to recover thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
and be aſſured, whenever you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me you have triumphed over theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
which now cauſe both our Unhappineſs,
you ſhall have no Cauſe to complain of my
Conduct towards you.</p>
               <p>Finiſhing theſe Words, ſhe left him with ſo
much Speed, that it would have been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for him to have ſtopped her, though he
had intended it: But indeed, he was ſo loſt in
Wonder and Confuſion at a Behaviour for
which he was not able to aſſign any other
Cauſe than Madneſs, that he remained fixed
in the ſame Poſture of Surprize, in which ſhe
had left him; and from which he was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by the Voice of his Son, who, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Arabella</hi> flying towards the Houſe in great
ſeeming Emotion, came to know the Reſult of
their Converſation.</p>
               <p>Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who had ſpoken to
his Father before, but had no Anſwer, will
you not inform me, what Succeſs you have had
with my Couſin? How did ſhe receive your
Propoſal.</p>
               <p>Speak of her no more, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> ſhe
is a proud ungrateful Girl, and unworthy the
Affection you have for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who trembled to hear ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable
an Anſwer to his Inquiries, was
ſtruck dumb with his Surprize and Grief; when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0005700702:38"/>
Sir <hi>Charles</hi> taking Notice of the Alteration in
his Countenance;</p>
               <p>I am ſorry, ſaid he, to find you have ſet
your Heart upon this fantaſtic Girl: If ever
ſhe be your Wife, which I very much doubt,
ſhe will make you very unhappy: But, <hi>Charles,</hi>
purſued he, I would adviſe you to think no
more of her; content yourſelf with the Eſtate
you gain by her Refuſal of you: With that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to your own Fortune, you may pretend
to any Lady whatever; and you will find many
that are full as agreeable as your Couſin, who
will be proud of your Addreſſes.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> with a Sigh,
there is no Woman upon Earth whom I would
chooſe to marry, but Lady <hi>Bella:</hi> I flattered
myſelf, I had been happy enough to have made
ſome Progreſs in her Affection; but it ſeems, I
was miſtaken; however, I ſhould be glad to
know, if ſhe gave you any Reaſons for refuſing
me.</p>
               <p>Reaſons! ſaid Sir <hi>Charles:</hi> There is no mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her hear Reaſon, or expecting Reaſon from
her; I never knew ſo ſtrange a Woman in my
Life: She would not allow me to ſpeak what
I intended concerning you; but interrupted me,
every Moment, with ſome high-flown Stuff or
other.</p>
               <p>Then I have not loſt all Hopes of her, cried
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> eagerly; for ſince ſhe did not
hear what you had to ſay, ſhe could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
deny you.</p>
               <p>But ſhe behaved in a very impertinent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to me, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles;</hi> complained
of my harſh Treatment of her; and ſaid ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0005700702:39"/>
other Things, which, becauſe of her uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Style, I could not perfectly underſtand;
yet they ſeemed ſhocking; and, upon the Whole,
treated me ſo rudely, that I am determined to
leave her to herſelf, and trouble my Head no
more about her.</p>
               <p>For God's ſake, dear Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
alarmed at this Reſolution, ſuſpend your
Anger, till I have ſeen my Couſin: There is
ſome Miſtake, I am perſuaded, in all this. I
know ſhe has ſome very odd Humours, which
you are not ſo well acquainted with, as I am.
I'll go to her, and prevail upon her to explain
herſelf.</p>
               <p>You may do ſo, if you pleaſe, replied Sir
<hi>Charles;</hi> but I fear it will be to very little Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for I really ſuſpect her Head is a little
turned: I do not know what to do with her:
It is not fit ſhe ſhould have the Management of
herſelf; and yet 'tis impoſſible to live upon eaſy
Terms with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who did not doubt but <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
had been guilty of ſome very ridiculous
Folly, offered nothing more in her Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but, having attended his Father to his own
Chamber went to <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Apartment.</p>
               <p>He found the penſive Fair-one, in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Poſture, her Head reclined upon one
of her fair Hands; and though her Eyes were
fixed upon a Book ſhe held in the other, yet
ſhe did not ſeem to read, but rather to be
wholly buried in Contemplation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> having ſo happily found her
alone (for her Women were not then in her
Chamber) ſeated himſelf near her; having firſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0005700702:40"/>
aſked Pardon for the Interruption he had given
to her Studies; and <hi>Arabella,</hi> throwing aſide her
Book, prepared to liſten to his Diſcourſe;
which by the Agitation, which appeared in
Looks, ſhe imagined, would be upon ſome
extraordinary Subject.</p>
               <p>I left my Father juſt now, ſaid he, in a
great deal of Uneaſineſs, on account of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
you ſaid to him, Lady <hi>Bella:</hi> He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
you are diſobliged, and he would
willingly know how.</p>
               <p>Has your Father then acquainted you with
the Subject of our Converſation? interrupted
<hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know what would have been the Subject of
your Converſation, replied Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> if
you had been pleaſed to liſten to what Sir
<hi>Charles</hi> intended to ſay to you on my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
               <p>On your Behalf? interrupted <hi>Arabella:</hi> Ah
poor deceived <hi>Glanville!</hi> how I pity thy blind
Sincerity! But it is not for me to undeceive
thee: Only thus much I muſt ſay to you, Beware
of committing your Intereſts to a Perſon, who
will be a much better Advocate for another
than for you.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> rejoiced to find by theſe
Words, that her Reſentment againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was occaſioned by a Suſpicion ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for him, aſſured her, that Sir <hi>Charles</hi>
wiſhed for nothing more earneſtly, than that he
might be able to merit her Eſteem; and that
it was to diſpoſe her to liſten to his Addreſſes,
that he wanted to diſcourſe with her that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0005700702:41"/>
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> being obliged, through his
Knowlege of his Couſin's Temper, to ſpeak
to her in this diſtant Manner, went on with
his Aſſurances of his Father's Candour in this
Reſpect; and <hi>Arabella,</hi> who would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
her Reaſons for doubting it, only replied,
That ſhe wiſhed Sir <hi>Charles</hi> meant all that he
had ſaid to him; but that ſhe could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
herſelf to believe him ſincere, till his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Actions had convinced her he was ſo.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> impatient to let his Father
know, how greatly he had been miſtaken in
the Cauſe of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Behaviour, made his
Viſit ſhorter than he would otherwiſe have done,
in order to undeceive him.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> when his Son
had repeated the Converſation he had juſt had
with <hi>Arabella,</hi> that ſhe could be ſo fooliſh, as
to imagine, I had a Deſign to propoſe any one
elſe to her but you? What Reaſon have I ever
given her, to think I would not be glad to
have her for my Daughter-in-law? Indeed,
ſhe has ſome odd Ways that are very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
but ſhe is one of the beſt Matches in
<hi>England</hi> for all that: Poor Girl! purſued he,
ſhe had Reaſon to be angry, if that was the
Caſe; and now I remember, ſhe cried, when
I told her I would leave the Houſe; yet her
Spirit was ſo great, that ſhe told me, I might
go. Well, I'll go and make it up with her;
but who could have imagined, ſhe would have
been ſo fooliſh? Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> at the Repetition
of theſe Words, hurried away to <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
Apartment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0005700702:42"/>
Niece, ſaid he at his Entrance, I am come
to aſk you Pardon, for having led you into a
Belief, that I meant—</p>
               <p>'Tis enough, Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella;</hi> I grant
you my Pardon for what is paſt; and as it does not
become me to receive Submiſſions from my
Uncle, while he remembers he is ſo, I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with your Acknowlegements at preſent:
Only to convince me, that this ſudden Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ſincere, avoid, I beſeech you, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
all Occaſions of diſpleaſing me.</p>
               <p>I proteſt, cried Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> that I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended—</p>
               <p>I will not hear you ſay a Word more of your
paſt Intentions, interrupted <hi>Arabella</hi> again: I
have forgot them all; and, while you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to regard me as your Niece, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
remember them to your Diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>Then I may hope, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles</hi>—</p>
               <p>Oh! Heavens! cried <hi>Arabella,</hi> not ſuffering
him to proceed; do you come to inſult me
thus, with a mock Repentance? And has my
Eaſineſs, in being ſo ready to forget the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
you would have done me, made you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
enough to cheriſh an inſolent Hope
that I will ever change my Reſolution?</p>
               <p>How vexatious is this! replied Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
fretting to ſee her continually miſtaking him.
I ſwear to you, by all that is ſacred, that 'tis
my Son, for whom I would ſolicit your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>How! ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> aſtoniſhed, Will you
then be juſt at laſt? And can you reſolve to
plead for that Son, whoſe Intereſt, but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ago, you would have deſtroyed?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0005700702:43"/>
I ſee, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> it is impoſſible to
convince you.</p>
               <p>No, no interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> haſtily; it is
not impoſſible but my own ardent Wiſhes that
it may be ſo, will help to convince me of the
Truth of what you ſay: For in fine, do you
think, I ſhall not be as glad as yourſelf, to find
you capable of acting honourably by your Son;
and to ſee myſelf no longer the Cauſe of the
moſt unjuſtifiable Conduct imaginable?</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was opening his Mouth, to preſs
her in Favour of Mr. <hi>Glanville;</hi> whom, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
her ſtrange Behaviour, he was
glad to find, ſhe loved; when <hi>Arabella</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
him,</p>
               <p>Seek not, I beſeech you, ſaid ſhe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
that Belief I am willing to give your
Words, by any more Attempts at this time
to perſuade me; for truly, I ſhall interpret
your Solicitude no way in your Favour; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if you deſire I ſhould be convinced you
are ſincere, let the Silence I require of you, be
one Proof of it.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who looked exceſſively out of
Countenance at ſuch a peremptory Command
from his Niece, was going out of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in a very ill Humour, when the Dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
ringing, ſhe gave him her Hand, with a
very gracions Air; and permitted him to lead
her into the Dining-room, where they found
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> his Siſter, and Sir <hi>George,</hi> who
had been detained to Dinner by Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>

               <argument>

Queen of the Amazons, with other
curious Anecdotes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LADY <hi>Bella</hi> having recovered her uſual
Chearfulneſs, thro' the Satisfaction ſhe
felt at her Uncle's returning to Reaſon, and
the Abatement ſhe perceived in Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
extreme Melancholy, mixed in the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with that Wit and Vivacity which was
natural to her, and which ſo abſolutely charmed
the whole Company, that not one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
any of her former Extravagancies.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> gazed on her with a paſſionate
Tenderneſs, Sir <hi>George</hi> with Admiration, and
the old Baronet with Wonder and Delight.</p>
               <p>But Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was inwardly vexed
at the Superiority her Couſin's Wit gave her
over herſelf, wiſhed for nothing more than an
Opportunity of interrupting a Converſation in
which ſhe could have no Share; and, willing
to put them in mind of ſome of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
ſtrange Notions, when ſhe obſerved them
diſputing concerning ſome of the Actions of
the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhe very innocently aſked
Sir <hi>George,</hi> Whether in former times Women
went to the Wars, and fought like Men? For
my Couſin, added ſhe, talks of one <hi>Thaltris,</hi> a
Woman, that was as courageous as any Soldier
whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0005700702:45"/>
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> horridly vexed at a Queſtion
that was likely to engage <hi>Arabella</hi> in a Diſcourſe
very different from that ſhe had been ſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of pleaſing in, frowned very intelligibly at
his Siſter; and, to prevent any Anſwer being
given to her abſurd Demand, directed ſome
other Converſation to <hi>Arabella:</hi> But ſhe, who
ſaw a favourite Subject ſtarted, took no Notice
of what Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was ſaying to her; but,
directing her Looks to Sir <hi>George,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſaid ſhe, be a little
miſtaken in the Name of that fair Queen ſhe
has mentioned; yet I am perſuaded you know
whom ſhe means; and that it is the renowned
<hi>Thaleſtris,</hi> whoſe Valour ſtaggers her Belief,
and of whom ſhe wants to be informed.</p>
               <p>Ay, ay, <hi>Thaleſtris,</hi> ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville:</hi> It
is ſuch a ſtrange Name I could not remember
it; but, pray, was there ever ſuch a Perſon?</p>
               <p>Certainly, Madam, there was, replied Sir
<hi>George:</hi> She was Queen of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Nation of Women, who poſſeſſed great
Part of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and extended their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
ſo far, that they became formidable to
all their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>You find, Miſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> I did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to impoſe upon you, when I told you
of the admirable Valour of that beautiful
Queen; which indeed was ſo great, that the
united Princes, in whoſe Cauſe ſhe fought,
looked upon her Aſſiſtance to be equal to that
of a whole Army; and they honoured her,
accordingly, with the moſt diſtinguiſhing Marks
of their Eſteem and Acknowlegement, and
offered her the chief Command of their Forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0005700702:46"/>
O ſhameful! cried Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> offer a
Woman the Command of an Army! Brave
Fellows indeed, that would be commanded by
a Woman! Sure your miſtake, Niece; there
never was ſuch a thing heard of in the World.</p>
               <p>What, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> will you contradict
a Fact atteſted by the greateſt Hiſtorians that
ever were? You may as well pretend to ſay,
there never were ſuch Perſons as <hi>Oroondates</hi> or
<hi>Juba,</hi> as diſpute the Exiſtence of the famous
<hi>Thaleſtris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, pray, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who
were thoſe?</p>
               <p>One of them, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> was the
great King of <hi>Scythia;</hi> and the other, Prince
of the Two <hi>Mauritanias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ods-heart! interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> I believe
their Kingdoms are in the Moon: I never heard
of <hi>Scythia,</hi> or the Two <hi>Mauritanias,</hi> before.</p>
               <p>And yet, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
are doubtleſs as well known, as <hi>France</hi>
or <hi>England;</hi> and there is no Queſtion, but the
Deſcendants of the great <hi>Oroondates,</hi> and the
valiant <hi>Juba,</hi> ſway the Sceptres of them to this
Day.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi> I have a
very great Admiration for thoſe Two renowned
Princes, and have read their beautiful Exploits
with infinite Pleaſure; notwithſtanding which,
I am more inclined to eſteem the great <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi>
then either of them.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Artaban,</hi> replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> is without
Queſtion, a Warrior equal to either of them,

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0005700702:47"/>
your Partiality proceeds from another Cauſe;
and you having the Honour to reſemble him in
ſome little Infidelities he was accuſed of, with
leſs Juſtice than yourſelf perhaps, induces you
to favour him more than any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> bluſhed when ſhe ended theſe
Words: And Sir <hi>George</hi> replied, with a Sigh;</p>
               <p>I have, indeed, the Honour, Madam, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the great <hi>Artaban,</hi> in having dared to
raiſe my Thoughts towards a Divine Perſon,
who, with Reaſon, condemns my Adorations.</p>
               <p>Hey-day! cried Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> are you going
to ſpeak of Divine Things, after all the Fables
you have been talking of? Troth, I love to
hear young Men enter upon ſuch Subjects: But
pray, Niece, who told you Sir <hi>George</hi> was an
Infidel?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> replied <hi>Arabella:</hi> And I am
inclined to think he ſpoke Truth; for Sir
<hi>George</hi> has never pretended to deny it.</p>
               <p>How! interrupted Sir <hi>Charles;</hi> I am ſorry
to hear that. I hope you have never, added
he, looking at the young Baronet, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to corrupt my Son with any of your
Free-thinking Principles: I am for every
body having Liberty of Conſcience; but I
cannot endure to hear People of your Stamp
endeavouring to propagate your miſchievous
Notions; and becauſe you have no Regard for
your own future Happineſs, diſturbing other
People in the laudable Purſuit of theirs.</p>
               <p>We will not abſolutely condemn Sir <hi>George,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> till we have heard his Hiſtory
from his own Mouth, which he promiſed, ſome
time ago, to relate when I deſired it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0005700702:48"/>
I do not imagine his Hiſtory is fit to be heard
by Ladies, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles;</hi> for your Infidels
live a ſtrange kind of Life.</p>
               <p>However that may be, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> we
muſt not diſpenſe with Sir <hi>George</hi> from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
his Promiſe: I dare ſay there are no
Ladies here, who will think the worſe of him
for freely confeſſing his Faults.</p>
               <p>You may anſwer for yourſelf, if you pleaſe,
Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles;</hi> but I hope my Girl
there, will not ſay as much.</p>
               <p>I dare ſay my Couſin is not ſo rigid, ſaid
<hi>Arabella:</hi> She has too much the Spirit of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
in her, to find Fault with a little Infidelity.</p>
               <p>I am always obliged to you for your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,
Couſin, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville:</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this is greatly to my Advantage too.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi> Lady
<hi>Bella</hi> has done you no Injury by the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſhe has juſt now made; for <hi>Julia</hi> was one
of the fineſt Princeſſes in the World.</p>
               <p>Yet ſhe was not free from the Suſpicion of
Infidelity, replied <hi>Arabella;</hi> but though I do
not pretend to tax my Couſin with that Fault,
yet it is with a great deal of Reaſon that I ſay
ſhe reſembles her in her volatile Humour.</p>
               <p>I was never thought to be ill-humoured in
my Life, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring;
and I cannot imagine what Reaſon I
have given you for ſaying I am.</p>
               <p>Nay, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
your Humour; for, to ſay the Truth,
there are a great many Charms in a volatile
Diſpoſition; and, notwithſtanding the admirable
Beauty of <hi>Julia,</hi> it is poſſible ſhe made as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0005700702:49"/>
many Slaves by her light and airy Carriage, as
ſhe did by her Eyes, though they were the
faireſt in the World, except the divine <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleopatra!</hi> cried Sir <hi>Charles:</hi> Why ſhe was
a Gypſey, was ſhe not?</p>
               <p>I never heard her called ſo, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
gravely; and I am apt to believe you are not at
all acquainted with her: But pray, purſued ſhe,
let us wave this Diſcourſe at preſent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to liſten to Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Relation of his
Life; which, I dare ſay, is full of very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Events: However, Sir, added ſhe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
her Speech to the young Baronet, I am
afraid your Modeſty will induce you to ſpeak
with leſs Candour than you ought, of thoſe
great Actions, which queſtionleſs you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
Therefore we ſhall hear your Hiſtory,
with greater Satisfaction, from the Mouth of
your faithful 'Squire, who will not have the
ſame Reaſons that you have, for ſuppreſſing
what is moſt admirable in the Adventures of
your Life.</p>
               <p>Since it is your Pleaſure, Madam, replied
Sir <hi>George,</hi> to hear my Adventures, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
them as well as I am able my ſelf, to
the end that I may have an Opportunity of
obliging you by doing ſome Violence to my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Modeſty, which will not ſuffer me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Things the World have been pleaſed to
ſpeak of to my Advantage, without ſome little
Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Then, caſting down his Eyes, he ſeemed to
be recollecting the moſt material Paſſages in his
Life. Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> though he could have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0005700702:50"/>
wiſhed he had not indulged <hi>Arabella</hi> in her ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Requeſt, was not able to deny himſelf
the Diverſion of hearing what Kind of Hiſtory
he would invent; and therefore reſolved to ſtay
and liſten to him.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> was alſo highly delighted with
the Propoſal; but Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who could not
conceive there could be any thing worth
liſtening to, in a young Rake's Account of
himſelf, got up with an Intention to walk in
the Garden; when, perceiving it rained, he
changed his Reſolution, and, reſuming his Seat,
prepared to liſten, as every one elſe did, to the
expected Story.</p>
               <p>When Sir <hi>George,</hi> after having pauſed a
Quarter of an Hour longer, during which all
the Company obſerved a profound Silence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his Relation in this Manner, addreſſing

you behold me in the Quality of a
private Gentleman, in the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
only of a tolerable Eſtate;
yet my Birth is illuſtrious enough:
My Anceſtors having formerly worn a Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which, as they won by their Valour, ſo they loſt
by their Misfortune only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0005700702:52"/>
How, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> are you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from Kings? Why, I never heard you
ſay ſo before: Pray, Sir, how far are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from Royal Blood? and which of your
Forefathers was it that wore a Crown?</p>
               <p>Sir, replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> it is not much more
than Eight hundred Years ſince my Anceſtors,
who were <hi>Saxons,</hi> ſwayed the Sceptre of <hi>Kent;</hi>
and from the firſt Monarch of that mighty
Kingdom, am I lineally deſcended.</p>
               <p>Pray where may that Kingdom of <hi>Kent</hi> lie?
ſaid Sir <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In—replied Sir <hi>George.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A mighty Kingdom indeed! ſaid Sir <hi>Charles:</hi>
Why, it makes but a very ſmall Part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Britain</hi> now: Well, if your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
were Kings of that County as it is now
called, it muſt be confeſſed their Dominions
were very ſmall.</p>
               <p>However that may be, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> it raiſes
Sir <hi>George</hi> greatly in my Eſteem, to hear he is
deſcended from Kings; for, truly, a Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
does infinitely ſet off noble and valiant
Actions, and inſpires only lofty and generous
Sentiments: Therefore, illuſtrious Prince (for
in that Light I ſhall always conſider you), be
aſſured, though Fortune has deſpoiled you of
your Dominions, yet ſince ſhe cannot deprive
you of your Courage and Virtue, Providence
will one Day aſſiſt your noble Endeavours to
recover your Rights, and place you upon the
Throne of your Anceſtors, from whence you
have been ſo inhumanly driven: Or, haply, to
repair that Loſs, your Valour may procure you
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0005700702:53"/>
other Kingdoms, no leſs conſiderable than that
to which you was born.</p>
               <p>For Heaven's ſake, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
How come ſuch improbable Things into your
Head? Is it ſuch an eaſy Matter, think you, to
conquer Kingdoms, that you can flatter a young
Man, who has neither Fleets nor Armies, with
ſuch ſtrange Hopes?</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Artaban,</hi> Sir, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi>
had neither Fleets nor Armies, and was Maſter
only of a ſingle Sword; yet he ſoon ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
greater than any King, diſpoſing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies
of Monarchs by his Will, and deciding
the Fates of Empires by a ſingle Word: But
pray let this Diſpute reſt where it is, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Sir <hi>George</hi> to continue his Relation.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary, Madam, reſumed Sir
<hi>George,</hi> to acquaint you with the Misfortunes
of my Family, or relate the ſeveral Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
it made towards the private Condition in
which it now is: For, beſides that reciting the
Events of ſo many Hundred Years may haply,
in ſome meaſure, try your Patience, I ſhould
be glad if you would diſpenſe with me from
entering into a Detail of Accidents that would
ſenſibly afflict me: It ſhall ſuffice, therefore, to
inform you, that my Father, being a peaceable
Man, fond of Retirement and Tranquillity,
made no Attempts to recover the Sovereignty
from which his Anceſtors had been unjuſtly
expelled; but quietly beheld the Kingdom of
<hi>Kent</hi> in the Poſſeſſion of other Maſters, while
he contented himſelf with the Improvement of
that ſmall Pittance of Ground, which was all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0005700702:54"/>
that the unhappy Prince <hi>Veridomer,</hi> my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
was able to bequeath to him.</p>
               <p>Hey-day! cried Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> Will you new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſten
your Grandfather, when he has been
in his Grave theſe Forty Years? I knew ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Sir <hi>Edmard Bellmour</hi> very well, though I
was but a Youth when he died; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no Perſon in <hi>Kent</hi> ever gave him the
Title of Prince <hi>Veridomer:</hi> Fie! fie! theſe are
idle Brags.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> without taking Notice of the old
Baronet's Heat, went on with his Narration in
this manner:</p>
               <p>Things were in this State, Madam, when I
was born. I will not trouble you with the
Relation of what I did in my Infancy.</p>
               <p>No, pray ſkip over all that, interrupted Sir
<hi>Charles;</hi> I ſuppoſe your Infancy was like other
Peoples? What can there be worth hearing in
that?</p>
               <p>You are deceived, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella:</hi> The
Infancy of illuſtrious Perſonages has always
ſomething very extraordinary in it; and from
their childiſh Words and Actions there have
been often Preſages drawn of their future
Greatneſs and Glory.</p>
               <p>Not to diſoblige Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> however, ſaid
the young Prince of <hi>Kent,</hi> I will not repeat
many things, which I ſaid and did in the firſt
Years of my Life, that thoſe about me thought
very ſurpriſing; and from them prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
that very ſtrange Accidents would befal
me.</p>
               <p>I have been a Witneſs of ſome very unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Prognoſtics of you, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0005700702:55"/>
ſmiling; for you was the moſt unlucky bold
Spark, that ever I knew in my Life.</p>
               <p>'Tis very certain, purſued Sir <hi>George,</hi> that the
Forwardneſs of my Spirit gave great Uneaſineſs
to my Father; who, being, as I ſaid before, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to a peaceable and ſedentary Life, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
as much as poſſible to repreſs that
Vivacity in my Diſpoſition, which he feared
might involve me in dangerous Enterprizes.
The Pains he took in my Education, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed
by a more than ordinary Docility:
and, before I was Thirteen, performed all my
Exerciſes with a marvelous Grace; and, if I
may dare ſay ſo, was, at thoſe early Years, the
Admiration and Wonder of all that ſaw me.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Bella</hi> had ſome Reaſon to fear your
Modeſty, I find, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> ſmiling; for,
methinks you really ſpeak too ſlightly of your
Excellencies.</p>
               <p>However that may be, reſumed Sir <hi>George;</hi>
my Father ſaw theſe early Inſtances of a tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Genius in me, with a Pleaſure, chaſtened
by his Fears, that the Grandeur of my Courage
would lead me to attempt ſomething for the
Recovery of that Kingdom, which was my
Due; and which might haply occaſion his loſing
me.</p>
               <p>Poſſeſſed with theſe Thoughts, he carefully
avoided ſaying any thing to me concerning the
glorious Pretences, to which my Birth gave me
a Right; and often wiſhed it had been poſſible
for him to conceal from me, that I was the
true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom of <hi>Kent;</hi>
a Circumſtance he never choſe to mention to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0005700702:56"/>
any Perſon, and would have been glad, if it
had always remained a Secret.</p>
               <p>And ſo it was a Secret, interrupted Sir
<hi>Charles;</hi> for, till this Day, I never heard of it;
and it might ſtill have been a Secret, if you had
pleaſed; for nobody, I dare ſay, would ſuſpect
ſuch a Thing; and very few, I believe, will
be inclined to think there is any thing in ſuch
an improbable Tale.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all my Father's Endeavours
to the contrary, Madam, purſued Sir <hi>George,</hi>
I cheriſhed thoſe towering Sentiments, the
Knowledge of my Birth inſpired me with; and
it was not without the utmoſt Impatience, that
I brooked the private Condition, to which I
found myſelf reduced.</p>
               <p>Cruel Fate! would I ſometimes cry; was it
not enough to deprive me of that Kingdom,
which is my Due, and, ſubject me to a mean,
and inglorious State; but, to make that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
infinitely more grievous, muſt thou give
me a Soul, towering above my abject For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
A Soul, that cannot but diſdain the baſe
Submiſſion, I muſt pay to thoſe, who triumph
in the Spoils of my ruined Houſe? A Soul,
which ſees nothing above its Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations?
And, in fine, a Soul, that excites
me daily to attempt Things worthy of my
Birth, and thoſe noble Sentiments I inherit
from my great Forefathers? Ah! purſued I,
unhappy <hi>Bellmour;</hi> what hinders thee from
making thyſelf known and acknowleged for
what thou art? What hinders thee from bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſerting thy juſt and natural Rights; and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0005700702:57"/>
from defying the Uſurper, who detains them
from thee? What hinders thee, I ſay?</p>
               <p>What? Interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> why the
Fear of a Halter, I ſuppoſe: There is nothing
more eaſy than to anſwer that Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Such, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi> were the
Thoughts, which continually diſturbed my
Imagination; and, doubtleſs, they had not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to puſh me on to ſome hazardous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
had not a fatal Paſſion interpoſed; and
by its ſweet, but dangerous Allurements,
ſtifled for a while that Flame, which Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Love of Glory, kindled in my
Soul.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> here pauſing, and fixing his Eyes
with a melancholy Air on the Ground, as if
preſt with a tender Remembrance;</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> aſked him, ſimiling, If the
Thoughts of poor <hi>Dolly</hi> diſturbed him? Pray,
added he, give us the Hiſtory of your firſt
Love, without any Mixture of Fable; or ſhall
I take the Trouble off you? For you know, I
am very well acquainted with your Affair with
the pretty Milk-maid, and can tell it very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, Sir, ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi> ſighing, I
cannot recall the Idea of <hi>Dorothea,</hi> into my
Remembrance, without ſome Pain: That fair,
but unfaithful Shepherdeſs, who firſt taught me
to ſigh, and repaid my Tenderneſs with the
blackeſt Infidelity: Yet I will endeavour to
compoſe myſelf, and go on with my Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſed to know then, Madam, purſued
Sir <hi>George,</hi> that having my Thoughts, in this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0005700702:58"/>
manner, wholly employed with the Diſaſters
of my Family, I had arrived to my ſeventeenth
Year, without being ſenſible of the Power of
Love; but the Moment now arrived, which
was to prove fatal to my Liberty. Following
the Chace one Day with my Father, and ſome
other Gentlemen, I happened to lag a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them; and, being taken up with my ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Reflections, I loſt my Way, and wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a long time, without knowing or conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whither I was going. Chance at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
me to a pleaſant Valley, ſurrounded
with Trees; and, being tired with riding, I
lighted, and tying my Horſe to a Tree, walked
forward, with an Intention to repoſe myſelf a
few Moments under the Shade of one of thoſe
Trees, that had attracted my Obſervation: But
while I was looking for the moſt convenient
Place, I ſpied, at the Diſtance of ſome few
Yards from me, a Woman lying aſleep upon
the Graſs: Curioſity tempted me to go nearer
this Perſon; and, advancing ſoftly, that I
might not diſturb her, I got near enough to
have a View of her Perſon: But, ah! Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
what Wonders did my Eyes encounter
in this View!—The Age of this fair Sleeper
ſeemed not to exceed Sixteen; her Shape was
formed with the exacteſt Symmetry; one of her
Hands ſupported her Head; the other, as it
lay careleſly ſtretched at her Side, gave me an
Opportunity of admiring its admirable Colour
and Proportion: The thin Covering upon her
Neck diſcovered Part of its inimitable Beauty
to my Eyes; but her Face, her lovely Face,
fixed all my Attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0005700702:59"/>
Certain it is, Madam, that, out of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
it would be hard to find any thing ſo
perfect, as what I now viewed. Her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
was the pureſt White imaginable,
heightened by the inchanting Glow, which
dyed her fair Cheeks with a Colour like that
of a new-blown Roſe: Her Lips, formed with
the greateſt Perfection, and of a deeper Red,
ſeemed to receive new Beauties from the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance
of that Breath, that parted from them:
Her auburn Hair fell in looſe Ringlets over her
Neck; and ſome ſtraggling Curls, that played
upon her fair Forehead, ſet off by a charming
Contraſt the Whitneſs of that Skin it partly
hid: Her Eyes indeed were cloſed; and though
I knew not whether their Colour and Beauty
were equal to thoſe other Miracles in her Face,
yet their Proportion ſeemed to be large; and
the ſnowy Lids, which covered them, were
admirably ſet off by thoſe long and fable Laſhes
that adorned them.</p>
               <p>For ſome Moments I gazed upon this love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sleeper, wholly loſt in Wonder and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Where, whiſpered I, where has this Miracle
been concealed, that my Eyes were never bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the Sight of her before? Theſe Words,
though I uttered them ſoftly, and with the
utmoſt Caution; yet by the murmuring Noiſe
they made, cauſed an Emotion in the beauteous
Sleeper, that ſhe ſtarted, and preſently after
opened her Eyes: But what Words ſhall I find
to expreſs the Wonder, the Aſtoniſhment, and
Rapture, which the Sight of thoſe bright Stars
inſpired me with? The Flames which darted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0005700702:60"/>
from thoſe glorious Orbs, caſt ſuch a dazling
Splendor upon a Sight too weak to bear a
Radiance ſo unuſual, that, ſtepping back a few
Paces, I contemplated at a Diſtance, that
Brightneſs, which began already to kindle a
conſuming Fire in my Soul.</p>
               <p>Bleſs me! interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
at ſo pompous a Deſcription; who
could this be?</p>
               <p>The pretty Milk-maid, <hi>Dolly Acorn,</hi> replied
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> gravely: Did you never ſee her,
Sir, when you was at your Seat, at—?
She uſed often to bring Cream to my Lady.</p>
               <p>Aye, aye, replied Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> I remember
her: She was a very pretty Girl: And ſo it was
from her Eyes, that all thoſe Splendors and
Flames came, that had like to have burnt you
up, Sir <hi>George:</hi> Well, well, I gueſs how the
Story will end: Pray let us hear it out.</p>
               <p>I have already told you, Madam, reſumed
Sir <hi>George,</hi> the marvelous Effects the Sight of
thoſe bright Eyes produced upon my Spirit: I
remained fixed in a Poſture of Aſtoniſhment
and Delight; and all the Faculties of my Soul
were ſo abſorbed in the Contemplation of the
Miracles before me, that I believe, had ſhe
ſtill continued before my Eyes, I ſhould never
have moved from the Place where I then ſtood:
But the fair Virgin, who had ſpied me at the
ſmall Diſtance to which I was retired, turned
haſtily about, and flew away with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Swiftneſs.</p>
               <p>When Love, now lending me Wings, whom
Admiration had before made motionleſs, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
her ſo eagerly, that at laſt I overtook her;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0005700702:61"/>
and, throwing myſelf upon my Knees before
her,</p>
               <p>Stay, I conjure you, cried I; and if you be
a Divinity, as your celeſtial Beauty makes me
believe, do not refuſe the Adoration I offer
you: But if, as I moſt ardently wiſh, you are
a Mortal, though ſure the faireſt that ever
graced the Earth; ſtop a Moment, to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Man, whoſe Reſpects for you as a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
fall little ſhort of thoſe Adorations he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
you as a Goddeſs.</p>
               <p>I can't but think, cried Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> laughing,
how poor <hi>Dolly</hi> muſt be ſurpriſed at ſuch a rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domontade
Speech!</p>
               <p>Oh, Sir! replied Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> you will
find ſhe will make as good a one.</p>
               <p>Will ſhe, by my Troth, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles.</hi> I
don't know how to believe it.</p>
               <p>This Action, purſued Sir <hi>George,</hi> and the
Words I uttered, a little ſurpriſed that fair
Maid, and brought a Bluſh into her lovely
Cheeks; but, recovering herſelf, ſhe replied
with an admirable Grace,</p>
               <p>I am no Divinity, ſaid ſhe; and therefore
your Adorations are miſplaced: But if, as you
ſay, my Countenance moves you to any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
for me, give me a Proof of it, by not
endeavouring to hold any further Diſcourſe
with me, which is not permitted me from one
of your Sex and Appearance.</p>
               <p>A very wiſe Anſwer, indeed! interrupted
Sir <hi>Charles</hi> again: Very few Town Ladies
would have diſclaimed the Title of Goddeſs, if
their Lovers had thought proper to beſtow it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0005700702:62"/>
upon them. I am mightily pleaſed with the Girl
for her Ingenuity.</p>
               <p>The Diſcretion of ſo young a Damſel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
Sir <hi>George,</hi> charmed me no leſs than her
Beauty; and I beſought her, with the utmoſt
Earneſtneſs, to permit me a longer Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with her.</p>
               <p>Fear not, lovely Virgin, ſaid I, to liſten to
the Vows of a Man, who, till he ſaw you,
never learnt to ſigh: My Heart, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
its Liberty againſt the Charms of many
admirable Ladies, yields, without Reluctance,
to the pleaſing Violence your Beauties lay
upon me. Yes, too charming and dangerous
Stranger, I am no longer my own Maſter: It
is in your Power to diſpoſe of my Deſtiny:
Conſider therefore, I beſeech you, whether you
can conſent to ſee me die? For I ſwear to
you, by the moſt ſacred Oaths, unleſs you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to have ſome Compaſſion on me, I will
no longer behold the Light of Day.</p>
               <p>You may eaſily conceive, Madam, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
this lovely Maid in the Character of
a Shepherdeſs, in which ſhe appeared, I made
her a Declaration of my Paſſion, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
myſelf obliged to obſerve thoſe Reſpects,
which, to a Perſon of equal Rank with myſelf,
Decorum would not have permitted me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.</p>
               <p>However, ſhe repelled my Boldneſs with
ſo charming a Modeſty, that I began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
ſhe might be a Perſon of illuſtrious Birth,
diſguiſed under the mean Habit ſhe wore: But,
having requeſted her to inform me who ſhe was,
ſhe told me, her Name was <hi>Dorothea;</hi> and that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0005700702:63"/>
ſhe was Daughter to a Farmer, that lived in
the neighbouring Valley. This Knowlege in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
my Confidence, I talked to her of my
Paſſion, without being the leaſt afraid of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
her.</p>
               <p>And therein you was greatly to blame, ſaid
<hi>Arabella:</hi> For, truly, though the fair <hi>Dorothea</hi>
told you, ſhe was Daughter to a Farmer; yet,
in all Probability, ſhe was of a much higher
Extraction, if the Picture you have drawn of
her be true.</p>
               <p>The fair <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Armenia,</hi> was
conſtrained for a while to conceal her true
Name and Quality, and paſs for a ſimple
Country-woman, under the Name of <hi>Delia:</hi>
Yet the generous <hi>Philadelph,</hi> Prince of <hi>Cilicia,</hi>
who ſaw and loved her under that Diſguiſe,
treated her with all the Reſpect he would have
done, had he known ſhe was the Daughter of a
King. In like manner, Prince <hi>Philoxipes,</hi> who
fell in Love with the beautiful <hi>Policrete,</hi> before
he knew ſhe was the Daughter of the great
<hi>Solon;</hi> and while he looked upon her as a poor
Stranger, born of mean Parents; nevertheleſs,
his Love ſupplying the Want of thoſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Birth and Fortune, he wooed her with
a Paſſion as full of Awe and Delicacy, as if her
Extraction had been equal to his own. And
therefore thoſe admirable Qualities the fair
<hi>Dorothea</hi> poſſeſſed, might alſo have convinced
you, ſhe was not what ſhe ſeemed, but, haply,
ſome great Princeſs in Diſguiſe.</p>
               <p>To tell you the Truth, Madam, replied Sir
<hi>George,</hi> notwithſtanding the fair <hi>Dorothea</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
me, ſhe was of a mean Deſcent, I could
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0005700702:64"/>
not eaſily forego the Opinion, that ſhe was of
an illuſtrious Birth: And the Hiſtories of thoſe
fair Princeſſes you have mentioned, coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Mind, I alſo thought it very poſſible,
that this divine Perſon might either be the
Daughter of a great King, or Lawgiver, like
them; but, being wholly engroſſed by the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of my new-born Affection, I liſtened to
nothing, but what moſt flattered my Hopes;
and, addreſſing my lovely Shepherdeſs with all
the Freedom of a Perſon who thinks his Birth
much ſuperior to hers; ſhe liſtened to my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
without any ſeeming Reluctance,
and condeſcended to aſſure me before we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ſhe did not hate me. So fair a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
ſeemed to promiſe me the moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Fortune I could with Reaſon expect. I
parted from my fair Shepherdeſs with a thouſand
Vows of Fidelity; exacting a Promiſe from
her, that ſhe would meet me as often as ſhe
conveniently could, and have the Goodneſs to
liſten to thoſe Aſſurances of inviolable Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
my Paſſion prompted me to offer her.
When ſhe left me, it ſeemed as if my Soul had
forſaken my Body to go after her: My Eyes
purſued her Steps as long as ſhe was in Sight; I
envied the Ground ſhe preſt as ſhe went along,
and the Breezes that kiſſed that celeſtial
Countenance in their Flight.</p>
               <p>For ſome Hours I ſtood in the ſame Poſture
in which ſhe had left me; contemplating the
ſudden Change I had experienced in my Heart,
and the Beauty of that divine Image, which
was now engraven in it. Night drawing on, I
began to think of going home; and, untying my
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0005700702:65"/>
Horſe, I returned the Way I had come; and
at laſt ſtruck into a Road, which brought me
to the Place where I parted from the Company;
from whence I eaſily found my Way home,
ſo changed both in my Looks and Carriage,
that my Father, and all my Friends, obſerved
the Alteration with ſome Surprize.</p>

                  <p>In which Sir George, continuing his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing

Inſtance of a Valour only to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled

               </argument>
               <p>FOR ſome Months, continued Sir <hi>George,</hi>
I proſecuted my Addreſſes to the admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Dorothea;</hi> and I flattered myſelf with a
Hope, that I had made ſome Progreſs in her
Heart: But, alas! this deceitful Fair-one, who
only laughed at the Torments ſhe made me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
at the time ſhe vowed eternal Conſtancy
to me, gave her Hand to a Lover of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
providing, and abandoned me, without
Remorſe, to the moſt cruel Deſpair.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble you, Madam, with the
Repetition of thoſe Complaints, which this
perfidious Action drew from me for a long time.
At length, my Courage enabling me to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Violence of my Grief, I reſolved to
think of the ungrateful <hi>Dorothea</hi> no more; and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0005700702:66"/>
the Sight of another Beauty completing my
Cure, I no longer remembred the unfaithful
Shepherdeſs, but with Indifference.</p>
               <p>Thus, Madam, have I faithfully related one
of thoſe Infidelities, wherewith my Enemies
ſlander me; who can ſupport their Aſſertion,
with no better Proof, than that I did not die,
when <hi>Dorothea</hi> abandoned me: But I ſubmit
it to your Candour, whether an unfaithful
Miſtreſs deſerved ſuch an Inſtance of Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from a Lover ſhe had betrayed?</p>
               <p>Why, really, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> after a little
Pauſe, you had ſome Excuſe to plead for your
Failure in this Point: And though you cannot
be called, the moſt perfect amongſt Lovers,
ſeeing you neither died, nor was in Danger of
dying; yet neither ought you to be ranked
among thoſe who are moſt culpable: But pray
proceed in your Story: I ſhall be better able to
form a right Judgment of your Merit as a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
when I have heard all your Adventures.</p>
               <p>My Paſſion for <hi>Dorothea,</hi> reſumed Sir <hi>George,</hi>
being cured by her Treachery towards me,
the Love of Glory began again to revive in my
Soul. I panted after ſome Occaſion to ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
my Valour, which yet I had met with no
Opportunity of doing; but, hearing that a
mighty Army was preparing to march upon a
ſecret Expedition, I privately quitted my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Seat; and, attended only by my faithful
'Squire, I took the ſame Route the Army had
taken, and arrived the Day before the terrible
Battle of—was fought, where, without
making myſelf known, I performed ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
of Valour, as aſtoniſhed all who beheld
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0005700702:67"/>
me. Without doubt, I ſhould have been highly
careſſed by the Commander, who certainly
would have given me the Honour of a Victory
my Sword alone had procured for him; but,
having unwittingly engaged myſelf too far in
Purſuit of the flying Enemy, I found myſelf
alone, encompaſſed with a Party of about Five
hundred Men; who, ſeeing they were purſued
only by a ſingle Man, faced about, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to kill or take me Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Pray, Sir, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> when did
all this happen? And how came it to paſs, that
your Friends have been ignorant to this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thoſe Prodigies of Valour you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
at that Battle? I never heard you was
ever in a Battle: Fame has done you great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
by concealing the Part you had in that
famous Victory.</p>
               <p>The great Care I took to conceal myſelf,
replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> was one Reaſon why my
Friends did not attribute to me the Exploits,
which the Knight in black Armour, who was
no other than myſelf, performed; and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
I am going to relate, prevented my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcovered, while the Memory of thoſe
great Exploits were yet freſh in the Minds of
thoſe I had ſo greatly obliged.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſed to know, therefore, Madam, that,
ſeeing myſelf about to be encompaſſed by this
Party of the Enemy, I diſdained to fly; and,
though I was alone, reſolved to ſuſtain their
Attack, and ſell my Life as dear as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Why, if you did ſo, you was a Madman,
cried Sir <hi>Charles</hi> in a Heat: The braveſt Man
that ever lived, would not have preſumed to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0005700702:68"/>
fight with ſo great a Number of Enemies. What
could you expect, but to be cut in Pieces?
Pooh! pooh! don't think any body will credit
ſuch a ridiculous Tale: I never knew you was
ſo addicted to—</p>
               <p>Lying, perhaps, the good Knight would have
ſaid; but Sir <hi>George,</hi> who was concerned he
was preſent at his Legend, and could not
blame him for doubting his Veracity, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Utterance of a Word he would be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take ill, by abruptly going on with his
Story.</p>
               <p>Placing my Back therefore againſt a Tree,
purſued he, to prevent my being aſſaulted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
I preſented my Shield to the Boldeſt of
theſe Aſſailants; who, having ſtruck an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Blow upon it, as he was lifting up his Arm
to renew his Attack, I cut it off with one
Stroke of my Sword; and the ſame Inſtant
plunged it to the Hilt in the Breaſt of another,
and clove the Scull of a Third, who was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at me, in two Parts.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> at this Relation, burſt into a
loud Fit of Laughter; and, being more inclined
to divert himſelf, than be offended at the Folly
and Vanity of the young Baronet, he permitted
him to go on with his ſurpriſing Story, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving him any other Interruption.</p>
               <p>Theſe Three Executions, Madam, purſued
Sir <hi>George,</hi> were the Effects only of ſo many
Blows; which raiſed ſuch Indignation in my
Enemies, that they preſt forward in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to deſtroy me; but, having, as I before
ſaid, poſted myſelf ſo advantageouſly, that I
could only be aſſaulted before, not more than
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0005700702:69"/>
Three or Four could attack me at one time. The
Deſire of lengthening out my Life, till happily
ſome Succour might come to my Relief, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated
my Arm, and added to my ordinary
Strength an almoſt irreſiſtible Force, that I dealt
Death at every Blow; and in leſs than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an Hour, ſaw more than Fifty of my
Enemies at my Feet, whoſe Bodies ſerved for a
Bulwark againſt their Fellows Swords.</p>
               <p>The Commander of this little Body, not
having Generoſity enough to be moved with
thoſe prodigious Effects of my Valour in my
Favour, was tranſported with Rage at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;
and the Sight of ſo many of his Men
ſlain before his Face, ſerved only to increaſe
his Fury; and that Moment, ſeeing, that, with
Two more Blows, I had ſent Two of his moſt
valiant Soldiers to the Shades, and that the reſt
fearing to come within the Length of my
Sword, had given me a few Moments Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite,</p>
               <p>Ah! Cowards! cried he, are you afraid of
a ſingle Man? And will you ſuffer <hi>him</hi> to
eſcape from your Vengeance, who has ſlain ſo
many of your brave Comrades before your
Eyes?</p>
               <p>Theſe Words inſpiring them with a Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſuch as he deſired, they advanced towards
me with more Fury than before: By this time,
I had received ſeveral large Wounds, and my
Blood ran down from many Parts of my Body:
Yet was I not ſenſible of any Decay of Strength,
nor did the ſettled Deſigns of my Enemies to
deſtroy me daunt me in the leaſt: I ſtill relied
upon the Aſſiſtance I expected Providence
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0005700702:70"/>
would ſend to my Relief, and determined, if
poſſible, to preſerve my Life, till it arrived.</p>
               <p>I fought, therefore, with a Reſolution, which
aſtoniſhed my Enemies, but did not move them
to any Regard for my Safety: And, obſerving
their brutal Commander, a few Paces from me,
encouraging his Men, both with his Cries and
Geſtures, Indignation againſt this inhuman
Wretch ſo tranſported me out of my Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that I quitted my Poſt, in order to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
him to my Revenge.</p>
               <p>Seeing me advance furiouſly towards him, he
turned pale with Fear, and endeavoured to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himſelf in the midſt of his Men; who, more
valiant than himſelf, oppoſed themſelves to my
Rage, to favour his Retreat: But quickly clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
myſelf a Way with my Sword, I preſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the barbarous Coward; and, ere he could
avoid the Blow I aimed at him, it ſtruck him
ſenſeleſs at my Feet.</p>
               <p>My particular Revenge thus ſatisfied, I was
ſenſible of the Fault I had committed in quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my Poſt, by which I expoſed myſelf to be
ſurrounded by the Enemy. I endeavoured to
regain it, but in vain: I was beſet on all Sides,
and now deſpaired of any Safety; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only fought to die courageouſly, and make
as many of my Enemies as I could, attend
my Fall.</p>
               <p>Exaſperated by the Misfortune of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
they preſſed upon me with redoubled
Fury. Faint as I was, with the Loſs of Blood,
and ſo fatigued with the paſt Action, and the
obſtinate Fight I had maintained ſo long with
ſuch a conſiderable Number, I could hardly any
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0005700702:71"/>
longer lift up my Arm; and, to complete, my
Misfortune, having thruſt my Sword into the
Body of one of the forwardeſt of my Enemies,
in my endeavouring to regain it, it broke in
Pieces, and the Hilt only remained in my Hand.</p>
               <p>This Accident completed my Defeat: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of my Sword, I was no longer capable
of making any Defence: Several of them preſſed
upon me at once; and, throwing me down,
tied my Hands together behind me. Shame and
Rage at this Indignity worked ſo forcibly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Spirts, weakened as I then was, that I
fell into a Swoon. What happened till my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
I am not able to tell; but, at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of my Senſes, I found myſelf laid on a
Bed in a tolerable Chamber, and ſome Perſons
with me, who kept a profound Silence.</p>

               <p>RECOLLECTING in a few Moments

treated with ſo little Severity, conſidering I
was Priſoner to Perſons who had been Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

After reflecting ſome time longer on my
Situation, I called to a young Man, who ſat
near my Bed-ſide, and intreated him to inform
me, Where I was, and to whom I was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner?
But could get no other Anſwer to thoſe
Queſtions, than a moſt civil Intreaty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
myſelf, and not protract the Cure of my
Wounds by talking, which, the Surgeons had
declared, would be of a bad Conſequence;
and had therefore ordered me to be as little
diſturbed as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this Remonſtrance, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
my Requeſt, promiſing to be entirely
governed by them for the future in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
my Health, provided they would ſatisfy
me in thoſe Particulars: But my Attendant did
not ſo much as reply to thoſe Importunities;
but, to prevent the Continuance of them, roſe
from his Seat, and retired to the other End of
the Chamber.</p>
               <p>I paſſed that Day, and ſeveral others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to learn the Truth of my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
All this time, I was diligently waited on
by the two Perſons I had firſt ſeen, neither
of whom I could prevail upon to inform me
of what I deſired to know; and, judging, by
this obſtinate Reſerve, and the Manner of my
Treatment, that there was ſome Myſtery in
the Caſe, I forbore to aſk them any more
Queſtions, conceiving they had particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not to anſwer them.</p>
               <p>The Care that was taken to forward my
Cure, in Three Weeks entirely reſtored me
to Health: I longed impatiently to know,
what was to be my Deſtiny; and buſied myſelf
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0005700702:73"/>
in conjecturing it, in vain; when, one Morning,
an elderly Lady entered my Chamber, at whoſe
Appearance my Two Attendants retired.</p>
               <p>After ſhe had ſaluted me very civilly, and
inquired after my Health, ſhe ſeated herſelf in
a Chair near my Bedſide, and ſpoke to me in
this manner:</p>
               <p>I make no queſtion, Sir, but you are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
at the Manner in which you have been
treated, and the Care there has been taken to
prevent diſcovering to you the Place where
you now are; but you will doubtleſs be more
ſurpriſed, to hear you are in the Fortreſs of—,
and in the Houſe of Prince <hi>Marcomire,</hi> whoſe
Party you fought againſt alone; and whom
you ſo dangerouſly wounded, before you was
taken Priſoner by his Men.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, Madam, ſaid I, who, from
the firſt Moment of her Appearance, had been
in a ſtrange Perplexity, is it poſſible, I am in
the Houſe of a Man, whoſe Life I endeavoured
ſo eagerly to deſtroy? And is it to him, who
oppreſſed me ſo baſely with Numbers, that I
am obliged for the Succour I have received?</p>
               <p>It is not to him, replied the Lady, that you
are obliged for the favourable Treatment you
have had; but liſten to me patiently, and I
will diſcloſe the Truth of your Adventure.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Marcomire,</hi> who was the Perſon that
headed that Party againſt which you ſo valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of Quality, had come for Security: Your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0005700702:74"/>
Purſuit engaged you in the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
Combat that ever was fought; and—</p>
               <p>Nay, Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> though I do
not refuſe to give you all the Praiſes your gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Defence of yourſelf againſt Five hundred
Men deſerves; yet I cannot agree with that
Lady, in ſaying, it was the moſt unequal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
that ever was fought: For, do but reflect, I
beſeech you, upon that which the brave Prince
of <hi>Mauritania</hi> ſuſtained againſt twice that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men, with no other Arms than his
Sword; and, you having been in Battle that
Day, was, as I conceive, completely armed.
The young Prince of <hi>Egypt,</hi> accompanied only
by the valiant, but indiſcreet, <hi>Cepio</hi> his Friend,
engaged all the King of <hi>Armenia</hi>'s Guards,
and put them all to Flight. The courageous
<hi>Ariobaſanes</hi> ſcorned to turn his Back upon a
whole Army; not to mention the invincible
<hi>Artaban,</hi> whom a thouſand Armies together
could not have made to turn.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſed to obſerve, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi>
that to the end I may faithfully recount my
Hiſtory, I am under a Neceſſity of repeating
Things, which, haply, may ſeem too advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
for a Man to ſay of himſelf: Therefore
I indeed greatly approve of the Cuſtom, which,
no doubt, this Inconveniency introduced, of a
'Squire, who is thoroughly inſtructed with the
Secrets of his Maſter's Heart, relating his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
and giving a proper Eulogium of his
rare Valour, without being in Danger of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the Modeſty of the renowned Knight;
who, as you know, Madam, upon thoſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
commodiouſly ſlips away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0005700702:75"/>
It being, however, this Lady's Opinion, that
no Man ever undertook a more hazardous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
or with greater Odds, againſt him, ſhe did
not fail to expreſs her Admiration of it, in very
high Terms.</p>
               <p>The Noiſe of this Accident, purſued ſhe,
was ſoon ſpread over the whole Town; and
the beautiful <hi>Sydimiris, Marcomire</hi>'s Siſter, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that her Brother was wounded, as it was
thought to Death, and that the Perſon who
killed him, was taken Priſoner; ſhe flew out
to meet her wounded Brother, diſtracted with
Grief, and vowing to have the ſevereſt Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
executed on him, who had thus barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
murdered her Brother. Thoſe who bore
that unhappy Prince, having brought him into
the Houſe, his Wounds were ſearched; and
the Surgeons declared, they were very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> hearing this, redoubled her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
and Vows of Vengeance againſt you:
Her Brother having then the chief Authority in
the Place, ſhe commanded, in his Name, to
have you brought hither, and to be moſt ſtrictly
guarded; determined, if her Brother died, to
ſacrifice you to his Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Full of theſe ſanguinary Reſolutions, ſhe
left his Chamber, having ſeen him laid in Bed;
and his Wounds dreſſed; but paſſing along a
Gallery to her own Apartment, ſhe met the
Perſons who were bringing you to the Room
that was to be your Priſon: You was not, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
the Lady, yet recovered from your Swoon,
ſo that they carried you like one that was dead:
They had taken off your Helmet to give you
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0005700702:76"/>
Air; by which means your Face being quite
uncovered, pale, languiſhing, and your Eyes
cloſed, as if in Death, preſented the moſt
moving, and, at the ſame time, moſt pleaſing
Object in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> who ſtopt, and for a Moment
eagerly gazed upon you, loſt all of a ſudden
the Fierceneſs, which before had animated her
againſt you: And lifting up her Eyes to view
thoſe Men that carried you;</p>
               <p>Are you ſure, ſaid ſhe to them, that this is
the Perſon who wounded my Brother?</p>
               <p>Yes, Madam, replied one of them; this muſt
be he, ſince there was no other in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and he alone ſuſtained the Attack of Five
hundred Men; and would probably not have
left one of them alive, had not his Sword, by
breaking, put it into our Power to take him
Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Carry him away, ſaid <hi>Sydimiris;</hi> but let his
Wounds be dreſſed, and let him be carefully
looked to, that, if my Brother dies, he may
be puniſhed as he deſerves.</p>
               <p>Pronouncing theſe Words in a low and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Voice, ſhe turned her Eyes a ſecond time
upon you; then, haſtily averting her Looks,
ſhe hurried to her own Chamber, and threw
herſelf into a Chair, with all the Marks of a
very great Diſturbance.</p>
               <p>The Affection I have for her, being the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who had brought her up, and moſt favoured
with her Confidence, made me behold her in
this Condition with great Concern; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
it was her Brother that diſquieted her,
I beſought her not to give way to the Violence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0005700702:77"/>
of her Grief, but to hope that Heaven would
reſtore him to her Prayers.</p>
               <p>Alas! my dear <hi>Urinoe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I am more
culpable than you can imagine; and I grieve leſs
for the Condition to which I ſee <hi>Marcomire</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
than for that Moderation wherewith I
am conſtrained, ſpite of myſelf, to behold his
Enemy.</p>
               <p>Yes, dear <hi>Urinoe,</hi> purſued ſhe, bluſhing,
and caſting down her Eyes, the Actions of
this Unknown appear to me in quite another
Light, ſince I have ſeen him; and, inſtead of
looking upon him as the Murderer of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I cannot help admiring that rare Valour,
with which he defended himſelf againſt ſo great
a Number of Enemies; and am even ready to
condemn the furious <hi>Marcomire,</hi> for oppreſſing
ſo brave a Man.</p>
               <p>As I had never approved of thoſe violent
Tranſports of Grief and Rage, which ſhe had
expreſſed upon the firſt News of her Brother's
Misfortune; and as I looked upon your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Defence with the utmoſt Admiration; ſo,
far from condemning the Change of her
Thoughts, I confirmed her in the favourable
Opinion ſhe began to entertain of you; and,
continuing to make Remarks upon all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of the Combat, which had come to
our Knowlege, we found nothing in your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
but what increaſed our Admiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sydimiris</hi> therefore, following the Dictates
of her own Generoſity, as well as my Advice,
placed Two Perſons about you, whoſe Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
we could rely on; and gave them Orders
to treat you with all imaginable Care and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0005700702:78"/>
but not to inform you of the Place in
which you was, or to whom you was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Marcomire,</hi> whoſe
Wounds had been again examined, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
out of Danger by the Surgeons; and he
having underſtood the Exceſs of his Siſter's
Grief, and the Revenge ſhe had vowed againſt
you, gave her Thanks for thoſe Expreſſions of
her Tenderneſs; and alſo uttered ſome Threats,
which intimated a violent Hatred againſt you;
and a Deſign of proſecuting his Revenge upon
you, as ſoon as he was in a Condition to leave
his Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> who heard him, could with Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
diſſemble her Concern.</p>
               <p>Ah! <hi>Urinoe,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, when we were
alone; 'tis now, that I more than ever repent
of that Exceſs of Rage, which tranſported me
againſt the brave Unknown. I have thereby
put him intirely into my Brother's Power, and
ſhall be haply acceſſary to that Death he is
meditating for him, or elſe a perpetual Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment.</p>
               <p>This Reflection gave her ſo much Pain, that
I could not chooſe but pity her; and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the only way to preſerve you, was
for her to diſſemble a Rage equal to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comire</hi>'s
againſt you, in order to prevent being
ſuſpected of any Deſign in your Favour, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
her to join with him in every thing he
ſaid; while, in the mean time, we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to get you cured of your Wounds, that
you might at leaſt be in a Condition once more
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0005700702:79"/>
to defend yourſelf with that miraculous Valour
Heaven has beſtowed on you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sydimiris</hi> perceiving her Brother would ſoon
be in a Condition to execute his Threats, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to hazard every thing, rather than to expoſe
you to his Rage: She therefore communicated
to me her Deſign of giving you Liberty, and,
by preſenting a ſufficient Reward to your
Guard, inducing them to favour your Eſcape.</p>
               <p>I undertook to manage this Buſineſs in her
Name, and have done it ſo effectually, that
you will this Night be at Liberty, and may
depart the Town immediately, in which it will
be dangerous to ſtay any time, for fear of
being diſcovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sydimiris</hi> forbad me to let you know the
Perſon to whom you would be obliged for your
Freedom; but I could not endure, that you
ſhould unjuſtly involve the Siſter of <hi>Marcomire,</hi>
in that Reſentment you will queſtionleſs always
preſerve againſt <hi>him;</hi> and to keep you from being
innocently guilty of Ingratitude, I reſolved to
acquaint you with the Nature of thoſe Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
you owe to her.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AH! Madam, ſaid I, perceiving ſhe had
finiſhed her Diſcourſe, doubt not but I
ſhall moſt gratefully preſerve the Remembrance
of what the generous <hi>Sydimiris</hi> has done for me;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0005700702:80"/>
and ſhall always be ready to loſe that Life in
her Defence, which ſhe has had the ſuperlative
Goodneſs to take ſo much Care of. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
purſued I, with an earneſt Look, do not,
I beſeech you, refuſe me one Favour, without
which I ſhall depart with inconceivable Sorrow.</p>
               <p>Depend upon it, valiant Sir, replied ſhe,
that if what you will require of me, be in my
Power, and fit for me to grant, I ſhall very
willingly oblige you.</p>
               <p>It is then, reſumed I, trembling at the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my Requeſt, that you would conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to intreat the moſt generous <hi>Sydimiris</hi> to
favour me with an Interview, and give me an
Opportunity of throwing myſelf at her Feet,
to thank her for all thoſe Favours I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from her Compaſſion.</p>
               <p>I cannot promiſe you, replied the Lady,
riſing, to prevail upon <hi>Sydimiris</hi> to grant you an
Audience; but I aſſure you, that I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to diſpoſe her to do you this Favour; and
it ſhall not be my Fault, if you are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe went out of my Chamber,
I having followed her to the Door, with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
that I would never forget her Kindneſs
upon this Occaſion.</p>
               <p>I paſt the reſt of that Day in an anxious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
for Night, divided between Fear and
Hope, and more taken up with the Thoughts
of ſeeing <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> than with my expected
Liberty.</p>
               <p>Night came at laſt, and the Door of my
Apartment opening, I ſaw the Lady who had
been with me in the Morning, enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0005700702:81"/>
I have prevailed upon <hi>Sydimiris</hi> to ſee you,
ſaid ſhe; and ſhe is willing, at my Intreaty, to
grant that Favour to a Perſon, who, ſhe with
Reaſon thinks, has been inhumanly treated by
her Brother.</p>
               <p>Then, giving me her Hand, ſhe conducted
me along a large Gallery, to a ſtately Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and after traverſing ſeveral Rooms, ſhe
led me into one, where <hi>Sydimiris</hi> herſelf was:
Who, as ſoon as ſhe perceived me, roſe from
her Seat, and received me with great Civility.</p>
               <p>In the Tranſport I then was, I know not
how I returned the grateful Salute the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<hi>Sydimiris</hi> gave me; for moſt certain
it is, that I was ſo loſt in Wonder, at the Sight
of the many Charms I beheld in her Perſon,
that I could not unlock my Tongue, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
my Eyes from her inchanting Face; but
remained fixed in a Poſture, which at once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
my Admiration and Delight.</p>
               <p>To give you a Deſcription of that Beauty
which I then contemplated, I muſt inform
you, Madam, that <hi>Sydimiris</hi> is tall, of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Stature, and admirably proportioned; her
Hair was of the fineſt Black in the World; her
Complexion marvelouſly fair; and all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
of her Viſage were perfectly beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and her Eyes, which were large and black,
ſparkled with ſo quick and piercing a Fire, that
no Heart was able to reſiſt their powerful
Glances: Moreover, <hi>Sydimiris</hi> is admirably
ſhaped; her Port is high and noble; and her
Air ſo free, yet ſo commanding, that there are
few Perſons in the World, with whom ſhe may
not diſpute the Priority of Beauty: In fine,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0005700702:82"/>
Madam, <hi>Sydimiris</hi> appeared with ſo many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
to a Spirit prepoſſeſſed already with
the moſt grateful Senſe of her Favours, that
I could not reſiſt the ſweet Violence wherewith
her Charms took Poſſeſſion of my Heart: I
yielded therefore, without Reluctance, to my
Deſtiny, and reſigned myſelf, in an Inſtant, to
thoſe Fetters, which the Sight of the Divine
<hi>Sydimiris</hi> prepared for me: Recovering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a little from that Admiration, which
had ſo totally ingroſſed all my Faculties, I
threw myſelf at her Feet, with an Action whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compoſed of Tranſport.</p>
               <p>Divine <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> ſaid I, beholding her with
Eyes, in which the Letters of my new-born
Paſſion might very plainly be read, ſee at
your Feet a Man devoted to your Service, by
all the Ties of Gratitude and Reſpect. I come,
Madam, to declare to you, that from the Firſt
Moment you gave me Liberty, I had devoted
that and my Life to you; and at your Feet I
confirm the Gift; proteſting by all that is moſt
dear and ſacred to me, that ſince I hold my
Life from the Divine <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> ſhe alone ſhall
have the abſolute Diſpoſal of it for the future;
and ſhuld ſhe pleaſe again to demand it, either
to appeaſe her Brother's Fury, or to ſacrifice
it to her own Security, I will moſt faithfully
perform her Will, and ſhed the laſt Drop of
that Blood at her Command, which I would
with Tranſport loſe in her Defence.</p>
               <p>A fine high-flown Speech indeed! ſaid Sir
<hi>Charles,</hi> laughing; but I hope you did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to keep your Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0005700702:83"/>
Sure, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> you do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that Sir <hi>George</hi> would have failed in
executing all he had promiſed to the beautiful
and generous <hi>Sydimiris:</hi> What could he poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have ſaid leſs? And indeed what leſs could
ſhe have expected from a Man, whom at the
Hazard of her own Life and Happineſs, ſhe had
given Freedom to?</p>
               <p>I accompanied theſe Words, Madam, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
Sir <hi>George,</hi> with ſo paſſionate a Look and
Accent, that the fair <hi>Sydimiris</hi> bluſhed, and,
for a Moment, caſt down her Eyes with a
viſible Confuſion. At laſt,</p>
               <p>Sir, replied ſhe, I am too well ſatisfied with
what I have done, with reſpect to your Safety,
to require any Proofs of your Gratitude, that
might be dangerous to it; and ſhall remain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
well ſatisfied, if the Obligations you
think you owe me, may induce you to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
your Reſentment againſt my Brother, for
the cruel Treatment you received from him.</p>
               <p>Doubt not, Madam, interrupted I, eagerly,
but I ſhall, in the Perſon of <hi>Marcomire,</hi> regard
the Brother of the divine <hi>Sydimiris;</hi> and that
Conſideration will be ſufficient, not only to
make me forget all the Violences he committed
againſt me, but even to deſend his Life, if need
be, with the Hazard of my own.</p>
               <p>Exceſſively generous indeed! ſaid Sir <hi>Charles:</hi>
I never heard any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Oh! dear, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> there are
numberleſs Inſtances of equal, and even ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Generoſity, to be met with in the L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ves of
the Heroes of Antiquity: You will there ſee
a Lover, whoſe Miſtreſs has been taken from
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0005700702:84"/>
him, either by Treachery or Force, venture
his Life in Defence of the injurious Huſband
who poſſeſſes her; and though all his Felicity
depends upon his Death, yet he will reſcue him
from it, at the Expence of the greater Part of
his Blood.</p>
               <p>Another, who after a long and bloody War,
has, by taking his Enemy Priſoner, an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of terminating it honourably; yet, thro'
an heroick Principle of Generoſity, he gives
his Captive Liberty, without making any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and has all his Work to do over again.</p>
               <p>A Third, having contracted a violent Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with the Enemies of his Country, through
the ſame generous Sentiments, draws his Sword
in their Defence, and makes no Scruple to fight
againſt an Army, where the King his Father
is in Perſon.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
ſeems to me very peculiar, that will make
a Man fight for his Enemies againſt his own
Father.</p>
               <p>It is in that Peculiarity, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
that his Generoſity conſiſts; for certainly there
is nothing extraordinary in fighting for one's
Father, and one's Country; but when a Man
has arrived to ſuch a Pitch of Greatneſs of
Soul, as to neglect thoſe mean and ſelfiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
and, loving Virtue in the Perſons
of his Enemies, can prefer their Glory before
his own particular Intereſt, he is then a perfect
Hero indeed: Such a one was <hi>Oroondates, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxcrxes,</hi>
and many others I could name, who
all gave eminent Proofs of their Diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Greatneſs of Soul, upon the like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0005700702:85"/>
Therefore not, to detract from Sir
<hi>George</hi>'s Merit, I muſt ſtill inſiſt, that in the
Reſolutions he had taken to defend his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Life at the Expence of his own, he did
no more, than what any Man of ordinary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
ought to do, and what he was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
obliged to, by what the amiable <hi>Sydimiris</hi>
had done for him.</p>
               <p>I was ſo happy, however, Madam, continued
Sir <hi>George,</hi> to find that thoſe Expreſſions of my
Gratitude wrought ſomewhat upon the Heart
of the lovely <hi>Sydimiris</hi> in my Favour: Her
Words diſcovered as much, and her Eyes ſpoke
yet more intelligibly; but our Converſation was
interrupted by the diſcreet <hi>Urinoe,</hi> who, fearing
the Conſequence of ſo long a Stay in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
repreſented to me, that it was time to
take my Leave.</p>
               <p>I turned pale at this cruel Sound; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<hi>Sydimiris</hi> with a languiſhing Look,</p>
               <p>Would to Heaven, Madam, ſaid I, that
inſtead of giving me Liberty, you would keep
me eternally your Priſoner; for though a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
was to be the Place of my Confinement,
yet if it was near you, it would ſeem a Palace
to me; for indeed I am no longer in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to reliſh that Freedom you beſtow upon
me, ſince it muſt remove me farther from you:
But I beſeech you, Madam, to believe, that in
delivering me from your Brother's Fetters, you
have caſt me into your own, and that I am more
a Priſoner than ever, but a Priſoner to ſo lovely
a Conqueror, that I do not wiſh to break my
Chains, and prefer the ſweet and glorious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0005700702:86"/>
I am in, to all the Crowns in the
World.</p>
               <p>You are very bold, ſaid <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> bluſhing,
to entertain me with ſuch Diſcourſe; yet I
pardon this Offence, in Conſideration of what
you have ſuffered from my Brother, and on
Condition that you will depart immediately,
without ſpeaking another Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sydimiris</hi> ſpoke this ſo earneſtly, that I durſt
not diſobey her; and, kiſſing the Hem of her
Robe, with a paſſionate Air, I left ber Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
conducted by <hi>Urinoe;</hi> who having brought
me to a private Door, which carried us into
the Street, I there found a Man waiting for
me, whom I knew to be the ſame that had
attended me during my Stay in that Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urinoe</hi> having recommended to him to ſee
me ſafe out of the Town, I took Leave of
her, with the moſt grateful Acknowlegements
for her Kindneſs; and followed my Conductor,
ſo oppreſſed with Grief at the Thoughts of
leaving the Place where <hi>Sydimiris</hi> was, that I
had hardly Strength to walk.</p>

               <p>THE farther I went, continued Sir <hi>George,</hi>
the more my Regret increaſed; and,
finding it would be impoſſible to live, and quit
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0005700702:87"/>
the Divine <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> I all at once took a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to remain in the Town concealed; and,
communicating my Deſign to my Guide, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
him to aſſiſt me in it, by a Preſent of a
conſiderable Sum, which he could not reſiſt:
Accordingly he left me in a remote Part of the
Town, and went to find out a convenient Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for me; which he ſoon procured, and alſo
a Suit of Cloaths to diſguiſe me, my own being
very rich and magnificent.</p>
               <p>Having recommended me as a Relation of
his, who was newly arrived, I was received
very civilly by the People with whom he placed
me; and, finding this young Man to be very
witty and diſcreet, and alſo very capable of
ſerving me, I communicated to him my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
by ſtaying, which were only to be near
the Divine <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> and to have the Happineſs
of ſometimes ſeeing her, when ſhe went
abroad.</p>
               <p>This Man entering into my Meaning, aſſured
me, he would faithfully keep my Secret; and
that he would not fail to bring me Intelligence
of all that paſſed in the Palace of <hi>Marcomire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could with Difficulty keep myſelf from
falling at his Feet, to expreſs my Senſe of his
kind and generous Offers; but I contented
myſelf with preſenting him another Sum of
Money, larger than the firſt, and aſſured him
of my future Gratitude.</p>
               <p>He then took Leave, and left me to my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
which were wholly upon the Image
of the Divine <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> and the Happineſs of
being ſo near the Object I adored.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0005700702:88"/>
My Confident came to me the next Day;
but brought me no other News, than that my
Eſcape was not yet known to <hi>Marcomire.</hi> I
inquired if he had ſeen <hi>Sydimiris;</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
he had not, and that <hi>Urinoe</hi> had only
aſked him, if he had conducted me ſafe out of
Town: To which he had anſwered as we had
agreed, that I had got out ſafe and undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>A Day or two after, he brought me News
more pleaſing; for he told me, that <hi>Sydimiris</hi>
had ſent for him into her Chamber, and aſked
him ſeveral Queſtions concerning me: That
ſhe appeared very melancholy, and even bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whenever ſhe mentioned my Name.</p>
               <p>This Account gave ſufficient Matter for my
Thoughts to work upon for ſeveral Days. I
interpreted <hi>Sydimiris</hi>'s Bluſh a Thouſand differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Ways; I reflected upon all the different
Cauſes to which it might be owing, and buſied
myſelf with all thoſe innumerable Conjectures,
which, as you know, Madam, ſuch an Incident
always gives Riſe to in a Lover's Imagination.
At length I explained it to my own Advantage,
and felt thereby a conſiderable Increaſe of my
Affection.</p>
               <p>A whole Week having elapſed, without
another Sight of my Confidant, I began to be
greatly alarmed; when, on the Eighth Day of
this cruel Suſpenſe, I ſaw him appear; but with
ſo many Marks of Diſturbance in his Face,
that I trembled to hear what he had to acquaint
me with.</p>
               <p>Oh! Sir, ſaid he, as ſoon as his Concern
ſuffered him to ſpeak, <hi>Marcomire</hi> has diſcovered
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0005700702:89"/>
your Eſcape, and the Means by which it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured:
One of thoſe in whom <hi>Urinoe</hi> confided,
has betrayed it to him; and the beauteous <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimiris</hi>
is likely to feel the moſt terrible Effects
of his Diſpleaſure: He has confined her to her
Chamber, and vows to ſacrifice her Life to the
Honour of his Family; which he ſays, ſhe
has ſtained; and he loads that admirable Lady
with ſo many Reproaches, that it is thought,
her Grief for ſuch undeſerved Calumnies will
occaſion her Death.</p>
               <p>Scarce had he finiſhed theſe cruel Words,
when I, who all the time he had been ſpeaking,
beheld him with a dying Eye, ſunk down at
his Feet in a Swoon; which continued ſo long,
that he began to think me quite dead: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I at laſt opened my Eyes; but it was only
to pour forth a River of Tears, and to utter
Complaints, which might have moved the moſt
obdurate Heart.</p>
               <p>After having a long time tormented myſelf
in weeping and complaining, I at laſt took a
Reſolution, which afforded me ſome Alleviation
of my Grief; and the faithful <hi>Toxares,</hi> ſeeing
me a little compoſed, left me to myſelf, with
a Promiſe to return ſoon, and acquaint me with
what paſſed further in the Palace of <hi>Marcomire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was gone, I roſe from my Bed;
and, dreſſing myſelf in thoſe Cloaths I wore
when I was taken Priſoner, I went to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of <hi>Marcomire;</hi> and, demanding to ſee him,
I was told he was in the Apartment of <hi>Sydimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
and, at my earneſt Deſire, they conducted
me thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0005700702:90"/>
When I entered the Room, I beheld that
incomparable Beauty ſtretched upon a Couch,
diſſolved in Tears; and <hi>Urinoe</hi> upon her Knees,
before her, accompanying with her own, thoſe
precious Drops which fell from the bright Eyes
of her Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcomire,</hi> who was walking furiouſly about
the Room, exclaiming with the utmoſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
againſt that fair Sufferer, did not obſerve
my Entrance; ſo that I had an Opportunity of
going towards <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> who, lifting up her
Eyes to look upon me, gave a loud Shriek;
and, by a Look of extreme Anguiſh, let me
underſtand, how great her Apprehenſions were
upon my Account.</p>
               <p>I am come, Madam, ſaid I, to perform
Part of the Promiſe I made you, and by dying,
to prove your Innocence; and, freeing you from
the Reproaches you ſuffer on my Account, I
ſhall have the Happineſs to convince you, that
my Life is infinitely leſs dear to me, than your
Tranquillity. <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> who hearkened to
me with great Emotion, was going to make
ſome Anſwer, when <hi>Marcomire,</hi> alarmed by
his Siſter's Shriek, came towards us, and, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me at firſt with Aſtoniſhment, and then
with a Smile of Cruelty and Revenge,</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, ſaid he, that I behold my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
Murderer again in my Power?</p>
               <p>I am in thy Power, ſaid I, becauſe I am
willing to be ſo; and came voluntarily to put
myſelf into your Hands, to free that excellent
Lady from the Imputation you have laid on her:
Know, <hi>Marcomire,</hi> that it is to myſelf alone
I owed my Liberty, which I would ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0005700702:91"/>
againſt all the Forces thou couldſt bring to
deprive me of it; and this Sword, which left
thee Life enough to threaten mine, would haply
once more put yours in Danger, were I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by a powerful Conſideration, which
leaves me not the Liberty of even wiſhing you
ill.</p>
               <p>Ah! Diſſembler, ſaid <hi>Marcomire,</hi> in a Rage,
think not to impoſe upon me by thy counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
Mildneſs: Thou art my Priſoner once
more, and I ſhall take care to prevent your
eſcaping a Second time.</p>
               <p>I am not your Priſoner, replied I, while I
poſſeſs this Sword, which has already defended
me againſt greater Numbers than you have here
to oppoſe me; but, continued I, throwing down
my Sword at <hi>Sydimiris</hi>'s Feet, I reſign my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to reſtore that Lady to your good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and to free her from thoſe baſe Aſperſions
thou haſt unjuſtly loaded her with, upon my
Account.</p>
               <p>It matters not, ſaid the brutal Brother, taking
up my Sword, whether thou haſt reſigned, or
I have deprived thee of Liberty; but ſince thou
art in my Power, thou ſhall feel all the Effects
of my Reſentment: Take him away, purſued
he to ſome of his People; put him into the worſt
Dungeon you can find; and let him be guarded
carefully, upon Pain of Death, if he again
eſcapes.</p>
               <p>With theſe Words, ſeveral Men offered to
lead me out of the Room; but I repulſed them
with Diſdain; and, making a low Reverence to
<hi>Sydimiris,</hi> whoſe Countenance expreſſed the
Extremes of Fear and Anguiſh, I followed my
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0005700702:92"/>
Conductors to the Priſon allotted for me; which,
hideous as it was, I contemplated with a ſecret
Pleaſure, ſince I had by that Action, which
had brought me into it, given a Teſtimony of
my Love for the adorable <hi>Sydimiris.</hi>

                     <p>IT is not enough to tell you, that the Method

               <p>This Letter, Madam, purſued Sir <hi>George,</hi>
being wholly calculated to make me hope
that I was not hated by the Divine <hi>Sydimiris;</hi>
and that ſhe meditated ſomething in my Favour;
I reſigned myſelf up to the moſt delightful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>
               <p>What! cried I, tranſported with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of my Joy: Does the moſt admirable <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimiris</hi>
condeſcend to aſſure me, that I have
touched her Heart? And does ſhe promiſe
me, that I ſhall receive ſome convincing Proof
of her Acknowlegement?</p>
               <p>Ah! too happy, and too fortunate <hi>Bellmour,</hi> to
what a glorious Deſtiny haſt thou been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved!
And how oughteſt thou to adore theſe
Fetters, that have procured thee the Eſteem
of the Divine <hi>Sydimiris!</hi>—</p>
               <p>Such, Madam, were the Apprehenſions,
which the Billet I had received inſpired me
with. I continually flattered myſelf with the
moſt pleaſing Hopes; and during Three Weeks
longer, in which I heard no more from <hi>Sydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miris,</hi>
my Imagination, was wholly filled with
thoſe ſweet Thoughts, which her Letter had
made me entertain.</p>
               <p>At length, on the Evening of a Day which
I had wholly ſpent in reading over <hi>Sydimiris</hi>'s
Letter; and interpreting the Senſe of it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
different Ways, but all agreeable to my
ardent Wiſhes; I ſaw the ſage <hi>Urinoe</hi> enter my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0005700702:94"/>
Priſon, accompanied by <hi>Toxares,</hi> whom I had
not ſeen during my laſt Confinement. Wholly
tranſported at the Sight of theſe Two Friends,
and not doubting but they had brought me the
moſt agreeable News, I ran towards them; and,
throwing my ſelf at <hi>Urinoe</hi>'s Feet, I begged her,
in an Ecſtacy of Joy, to acquaint me with <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimiris</hi>'s
Commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urinoe,</hi> in ſome Confuſion at this Action,
intreated me to riſe. 'Tis fit, cried I, in a
Tranſport I could not maſter, that in this
Poſture I ſhould receive the Knowlege of that
Felicity <hi>Sydimiris</hi> has had the Goodneſs to
promiſe me. <hi>Urinoe</hi> ſighed at theſe Words;
and, beholding me with a Look of Compaſſion
and Tenderneſs,</p>
               <p>Would to God, ſaid ſhe, that all I have to
ſay, were as agreeable, as the firſt News I have
to tell you; which is, that you are free, and at
Liberty to leave the Town this Moment! <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimiris,</hi>
continued ſhe, has bought your Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
at the Expence of her own; and, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
you from her Brother's Chains, ſhe has
put on others, haply more cruel than thoſe
you have worn: In fine, ſhe has married a Man,
whom ſhe deteſted, to procure your Liberty;
her Brother having granted it to her upon that
Condition alone.</p>
               <p>Scarce had <hi>Urinoe</hi> finiſhed theſe Words, when
I fell, without Senſe or Motion, at her Feet.
<hi>Toxares</hi> and ſhe, who had foreſeen what might
happen, having provided themſelves with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
neceſſary to reſtore me, brought me to
myſelf with infinite Trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0005700702:95"/>
Cruel! ſaid I to them, with a Tone and
Look, which witneſſed the Exceſs of my
Deſpair, Why have you hindered me from
dying, at once to prevent the thouſand Deaths
I ſhall ſuffer from my Grief? Is this the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of thoſe glorious Hopes <hi>Sydimiris</hi> had
permitted me to entertain? Is this that Proof
of the Acknowlegements I was to expect? And
is it by throwing herſelf into the Arms of my
Rival, that ſhe repays thoſe Obligations ſhe
thinks ſhe owes me?</p>
               <p>Ah! inhuman <hi>Sydimiris!</hi> was it to make
my Deſpair more poignant, that thou flattereſt
me with ſuch a Proſpect of Happineſs? And
was it neceſſary, to the Grandeur of thy Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
that my Life ſhould be the Sacrifice?</p>
               <p>But, how unjuſt am I, cried I, repenting in
an Inſtant of thoſe injurious Suſpicions; How
unjuſt am I, to accuſe the Divine <hi>Sydimiris</hi> of
Inhumanity? Was it not to give me Freedom,
that ſhe beſtowed herſelf upon a Man ſhe
hates? And has ſhe not made herſelf miſerable
for ever, to procure me a fanſied Happineſs?</p>
               <p>Ah! if it be ſo, what a Wretch am I? I,
who have been the only Cauſe of that Miſery,
to which ſhe has doomed herſelf? Ah! Liberty!
purſued I, how I deteſt thee, ſince purchaſed
by the Misfortune of <hi>Sydimiris!</hi> And how far
more ſweet and glorious were thoſe Chains,
which I wore for her ſake!</p>
               <p>My Sighs and Tears leaving me no longer
the Power of Speech, I ſunk down on my Bed,
oppreſs'd with a mortal Grief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urinoe</hi> and <hi>Toxares</hi> drew near to comfort me,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0005700702:96"/>
and ſaid all that ſenſible and diſcreet Perſons
could think of to alleviate my Deſpair.</p>
               <p>Though I have heard that <hi>Sydimiris</hi> is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
replied I, without dying immediately;
yet do not imagine, that I will ſuffer this odious
Life to continue long. If Sorrow do not quickly
diſpatch me, I will ſeek Death by other Means;
for ſince <hi>Sydimiris</hi> is loſt, I have no more Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the World.</p>
               <p>The charitable <hi>Urinoe</hi> and <hi>Toxares</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
in vain to divert me from this ſad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
when <hi>Urinoe,</hi> finding all their Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
ineffectual, drew a Letter out of her Pocket,
and, preſenting it to me, I had Orders, ſaid
ſhe, not to let this Letter be delivered to you,
till you had left the Town; but the Deſpair,
to which I ſee you reduced, does, I conceive,
diſpenſe with my rigorous Obſervation of thoſe
Directions.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Urinoe</hi> was ſpeaking, I opened this
Letter trembling, and found it as follows.</p>

obſtinately, telling me, <hi>Sydimiris</hi> would neither
conſent to the one nor the other, that I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be contented with the Promiſe ſhe made
me, to repreſent my Affliction in a true Light
to her Miſtreſs; and to aſſure her, that nothing
but her abſolute Commands could have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
me from dying. Then, taking leave of
me with much Tenderneſs, ſhe went out of
tbe Priſon, leaving <hi>Toxares</hi> with me, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
me to dreſs, and conducted me out of
that miſerable Place, where I had paſſed ſo many
ſad, and alſo joyful Hours. At a Gate to which
he brought me, I found a Horſe waiting; and,
having embraced this faithful Confidant, with
many Expreſſions of Gratitude, I beſtowed a
Ring of ſome Value upon him to remember me
by; and, mounting my Horſe, with a breaking
Heart, I took the firſt Road which preſented
itſelf to my Eyes, and galloped away, without
knowing whither I went. I rode the whole
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0005700702:99"/>
Night, ſo totally engroſſed by my Deſpair, that
I did not perceive my Horſe was ſo tired, it
could hardly carry me a Step farther: At laſt
the poor Beaſt fell down under me, ſo that I
was obliged to diſmount; and, looking about
me, perceived I was in a Foreſt, without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the leaſt Appearance of any Habitation.</p>
               <p>The Wilderneſs, and Solitude of the Place,
flattered my Deſpair, and while my Horſe was
feeding upon what Graſs he could find, I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
about: The Morning juſt breaking, gave
me Light enough to direct my Steps. Chance
at laſt conducted me to a Cave, which ſeemed
to have been the Reſidence of ſome Hermit, or
unfortunate Lover like myſelf. It was dug at
the Side of a Rock, the Entrance to it thick
ſet with Buſhes, which hid it from View. I
deſcended by a few Steps cut rudely enough,
and was convinced, it had formerly ſerved for
a Habitation for ſome religious or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Perſon; for there were Seats of Turf
raiſed on each Side of it, a kind of Bed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of dried Leaves and Ruſhes, and a Hole
made artificially at the Top, to admit the Light.</p>
               <p>While I conſidered this Place attentively,
I all at once took up a Reſolution, inſpired by
my Deſpair; which was, to continue there,
and indulge my Melancholy in a Retirement
ſo fitted for my Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Giving my Horſe therefore Liberty to go
where he pleaſed, and hanging up my Arms
upon a Tree near my Cave, I took Poſſeſſion
of this ſolitary Manſion, with a gloomy Kind
of Satisfaction, and devoted all my Hours to
the Contemplation of my Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0005700702:100"/>
I lived in this manner, Madam, for Ten
Months, without feeling the leaſt Deſire to
change my Habitation; and, during all that
time, no Mortal approached my Solitude, ſo
that I lived perfectly ſecure and undiſcovered.</p>

aſk, If you eat in all this Time?</p>
               <p>Alas! Sir, replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> Sighs and Tears
were all my Suſtenance.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> and Miſs, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at this Anſwer, <hi>Arabella</hi> ſeemed greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed:</p>
               <p>It is not to be imagined, ſaid ſhe, that Sir
<hi>George;</hi> or, to ſay better, Prince <hi>Viridmore,</hi> lived
Ten Months without eating any thing to ſupport
Nature; but ſuch trifling Circumſtances are
always left out, in the Relations of Hiſtories;
and truly an Audience muſt be very dull and
unapprehenſive, that cannot conceive, without
being told, that a Man muſt neceſſarily eat in
the Space of Ten Months.</p>
               <p>But the Food Sir <hi>George</hi> lived on, replied
the Baronet, was very unſubſtantial, and would
not afford him much Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0005700702:101"/>
I ſuppoſe, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> he lived upon
ſuch Proviſions as the Foreſt afforded him; ſuch as
wild Fruits, Herbs, bitter Sallads, and the
like; which, conſidering the Melancholy that
poſſeſſed him, would appear a voluptuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt;
and which the unfortunate <hi>Orontes,</hi>
when he was in the ſame Situation, thought
infinitely too good for him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> finding <hi>Arabella</hi> took no Notice
of the Hiſtorian's Hyperbole of living upon his
Sighs and Tears, paſſed it over, for fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
her; and Sir <hi>George,</hi> who had been in
ſome Anxiety how to bring himſelf off, when
he perceived <hi>Arabella</hi> was reaſonable enough
to ſuppoſe he muſt have eat during his Abode
in the Foreſt, went on with his Relation in
this Manner.</p>
               <p>I lived, as I before obſerved to you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
in this Cave for Ten Months; and truly
I was ſo reconciled to that ſolitary way of Life,
and found ſo much Sweetneſs in it, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
I ſhould have remained there till this
Day, but for the Adventure which I am going
to recount.</p>
               <p>It being my Cuſtom to walk out every Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Foreſt; returning to my Cave,
ſomething later then uſual, I heard the Cries
of a Woman at ſome Diſtance, who ſeemed to
be in Diſtreſs: I ſtopped to liſten from what
Side thoſe Cries proceeded; and perceiving
they ſeemed to approach nearer to me, I took
down my Armour from the Tree where I had
hung it; and haſtily arming myſelf, ſhaped my
Courſe towards the Place from whence thoſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0005700702:102"/>
Complaints ſeemed to come, reſolving to aſſiſt
that unknown Perſon with all the Strength
that was left me.</p>
               <p>Having gone ſome Paces, I ſpied through
the Branches of the Trees a Man on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
with a Lady, who ſtruggled to get looſe,
and at times calling aloud for Succour.</p>
               <p>This Sight inflaming me with Rage againſt
that impious Raviſher; I flew towards him:
And when I came within hearing;</p>
               <p>Hold, Wretch! cried I, and ceaſe to offer
Violence to that Lady, whom thou beareſt
away by Force; or prepare to defend thyſelf
againſt one, who will die, before he will ſuffer
thee to proſecute thy unjuſt Deſigns.</p>
               <p>The Man, without anſwering me, clapped
Spurs to his Horſe; and it would have been
impoſſible to have overtaken him, had not my
own Horſe, which had never quitted the Foreſt,
appeared in my View: I quickly mounted him,
and followed the Track the Raviſher had taken,
with ſuch Speed, that I came up with him in a
Moment.</p>
               <p>Caitiff! ſaid I, releaſe the Lady, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
thyſelf. Theſe Words, which I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a thundering Blow upon his
Head-piece, obliged him to ſet down the Lady,
who implored Heaven, with the utmoſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
to grant me the Victory: And, recoiling
back a few Paces, to take a View of me,</p>
               <p>I know not, ſaid he, for what Reaſon thou
ſetteſt thyſelf to oppoſe my Deſigns; but I
well know, that thou ſhalt dearly repent of thy
Temerity.</p>
               <p>Saying this, he advanced furiouſly towards
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0005700702:103"/>
me, and aimed ſo heavy a Blow at my Head,
that, had I not received it on my Shield, I
might haply have no longer been in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to defend the diſtreſſed Lady: But, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with the greateſt Dexterity imaginable,
avoided this Blow, I made at him with ſo
much Fierceneſs, and directed my Aims ſo
well, that in a few Moments I wounded him
in ſeveral Places; and his Arms were all dyed
with his Blood.</p>
               <p>This good Succeſs redoubled my Vigour;
and having, by a lucky Stroke with my Sword,
cut the Strings of his Head-piece, it fell off:
And his Head being bare, I was going to let
fall a dreadful Blow upon it, which doubtleſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
would have ſhivered it in a thouſand Pieces,
when he cried out for Quarter, and, letting fall
his Sword, by that Action aſſured me my Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
was intire.</p>
               <p>Live Wretch, cried I, ſince thou art baſe
enough to value Life after being vanquiſhed;
but ſwear upon my Sword, that thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more attempt the Liberty of that Lady.</p>
               <p>While I was ſpeaking, I perceived he was
no longer able to ſit his Horſe: But, ſtaggering
a Moment, he fell off, and lay extended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Motion upon the Ground. Touched with
Compaſſion at this Sight, I alighted, and, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
him to be in a Swoon, was preparing to
give him ſome Aſſiſtance; but, upon my nearer
Approach, I found he was quite dead.</p>
               <p>Leaving therefore this mournful Object, I
I turned about, with an Intention to go and
offer the diſtreſſed Lady my further Help; but
I perceived her already at my Feet.</p>

you have procured me from that baſe
Man; ſince to your admirable Valour I owe
not only the Preſervation of my Life; but,
what is infinitely dearer to me, my Honour.</p>
               <p>The Aſtoniſhment, wherewith I beheld the
miraculous Beauty that appeared before me,
kept me a Moment in ſuch an attentive Gaze,
that I forgot ſhe was at my Feet: Recollecting
myſelf, however, with ſome Confuſion at my
Neglect,</p>
               <p>Oh! riſe, Madam, cried I, helping her up

               <p>That you may the better conceive the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration

produced in my Soul, I will endeavour, to
give you a Deſcription of her Beauty, which
was altogether miraculous.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE new-fallen Snow, purſued Sir <hi>George,</hi>
was tanned, in Compariſon of the refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Purity of that White which made up the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0005700702:105"/>
Ground of her Complexion; and, though Fear
had a little gathered the Carnations of her
Cheeks, yet her Joy at being delivered
ſeemed to plant them there with ſuch freſh
Advantages, that my Eye might ſhrink at the
Brightneſs of that mingled Luſtre: Her Mouth,
as well for Shape as Colour, might ſhame the
Imitation of the beſt Pencils, and the livelieſt
Tints; and though through ſome petty Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of Joy, it wanted the Smiles, which Grief
and Terror ſequeſtred, yet ſhe never opened it,
but like the Eaſt, at the Birth of a beautiful
Day, and then diſcovered Treaſures, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
Whiteneſs made the Price ineſtimable:
All the Features of her Face had ſo near a
Kindred to Proportion and Symmetry, as the
ſeveral Maſters of <hi>Apelles</hi>'s Art might have
called it his Glory to have copied Beauties from
her, as the beſt of Models: The Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of her Viſage ſhewed the Extremes of
an imperfect Circle, and almoſt formed it to a
perfect Oval: And this Abridgment of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
was tapered by a Pair of the brighteſt
Stars, that ever were lighted up by the Hand
of Nature: As their Colour was the ſame with
the Heavens, there was a ſpherical Harmony
in their Motion; and that mingled with a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity
ſo penetrating, as neither the firmeſt
Eye, nor the ſtrongeſt Soul, could arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with a Reſiſtance of Proof againſt thoſe
pointed Glories: Her Head was crowned with
a prodigious Quantity of fair long Hair, which
Colour as fitly ſuited the Beauty of her Eyes,
as Imagination could make it: To theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
of Face were joined the reſt of her Neck,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0005700702:106"/>
Hands, and Shape; and there ſeemed a Conteſt
between the Form and Whiteneſs of the two
former, which had the largeſt Commiſſion from
Nature to work Wonders.</p>
               <p>In fine, her Beauty was miraculous, and
could not fail of producing a ſudden Effect
upon a Heart like mine.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed in an Inſtant from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt
Admiration, to ſomething yet more
tender, I reiterated my Offers of Service to
the fair Unknown; who told me, ſhe feared her
Father had Occaſion for ſome Aſſiſtance, her
Raviſher having left his Men to engage him, and
keep off his Purſuit, while he rode off with
his Prize: Hereupon I begg'd her to direct me
to the Place where ſhe left her Father, aſſuring
her I would gladly venture my Life a Second
time, to preſerve his; and ſhe deſiring to go
with me, I placed her before me on my Horſe,
and had the exquiſite Pleaſure of ſupporting
with my Arms the faireſt and moſt admirable
Creature in the World.</p>
               <p>In leſs than half an Hour, which had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to me but a Moment, we got to the
Place where ſhe had been torn from her Father;
whom we beheld with three of his Servants,
maintaining a Fight againſt twice as many of
their Enemies.</p>
               <p>Having gently ſet down the beauteous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
upon the Graſs, I flew to the Relief
of her Father; and, throwing myſelf furiouſly
amongſt his Aſſailants, diſpatched two of them
with ſo many Blows: The others, ſeeing ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
an Aſſiſtance, gave back a little; and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0005700702:107"/>
I took Advantage of their Conſternation, to
redouble my Blows, and brought Two more
of them at my Feet.</p>
               <p>There remained now but Four to overcome;
and my Arrival having given new Vigour to
thoſe whoſe Part I had taken, they ſeconded
me ſo well, that we ſoon had nothing more left
to do; for the reſt, ſeeing their Comrades ſlain,
ſought their Safety in Flight: We were too
generous to purſue them, the Blood of ſuch
Wretches being unworthy to be ſhed by our
Swords.</p>
               <p>The fair Unknown, ſeeing us Conquerors,
flew to embrace her Father; who, holding her
preſſed between his Arms, turned his Eyes upon
me; then quitting her, came towards me, and,
in the moſt obliging Terms imaginable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
me Thanks for the Aſſiſtance I had
brought him; and being informed by his
Daughter, of what I had done for her Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
this old Gentleman renewed his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegements,
calling me the Preſerver of
his Life, the valiant Defender of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
Honour, his tutelary Angel, and the
Guardian of his Houſe.</p>
               <p>In fine, he loaded me with ſo many Thanks
and Praiſes, that I could not chooſe but be in
ſome Confuſion; and, to put an End to them, I
begged he would inform me, by what means
he came into that Misfortune.</p>
               <p>He told me, that, reſiding in a Caſtle at the
Extremity of this Foreſt, the Charms of his
Daughter had captivated a neighbouring Lord,
whoſe Character and Perſon being diſagreeable
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0005700702:108"/>
both to her and himſelf, he had abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to give her to him: Thereupon he had ſet
upon them as they were going to viſit a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at ſome Diſtance, and, dragging <hi>Philonice</hi>
out of the Coach, put her before him on his
Horſe, and carried her away, leaving Eight of
his Men to engage him, and his Servants; who,
being but Four in Number, muſt inevitably
have periſhed, had I not come to his Relief,
and, by my miraculous Valour, vanquiſhed all
his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Saying this, he deſired me to go home with
him to the Caſtle; and having led his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Coach, inſiſted upon my placing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
next her; and, getting in himſelf, ordered
them to return home.</p>
               <p>This Accident having altered his Deſign of
making the Viſit which had been the Occaſion
of his Journey;</p>
               <p>The Baron, for that I found was his Title,
entertained me, all the Way, with repeated Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Acknowledgements and Tenderneſs;
and the incomparable <hi>Philonice</hi> condeſcended
alſo to aſſure me of her Gratitude for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I had done her.</p>
               <p>At our Arrival at the Caſtle, I perceived it
was very large and magnificent: The Baron con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
me to one of the beſt Apartments, and
would ſtay in the Room till my Armour was
taken off, that he might be aſſured I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no Hurts: Having rendered him the like
Civility in his own Chamber, and ſatisfied
myſelf he was not wounded, we returned to
the beautiful <hi>Philonice;</hi> and this ſecond Sight
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0005700702:109"/>
having finiſhed my Defeat, I remained ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
her Slave, that neither <hi>Dorothea</hi> nor
<hi>Sydimiris</hi> were more paſſionately beloved.</p>
               <p>At the earneſt Intreaty of the Baron, I ſtaid
ſome Weeks in the Caſtle; during which, the
daily Sight of <hi>Philonice</hi> ſo augmented my
Flames, that I was no longer in a Condition to
conceal them; but, fearing to diſpleaſe that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Beauty by a Confeſſion of my Paſſion, I
languiſhed in ſecret; and the Conſtraint I laid
upon myſelf, gave me ſuch Torments, that I
fell into a profound Melancholy, and looked
ſo pale and dejected, that the Baron was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Alteration, and conjured me in the
moſt preſſing Terms, to acquaint him with the
Cauſe of my Uneaſineſs: But though I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
obſtinately ſilent with my Tongue, yet
my Eyes ſpoke intelligibly enough; and the
Bluſhes which appeared in the fair Cheeks
of <hi>Philonice,</hi> whenever ſhe ſpoke to me on the
Subject of my Grief, convinced me ſhe was
not ignorant of my Paſſion.</p>
               <p>At length the Agitation of my Mind throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me into a Fever, the Baron, who was firmly
perſuaded, that my Illneſs proceeded from ſome
concealed Vexation, preſſed me continually to
declare myſelf; and, finding all his Intreaties
ineffectual, he commanded his Daughter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to find out the Cauſe of that Grief
which had put me into ſuch a Condition.</p>
               <p>For that Purpoſe therefore, having brought
the fair <hi>Philonice</hi> into my Chamber, he ſtaid a
few Minutes, and, leaving the Room, under
Pretence of Buſineſs, <hi>Philonice</hi> remained alone
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0005700702:110"/>
by my Bedſide, her Women, out of Reſpect,
ſtaying at the other End of the Chamber.</p>
               <p>This Divine Perſon, ſeeing herſelf alone with
me, and remembring her Father's Command,
bluſhed, and caſt down her Eyes in ſuch appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Confuſion, that I could not help obſerving
it: And, interpreting it to the Diſpleaſure ſhe
took in being ſo near me,</p>
               <p>Whatever Joy I take in the Honour your
Viſit does me, Madam, ſaid I, in a weak Voice;
yet ſince nothing is ſo dear to me, as your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
I would rather diſpenſe with this
Mark of your Goodneſs to an unfortunate
Wretch, then ſee you in the leaſt Conſtraint.</p>
               <p>And why, replied ſhe, with a Tone full of
Sweetneſs, do you ſuppoſe that I am here by
Conſtraint, when it would be more juſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that in viſiting the valiant Defender of
my Honour, and the Life of my Father, I only
follow my own Inclinations?</p>
               <p>Ah! Madam, ſaid I, tranſported with Joy
at ſo favourable a Speech, the little Service I
had the Happineſs to do you, does not merit
ſo infinite a Favour; and tho' I had loſt the beſt
Part of my Blood in your Defence, I ſhould
have been well rewarded with your Safety.</p>
               <p>Since you do not repent of what you have
done, replied ſhe, I am willing to be obliged
to you for another Favour; and aſk it with the
greater Hope of obtaining it, as I muſt acquaint
you, it is by my Father's Command I take
that Liberty, who is much intereſted in my
Succeſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0005700702:111"/>
There is no Occaſion, Madam, returned I,
to make uſe of any Intereſt but your own, to
engage me to obey you, ſince that is, and ever
will be, all-powerful with me: Speak then,
Madam, and let me know what it is you deſire
of me, that I may, once in my Life, have the
Glory of obeying you.</p>
               <p>It is, ſaid ſhe, bluſhing ſtill more than before,
that you will acquaint us with the Cauſe of that
Melancholy, which has, as we imagine, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
your preſent Illneſs.</p>
               <p>At theſe Words I trembled, turned pale; and,
not daring to diſcover the true Cauſe of my
Affliction, I remained in a profound Silence.</p>
               <p>I ſee, ſaid the beautiful <hi>Philonice,</hi> that you
have no Inclination to obey me; and ſince my
Requeſt has, as I perceive, given you ſome
Diſturbance, I will prevail upon my Father to
preſs you no farther upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>No, Madam, ſaid I, eagerly; the Baron ſhall
be ſatisfied, and you ſhall be obeyed; though,
after the Knowlege of my Crime, you doom
me to that Death I ſo juſtly merit.</p>
               <p>Yes Madam, this unfortunate Man, who has

little Service he did you, has cancelled the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of that Service by daring to adore you.</p>
               <p>I love you, divine <hi>Philonice;</hi> and, not being
able either to repent, or ceaſe to be guilty of
loving you, I am reſolved to die, and ſpare
you the Trouble of pronouncing my Sentence.
I beſeech you therefore to believe, that I would
have died in Silence, but for your Command
to declare myſelf, and you ſhould never have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0005700702:112"/>
known the Exceſs of my Love and Deſpair,
had not my Obedience to your Will obliged
me to confeſs it.</p>
               <p>I finiſhed theſe Words with ſo much Fear
and Confuſion, that I durſt not lift my Eyes
up to the fair Face of <hi>Philonice,</hi> to obſerve how
ſhe received this Diſcourſe: I waited therefore,
trembling, for her Anſwer; but finding that in
ſeveral Minutes ſhe ſpoke not a Word, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
at laſt, to caſt a languiſhing Glance upon
the Viſage I adored, and ſaw ſo many Marks
of Diſorder upon it, that I was almoſt dead
with the Apprehenſions of having offended her
beyond even the Hope of procuring her Pardon
by my Death.</p>

                  <p>Wherein Sir George concludes his Hiſtory;

               </argument>
               <p>THE Silence of <hi>Philonice,</hi> continued Sir
<hi>George,</hi> pierced me to the Heart; and
when I ſaw her riſe from her Seat, and prepare
to go away without ſpeaking, Grief took ſuch
Poſſeſſion of my Spirits, that, uttering a Cry, I
fell into a Swoon, which, as I afterwards was
informed, greatly alarmed the beautiful <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi>
who, reſuming her Seat, had the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to aſſiſt her Women in bringing me to
myſelf; and, when I opened my Eyes, I had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0005700702:113"/>
the Satisfaction to behold her ſtill by me, and
all the Signs of Compaſſion in her Face.</p>
               <p>This Sight a little re-aſſuring me; I aſk your
Pardon, Madam, ſaid I, for the Condition in
which I have appeared before you, and alſo for
that I am not yet dead, as is doubtleſs your
Wiſh: But I will make Haſte, purſued I,
ſighing, to fulfil your Deſires; and you ſhall
ſoon be freed from the Sight of a miſerable
Wretch, who, to his laſt Moment, will not
ceaſe to adore you.</p>
               <p>It is not your Death that I deſire, ſaid the
fair <hi>Philonice;</hi> and, after having preſerved both
my Father and me from Death, it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
that we ſhould ſuffer you to die, if we
can help it.</p>
               <p>Live therefore, <hi>Bellmour,</hi> purſued ſhe, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and live, if poſſible, without continuing in
that Weakneſs I cannot chooſe but condemn:
Yet whatever are your Thoughts for the future,
remember that your Death will be a Fault I
cannot reſolve to pardon.</p>
               <p>Speaking theſe Words, without giving me
time to anſwer, ſhe left my Chamber; and I
found ſomething ſo ſweet and favourable in
them, that I reſolved to obey her, and forward
my Cure as much as I was able: However, the
Agitation of Spirits increaſed my Fever ſo
much, that my Life was deſpaired of.</p>
               <p>The Baron hardly ever left my Bedſide.
<hi>Philonice</hi> came every Day to ſee me, and ſeemed
extremely moved at the Danger I was in. One
Day, when I was worſe than uſual, ſhe came
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0005700702:114"/>
cloſe to the Bedſide; and, opening the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</p>
               <p>What <hi>Bellmour,</hi> ſaid ſhe, do you pay ſo
little Obedience to my Commands, that you
reſolve to die?</p>
               <p>Heaven is my Witneſs, Madam, ſaid I,
faintly, that nothing is ſo dear and ſacred to
me as your Commands; and ſince, out of your
ſuperlative Goodneſs, you are pleaſed to have
ſome Care for my Life, I would preſerve it to
obey you, were it in my Power; but, alas!
Madam, I ſtrive in vain to repel the Violence
of my Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>In a few Days more, I was reduced to the
laſt Extremity: It was then that the fair <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonice</hi>
diſcovered, that ſhe did not hate me; for
ſhe made no Scruple to weep before me; and
thoſe Tears ſhe ſo liberally ſhed, had ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
an Effect upon my Mind, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
I felt, communicated itſelf to my
Body, and gave ſuch a Turn to my Diſtemper,
that my Recovery was not only hoped, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>The Baron expreſſed his Satisfaction at this
Alteration, by the moſt affectionate Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and though the fair <hi>Philonice</hi> ſaid very
little, yet I perceived by the Joy that appeared
in her fair Eyes, that ſhe was not leſs intereſted
in my Recovery, than her Father.</p>
               <p>The Phyſicians having declared me out of
Danger, the Baron, who had taken his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
long before, came one Day into my
Chamber; and ordering thoſe who attended me,
to leave us alone,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0005700702:115"/>
Prince, ſaid he, for in recounting my Hiſtory
to him, I had diſcloſed my true Quality, I am
not ignorant of that Affection you bear my
Daughter; and am ſenſible it has occaſioned
the Extremity to which we have ſeen you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:
Had you been pleaſed to acquaint me
with your Sentiments, you would have avoided
thoſe Diſpleaſures you have ſuffered; for though
your Birth were not ſo illuſtrious as it is, yet,
preferring Virtue to all other Advantages, I
ſhould have eſteemed my Daughter honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by your Love, and have freely beſtowed
her on you: But ſince to thoſe rare Qualities
wherewith Heaven has ſo liberally endowed
you, you add alſo that of a Birth ſo noble,
doubt not but I ſhall think myſelf highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by your Alliance: If therefore your
Thoughts of my Daughter be not changed,
and you eſteem her worthy to be your Bride, I
here ſolemnly promiſe you to beſtow her upon
you, as ſoon as you are perfectly recovered.</p>
               <p>I leave you to gueſs, Madam, the Joy which
I felt at this Diſcourſe: It was ſo great, that
it would not permit me to thank him, as I
ſhould have done, for the ineſtimable Bleſſing
he beſtowed on me.</p>
               <p>I ſaw <hi>Philonice</hi> a few Minutes after; and, being
commanded by her Father to give me her Hand,
ſhe did ſo, without any Marks of Reluctance,
and, having reſpectfully kiſſed it, I vowed to be
her Slave for ever.</p>
               <p>Who would have imagined, continued Sir
<hi>George,</hi> with a profound Sigh, that Fortune,
while ſhe thus ſeemed to flatter me, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to make me ſuffer the ſevereſt Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0005700702:116"/>
I began now to leave my Bed, and was
able to walk about my Chamber. The Baron
was making great Preparations for our Nuptials;
when one Night I was alarmed with the Cries
of <hi>Philonice</hi>'s Women; and, a few Moments
after, the Baron came into my Chamber, with
a diſtracted Air.</p>
               <p>O! Son, cried he, for ſo he always called
me, now <hi>Philonice</hi> is loſt both to you and me:
She is carried off by Force, and I am preparing
to follow and reſcue her, if poſſible; but I fear
my Endeavours will be fruitleſs, ſince I know
not which Way her Raviſhers have taken.</p>
               <p>Oh! Sir, cried I, tranſported both with Grief
and Rage, you ſhall not go alone: Her Reſcue
belongs to me; and I will effect it, or periſh in
the Attempt.</p>
               <p>The Baron, having earneſtly conjured me
not to expoſe myſelf to the Danger of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe,
by ſo imprudent a Reſolution, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to quit me, Word being brought him, that
his Horſe was ready: And as ſoon as he was
gone out of the Room, in ſpite of all that could
be ſaid to prevent me, by my Attendants, I
made them put on my Armour; and, mounting
a Horſe I had cauſed to be made ready, fallied
furiouſly out of the Caſtle, breathing out Vows
of Vengeance againſt the Wretch who had
robbed me of <hi>Philonice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I rode the whole Night without ſtopping.
Day appeared, when I found myſelf near a
ſmall Village. I entered it, and made ſtrict
Enquiry after the Raviſher of <hi>Philonice,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
the fair Creature, and offering vaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to any who could bring me the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0005700702:117"/>
of her: But all was in vain; I could
make no Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>After travelling ſeveral Days, to no Purpoſe,
I returned to the Caſtle, in order to know if
the Baron had been more ſucceſsful in his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
then myſelf; but I found him oppreſſed
with Grief: He had heard no Tidings of his
Daughter, and had ſuffered no ſmall Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
upon my Account. Having aſſured
him I found myſelf very able to travel, I took
an affectionate Leave of him, promiſing him
never to give over my Search, till I had found
the Divine <hi>Philonice:</hi> But Heaven has not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me that Happineſs; and though I have
ſpent ſeveral Years in ſearching for her, I have
never been able to diſcover where ſhe is: Time
has not cured me of my Grief for her Loſs;
and, though by an Effect of my Deſtiny,
another Object poſſeſſes my Soul, yet I do
not ceaſe to deplore her Misfortune, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up Vows for her Happineſs.</p>
               <p>And is this all you have to ſay? ſaid <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
whom the latter Part of his Hiſtory had
extremely ſurpriſed; or are we to expect a
Continuance of your Adventures?</p>
               <p>I have faithfully related all my Adventures,
that are worthy your Hearing, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
Sir <hi>George;</hi> and I flatter myſelf, you
will do me the Juſtice to own, that I have
been rather unfortunate than faithleſs; and that
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> had little Reaſon to tax me with
Inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>In my Opinion, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> ſpoke too favourably of you, when he
called you only inconſtant; and if he had add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0005700702:118"/>
the Epithet of Ungrateful and Unjuſt, he
would have marked your Character better.</p>
               <p>For, in fine, Sir, purſued ſhe, you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perſuade any reaſonable Perſon, that your
being able to loſe the Remembrance of the fair
and generous <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> in your new Paſſion for
<hi>Philonice,</hi> was not an Exceſs of Levity: But
your ſuffering ſo tamely the Loſs of this laſt
Beauty, and allowing her to remain in the
Hands of her Raviſher, while you permit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Affection to take Poſſeſſion of your Soul,
is ſuch an Outrage to all Truth and Conſtancy,
that you deſerve to be ranked among the falſeſt
of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Alas! Madam, replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> who had
not foreſeen the Influence <hi>Arabella</hi> would draw
from this laſt Adventure, What would you
have an unfortunate Man, whoſe Hopes have
been ſo often, and ſo cruelly, diſappointed, do?
I have bewailed the Loſs of <hi>Philonice,</hi> with a
Deluge of Tears; I have taken infinite Pains to
find her, but to no Purpoſe; and when Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
compaſſionating my Sufferings, preſented
to my Eyes, an Object, to whom the whole
World ought to pay Adoration, how could I
reſiſt that powerful Impulſe, which forced me to
love what appeared ſo worthy of my Affection?</p>
               <p>Call not, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> that an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible
Impulſe, which was only the Effect
of thy own changing Humour: The ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
might be pleaded for all the Faults we ſee
committed in the World; and Men would no
longer be anſwerable for their own Crimes.
Had you imitated the illuſtrious Heroes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
as well in the Conſtancy of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0005700702:119"/>
as, it muſt be confeſſed, you have done
in their admirable Valour; you would now be
either ſighing in your Cave for the Loſs of the
generous <hi>Sydimiris,</hi> or wandering through the
World in Search of the beautiful <hi>Philonice.</hi>
Had you perſevered in your Affection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
your Purſuit of that Fair-one; you
would, perhaps, ere this, have found her ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Shade of a Tree in ſome lone Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
as <hi>Philodaſpes</hi> did his admirable <hi>Delia,</hi> or
diſguiſed in a Slave's Habit, as <hi>Ariobarſanes</hi> ſaw
his Divine <hi>Olympia;</hi> or bound haply in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
and have had the Glory of freeing her, as
<hi>Ambriomer</hi> did the beauteous <hi>Agione;</hi> or in a
Ship in the Hands of Pirates, like the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<hi>Eliza;</hi> or—</p>
               <p>Enough, dear Niece, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles;</hi>
you have quoted Examples ſufficient, if this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
Man would have the Grace to follow
them.</p>
               <p>True, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella;</hi> and I would
recommend to his Conſideration the Conduct
of thoſe illuſtrious Perſons I have named, to the
end that, purſuing their Steps, he may arrive
at their Glory and Happineſs, that is the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of being perfectly conſtant, and the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of his Miſtreſs: And be aſſured, Sir, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<hi>Arabella,</hi> looking at Sir <hi>George,</hi> that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
will never reſtore you the Crown of your
Anceſtors, and place you upon the Throne to
which you pretend, while you make yourſelf
unworthy of its Protection, by ſo ſhameful an
Inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>I perhaps ſpeak with too much Freedom to a
great Prince; whom though Fortune has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0005700702:120"/>
of his Dominions, is intitled to a certain
Degree of Reſpect: But I conceive, it belongs
to me, in a particular manner, to reſent the
Baſeneſs of that Crime, to which you are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make me the Excuſe; and, looking upon
myſelf, as diſhonoured by thoſe often proſtituted
Vows you have offered me, I am to tell you,
that I am highly diſobliged; and forbid you to
appear in my Preſence again, till you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
thoſe Thoughts, which are worthy your
noble Extraction; and are capable of treating
me with that Reſpect, that is my Due.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe roſe from he Seat, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very majeſtically out of the Room, leaving
Sir <hi>George</hi> overwhelmed with Shame and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at having conducted the latter Part of his
Narration ſo ill, and drawn upon himſelf a
Sentence, which deprived him of all his Hopes.</p>

Compaſſion upon me, and confeſs, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be more unfortunate, than that
damn'd Slip I made at the latter End of my
Hiſtory: But for that, my Reputation for
Courage and Conſtancy had been as high as
the great <hi>Oroondates,</hi> or <hi>Juba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since you have ſo fertile an Invention, ſaid

Ods-heart! It is pity you are not poor enough

               <p>Oh! Sir, cried Sir <hi>George,</hi> I have Stock

Three thouſand Lines of an Epic Poem; half a

String of Puns, that would ſerve to embelliſh a

               <p>Nay, then, interrupted Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> you

Language, becauſe it reaches to Perfection,
may be called ſtiff, laboured, and pedantic; the
Criticiſms, when they let in more Light than

oſtentatious Glitter; and becauſe thoſe Papers

damn the queer Fellow, for over-propping Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
an excellent new Phraſe! which thoſe who
can find no Meaning in, may accommodate
with one of their own; then give ſhrewd Hints,
that ſome Perſons, though they do not publiſh
their Performances, may have more Merit,
than thoſe that do.</p>
               <p>Upon my Soul, <hi>Charles,</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi>
thou art ſuch an ill-natured Fellow, that I am
afraid, thou wilt be ſneering at me when I am
gone; and wilt endeavour, to perſuade Lady
<hi>Bella,</hi> that not a Syllable of my Story is true.
Speak, purſued he, Wilt thou have the Cruelty
to deprive me of my lawful Claim to the great
Kingdom of <hi>Kent;</hi> and rob me of the Glory
of fighting ſingly againſt Five hundred Men?</p>
               <p>I do not know, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> whether

               <p>You are ſo fitly puniſhed, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
for that ill-judged Adventure you related
laſt, by the bad Opinion Lady <hi>Bella</hi> entertains
of you, that I need not add to your Miſfortune:
And therefore, you ſhall be Prince <hi>Veridomer,</hi> if
you pleaſe; ſince, under that Character, you
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0005700702:123"/>
are obliged not to pretend to any Lady, but
the incomparable <hi>Philonice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> who underſtood his Meaning,
went home, to think of ſome Means, by which
he might draw himſelf out of the Embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he was in; and Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> as he had
promiſed, did not endeavour to undeceive Lady
<hi>Bella,</hi> with regard to the Hiſtory he had feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
being very well ſatisfied with his having
put it out of his Power to make his Addreſſes
to her, ſince ſhe now looked upon him as the
Lover of <hi>Philonice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> he did not penetrate into
the Meaning of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Story; and only
imagined, that by relating ſuch a Heap of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
he had a Deſign to entertain the
Company, and give a Proof of the Felicity of
his Invention; and Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
he had been ridiculing her Couſin's
ſtrange Notions, was better pleaſed with him
than ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> however, was leſs ſatisfied than
any of them: She could not endure to ſee ſo
brave a Knight, who drew his Birth from a
Race of Kings, tarniſh the Glory of his gallant
Actions by ſo baſe a Perfidy.</p>
               <p>Alas! ſaid ſhe to herſelf, How much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
has the beautiful <hi>Philonice</hi> to accuſe me for
all the Anguiſh ſhe ſuffers? ſince I am the
Cauſe, that the ungrateful Prince, on whom
ſhe beſtows her Affections, ſuffers her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
quietly, in the Hands of her Raviſher,
without endeavouring to reſcue her: But, Oh!
too lovely, and unfortunate Fair-one, ſaid ſhe,
as if ſhe had been preſent, and liſtening to her,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0005700702:124"/>
diſtinguiſh, I beſeech you, between thoſe Faults,
which the Will, and thoſe which Neceſſity, makes

Humour, had not preſumed to
come to the Caſtle for ſeveral
Days; but, hearing that they were
preparing to leave the Country,
he wrote a ſhort Billet to her; and in the Style
of Romance, moſt humbly intreated her to
grant him a Moment's Audience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> being informed by <hi>Lucy,</hi> to whom Sir
<hi>George</hi>'s Gentleman had addreſſed himſelf, that
he had brought a Letter from his Maſter, ſhe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0005700702:126"/>
ordered her to bring him to her Apartment, and
as ſoon as he appeared,</p>
               <p>How comes it, ſaid ſhe, that the Prince your
Maſter, has had the Preſumption to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
me again, after my abſolute Commands to
the contrary?</p>
               <p>The Prince, my Maſter, Madam, ſaid the
Man, exceſſively ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>Ay! ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> Are you not Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
'Squire? And does he not truſt you with his
moſt ſecret Thoughts?</p>
               <p>I belong to Sir <hi>George Bellmour,</hi> Madam,
replied the Man, who did not underſtand what
She meant: I have not the Honour to be a
'Squire.</p>
               <p>No! interrupted <hi>Arabella;</hi> 'tis ſtrange then,
that he ſhould have honoured you with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
Pray, what is it you come to requeſt
for him?</p>
               <p>My Maſter, Madam, ſaid he, ordered me
to get this Letter delivered to your Ladyſhip,
and to ſtay for your Commands.</p>
               <p>You would perſuade me, ſaid ſhe, ſternly,
being provoked that he did not deliver the
Letter upon his Knees, as was the Cuſtom in
Romances, that you are not acquainted with
the Purport of this audacious Billet, ſince you
expreſs ſo little Fear of my Diſpleaſure; but
know, preſumptuous, that I am mortally
offended with your Maſter, for his daring to
ſuppoſe I would read this Proof at once of
his Inſolence and Infidelity; and was you worth
my Reſentment, I would haply make you ſuffer
for your Want of Reſpect to me.</p>
               <p>The poor Man, ſurpriſed and confounded at
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0005700702:127"/>
her Anger, and puzzled extremely; to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what ſhe meant, was opening his Mouth
to ſay ſomething, 'tis probable in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
when <hi>Arabella,</hi> preventing him,</p>
               <p>I know what thou wouldſt ſay, ſaid ſhe:
Thou wouldſt abuſe my Patience by a falſe
Detail of thy Maſter's Sighs, Tears, Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
and Deſpair.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, I don't intend to ſay any
ſuch Thing, replied the Man.</p>
               <p>No! repeated <hi>Arabella,</hi> a little diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
Bear back his preſumptuous Billet,
which, I ſuppoſe, contains the melancholy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
and tell him, He that could ſo ſoon
forget the generous <hi>Sydimiris</hi> for <hi>Philonice,</hi> and
could afterwards be falſe to that incomparable
Beauty, is not a Perſon worthy to adore <hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Man, who could not tell what to make
of this Meſſage, and feared he ſhould forget
theſe two hard Names, humbly intreated her
to be pleaſed to acquaint his Maſter, by a Line,
with her Intentions. <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſuppoſing he
meant to importune her ſtill more, made a
Sign with her Hand, very majeſtically, for
him to be gone; but he, not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
her Meaning, ſtood ſtill, with an Air of
Perplexity, not daring to beg her to explain
herſelf; ſuppoſing, ſhe, by that Sign, required
ſomething of him.</p>
               <p>Why doſt thou not obey my Commands?
ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> finding he did not go.</p>
               <p>I will, to be ſure, Madam, replied he;
wiſhing at the ſame time ſecretly, ſhe would
let him know what they were.</p>
               <p>And yet, ſaid ſhe haſtily, thou art diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

rendered him the Deteſtation of all generous
Perſons whatever?</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Meſſenger, extremely ſurpriſed
at ſo harſh a Character of his Maſter, and the
Rage with which the Lady ſeemed to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
made haſte to get out of her Apartment;
and, at his Return, informed his Maſter, very
exactly, of the Reception he had met with,
repeating all Lady <hi>Bella</hi>'s Words; which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Blunders he made in the Names

on the Road.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Day of their Departure being come,
they ſet out in a Coach and Six, attended
by ſeveral Servants on Horſeback. The Firſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0005700702:129"/>
Day's Journey paſſed off, without any Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
worthy relating; but, towards the Cloſe of
the Second, they were alarmed by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of three Highwaymen, well mounted,
at a ſmall Diſtance.</p>
               <p>One of the Servants, who had firſt ſpied
them, immediately rode up to the Coach; and,
for fear of alarming the Ladies, whiſpered Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> in the Ear.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who was ſitting next his Son, and
had heard it, cried out with too little Caution,
How's this? Are we in any Danger of being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked,
ſay you?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> without replying, jumped
out of the Coach; at which Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
ſcreamed out; and, leſt her Father ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
whipped into her Brother's Sear, and held
him faſt by the Coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> being in a ſtrange Conſternation at
all this, put her Head out of the Coach, to ſee
what was the Matter; and, obſerving Three or
Four Men of a genteel Appearance, on Horſe-back,
who ſeemed to halt, and gaze on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
without offering to advance;</p>
               <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe to her Uncle, are they yonder
Knights whom you ſuppoſe will attack us?</p>
               <p>Ay, ay, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> they are Knights
of the Road indeed: I ſuppoſe we ſhall have a
Bout with them; for it will be ſcandalous to
deliver, ſince we have the Odds of our Side,
and are more than a Match for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> interpreting theſe Words in her
own Way, looked out again; and, ſeeing the
Robbers, who had by this time taken their
Reſolution, galloping towards them, her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0005700702:130"/>
and the Servants ranging themſelves of each
Side of the Coach, as if to defend them,</p>
               <p>Hold, hold, valiant Men, ſaid ſhe, as loud
as ſhe could ſpeak, addreſſing herſelf to the
Highwaymen; do not, by a miſtaken Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
hazard your Lives in a Combat, to which
the Laws of Honour do not oblige you: We
are not violently carried away, as you falſly
ſuppoſe; we go willingly along with theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who are our Friends and Relations.</p>
               <p>Hey-day! cried Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> ſtarting at her
with great Surprize; what's the Meaning of all
this? Do you think theſe Fellows will mind your
fine Speeches, Niece?</p>
               <p>I hope they will, Sir, ſaid ſhe: Then, pulling
her Couſin, ſhew yourſelf, for Heaven's Sake,
Miſs, purſued ſhe, and ſecond my Aſſurances,
that we are not forced away: Theſe generous
Men come to fight for our Deliverance.</p>
               <p>The Highwaymen, who were near enough
to hear <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Voice, though they could
not diſtinguiſh her Words, gazed on her with
great Surprize; and, finding they would be very
well received, thought fit to abandon their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
and galloped away as faſt as they were
able. Some of the Servants made a Motion to
purſue them; but Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> forbad it; and,
entering again into the Coach, congratulated
the Ladies upon the Eſcape they had.</p>
               <p>Since theſe Men, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> did not come
to deliver us, out of a miſtaken Notion, that
we were carried away by Force, it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follow, they had ſome bad Deſign; and
I proteſt I know not who to ſuſpect is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, unleſs the Perſon you vanquiſhed,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0005700702:131"/>
ſaid ſhe to Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> the other Day in a
ſingle Combat; for the diſguiſed <hi>Edward,</hi> you
aſſured me, was dead: But perhaps, continued
ſhe, it was ſome Lover of Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s,
who deſigned to make an Attempt to carry her
away: Methinks he was too ſlenderly attended
for ſuch an hazardous Undertaking.</p>
               <p>I'll aſſure you Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
I have no Lovers among Highwaymen.</p>
               <p>Highwaymen! repeated <hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, ay, to be ſure, Madam, rejoined Sir
<hi>Charles:</hi> What do you take them for?</p>
               <p>For Perſons of Quality, Sir, reſumed <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella;</hi>
and though they came queſtionleſs, either
upon a good or bad Deſign, yet it cannot be
doubted, but that their Birth is illuſtrious;
otherwiſe they would never pretend either to
fight in our Defence, or to carry us away.</p>
               <p>I vow, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> I can't poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
underſtand you.</p>
               <p>My Couſin, Sir, interrupted Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
has been miſtaken in theſe Perſons; and has not
yet, poſſibly, believed them to be Highwaymen,
who came to rob us.</p>
               <p>There is no Queſtion, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
ſmiling, that if they did not come to defend
us, they came to rob you: But it is hard to
gueſs, which of us it was of whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to deprive you; for it may very poſſibly
be for my Couſin's fake, as well as mine, that
this Enterprize was undertaken.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who
was willing to prevent his Father from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
her Abſurdities; theſe Men had no
other Deſign, than to rob us of our Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0005700702:132"/>
How! ſaid <hi>Arabella:</hi> Were theſe Cavaliers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who appeared to be in ſo handſome a Garb,
that I took them for Perſons of prime Quality,
were they Robbers? I have been ſtrangely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
it ſeems: However, I apprehend there is
no Certainty, that your Suſpicions are true; and
it may ſtill be as I ſay, that they either came to
reſcue or carry us away.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> to avoid a longer Diſpute,

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARABELLA,</hi> during the reſt of this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
was ſo wholly taken up in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
upon the laſt Adventure, that ſhe mixed
but little in the Converſation. Upon their
drawing near <hi>Bath,</hi> the Situation of that City
afforded her the Means of making a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
between the Valley in which it was
placed (with the Amphitheatrical View of the
Hills around it) and the Valley of <hi>Tempe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas in ſuch a Place as this, ſaid ſhe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
her Compariſon, that the fair <hi>Andronice</hi>
delivered the valiant <hi>Hortenſius:</hi> And really I
could wiſh, our Entrance into that City might
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0005700702:133"/>
be preceded by an Act of equal Humanity
with that of that fair Princeſs.</p>
               <p>For the Gratification of that Wiſh, Madam,
ſid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> it is neceſſary ſome Perſon
ſhould meet with a Misfortune, out of which
you might be able to relieve him; but I ſuppoſe
the Benevolence of your Diſpoſition may be
equally ſatisfied with not finding any Occaſion,
as of exerciſing it, when it is found.</p>
               <p>Though it be not my Fortune to meet with
thoſe Occaſions, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> there is no
Reaſon to doubt but others do, who poſſibly
have leſs Inclination to afford their Aſſiſtance
than myſelf: And it is poſſible, if any other
than the Princeſs of <hi>Meſſina</hi> had happened to
paſs by, when <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was in the Hands of
the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> he would not have been reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued
from the ignominious Death he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined
to, merely for killing a Stork.</p>
               <p>How! interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> put a Man to
Death for killing a Stork! Ridiculous! Pray, in
what Part of the World did that happen?
Among the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> I ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>No, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> in <hi>Theſſaly;</hi> the faireſt
Part in all <hi>Macedonia,</hi> famous for the beautiful
Valley of <hi>Tempe,</hi> which excited the Curioſity
of all Travellers whatever.</p>
               <p>No, not all, Madam, returned Sir <hi>Charles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
for I am acquainted with ſeveral Travellers,
who never ſaw it, nor even mentioned it; and
if it is ſo famous as you ſay, I am ſurpriſed I
never heard of it before.</p>
               <p>I don't know, ſaid <hi>Arabélla,</hi> what thoſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
thought worthy of their Notice; but I
am certain, that if any Chance ſhould conduct
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0005700702:134"/>
me into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> I would not leave it till I
ſaw the Valley of <hi>Tempe,</hi> ſo celebrated by all
the Poets and Hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>Dear Couſin, cried <hi>Glanville,</hi> who could
hardly forbear ſmiling, what Chance, in the
Name of Wonder, ſhould take you into <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
at ſo great a Diſtance from your own
Country?</p>
               <p>And ſo, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> this famous Valley
of <hi>Tempe</hi> is in <hi>Turky.</hi> Why you muſt be
very fond of travelling, indeed, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi>
if you would go into the <hi>Great Mogul</hi>'s Country,
where the People are all Pagans, they ſay,
and worſhip the Devil.</p>
               <p>The Country my Couſin ſpeaks of, ſaid Mr.
<hi>Glanville,</hi> is in the Grand Signor's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
The Great Mogul, you know, Sir—</p>
               <p>Well, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> the Great
Mogul, or the Grand Signor, I know not
what you call him: But I hope my Niece does
not propoſe to go thither.</p>
               <p>Not unleſs I am forcibly carried thither, ſaid
<hi>Arabella;</hi> but I do determine, if that Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſhould ever happen to me, that I would,
if poſſible, viſit the Vale of <hi>Tempe,</hi> which is
in that Part of <hi>Greece</hi> they call <hi>Macedonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then I am perſuaded, replied Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
you'll never ſee that famous Valley you talk of;
for it is not very likely you ſhould be forcibly
carried away into <hi>Turky.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why do you think it unlikely, that I
ſhould be carried thither? interrupted <hi>Arabella.</hi>
Do not the ſame Things happen now, that
did formerly? And is any thing more common,
then Ladies being carried, by their Raviſhers,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0005700702:135"/>
into Countries far diſtant from their own? May
not the ſame Accidents happen to me, that have
happened to ſo many illuſtrious Ladies before
me? And may I not be carried into <hi>Macedonia</hi>
by a Similitude of Deſtiny with that of a great
many beautiful Princeſſes, who, though born in
the moſt diſtant Quarters of the World, chanced
to meet at one time in the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
and related their miraculous Adventures to each
other?</p>
               <p>And it was for that very Purpoſe they met,
Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſmiling.</p>
               <p>Why, truly, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> it happened very
luckily for each of them, that they were
brought into a Place where they found ſo many
illuſtrious Companions in Misfortune, to whom
they might freely communicate their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which otherwiſe might, haply, have been
concealed, or, at leaſt, have been imperfectly
delivered down to us: However, added ſhe,
ſmiling, if I am carried into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and
by that means have an Opportunity of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the famous Vale of <hi>Tempe,</hi> I ſhall take care
not to draw the Reſentment of the <hi>Theſſalians</hi>
upon me, by an Indiſcretion like that of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For be pleaſed to know, Sir, ſaid ſhe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
herſelf to her Uncle, that his killing a
Stork, however inconſiderable a Matter it may
appear to us, was yet looked upon as a Crime
of a very atrocious Nature among the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalians;</hi>
for they have a Law, which forbids,
upon Pain of Death, the killing of Storks;
the Reaſon for which is, that <hi>Theſſaly</hi> being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be infeſted with a prodigious Multitude
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0005700702:136"/>
of Serpents, which are a delightful Food to
theſe Sorts of Fowls, they look upon them as
ſacred Birds, ſent by the Gods to deliver them
from theſe Serpents and Vipers: And though
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> being a Stranger, was pardoned
through the Interceſſion of the Princeſs <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
they made him promiſe to ſend another
Stork into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> to the end that he might

the Ladies retired to their different Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
to repoſe themſelves after the Fatigue
of their Journey, and did not meet again till
Supper was on Table; when Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
who had eagerly enquired what Company
was then in the Place, and heard there were a
great many Perſons of Faſhion juſt arrived,
preſt <hi>Arabella</hi> to go to the Pump-Room the
next Morning, aſſuring her ſhe would find a
very agreeable Amuſement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> accordingly conſented to accompany
her; and, being told the Ladies went in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of a Morning, ſhe accommodated herſelf
to the Cuſtom, and went in a negligent Dreſs;
but inſtead of a Capuchin, ſhe were ſomething
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0005700702:137"/>
like a Veil, of black Gauze, which covered
almoſt all her Face, and Part of her Waiſt, and
gave her a very ſingular Appearance.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> was too envious of her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin's
Superiority in point of Beauty, to inform
her of any Oddity in her Dreſs, which ſhe
thought might expoſe her to the Ridicule of
thoſe that ſaw her; and Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was too
little a Critic in Ladies Apparel, to be ſenſible
that <hi>Arabella</hi> was not in the Faſhion; and ſince
every thing ſhe wore became her extremely,
he could not chooſe but think ſhe dreſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
well: He handed her therefore, with a
great deal of Satisfaction, into the Pump-Room,
which happened to be greatly crouded
that Morning.</p>
               <p>The Attention of moſt Part of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was immediately engaged by the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
Lady <hi>Bella</hi> made. Strangers are here moſt
ſtrictly criticized, and every new Object affords
a delicious Feaſt of Raillery and Scandal.</p>
               <p>The Ladies, alarmed at the Singularity of
her Dreſs, crouded together in Parties; and
the Words, Who can ſhe be? Strange Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!
Ridiculous! and other Exclamations of
the ſame Kind, were whiſpered very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly.</p>
               <p>The Men were ſtruck with her Figure,
veiled as ſhe was: Her fine Stature, the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Turn of her Perſon, the Grace and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of her Motion, attracted all their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice:
The Phaenomena of the Veil, however,
gave them great Diſturbance. So lovely a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſeemed to promiſe the Owner had a Face
not unworthy of it; but that was totally hid
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0005700702:138"/>
from their View: For <hi>Arabella,</hi> at her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Room, had pulled the Gauze
quite over her Face, following therein the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Ladies in <hi>Clelia,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
who, in mixed Companies, always hid their
Faces with great Care.</p>
               <p>The Wits, and Pretty-Fellows, railed at the
envious Covering, and compared her to the
Sun obſcured by a Cloud; while the Beaux
<hi>dem'd</hi> the horrid Innovation, and expreſſed a
Fear, leſt it ſhould grow into a Faſhion.</p>
               <p>Some of the wiſer Sort took her for a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner;
others, of ſtill more Sagacity, ſuppoſed
her a <hi>Scots</hi> Lady, covered with her Plaid; and
a third Sort, infinitely wiſer than either, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
ſhe was a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nun, that had eſcaped
from a Convent, and had not yet quitted her
Veil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> ignorant of the Diverſity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
to which her Appearance gave Riſe, was
taken up in diſcourſing with Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>
upon the medicinal Virtue of the Springs, the
Oeconomy of the Baths, the Nature of the
Diverſions, and ſuch other Topics, as the
Objects around them furniſhed her with.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> was got
amidſt a Croud of her Acquaintance, who had
hardly paid the Civilities of a firſt Meeting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they eagerly inquired, who that Lady ſhe
brought with her was.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> informed them, that ſhe was
her Couſin, and Daughter to the deceaſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of—adding with a Sneer, That ſhe had
been brought up in the Country; knew nothing
of the World; and had ſome very peculiar No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0005700702:139"/>
as you may ſee, ſaid ſhe, by that odd
kind of Covering ſhe wears.</p>
               <p>Her Name and Quality were preſently whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
all over the Room: The Men, hearing
ſhe was a great Heireſs, found greater Beauties
to admire in her Perſon: The Ladies, aw'd
by the Sanction of Quality, dropt their Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule
on her Dreſs, and began to quote Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Whims full as inexcuſable.</p>
               <p>One remembred, that Lady <hi>J—T—</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>always
wore her Ruffles reverſed; that the
Counteſs of—went to Court in a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingale;
that the Ducheſs of—ſat aſtride
upon a Horſe; and a certain Lady of great
Fortune, and nearly allied to Quality, becauſe
ſhe was not dignified with a Title, invented a
new one for herſelf; and directed her Servants
to ſay in ſpeaking to her, <hi>Your Honoureſs,</hi> which
afterwards became a Cuſtom among all her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
who mortally offended her, if
they omitted that Inſtance of Reſpect.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing ſome hiſtorical Anecdotes, the
Truth of which may poſſibly be doubted,
as they are not to be found in any of the
Hiſtorians.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER a ſhort Stay in the Room, <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
expreſſing a Deſire to return home,
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> conducted her out. Two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of his Acquaintance attending Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0005700702:140"/>
Sir, <hi>Charles</hi> detained them to Breakfaſt;
by which means they had an Opportunity of
ſatisfying their Curioſity; and beheld <hi>Arabella,</hi>
diveſted of that Veil, which had, as they ſaid;
and 'tis probable they ſaid no more than they
thought, concealed one of the fineſt Faces in
the World.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> had the Mortification to ſee
both the Gentlemen ſo charmed with the Sight
of her Couſin's Face, that for a long time ſhe
ſat wholly neglected; but the Seriouſneſs of her
Behaviour, giving ſome little Diſguſt to the
youngeſt of them, who was what the Ladies
call a Pretty-Fellow, a dear Creature, and the
moſt diverting Man in the World; he applied
himſelf wholly to Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> and ſoon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
her in a particular Converſation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> ſo was the other Gentleman
called, was of a much graver Caſt: He affected
to be thought deep-read in Hiſtory, and never
failed to take all Opportunities of diſplaying
his Knowlege of Antiquity, which was indeed
but very ſuperficial; but having ſome few Anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes
by Heart, which he would take Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to introduce as often as he could, he paſſed
among many Perſons for one, who, by Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Study, had acquired an univerſal
Knowlege of antient Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Speaking of any particular Circumſtance, he
would fix the Time, by computing the Year
with the Number of the Olympiads.</p>
               <p>It happened, he would ſay, in the 141ſt
Olympiad.</p>
               <p>Such an amazing Exactneſs, had a ſuitable
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0005700702:141"/>
Effect on his Audience, and always procured
him a great Degree of Attention.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman hitherto had no Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of diſplaying his Knowledge of Hiſtory,
the Diſcourſe having wholly turned upon News,
and other Trifles; when <hi>Arabella,</hi> after ſome
more Inquiries concerning the Place, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that there was a very great Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the medicinal Waters at <hi>Bath,</hi> and the
fine Springs at the Foot of the Mountain <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopylae</hi>
in <hi>Greece,</hi> as well in their Qualities, as
manner of uſing them; and I am of Opinion,
added ſhe, that <hi>Bath,</hi> famous as it is for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
Health, is leſs frequented by infirm
Perſons, than the famous Springs of <hi>Thermopylae</hi>
were by the Beauties of <hi>Greece,</hi> to whom thoſe
Waters have the Reputation of giving new
Luſtre.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> who, with all his Reading, had
never met with any Account of theſe celebrated
<hi>Grecian</hi> Springs, was extremely diſconcerted at
not being able to continue a Converſation,
which the Silence of the reſt of the Company
made him imagine, was directed wholly to
him.</p>
               <p>The Shame he conceived at ſeeing himſelf
poſed by a Girl, in a Matter which ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
belonged to him, made him reſolve to
draw himſelf out of this Dilemma at any Rate;
aud, though he was far from being convinced,
that there were no ſuch Springs at <hi>Thermopylae</hi> as
<hi>Arabella</hi> mentioned; yet he reſolutely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that ſhe muſt be miſtaken in their Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for, to his certain Knowlege, there were
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0005700702:142"/>
no medicinal Waters at the Foot of that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who could not endure to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
in what ſhe took to be ſo inconteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Fact, reddened with Vexation at his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Denial.</p>
               <p>It ſhould ſeem, ſaid ſhe, by your Diſcourſe,
that you are unacquainted with many material
Paſſages, that paſſed among very illuſtrious
Perſons there; and if you knew any thing of
<hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> you would know, that
an Adventure he had at thoſe Baths, laid the
Foundation of all thoſe great Deſigns, which he
afterwards effected, to the total Subverſion of
the <hi>Athenian</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> ſurpriſed that this Piece of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
had likewiſe eſcaped his Obſervation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
however, not to give up his Point.</p>
               <p>I think, Madam, replied he, with great
Self-ſufficiency, that I am pretty well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with every thing which relates to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commonwealth; and know
by what Steps <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> advanced himſelf to
the Sovereignty. It was a great Stroke of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
in him, ſaid he, turning to Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
indeed, to wound himſelf, in order to get a
Guard aſſigned him.</p>
               <p>You are miſtaken, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> if you
believe, there was any Truth in the Report of
his having wounded himſelf: It was done, either
by his Rival <hi>Lycurgus</hi> or <hi>Theocrites;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
him ſtill to be in Love with the fair
<hi>Cerinthe,</hi> whom he courted, took that Way to
get rid of him: Neither is it true, that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
alone inſpired <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> with a Deſign of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0005700702:143"/>
enſlaving his Country: Thoſe Authors who ſay
ſo, muſt know little of the Springs and Motives
of his Conduct. It was neither Ambition nor
Revenge, that made him act as he did; it was
the violent Affection he conceived for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Chorante,</hi> whom he firſt ſaw at the famous
Baths of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> which put him upon thoſe
Deſigns; for, ſeeing that <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who was
not his Rival in Ambition, but Love, would
certainly become the Poſſeſſor of <hi>Chorante,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he made himſelf Tyrant of <hi>Athens,</hi> he had
recourſe to that violent Method, in order to
preſerve her for himſelf.</p>
               <p>I proteſt, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> caſting
down his Eyes in great Confuſion at her ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Knowlege in Hiſtory, theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
have all eſcaped my Notice; and this is the
firſt time I ever underſtood, that <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> was
violently in Love; and that it was not Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which made him aſpire to Sovereignty.</p>
               <p>I do not remember any Mention of this in
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> continued he, rubbing his Forehead,
or any of the Authors who have treated on the
Affairs of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very likely, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella;</hi> but you
will ſee the whole Story of <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi>'s Love
for <hi>Chorante,</hi> with the Effects it produced, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
at large in <hi>Scudery.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Scudery,</hi> Madam! ſaid the ſage Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi>
I never read that Hiſtorian.</p>
               <p>No, Sir! replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> then your Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
has been very confined.</p>
               <p>I know, Madam, ſaid he, that <hi>Herodotus,
Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> have indeed quoted
him frequently.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0005700702:144"/>
I am ſurpriſed, Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who
was exceſſively diverted at this Diſcovery of
his great Ignorance and Affectation, that you
have not read that famous Hiſtorian; eſpecially,
as the Writers you have mentioned quote him
ſo often.</p>
               <p>Why, to tell you the Truth, Sir, ſaid he;
though he was a <hi>Roman;</hi> yet it is objected to
him, that he wrote but indifferent <hi>Latin;</hi> with
no Purity or Elegance; and—</p>
               <p>You are quite miſtaken, Sir, interrupted
<hi>Arabella;</hi> the great <hi>Scudery</hi> was a <hi>Frenchman;</hi>
and both his <hi>Clelia</hi> and <hi>Artamenes</hi> were written
in <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Frenchman</hi> was he? ſaid Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> with
a lofty Air: Oh! then, 'tis not ſurpriſing,
that I have not read him: I read no Authors,
but the Antients, Madam, added he, with a
Look of Self-applauſe; I cannot reliſh the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns
at all: I have no Taſte for their Way of
Writing.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Scudery</hi> muſt needs be more ancient
than <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe <hi>Greek</hi>
Hiſtorians you mentioned, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville:</hi>
How elſe could they quote him?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> was here ſo utterly at a Loſs, that
he could not conceal his Confuſion: He held
down his Head, and continued ſilent; while the
Beau, who had liſtened to the latter Part of their
Diſcourſe; exerted his ſuppoſed Talent of
Raillery againſt the unhappy Admirer of the
antient Authors; and increaſed his Confuſion
by a thouſand Sarcaſms, which gave more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to himſelf, than any body elſe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Which contains ſome excellent Rules for
Raillery.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who had too much Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Good nature to inſiſt too long
upon the Ridicule in the Character of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
changed the Diſcourſe: And <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
who had obſerved, with ſome Concern,
the ill-judged Raillery of the young Beau, took
Occaſion to decry that Species of Wit; and
gave it as her Opinion, that it was very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and unpleaſing.</p>
               <p>For, truly, ſaid ſhe, it is almoſt impoſſible
to uſe it without being hated or feared: and
whoever gets a Habit of it, is in Danger of
wronging all the Laws of Friendſhip and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
               <p>Certainly, purſued ſhe, looking at the Beau,
it is extremely unjuſt to railly one's Friends, and
particular Acquaintance: Firſt, chooſe them well,
and be as nice as you pleaſe in the Choice; but
when you have choſen them, by no means play
upon them: 'Tis cruel and malicious, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
one's ſelf at the Expence of one's Friend.</p>
               <p>However, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who
was charmed to hear her talk ſo rationally, you
may give People Leave to railly their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Truly, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> I cannot allow
that, any more than upon Friends; for Raillery
is the pooreſt kind of Revenge that can be taken:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0005700702:146"/>
Methinks, it is mean to railly Perſons who
have a ſmall Share of Merit; ſince, haply, their
Defects were born with them, and not of their
own acquiring; and it is great Injuſtice to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
upon one ſlight Fault in Men of Parts, to
the Prejudice of a thouſand good Qualities.</p>
               <p>For aught I ſee, Madam, ſaid the Beau, you
will not allow one to railly any body.</p>
               <p>I am of Opinion, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that
there are very few proper Objects for Raillery;
and ſtill fewer, who can railly well: The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of Raillery ought to be born with a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
no Art can infuſe it; and thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to railly in ſpite of Nature, will be ſo
far from diverting others, that they will become
the Objects of Ridicule themſelves.</p>
               <p>Many other pleaſing Qualities of Wit may
be acquired by Pains and Study, but Raillery
muſt be the Gift of Nature: It is not enough
to have many lively and agreeable Thoughts;
but there muſt be ſuch an Expreſſion, as muſt
convey their full Force and Meaning; the
Air the Aſpect, the Tone of the Voice, and
every Part in general, muſt contribute to its
Perfection.</p>
               <p>There ought alſo to be a great Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Raillery and Satire, ſo that one may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be miſtaken for the other: Raillery ought
indeed to ſurpriſe, and ſenſibly touch, thoſe to
whom it is directed; but I would not have the
Wounds it makes, either deep or laſting: Let
thoſe who feel it, be hurt like Perſons, who,
gathering Roſes, are pricked by the Thorns,
and find a ſweet Smoll to make amends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0005700702:147"/>
I would have Raillery raiſe the Fancy, and
quicken the Imagination, the Fire of its Wit
ſhould only enable us to trace its Original,
and ſhine as the Stars do, but not burn.
Yet, after all, I cannot greatly approve of
Raillery, or ceaſe to think it dangerous; and,
to purſue my Compariſon, ſaid ſhe, with an
inchanting Smile, Perſons who poſſeſs the
true Talent of Raillery, are like Comets; they
are ſeldom ſeen, and are at once admir'd and
fear'd.</p>
               <p>I proteſt, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who
had liſten'd to her with many Signs of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
you ſpeak like an Orator.</p>
               <p>One would not imagine, interrupted Mr.
<hi>Glanville,</hi> who ſaw <hi>Arabella</hi> in ſome Confuſion
at the coarſe Praiſe her Uncle gave her, that
my Couſin could ſpeak ſo accurately of a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſhe never practiſes: And 'tis eaſy to judge
by what ſhe has ſaid, that no body can railly
finer than herſelf, if ſhe pleaſes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> tho' he bore her a Grudge for
knowing more Hiſtory than he did, yet aſſur'd
her, that ſhe had given the beſt Rules imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

ſhe had ſilenc'd by her Reproof, was extremely
angry; and, ſuppoſing it would mortify her to
ſee him pay Court to her Couſin, he redoubled
his Aſſiduities to Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was highly

was form'd on the Manners of the Heroines,
order'd the Woman to make her a Robe after
the ſame Model as the Princeſs <hi>Julia</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>The Mantua-maker, who thought it might
do her great Prejudice with her new Cuſtomer,
to acknowledge ſhe knew nothing of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<hi>Julia,</hi> or the Faſhion of her Gown, replied
at Random, and with great Pertneſs,</p>
               <p>That, that Taſte was quite out; and, ſhe
would adviſe her Ladyſhip to have her Cloaths
made in the preſent Mode, which was far more
becoming.</p>
               <p>You can never perſuade me, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
that any Faſhion can be more becoming than
that of the Princeſs <hi>Julia</hi>'s, who was the moſt
gallant Princeſs upon Earth, and knew better
than any other, how to ſet off her Charms.
It may indeed be a little obſelete now, purſued
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0005700702:149"/>
ſhe, for the Faſhion could not but alter a little
in the Compaſs of near two thouſand Years.</p>
               <p>Two thouſand Years! Madam, ſaid the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in a great Surprize; Lord help us Trades-people,
if they did not alter a thouſand Times
in as many Days! I thought your Ladyſhip
was ſpeaking of the laſt Month's Taſte; which,
as I ſaid before, is quite out now.</p>
               <p>Well, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> let the preſent Mode
be what it will, I inſiſt upon having my Cloaths
made after the Pattern of the beautiful Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> being convinced, that none
other can be half ſo becoming.</p>
               <p>What Faſhion was that, pray, Madam, ſaid
the Woman? I never ſaw it.</p>
               <p>How, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> Have you already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the Faſhion of the Princeſs <hi>Julia</hi>'s Robe,
which you ſaid was wore but laſt Month? Or,
are you ignorant that the Princeſs <hi>Julia,</hi> and
the Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> is the ſame Perſon?</p>
               <p>I proteſt, Madam, ſaid the Woman, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
confus'd, I had forgot that, till you
called it to my Mind.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> make me a Robe in the
ſame Taſte.</p>
               <p>The Mantua-maker was now wholly at a
Loſs in what Manner to behave; for, being
conſcious that ſhe knew nothing of the Princeſs
<hi>Julia</hi>'s Faſhion, ſhe could not undertake to
make it without Directions; and ſhe was afraid
of diſcovering her Ignorance by asking for any;
ſo that her Silence and Embarraſſment perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Arabella</hi> ſhe knew nothing of the Matter,
ſhe diſmiſt her with a ſmall Preſent, for the
Trouble ſhe had given her, and had Recourſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0005700702:150"/>
to her uſual Expedient, which was, to make
one of her Women, who underſtood a little of
the Mantua-making Buſineſs, make a Robe for
her, after her own Directions.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who imagin'd ſhe had ſent
for Work-women, in order to have Cloaths
made in the modern Taſte, was ſurpriz'd at her
Entrance into her Chamber, to ſee her dreſſing
for the Ball, in a Habit ſingular to the laſt
Degree.</p>
               <p>She wore no Hoop, and the Blue and Silver
Stuff of her Robe, was only kept by its own
Richneſs, from hanging cloſe about her. It
was quite open round her Breaſt, which was
ſhaded with a rich Border of Lace; and claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cloſe to her Waiſt, by ſmall Knots of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
deſcended in a ſweeping Train on the
Ground.</p>
               <p>The Sleeves were ſhort, wide, and ſlaſh'd,
faſtned in different Places with Diamonds, and
her Arms were partly hid by half a Dozen Falls
of Ruffles. Her Hair, which fell in very eaſy
Ringlets on her Neck, was plac'd with great
Care and Exactneſs round her lovely Face; and
the Jewels and Ribbons, which were all her
Head-dreſs, diſpos'd to the greateſt Advantage.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, nothing could be more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
becoming than her Dreſs; or ſet off
with greater Advantage the ſtriking Beauties of
her Perſon.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> tho' ſhe was not diſpleas'd to
ſee her perſiſt in her Singularity of Dreſs; yet
could not behold her look ſo lovely in it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feeling a ſecret Uneaſineſs; but conſoling
herſelf with the Hopes of the Ridicule ſhe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0005700702:151"/>
would occaſion, ſhe aſſum'd a chearful Air,
approv'd her Taſte in the Choice of her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and went with her at the uſual Hour,
to the Rooms, attended by Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> and the young Beau we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mention'd.</p>
               <p>The Surprize <hi>Arabella</hi>'s unuſual Appearance
gave to the whole Company, was very viſible
to every one but herſelf.</p>
               <p>The Moment ſhe enter'd the Room, every
one whiſper'd the Perſon next to them; and for
ſome Moments, nothing was heard but the
Words, the Princeſs <hi>Julia;</hi> which was eccho'd
at every Corner, and at laſt attracted her Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> and the reſt of the Company
with her, were in ſome Confuſion at the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Exclamation, which they imagin'd was
occaſion'd by the Singularity of her Habit;
tho' they could not conceive, why they gave
her that Title. Had they known the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Mantua-maker, it would doubtleſs
have eaſily occurr'd to them; for the Woman
had no ſooner left <hi>Arabella,</hi> than ſhe related
the Conference ſhe had with a Lady newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
who had requir'd her to make a Robe in
the Manner of the Princeſs <hi>Julia</hi>'s; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd
her, becauſe ſhe did not underſtand the
Faſhions that prevail'd two thouſand Years ago.</p>
               <p>This Story was quickly diſpers'd, and for its
Novelty, afforded a great deal of Diverſion;
every one long'd to ſee a Faſhion of ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
and expected the Appearance of the
Princeſs <hi>Julia</hi> with great Impatience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0005700702:152"/>
It is not to be doubted but much Mirth was
treaſur'd up for her Appearance; and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
Humouriſt had already prepared his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
Jeſt, when the Sight of the devoted
fair One repell'd his Vivacity, and the deſign'd
Ridicule of the whole Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Scarce had the firſt tumultous Whiſper eſcap'd
the Lips of each Individual, when they found
themſelves aw'd to Reſpect by that irreſiſtable
Charm in the Perſon of <hi>Arabella,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Reverence and Love from all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
her.</p>
               <p>Her noble Air, the native Dignity in her
Looks, the inexpreſſible Grace which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
all her Motions, and the conſummate
Lovelineſs of her Form, drew the Admiration
of the whole Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>A reſpectful Silence ſucceeded, and the Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
her Beauty occaſion'd, left them no
Room to deſcant on the Abſurdity of her Dreſs.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who felt a malicious Joy at
the Sneers ſhe expected would be caſt on her
Couſin, was greatly diſappointed at the Defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which ſeem'd to be paid her; and to vent
ſome Part of her Spleen, took occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
her Surprize, at the Behaviour of the
Company on their Entrance; wondering what
they could mean by whiſpering the Princeſs
<hi>Julia</hi> to one another.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſmiling, I am not
leſs ſurpriz'd than you at it; and ſince they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
their Looks to me at the ſame Time, I
fancy they either took me for ſome Princeſs of
the Name of <hi>Julia,</hi> who is expected here to-Night,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0005700702:153"/>
or elſe flatter me with ſome Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to the beautiful Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Compariſon, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi>
who took all Occaſions to ſhew his Reading, is
too injurious to you, for I am of Opinion you
as much excel that licentious Lady in the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of your Perſon, as you do in the Qualities
of your Mind.</p>
               <p>I never heard Licentiouſneſs imputed to the
Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> ſaid <hi>Arabella;</hi>
and the moſt her Enemies can ſay of her, is,
that ſhe loved Admiration, and would permit
herſelf to be beloved, and to be told ſo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhewing any Signs of Diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>Bleſs me, Madam, interrupted Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi>
how ſtrangely do you miſtake the Character of
<hi>Julia:</hi> Tho' the Daughter of an Emperor,
ſhe was, pardon the Expreſſion, the moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
Proſtitute in <hi>Rome;</hi> many of her Intrigues
are recorded in Hiſtory; but to mention only
one, Was not her infamous Commerce with
<hi>Ovid,</hi> the Cauſe of his Baniſhment?</p>
            </div>

               <argument>
                  <p>Some Reflexions very fit, and others very

               </argument>
               <p>YOU ſpeak in ſtrange Terms, replied <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
bluſhing, of a Princeſs, who if ſhe
was not the moſt reſerv'd and ſevere Perſon in
the World, was yet nevertheleſs, abſolutely
chaſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0005700702:154"/>
I know there were People who repreſented
her Partiality for <hi>Ovid</hi> in a very unfavourable
Light; but that ingenious Poet, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
his Hiſtory to the great <hi>Agrippa,</hi> told him
in Confidence all that had paſs'd between him
and the Princeſs <hi>Julia,</hi> than which nothing
could be more innocent tho' a little indiſcreet.
For, 'tis certain that ſhe permitted him to love
her, and did not condemn him to any rigorous
Puniſhment for daring to tell her ſo; yet, for
all this, as I ſaid before, tho' ſhe was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſo auſtere as ſhe ought to have been, yet
ſhe was nevertheleſs a moſt virtuous Princeſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> not daring to contradict a Lady
whoſe extenſive Reading had furniſh'd her with
Anecdotes unknown almoſt to any Body elſe,
by his Silence confeſs'd her Superiority. But
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who knew all theſe Anecdotes
were drawn from Romances, which he found
contradicted the known Facts in Hiſtory, and
aſſign'd the moſt ridiculous Cauſes for Things
of the greateſt Importance; could not help
ſmiling at the Facility with which Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi>
gave into thoſe idle Abſurdities. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his Affectation of great Reading, his
ſuperficial Knowledge of Hiſtory made it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
eaſy to deceive him; and as it was his
Cuſtom to mark in his Pocket-Book all the
Scraps of Hiſtory he heard introduced into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and retail them again in other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
he did not doubt but he would make a
Figure with the curious Circumſtances <hi>Arabella</hi>
had furniſh'd him with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> obſerving Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> by his familiar
Bows, ſignificant Smiles, and eaſy Salutations,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0005700702:155"/>
was acquainted with the greateſt Part of the
Aſſembly, told him, that ſhe did not doubt but
he knew the Adventures of many Perſons whom
they were viewing; and that he would do her
a Pleaſure, if he would relate ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> was charm'd with a Requeſt which
afforded him an Opportunity of gratifying a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
Inclination, and ſeating himſelf near
her immediately, was beginning to obey her
Injunctions, when ſhe gracefully intreated him
to ſtay a Moment; and calling to Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>
and his Siſter, who were talking to Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi>
ask'd them if they choſe to partake of a more
rational Amuſement than Dancing, and liſten
to the Adventures of ſome illuſtrious Perſons,
which Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> had promis'd to relate.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
ſmiling, you will find that a leſs innocent
Amuſement than Dancing.</p>
               <p>Why ſo, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſince it is not
an indiſcreet Curioſity which prompts me to a
Deſire of hearing the Hiſtories Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> has
promis'd to entertain me with; but rather a
Hope of hearing ſomething which may at once
improve and delight me; ſomething which
may excite my Admiration, engage my Eſteem,
or influence my Practice.</p>
               <p>'Twas doubtleſs, with ſuch Motives as theſe,
that we find Princeſſes and Ladies of the moſt
illuſtrious Rank, in <hi>Clelia</hi> and the Grand <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
liſtning to the Adventures of Perſons, in whom
they were probably as little intereſted, as we
are in theſe around us. Kings, Princes, and
Commanders of Armies, thought it was no
Waſte of their Time, in the midſt of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0005700702:156"/>
Hurry and Clamour of a Camp, to liſten many
Hours to the Relation of one ſingle Hiſtory,
and not fill'd with any extraordinary Events;
but haply a ſimple Recital of common Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences:
The great <hi>Cyrus,</hi> while he was buſy
in reducing all <hi>Aſia</hi> to his Yoke, heard never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
the Hiſtories of all the conſiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the Camp, beſides thoſe of Strangers,
and even his Enemies. If there was therefore
any thing either criminal or mean, in hearing
the Adventures of others, do you imagine ſo
many great and illuſtrious Perſons would have
given in to ſuch an Amuſement?</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Arabella</hi> turn'd gravely about to
Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> and told him, he was at Liberty to
begin his Recital.</p>
               <p>The Beau, a little diſconcerted by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
with which ſhe requeſted his Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
knew not how to begin with the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that he ſaw was required of him; and
therefore fat ſilent for a few Moments; which
<hi>Arabella</hi> ſuppos'd was to recall to his Memory
all the Paſſages he propos'd to relate.</p>
               <p>His Perplexity would probably have increas'd
inſtead of leſſening by the profound Silence
which ſhe obſerved, had not Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
ſeated herſelf with a ſprightly Air on the other
Side of him, and directing his Eyes to a tall
handſome Woman that had juſt enter'd, ask'd
him pleaſantly, to tell her Hiſtory if he knew it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> brought into his uſual Track by
this Queſtion, anſwer'd ſmiling, That the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory

                  </gap> from her own Mouth.</p>
               <p>No, really, Madam, anſwer'd Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi>
ſurpriz'd at the great Simplicity of <hi>Arabella,</hi>
for ſo he underſtood it; the Lady, I believe, is
not ſo communicative: And to ſay the Truth,
I ſhould not chuſe to hear her Adventures from
herſelf, ſince ſhe certainly would ſuppreſs the
moſt material Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>In a Word, ſaid he, lowering his Voice,
That Lady was for many Years the Miſtreſs of
a young military Nobleman, whom ſhe was ſo
complaiſant to follow in all his Campaigns,
Marches, Sieges, and every Inconveniency of
War: He married her in <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> from
whence he is lately arriv'd, and introduc'd his
new Lady to his noble Brother, by whom ſhe
was not unfavourably receiv'd. 'Tis worth
remarking, that this ſame haughty Peer thought
ſit to reſent with implacable Obſtinacy, the
Marriage of another of his Brothers, with the
Widow of a brave Officer, of conſiderable
Rank in the Army. 'Tis true, ſhe was ſeveral
Years older than the young Lord, and had no
Fortune; but the Duke aſſign'd other Reaſons
for his Diſpleaſure: He complain'd loudly, that
his Brother had diſhonour'd the Nobility of his
Birth, by this Alliance, and continued his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
till the Death of the young Hero, who
gave many remarkable Proofs of his Courage
and Fortitude upon ſeveral Occaſions, and died
gloriouſly before the Walls of <hi>Carthagena;</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0005700702:158"/>
leaving his diſconſolate Lady a Widow a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Time, with the Acquiſition of a Title
indeed, but a very ſmall Addition to her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that gay, ſplendid Lady, I beſeech
you, Madam, purſued he, turning to <hi>Arabella;</hi>
how affectedly ſhe looks and talks, and throws
her Eyes around the Room, with a haughty
Self-ſufficiency in her Aſpect, and inſolent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
for every Thing but herſelf. Her Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
her Speech, her Motions, are all <hi>French;</hi>
nothing in <hi>England</hi> is able to pleaſe her; the
People ſo dull, ſo aukwardly polite, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſo groſs; no Delicacy, no Elegance, no
Magnificence in their Perſons, Houſes, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions;
every Thing is ſo diſtaſteful, there
is no living in ſuch a Place. One may crawl
about, indeed, ſhe ſays, and make a ſhift to
breathe in the odious Country, but one cannot
be ſaid to live; and with all the Requiſites to
render Life delightful, here, one can only ſuffer,
not enjoy it.</p>
               <p>Would one not imagine, purſued he, this
fine Lady was a Perſon of very exalted Rank,
who has the Sanction of Birth, Riches, and
Grandeur for her extraordinary Pride; and yet
ſhe is no other than the Daughter of an Inn-Keeper
at <hi>Spa,</hi> and had the exalted Poſt aſſign'd
her of attending new Lodgers to their Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
acquainting them with all the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of the Place, anſwering an humble
Queſtion or two concerning what Company
was in the Town, what Scandal was ſtirring,
and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0005700702:159"/>
One of our great Sea Commanders going
thither for his Health, happen'd to lodge at this
Inn; and was ſo ſtruck with her Charms, that
he marry'd her in a few Weeks, and ſoon after
brought her to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the Origin of this fantaſtick Lady;
whoſe inſupportable Pride and ridiculous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,
draws Contempt and Averſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhe
appears.</p>
               <p>Did I not tell you, Madam, interrupted
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> that the Amuſement you had
choſe was not ſo innocent as Dancing? What a
deal of Scandal has Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> utter'd in the
Compaſs of a few Minutes?</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> I know not
what to make of the Hiſtories he has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating.
I think they do not deſerve that Name,
and are rather detatched Pieces of Satire on
particular Perſons, than a ſerious Relation of
Facts. I confeſs my Expectations from this
Gentleman have not been anſwer'd.</p>
               <p>I think, however, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
we may allow that there is a negative
Merit in the Relations Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> has made;
for, if he has not ſhewn us any Thing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
he has at leaſt ſhewn us what to condemn.</p>
               <p>The Uglineſs of Vice, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi>
ought only to be repreſented to the Vicious;
to whom Satire, like a magnifying Glaſs, may
aggravate every Defect, in order to make its
Deformity appear more hideous; but ſince its
End is only to reprove and amend, it ſhould
never be addreſs'd to any but thoſe who come
within its Correction, and may be the better
for it: A virtuous Mind need not be ſhewn
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0005700702:160"/>
the Deformity of Vice, to make it be hated and
avoided; the more pure and uncorrupted our
Ideas are, the leſs ſhall we be inſluenc'd by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
A natural Propenſity to Virtue or
Vice often determines the Choice: 'Tis ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
therefore to ſhew a good Mind what it
ought to purſue, though a bad one muſt be told
what to avoid. In a Word, one ought to be
always incited, the other always reſtrain'd.</p>
               <p>I vow, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
you'd make one think one came here to hear a
Sermon; you are ſo very grave, and talk upon
ſuch high-flown Subjects. What Harm was
there in what Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> was telling us? It
would be hard indeed, if one might not divert
one's ſelf with other Peoples Faults.</p>
               <p>I am afraid, Miſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> thoſe who
can divert themſelves with the Faults of others,
are not behind hand in affording Diverſion.
And that very Inclination, added ſhe, ſmilingly,
to hear other Peoples Faults, may by thoſe very
People, be condemned as one, and afford them
the ſame Kind of ill-natur'd Pleaſure you are
ſo deſirous of.</p>
               <p>Nay, Madam, return'd Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> your
Ladyſhip was the firſt who introduc'd the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
you condemn ſo much. Did not you
deſire Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> to tell you Hiſtories about the
Company; and ask my brother and me, to
come and hear them?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> that I did deſire
you to partake with me of a pleaſing and
rational Amuſement, for ſuch I imagin'd
Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi>'s Hiſtories might afford; far from a
Detail of Vices, Follies, and Irregularities, I
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0005700702:161"/>
expected to have heard the Adventures of ſome
illuſtrious Perſonages related; between whoſe
Actions, and thoſe of the Heroes and Heroines
of Antiquity, I might have found ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance.</p>
               <p>For Inſtance, I hop'd to have heard imitated
the ſublime Courage of a <hi>Clelia,</hi> who, to ſave
her Honour from the Attempts of the impious
<hi>Tarquin,</hi> leap'd into the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> and ſwam
to the other Side; or the noble Reſolution of
the incomparable <hi>Candace,</hi> who, to eſcape out
of the Hands of her Raviſher, the Pirate <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadorus,</hi>
ſet Fire to his Veſſel with her own
Hands, and committed herſelf to the Mercy of
the Waves: Or, the Conſtancy and Affection
of a <hi>Mandana,</hi> who, for the Sake of a <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
refuſed the richeſt Crowns in the World, and
braved the Terrors of Death to preſerve herſelf
for him.</p>
               <p>As for the Men, I hoped to have heard of
ſome who might have almoſt equall'd the great
<hi>Oroondates,</hi> the invincible <hi>Artaban,</hi> the valiant
<hi>Juba,</hi> the renowned <hi>Alcamenes,</hi> and many
thouſand Heroes of Antiquity; whoſe glorious
Exploits in War, aud unſaken Conſtancy in
Love, have given them an immortal Fame.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Arabella</hi> was uttering this long Speech,
with great Emotion, Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> with a ſly
Look at the Beau, gave him to underſtand,
that was her Couſin's Foible.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> however, not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Meaning of what ſhe ſaid, liſten'd to
her with many Signs of Perplexity and Wonder.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> in ſecret repin'd at her prodigious
Knowledge of Hiſtory; and Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0005700702:162"/>
with his Eyes fix'd on the Ground, bit his Lips
almoſt through with Madneſs.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time, ſeveral among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
deſirous of hearing what the ſtrange
Lady was ſaying ſo loud, and with ſo much
Eagerneſs and Emotion, gather'd round them;
which Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> obſerving, and fearing
<hi>Arabella</hi> would expoſe herſelf ſtill farther, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
his Siſter to get her away if poſſible.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> tho' very unwilling, obey'd
his Injunctions; and complaining of a ſudden
Head-ach, <hi>Arabella</hi> immediately propos'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring,
which was joyfully complied with by
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who with the other Gentlemen
attended them home.</p>

                  <p>Being a Chapter of the Satyrical Kind.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AT their Return, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> told his Niece,
That ſhe had now had a Specimen of the
World, and ſome of the faſhionable Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and ask'd her, how ſhe had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd.</p>
               <p>Why, truly, Sir, replied ſhe, ſmiling, I
have brought away no great Reliſh for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal
of the Amuſement I have partaken of
To-night. If the World, in which you ſeem
to think I am but new initiated, affords only
theſe Kinds of Pleaſures, I ſhall very ſoon regret
the Solitude and Books I have quitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0005700702:163"/>
Why pray, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville?</hi> What Kind
of Amuſements did your Ladyſhip expect to
find in the World? And what was there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
in your Entertainment to Night? I
am ſure there is no Place in <hi>England,</hi> except
<hi>London,</hi> where there is ſo much good Company
to be met with, as here. The Aſſembly was
very numerous and brillant, and one can be at
no Loſs for Amuſements: The Pump-Room in
the Morning, the Parade, and the Rooms, in
the Evening, with little occaſional Parties of
Pleaſure, will find one ſufficient Employment,
and leave none of one's Time to lye uſeleſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one's Hand.</p>
               <p>I am of Opinion, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> that
one's Time is far from being well employ'd in
the Manner you portion it out: And People
who ſpend theirs in ſuch trifling Amuſements,
muſt certainly live to very little Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>What room, I pray you, does a Lady give
for high and noble Adventures, who conſumes
her Days in Dreſſing, Dancing, liſtening to
Songs, and ranging the Walks with People as
thoughtleſs as herſelf? How mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
a Figure muſt a Life ſpent in ſuch idle
Amuſements make in Hiſtory? Or rather, Are
not ſuch Perſons always buried in Oblivion,
and can any Pen be found who would conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to record ſuch inconſiderable Actions?</p>
               <p>Nor can I perſuade myſelf, added ſhe, that
any of thoſe Men whom I ſaw at the Aſſembly,
with Figures ſo feminine, Voices ſo ſoft, ſuch
tripping Steps, and unmeaning Geſtures, have
ever ſignalized either their Courage or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0005700702:164"/>
but might be overcome by their Enemy
in Battle, or be falſe to their Miſtreſs in Love.</p>
               <p>Law! Couſin, reply'd Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> you
are always talking of Battles and Fighting. Do
you expect that Perſons of Quality, and fine
Gentlemen, will go to the Wars? What Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
have they to fight? That belongs to the
Officers.</p>
               <p>Then every fine Gentleman is an Officer,
ſaid <hi>Arabella;</hi> and ſome other Title ought to
be found out for Men who do nothing but
Dance and Dreſs.</p>
               <p>I could never have imagined, interrupted
Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> ſurveying <hi>Arabella,</hi> that a Lady ſo
elegant and gay in her own Appearance, ſhould
have an Averſion to Pleaſure and Magnificence.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> I have
an Averſion to neither: On the contrary, I
am a great Admirer of both. But my Ideas
of Amuſements and Grandeur are probably
different from yours.</p>
               <p>I will allow the Ladies to be ſollicitous about
their Habits, and dreſs with all the Care and
Elegance they are capable of; but ſuch Trifles
are below the Conſideration of a Man, who
ought not to owe the Dignity of his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the Embroidery on his Coat, but to
his high and noble Air, the Grandeur of his
Courage, the Elevation of his Sentiments, and
the many heroick Actions he has perform'd.</p>
               <p>Such a Man will dreſs his Perſon with a
graceful Simplicity, and laviſh all his Gold and
Embroidery upon his Armour, to render him
conſpicuous in the Day of Battle. The Plumes
in his Helmet will look more graceful in the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0005700702:165"/>
Field, than the Feather in his Hat at a Ball;
and Jewels blaze with more Propriety on his
Shield and Cuiraſs in Battle, than glittering on
his Finger in a Dance.</p>
               <p>Do not imagine, however, purſued ſhe, that
I abſolutely condemn Dancing, and think it a
Diverſion wholly unworthy of a Hero.</p>
               <p>Hiſtory has recorded ſome very famous Balls,
at which the moſt illuſtrious Perſons in the
World have appear'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great, we are inform'd, open'd a
Ball with the divine <hi>Mandana</hi> at <hi>Sardis.</hi> The
renown'd King of <hi>Scythia</hi> danc'd with the
Princeſs <hi>Cleopatra</hi> at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The brave
<hi>Cleomedon</hi> with the fair <hi>Candace</hi> at <hi>Ethiopia;</hi>
but theſe Diverſions were taken but ſeldom,
and conſider'd indeed as an Amuſement, not as
a Part of the Buſineſs of Life.</p>
               <p>How would ſo many glorious Battles have
been fought, Cities taken, Ladies reſcu'd, and
other great and noble Adventures been atchiev'd,
if the Men, ſunk in Sloth and Effeminacy, had
continually follow'd the Sound of a Fiddle,
ſaunter'd in Publick Walks, and tattled over a
Tea-table.</p>
               <p>I vow, Couſin, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> you are
infinitely more ſevere in your Cenſures than
Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> was at the Aſſembly. You had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reaſon methinks to be angry with him.</p>
               <p>All I have ſaid, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> were the
natural Inference from your own Account of
the Manner in which People live here. When
Actions are a Cenſure upon themſelves, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer
will always be conſider'd as a Satiriſt.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Selvin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> who had liſten'd
attentively to this Diſcourſe of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
took Leave as ſoon as it was ended,
and went away with very different Opinions
of her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> declaring ſhe was a Fool, and had
no Knowledge of the World, and Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi>
convinc'd ſhe was a Wit, and very learn'd in
Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Certainly, ſaid Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> in Support of his
Opinion, the Lady has great Judgment; has
been capable of prodigious Application, as is
apparent by her extenſive Reading: Then her
Memory is quite miraculous. I proteſt, I am
quite charm'd with her: I never met with
ſuch a Woman in my Life.</p>
               <p>Her Couſin, in my Opinion, reply'd Mr.
<hi>Tinſel,</hi> is infinitely beyond her in every Merit,
but Beauty. How ſprightly and free her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation?
What a thorough Knowledge of
the World? So true a Taſte for polite Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and a Fund of Spirits that ſets Vapours
and Spleen at Defiance.</p>
               <p>This Speech bringing on a Compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Ladies, the Champions for each grew
ſo warm in the Diſpute, that they had like to
have quarrell'd. However, by the Interpoſition
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0005700702:167"/>
of ſome other Gentlemen who were with them,
they parted tolerable Friends that Night, and
renew'd their Viſits to Sir <hi>Charles</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>They found only Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> with her
Father and Brother. <hi>Arabella</hi> generally ſpent
the Mornings in her own Chamber, where
Reading and the Labours of the Toilet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
her Time till Dinner: Tho' it muſt be
confeſs'd to her Honour, that the latter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs'd
but a very ſmall Part of it.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> with whom the Beau had a
long Converſation at one of the Windows;
in which he recounted his Diſpute with Mr.
<hi>Selvin,</hi> and the Danger he ran of being pink'd
in a Duel, that was his Phraſe, for her Sake,
at laſt propos'd a Walk; to which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and engag'd to prevail upon <hi>Arabella</hi> to
accompany them.</p>
               <p>That Lady at firſt poſitively refus'd; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging
in Excuſe, That ſhe was ſo extremely
intereſted in the Fate of the Princeſs <hi>Meliſintha,</hi>
whoſe Story ſhe was reading, that ſhe could not
ſtir till ſhe had finiſh'd it.</p>
               <p>That poor Princeſs, continu'd ſhe, is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in a moſt terrible Situation. She has juſt
ſet Fire to the Palace, in order to avoid the
Embraces of a King who forc'd her to marry
him. I am in Pain to know how ſhe eſcapes
the Flames.</p>
               <p>Pſhaw, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> let her
periſh there, if ſhe will: Don't let her hinder
our Walk.</p>
               <p>Who is it you doom with ſo much Cruelty
to periſh, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> cloſing the Book, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0005700702:168"/>
looking ſtedfaſtly on her Couſin? Is it the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Meliſintha,</hi> that Princeſs, whoſe Fortitude
and Patience have juſtly render'd her the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the whole World? That Princeſs,

and Chains with a marvellous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy;
and who, when ſhe enſlaved her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
and given Fetters to the Prince who
held her Father and herſelf in Bonds, nobly
refus'd the Diadem he proffer'd her, and devoted
herſelf to Deſtruction, in order to puniſh the
Enemy of her Houſe. I am not able to relate
the reſt of her Hiſtory, ſeeing I have read no
further myſelf; but if you will be pleaſed to
ſit down and liſten to me while I read what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
I am perſuaded you will find new Cauſe

               <p>Pardon me, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I
have heard enough; and I could have been
very well ſatisfy'd not to have heard ſo much.
I think we waſte a great deal of Time talking

               <p>Aye, aye, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> the learned
Mr. <hi>Selvin;</hi> I aſſure you, he had almoſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd

               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0005700702:169"/>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> at this Intelligence, caſting down
her Eyes, diſcover'd many Signs of Anger and
Confuſion: And after a Silence of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
during which, Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> had been
employ'd in adjuſting her Dreſs at the Glaſs,
addreſſing herſelf to her Couſin with an Accent
ſomewhat leſs ſweet than before.</p>
               <p>Had any other than yourſelf, Miſs, ſaid ſhe,
acquainted me with the Preſumption of that
unfortunate Perſon, I ſhould haply have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
my Reſentment in other Terms: But, as
it is, muſt inform you, that I take it extremely
ill, you ſhould be acceſſary to giving me this
Offence.</p>
               <p>Hey day! ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> turning about
haſtily, How have I offended your Ladyſhip,
pray?</p>
               <p>I am willing to hope, Couſin, reply'd <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
that it was only to divert yourſelf with
the Trouble and Confuſion in which you ſee
me, that you have indiſcreetly told Things
which ought to have been bury'd in Silence.</p>
               <p>And what is all this mighty Trouble and
Confuſion about then, Madam, ſaid Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> ſmiling? Is it becauſe I told you,
Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> was a Lover of your Ladyſhip?</p>
               <p>Certainly, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſuch an Information
is ſufficient to give one a great deal of Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Is it ſuch a little Matter, think you, to
be told that a Man has the Preſumption to love
one?</p>
               <p>A meer Trifle, reply'd Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
a hundred Lovers are not worth a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Thought, when one's ſure of them, for
then the Trouble is all over. And as for this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0005700702:170"/>
unfortunate Perſon, as your Ladyſhip called
him, let him die at his Leiſure, while we go
to the Parade.</p>
               <p>Your Levity, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> forces
me to ſmile, notwithſtanding the Cauſe I have
to be incens'd; however, I have Charity enough
to make me not deſire the Death of Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi>
who may repair the Crime he has been guilty
of by Repentance and Diſcontinuation.</p>
               <p>Well then, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to go to the Parade: Shall I reach you
your odd Kind of Capuchin?</p>
               <p>How, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> can I with any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
ſee a Man who has diſcover'd himſelf to
have a Paſſion for me? Will he not conſtrue
ſuch a Favour into a Permiſſion for him to
hope?</p>
               <p>Oh! no, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> he does
not imagine I have told your Ladyſhip he loves
you; for indeed he don't know that I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his Paſſion.</p>
               <p>Then he is leſs culpable than I thought him,
reply'd <hi>Arabella;</hi> and if you think I am in no
Danger of hearing a Confeſſion of his Fault
from his own Mouth, I'll comply with your
Requeſt, and go with you to the Parade. But
added ſhe, I muſt firſt engage you to promiſe
not to leave me alone a Moment, leſt he ſhould
take Advantage of ſuch an Opportunity, to
give ſome Hint of his Paſſion, that would force
me to treat him very rigorouſly.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> anſwer'd laughing, That ſhe
would be ſure to mind her Directions. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſaid ſhe, your Ladyſhip need not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
he will ſay any fine Things to you;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0005700702:171"/>
for I knew a young Lady he was formerly in
Love with, and the odious Creature viſited her
a Twelve-month before he found Courage
enough to tell her ſhe was handſome.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> he was much
to be commended for his Reſpect. A Lover
ſhould never have the Preſumption to declare
his Paſſion to his Miſtreſs, unleſs in certain
Circumſtances, which may at the ſame Time
in part diſarm her Anger. For Inſtance, he
muſt ſtruggle with the Violence of his Paſſion,
till it has caſt him into a Fever. His Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
muſt give him over, pronouncing his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
incurable, ſince the Cauſe of it being
in his Mind, all their Art is incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
it. Thus he muſt ſuffer, rejoicing at
the Approach of Death, which will free him
from all his Torments, without violating the
Reſpect he owes to the Divine Object of his
Flame. At length, when he has but a few
Hours to live, his Miſtreſs, with many Signs
of Compaſſion, conjures him to tell her the
Cauſe of his Deſpair. The Lover, conſcious
of his Crime, evades all her Inquiries; but the
Lady laying at laſt a peremptory Command
upon him to diſcloſe the Secret, he dares not
diſobey her, and acknowledges his Paſſion with
the utmoſt Contrition for having offended her;
bidding her take the ſmall Remainder of his
Life to expiate his Crime; and finiſhes his
Diſcourſe by falling into a Swoon.</p>
               <p>The Lady is touch'd at his Condition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him to live, and if neceſſary, permits
him to hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0005700702:172"/>
This is the moſt common Way in which
ſuch Declarations are, and ought to be brought
about. However, there are others, which are
as well calculated for ſparing a Lady's Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and deprecating her Wrath.</p>
               <p>The Lover, for Example, like the Prince
of the <hi>Maſſage<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,</hi> after having buried his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in Silence for many Years, may chance to
be walking with his Confidant in a retir'd
Place; to whom, with a Deluge of Tears, he
relates the Exceſs of his Paſſion and Deſpair.
And while he is thus unboſoming his Griefs,
not in the leaſt ſuſpecting he is overheard, his
Princeſs, who had been liſtning to him in much
Trouble and Confuſion, by ſome little Ruſtling
ſhe makes, unawares diſcovers herſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſurpriz'd Lover throws himſelf at her
Feet, begs Pardon for his Raſhneſs, obſerves
that he had never preſum'd to diſcover his
Paſſion to her; and implores her Leave to die
before her, as a Puniſhment for his undeſign'd
Offence.</p>
               <p>The Method which the great <hi>Artamenes</hi> took
to let the Princeſs of <hi>Media</hi> know he adored
her, was not leſs reſpectful. This valiant Prince,
who had long loved her, being to fight a great
Battle, in which he had ſome ſecret Preſages he
ſhould fall, which however deceiv'd him, wrote
a long Letter to the divine <hi>Mandana,</hi> wherein
he diſcover'd his Paſſion, and the Reſolution his
Reſpect had inſpir'd him with, to conſume in
Silence, and never preſume to diſcloſe his Love
while he lived; acquainting her, that he had
order'd that Letter not to be deliver'd to her,
till it was certainly known that he was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0005700702:173"/>
Accordingly he receiv'd ſeveral Wounds in
the Fight, which brought him to the Ground,
and his Body not being found, they concluded
it was in the Enemy's Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>His faithful 'Squire, who had receiv'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
before the Battle, haſtens to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
who, with all the Court, is mightily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
at his Death.</p>
               <p>He preſents her the Letter, which ſhe makes
no Scruple to receive, ſince the Writer is no
more. She reads it, and her whole Soul is
melted with Compaſſion; ſhe bewails his Fate
with the moſt tender and affectionate Marks of
Grief.</p>
               <p>Her Confidant asks why ſhe is ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
ſince in all Probability, ſhe would not
have pardon'd him for loving her, had he been
alive?</p>
               <p>She acknowledges the Truth of her Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
takes Notice that his Death having can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd
his Crime, his reſpectful Paſſion alone
employs her Thoughts; ſhe is reſolv'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
as innocent and worthy of Compaſſion
when dead, whom living ſhe would treat as a
Criminal, and inſinuates, that her Heart had
entertain'd an Affection for him.</p>
               <p>Her Confidant treaſures up this Hint, and
endeavours to conſole her, but in vain, till News
is brought, that <hi>Artamenes,</hi> who had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
for dead out of the Field, and by a very
ſurprizing Adventure conceal'd all this Time,
is return'd.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs is cover'd with Confuſion, and
tho' glad he is alive, reſolves to baniſh him for
his Crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0005700702:174"/>
Her Confidant pleads his Cauſe ſo well, that
ſhe conſents to ſee him; and, ſince he can no
longer conceal his Paſſion, he confirms the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
in his Letter, humbly begging Pardon
for being ſtill alive.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs, who cannot plead Ignorance
of his Paſſion, nor deny the Sorrow ſhe teſtify'd
for his Death, condeſcends to pardon him, and
he is alſo permitted to hope. In like Manner
the great Prince of <hi>Perſia</hi>—</p>
               <p>Does your Ladyſhip conſider how late it is,
interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who had hitherto
very impatiently liſten'd to her? Don't let us
keep the Gentlemen waiting any longer for us.</p>
               <p>I muſt inform you how the Prince of <hi>Perſia</hi>
declar'd his Love for the incomparable <hi>Berenice,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Time, dear Couſin, ſaid Miſs
<hi>Glanville;</hi> methinks we have talk'd long enough
upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry the Time has ſeem'd ſo tedious to
you, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſmiling; and therefore I'll
treſpaſs no longer upon your Patience. Then
ordering <hi>Lucy</hi> to bring her Hat and Gloves, ſhe
went down Stairs, follow'd by Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
who was greatly diſappointed at her not putting
on her Veil.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS ſoon as the Ladies enter'd the Room,
Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> with more Gaiety than uſual,
advanc'd towards <hi>Arabella,</hi> who put on ſo cold
and ſevere a Countenance at his Approach, that
the poor Man, extreamly confus'd, drew back,
and remain'd in great Perplexity, fearing he had
offended her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> ſeeing Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi>'s Reception,
and aw'd by the becoming Majeſty in her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
notwithſtanding all his Aſſurance, accoſted
her with leſs Confidence than was his Cuſtom;
but <hi>Arabella</hi> ſoftning her Looks with the moſt
engaging Smiles, made an Apology for detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them ſo long from the Parade, gave her
Hand to the Beau, as being not a ſuſpected
Perſon, and permitted him to lead her out.
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> to whom ſhe always allow'd the
Preference on thoſe Occaſions, being a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd,
and not able to attend her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> whoſe Vanity was greatly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
by the Preference <hi>Arabella</hi> gave him to
his Companion, proceeded according to his
uſual Cuſtom, to examine her Looks and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
with more Care; conceiving ſuch a
Preference muſt proceed from a latent Motive
which was not unfavourable for him. His
Diſcernment on theſe Occaſions being very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0005700702:176"/>
he ſoon diſcover'd in the bright Eyes of
<hi>Arabella</hi> a ſecret Approbation of his Perſon,
which he endeavour'd to increaſe by diſplaying
it with all the Addreſs he was Maſter of, and
did not fail to talk her into an Opinion of his
Wit, by ridiculing every Body that paſs'd them,
and directing ſeveral ſtudy'd Compliments to
herſelf.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was not ſo agreeably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
by the grave Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> ſaw theſe
Advances to a Gallantry with her Couſin with
great Diſturbance: She was reſolved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
it if poſſible, and being convinc'd
Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> preferr'd <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Converſation to
hers, ſhe plotted how to pair them together,
and have the Beau to herſelf.</p>
               <p>As they walk'd a few Paces behind her Couſin
and Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> ſhe was in no Danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-heard; and taking Occaſion to put
Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> in mind of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Behaviour to
him, when he accoſted her; ſhe ask'd him, if
he was conſcious of having done any thing to
offend her?</p>
               <p>I proteſt, Madam, reply'd Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> I know
not of any thing I have done to diſpleaſe her.
I never fail'd, to my Knowledge, in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
towards her Ladyſhip, for whom indeed
I have a moſt profound Veneration.</p>
               <p>I know ſo much of her Temper, reſum'd
Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> as to be certain, if ſhe has taken
it into her Head to be angry with you, ſhe will
be ten times more ſo at your Indifference: And
if you hope for her Favour, you muſt ask her
Pardon with the moſt earneſt Submiſſion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0005700702:177"/>
If I knew I had offended her, reply'd
Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> I would very willingly ask her Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
but really, ſince I have not been guilty
of any Fault towards her Ladyſhip, I don't
know how to acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> coldly, I only
took the Liberty to give you ſome friendly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which you may follow, or not, as you
pleaſe. I know my Couſin is angry at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and I wiſh you were Friends again,
that's all.</p>
               <p>I am mightily oblig'd to you, Madam, ſaid
Mr. <hi>Selvin;</hi> and ſince you aſſure me her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is angry, I'll ask her Pardon, tho', really,
as I ſaid before, I don't know for what.</p>
               <p>Well, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> we'll join
them at the End of the Parade; and to give
you an Opportunity of ſpeaking to my Couſin,
I'll engage Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> myſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> who thought himſelf greatly
oblig'd to Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> for her good Intentions,
tho' in reality ſhe had a View of expoſing of
her Couſin, as well as an Inclination to engage
Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> took Courage as they turn'd, to get
on the other Side of <hi>Arabella,</hi> whom he had not
dar'd before to approach, while Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
addreſſing a Whiſper of no great Importance to
her Couſin, parted her from the Beau, and
ſlackning her Pace a little, fell into a particular
Diſcourſe with him, which <hi>Arabella</hi> being too
polite to interrupt, remain'd in a very perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Situation, dreading every Moment that
Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> would explain himſelf. Alarm'd at
his Silence, yet reſolv'd to interrupt him if he
began to ſpeak, and afraid of beginning a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0005700702:178"/>
firſt, leſt he ſhould conſtrue it to his
Advantage.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> being naturally timid in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Ladies, the Circumſtance of Diſgrace
which he was in with <hi>Arabella,</hi> her Silence and
Reſerve ſo added to his accuſtom'd Diffidence,
that tho' he endeavour'd ſeveral times to ſpeak,
he was not able to bring out any thing but a
preluding Hem; which he obſerv'd, to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Confuſion, ſeem'd always to encreaſe
<hi>Arabella</hi>'s Conſtraint.</p>
               <p>Indeed, that Lady, upon any Suſpicion that
he was going to break his myſterious Silence,
always contracted her Brow into a Frown, caſt
down her Eyes with an Air of Perplexity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to hide her Bluſhes with her Fan;
and to ſhew her In-attention, directed her Looks
to the contrary Side.</p>
               <p>The Lady and Gentleman being in equal
Confuſion, no Advances were made on either
Side towards a Converſation, and they had
reach'd almoſt the End of the Parade in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
Silence; when Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> fearing he
ſhould never again have ſo good an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of making his Peace, collected all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and with an Accent trembling under
the Importance of the Speech he was going to
make, began,</p>
               <p>Madam, Since I have had the Honour of
walking with your Ladyſhip, I have obſerved
ſo many Signs of Conſtraint in your Manner,
that I hardly dare intreat you to grant me a
Moment's Hearing while I—</p>
               <p>Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> before you go any
further, I muſt inform you, that what you are
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0005700702:179"/>
going to ſay will mortally offend me. Take
heed then how you commit an Indiſcretion
which will force me to treat you very rigorouſly.</p>
               <p>If your Ladyſhip will not allow me to ſpeak
in my own Juſtification, ſaid Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> yet I
hope you will not refuſe to tell me my Offence,
ſince I—</p>
               <p>You are very confident, indeed, interrupted
<hi>Arabella,</hi> again, to ſuppoſe I will repeat what
would be infinitely grievous for me to hear.
Againſt my Will, purſued ſhe, I muſt give you
the Satisfaction to know, that I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of your Crime, but I alſo aſſure you that I
am highly incens'd; and that, not only with the
Thoughts you have dar'd to entertain of me,
but likewiſe with your Preſumption in going
about to diſcloſe them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> whom the ſeeming Contradictions
in this Speech aſtoniſh'd, yet imagin'd in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
it hinted at the Diſpute between him and
Mr. <hi>Tinſel;</hi> and ſuppoſing the Story had been
told to his Diſadvantage, which was the Cauſe
of her Anger, reply'd in great Emotion at the
Injuſtice done him.</p>
               <p>Since ſomebody has been ſo officious to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your Ladyſhip with an Affair which
ought to have been kept from your Knowledge;
'tis a Pity they did not inform you, that
Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> was the Perſon that had the leaſt
Reſpect for your Ladyſhip, and is more worthy
of your Reſentment.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> is guilty of
an Offence like yours, yet ſince he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
it better, he is leſs culpable than you;
and you have done that for him, which haply
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0005700702:180"/>
he would never have had Courage enough to do
for himſelf as long as he lived.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Selvin,</hi> quite confounded at theſe intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Words, would have begg'd her to explain
herſelf, had ſhe not ſilenc'd him with a dreadful
Frown: Aand making a Stop till Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> came up to them. She told her
Couſin with a peeviſh Accent, that ſhe had
perform'd her Promiſe very ill; and whiſper'd
her, that ſhe was to blame for all the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
ſhe had ſuffer'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> ſuppoſing the Alteration in
<hi>Arabella</hi>'s Humour proceeded from being ſo long
depriv'd of his Company; endeavour'd to make
her Amends by a Profuſion of Compliments;
which ſhe receiv'd with ſuch an Air of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
that the Beau, vex'd at the ill Succeſs of
his Gallantry, told her, he was afraid Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s
Gravity had infected her Ladyſhip.</p>
               <p>Say rather, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> that his Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
has offended me.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> charm'd with this beginning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
which confirm'd his Hopes of having
made fome Impreſſion on her Heart; conjur'd
her very earneſtly to tell him how Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi>
had offended her.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſufficient, reſum'd ſhe, that I tell you
he has offended me, without declaring the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Crime, ſince doubtleſs it has not
eſcaped your Obſervation, which, if I may
believe him, is not wholly diſintereſted. To
confeſs yet more, 'tis true that he hath told me
ſomething concerning you, which—</p>
               <p>Let me periſh, Madam, interrupted the
Beau, if one Syllable he has ſaid be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0005700702:181"/>
How, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> a little diſconcerted,
Will you always perſiſt in a Denial then?</p>
               <p>Deny it, Madam, return'd Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> I'll
deny what he has ſaid with my laſt Breath; 'tis
all a ſcandalous Forgery: No Man living is leſs
likely to think of your Ladyſhip in that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
If you knew my Thoughts, Madam,
you would be convinc'd nothing is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
and—</p>
               <p>Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> extremely morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
methinks you are very eager in your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.
I promiſe you, I do not think you
guilty of the Offence he charg'd you with; if
I did, you would haply experience my Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in ſuch a Manner, as would make you
repent of your Preſumption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> in finiſhing theſe Words, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi>
to tell her, ſhe deſir'd to return Home; to

I do really admire your great Skill in Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems,

'Faith, I don't know how it is, but I am very

which your Lady muſt be acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Since you aſſure me it is not a Love-Letter,
I'll take it, ſaid <hi>Lucy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, pray take mine too, ſaid <hi>Tinſel</hi>'s <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi>
for I aſſure you, it is not a Love-Letter
neither; it's only a <hi>Billet-doux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are you ſure of that, reply'd <hi>Lucy;</hi> becauſe
I may venture to take it, I fancy, if its what
you ſay.</p>
               <p>I'll ſwear it, ſaid the Man delivering it to
her. Well, ſaid ſhe, receiving it, I'll take
them both up. But what did you call this,
purſu'd ſhe? I muſt not forget it, or elſe my
Lady will think it a Love-Letter.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Billet-doux,</hi> ſaid the Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> for fear ſhe ſhould forget it, repeated
the Words <hi>Billet-doux</hi> ſeveral Times as ſhe went
up Stairs; but entering her Lady's Apartment,
ſhe perceiving the Letters in her Hand, ask'd
her ſo ſternly, how ſhe durſt preſume to bring
them into her Preſence, that the poor Girl, in
her Fright, forgot the Leſſon ſhe had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and endeavouring to recal it into her
Memory, took no Notice of her Lady's Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
which ſhe repeated ſeveral times, but to
no Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſurpriz'd at her in-attention, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
her Commands, in a Tone ſomewhat
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0005700702:185"/>
louder than uſual; asking her at the ſame Time,
why ſhe did not obey her immediately?</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, reply'd <hi>Lucy,</hi> your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
would not order me to take back the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if you knew what they were: They are
not Love-Letters; I was reſolv'd to be ſure of
that before I took them. This, Madam, is a
Letter about Buſineſs of Conſequence; and the
other—Oh dear! I can't think what the
Man call'd it! But it is not a Love-Letter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Madam.</p>
               <p>You are a ſimple Wench, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi>
ſmiling: You may depend upon it, all Letters
directed to me, muſt contain Matters of Love
and Gallantry; and thoſe I am not permitted
to receive. Take them away then immediately.
But ſtay, purſued ſhe, ſeeing ſhe was about to
obey her, one of them, you ſay, was deliver'd
to you as a Letter of Conſequence; perhaps i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
is ſo: Indeed it may contain an Advertiſement
of ſome Deſign to carry me away. How do I
know, but Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> incited by his Love and
Deſpair, may intend to make ſuch an Attempt.
Give me that Letter, <hi>Lucy,</hi> I am reſolved to
open it. As for the other—yet who knows
but the other may alſo bring me Warning of
the ſame Danger from another Quarter. The
Pains Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> took to conceal his Paſſion,
nay, almoſt as I think, to deny it, amounts to
a Proof that he is meditating ſome Way to
make ſure of me. 'Tis certainly ſo: Give me
that Letter, <hi>Lucy;</hi> I ſhould be acceſſary to
their intended Violence, if I neglected this
timely Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0005700702:186"/>
Well, cried ſhe, taking one of the Letters,
this is exactly like what happen'd to the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Princeſs of <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> who, like me, in
one and the ſame Day, receiv'd Advice that
two of her Lovers intended to carry her off.</p>
               <p>As ſhe pronounc'd theſe Words Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
enter'd the Room, to whom <hi>Arabella</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
recounted the Adventure of the Letters;
telling her, ſhe did not doubt, but they contain'd
a Diſcovery of ſome Conſpiracy to carry her
away.</p>
               <p>And whom does your Ladyſhip ſuſpect of ſuch
a ſtrange Deſign, pray, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
ſmiling?</p>
               <p>At preſent, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> the two Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
who walk'd with us to Day, are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who ſeem the moſt likely to attempt that
Violence.</p>
               <p>I dare anſwer for Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> replied Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> he thinks of no ſuch Thing.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> to convince you of your
Miſtake, I muſt inform you, that Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi>
having the Preſumption to begin a Declaration
of Love to me on the Parade this Morning, I
reprov'd him ſeverely for his Want of Reſpect,
and threatned him with my Diſpleaſure; in the
Rage of his Jealouſy, at ſeeing me treat
Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> well, he diſcover'd to me, that he
alſo was as criminal as himſelf, in order to
oblige me to a ſeverer Uſage of him.</p>
               <p>So he told you Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> was in Love with
you, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He told it me in other Words, reply'd <hi>Arabella;</hi>
for he ſaid, Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> was guilty of that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
which I reſented ſo ſeverely to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0005700702:187"/>
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> beginning to comprehend the
Myſtery, with great Difficulty forbore laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at her Couſin's Miſtake; for ſhe well knew
the Offence Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> hinted at, and deſirous
of knowing what thoſe Letters contain'd, ſhe
begg'd her to delay opening them no longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> pleas'd at her Solicitude, open'd
one of the Letters; but glancing her Eye to
the Bottom, and ſeeing the Name of <hi>Selvin,</hi>
ſhe threw it haſtily upon the Table, and avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Eyes, What a Mortification have I
avoided, ſaid ſhe, that Letter is from <hi>Selvin;</hi>
and queſtionleſs, contains an Avowal of his
Crime.</p>
               <p>Nay, you muſt read it, cried Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
taking it up; ſince you have open'd it, its the
ſame Thing: You can never perſuade him but
you have ſeen it. However, to ſpare your
Nicety, I'll read it to you. Which accordingly
ſhe did, and found it as follows.</p>

My Thoughts of your Ladyſhip are very

               <p>How's this, cry'd Miſs <hi>Glanville?</hi> Why,
Madam, you are certainly miſtaken. You ſee
Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> utterly denies the Crime of loving
you. He has ſuffer'd very innocently in your
Opinion. Indeed, your Ladyſhip was too haſty
in condemning him.</p>
               <p>If what he ſays be true, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi>
who had been in extream Confuſion, while a
Letter ſo different from what ſhe expected was
reading; I have indeed unjuſtly condemn'd
him. Nevertheleſs, I am ſtill inclin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this is all Artifice; and that he is really
guilty of entertaining a Paſſion for me.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould he take ſo much Pains to
deny it, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville?</hi> Methinks
that looks very odd.</p>
               <p>Not at all, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were rais'd by recollecting an Adventure in
her Romance, ſimilar to this. Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> has
fallen upon the very ſame Stratagem with <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes;</hi>
who being in Love with the beautiful
<hi>Cleobuline,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Corinth,</hi> took all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
Pains to conceal his Paſſion, in order
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0005700702:189"/>
to be near that fair Princeſs; who would have
baniſh'd him from her Preſence, had ſhe known
he was in Love with her. Nay, he went ſo
far in his Diſſimulation, as to pretend Love to
one of the Ladies of her Court; that his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the Princeſs might be the leſs taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. In theſe Caſes therefore, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
a Man denies his Paſſion, the more
pure and violent it is.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi>'s Paſſion is certainly very
violent, reply'd Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> for he denies it
very reſolutely; and I believe none but your
Ladyſhip would have diſcover'd his Artifice.
But ſhall we not open the other Letter? I have
a ſtrong Notion it comes from <hi>Tinſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that very Reaſon I would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Contents, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi>
You ſee, Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> accuſes him of being guilty
of that Offence which he denies: I ſhall doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
meet with a Confirmation of his Love in
that Letter. Do not, I beſeech you added
ſhe, ſeeing her Couſin preparing to open the
Letter, expoſe me to the Pain of hearing a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
Declaration of Love. Nay, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
ſhe, riſing in great Emotion, if you are
reſolved to perſecute me by reading it, I'll en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to get out of the hearing of it.</p>
               <p>You ſhan't, I declare, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
laughing and holding her, I'll oblige you to
hear it.</p>
               <p>I vow, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi> ſmiling, you
uſe me juſt as the Princeſs <hi>Cleopatra</hi> did the fair
and wiſe <hi>Antonia.</hi> However, if by this you
mean to do any Kindneſs to the unfortunate
Perſon who wrote that Billet, you are greatly
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0005700702:190"/>
miſtaken; ſince, if you oblige me to liſten to
a Declaration of his Crime, you will lay me
under a Neceſſity to baniſh him. A Sentence
he would have avoided, while I remained ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of it.</p>
               <p>To this Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> made no other Reply

Well, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> when
ſhe had read this Epiſtle, I fancy you need not
pronounce a Sentence of Baniſhment upon poor
Mr. <hi>Tinſel;</hi> he ſeems to be quite innocent of
the Offence your Ladyſhip ſuſpects him of.</p>
               <p>Why, really, return'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> bluſhing
with extreme Confuſion at this ſecond Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
I am greatly perplex'd to know
how I ought to act on this Occaſion. I am
much in the ſame Situation with the Princeſs
<hi>Serena.</hi> For you muſt know, this Princeſs—
Here <hi>Lucy</hi> entering, inform'd the Ladies Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was ſerv'd—I ſhall defer till another Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> upon this Interruption,
the Relation of the Princeſs <hi>Serena</hi>'s Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
which you will find, added ſhe, in a low
Voice, bears a very great Reſemblance to mine.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> reply'd, ſhe would hear it
whenever ſhe pleas'd, and then follow'd <hi>Arabella</hi>
to the Dining Room.</p>
               <p>The Cloth was ſcarce remov'd, when
Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> came in. <hi>Arabella</hi> bluſh'd at his
Appearance, and diſcover'd ſo much Perplexity
in her Behaviour, that Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
he had not yet ſufficiently juſtify'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and therefore took the firſt Opportunity
to approach her.</p>
               <p>I ſhall think myſelf very unhappy, Madam,
ſaid he bowing, if the Letter I did myſelf the
Honour to write to you this Morning—</p>
               <p>Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> I perceive you are
going to forget the Contents of that Letter,
and preparing again to offend me by a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Declaration of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0005700702:192"/>
Who I, Madam, reply'd he, in great Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and Confuſion, I-I-I proteſt—tho'
I-I have a very great Reſpect for your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
yet—yet I never preſum'd to—to—to—</p>
               <p>You have preſum'd too much, replied <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
and I ſhould forget what I ow'd to my

Occaſions of offending me.—Know then, I
abſolutely forbid you to appear before me again,
at leaſt, till I am convinc'd you have chang'd
your Sentiments.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe roſe from her Seat, and
making a Sign to him not to follow her, which
indeed he had no Intention to do, ſhe quitted
the Room, highly ſatisfy'd with her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
upon this Occaſion, which was exactly
conformable to the Laws of Romance.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> who had juſt alighted from his
Chair, having a Glimpſe of her, as ſhe paſs'd
to her own Apartment, reſolv'd, if poſſible, to
procure a private Interview; for he did not
doubt but his Billet had done Wonders in his
Favour.</p>
               <p>For that Purpoſe he ventur'd up to her Anti-Chamber,
where he found <hi>Lucy</hi> in waiting,
whom he deſir'd to acquaint her Lady, that he
intreated a Moment's Speech with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> after heſitating a Moment, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
earneſtly at him, replied, Sir, if you'll
promiſe me faithfully, you are not in Love
with my Lady, I'll go and deliver your Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
               <p>Duce take me, ſaid <hi>Tinſel,</hi> if that is not a
very whimſical Condition truly—Pray, my
Dear, how came it into thy little Brain, to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0005700702:193"/>
ſuſpect I was in Love with thy Lady? But,
ſuppoſe I ſhould be in Love with her, what
then?</p>
               <p>Why, then its likely you would die, that's
all, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> without my Lady would be ſo
kind to command you to live.</p>
               <p>I vow thou haſt mighty pretty Notions, Child,
ſaid <hi>Tinſel</hi> ſmiling; haſt thou been reading
any Play-Book lately? But pray, doſt think
thy Lady would have compaſſion on me, if I
was in Love with her? Come, I know thou
art in her Confidence? Haſt thou ever heard
her talk of me? Does ſhe not tell thee all her
Secrets?</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Bell ringing, the Beau ſlipp'd
half a Guinea into her Hand, which <hi>Lucy</hi> not
willing to refuſe, went immediately to her
Lady; to whom, with a trembling Accent,
ſhe repeated Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi>'s Requeſt.</p>
               <p>Imprudent Girl, cried <hi>Arabella,</hi> for I am
loth to ſuſpect thee of Diſloyalty to thy Miſtreſs.
Doſt thou know the Nature and Extent of the
Requeſt thou haſt deliver'd? Art thou ignorant
that the preſumptuous Man whom thou ſolliciteſt
this Favour for, has mortally offended me?</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy</hi> frighted out of
her Wits, I don't ſollicit for him. I ſcorn to do
any ſuch Thing. I would not offend your
Ladyſhip for the World: For, before I would
deliver his Meſſage to your Ladyſhip, I made
him aſſure me, that he was not in Love with
your Ladyſhip.</p>
               <p>That was very wiſely done, indeed, replied
<hi>Arabella,</hi> ſmiling: And do you believe he ſpoke
the Truth?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0005700702:194"/>
Yes, indeed, I am ſure of it, ſaid <hi>Lucy</hi>
eagerly, if your Ladyſhip will but be pleas'd to
ſee him, he is only in the next Room; I dare
promiſe—</p>
               <p>How, interrupted <hi>Arabella!</hi> What have you
done? Have you brought him into my Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then? I proteſt this Adventure is exactly
like what befel the beautiful <hi>Statira,</hi> when, by
a Stratagem of the ſame Kind, <hi>Oroondates</hi> was
introduc'd into her Preſence. <hi>Lucy,</hi> thou art
another <hi>Barſina,</hi> I think; but I hope thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
are not leſs innocent than hers was.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, reply'd <hi>Lucy,</hi> exceſſively
uneaſy at her Lady's Words, I am very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
I am no <hi>Barſina,</hi> as your Ladyſhip calls
me.</p>
               <p>I dare anſwer for thee, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi> ſmiling
at the Turn ſhe gave to her Words, thou art
no <hi>Barſina;</hi> and I ſhould wrong thee very
much to compare thee with that wiſe Princeſs;
for thou art certainly one of the moſt ſimple
Wenches in the World. But ſince thou haſt
gone ſo far, let me know what the unfortunate
Perſon deſires of me; for, ſince I am neither
more rigid, nor pretend to more Virtue than
<hi>Statira,</hi> I may do at leaſt as much for him, as
that great Queen did for <hi>Oroondates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He deſires, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> that your
Ladyſhip would be pleas'd to let him ſpeak with
you.</p>
               <p>Or, in his Words, I ſuppoſe, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi>
he humbly implor'd a Moment's Audience.</p>
               <p>I told your Ladyſhip his very Words, indeed,
Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0005700702:195"/>
I tell thee, Girl, thou art miſtaken, ſaid

               <p>Laſtly, That his Deſpair muſt not prompt

               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy</hi> having received this Meſſage, quitted
the Room haſtily, for fear ſhe ſhould forget it.</p>
               <p>Well, my pretty Ambaſſadreſs, ſaid <hi>Tinſel</hi>
when he ſaw her enter the Anti-Chamber,
Will your Lady ſee me?</p>
               <p>No, Sir, replied <hi>Lucy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, interrupted <hi>Tinſel,</hi> that's kind 'faith,
after waiting ſo long.</p>
               <p>Pray Sir, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> don't put me out ſo; I
ſhall forget what my Lady order'd me to tell
you.</p>
               <p>Oh! I ask your Pardon, Child, ſaid <hi>Tinſel.</hi>
Come, let me hear your Meſſage.</p>
               <p>Sir, ſaid <hi>Lucy</hi> adapting the Solemnity of her
Lady's Accent—My Lady bad me ſay, that ſhe
will grant—No, that ſhe conſents to grant you
a ſhort Dience.</p>
               <p>Audience you would ſay Child, ſaid <hi>Tinſel.</hi>
But how came you to tell me before ſhe would

                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0005700702:196"/>
I vow and proteſt, Sir, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> you have
put all my Lady's Words clean out of my

               <p>Oh, no matter, ſaid <hi>Tinſel,</hi> you have told
me enough: I'll wait upon her directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> who ſaw him making towards the
Door, preſt between it and him; and having
all her Lady's Whims in her Head, ſuppos'd
he was going to carry her away—Poſſeſs'd with
this Thought, ſhe ſcream'd out, Help! Help!
for Heaven's Sake! My Lady willl be carry'd
away!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> hearing this Exclamation of her
Woman's, eccho'd her Screams, tho' with a
Voice infinitely more delicate; and ſeeing <hi>Tinſel,</hi>
who, confounded to the laſt Degree at the
Cries of both the Lady and her Woman, had
got into her Chamber he knew not how,
ſhe gave herſelf over for loſt, and fell back in
her Chair in a Swoon, or ſomething ſhe took
for a Swoon, for ſhe was perſuaded it could
happen no otherwiſe; ſince all Ladies in the
ſame Circumſtances arr terrify'd into a fainting
Fit, and ſeldom recover till they are conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
carried away; and when they awake, find
themſelves many Miles off in the Power of
their Raviſher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi>'s other Women, alarm'd by her
Cries, came running into the Room; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> there, and their Lady ia a Swoon,
concluded ſome very extraordinary Accident
had happen'd.</p>
               <p>What is your Buſineſs here, cry'd they all at
a Time? Is it you that has frighted her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</p>

                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0005700702:197"/>
Devil take me, ſaid <hi>Tinſel</hi> amaz'd, if I can
tell what all this means.</p>
               <p>By this Time Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> and
his Siſter, came running aſtoniſh'd up Stairs.
<hi>Arabella</hi> ſtill continu'd motionleſs in her Chair,
her Eyes clos'd, and her Head reclin'd upon
<hi>Lucy,</hi> who with her other Women, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to recover her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> eagerly ran to her Aſſiſtance,
while Sir <hi>Charles</hi> and his Daughter as eagerly
interrogated Mr. <hi>Tinſel,</hi> who ſtood motionleſs
with Surprize, concerning the Cauſe of her
Diſorder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> then firſt diſcovering ſome Signs
of Life, half open'd her Eyes.</p>
               <p>Inhuman Wretch, cry'd ſhe, with a faint
Voice, ſuppoſing herſelf in the Hands of her
Raviſher, think not thy cruel Violence ſhall
procure thee what thy Submiſſions could not
obtain; and if when thou hadſt only my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
to ſurmount, thou didſt find it ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to overcome my Reſolution, now that by
this unjuſt Attempt, thou haſt added Averſion
to that Indifference, never hope for any Thing
but the moſt bitter Reproaches from me.—</p>
               <p>Why, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles</hi> approaching
her, what's the Matter? Look up, I beſeech
you, no-body is attempting to do you any Hurt;
here's none but Friends about you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> raiſing her Head at the Sound of
her Uncle's Voice, and caſting a confus'd Look
on the Perſons about her,</p>
               <p>May I believe my Senſes? Am I reſcu'd,
and in my own Chamber? To whoſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is my Deliverance owing? Without
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0005700702:198"/>
doubt, 'tis to my Couſin's; but where is he?
Let me aſſure him of my Gratitude.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who had retir'd to a Window
in great Confuſion, as ſoon as he heard her call
for him, came towards her, and in a Whiſper
begg'd her to be compos'd; that ſhe was in no
Danger.</p>
               <p>And pray, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> now you
are a little recover'd, be ſo good to inform us
of the Cauſe of your Fright. What has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to occaſion all this Confuſion?</p>
               <p>How, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> don't you know
then what has happen'd?—Pray how was I
brought again into my Chamber, and by what
Means was I reſcu'd?</p>
               <p>I proteſt, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> I don't know that
you have been out of it.</p>
               <p>Alas, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> I perceive you are
quite ignorant of what has befallen me; nor
am I able to give you any Information: All I
can tell you is, that alarm'd by my Womens
Cries, and the Sight of my Raviſher, who
came into my Chamber, I fainted away, and
ſo faciliated his Enterprize; ſince doubtleſs it
was very eaſy for him to carry me away while
I remain'd in that ſenſeleſs Condition. How I
was reſcu'd, or by whom, one of my Women
can haply inform you; ſince its probable one of
them was alſo forc'd away with me—Oh
Heav'ns! cry'd ſhe, ſeeing <hi>Tinſel,</hi> who all this
while ſtood gazing like one diſtracted; what
makes that impious Man in my Preſence!
What am I to think of this? Am I really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
or no?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0005700702:199"/>
What can this mean, cried Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Tinſel?</hi> Have you, Sir, had any Hand
in frighting my Niece?—</p>
               <p>I, Sir, ſaid <hi>Tinſel!</hi> Let me periſh if ever I
was ſo confounded in my Life: The Lady's
Brain is diſorder'd I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was convinc'd all this
Confuſion was caus'd by ſome of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
uſual Whims, dreaded leſt an Explanation would
the more expoſe her; and therefore told his
Father, that it would be beſt to retire, and leave
his Couſin to the Care of his Siſter and her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
adding, that ſhe was not yet quite reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
and their Preſence did but diſcompoſe
her.</p>
               <p>Then addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Tinſel,</hi> told him
he would wait upon him down Stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> ſeeing them going away together,
and ſuppoſing they intended to diſpute the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of her with their Swords, call'd out to
them to ſtay.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> however, without minding her,
preſs'd Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> to walk down.</p>
               <p>Nay, pray, Sir, ſaid the Beau, let us go in
again; ſhe may grow outrageous if we diſoblige
her.</p>
               <p>Outrageous, Sir, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> do you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
my Couſin is mad?</p>
               <p>Upon my Soul, Sir, replied <hi>Tinſel,</hi> if ſhe is
not mad, ſhe is certainly a little out of her
Senſes, or ſo—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> having reiterated her Commands for
her Lovers to return, and finding they did not
obey her, ran to her Chamber-door, where they
were holding a ſurly Sort of Conference, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0005700702:200"/>
on <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Side, who was horridly out
of Humour.</p>
               <p>I perceive by your Looks. ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi> to
her Couſin, the Deſign you are meditating;
but know that I abſolutely forbid you, by all
the Power I have over you, not to engage in
Combat with my Raviſher here.</p>
               <p>Madam, interrupted <hi>Glanville,</hi> I beſeech you
do not—</p>
               <p>I know, ſaid ſhe, you will object to me the
Examples of <hi>Artamenes, Aronces,</hi> and many
others, who were ſo generous as to promiſe
their Rivals not to refuſe them that Satisfaction
whenever they demanded it—but conſider, you
have not the ſame Obligations to Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> that
<hi>Artamenes</hi> had to the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> or that
<hi>Arances</hi> had to—</p>
               <p>For God's Sake, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> what's
all this to the Purpoſe? Curſe on <hi>Aronces</hi> and
the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> I ſay—</p>
               <p>The Aſtoniſhment of <hi>Arabella</hi> at this intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Speech of her Couſin, kept her for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
immoveable, when Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this Diſcourſe, had been collecting all the
Information he could from <hi>Lucy,</hi> concerning
this perplex'd Affair, came towards <hi>Tinſel,</hi> and
giving him an angry Look, told him, He ſhould
take it well if he forbore viſiting any of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
for the future.</p>
               <p>Oh! Your moſt obedient Servant, Sir, ſaid
<hi>Tinſel:</hi> You expect, I ſuppoſe, I ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
chagrin'd at this Prohibition? But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Soul, I am greatly oblig'd to you. Agad!
I have no great Mind to a Halter: And ſince
this Lady is ſo apt to think People have a Deſign
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0005700702:201"/>
to raviſh her, the wiſeſt Thing a Man can do,
is to keep out of her Way.</p>
               <p>Sir, replied <hi>Glanville,</hi> who had follow'd him
to the Door, I believe there was been ſome little
Miſtake in what has happen'd To-day—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I expect you'll take no unbecoming Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
with the Character of Lady <hi>Bella</hi>—</p>
               <p>Oh! Sir, ſaid <hi>Tinſel,</hi> I give you my Honour
I ſhall always ſpeak of the Lady with the moſt
profound Veneration. She is a moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd,
incomprehenſible Lady: And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
take me, if I think there is her Fellow in
the World—And ſo, Sir, I am your moſt
obedient—</p>
               <p>A Word with you before you go, ſaid
<hi>Glanville</hi> ſtopping him—No more of theſe Sneers
as you value that ſmooth Face of yours, or I'll
deſpoil it of a Noſe.</p>
               <p>Oh! Your humble Servant, ſaid the Beau,
retiring in great Confuſion, with ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Smile and a Grin upon his Countenance,
which he took Care however Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>
ſhould not ſee; who as ſoon as he quitted him
went again to <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Apartment, in order to
prevail upon his Father and Siſter to leave her
a little to herſelf, for he dreaded leſt ſome more
Inſtances of her Extravagance would put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Father's Head, that ſhe was really out of
her Senſes.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi> upon his Entrance,
you have I ſuppoſe, given your Rival his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
I aſſure you this Generoſity is highly
agreeable to me—And herein you imitate the
noble <hi>Artamenes,</hi> who upon a like Occaſion,
acted as you have done. For when Fortune
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0005700702:202"/>
had put the Raviſher of <hi>Mandana</hi> in his Power,
and he became the Vanquiſher of his Rival,
who endeavour'd by Violence to poſſeſs that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Princeſs; this truly generous Hero relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd
the Right he had of diſpoſing of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
and inſtead of ſacrificing his Life to his
juſt and reaſonable Vengeance, he gave a Proof
of his admirable Virtue and Clemency by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing
him in Safety, as you have done. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
added ſhe, I hope you have made him
ſwear upon your Sword, that he will never
make a ſecond Attempt upon my Liberty. I
perceive, purſued ſhe, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſilent, with his Eyes bent on the
Ground, for indeed he was aſham'd to look up;
that you would willingly avoid the Praiſe due
to the heroick Action you have juſt perform'd—
Nay, I ſuppoſe you are reſolv'd to keep it ſecret
if poſſible; yet I muſt tell you, that you will
not eſcape the Glory due to it. Glory is as
neceſſarily the Reſult of a virtuous Action, as
Light is an Effect of the Sun which cauſeth it,
and has no Dependence on any other Cauſe;
ſince a virtuous Action continues ſtill the ſame,
tho' it be done without Teſtimony; and Glory,
which is, as one may ſay born with it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
attends it, tho' the Action be not known.</p>
               <p>I proteſt Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> that's very
prettily ſaid.</p>
               <p>In my Opinion, Sir, purſued <hi>Arabella,</hi> if
any thing can weaken the Glory of a good
Action, its the Care a Perſon takes to make it
known: As if one did not do Good for the
Sake of Good, but for the Praiſe that generally
follows it. Thoſe then that are govern'd by
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0005700702:203"/>
ſo intereſted a Motive, ought to be conſider'd
as ſordid rather than generous Perſons; who
making a Kind of Traffick between Virtue and
Glory, barter juſt ſo much of the one for the
other and expect like other Merchants, to
make Advantage by the Exchange.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was charm'd into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy
at this ſenſible Speech of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s, forgot
in an Inſtant all her Abſurdities. He did not
fail to expreſs his Admiration of her Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in Terms that brought a Bluſh into
her fair Face, and oblig'd her to lay her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
upon him to ceaſe his exceſſive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.
Then making a Sign to them to
leave her alone, Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> who underſtood
her, took his Father and Siſter down Stairs,
leaving <hi>Arabella</hi> with her faithful <hi>Lucy,</hi> whom
ſhe immediately commanded to give her a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of what had happen'd to her from the
Time of her ſwooning till ſhe recover'd.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A Dialogue between Arabella and Lucy,
in which the latter ſeems to have the
Advantage.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHY, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> all I can tell
your Ladyſhip is, that we were all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
frighted, to be ſure, when you faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
eſpecially myſelf; and that we did what
we could to recover you—And ſo accordingly
your Ladyſhip did recover.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0005700702:204"/>
What's this to the Purpoſe, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
perceiving ſhe ſtop'd here? I know that I faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and 'tis alſo very plain that I recover'd
again—I ask you what happen'd to me in the
intermediate Time between my Fainting and
Recovery. Give me a faithful Relation of all
the Accidents, to which by my Fainting I am
quite a Stranger; and which no doubt, are very
conſiderable—</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, replied <hi>Lucy,</hi> I have given
your Ladyſhip a faithful Relation of all I can
remember.</p>
               <p>When, reſum'd <hi>Arabella</hi> ſurpiz'd?—</p>
               <p>This Moment, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, ſure thou dream'ſt Wench, replied

carry'd off? How I was reſcu'd again? And—</p>
               <p>No, indeed, Madam, interrupted <hi>Lucy,</hi> I
don't dream; I never told your Ladyſhip that
you was carry'd off.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> and why doſt thou not
ſatisfy my Curioſity? Is it not fit I ſhould be

Hiſtory?</p>
               <p>I can't indeed, and pleaſe your Ladyſhip,

               <p>Why, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy</hi> ſobbing, I can't
make a Hiſtory of nothing.</p>
               <p>Of nothing, Wench, reſum'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> in
a greater Rage than before: Doſt thou call an
Adventure to which thou was a Witneſs, and
boreſt haply ſo great a Share in, nothing?—An
Adventure which hereafter will make a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0005700702:205"/>
Figure in the Relation of my Life, doſt

               <p>No, indeed I don't, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then, purſued <hi>Arabella,</hi> doſt thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
neglect to relate it? Suppoſe, as there is
nothing more likely, thou wert commanded by
ſome Perſons of conſiderable Quality, or haply
ſome great Princes and Princeſſes, to recount
the Adventures of my Life, would'ſt thou omit
a Circumſtance of ſo much Moment?</p>
               <p>No indeed, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am glad to hear thou art ſo diſcreet, ſaid
<hi>Arabella;</hi> and pray do me the Favour to relate
this Adventure to me, as thou would'ſt do to

               <p>Here, <hi>Arabella</hi> making a full Stop, fix'd her
Eyes upon her Woman, expecting every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhe would begin the deſir'd Narrative—
But finding ſhe continu'd ſilent longer than ſhe
thought was neceſſary for recalling the ſeveral
Circumſtances of the Story into her Mind,</p>
               <p>I find, ſaid ſhe, it will be neceſſary to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of Facts, which ought to be free from all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of Labour and Art; and be told with
that graceful Negligence which is ſo becoming
to Truth.</p>
               <p>This I thought proper to tell you, added ſhe,
that you may not fall into that Miſtake when you

Well, now if you pleaſe to begin—,</p>

               <p>Begone, cried <hi>Arabella</hi> loſing all Patience at
her Obſtinacy, get out of my Preſence this
Moment. Wretch, unworthy of my Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Favour, thy Treaſon is too manifeſt,
thou art brib'd by that preſumptuous Man to
conceal all the Circumſtances of his Attempt
from my Knowleddge, to the End that I may
not have a full Conviction of his Guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> who never ſaw her Lady ſo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
before, and knew not the Occaſion of
it, burſt into Tears; which ſo affected the
tender Heart of <hi>Arabella,</hi> that loſing inſenſibly
all her Anger, ſhe told her with a Voice ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
to a Tone of the utmoſt Sweetneſs and
Condeſcenſion, that provided ſhe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
how far ſhe had been prevail'd upon by his
rich Preſents, to forget her Duty, ſhe would
pardon and receive her again into Favour—</p>
               <p>Speak, added ſhe, and be not afraid after this
Promiſe, to let me know what Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
of thee, and what were the Gifts with
which he purchas'd thy Services: doubtleſs, he
preſented thee with Jewels of a conſiderable
Value—</p>
               <p>Since your Ladyſhip, ſaid <hi>Lucy</hi> ſobbing, has
promis'd not to be angry, I don't care if I do
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0005700702:207"/>
tell your Ladyſhip what he gave me. He gave
me this half Guinea, Madam, indeed he did;
but for all that, when he would come into
your Chamber I ſtruggled with him, and cry'd
out, for fear he ſhould carry your Ladyſhip
away—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> loſt in Aſtoniſhment and Shame at
hearing of ſo inconſiderable a Preſent made to
her Woman, the like of which not one of her
Romances could furniſh her, order'd her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to withdraw, not being willing ſhe

had given her.</p>
               <p>After ſhe had been gone ſome Time, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd

Pleaſure had ſecretly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd
in the Extravagances her
beautiful Couſin had been guilty
of, was now ſenſibly diſappointed
to find they had had ſo little Effect on her Father
and Brother; for inſtead of reflecting upon the
Abſurdities to which they had been a Witneſs,
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> artfully purſu'd the Subject <hi>Arabella</hi>
juſt before had been expatiating upon, taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
frequently of ſome Obſervations of hers, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0005700702:209"/>
by a well contriv'd Repetition of her Words,
oblig'd his Father a ſecond Time to declare that
his Niece had ſpoken extremely well.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> taking the Word, launch'd out
into ſuch Praiſes of her Wit, that Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
no longer able to liſten patiently, reply'd,</p>
               <p>'Twas true Lady <hi>Bella</hi> ſometimes ſaid very
ſenſible Things; that 'twas a great Pity ſhe was
not always in a reaſonable Way of thinking,
or that her Intervals were not longer—</p>
               <p>Her Intervals, Miſs, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> pray
what do you mean by that Expreſſion?—</p>
               <p>Why, pray, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> don't you
think my Couſin is ſometimes a little wrong in
the Head?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> at theſe Words ſtarting from
his Chair, took a Turn a-croſs the Room in
great Diſcompoſure, then ſtopping all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and giving his Siſter a furious Look—
<hi>Charlotte,</hi> ſaid he, don't give me Cauſe to think
you are envious of your Couſin's ſuperior Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies—</p>
               <p>Envious, repeated Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I envious
of my Couſin—I vow I ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uld never have
thought of that—Indeed, Brother, you are
much miſtaken; my Couſin's ſuperior Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
never gave me a Moment's Diſturbance—
Tho' I muſt confeſs her unaccountable Whims
have often excited my Pity—</p>
               <p>No more of this, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> interrupted
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> as you value my Friendſhip—
No more of it—</p>
               <p>Why, really Son, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> my Niece
has very ſtrange Whimſies ſometimes. How
it came into her Head to think Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> would
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0005700702:210"/>
attempt to carry her away, I can't imagine?
For after all, he only preſt rather too rudely
into her Chamber, for which, as you ſee, I
have ferbidden his Viſits.</p>
               <p>That was of a Piece, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
ſneeringly to her Brother, with her asking you
if you had made Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> ſwear upon your
Sword, that he would never again attempt to
carry her away; and applauding you for having
given him his Liberty, as the generous <hi>Atermens</hi>
did on the ſame Occaſion.</p>
               <p>I would adviſe you, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
not to aim at repeating your Couſins's
Words, till you know how to pronounce them
properly.</p>
               <p>Oh! that's one of her ſuperior Excellencies,
ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, Miſs, ſaid <hi>Glanville</hi> very provokingly,
ſhe is ſuperior to you in many Things; and as
much ſo in the Goodneſs of her Heart, as in
the Beauty of her Perſon—</p>
               <p>Come, come, <hi>Charles,</hi> ſaid the Baronet,
who obſerv'd his Daughter ſat ſwelling and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her Lip at this Reproach, perſonal Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are better avoided. Your Siſter is very well,
and not to be diſparag'd; tho' to be ſure, Lady
<hi>Bella</hi> is the fineſt Woman I ever ſaw in my
Life.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> was, if poſſible, more diſguſted
at her Father's Palliation than her Brother's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches;
and in order to give a Looſe to her
Paſſion, accus'd Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> of a Decreaſe in
his Affection for her, ſince he had been in Love
with her Couſin; and having found this Excuſe
for her Tears, very freely gave vent to them—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0005700702:211"/>
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> being ſoftned by this Sight, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
a few Compliments to her Vanity,
which ſoon reſtor'd her to her uſual Tranquillity;
then turning the Diſcourſe on his beloved <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
pronounc'd a Panegyrick on her Virtues
and Accompliſhments of an Hour long; which,
if it did not abſolutely perſuade his Siſter to
change her Opinion, it certainly convinc'd his
Father, that his Niece was not only perfectly
well in her Underſtanding, but even better than
moſt others of her Sex.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> had juſt finiſh'd her Eulogium,
when <hi>Arabella</hi> appear'd; Joy danc'd in his
Eyes at her Approach; he gaz'd upon her with
a Kind of conſcious Triumph in his Looks;
her conſummate Lovelineſs juſtifying his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and being in his Opinion, more than an
Excuſe for all her Extravagancies.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ARABELLA,</hi> who at her Entrance had
perceiv'd ſome Traces of Uneaſineſs upon
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Countenance, tenderly ask'd her
the Cauſe; to which that young Lady anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a cold and reſerv'd Manner, Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
to divert her Reflexions on it, very freely
accus'd himſelf of having given his Siſter ſome
Offence. To be ſure, Brother, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0005700702:212"/>
you are very vehement in your Temper, and
are as violently carry'd away about Things of
little Importance as of the greateſt; and then,
whatever you have a Fancy for, you love ſo
obſtinately.</p>
               <p>I am oblig'd to you, Miſs, interrupted
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> for endeavouring to give Lady
<hi>Bella</hi> ſo unfavourable an Opinion of me—</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> has
ſaid nothing to your Diſadvantage: For, in my
Opinion, the Temperament of great Minds
ought to be ſuch as ſhe repreſents yours to be.
For there is nothing at ſo great a Diſtance from
true and heroick Virtue, as that Indifference
which obliges ſome People to be pleas'd with all
Things or nothing: Whence it comes to paſs,
that they neither entertain great Deſires of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor Fear of Infamy; that they neither love
nor hate; that they are wholly influenc'd by
Cuſtom, and are ſenſible only of the Afflictions
of the Body, their Minds being in a Manner
inſenſible—</p>
               <p>To ſay the Truth, I am inclin'd to conceive
a greater Hope of a Man, who in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Life is hurry'd away by ſome evil
Habit, than one that faſtens on nothing: The
Mind that cannot be brought to deteſt Vice,
will never be perſuaded to love Virtue; but one
who is capable of loving or hating irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
by having, when young, his Paſſions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to proper Objects, will remain fix'd in
his Choice of what is good. But with him who
is incapable of any violent Attraction, and
whoſe Heart is chilled by a general Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Precept or Example will have no Force—
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0005700702:213"/>
And Philoſophy itſelf, which boaſts it hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
for all Indiſpoſitions of the Soul, never
had any that can cure an indifferent Mind—
Nay, added ſhe, I am perſuaded that Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is generally the inſeparable Companion of
a weak and imperfect Judgment. For it is ſo
natural to a Perſon to be carry'd towards that
which he believes to be good, that if indifferent
People were able to judge of Things, they would
faſten on ſomething. But certain it is that this
luke-warmneſs of Soul, which ſends ſorth but
ſeeble Deſires, ſends alſo but feeble Lights; ſo
that thoſe who are guilty of it, not knowing
any thing clearly, cannot faſten on any thing
with Perſeverance.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> when <hi>Arabella</hi> had finiſh'd
this Speech, caſt a triumphing Glance at his
Siſter, who had affected great In-attention all
the while ſhe had been ſpeaking. Sir <hi>Charles</hi>
in his Way, expreſs'd much Admiration of her
Wit, telling her, if ſhe had been a Man, ſhe
would have made a great Figure in Parliament,
and that her Speeches might have come perhaps
to be printed in time.</p>
               <p>This Compliment, odd as it was, gave great
Joy to <hi>Glanville,</hi> when the Converſation was
interrupted by the Arrival of Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> who
had ſlipt away unobſerv'd at the Time that
<hi>Arabella</hi>'s Indiſpoſition had alarm'd them, and
now came to enquire after her Health; and alſo
if an Opportunity offer'd to ſet her right with
Regard to the Suſpicions ſhe had entertain'd of
his deſigning to pay his Addreſſes to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> as ſoon as he had ſent in his Name,
appear'd to be in great Diſturbance; and upon
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0005700702:214"/>
his Entrance, offer'd immediately to withdraw,
telling Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who would have detain'd
her, that ſhe found no Place was likely to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
her from the Perſecutions of that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville</hi> ſtar'd, and look'd ſtrangely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd
at this Speech; Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> ſmil'd,
and poor <hi>Selvin,</hi> with a very ſilly Look—hem'd
two or three times, and then with a faultring
Accent ſaid, Madam, I am very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to find your Ladyſhip reſolv'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in—</p>
               <p>Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> my Reſolutions
are unalterable. I told you ſo before, and am
ſurpriz'd, after the Knowledge of my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
you preſume to appear in my Preſence
again, from whence I had ſo poſitively baniſh'd
you.</p>
               <p>Pray, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> what has
Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> done to diſoblige you?</p>
               <p>Sir, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi>'s Offence
can admit of no other Reparation than that
which I requir'd of him, which was a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Baniſhment from my Preſence: And in
this purſu'd ſhe, I am guilty of no more Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to you, than the Princeſs <hi>Udoſia</hi> was to the
unfortunate <hi>Thraſimedes.</hi> For the Paſſion of
this Prince having come to her Knowledge,
notwithſtanding the Pains he took to conceal it,
this fair and wiſe Princeſs thought it not enough
to forbid his ſpeaking to her, but alſo baniſh'd
him from her Preſence; laying a peremptory
Command upon him, never to appear before
her again till he was perfectly cur'd of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Love he had entertain'd for her—Imitate
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0005700702:215"/>
therefore the meritorious Obedience of this poor
Prince, and if that Paſſion you profeſs for me—</p>
               <p>How, Sir, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> Do you
make Love to my Niece then?—</p>
               <p>Sir, replied Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> who was ſtrangely
confounded at <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Speech, tho' I really
admire the Perfections this Lady is poſſeſs'd of,
yet I aſſure you, upon my Honour, I never had
a Thought of making any Addreſſes to her;
and I can't imagine why her Ladyſhip perſiſts
in accuſing me of ſuch Preſumption.</p>
               <p>So formal a Denial after what <hi>Arabella</hi> had
ſaid, extremely perplex'd Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> and fill'd
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> with inconceivable Shame—</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> enjoy'd their Diſturbance, and
full of an ill-natur'd Triumph, endeavour'd to
look <hi>Arabella</hi> into Confuſion: But that Lady
not being at all diſcompos'd by this Declaration
of Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi>'s, having accounted for it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
replied with great Calmneſs,</p>
               <p>Sir, 'Tis eaſy to ſee thro' the Artifice of your
diſclaiming any Paſſion for me—Upon any other
Occaſion queſtionleſs, you would rather ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
your Life, than conſent to diſavow theſe
Sentiments, which unhappily for your Peace
you have entertain'd. At preſent the Deſire of
continuing near me, obliges you to lay this
Conſtraint upon yourſelf; however you know
<hi>Thraſimedes</hi> fell upon the ſame Stratagem to no
Purpoſe. The rigid <hi>Udoſia</hi> ſaw thro' the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
and would not diſpenſe with herſelf from
baniſhing him from <hi>Rome,</hi> as I do you from
<hi>England</hi>—</p>
               <p>How, Madam! interrupted <hi>Selvin</hi> amaz'd—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0005700702:216"/>
Yes, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella</hi> haſtily, nothing
leſs can ſatisfy what I owe to the Conſideration
of my own Glory.</p>
               <p>Upon my Word, Madam, ſaid <hi>Selvin,</hi> half
angry, and yet ſtrongly inclin'd to laugh, I
don't ſee the Neceſſity of my quitting my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, to ſatisfy what you owe to the
Conſideration of your own Glory. Pray, how
does my ſtaying in <hi>England</hi> affect your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Glory?</p>
               <p>To anſwer your Queſtion with another, ſaid
<hi>Arabella,</hi> Pray how did the Stay of <hi>Thraſimedes</hi>
in <hi>Rome,</hi> affect the Glory of the Empreſs
<hi>Udoſia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> was ſtruck dumb with this Speech,
for he was not willing to be thought ſo deficient
in the Knowledge of Hiſtory, as not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Reaſons why <hi>Thraſimedes</hi>
ſhould not ſtay in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Silence therefore ſeeming to <hi>Arabella</hi> to
be a tacit Confeſſion of the Juſtice of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
a Sentiment of Compaſſion for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Lover, intruded itſelf into her Mind;
and turning her bright Eyes, full of a ſoft Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
upon <hi>Selvin,</hi> who ſtar'd at her as if he
had loſt his Wits—</p>
               <p>I will not, ſaid ſhe, wrong the Sublimity of
your Paſſion for me ſo much, as to doubt your
being ready to ſacrifice the Repoſe of your own
Life to the Satisfaction of mine: Nor will I
do ſo much Injuſtice to your Generoſity, as to
ſuppoſe the Glory of obeying my Commands,
will not in ſome Meaſure ſoften the Rigour of
your Deſtiny—I know not whether it may be
lawful for me to tell you, that your Misfortune
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0005700702:217"/>
does really cauſe me ſome Affliction; but I am
willing to give you this Conſolation, and alſo
to aſſure you, that to whatever Part of the
World your Deſpair will carry you, the good
Wiſhes and Compaſſion of <hi>Arabella</hi> ſhall follow
you—</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this, with one of her fair Hands
ſhe cover'd her Face, to hide the Bluſhes which
ſo compaſſionate a Speech had caus'd—Holding
the other extended with a careleſs Air, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
he would kneel to kiſs it, and bathe it
with his Tears, as was the Cuſtom on ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Occaſions, her Head at the ſamè Time
turned another Way, as if reluctantly and
with Confuſion ſhe granted this Favour.—
But after ſtanding a Moment in this Poſture,
and finding her Hand untouch'd, ſhe concluded
Grief had depriv'd him of his Senſes, and that
he would ſhortly fall into a Swoon as <hi>Thraſime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
did: And to prevent being a Witneſs of ſo
doleful a Sight, ſhe hurry'd out of the Room
without once turning about, and having reach'd
her own Apartment, ſunk into a Chair, not a
little affected with the deplorable Condition in
which ſhe had left her ſuppos'd miſerable Lover.</p>

with her. Upon which Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> obſerv'd,
that it was a Pity there were not ſuch Things
as Proteſtant Nunneries; giving it as her Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that her Couſin ought to be confin'd in
one of thoſe Places, and never ſuffer'd to ſee
any Company, by which Means ſhe would avoid
expoſing herſelf in the Manner ſhe did now.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> who poſſibly thought this a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Scheme of Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s, ſeem'd by
his Silence to aſſent to her Opinion; but Sir
<hi>Charles</hi> was greatly diſpleas'd with his Daughter
for expreſſing herſelf ſo freely; alledging that
<hi>Arabella,</hi> when ſhe was out of thoſe Whims,
was a very ſenſible young Lady, and ſometimes.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0005700702:219"/>
talk'd as learnedly as a Divine. To which
Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> alſo added, that ſhe had a great
Knowledge of Hiſtory, and had a moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
Memory; and after ſome more Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the ſame Purpoſe, he took his Leave,
earneſtly entreating Sir <hi>Charles</hi> to believe that
he never entertain'd any Deſign of making his
Addreſſes to Lady <hi>Bella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean Time, that Lady after having
given near half an Hour to thoſe Reflexions
which occur to Heroines in the ſame Situation
with herſelf, called for <hi>Lucy,</hi> and order'd her
to go to the Dining-Room, and ſee in what
Condition Mr <hi>Selvin</hi> was, telling her ſhe had
certainly left him in a Swoon, as alſo the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of it; and bid her give him all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
in her Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> with Tears in her Eyes at this Recital,
went down as ſhe was order'd, and entering the
Room without any Ceremony, her Thoughts
being wholly fix'd on the melancholy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
her Lady had been telling her; ſhe look'd
eagerly round the Room without ſpeaking a
Word, till Sir <hi>Charles</hi> and Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who
thought ſhe had been ſent with ſome Meſſage
from <hi>Arabella,</hi> ask'd her both at the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
What ſhe wanted?—</p>
               <p>I came, Sir, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> repeating her Lady's
Words, to ſee in what Condition Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> is
in, and to give him all the Solation in my
Power.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> laughing heartily at this Speech,
ask'd her what ſhe could do for Mr. <hi>Selvin?</hi>
To which ſhe reply'd, ſhe did not know; but
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0005700702:220"/>
her Lady had told her to give him all the Sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in her Power.</p>
               <p>Conſolation thou would'ſt ſay, I ſuppoſe, ſaid
Sir <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, Sir, ſaid <hi>Lucy</hi> curteſying. Well, Child,
added he, go up and tell your Lady, Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi>
does not need any Conſolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy</hi> accordingly return'd with this Meſſage,
and was met at the Chamber-Door by <hi>Arabella,</hi>
who haſtily ask'd her if Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from his Swoon: To which <hi>Lucy</hi> reply'd
that ſhe did not know; but that Sir <hi>Charles</hi>
bid her tell her Ladyſhip, Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> did not
need any Conſolation.</p>
               <p>Oh Heavens! cry'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> throwing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into a Chair as pale as Death—He is dead,
he has fallen upon his Sword, and put an End
to his Life and Miſeries at once—Oh! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
am I, cry'd ſhe, burſting into Tears, to
be the Cauſe of ſo cruel an Accident—Was
ever any Fate ſo terrible as mine—Was ever
Beauty ſo fatal—Was ever Rigour ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate—How
will the Quiet of my future Days
be diſturbed by the ſad Remembrance of a Man
whoſe Death was cauſed by my Diſdain—But
why, reſum'd ſhe after a little Pauſe—Why do
I thus afflict myſelf for what has happen'd by an
unavoidable Neceſſity? Nor am I ſingular in
the Misfortune which has befallen me—Did not
the ſad <hi>Perinthus</hi> die for the beautiful <hi>Panthea</hi>—
Did not the Rigour of <hi>Barſina</hi> bring the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Oxyatres</hi> to the Grave—And the Severity
of <hi>Statira</hi> make <hi>Oroondates</hi> fall upon his Sword
in her Preſence, tho' happily he eſcap'd being
kill'd by it—Let us then not afflict ourſelves
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0005700702:221"/>
unreaſonably at this ſad Accident—Let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as we ought the fatal Effects of our
Charms—But let us comfort ourſelves with the
Thought that we have only acted conformable
to our Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> having pronounc'd theſe laſt Words
with a ſolemn and lofty Accent, order'd <hi>Lucy,</hi>
who liſten'd to her with Eyes drown'd in Tears,
to go down and ask if the Body was remov'd—
for added ſhe, all my Conſtancy will not be
ſufficient to ſupport me againſt that pitiful
Sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy</hi> accordinly deliver'd her Meſſage to
Sir <hi>Charles</hi> and Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who were ſtill
together, diſcourſing on the fantaſtical Turn of
<hi>Arabella,</hi> when the Knight, who could not
poſſibly comprehend what ſhe meant by asking
if the Body was removed, bid her tell her Lady
he deſired to ſpeak with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> upon receiving this Summons, ſet
herſelf to conſider what could be the Intent of
it. If Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> be dead, ſaid ſhe, what Good
can my Preſence do among them? Surely it
cannot be to upbraid me with my Severity, that
my Uncle deſires to ſee me—No, it would be
unjuſt to ſuppoſe it. Queſtionleſs my unhappy
Lover is ſtill ſtruggling with the Pangs of Death,
and for a Conſolation in his laſt Moments, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores
the Favour of reſigning up his Life in my
Sight. Pauſing a little at theſe Words, ſhe roſe
from her Seat with a Reſolution to give the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<hi>Selvin</hi> her Pardon before he dy'd. Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> as he was returning from his
Chamber to the Dining-Room, ſhe told him,
ſhe hop'd the Charity ſhe was going to diſcover
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0005700702:222"/>
towards his Rival, would not give him any
Uneaſineſs; and preventing his Reply by going
haſtily into the Room, he follow'd her dreading
ſome new Extravagance, yet not able to prevent
it, endeavour'd to conceal his Confuſion from her
Obſervation—<hi>Arabella</hi> after breathing a gentle
Sigh told told Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> that ſhe was come to
grant Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> her Pardon for the Offence he
had been guilty of, that he might depart in
Peace.</p>
               <p>Well, well, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> he is departed in
Peace without it.</p>
               <p>How, Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> is he dead
then already? Alas! why had he not the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of ſeeing me before he expir'd, that his
Sould might have departed in Peace! He would
have been aſſur'd not only of my Pardon, but
Pity alſo; and that Aſſurance would have made
him happy in his laſt Moments.</p>
               <p>Why, Niece, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles</hi> ſtaring,
you ſurprize me prodigiouſly: Are you in
earneſt?</p>
               <p>Queſtionleſs I am, Sir, ſaid ſhe, nor ought you
to be ſurpriz'd at the Concern I expreſs for the
Fate of this unhappy Man, nor at the Pardon I
propos'd to have granted him; ſince herein I am
juſtified by the Example of many great and
virtuous Princeſſes, who have done as much,
nay, haply more than I intended to have done,
for Perſons whoſe Offences were greater than
Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>I am very ſorry, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
to hear you talk in this Manner: 'Tis really
enough to make one ſuſpect you are—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0005700702:223"/>
You do me great Injuſtice, Sir, interrupted
<hi>Arabella,</hi> if you ſuſpect me to be guilty of any
unbecoming Weakneſs for this Man: If barely
expreſſing my Compaſſion for his Misfortunes
be eſteem'd ſo great a Favour, what would you
have thought if I had ſupported his Head on my
Knees while he was dying, ſhed Tears over
him, and diſcover'd all the Tokens of a ſincere
Affliction for him?—</p>
               <p>Good God! ſaid Sir <hi>Charles</hi> lifting up his
Eyes, Did any body ever hear of any thing like
this?</p>
               <p>What, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> with as great an
Appearance of Surprize in her Countenance as
his had diſcover'd, Do you ſay you never heard
of any thing like this? Then you never heard
of the Princeſs of <hi>Media,</hi> I ſuppoſe—</p>
               <p>No, not I, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles</hi> peeviſhly.</p>
               <p>Then, Sir, reſum'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> permit me to
tell you, that this fair and virtuous Princeſs
condeſcended to do all I have mention'd for the
fierce <hi>Labynet,</hi> Prince of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> who tho' he
had mortally offended her by ſtealing her away
out of the Court of the King her Father, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
when he was wounded to Death in
her Preſence, and humbly implor'd her Pardon
before he died, ſhe condeſcended as I have ſaid,
to ſupport him on her Knees, and ſhed Tears
for his Diſaſter—I could produce many more
Inſtances of the like Compaſſion in Ladies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as highly born as herſelf, tho' perhaps their
Quality was not quite ſo illuſtrious, ſhe being
the Heireſs of two powerful Kingdoms. Yet
to mention only theſe—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0005700702:224"/>
Good Heav'ns! cry'd Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> here,
being quite out of Patience, I ſhall go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> ſurpriz'd at this Exclamation, look'd
earneſtly at him for a Moment—and then ask'd
him, Whether any thing ſhe had ſaid had given
him Uneaſineſs?</p>
               <p>Yes, upon my Soul, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glanville</hi>
ſo vex'd and confus'd that he hardly knew what
he ſaid—</p>
               <p>I am ſorry for it, reply'd <hi>Arabella</hi> gravely,
and alſo am greatly concern'd to find that in
Generoſity you are ſo much exceeded by the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
<hi>Cyrus;</hi> who was ſo far from taking
Umbrage at <hi>Mandana</hi>'s Behaviour to the dying
Prince, that he commended her for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
ſhe had ſhewn him. So alſo did the
brave and generous <hi>Oroondates,</hi> when the fair
<hi>Statira</hi>—</p>
               <p>By Heav'ns! cry'd <hi>Glanville</hi> riſing in a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
there's no hearing this. Pardon me,
Madam, but upon my Soul, you'll make me
hang myſelf.</p>
               <p>Hang yourſelf, repeated <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſure you
know not what you ſay?—You meant, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that you'll fall upon your Sword. What
Hero ever threatned to give himſelf ſo vulgar
a Death? But pray let me know the Cauſe of
your Deſpair, ſo ſudden and ſo violent.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> continuing in a ſort of ſullen
Silence, <hi>Arabella</hi> raiſing her Voice went on:</p>
               <p>Tho' I do not conceive myſelf oblig'd to give
you an Account of my Conduct, ſeeing that I
have only permitted you yet to hope for my
Favour; yet I owe to myſelf and my own
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0005700702:225"/>
Honour the Juſtification I am going to make.
Know then, that however ſuſpicious my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for Mr. <hi>Selvin</hi> may appear to your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
Judgment, yet it has its Foundation
only in the Generoſity of my Diſpoſition, which
inclines me to pardon the Fault when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Criminal repents; and to afford him my
Pity when his Circumſtances require it. Let
not therefore the Charity I have diſcover'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your Rival, be the Cauſe of your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
ſince my Sentiments for him were he
living, would be what they were before; that
is, full of Indifference, nay, haply Diſdain.
And ſuffer not yourſelf to be ſo carried away
by a violent and unjuſt Jealouſy, as to threaten
your won Death, which if you really had any
Ground for your Suſpicions, and truly lov'd me,
would come unſought for, tho' not undeſir'd—
For indeed, was your Deſpair reaſonable, Death
would neceſſarily follow it; for what Lover can
live under ſo deſperate a Misfortune. In that
Caſe you may meet Death undauntedly when it
comes, nay, embrace it with Joy; but truly
the killing one's ſelf is but a falſe Picture of true
Courage, proceeding rather from Fear of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Evil, than Contempt of that you fly to:
For if it were a Contempt of Pain, the ſame
Principle would make you reſolve to bear pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
and fearleſly all kind of Pains; and
Hope being of all other the moſt contrary Thing
to Fear, this being an utter Baniſhment of Hope,
ſeems to have its Ground in Fear.</p>

made a Sign for that Purpoſe; and throwing

greatly ſurprizing Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſhe preſt her
to tell her the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Alas! reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> have I not Cauſe to

Death of Mr. <hi>Selvin,</hi> the Deſpair to which

               <p>'Tis impoſſible, Sir, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Nature of Things, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

You know the Rigour of my Sentence, you

               <p>He denies that, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> and

                  <hi>Arabella</hi>'s apparent Confuſion at theſe Words
giving Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> Hopes that he had fallen
upon a proper Method to cure her of ſome of
her ſtrange Notions, he was going to purſue his
Arguments, when <hi>Arabella</hi> looking a little
ſternly upon him,</p>
               <p>The Empire of Love, ſaid ſhe, like the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of Honour, is govern'd by Laws of its
own, which have no Dependence upon, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to any other.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to differ from you. Our Laws have fix'd
the Boundaries of Honour as well as thoſe of
Love.</p>
               <p>How is that poſſible, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> when
they differ ſo widely, that a Man may be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
by the one, and yet condemn'd by the
other? For Inſtance, purſued ſhe, you are not
permitted by the Laws of the Land to take
away the Life of any Perſon whatever; yet the
Laws of Honour oblige you to hunt your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
thro' the World, in order to ſacrifice him
to your Vengeance. Since it is impoſſible then
for the ſame Actions to be at once juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the Law
which condemns it, and that which juſtifies it
is not the ſame, but directly oppoſite—And
now, added ſhe, after a little Pauſe, I hope I
have entirely clear'd up that Point to you.</p>
               <p>You have indeed, Madam, reply'd Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
proved to a Demonſtration, that what
is called Honour is ſomething diſtinct from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
ſince they command Things abſolutely
oppoſite to each other.</p>

                  <hi>Arabella</hi> without reflecting on this Inference,
went on to prove the independent Sovereignty
of Love, which, ſaid ſhe, may be collected
from all the Words and Actions of thoſe Heroes
who were inſpir'd by this Paſſion. We ſee it
in them, purſued ſhe, triumphing not only over
all natural and avow'd Allegiance, but ſuperior
even to Friendſhip, Duty, and Honour itſelf.
This the Actions of <hi>Oroondates, Artaxerxes,
Spitridates,</hi> and many other illuſtrious Princes
ſufficiently teſtify.</p>
               <p>Love requires a more unlimited Obedience
from its Slaves, than any other Monarch can

is circumſcrib'd by no Laws whatever, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
upon nothing but itſelf.</p>
               <p>I ſhall live, Madam, ſays the renowned

               <argument>
                  <p>In which is introduc'd a very ſingular
Character.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MISS <hi>Glanville,</hi> whoſe Envy and Diſlike
of her lovely Couſin was heighten'd by
her Suſpicions that ſhe diſputed with her the
Poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Heart, ſhe having
been long in reality a great Admirer of that gay
Gentleman, was extremely delighted with the
Ridicule her abſurd Behaviour had drawn upon
her at <hi>Bath,</hi> which ſhe found by Enquiry was
thro' Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi>'s Repreſentation grown almoſt
general.</p>
               <p>In order therefore to be at Liberty to go to the
Publick Places un-eclips'd by the ſuperior Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſhe acquainted her Father and
Brother with Part of what ſhe had heard, which
determin'd them to prevent that young Lady's
Appearance in Publick while they ſtaid at <hi>Bath;</hi>
this being no difficult Matter to bring about,
ſince <hi>Arabella</hi> only went to the Rooms or Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rade
in Compliance with the Invitation of her
Couſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0005700702:231"/>
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> being by theſe Means rid of a
Rival too powerful even to contend with, went
with more than uſual Gaiety to the Aſſembly,
where the Extravagancies of <hi>Arabella</hi> afforded
a perpetual Fund for Diverſion. Her more
than paſſive Behaviour upon this Occaſion, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
all Reſtraint among thoſe ſhe convers'd
with, the Jeſt circulated very freely at <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
Expence. Nor did Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> fail to give
new Poignancy to their Sarcaſms, by artfully
diſcloſing the bent of her Couſin's Studies, and
enumerating the many Abſurdities they had
made her guilty of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi>'s uncommon Beauty had gain'd her
ſo many Enemies among the Ladies that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
this Aſſembly, that they ſeem'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with each other who ſhould ridicule her
moſt. The celebrated Counteſs of—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then at <hi>Bath,</hi> approach'd a Circle of theſe
fair Defamers, and liſtning a few Moments to
the contemptuous Jeſts they threw out againſt
the abſent Beauty, declar'd herſelf in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
which in a Moment, ſuch was the Force
of her univerſally acknowledg'd Merit, and the
Deference always pay'd to her Opinion, ſilenc'd
every pretty Impertinent around her.</p>
               <p>This Lady, who among her own Sex had no
Superior in Wit, Elegance, and Eaſe, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to very few of the other in Senſe, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Judgment. Her Skill in Poetry,
Painting, and Muſick, tho' inconteſtably great,
was number'd among the leaſt of her Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.
Her Candour, her Sweetneſs, her
Modeſty and Benevolence, while they ſecur'd
her from the Darts of Envy, render'd her ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0005700702:232"/>
to Praiſe, and made the one as unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
as the other ineffectual.</p>
               <p>She had been a Witneſs of the Surprize
<hi>Arabella</hi>'s extraordinary Appearance had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd,
and ſtruck with that as well as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Charms of her Perſon, had preſt near
her with ſeveral others of the Company, when
ſhe was diſcourſing in the Manner we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p>A Perſon of the Counteſs's nice Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could not fail of obſerving the Wit and
Spirit, which tho' obſcur'd, was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
hid under the Abſurdity of her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And this Diſcovery adding Eſteem to
the Compaſſion ſhe felt for the fair Viſionary,
ſhe reſolv'd to reſcue her from the ill-natur'd
Raillery of her Sex; praiſing therefore her
Underſtanding, and the Beauty of her Perſon
with a Sweetneſs and Generoſity peculiar to
herſelf, ſhe accounted in the moſt delicate
Manner imaginable for the Singularity of her
Notions, from her Studies, her Retirment, her
Ignorance of the World, and her lively Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
And to abate the Keenneſs of their
Sarcaſms, acknowledg'd, that ſhe herſelf had
when very young, been deep read in Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and but for an early Acquaintance with
the World, and being directed to other Studies,
was likely to have been as much a Heroine as
Lady <hi>Bella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> tho' ſhe was ſecretly vex'd at
this Defence of her Couſin, was however under
a Neceſſity of ſeeming oblig'd to the Counteſs
for it: And that Lady expreſſing a Deſire to be
acquainted with Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0005700702:233"/>
reſpectfully offer'd to attend her Couſin to her
Lodgings, which the Counteſs as reſpectfully
declin'd, ſaying, As Lady <hi>Bella</hi> was a Stranger,
ſhe would make her the firſt Viſit.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> at her Return gave her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Account of what had happen'd at the
Aſſembly, and fill'd him with an inconceivable
Joy at the Counteſs's Intention. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been a zealous Admirer of that Lady's
Character, and flatter'd himſelf that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of ſo admirable a Woman would be
of the utmoſt Uſe to <hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That very Night he mention'd her to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Couſin; and after enumerating all her
fine Qualities, declar'd that ſhe had already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Friendſhip for her, and was ſolicitous of
her Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>I think myſelf extremely fortunate, replied
<hi>Arabella,</hi> in that I have (tho' queſtionleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly)
acquir'd the Amity of this lovely
Perſon; and I beg you, purſued ſhe to Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> to tell her, that I long with Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to embrace her, and to give her that
Share in my Heart which her tranſcendent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
deſerves.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> only bow'd her Head in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to this Requeſt, giving her Brother at the
ſame Time a ſignificant Leer; who tho' uſed
to <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Particularities, could not help be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little confounded at the heroick Speech
ſhe had made.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing ſomething which at firſt Sight
may poſſibly puzzle the Reader.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Counteſs was as good as her Word,
and two Days after ſent a Card to <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
importing her Deſign to wait on her that
Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Our Heroine expected her with great Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and the Moment ſhe enter'd the Room
flew towards her with a graceful Eagerneſs, and
ſtraining her in her Arms, embrac'd her with
all the Fervour of a long abſent Friend.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles</hi> and Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> were equally
embarraſs'd at the Familiarity of this Addreſs;
but obſerving that the Counteſs ſeem'd not to
be ſurpriz'd at it, but rather to receive it with
Pleaſure, they were ſoon compos'd.</p>
               <p>You cannot imagine, lovely Stranger, ſaid
<hi>Arabella</hi> to the Counteſs, as ſoon as they were
ſeated, with what Impatience I have long'd to
behold you, ſince the Knowledge I have receiv'd
of your rare Qualities, and the Friendſhip you
have been pleas'd to honour me with—And I
may truly proteſt to you, that ſuch is my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of your Virtues, that I would have
gone to the fartheſt Part of the World to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you that which you with ſo much Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
have condeſcended to beſtow upon me.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles</hi> ſtar'd at this extraordinary Speech,
and not being able to comprehend a Word of
it, was concern'd to think how the Lady to
whom it was addreſs'd would underſtand it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0005700702:235"/>
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> look'd down, and bit his Nails
in extreme Confuſion; but the Counteſs who
had not forgot the Language of Romance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
the Compliment in a Strain as heroick as
hers.</p>
               <p>The Favour I have receiv'd from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
ſaid, ſhe, in bringing me to the Happineſs
of your Acquaintance, charming <hi>Arabella,</hi> is
ſo great, that I may rationally expect ſome ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Misfortune will befall me: Seeing that in
this Life our Pleaſures are ſo conſtantly ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Pains, that we hardly ever enjoy the one
without ſuffering the other ſoon after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> was quite tranſported to hear the
Counteſs expreſs herſelf in Language ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to her own; but Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was
greatly confounded, and began to ſuſpect ſhe was
diverting herſelf with his Couſin's Singularities:
And Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was within a little of thinking
her as much out of the Way as his Niece.</p>
               <p>Misfortunes, Madam, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> are too
often the Lot of excellent Perſons like yourſelf.
The ſublimeſt among Mortals both for Beauty
and Virtue have experienc'd the Frowns of Fate.
The Sufferings of the divine <hi>Statira</hi> or <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi>
for ſhe bore both Names, the Perſecutions
of the incomparable <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the Diſſreſſes of
the beautiful <hi>Cundace,</hi> and the Afflictions of the
fair and generous <hi>Mandana,</hi> are Proofs that the
moſt illuſtrious Perſons in the World have felt
the Rage of Calamity.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, ſaid the Counteſs, that
all thoſe fair Princeſſes you have nam'd, were
for a while extremely unfortunate: Yet in the
Catalogue of theſe lovely and afflicted Perſons
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0005700702:236"/>
you have forgot one who might with Juſtice
diſpute the Priority of Sufferings with them all—
I mean the beautiful <hi>Eliſa,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Parthia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pardon me, Madam, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be of your Opinion. The Princeſs of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi>
may indeed juſtly be rank'd among the
Number of unfortunate Perſons, but ſhe can
by no means diſpute the melancholy Precedence
with the divine <hi>Cleopatra</hi>—For in fine, Madam,
what Evils did the Princeſs of <hi>Parthia</hi> ſuffer
which the fair <hi>Cleopatra</hi> did not likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and ſome of them haply in a greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree?
If <hi>Eliſa</hi> by the tyrannical Authority of
the King her Father, ſaw herſelf upon the Point
of becoming the Wife of a Prince ſhe deteſted,
was not the beautiful Daughter of <hi>Antony,</hi> by
the more unjuſtifiable Tyranny of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> likely
to be forced into the Arms of <hi>Tyberius,</hi> a proud
and cruel Prince, who was odious to the whole
World as well as to her? If <hi>Eliſa</hi> was for ſome
time in the Power of Pyrates, was not <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
Captive to an inhuman King, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
his Sword to the fair Breaſt of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Princeſs worthy the Adoration of the
whole Earth? And in fine, if <hi>Eliſa</hi> had the
Grief to ſee her dear <hi>Artaban</hi> impriſon'd by the
Order of <hi>Auguſtus, Cleopatra</hi> beheld with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Agonies, her beloved <hi>Coriolanus</hi> inclos'd
amidſt the Guards of that enrag'd Prince, and
doom'd to a cruel Death.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, Madam, reply'd the Counteſs,
that the Misfortunes of both theſe Princeſſes
were very great, tho' as you have ſhew'd me
with ſome Inequality: And when one reflects
upon the dangerous Adventures to which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0005700702:237"/>
of their Quality were expos'd in thoſe
Times, one cannot help rejoicing that we live
in an Age in which the Cuſtoms, Manners,
Habits, and Inclinations differ ſo widely from
theirs, that 'tis impoſſible ſuch Adventures
ſhould even happen.</p>
               <p>Such is the ſtrange Alteration of Things, that
ſome People I dare ſay at preſent, cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
to believe there ever were Princeſſes wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thro' the World by Land and Sea in mean
Diſguiſes, carry'd away violently out of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Dominions by inſolent Lovers—Some
diſcover'd ſleeping in Foreſts, other Shipwreck'd
on deſolate Iſlands, confin'd in Caſtles, bound
in Chariots, and even ſtrugling amidſt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
Waves of the Sea, into which they
had caſt themſelves to avoid the brutal Force of
their-Raviſhers. Not one of theſe Things hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happen'd within the Compaſs of ſeveral
thouſand Years, People unlearn'd in Antiquity
would be apt to deem them idle Tales, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
do they appear at preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> tho' greatly ſurpriz'd at this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
did not think proper to expreſs her
Thoughts of it. She was unwilling to appear
abſolutely ignorant of the preſent Cuſtoms of
the World, before a Lady whoſe good Opinion
ſhe was ardently deſirous of improving. Her
Prepoſſeſſions in favour of the Counteſs made
her receive the new Delights ſhe held out to her
with Reſpect, tho' not without Doubt and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolution.
Her Bluſhes, her Silence, and
down-caſt Eyes gave the Counteſs to underſtand
Part of her Thoughts; who for fear of alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her too much for that Time, dropt the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0005700702:238"/>
Subject, and turning the Converſation on others
more general, gave <hi>Arabella</hi> an Opportunity of
mingling in it with that Wit and Vivacity
which was natural to her when Romances
were out of the Queſtion.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which if the Reader has not antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
it, he will find an Explanation
of ſome ſeeming Inconſiſtencies in the
foregoing Chapter.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Counteſs, charm'd with the Wit
and good Senſe of <hi>Arabella,</hi> could not
conceal her Admiration, but expreſt it in Terms
the moſt obligingly imaginable: And <hi>Arabella,</hi>
who was exceſſively delighted with her, return'd
the Compliments ſhe made her with the moſt
reſpectful Tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe mutual Civilities,
<hi>Arabella</hi> in the Style of Romance, intreated
the Counteſs to favour her with the Recital of
her Adventures.</p>
               <p>At the Mention of this Requeſt, that Lady
convey'd ſo much Confuſion into her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that <hi>Arabella</hi> extremely embarraſs'd by
it, tho' ſhe knew not why, thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to apologize for the Diſturbance ſhe ſeem'd
to have occaſion'd in her.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, Madam, reply'd the Counteſs
recovering herſelf, if the uncommoneſs of your
Requeſt made a Moment's Reflexion neceſſary
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0005700702:239"/>
to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> that a young Lady of your
Senſe and Delicacy could mean no Offence to
Decorum by making it. The Word Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
carries in it ſo free and licentious a Sound
in the Apprehenſions of People at this Period
of Time, that it can hardly with Propriety be
apply'd to thoſe few and natural Incidents which
compoſe the Hiſtory of a Woman of Honour.
And when I tell you, purſued ſhe with a Smile,
that I was born and chriſten'd, had a uſeful
and proper Education, receiv'd the Addreſſes of
my Lord—through the Recommendation
of my Parents, and marry'd him with their
Conſents and my own Inclination; and that
ſince we have liv'd in great Harmony together,
I have told you all the material Paſſages of my
Life, which upon Enquiry you will find differ
very little from thoſe of other Women of the
ſame Rank, who have a moderate Share of
Senſe, Prudence and Virtue.</p>
               <p>Since you have already, Madam, replied
<hi>Arabella</hi> bluſhing, excus'd me for the Liberty
I took with you, it will be un-neceſſary to tell
you it was grounded upon the Cuſtoms of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Times, when Ladies of the higheſt Rank
and ſublimeſt Virtue, were often expos'd to a
Variety of cruel Adventures which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
in Confidence to each other, when
Chance brought them together.</p>
               <p>Cuſtom, ſaid the Counteſs ſmiling, changes the
very Nature of Things, and what was honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a thouſand Years ago, may probably be look'd
upon as infamous now—A Lady in the heroick
Age you ſpeak of, would not be thought to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
any great Share of Merit, if ſhe had not
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0005700702:240"/>
been many times carried away by one or other
of her inſolent Lovers: Whereas a Beauty in
this could not paſs thro' the Hands of ſeveral
different Raviſhers, without bringing an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on her Chaſtity.</p>
               <p>The ſame Actions which made a Man a
Hero in thoſe Times, would conſtitute him a
Murderer in Theſe—And the ſame Steps which
led him to a Throne Then, would infallibly
conduct him to a Scaffold Now.</p>
               <p>But Cuſtom, Madam, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> cannot
poſſibly change the Nature of Virtue or Vice:
And ſince Virtue is the chief Characteriſtick of
a Hero, a Hero in the laſt Age will be a Hero
in this—Tho' the Natures of Virtue or Vice
cannot be changed, replied the Counteſs, yet
they may be miſtaken; and different Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Cuſtoms, and Education, may probably
change their Names, if not their Natures.</p>
               <p>Sure, Madam, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi> a little moved,
you do not intend by this Inference to prove
<hi>Oroondates, Artaxerxes, Juba, Artaban,</hi> and the
other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men?</p>
               <p>Judging them by the Rules of Chriſtianity,
and our preſent Notions of Honour, Juſtice,
and Humanity, they certainly are, replied the
Counteſs.</p>
               <p>Did they not poſſeſs all the neceſſary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of Heroes, Madam, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> and
each in a ſuperlative Degree?—Was not their
Valour invincible, their Generoſity unbounded,
and their Fidelity inviolable?</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, ſaid the Counteſs, but
that their Valour was invincible; and many
thouſand Men leſs courageous than themſelves,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0005700702:241"/>
felt the fatal Effects of that invincible Valour,
which was perpetually ſeeking after Occaſions
to exert itſelf. <hi>Oroondates</hi> gave many extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Proofs of that unbounded Generoſity ſo
natural to the Heroes of his Time. This Prince
being ſent by the King his Father, at the Head
of an Army, to oppoſe the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch,
who had unjuſtly invaded his Dominions, and
was deſtroying the Lives and Properties of his
Subjects; having taken the Wives and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of his Enemy Priſoners, had by theſe Means
an Opportunity to put a Period to a War ſo
deſtructive to his Country: Yet out of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
truly heroick, he releas'd them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
without any Conditions; and falling in
Love with one of thoſe Princeſſes, ſecietly
quitted his Father's Court, reſided ſeveral Years
in that of the Enemy of his Father and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
engag'd himſelf to his Daughter, and when
the War broke out again between the two
Kings, fought furiouſly againſt an Army in
which the King his Father was in Perſon, and
ſhed the Blood of his future Subjects without
Remorſe; tho' each of thoſe Subjects, we are
told, would have ſacrific'd his Life to ſave that
of their Prince, ſo much was he belov'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Such are the Actions which immortalize the
Heroes of Romance, and are by the Authors
of thoſe Books ſtyl'd glorious, godlike, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
Yet judging of them as Chriſtians, we
ſhall find them impious and baſe, and directly
oppoſite to our preſent Notions of moral and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Duties.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain therefore, Madam, added the
Conteſs with a Smile, that what was Virtue in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0005700702:242"/>
thoſe Days, is Vice in ours: And to form a
Hero according to our Notions of 'em at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
'tis neſſary to give him Qualities very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from <hi>Oroondates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecret Charm in the Countenance, Voice,
and Manner of the Counteſs, join'd to the
Force of her reaſoning, could not fail of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome Impreſſion on the Mind of <hi>Arabella;</hi>
but it was ſuch an Impreſſion as came far ſhort
of Conviction. She was ſurpriz'd embarraſs'd,
perplex'd, but not convinc'd. Heroiſm, roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Heroiſm, was deeply rooted in her Heart;
it was her Habit of thinking, a Principle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd
from Education. She could not ſeparate
her Ideas of Glory, Virtue, Courage, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
and Honour, from the falſe Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them in the Actions of <hi>Oroondates,
Juba, Artaxerxes,</hi> and the reſt of the imaginary
Heroes. The Counteſs's Diſcourſe had rais'd a
Kind of Tumult in her Thoughts, which gave
an Air of Perplexity to her lovely Face, and
made that Lady apprehenſive ſhe had gone too
far, and loſt that Ground in her Eſteem, which
ſhe had endeavour'd to acquire by a Conformity
to ſome of her Notions and Language. In this
however, ſhe was miſtaken; <hi>Arabella</hi> felt a
Tenderneſs for her that had already the Force of
a long contracted Friendſhip, and an Eſteem
little leſs than Veneration.</p>
               <p>When the Counteſs took Leave, the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of <hi>Arabella,</hi> tho' deliver'd in the Language
of Romance, were very ſincere and affecting,
and were return'd with an equal Degree of
Tenderneſs by the Counteſs, who had conceiv'd
a more than ordinary Affection for her.</p>

Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> who could have almoſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd
the Counteſs for the generous Deſign be

as he handed her to her Chair, to intreat in a

Dignity and Sweetneſs ſhe aſſur'd him of.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Glanville</hi> at his Return to the Dining-Room,

Whims in her Head as my Niece. Ad's-heart,
what a deal of Stuff did ſhe talk about! A
Parcel of Heroes as ſhe calls them, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
hard Names—In my Mind ſhe is more
likely to make Lady <hi>Bella</hi> worſe than better.</p>

at laſt to confeſs ſhe manag'd the Thing very

               <p>The Counteſs, who had reſolv'd to take
<hi>Arabella</hi> openly into her Protection, was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Means to engage her to appear at the

Aſſembly, whither ſhe propos'd to accompany
her in a modern Dreſs. But her good Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>Her ſudden Departure gave <hi>Arabella</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

ſhe does not ſuit my Taſte—She is very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

much for a Lady, as I heard my Lord <hi>Fribble</hi>
ſay one Day: Then ſhe is quite unfaſhionable:
She hates Cards, keeps no Aſſembly, is ſeen but
ſeldom at Publick Places; and in my Opinion,
as well as in a great many others, is the dulleſt
Company in the World. I'm ſure I met her
at a Viſit a little before I went down to your

in the Room, before ſhe ſet a whole Circle of
Ladies a yawning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> tho' ſhe had a ſincere Contempt for
her Couſin's Manner of thinking, yet always
politely conceal'd it; and vex'd as ſhe was at

herſelf with gently defending her, telling her at

As her Romances had long familiariz'd her
Thoughts to Objects of Grandeur and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
ſhe was not ſo much ſtruck as might
have been expected, with thoſe that now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
themſelves to her View. Nor was ſhe
a little diſappointed to find that among the Men
ſhe ſaw none whoſe Appearance came up to her
Ideas of the Air and Port of an <hi>Artaban, Oroon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
or <hi>Juba;</hi> or any of the Ladies, who did
not in her Opinion, fall ſhort of the Perfections
of <hi>Eliſa, Mandana, Statira,</hi> &amp;c. 'Twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
too, that ſhe never enquir'd how often
the Princeſſes had been carried away by capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
Monarchs, or how many Victories the
King's Sons had gain'd; but ſeem'd the whole
Time ſhe was there to have ſuſpended all her
Romantick Ideas of Glory, Beauty, Gallantry,
and Love.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was highly pleas'd with her
compos'd Behaviour, and a Day or two after
intreated her to allow him the Honour of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her what was remarkable and worthy of her
Obſervation in this great Metropolis. To this
ſhe alſo conſented, and for the greater Privacy
began their Travels in a hir'd Coach.</p>
               <p>Part of ſeveral Days were taken up in this
Employment; but Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> had the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
to find ſhe was full of Alluſions to her
Romances upon every Occaſion, ſuch as her
asking the Perſon who ſhews the Armoury at
the <hi>Tower,</hi> the Names of the Knights to whom
each Suit belong'd, and wondering there were no
Devices on the Shields or Plumes of Feathers
in the Helmets: She obſerv'd that the Lyon <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus</hi>
kill'd, was according to the Hiſtory of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0005700702:249"/>
that Prince, much larger than any of thoſe ſhe
was ſhew'd in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and alſo much fiercer.
Took Notice that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s was leſs magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in the Inſide, than the Temple in which
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> when he went to <hi>Mandana,</hi> heard her
return Thanks for his ſuppos'd Death: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
if it was not cuſtomary for the King and
his whole Court to ſail in Barges upon the
<hi>Thames,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> uſed to do upon the <hi>Tyber,</hi>
whether they had not Muſick and Collations
in the Park, and where they celebrated the Juſts
and Tournaments.</p>
               <p>The Seaſon for <hi>Vaux-Hall</hi> being not yet over,
ſhe was deſirous of once ſeeing a Place, which
by the Deſcription ſhe had heard of it, greatly
reſembled the Gardens of <hi>Lucullus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in
which the Emperor, with all the Princes and
Princeſſes of his Court were ſo nobly entertain'd,
and where ſo many gallant Converſations had
paſs'd among thoſe admirable Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Singularity of her Dreſs, for ſhe was
cover'd with her Veil, drew a Number of
Gazers after her, who preſt round her with ſo
little Reſpect, that ſhe was greatly embarraſs'd,
and had Thoughts of quitting the Place, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
as ſhe own'd it, immediately, when her
Attention was wholly engroſs'd by an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in which ſhe ſoon intereſted herſelf very
deeply.</p>
               <p>An Officer of Rank in the Sea Service had
brought his Miſtreſs diſguis'd in a Suit of Man's
or rather Boy's Cloaths, and a Hat and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
into the Gardens. The young Creature
being a little intoxicated with the Wine ſhe had
taken too freely, was thrown ſo much off her
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0005700702:250"/>
Guard as to give Occaſion to ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to ſuſpect her Sex; and a gay Fellow, in
order to give them ſome Diverſion at her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
pretending to be affronted at ſomething
ſhe ſaid, drew his Sword upon the diſguis'd Fair
One, which ſo alarm'd her, that ſhe ſhriek'd
out, She was a Woman, and ran for Protection
to her Lover, who was ſo diſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rder'd with Liquor,
that he was not able to defend her.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> ever curious and inquiſitive,
demanded the Cauſe why the Company ran in
Crouds to that particular Spot; and receiv'd
for Anſwer, That a Gentleman had drawn his
Sword upon a Lady diſguis'd in a Man's Habit.</p>
               <p>Oh Heav'ns! cry'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> this muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be a very notable Adventure. The Lady
has doubtleſs ſome extraordinary Circumſtances
in her Story, and haply upon Enquiry, her Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
will be found to reſemble thoſe which
oblig'd the beautiful <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> to put on the ſame
Diſguiſe, who was by that Means murder'd by
the cruel <hi>Zenodorus</hi> in a Fit of Jealouſy at the
Amity his Wife expreſt for her. But can I
not ſee this unfortunate Fair One, added ſhe,
preſſing in ſpite of Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Intreaties
thro' the Croud—I may haply be able to afford
her ſome Conſolation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> finding his Perſuaſions were
not regarded, follow'd her with very little Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty:
For her Veil falling back in her Hurry,
ſhe did not mind to replace it, and the Charms
of her Face, join'd to the Majeſty of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and Singularity of her Dreſs, attracting
every Perſon's Attention and Reſpect, they
made Way for her to paſs, not a little ſurpriz'd
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0005700702:251"/>
at the extreme Earneſtneſs and Solemnity that
appear'd in her Countenance upon an Event ſo
diverting to every one elſe.</p>
               <p>The diſguis'd Lady whom ſhe was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to approach, had thrown herſelf upon
a Bench in one of the Boxes, trembling ſtill
with the Apprehenſion of the Sword, tho' her
Antagoniſt was kneeling at her Feet, making
Love to her in Mock-Heroicks for the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Company.</p>
               <p>Her Hat and Peruke had fallen off in her
Fright, and her Hair which had been turn'd
up under it, hung now looſely about her Neck,
and gave ſuch an Appearance of Woe to a Face,
which notwithſtanding the Paleneſs that Terror
had overſpread it with, was really extremely
pretty, that <hi>Arabella</hi> was equally ſtruck with
Compaſſion and Admiration of her.</p>
               <p>Lovely Unknown, ſaid ſhe to her with an
Air of extreme Tenderneſs, tho' I am a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
both to your Name and Hiſtory, yet your
Aſpect perſuading me your Quality is not mean,
and the Condition and Diſguiſe in which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
you, ſhewing that you are Unfortunate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to offer you all the Aſſiſtances in my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
ſeeing that I am mov'd thereto by my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for your Diſtreſs, and that Eſteem which
the Sight of you muſt neceſſarily inſpire.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was ſtruck dumb with Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at this ſtrange Speech, and at the Whiſpers
and Scoffs it occaſion'd among the Spectators. He
attempted to take hold of her Hand in order to
lead her away, but ſhe diſengag'd herſelf from
him with a Frown of Diſpleaſure; and taking
no Notice of Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who whiſper'd
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0005700702:252"/>
with great Emotion, Lord, Couſin, how you
expoſe yourſelf! preſt nearer to the Beautiful
Diſguis'd, and again repeated her Offers of
Service.</p>
               <p>The Girl being perfectly recover'd from her
Intoxication by the Fright ſhe had been in, gaz'd
upon <hi>Arabella</hi> with a Look of extreme Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize:
Yet being mov'd to reſpect by the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of her Appearance, and ſtrange as her
Words ſeem'd to be by the obliging Purport of
them, and the affecting Earneſtneſs with which
they were deliver'd, ſhe roſe from her Seat and
thank'd her, with an Accept full of Regard
and Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>Fair Maid, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> taking her Hand,
let us quit this Place, where your Diſcovery
may probably ſubject you to more Dangers: If
you will be pleas'd to put yourſelf into my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and acquaint me with the Hiſtory of
your Miſfortunes; I have Intereſt enough with
a valiant Perſon who ſhall undertake to free you
from your Perſecutions, and re-eſtabliſh the
Repoſe of your Life.</p>
               <p>The kneeling Hero, who as well as every
one elſe that were preſent, had gaz'd with Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
at <hi>Arabella</hi> during all this Paſſage,
perceiving ſhe was about to rob him of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
Fair, ſeiz'd hold of the Hand ſhe had at
Liberty, and ſwore he would not part with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> almoſt mad with Vexation,
endeavour'd to get <hi>Arabella</hi> away.</p>
               <p>Are you mad, Madam, ſaid he in a Whiſper,
to make all this Rout about a Proſtitute? Do
you ſee how every body ſtares at you? What
will they think—For Heav'ns ſake let us be
gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0005700702:253"/>
What, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella</hi> in a Rage, Are
you baſe enough to leave this admirable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Power of that Man, who is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs
her Raviſher; and will you not draw
your Sword in her Defence?</p>
               <p>Hey day! cry'd the Sea-Officer, wak'd out of
his ſtupid Doſe by the Clamour about him: What's
the Matter here—What are you doing? Where's
my <hi>Lucy?</hi> Zoons! Sir, ſaid he to the young
Fellow who held her, What Buſineſs have you
with my <hi>Lucy?</hi> And uttering a dreadful Oath,
drew out his Sword, and ſtagger'd towards his
gay Rival, who obſerving the Weakneſs of his
Antagoniſt, flouriſh'd with his Sword to ſhew
his Courage and frighten the Ladies, who all
ran away ſcreaming. <hi>Arabella</hi> taking Miſs
<hi>Glanville</hi> under the Arm, cried out to Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> as ſhe left the Place, to take Care of
the diſtreſs'd Lady, and while the two Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were diſputing for her, to carry her away
in Safety.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> without regarding this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
haſten'd after her; and to pacify her,
told her the Lady was reſcu'd by her favourite
Lover, and carry'd off in Triumph.</p>
               <p>But are you ſure, ſaid <hi>Aabella,</hi> it was not
ſome other of her Raviſhers who carry'd her
away, and not the Perſon whom ſhe has haply
favour'd with her Affection? May not the ſame
Thing have happen'd to her, as did to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Candace,</hi> Queen of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> who while
two of her Raviſhers were fighting for her, a
third whom ſhe took for her Deliverer, came
and carry'd her away.</p>

                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0005700702:254"/>
But ſhe went away willingly, I aſſure you,
Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville:</hi> Pray don't be in
any Concern about her—</p>
               <p>If ſhe went away willingly with him, reply'd
<hi>Arabella,</hi> 'tis probable it may not be another
Raviſher: And yet if this Perſon that reſcu'd
her happen'd to be in Armour, and the Vizor
of his Helmet down, ſhe might be miſtaken as

               </p>
               <p>Well, well, he was not in Armour, Madam,

               <p>You ſeem to be diſturb'd, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi>
a little ſurpriz'd at his peeviſh Tone: Is there
any Thing in this Adventure which concerns
you? Nay, now I remember, you did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to defend the Beautiful Unknown. I am
not willing to impute your In-action upon ſuch
an Occaſion, to Want of Courage or Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;
perhaps you are acquainted with her Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
and from this Knowledge refus'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in her Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> perceiving the Company gather
from all Parts to the Walk they were in, told
her he would acquaint her with all he knew
concerning the diſguis'd Lady when they were
in the Coach on their Return Home; and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
impatient for the promis'd Story, propos'd
to leave the Gardens immediately, which was
gladly comply'd with by Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who
heartily repented his having carry'd her thither.</p>

                  <p>Which ends with a very unfavourable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
for our Heroine.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS ſoon as they were ſeated in the Coach ſhe
did not fail to call upon him to perform
his Promiſe: But Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> exceſſively out
of Humour at her expoſing herſelf in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
reply'd, without conſidering whether he
ſhuld not offend her, That he knew no more
of the diſguis'd Lady than any body elſe in the
Place.</p>
               <p>How, Sir, reply'd <hi>Arabella,</hi> Did you not
promiſe to relate her Adventures to me? And
would you have me believe you knew no more
of them than the reſt of the Cavaliers and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in the Place?</p>
               <p>Upon my Soul, I don't, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville;</hi>
yet what I know of her is ſufficient to
let me underſtand ſhe was not worth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
you ſeem'd to have for her.</p>
               <p>She cannot ſure be more indiſcreet than the
fair and unfortunate <hi>Hermione,</hi> reply'd <hi>Arabella;</hi>
who like her put on Man's Apparel, through
Deſpair at the ill Succeſs of her Paſſion for <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
—And certain it is, that tho' the beautiful
<hi>Hermione</hi> was guilty of one great Error which
loſt her the Eſteem of <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet ſhe had a
high and noble Soul; as was manifeſt by her
Behaviour and Words when ſhe was run thro'
by the Sword of <hi>Demetrius.</hi> Oh! Death, cry'd
ſhe, as ſhe was falling, how ſweet do I find
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0005700702:256"/>
thee, and how much and how earneſtly have I
deſir'd thee!</p>
               <p>Oh Lord! oh Lord! cry'd Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>
hardly ſenſible of what he ſaid, Was there ever
any Thing ſo intolerable?</p>
               <p>Do you pity the unhappy <hi>Hermione,</hi> Sir? ſaid
<hi>Arabella</hi> interpreting his Exclamation her own
Way? Indeed ſhe is well worthy of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.
And if the bare Recital of the Words
ſhe utter'd at receiving her Death's Wound af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
you ſo much, you may gueſs what would
have been your Agonies, had you been <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi>
that gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> groaning aloud thro' Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
at her Abſurdities—</p>
               <p>This Subject affects you deeply, I perceive,
ſaid <hi>Arabella.</hi> There is no Queſtion but you
would have acted in the ſame Circumſtance, as
<hi>Demetrius</hi> did: Yet let me tell you, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy
of his Rage and Deſpair for what
he had innocently committed, was imputed to
him as a great Imbecillity, as was alſo the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Paſſion he conceiv'd ſoon after for the Fair
<hi>Deidamia.</hi> You know the Accident which
brought that fair Princeſs into his Way.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I do not, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glanville</hi>
peeviſhly.</p>
               <p>Well, then I'll tell you, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> but
pauſing a little:</p>
               <p>The Recital I have engag'd myſelf to make,
added ſhe, will neceſſarily take up ſome Hours
Time, as upon Reflexion I have found: So if
you will diſpenſe with my beginning it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
I will ſatisfy your Curioſity To-morrow,
when I may be able to purſue it without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>

To this Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> made no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
than a Bow with his Head; and the Coach
a few Moments after arriving at their own
Houſe, he led her to her Apartment, firmly
reſolv'd never to attend her to any more Publick
Places while ſhe continued in the ſame ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Folly.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who had ſeveral Times been in
doubt whether <hi>Arabella</hi> was not really diſorder'd
in her Senſes; upon Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Account
of her Behaviour at the Gardens, concluded
ſhe was abſolutely mad, and held a ſhort Debate
with himſelf, Whether he ought not to bring
a Commiſſion of Lunacy againſt her, rather
than marry her to his Son, whom he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
could never be happy with a Wife ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably
abſurd. Tho' he only hinted at
this to Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> in a Converſation he had
with him while his Diſſatisfaction was at its
Height, concerning <hi>Arabella,</hi> yet the bare Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that his Father ever thought of ſuch a
Thing, threw the young Gentleman into ſuch
Agonies, that Sir <hi>Charles</hi> to compoſe him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
he would do nothing in relation to his
Niece that he would not approve of. Yet he
expoſtulated with him on the Abſurdity of her
Behaviour, and the Ridicule to which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
herſelf wherever ſhe went; appealing to
him, whether in a Wife he could think thoſe
Follies ſupportable, which in a Miſtreſs occaſion'd
him ſo much Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> as much in Love as he was,
felt all the Force of this Inference, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to his Father, That he could not think
of marrying <hi>Arabella,</hi> till the Whims her Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0005700702:258"/>
had put into her Head, were craz'd by
a better Knowledge of Life and Manners. But
he added with a Sigh, That he knew not how
this Reformation would be effected; for ſhe
had ſuch a ſtrange Facility in reconciling every
Incident to her own fantaſtick Ideas, that every
new Object added Strength to the fatal Deception
ſhe laboured under.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which Arabella meets with another
admirable Adventure.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OUR lovely Heroine had not been above a
Fortnight in <hi>London,</hi> before the groſs Air
of that ſmoaky Town affected her Health ſo
much, that Sir <hi>Charles</hi> propos'd to her to go for
a few Weeks to <hi>Richmond,</hi> where he hir'd a
Houſe elegantly furniſh'd for her Reception.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> had been too long out of that
darling City, to pay her the Compliment of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
her conſtantly at <hi>Richmond;</hi> yet ſhe
promis'd to be as often as poſſible with her: And
Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> having Affaris that could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with his Abſence from town, plac'd his
Steward in her Houſe, being a Perſon whoſe
Prudence and Fidelity he could rely upon; and
he, with her Women, and two or three other
menial Servants, made up her Equipage.</p>
               <p>As it was not conſiſtent with Decorum for
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> to reſide in her Houſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
himſelf with riding to <hi>Richmond</hi> generally
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0005700702:259"/>
every Day: And as long as <hi>Arabella</hi> was pleas'd
with that Retirement, he reſolv'd not to
preſs her Return to Town till the Counteſs
of—arriv'd, in whoſe Converſation he
grounded all his Hopes of her Cure.</p>
               <p>At that Seaſon of the Year <hi>Richmond</hi> not
being quite deſerted by Company, <hi>Arabella</hi> was
viſited by ſeveral Ladies of Faſhion; who
charm'd with her Affability, Politeneſs, and
good Senſe, were ſtrangely perplex'd how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for ſome Peculiarities in her Dreſs and
Manner of thinking.</p>
               <p>Some of the younger Sort from whom <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
extraordinary Beauty took away all Pretenſions
to Equality on that Score, made themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
merry with her Oddneſſes, as they call'd
them, and gave broad Intimations that her
Head was not right.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Arabella,</hi> whoſe Taſte was as delicate,
Sentiments as refin'd, and Judgment as clear as
any Perſon's could be who believ'd the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity
of <hi>Scudery</hi>'s Romances, ſhe was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſappointed to find no Lady with whom ſhe
could converſe with any tolerable Pleaſure: And
that inſtead of <hi>Clelia</hi>'s, <hi>Statira</hi>'s <hi>Mandana</hi>'s, &amp;c.
ſhe found only Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> among all ſhe
knew.</p>
               <p>The Compariſon ſhe drew between ſuch as
theſe and the charming Counteſs of—whom
ſhe had juſt begun to be acquainted with at <hi>Bath,</hi>
increas'd her Regret for the Interruption that
was given to ſo agreeable a Friendſhip: And it
was with infinite Pleaſure Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> heard
her repeatedly wiſh for the Arrival of that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Lady (as ſhe always call'd her) in Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0005700702:260"/>
Not being able to reliſh that inſipid Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of the young Ladies that viſited her at
<hi>Richmond,</hi> her chief Amuſement was to walk in
the Park there; which becauſe of its Rural Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
was extremely agreeable to her Inclinations.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe indulg'd Contemplation, leaning on
the Arm of her faithful <hi>Lucy,</hi> while her other
Women walk'd at ſome Diſtance behind her, and
two Men Servants kept her always in Sight.</p>
               <p>One Evening when ſhe was returning from
her uſual Walk, ſhe heard the Sound of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Voice, which ſeem'd to proceed from a
Tuft of Trees that hid her from her View.
And ſtopping a Moment, diſtinguiſh'd ſome
plaintive Accents, which increaſing her Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
ſhe advanc'd towards the Place, telling
<hi>Lucy,</hi> ſhe was reſolv'd if poſſible to diſcover
who the diſtreſs'd Lady was, and what was the
Subject of her Affliction.</p>
               <p>As ſhe drew nearer with ſoftly treading Steps,
ſhe could diſtinguiſh through the Branches of
the Trees, now deſpoil'd of great part of their
Leaves, two Women ſeated on the Ground,
their Backs towards her, and one of them with
her Head gently reclin'd on the other's Shoulder,
ſeem'd by her mournful Action to be weeping;
for ſhe often put her Handkerchief to her Eyes,
breathing every Time a Sigh, which, as <hi>Arabella</hi>
phras'd it, ſeem'd to proceed from the deepeſt
Receſſes of her Heart.</p>
               <p>This Adventure, more worthy indeed to be
ſtyl'd an Adventure than all our Fair Heroine
had ever yet met with, and ſo conformable to
what ſhe had read in Romances, fill'd her Heart
with eager Expectation. She made a Sign to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0005700702:261"/>
                  <hi>Lucy</hi> to make no Noiſe, and creeping ſtill cloſer
towards the Place where this afflicted Perſon
ſat, ſhe heard her diſtinctly utter theſe Words,
which however were often interrupted with her
Sighs.</p>
               <p>Ah! <hi>Ariamenes,</hi> whom I to my Misfortune
have too much loved, and whom to my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
I fear I ſhall never ſufficiently hate,
ſince that Heav'n and thy cruel Ingratitude hath
ordain'd that thou ſhalt never be mine, and that
ſo many ſweet and dear Hopes are for ever
taken from me, return me at leaſt, ungrateful
Man, return me thoſe Teſtimonies of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Affection, which were ſometimes ſo
dear and precious to thee. Return me thoſe
Favours, which all innocent as they were, are
become Criminal by thy Crime. Return me,
Cruel Man, return me thoſe Reliques of my
Heart which thou detaineſt in Deſpight of me,
and which, notwithſtanding thy Infidelity, I
cannot recover.</p>
               <p>Here her Tears interrupting her Speech,
<hi>Arabella</hi> being impatient to know the Hiſtory
of this afflicted Perſon, came ſoftly round to
the other Side, and ſhewing herſelf, occaſion'd
ſome Diſturbance to the ſad Unknown; who
riſing from her Seat, with her Face averted, as
if aſham'd of having ſo far diſclos'd her Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
in a Stranger's Hearing, endeavour'd to
paſs by her un-notic'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> perceiving her Deſign, ſtop'd her
with a very graceful Action, and with a Voice
all compos'd of Sweetneſs, earneſtly conjur'd
her to relate her Hiſtory.</p>

Think not, Lovely Unknown, ſaid ſhe (for

to detain you proceed from an indiſcreet Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
'Tis true, ſome Complaints which have
fallen from your fair Mouth, have rais'd in me a
Deſire to be acquainted with your Adventures;

               <p>Pardon me, Madam, ſaid the Fair Afflicted,
gazing on <hi>Arabella</hi> with many Signs of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
if my Confuſion at being over-heard
in a Place I had choſen to bewail my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
made me be guilty of ſome Appearance

wanted to avoid. But purſued ſhe, heſitating
a little, thoſe Characters of Beauty I behold in

                  <hi>Arabella</hi> aſſuring her, that whatever her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes

               <p>Be pleas'd to know then, Madam, ſaid ſhe,
that being bred up with all imaginable Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in my Father's Court, I had no ſooner

ſurrounded with Lovers; who nevertheleſs,
ſuch was the Severity with which I behav'd

Silence, well knowing Baniſhment from my
Preſence was the leaſt Puniſhment they had to
expect, if they preſum'd to declare their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to me.</p>
               <p>I liv'd in this Faſhion, Madam, for Two
Years longer, rejoicing in the Inſenſibility of
my own Heart, and triumphing in the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of others, when my Tranquillity was all
at once interrupted by an Accident which I am
going to relate to you.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs ſtopt here to give Vent to ſome
Sighs which a cruel Remembrance forc'd from
her; and continuing in a deep Muſe for five
or ſix Minutes, reſum'd her Story in this
Manner.</p>
               <p>It being my Cuſtom to walk in a Foreſt
adjoining to one of my Father's Sum mer
Reſidences, attended only by my Women,
one Day when I was taking this A muſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I perceiv'd at ſome Diſtance a Man ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Ground; and impell'd by a ſudden
Curioſity, I advanc'd towards this Perſon, whom
upon a nearer View I perceiv'd to have been
wounded very much, and fainted away through
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0005700702:265"/>
Loſs of Blood. His Habit being very rich, I
concluded by that he was of no mean Quality:
But when I had look'd upon his Countenance,
pale and languiſhing as it was, methought there
appear'd ſo many Marks of Greatneſs, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with a Sweetneſs ſo happily blended, that
my Attention was engag'd in an extraordinary
Manner, and intereſted me ſo powerfully in his
Safety, that I commanded ſome of my Women
to run immediately for proper Aſſiſtance, and
convey him to the Caſtle, while I directed
others to throw ſome Water in his Face, and
to apply ſome Linen to his Wounds, to ſtop
the Bleeding.</p>
               <p>Theſe charitable Cares reſtor'd the wounded
Stranger to his Senſes; he open'd his Eyes, and
turning them ſlowly to the Objects around him,
fix'd at laſt their languiſhing Looks on me:
When mov'd, as it ſhould ſeem, to ſome Reſpect
by what he ſaw in my Countenance, he roſe
with ſome Difficulty from the Ground, and
bowing almoſt down to it again, by that Action
ſeem'd to pay me his Acknowledgments for what
he ſuppos'd I had done for his Preſervation.</p>
               <p>His extreme Weakneſs having oblig'd him to
creep towards a Tree, againſt the Back of which
he ſupported himſelf, I went nearer to him, and
having told him the Condition in which I found
him, and the Orders I had diſpatch'd for Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
requeſted him to acquaint me with his
Name and Quality, and the Adventure which
had brought him into that Condition.</p>

my Birth is Noble enough; I have ſpent
ſome Years in my Travels, and was returning
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0005700702:266"/>
to my native Country, when paſſing thro' this
Foreſt I was ſeiz'd with an Inclination to ſleep.
I had ty'd my Horſe to a Tree, and retiring
ſome few Paces off, ſtretch'd myſelf at the Foot
of a large Oak whoſe Branches promis'd me an
agreeable Shade. I had not yet clos'd my Eyes,
when the Slumber I invited was diſſipated by
the Sound of ſome Voices near me.</p>
               <p>A Curioſity, not natural to me, made me
liſten to the Diſcourſe of theſe Perſons, whom by
the Tone of their Voices, tho' I could not ſee
them, I knew to be Men.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Madam, I was a Witneſs to a moſt
horrible Scheme which they concerted together;
my Weakneſs will not permit me to enter into
an exact Detail of all I heard: The Reſult of
their Conference was, To ſeize the Princeſs of
this Country and carry her off.</p>
               <p>Here, purſued <hi>Cynecia,</hi> I interrupted the
Stranger with a loud Cry, which giving him
to underſtand who I was, he apologiz'd in the
moſt graceful Manner imaginable for the little
Reſpect he had hitherto paid me.</p>
               <p>I then intreated him to tell me, If he had any
Opportunity of hearing the Name of my deſign'd

the valiant Stranger, I return'd the ſame Way

which I fear not all his Infidelities will ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of.</p>
               <p>His Attachment to me was ſoon ſuſpected by
<hi>Taxander</hi>'s Relations, who having ſecretly
vow'd his Ruin, endeavour'd to diſcover if I
had admitted his Addreſſes, and having made
themſelves Maſters of our Secrets, by means of
the Treachery of one of my Women, procur'd
Information to be given to my Father of our
mutual Paſſion.</p>
               <p>Alas! what Miſchiefs did not this fatal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
produce: My Father, enrag'd to the

my Apartments, and order'd <hi>Ariamenes</hi> to leave
his Dominions within three Days.</p>
               <p>Spare me, Madam, the Repetition of what
paſs'd at our laſt ſad Interview, which by large
Bribes to my Guards, he obtain'd.</p>
               <p>His Tears, his Agonies, his Vows of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Fidelity, ſo ſooth'd my Melancholy at
parting with him, and perſuaded me of his
Conſtancy, that I waited for ſeveral Months
with perfect Tranquillity for the Performance
of the Promiſe he made me, to do my Father
ſuch conſiderable Services in the War he was
engag'd in with one of his Neighbours, as ſhould
oblige him to give me to him for his Reward.</p>
               <p>But, alas! two Years roll'd on without
bringing back the unfaithful <hi>Ariamenes.</hi> My
Father died, and my Brother who ſucceeded
him, being about to force me to marry a Prince
whom I deteſted, I ſecretly quitted the Court, and
attended only by this faithful Confidant whom

                  <hi>Polenor,</hi> the moſt prudent and faithful of my

expect the End of them in Death. My At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
found me out ſuch a Retreat as I
wanted, in a neighbouring Village, which they
call <hi>Twickenham,</hi> I think, from whence I often
make Excurſions to this Park, attended only as

               <p>The ſorrowful <hi>Cynecia</hi> here ended her Story,

given a great many Interruptions through the
Violence of her Grief: And <hi>Arabella,</hi> after

The Evening being almoſt clos'd, they parted

As he had expected to unravel ſome great
Myſtery, he was agreeably diſappointed to find
ſhe continu'd her Walk in the Park with great
Compoſure; and tho' ſhe was ſoon join'd by the
imaginary Princeſs, yet conceiving her to be ſome
young Lady, with whom ſhe had commenc'd an
Acquaintance at <hi>Richmond,</hi> his Heart was at Reſt;
and for fear of diſpleaſing her, he took a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Path from that ſhe was in, that he might

ſhe would be inclin'd to return, and then ſhew

for which he did not imagine ſhe need be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
               <p>The two Ladies being met, after reciprocal
Compliments, the Princeſs intreated <hi>Arabella</hi>
to relate her Adventures; who not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to violate the Laws of Romance, which
require an unbounded Confidence upon theſe
Occaſions, began very ſuccinctly to recount the
Hiſtory of her Life; which, as ſhe manag'd
it, contain'd Events almoſt as Romantick and
Incredible as any in her Romances; winding
them up with a Confeſſion that ſhe did not hate
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> whom ſhe acknowledg'd to be

               <p>
                  <hi>Cynecia</hi> with a Sigh, congratulated her upon
the Fidelity of a Lover, who by her Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was worthy the Place he poſſeſs'd in her
Eſteem: And expreſſing a Wiſh, that ſhe could
ſee, unobſerv'd by him, this gallant and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Perſon, <hi>Arabella,</hi> who that Moment eſpy'd
him at a Diſtance, yet advancing towards them,
told her, with a Bluſh that overſpread all her

               <p>
                  <hi>Cynecia,</hi> at theſe Words, looking towards
the Place where her fair Friend had directed;
no ſooner caſt her Eyes upon Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
than giving a loud Cry, ſhe ſunk into the Arms
of <hi>Arabella,</hi> who, aſtoniſh'd and perplex'd as
ſhe was, eagerly held them out to ſupport her.</p>
               <p>Finding her in a Swoon, ſhe diſpatch'd. <hi>Lucy,</hi>
who was near her, to look for ſome Water to
throw in her Face; but that Lady breathing a
deep Sigh, open'd her languiſhing Eyes, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Saying this, without giving her Time to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
ſhe took hold of her Confidant by the
Arm, and went away with ſo much Swiftneſs,

Our charming Heroine, ignorant till now of
the true State of her Heart, was ſurpriz'd to
find it aſſaulted at once by all the Paſſions which
attend diſappointed Love. Grief, Rage, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,
and Deſpair made ſo cruel a War in her
gentle Boſom, that unable either to expreſs or
to conceal the ſtrong Emotions with which ſhe
was agitated, ſhe gave Way to a violent Burſt
of Tears, leaning her Head upon <hi>Lucy</hi>'s Shoulder,
who wept as heartily as her Lady, tho' igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was now near enough
to take Notice of her Poſture, came running
with eager Heart to ſee what was the matter;
when <hi>Arabella,</hi> rous'd from her Extacy of Grief
by the Sound of his Steps, lifted up her Head,
and ſeeing him approach,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> cried ſhe, trembling with the Violence
of her Reſentment, Tell that Traitor to keep

ſhe, with a Sigh that ſhook her whole

little to waſh away his Guilt, or to pacify my
Indignation.</p>
               <p>Then haſtily turning away, ſhe ran towards

directly Home.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> amaz'd at this Action, was

been ſo unfortunate as to offend you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> no longer able to contain herſelf,
burſt into Tears at this Queſtion: With one
Hand ſhe made repeated Signs to him to be
gone, with the other ſhe held her Handkerchief
to her Eyes, vex'd and aſham'd of her Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> exceſſively ſhock'd at this
Sight, inſtead of leaving her, threw himſelf on
his Knees before her, and taking her Hand,
which he tenderly preſt to his Lips,</p>
               <p>Good God! my deareſt Couſin, ſaid he,
How you diſtract me by this Behaviour! Sure
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0005700702:278"/>
ſomething extraordinary muſt be the Matter.
What can it be that thus afflicts you?—Am I
the Cauſe of theſe Tears?—Can I have offended
you ſo much?—Speak, dear Madam—Let me
know my Crime. Yet may I periſh if I am
conſcious of any towards you—</p>
               <p>Diſloyal Man, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi> diſ-engaging her
Hand from his, Does then the Crime of <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
ſeem ſo light in thy Apprehenſion, that
thou can'ſt hope to be thought innocent by
<hi>Arabella?</hi> No, no, ungrateful Man, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<hi>Cynecia</hi> ſhall have no Cauſe to ſay,
that I will triumph in her Spoils. I myſelf will
be the Miniſter of her Revenge; and <hi>Glanville</hi>
ſhall ſuffer for the Crime of <hi>Ariamenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who the Devil is this <hi>Ariamenes,</hi> cry'd
<hi>Glanville</hi> riſing in a Paſſion? And why am I to
ſuffer for his Crime, pray? For Heav'ns Sake,
dear Couſin, don't let your Imagination wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thus. Upon my Soul, I don't believe there
is any ſuch Perſon as <hi>Ariamenes</hi> in the World,</p>
               <p>Vile Equivocator, ſaid <hi>Arabella; Ariamenes,</hi>
tho' dead to <hi>Cynecia,</hi> is alive to the deluded
<hi>Arabella.</hi> The Crimes of <hi>Ariamenes</hi> are the
Guilt of <hi>Glanville:</hi> And if the one has made
himſelf unworthy of the Princeſs of <hi>Gaul,</hi> by
his Perfidy and Ingratitude, the other by his
Baſeneſs and Deceit, merits nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Deteſtation from <hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Frenzy, by my Soul, cry'd <hi>Glanville</hi> mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
between his Teeth: This is downright
Frenzy. What ſhall I do?—</p>
               <p>Hence, from my Preſence, reſum'd <hi>Arabella,</hi>
falſe and ungrateful Man; perſecute me no
more with the hateful Offers of thy Love. From
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0005700702:279"/>
this Moment I baniſh thee from my Thoughts
for ever; and neither as <hi>Glanville</hi> or as <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
will I ever behold thee more.</p>
               <p>Stay, dear Couſin, ſaid <hi>Glanville</hi> holding her
(for ſhe was endeavouring to ruſh by him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
he ſhould ſee the Tears that had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread
her Face as ſhe pronounc'd thoſe Words)
hear me, I beg you, but one Word. Who is
it you mean by <hi>Ariamenes?</hi>—Is it me?—Tell
me, Madam, I beſeech you—This is ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Miſtake—You have been impos'd upon by
ſome villainous Artifice—Speak, dear Lady
<hi>Bella</hi>—Is it me you mean by <hi>Ariamenes?</hi> For
ſo your laſt Words ſeem'd to hint—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> without regarding what he ſaid,
ſtruggled violently to force her Hand from his:
and finding him ſtill earneſt to detain her, told
him with an enrag'd Voice, That ſhe would
call for Help, if he did not unhand her directly.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Glanville,</hi> at this Menace, ſubmiſſively
dropt her Hand; and the Moment ſhe was free,
ſhe flew out of the Room, and locking herſelf
up in her Cloſet, ſent her Commands to him
by one of her Women, whom ſhe call'd to
her, to leave her Apartment immediately.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who ſtood fix'd like a Statue
in the Place where <hi>Arabella</hi> had left him,
was rous'd by this Meſſage, which tho' palliated

a little by the Girl that deliver'd it, who was
not quite ſo punctual as <hi>Lucy,</hi> nevertheleſs fill'd
him with extreme Confuſion. He obey'd how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
immediately, and retiring to his own Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
endeavour'd to recall to his Memory all
Lady <hi>Bella</hi> had ſaid.</p>
               <p>The Ambiguity of her Style, which had led
him into a Suſpicion he had never entertain'd
before, her laſt Words had partly explain'd, if
as he underſtood ſhe did, ſhe meant him by
<hi>Ariamenes.</hi> Taking this for granted, he eaſily
conceiv'd ſome Plot grounded on her Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Notions had been laid, to prepoſſeſs her
againſt him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Behaviour to her ruſh'd that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into his Thoughts: He inſtantly recollected
all his Fooleries, his Hiſtory, his Letter, his
Converſation, all apparently copied from thoſe
Books ſhe was ſo fond of, and probably done
with a View to ſome other Deſign upon her.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reflections, join'd to his new awak'd
Suſpicions, that he was in Love with her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
him he was the Author of their preſent
Miſ-underſtanding; and that he had impos'd
ſome new Fallacy upon <hi>Arabella,</hi> in order to
promote a Quarrel between them.</p>
               <p>Fir'd almoſt to Madneſs at this Thought, he
ſtamp'd about his Room, vowing Revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sir <hi>George,</hi> execrating Romances, and curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Stupidity for not diſcovering Sir
<hi>George</hi> was his Rival, and knowing his plotting
Talent, not providing againſt his Artifices.</p>
               <p>His firſt Reſolutions were to ſet out imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
for Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Seat, and force him to
confeſs the Part he had acted againſt him: But a
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0005700702:281"/>
Moment's Conſideration convinc'd him, that
was not the moſt probable Place to find him in,
ſince it was much more likely he was waiting
the Succeſs of his Schemes in <hi>London,</hi> or perhaps
at <hi>Richmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next to ſatiating his Vengeance, the Pleaſure
of detecting him in ſuch a Manner, that he
could not poſſibly deny or palliate his Guilt, was
next his Heart.</p>
               <p>He reſolv'd therefore to give it out, that he
was gone to <hi>London,</hi> to make Lady <hi>Bella</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it was in Obedience to her Commands
that he had left her, with a Purpoſe not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
till he had clear'd his Innocence; but in
reality to conceal himſelf in his own Apartment,
and ſee what Effects his reputed Abſence would
produce.</p>
               <p>Having thus taken his Reſolution, he ſent
for Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> his Father's Steward, to whoſe
Care he had entruſted Lady <hi>Bella</hi> in her Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and acquainting him with Part of his
Apprehenſions with Regard to Sir <hi>George</hi>'s At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
upon his Couſin; he imparted to him
his Deſign of ſtaying conceal'd there, in order
to diſcover more effectually thoſe Attempts, and
to preſerve Lady <hi>Bella</hi> from any Conſequence
of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> approv'd of his Deſign; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
him of his Vigilance and Care, both in
concealing his Stay, and alſo in giving him No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of every Thing that paſs'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> then wrote a ſhort Billet to
<hi>Arabella,</hi> expreſſing his Grief for her Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
his Departure in Obedience to her Orders,
and his Reſolution not to appear in her Preſence,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0005700702:282"/>
till he could give her convincing Proofs of his
Innocence.</p>
               <p>This Letter he ſent by <hi>Roberts,</hi> which <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
condeſcended to read, but would return no
Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> then mounting his Horſe,
which <hi>Roberts</hi> had order'd to be got ready, rode
away, and leaving him at a Houſe he ſometimes
put up at, return'd on Foot, and was let in by
Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> at the Garden-door, and conducted
unſeen to his Chamber.</p>
               <p>While he paſs'd that Night and great Part of
the next Day, meditating on the Treachery of
Sir <hi>George,</hi> and ſoothing his Uneaſineſs with the
Hopes of Revenge, <hi>Arabella,</hi> no leſs diſquieted,
mus'd on the Infidelity of her Lover, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of <hi>Cynecia,</hi> and the Impoſſibility of her
ever being happy. Then ranſacking her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
for Inſtances in her Romances of Ladies
equally unfortunate with herſelf, ſhe would
ſometimes compare herſelf to one Lady, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to another, adapting their Sentiments,
and making Uſe of their Language in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
               <p>Great Part of the Day being ſpent in this
Manner, the uneaſy Reſtleſsneſs of her Mind
made her wiſh to ſee <hi>Cynecia</hi> again. She long'd
to ask her a hundred Queſtions about the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
<hi>Ariamenes,</hi> which the Suddaineſs of her
Departure, and her own Aſtoniſhment prevented
her from doing, when ſhe made that fatal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
which had coſt her ſo much Uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a faint Hope would ariſe in her
Mind that <hi>Cynecia</hi> might be miſtaken, thro' the
great Reſemblance that poſſibly was between
<hi>Ariamenes</hi> and <hi>Glanville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0005700702:283"/>
She remember'd that <hi>Mandana</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the Likeneſs of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>Spitridates;</hi>
and concluded that illuſtrious Prince inconſtant,
becauſe <hi>Spitridates,</hi> whom ſhe took for <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
ſaw her carry'd away, without offering to
reſcue her.</p>
               <p>Dwelling with Eagerneſs upon this Thought,
becauſe it afforded her a temporary Relief from
others more tormenting, ſhe reſolv'd to go to
the Park, tho' ſhe had but little Hopes of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Cynecia</hi> there; ſuppoſing it but too proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the Diſturbance which the Sight, or
fancy'd Sight of <hi>Ariamenes</hi> had given her, would
confine her for ſome Days to her Chamber.
Yet however ſmall the Probability was of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with her, ſhe could not reſiſt the impatient
Deſire ſhe felt of going to ſeek her.</p>
               <p>Diſpenſing therefore with the Attendance of
any other Servant but <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſhe left her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with a Deſign of reſuming her uſual
Walk, when ſhe was met at her ſtepping out of
the Door by Lady <hi>L</hi>—'s three Daughters, (who
had viſited her during her Reſidence at <hi>Richmond)</hi>
and another young Lady.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ladies, who to vary the Scene of their
Rural Diverſions, were going to croſs over to
<hi>Twickenham,</hi> and walk there, preſt Lady <hi>Bella</hi>
to accompany them. Our melancholy Heroine
refus'd them at firſt, but upon their repeated
Importunity, recollecting that the Princeſs of
<hi>Gaul</hi> had inform'd her ſhe reſided there, ſhe
conſented to go, in Hopes ſome favourable
Chance might bring her in their Way, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Place of her Retreat, when ſhe could
eaſily find ſome Excuſe for leaving her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and going to her.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who did not doubt but
<hi>Roberts</hi> would bring him ſome Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
ſat waiting with anxious Impatience for
his Return. The Evening drew on apace, he
number'd the Hours, and began to grow uneaſy
at <hi>Arabella</hi>'s long Stay. His Chamber Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
looking into the Garden, he thought he
ſaw his Couſin, cover'd with her Veil as uſual,
haſten down one of the Walks; his Heart
leap'd at this tranſient View, he threw up the
Saſh, and looking out, ſaw her very plainly
ſtrike into a croſs Walk, and a Moment after
ſaw Sir <hi>George,</hi> who came out of a little Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-houſe,
at her Feet. Tranſported with
Rage at this Sight, he ſnatch'd up his Sword,
flew down the Stairs into the Garden, and
came running like a Madman up the Walk in
which the Lovers were. The Lady obſerving
him firſt, for Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Back was towards
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0005700702:285"/>
him, ſhriek'd aloud, and not knowing what
ſhe did, ran towards the Houſe, crying for
Help, and came back as faſt, yet not Time
enough to prevent Miſchief: For Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
actuated by an irreſiſtible Fury, cry'd out
to Sir <hi>George</hi> to defend himſelf, who had but
juſt Time to draw his Sword and make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
Paſs at Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> when he receiv'd
his into his Body, and fell to the Ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> loſing his Reſentment inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at the Sight of his Rival's Blood, threw
down his Sword, and endeavour'd to ſupport
him; while the Lady, who had loſt her Veil
in her running, and to the great Aſtoniſhment
of Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> prov'd to be his Siſter, came
up to them, with Tears and Exclamations,
blaming herſelf for all that had happen'd.
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> with a Heart throbbing with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
for what he had done, gaz'd on his Siſter
with an accuſing Look, as ſhe hung over the
wounded Baronet with ſtreaming Eyes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wringing her Hands, then claſping them
together in an Agony of Grief.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> having Strength enough left to
obſerve her Diſorder, and the generous Concern
of <hi>Glanville,</hi> who holding him in his Arms,
intreated his Siſter to ſend for proper Aſſiſtance,
Dear <hi>Charles,</hi> ſaid he, you are too kind, I
have us'd you very ill, I have deſerv'd my
Death from your Hand—You know not what
I have been baſe enough to practiſe againſt you—
If I can but live to clear your Innocence to

                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0005700702:286"/>
His Strength failing him at theſe Words, he
fainted away in Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Arms; who tho'
now convinc'd of his Treachery, was extremely
ſhock'd at the Condition he ſaw him in.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> renewing her Tears and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
at this Sight, he was oblig'd to lay
Sir <hi>George</hi> gently upon the Ground, and ran to
find out ſomebody to ſend for a Surgeon, and
to help him to convey him into the Houſe.</p>
               <p>In his Way he was met by Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> who
was coming to ſeek him; and with a Look of
Terror and Confuſion told him, Lady <hi>Bella</hi>
was brought Home extremely ill—that her Life
had been in Danger, and that ſhe was but juſt
recover'd from a terrible fainting Fit.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> tho' greatly alarm'd at this
News, forgot not to take all poſſible Care of
Sir <hi>George;</hi> directing <hi>Roberts</hi> to get ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to carry him into the Houſe, and giving
him Orders to procure proper Aſſiſtance, flew
to Lady <hi>Bella</hi>'s Apartment.</p>
               <p>Her Women had juſt put her to Bed, raving
as in a ſtrong Delirium. Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
her, and finding ſhe was in a violent
Fever, diſpatch'd a Man and Horſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to Town, to get Phyſicians, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
his Father with what had happen'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> upon the Surgeon's Report that
Sir <hi>George</hi> was not mortally wounded, came
to inform him of this good News, but he ſound
him incapable of liſtning to him, and in Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
not to be expreſt. 'Twas with Difficulty
they forc'd him out of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Chamber into
his own; where throwing himſelf upon his
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he refus'd to ſee or ſpeak to any Body, till
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0005700702:287"/>
he was told Sir <hi>Charles</hi> and the Phyſicians were
arriv'd.</p>
               <p>He then ran eagerly to hear their Opinions of
his beloved Couſin, which he ſoon diſcover'd
by their ſignificant Geſtures and half pronounc'd
Words, to be very bad. They comforted him
however, with Hopes that ſhe might recover,
and inſiſting upon her being kept very quiet,
oblig'd him to quit the Room. While all the
neceſſary Methods were taken to abate the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Diſeaſe, Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who had been
inform'd by his Steward of his Son's Duel with
Sir <hi>George,</hi> was amaz'd to the laſt Degree at
two ſuch terrible Accidents.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen his Son to his Chamber, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
him to be patient and compos'd,
he went to viſit the young Baronet, and was
not a little ſurpriz'd to find his Daughter ſitting
at his Bed's Head, with all the Appearance of
a violent Affliction.</p>
               <p>Indeed Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Cares were ſo wholly
engroſs'd by Sir <hi>George</hi>'s, that ſhe hardly
ever thought of her Couſin <hi>Arabella,</hi> and had
juſt ſtept into her Chamber while the Surgeons
were dreſſing Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Wound, and renew'd
her Attendance upon him as ſoon as that was
over.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> however, thought proper to
make ſome trifling Excuſes to her Father for
her Solicitude about Sir <hi>George.</hi> And the
young Baronet, on whom the Fear of Death
produc'd its uſual Effects, and made him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
concern'd for the Errors of his paſt
Life, and very deſirous of attoning for them if
poſſible, aſſur'd Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> that if he liv'd he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0005700702:288"/>
would offer himſelf to his Acceptance for a Son-in-law;
declaring that he had baſely trifled
with the Eſteem of his Daughter, but that ſhe

Tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was very deſirous of knowing the
Occaſion of his Quarrel with his Son, but Sir
<hi>George</hi> was too weak to hold any further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,

                  <hi>Arabella</hi> was ſo diſguſted with this (as ſhe
thought) inſipid Diſcourſe, which gave no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to the Anxiety of her Mind, but added a
Kind of Fretfulneſs and Impatience to her
Grief; that ſhe reſolv'd to quit them, and with
<hi>Lucy,</hi> go in queſt of the Princeſs of <hi>Gaul</hi>'s
Retreat.</p>
               <p>The Ladies however, inſiſted upon her not
leaving them; and her Excuſe that ſhe was
going in ſearch of an unfortunate Unknown,
for whom ſhe had vow'd a Friendſhip, made
them all immediately reſolve to accompany her,
extremely diverted with the Oddity of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and ſacrificing her to their Mirth by ſly
Leers, Whiſpers, ſtifled Laughs, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
little ſprightly Sallies, which the diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<hi>Arabella</hi> took no Notice of, ſo deeply were
her Thoughts engag'd.</p>
               <p>Tho' ſhe knew not which Way to direct her
Steps, yet concluding the melancholy <hi>Cynccia</hi>
would certainly chuſe ſome very ſolitary Place
for her Reſidence, ſhe rambled about among
the leaſt frequented Paths, follow'd by the young
Ladies, who ardently deſir'd to ſee this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Unknown; tho' at <hi>Arabella</hi>'s earneſt
Requeſt, they promis'd not to ſhew themſelves
to the Lady, who, ſhe inform'd them, for
very urgent Reaſons, was oblig'd to keep herſelf
conceal'd.</p>
               <p>Fatiguing as this Ramble was to the delicate
Spirits of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Companions, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to ſupport it by the Diverſion her Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
afforded them.</p>
               <p>Every Peaſant ſhe met, ſhe enquir'd if a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Lady diſguis'd did not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0005700702:290"/>
To ſome ſhe gave a Deſcription of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to others an Account of the Domeſticks
that were with her; not forgetting her Dreſs,
her Melancholy, and the great Care ſhe took
to keep herſelf conceal'd.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſtrange Enquiries, with the ſtrange
Language in which they were made, not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſurpriz'd the good People to whom ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd
herſelf, yet mov'd to Reſpect by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick
Lovelineſs of her Perſon, they anſwer'd
her in the Negative, without any Mixture of
Scoff and Impertinence.</p>
               <p>How unfavourable is Chance, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi>
fretting at the Diſappointment, to Perſons who
have any Reliance upon it! This Lady that I
have been in Search of ſo long without Succeſs,
may probably be found by others who do not
ſeek her, whoſe Preſence ſhe may wiſh to
avoid, yet not be able.</p>
               <p>The young Ladies finding it grew late, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
their Apprehenſions at being without any
Attendants; and deſir'd <hi>Arabella</hi> to give over
her Search for that Day. <hi>Arabella</hi> at this Hint
of Danger, enquir'd very earneſtly, If they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
any Attempts to carry them away?
And without ſtaying for an Anſwer, urg'd them
to walk Home as faſt as poſſible, apologizing
for the Danger into which ſhe had ſo indiſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn both them and herſelf; yet added her
Hopes, that if any Attempt ſhould be made
upon their Liberty, ſome generous Cavalier
would paſs by who would reſcue them: A Thing
ſo common, that they had no Reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0005700702:291"/>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> conſtruing the Silence with which
her Companions heard theſe Aſſurances, into a
Doubt of their being ſo favoured by Fortune,
proceeded to inform them of ſeveral Inſtances
wherein Ladies met with unexpected Relief and
Deliverance from Raviſhers.</p>
               <p>She mention'd particularly the Reſcue of
<hi>Statira</hi> by her own Brother, whom ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
for many Years dead; that of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<hi>Berenice</hi> by an abſolute Stranger, and many
others, whoſe Names, Characters and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſhe occaſionally run over; all which the
young Ladies heard with inconceivable Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
And the Detail had ſuch an Effect
upon <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Imagination, bewilder'd as i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
was in the Folies of Romances, that 'ſpying
three or four Horſemen riding along the Road
towards them, ſhe immediately concluded they
would be all ſeiz'd and carry'd off.</p>
               <p>Poſſeſs'd with this Belief, ſhe utter'd a loud
Cry, and flew to the Water-ſide, which alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ladies, who could not imagine what
was the Matter, they ran after her as faſt as
poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> ſtop'd when ſhe came to the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and looking round about, and not perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Boat to waft them over to <hi>Richmond,</hi> a
Thought ſuddenly darted into her Mind, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
thoſe ingenious Books which gave it Birth.</p>
               <p>Turning therefore to the Ladies, who all at
once were enquiring the Cauſe of her Fright;</p>
               <p>'Tis now, my fair Companions, ſaid ſhe,
with a ſolemn Accent, that the Deſtinies have
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0005700702:292"/>
furniſh'd you with an Opportunity of diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Manner truly Heroick, the Sublimity
of your Virtue, and the Grandeur of your
Courage to the World.</p>
               <p>The Action we have it in our Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
will immortalize our Fame, and raiſe us
to a Pitch of Glory equal to that of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd
<hi>Clelia</hi> herſelf.</p>
               <p>Like her, we may expect Statues erected to
our Honour: Like her, be propos'd as Patterns
to Heroines in enſuing Ages: And like her,
perhaps, meet with Sceptres and Crowns for
our Reward.</p>
               <p>What that beauteous <hi>Roman</hi> Lady perform'd
to preſerve herſelf from Violation by the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Sextus,</hi> let us imitate to avoid the Violence
our intended Raviſhers yonder come to offer us.</p>
               <p>Fortune, which has thrown us into this Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
preſents us the Means of gloriouſly
eſcaping: And the Admiration and Eſteem of
all Ages to come, will be the Recompence of
our noble Daring.</p>
               <p>Once more, my fair Companions, If your
Honour be dear to you, if an immortal Glory
be worth your ſeeking, follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
I ſhall ſet you, and equal with me the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Clelia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe plung'd into the <hi>Thames,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to ſwim over it, as <hi>Clelia</hi> did the <hi>Tyber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The young Ladies, who had liſten'd with
ſilent Aſtoniſhment at the long Speech ſhe had
made them, the Purport of which not one of
them underſtood, ſcream'd out aloud at this
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0005700702:293"/>
horrid Spectacle, and wringing their Hands,
ran backwards and forwards like diſtracted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
crying for Help. <hi>Lucy</hi> tore her Hair,
and was in the utmoſt Agony of Grief, when
Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> who, as we have ſaid before, kept
them always in Sight, having obſerv'd <hi>Arabella</hi>
running towards the Water-ſide, follow'd them
as faſt as he could, and came Time enough up
to ſee her frantick Action. Jumping into the
River immediately after her, he caught hold of
her Gown, and drew her after him to the Shore.
A Boat that Inſtant appearing, he put her into
it, ſenſeleſs, and to all Appearance dead. He
and <hi>Lucy</hi> ſupporting her, they were waſted over
in a few Moments to the other Side: Her Houſe
being near the River, Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> carry'd her
in his Arms to it; and as ſoon as he ſaw her
ſhew Signs of returning Life, left her to the
Care of the Women, who made haſte to put
her into a warm Bed, and ran to find out
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> as we have related.</p>
               <p>There remains now only to account for
Sir <hi>George</hi> and Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s ſudden Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which happen'd, gentle Reader, exactly
as follows.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> having ſet out pretty late in
the Afternoon, with a Deſign of ſtaying all
Night at <hi>Richmond,</hi> as her Chaiſe drove up
<hi>Kew-Lane,</hi> ſaw one of her Couſin's Women,
<hi>Deborah</hi> by Name, talking to a Gentleman,
whom, notwithſtanding the Diſguiſe of a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Coat, and a Hat ſlouch'd over his Face,
ſhe knew to be Sir <hi>George Bellmour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0005700702:294"/>
This Sight alarming her Jealouſy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
all her former Suſpicions, that her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin's
Charms rival'd hers in his Heart, as ſoon
as ſhe alighted, finding <hi>Arabella</hi> was not at
Home, ſhe retir'd in great Anguiſh of Mind to
her Chamber, revolving in her Mind every
Particular of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Behaviour to her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin
in the Country, and finding new Cauſe for
Suſpicion in every Thing ſhe recollected, and
reflecting upon the Diſguiſe in which ſhe ſaw
him, and his Conference with her Woman, ſhe
concluded herſelf had all along been the Dupe
of his Artifice, and her Couſin the real Object
of his Love.</p>
               <p>This Thought throwing her into an Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Rage, all her tendereſt Emotions were
loſt in the Deſire of Revenge. She imagin'd
to herſelf ſo much Pleaſure from expoſing his
Treachery, and putting it our of his Power to
deny it, that ſhe reſolv'd, whatever it coſt her,
to have that Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing therefore <hi>Deborah</hi> was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
ſhe rung her Bell, and commanded her
Attendance on her in her Chamber.</p>
               <p>The Stern Brow with which ſhe receiv'd
her, frighten'd the Girl, conſcious of her Guilt,
into a Diſpoſition to confeſs all, even before ſhe
was tax'd with any thing.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> ſaw her Terror, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to heighten it, by entering at once into
Complaints and Exclamations againſt her,
threatning to acquaint her Father with her Plots
to betray her Lady, and aſſuring her of a very
ſevere Puniſhment for her Treachery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0005700702:295"/>
The Girl, terrify'd extremely at theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,
begg'd Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> with Tears, to
forgive her, and not to acquaint Sir <hi>Charles</hi> or
her Lady, with her Fault; adding, that ſhe
would confeſs all, and never while ſhe liv'd, do
ſuch a Thing again.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> would make her no Promiſes,
but urg'd her to confeſs: Upon which <hi>Deborah</hi>
ſobbing, own'd, That for the Sake of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
Sir <hi>George</hi> had made her, ſhe conſented to
meet him privately from Time to Time, and
give him an Account of every Thing that
paſs'd with Regard to her Lady; not thinking
there was any Harm in it. That according to
his Deſires, ſhe had conſtantly acquainted him
with all her Lady's Motions, when, and where
ſhe went, how ſhe and Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> agreed,
and a hundred other Things which he enquir'd
about. That that Day in particular, he had
intreated her to procure him the M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans of an
Interview with her Lady, if poſſible; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was not at <hi>Richmond,</hi>
ſhe had let him privately into the Garden,
where ſhe hop'd to prevail upon her Lady
to go.</p>
               <p>What, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> ſurpriz'd, Is Sir
<hi>George</hi> waiting for my Couſin in the Garden
then?</p>
               <p>Yes, indeed, Madam, ſaid <hi>Deborah:</hi> But
I'll go and tell him to wait no longer; and
never ſpeak to him again, if your Ladyſhip
will but be pleas'd to forgive me.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> having taken her Reſolution,
not only promis'd <hi>Deborah</hi> her Pardon, but alſo
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0005700702:296"/>
a Reward, provided ſhe would contrive it ſo,
that ſhe might meet Sir <hi>George</hi> inſtead of her
Couſin.</p>
               <p>The Girl, having the true Chamber-Maid
Spirit of Intrigue in her, immediately propos'd
her putting on one of her Lady's Veils; which
as it was now the Cloſe of the Evening, would
diſguiſe her ſufficiently; to which Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
tranſported with the Thoughts of thus having
an Opportunity of convincing Sir <hi>George</hi> of his
Perfidy, and reproaching him for it, conſented,
and bid her bring it without being obſerv'd, into
her Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deborah</hi> informing her, that Sir <hi>George</hi> was
conceal'd in the Summer-Houſe, as ſoon as ſhe
had equipp'd herſelf with <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Veil ſhe
went into the Walk that led to it; and Sir <hi>George,</hi>
believing her to be that Lady, haſten'd to throw
himſelf at her Feet, and had ſcarce got through
half a Speech he had ſtudy'd for his preſent
Purpoſe, when Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> gave a fatal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption

                  <hi>RICHMOND</hi> was now a Scene of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Confuſion and Diſtreſs. <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
Fever was riſen to ſuch a Height, that ſhe was
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0005700702:297"/>
given over by the Phyſicians; and Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
Wounds, tho' not judg'd mortal at firſt, yet by
the great Effuſion of Blood had left him in ſo
weak a Condition, that he was thought to be
in great Danger.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> almoſt diſtracted with the Fears
of the Conſequences of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Death, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
his Son to quit the Kingdom; but
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> proteſting he would rather die
than leave <hi>Arabella</hi> in that Illneſs, he was
oblig'd to give Bail for his Appearance, in Caſe
Sir <hi>George</hi> dy'd: This Affair, notwithſtanding
all Endeavours to prevent it, having made a
great Noiſe.</p>
               <p>Poor Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> oppreſt as he was with the
Weight of all theſe Calamities, was yet oblig'd
to labour inceſſantly to keep up the Spirits of
his Son and Daughter. The ſettled Deſpair of
the one, and the ſilent ſwelling Grief of the
other, cut him to the Heart. He omitted no
Arguments his Paternal Affection ſuggeſted to
him, to moderate their Affliction. Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
often endeavour'd to aſſume a Compoſure
he was very far from feeling, in order to ſatisfy
his Father. But Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> looking upon
herſelf to be the Cauſe of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
declar'd, She ſhould be miſerable all her
Life, if he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> in her lucid Intervals, being ſenſible
of her Danger, prepar'd for Death, with great
Piety and Conſtancy of Mind, having ſolemnly
aſſur'd Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> of her Forgiveneſs, who
would not at that Time enter into an Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0005700702:298"/>
of the Affair which had given her Offence
for fear of perplexing her. She permitted his
Preſence often in her Chamber, and deſir'd with
great Earneſtneſs the Aſſiſtance of ſome worthy
Divine in her Preparations for Death. The
Pious and Learned Doctor—at Sir <hi>Charles</hi>'s
Intimation of his Niece's Deſire, came con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
twice a Day to attend her. Her Fever,
by a favourable Criſis, and the great Skill of her
Phyſicians, left her in a Fortnight; but this
violent Diſtemper had made ſuch a Ravage in
her delicate Conſtitution, and reduc'd her ſo low
that there ſeem'd very little Probability of her
Recovery. Doctor—, in whom her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feign'd
Piety, her uncommon Firmneſs of Mind,
had created a great Eſteem and Tenderneſs for
her, took all Opportunities of comforting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting,
and praying by her. The Occaſion of
her Illneſs being the Subject of every body's
Converſation at <hi>Richmond,</hi> he gently hinted it
to her, and urg'd her to explain her Reaſons for
ſo extravagant an Action.</p>
               <p>In the Divine Frame <hi>Arabella</hi> was then in,
this Action appear'd to her raſh and vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and ſhe acknowledg'd it to be ſo to her
pious Monitor: Yet ſhe related the Motives
which induc'd her to it, the Danger ſhe was in
of being carry'd away, the Parity of her Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
then with <hi>Clelia,</hi> and her emulous
Deſire of doing as much to preſerve her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
as that renown'd <hi>Roman</hi> Lady did for
hers.</p>
               <p>The good Doctor was extremely ſurpriz'd at
this Diſcourſe: He was beginning to think her
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0005700702:299"/>
again delirious; but <hi>Arabella</hi> added to this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ſuch ſenſible Reaſoning on the Nature
of that Fondneſs for Fame, which prompted
her to ſo raſh an Undertaking, that the Doctor
left her in ſtrange Embarraſſment, not knowing
how to account for a Mind at once ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd,
and ſo ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> meeting him as he came out
of her Chamber, the Doctor took this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to acknowledge the Difficulties <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
inconſiſtent Diſcourſe had thrown him into.
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> taking him into his own Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
explain'd the Nature of that ſeeming
Inconſiſtency, and expatiated at large upon the
Diſorders Romances had occaſion'd in her Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
ſeveral Inſtances of which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,
and fill'd the Doctor with the greateſt
Aſtoniſhment and Concern. He lamented pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically
the Ruin ſuch a ridiculous Study had
brought on ſo noble a Mind; and aſſur'd Mr.
<hi>Glanville,</hi> he would ſpare no Endeavours to reſcue
it from ſo ſhocking a Deluſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> thank'd him for his good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
with a Tranſport which his Fears of his
Couſin's Danger almoſt mingled with Tears;
and the Doctor and he agreed to expect for ſome
few Days longer an Alteration for the better in
the Health of her Body, before he attempted
the Cure of her Mind. Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s extreme
Anxiety had made him in Appearance neglect
the repentant Sir <hi>George,</hi> contenting himſelf
with conſtantly ſending twice a Day to enquire
after his Health, but had not yet viſited him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0005700702:300"/>
No ſooner had the Phyſicians declared that
<hi>Arabella</hi> was no longer in Danger, than his
Mind being freed from that tormenting Load
of Suſpence under which it had labour'd while
her Recovery was yet doubful, he went to
Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Chamber, who by reaſon of his
Weakneſs, tho' he was alſo upon the Recovery,
ſtill kept his Bed.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> tho' he ardently wiſh'd to ſee him,
yet conſcious of the Injuries he had both done
and deſign'd him, could not receive his Viſit
without extreme Confuſion: But entering into
the Cauſe of their Quarrel, as ſoon as he was
able to ſpeak, he freely acknowledg'd his Fault,
and all the Steps he had taken to ſupplant him
in <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Affection.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> underſtanding by this Means,
that he had brib'd a young Actreſs to perſonate
a Princeſs forſaken by him; and had taught her
all that Heap of Abſurdity with which ſhe had
impos'd upon <hi>Arabella,</hi> as has been related, deſir'd
only by Way of Reparation, That when his
Couſin was in a Condition to be ſpoken to upon
that Subject, he would condeſcend to own the
Fraud to her; which Sir <hi>George</hi> faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing,
an Act of Oblivion paſs'd on Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi>'s Side for all former Injuries, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Aſſurance from Sir <hi>George</hi> of inviolable
Friendſhip for the future. An Aſſurance, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
which Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> would willingly have
diſpens'd with: For tho' not of a vindictive
Temper, it was one of his Maxims, That a
Man who had once betray'd him, it would be

               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Being in the Author's Opinion, the beſt
Chapter in this Hiſtory.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE good Divine, who had the Cure of
<hi>Arabella</hi>'s Mind greatly at Heart, no
ſooner perceiv'd that the Health of her Body was
almoſt reſtor'd, and that he might talk to her
without the Fear of any Inconvenience, than
he introduc'd the Subject of her throwing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into the River, which he had before lightly
touch'd upon, and ſtill declar'd himſelf diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> now more diſpos'd to defend this
Point than when languiſhing under the Preſſure
of Pain and Dejection of Mind, endeavour'd
by Arguments founded upon Romantick Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,
to prove, That it was not only reaſonable
and juſt, but alſo great and glorious, and exactly
conformable to the Rules of Heroick Virtue.</p>
               <p>The Doctor liſten'd to her with a mix'd
Emotion, between Pity, Reverence, and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And tho' in the Performance of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
he had been accuſtom'd to accommodate
his Notions to every Underſtanding, and had
therefore accumulated a great Variety of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks
and Illuſtrations; yet he found himſelf
now engag'd in a Controverſy for which he was
not ſo well prepar'd as he imagin'd, and was at
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0005700702:302"/>
a Loſs for ſome leading Principle, by which he
might introduce his Reaſonings, and begin his
Confutation.</p>
               <p>Tho' he ſaw much to praiſe in her Diſcourſe,
he was afraid of confirming her Obſtinacy by
Commendation: And tho' he alſo found much
to blame, he dreaded to give Pain to a Delicacy
he rever'd.</p>
               <p>Perceiving however, that <hi>Arabella</hi> was ſilent,
as if expecting his Reply, he reſolv'd not to
bring upon himſelf the Guilt of abandoning her
to her Miſtake, and the Neceſſity of ſpeaking
forc'd him to find ſomething to ſay.</p>
               <p>Tho' it is not eaſy, Madam, ſaid he, for any
one that has the Honour of converſing with
your Ladyſhip to preſerve his Attention free to
any other Idea, than ſuch as your Diſcourſe
tends immediately to impreſs, yet I have not
been able while you was ſpeaking, to refrain
from ſome very mortifying Reflections on the
Imperfection of all human Happineſs, and the
uncertain Conſequences of all thoſe Advantages
which we think ourſelves not only at Liberty
to deſire, but oblig'd to cultivate.</p>
               <p>Tho' I have known ſome Dangers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes,
reply'd <hi>Arabella</hi> gravely, yet I did not
imagine myſelf ſuch a Mirror of Calamity as
could not be ſeen without Concern. If my Life
has not been eminently fortunate, it has yet
eſcap'd the great Evils of Perſecution, Captivity,
Shipwrecks and Dangers to which many Ladies
far more Illuſtrious both by Birth and Merit
than myſelf, have been expos'd. And indeed,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0005700702:303"/>
tho' I have ſometimes rais'd Envy, or poſſibly
incurr'd Hatred, yet I have no Reaſon to believe
I was ever beheld with Pity before.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſaw he had not introduc'd his
Diſcourſe in the moſt acceptable Manner; but
it was too late to repent.</p>
               <p>Let me not, Madam, ſaid he, be cenſur'd
before I have fully explain'd my Sentiments.</p>
               <p>That you have been envy'd, I can readily
believe: For who that gives Way to natural
Paſſions has not Reaſon to envy the Lady <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella?</hi>
But that you have been hated, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
leſs willing to think, tho' I know how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
the greater Part of Mankind hate thoſe by
whom they are excell'd.</p>
               <p>If the Miſery of my Condition, reply'd
<hi>Arabella,</hi> has been able to excite that Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
your firſt. Words ſeem'd to imply, Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
will contribute very little towards the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of it. Nor do I expect from the
Severity of the Sacerdotal Character, any of
thoſe Praiſes, which I hear perhaps with too
much Pleaſure, from the reſt of the World.</p>
               <p>Having been ſo lately on the Brink of that
State, in which all Diſtinctions but that of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
are deſtroy'd, I have not recover'd ſo much
Laevity, but that I would yet rather hear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
than Compliments.</p>
               <p>If therefore you have obſerv'd in me any
dangerous Tenets, corrupt Paſſions, or crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Deſires, I conjure you diſcover me to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Let no falſe Civility reſtrain your Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions.
Let me know this Evil which can
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0005700702:304"/>
ſtrike a good Man with Horror, and which I
dread the more, as I do not feel it.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſuppoſe that a Man of your Order
would be alarm'd at any other Miſery than Guilt:
Nor will I think ſo meanly of him whoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
I have intreated, as to imagine he can
think Virtue unhappy, however overwhelm'd
by Diſaſters or Oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>Keep me therefore no longer in Suſpence: I
expect you will exert the Authority of your
Function, and I promiſe you on my Part, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>The good Man was now compleatly embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd;
he ſaw his Meaning miſtaken, but was
afraid to explain it, left he ſhould ſeem to pay
Court by a cowardly Retraction: He therefore
paus'd a little, and <hi>Arabella</hi> ſuppoſed he was
ſtudying for ſuch Expreſſions as might convey
Cenſure without Offence.</p>
               <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, if you are not yet ſatisfy'd of
my Willingneſs to hear your Reproofs, let me
evince my Docility, by intreating you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
yourſelf as diſpens'd from all Ceremony
upon this Occaſion.</p>
               <p>Your Imaginations, Madam, reply'd the
Doctor, are too quick for Language; you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
too ſoon, what you do not wait to
hear; and reaſon upon Suppoſitions which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be allow'd you.</p>
               <p>When I mention'd my Reflections upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Miſery, I was far from concluding your
Ladyſhip miſerable, compar'd with the reſt of
Mankind; and though contemplating the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0005700702:305"/>
Idea of poſſible Felicity, I thought that
even You might be produc'd as an Inſtance that
it is not attainable in this World, I did not
impute the Imperfection of your State to
Wickedneſs, but intended to obſerve, That
though even Virtue be added to external Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
there will yet be ſomething wanting
to Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Whoever ſees you, Madam, will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſay, That nothing can hinder you from
being the happieſt of Mortals, but Want of
Power to underſtand your own Advantages.
And whoever is admitted to your Converſation,
will be convinc'd that you enjoy all that Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Excellence can confer; yet I ſee you
harraſs'd with innumerable Terrors and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
which never diſturb the Peace of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of Ignorance.</p>
               <p>I cannot diſcover, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> how Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
or Ignorance can be privileg'd from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualty
or Violence, from the Raviſher, the
Robber, or the Enemy. I ſhould hope rather
that if Wealth and Knowledge can give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, they at leaſt confer Judgment to
foreſee Danger, and Power to oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>They are not indeed, return'd the Doctor,
ſecur'd againſt real Misfortunes, but they are
happily defended from wild Imaginations:
They do not ſuſpect what cannot happen, nor
figure Raviſhers at a Diſtance, and leap into
Rivers to eſcape them.</p>
               <p>Do you ſuppoſe then, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that I
was frighted without Cauſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0005700702:306"/>
It is certain, Madam, reply'd he, that no
Injury was intended you.</p>
               <p>Diſingennuity, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> does not
become a Clergyman—I think too well of your
Underſtanding to imagine your Fallacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
yourſelf: Why then ſhould you hope that
it will deceive me?</p>
               <p>The Laws of Conference require that the
Terms of the Queſtion and Anſwer be the
ſame.</p>
               <p>I ask, if I had not Cauſe to be frighted?
Why then am I anſwer'd that no Injury was
intended?</p>
               <p>Human Beings cannot penetrate Intentions,
nor regulate their Conduct but by exterior
Appearances. And ſurely there was ſufficient
Appearance of intended Injury, and that the
greateſt which my Sex can ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Why, Madam, ſaid the Doctor, ſhould you
ſtill perſiſt in ſo wild an Aſſertion?</p>
               <p>A coarſe Epithet, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> is no
Confutation. It reſts upon you to ſhew, That
in giving Way to my Fears, even ſuppoſing
them groundleſs, I departed from the Character
of a reaſonable Perſon.</p>
               <p>I am afraid, replied the Doctor, of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
with your Ladyſhip, not becauſe I
think myſelf in Danger of Defeat, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
being accuſtom'd to ſpeak to Scholars
with Scholaſtick Ruggedneſs, I may perhaps
depart in the Heat of Argument, from that
Reſpect to which you have ſo great a Right,
and give Offence to a Perſon I am really
afraid to diſpleaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0005700702:307"/>
But, if you will promiſe to excuſe my
Ardour, I will endeavour to prove that you
have been frighted without Reaſon.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be content, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> to
obtain Truth upon harder Terms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
intreat you to begin.</p>
               <p>The Apprehenſion of any future Evil, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid the Divine, which is called Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
when the Danger is from natural Cauſes,
and Suſpicion, when it proceeds from a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Agent, muſt always ariſe from Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
               <p>We can judge of the Future only by the
Paſt, and have therefore only Reaſon to fear
or ſuſpect, when we ſee the ſame Cauſes in
Motion which have formerly produc'd Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
or the ſame Meaſures taken as have
before been preparatory to a Crime.</p>
               <p>Thus, when the Sailor in certain Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
ſees the Clouds riſe, Experience bids
him expect a Storm. When any Monarch
levies Armies, his Neighbours prepare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
an Invaſion.</p>
               <p>This Power of Prognoſtication, may, by
Reading and Converſation, be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our own Knowledge: And the great
Uſe of Books, is that of participating without
Labour or Hazard the Experience of others.</p>
               <p>But upon this Principle how can you find
any Reaſon for your late Fright.</p>
               <p>Has it ever been known, that a Lady of
your Rank was attack'd with ſuch Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in a Place ſo publick, without any
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0005700702:308"/>
Preparations made by the Violator for Defence
or Eſcape?</p>
               <p>Can it be imagin'd that any Man would
ſo raſhly expoſe himſelf to Infamy by Failure,
and to the Gibbet by Succeſs?</p>
               <p>Does there in the Records of the World
appear a ſingle Inſtance of ſuch hopeleſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany?</p>
               <p>It is now Time, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,,</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
your Queſtions, before they are too many
to be remembered.</p>
               <p>The Dignity of my Birth can very little
defend me againſt an Inſult to which the
Heireſſes of great and powerful Empires,
the Daughters of valiant Princes, and the
Wives of renowned Monarchs, have been a
thouſand Times expoſed.</p>
               <p>The Danger which you think ſo great,
would hardly repel a determin'd Mind; for in
Effect, Who would have attempted my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue,
ſeeing that no Knight or valiant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
was within View?</p>
               <p>What then ſhould have hinder'd him from
placing me in a Chariot? Driving it into
the pathleſs Deſart? And immuring me in
a Caſtle, among Woods and Mountains?
Or hiding me perhaps in the Caverns of a
Rock? Or confining me in ſome Iſland of
an immenſe Lake?</p>
               <p>From all this, Madam, interrupted the
Clergyman, he is hinder'd by Impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0005700702:309"/>
He cannot carry you to any of theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Places, becauſe there is no ſuch Caſtle,
Deſart, Cavern, or Lake.</p>
               <p>You will pardon me, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
it I recur to your own Principles:</p>
               <p>You allow that Experience may be gain'd
by Books: And certainly there is no Part
of Knowledge in which we are oblig'd to
truſt them more than in Deſcriptive Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy.</p>
               <p>The moſt reſtleſs Activity in the longeſt
Life, can ſurvey but a ſmall Part of the
habitable Globe: And the reſt can only be
known from the Report of others.</p>
               <p>Univerſal Negatives are ſeldom ſafe, and
are leaſt to be allow'd when the Diſputes
are about Objects of Senſe; where one Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
cannot be inferr'd from another.</p>
               <p>That there is a Caſtle, any Man who
has ſeen it may ſafely affirm. But you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with equal Reaſon, maintain that there
is no Caſtle, becauſe you have not ſeen it.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould I imagine that the Face of
the Earth is alter'd ſince the Time of thoſe
Heroines, who experienc'd ſo many Changes
of uncouth Captivity?</p>
               <p>Caſtles indeed, are the Works of Art;
and are therefore ſubject to Decay. But
Lakes, and Caverns, and Deſarts, muſt always
remain.</p>
               <p>And why, ſince you call for Inſtances, ſhould
I not dread the Misfortunes which happen'd
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0005700702:310"/>
to the divine <hi>Clelia,</hi> who was carry'd to one
of the Iſles of the <hi>Thraſymenian</hi> Lake?</p>
               <p>Or thoſe which befel the beautiful <hi>Candace,</hi>
Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> whom the Pyrate <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donus</hi>
wander'd with on the Seas?</p>
               <p>Or the Accidents which imbitter'd the Life
of the incomparable <hi>Cleopatra?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or the Perſecutions which made that of the
fair <hi>Eliſa</hi> miſerable?</p>
               <p>Or, in fine, the various Diſtreſſes of many
other fair and virtuous Princeſſes: Such as
thoſe which happen'd to <hi>Olympia, Bellamira,
Pariſatis, Berenice, Amalagantha, Agione, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſinda,
Placidia, A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſinoe, Deidamia,</hi> and a
thouſand others I could mention.</p>
               <p>To the Names of many of theſe illuſtrious
Sufferers I am an abſolute Stranger, replied the
Doctor.</p>
               <p>The reſt I ſaintly remember ſome Mention
of in thoſe contemptible Volumes, with which
Children are ſometimes injudiciouſly ſuffer'd
to amuſe their Imaginations; but which I
little expected to hear quoted by your Ladyſhip
in a ſerious Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>And though I am very far from catching
Occaſions of Reſentment, yet I think myſelf
at Liberty to obſerve, That if I merited your
Cenſure for one indelicate Epithet, we have
engag'd on very unequal Terms, if I may
not likewiſe complain of ſuch contemptuous
Ridicule as you are pleas'd to exerciſe upon
my Opinions by oppoſing them with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Scribblers, not only of Fictions,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0005700702:311"/>
but of ſenſeleſs Fictions; which at once vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
the Mind, and pervert the Unſtander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
and which if they are at any Time
read with Safety, owe their Innocence only to
their Abſurdity.</p>
               <p>From theſe Books, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> which
you condemn with ſo much Ardour, though
you acknowledge yourſelf little acquainted
with them, I have learnt not to recede from
the Conditions I have granted, and ſhall not
therefore cenſure the Licence of your Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which glances from the Books upon the
Readers.</p>
               <p>Theſe Books, Sir, thus corrupt, thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
thus dangerous alike to the Intellect
and Morals, I have read; and that I hope
without Injury to my Judgment, or my Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>The Doctor, whoſe Vehemence had hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him from diſcovering all the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Poſition, now found himſelf entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
and reply'd in a ſubmiſſive Tone,</p>
               <p>I confeſs, Madam, my Words imply an
Accuſation very remote from my Intention.</p>
               <p>It has always been the Rule of my Life, not
to juſtify any Words or Actions becauſe they
mine.</p>
               <p>I am aſham'd of my Negligence, I am
ſorry for my Warmth, and intreat your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Fault which I hope never
to repeat.</p>
               <p>The Reparation, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi> ſmiling,
over-balances the Offence, and by thus daring
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0005700702:312"/>
to own you have been in the Wrong, you
have rais'd in me a much higher Eſteem for
you.</p>
               <p>Yet I will not pardon you, added ſhe,
without enjoining you a Penance for the Fault
you own you have committed; and this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
ſhall be to prove,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That theſe Hiſtories you condemn
are Fictions.</p>
               <p>Next, That they are abſurd.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, That they are Criminal.</p>
               <p>The Doctor was pleas'd to find a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
offer'd upon ſo very eaſy Terms, with
a Perſon whom he beheld at once with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Affection, and could not offend
without extreme Regret.</p>
               <p>He therefore anſwered with a very chearful
Compoſure:</p>
               <p>To prove thoſe Narratives to be Fictions,
Madam, is only difficult, becauſe the Poſition
is almoſt too evident for Proof.</p>
               <p>Your Ladyſhip knows, I ſuppoſe to what
Authors theſe Writings are aſcrib'd?</p>
               <p>To the <hi>French</hi> Wits of the laſt Century,
ſaid <hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at what Diſtance, Madam, are the
Facts related in them from the Age of the
Writer?</p>
               <p>I was never exact in my Computation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Arablela;</hi> but I think moſt of the Events
happen'd about two thouſand Years ago.</p>
               <p>How then, Madam, reſum'd the Doctor,
could theſe Events be ſo minutely known to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0005700702:313"/>
Writers ſo far remote from the Time in which
they happen'd?</p>
               <p>By Records, Monuments, Memoirs, and
Hiſtories, anſwered the Lady.</p>
               <p>But by what Accident, then, ſaid the Doctor
ſmiling, did it happen theſe Records and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
were kept univerſally ſecret to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
till the laſt Century?</p>
               <p>What brought all the Memoirs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt
Nations and earlieſt Ages only to
<hi>France?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where were they hidden that none could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
them but a few obſcure Authors?</p>
               <p>And whither are they now vaniſhed again
that they can be found no more?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> having ſat ſilent a while, told him,
That ſhe found his Queſtions very difficult to
be anſwer'd; and that though perhaps the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
themſelves could have told whence they
borrowed their Materials, ſhe ſhould not at
preſent require any other Evidence of the firſt
Aſſertion:</p>
               <p>But allow'd him to ſuppoſe them Fictions,
and requir'd now that he ſhould ſhew them to

               <p>Your Ladyſhip, return'd he, has, I find,
too much Underſtanding to ſtruggle againſt
Demonſtration, and too much Veracity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
your Convictions; therefore ſome of the
Arguments by which I intended to ſhew the
Falſhood of theſe Narratives may be now uſed
to prove their Abſurdity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0005700702:314"/>
You grant them, Madam, to be Fictions?</p>
               <p>Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella</hi> eagerly, You are
again infringing the Laws of Diſputation.</p>
               <p>You are not to confound a Suppoſition
of which I allow you only the preſent Uſe,
with an unlimited and irrevocable Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>I am too well acquainted with my own
Weakneſs to conclude an Opinion falſe,
merely becauſe I find myſelf unable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it.</p>
               <p>But I am in haſte to hear the Proof of the
other Poſitions, not only becauſe they may
perhaps ſupply what is deficient in your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the firſt, but becauſe I think it of
more Importance to detect Corruption than
Fiction.</p>
               <p>Though indeed Falſhood is a Species of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and what Falſhood is more hateful
than the Falſhood of Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Since you have drawn me back, Madam,
to the firſt Queſtion, returned the Doctor,
Let me know what Arguments your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
can produce for the Veracity of theſe
Books.</p>
               <p>That there are many Objections againſt
it, you yourſelf have allowed, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
moral Evidence of Falſhood appears when
there are many Arguments againſt an Aſſertion,
and none for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0005700702:315"/>
Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> I ſhall never think that
any Narrative, which is not confuted by its
own Abſurdity, is without one Argument at
leaſt on its Side; there is a Love of Truth in
the human Mind, if not naturally implanted,
ſo eaſily obtained from Reaſon and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that I ſhould expect it univerſally to
prevail where there is no ſtrong Temptation to
Deceit; we hate to be deceived, we therefore
hate thoſe that deceive us; we deſire not to
be hated, and therefore know that we are not
to deceive. Shew me an equal Motive to
Falſhood, or confeſs that every Relation has
ſome Right to Credit.</p>
               <p>This may be allowed, Madam, ſaid the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
when we claim to be credited, but that
ſeems not to be the Hope or Intention of theſe
Writers.</p>
               <p>Surely Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> you muſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
their Deſign; he that writes without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to be credited, muſt write to little Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for what Pleaſure or Advantage can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from Facts that never happened? What
Examples can be afforded by the Patience
of thoſe who never ſuffered, or the Chaſtity of
thoſe who were never ſolicited? The great
End of Hiſtory, is to ſhew how much human
Nature can endure or perform. When we
hear a Story in common Life that raiſes our
Wonder or Compaſſion, the firſt Confutation
ſtills our Emotions, and however we were
touched before, we then chaſe it from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
with Contempt as a Trifle, or with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
as an Impoſture. Prove, therefore,
that the Books which I have hitherto read as
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0005700702:316"/>
Copies of Life, and Models of Conduct, are
empty Fictions, and from this Hour I deliver
them to Moths and Mould; and from this
Time conſider their Authors as Wretches who
cheated me of thoſe Hours I ought to have
dedicated to Application and Improvement,
and betrayed me to a Waſte of thoſe Years in
which I might have laid up Knowledge for my
future Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> ſaid the Doctor, calls juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
the Child of Integrity, and therefore
I do not wonder, that what Vehemence the
Gentleneſs of your Ladyſhip's Temper allows,
ſhould be exerted upon this Occaſion. Yet
though I cannot forgive theſe Authors for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
deſtroyed ſo much valuable Time, yet I
cannot think them intentionally culpable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I cannot believe they expected to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited.
Truth is not always injured by Fiction.

The Fables of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> though never
I ſuppoſe believed, yet have been long conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as Lectures of moral and domeſtic
Wiſdom, ſo well adapted to the Faculties of
Man, that they have been received by all civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
Nations; and the <hi>Arabs</hi> themſelves have
honoured his Tranſlator with the Appellation
of <hi>Looman</hi> the Wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0005700702:317"/>
The Fables of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe of which the Abſurdity diſcovers
itſelf, and the Truth is compriſed in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
but what can be ſaid of thoſe Tales
which are told with the ſolemn Air of hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Truth, and if falſe convey no Inſtruction?</p>
               <p>That they cannot be defended Madam, ſaid
the Doctor, it is my Purpoſe to prove, and if to
evince their Falſhood be ſufficient to procure
their Baniſhment from your Ladyſhip's Cloſet,
their Day of Grace is near an end. How is
any oral, or written Teſtimony, confuted or
confirmed?</p>
               <p>By comparing it, ſays the Lady, with the
Teſtimony of others, or with the natural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and ſtanding Evidence of the Facts rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and ſometimes by comparing it with itſelf.</p>
               <p>If then your Ladyſhip will abide by this laſt,
returned he, and compare theſe Books with
antient Hiſtories, you will not only find innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Names, of which no Mention was
ever made before, but Perſons who lived in
different Ages, engaged as the Friends or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of each other. You will perceive that
your Authors have parcelled out the World at
Diſcretion, erected Palaces, and eſtabliſhed
Monarchies wherever the Conveniency of
their Narrative required them, and ſet Kings
and Queens over imaginary Nations. Nor have
they conſidered themſelves as inveſted with leſs
Authority over the Works of Nature, than the
Inſtitutions of Men; for they have diſtributed
Mountains and Deſarts, Gulphs and Rocks,
wherever they wanted them, and whenever the
Courſe of their Story required an Expedient,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0005700702:318"/>
raiſed a gloomy Foreſt, or overflowed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
with a rapid Stream.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> you have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to deceive me, and ſince, if what you
have aſſerted be true, the Cauſe is undefenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I ſhall trouble you no longer to argue on
this Topic, but deſire now to hear why, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
them Fictions, and intended to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as Fictions, you cenſure them as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd?</p>
               <p>The only Excellence of Falſhood, anſwered
he, is its Reſemblance to Truth; as therefore
any Narrative is more liable to be confuted by
its Inconſiſtency with known Facts, it is at a
greater Diſtance from the Perfection of Fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for there can be no Difficulty in framing
a Tale, if we are left at Liberty to invert all
Hiſtory and Nature for our own Conveniency.
When a Crime is to be concealed, it is eaſy
to cover it with an imaginary Word. When
Virtue is to be rewarded, a Nation with
a new Name may, without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Invention, raiſe her to the Throne.
When <hi>Arioſto</hi> was told of the Magnificence of
his Palaces, he anſwered, that the Coſt of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical
Architecture was very little; and
ſtill leſs is the Coſt of Building without Art,
than without Materials. But their hiſtorical
Failures may be eaſily paſſed over, when we
conſider their phyſical or philoſophical Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities;
to bring Men together from different
Countries does not ſhock with every inherent or
demonſtrable Abſurdity, and therefore when
we read only for Amuſement, ſuch Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries
may be born: But who can forbear to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0005700702:319"/>
throw away the Story that gives to one Man
the Strength of Thouſands; that puts Life
or Death in a Smile or a Frown; that recounts
Labours and Sufferings to which the Powers
of Humanity are utterly unequal; that disfigures
the whole Appearance of the World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
every Thing in a Form different from
that which Experience has ſhewn. It is the
Fault of the beſt Fictions, that they teach
young Minds to expect ſtrange Adventures
and ſudden Viciſſitudes, and therefore encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them often to truſt to Chance. A long
Life may be paſſed without a ſingle Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that can cauſe much Surprize, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any unexpected Conſequence of great
Importance; the Order of the World is ſo
eſtabliſhed, that all human Affairs proceed in
a regular Method, and very little Opportunity
is left for Sallies or Hazards, for Aſſault or
Reſcue; but the Brave and the Coward, the
Sprightly and the Dull, ſuffer themſelves to
be carried alike down the Stream of Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who had for ſome Time liſtened
with a Wiſh to interrupt him, now took
Advantage of a ſhort Pauſe. I cannot imagine,
Sir, ſaid ſhe, that you intend to deceive me,
and therefore I am inclined to believe that you
are yourſelf miſtaken, and that your Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Learning has hindered you from that
Acquaintance with the World, in which theſe
Authors excelled. I have not long converſed
in Public, yet I have found that Life is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to many Accidents. Do you count my
late Eſcape for nothing? Is it to be numbered
among daily and curſory Tranſactions, that a
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0005700702:320"/>
Woman flies from a Raviſher into a rapid
Stream?</p>
               <p>You muſt not, Madam, ſaid the Doctor,
urge as an Argument the Fact which is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Subject of Diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> bluſhing at the Abſurdity ſhe had
been guilty of, and not attempting any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge
or Excuſe, the Doctor found himſelf
at Liberty to proceed:</p>
               <p>You muſt not imagine, Madam, continued
he, that I intend to arrogate any Superiority,
when I obſerve that your Ladyſhip muſt ſuffer
me to decide, in ſome Meaſure authoritatively,
whether Life is truly deſcribed in thoſe Books;
the Likeneſs of a Picture can only be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Knowledge of the Original. You
have yet had little Opportunity of knowing the
Ways of Mankind, which cannot be learned
but from Experience, and of which the higheſt
Underſtanding, and the loweſt, muſt enter the
World in equal Ignorance. I have lived
long in a public Character, and have thought
it my Duty to ſtudy thoſe whom I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to admoniſh or inſtruct. I have never
been ſo rich as to affright Men into Diſguiſe
and Concealment, nor ſo poor as to be kept
at a Diſtance too great for accurate Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.
I therefore preſume to tell your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
with great Confidence, that your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have inſtituted a World of their own, and
that nothing is more different from a human
Being, than Heroes or Heroines.</p>
               <p>I am afraid, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that the
Difference is not in Favour of the preſent
World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0005700702:321"/>
That, Madam, anſwered he your own
Penetration will enable you to judge when it
ſhall have made you equally acquainted with
both: I have no deſire to determine a Queſtion,
the Solution of which will give ſo little
Pleaſure to Purity and Benevolence.</p>
               <p>The Silence of a Man who loves to praiſe
is a Cenſure ſufficiently ſevere, ſaid the
Lady. May it never happen that you ſhould
be unwilling to mention the Name of <hi>Arabella.</hi>
I hope wherever Corruption prevails in the
World, to live in it with Virtue, or, if I find
myſelf too much endanger'd, to retire from it
with Innocence. But if you can ſay ſo little
in Commendation of Mankind, how will
you prove theſe Hiſtories to be vicious, which
if they do not deſcribe real Life, give us an Idea
of a better Race of Beings than now inhabit
the World.</p>
               <p>It is of little Importance, Madam, replied
the Doctor, to decide whether in the real or
fictitious Life, moſt Wickedneſs is to be
found. Books ought to ſupply an Antidote
to Example, and if we retire to a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of Crimes, and continue in our
Cloſets to inflame our Paſſions, at what time
muſt we rectify our Words, or purify our
Hearts? The immediate Tendency of theſe
Books which your Ladyſhip muſt allow me to
mention with ſome Severity, is to give new
Fire to the Paſſions of Revenge and Love;
two Paſſions which, even without ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Auxiliaries, it is one of the ſevereſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of Reaſon and Piety to ſuppreſs, and
which yet muſt be ſuppreſſed if we hope to be
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0005700702:322"/>
approved in the Sight of the only Being
where Approbation can make us Happy. I
am afraid your Ladyſhip will think me too
ſerious.—I have already learned too much
from you, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> to preſume to
inſtruct you, yet ſuffer me to caution you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to diſhonour your ſacred Office by the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of Apologies. Then let me again ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
reſumed he, that theſe Books ſoften the
Heart to Love, and harden it to Murder.
that they teach Women to exact Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
and Men to execute it; teach Women to
expect not only Worſhip, but the dteadful
Worſhip of human Sacrifices. Every Page of
theſe Volumes is filled with ſuch extravagance
of Praiſe, and expreſſions of Obedience as one
human Being ought not to hear from another;
or with Accounts of Battles, in which thouſands
are ſlaughtered for no other Purpoſe than to
gain a Smile from the haughty Beauty, who
ſits a calm Spectatreſs of the Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
Bloodſhed and Miſery, incited by
herſelf.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to read theſe Tales with
out leſſening part of that Humility, which
by preſerving in us a Senſe of our Alliance
with all human nature, keeps us awake to Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
and Sympathy, or without impairing
that Compaſſion which is implanted in us as
an Incentive to Acts of Kindneſs. If there be
any preſerved by natural Softneſs, or early
Education from learning Pride and Cruelty,
they are yet in danger of being betrayed to the
Vanity of Beauty, and taught the Arts of
Intrigue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0005700702:323"/>
Love, Madam, is, you know, the Buſineſs, the
ſole Buſineſs of Ladies in Romances. <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
Bluſhes now hinder'd him from proceeding as
he had intended. I perceive, continued, he that
my Arguments begin to be leſs agreeable to
your Ladyſhip's Delicacy, I ſhall therefore
inſiſt no longer upon falſe Tenderneſs of
Sentiment, but proceed to thoſe Outrages of
the violent Paſſions which, though not more
dangerous, are more generally hateful.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary, Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi>
that you ſtrengthen by any new Proof a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which when calmly conſidered cannot be
denied; my Heart yields to the Force of Truth,
and I now wonder how the Blaze of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic
Bravery, could hinder me from remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Abhorrence the Crime of deliberate
unneceſſary Bloodſhed.</p>
               <p>I begin to perceive that I have hitherto at
leaſt trifled away my Time, and fear that I have
already made ſome Approaches to the Crime of
encouraging Violence and Revenge. I hope,
Madam, ſaid the good Man with Horror in his
Looks, that no Life was ever loſt by your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement.
<hi>Arabella</hi> ſeeing him thus moved,
burſt into Tears, and could not immediately
anſwer. Is it poſſible, cried the Doctor, that
ſuch Gentleneſs and Elegance ſhould be ſtained
with Blood? Be not too haſty in your Cenſure,
ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> recovering herſelf, I tremble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to think how nearly I have apprroached
the Brink of Murder, when I thought myſelf
only conſulting my own Glory; but whatever
I ſuffer, I will never more demand or inſtigate
Vengeance, nor conſider my Punctilios as
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0005700702:324"/>
important enough to be ballanced againſt Life.</p>
               <p>The Doctor confirmed her in her new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
and thinking Solitude was neceſſary
to compoſe her Spirits after the Fatigue of ſo
long a Converſation, be retired to acquaint Mr
<hi>Glanville</hi> with his Succeſs, who in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

as he called it, that he had performed.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MR <hi>Glanville,</hi> who fancied to himſelf the
moſt raviſhing Delight from converſing
with his lovely Couſin, now recovered to the
free Uſe of all her noble Powers of Reaſon,
would have paid her a Viſit that afternoon,
had not a moments Reflection convinced him
that now was the Time, when her Mind was
labouring under the force of Conviction,
to introduce the repentant Sir <hi>George</hi> to her,
who by confeſſing the ridiculous Farce he had
invented to deceive her, might reſtore him to
her good Opinion, and add to the Doctor's
ſolid Arguments the poignant Sting of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule
which ſhe would then perceive ſhe had
incurred.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> being now able to leave his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and <hi>Arabella</hi> well enough recovered to
admit a Viſit in hers, Mr <hi>Glanville</hi> intreated
his Father to wait on her, and get Permiſſion
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0005700702:325"/>
for Sir <hi>George</hi> to attend her upon a Buſineſs
of ſome Conſequence. Sir <hi>Charles</hi> no ſooner
mentioned this Requeſt, than <hi>Arabella</hi> after
a little Heſitation complied with it. As ſhe
had been kept a Stranger to all the Particulars
of Mr <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Quarrels with the young
Baronet, her Thoughts were a little perplex'd
concerning the Occaſion of this Viſit, and
her Embarraſsment was conſiderably increaſed
by the Confuſion which ſhe perceived in the
Countenance of Sir <hi>George.</hi> It was not
without ſome Tokens of a painfully ſuppreſt
Reluctance that Sir <hi>George</hi> conſented to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his Promiſe, when Mr <hi>Glanville</hi> claim'd
it, but the Diſadvantages that would attend
his Breach of it, dejected and humbled as he
now was, preſenting themſelves in a forcible
manner to his Imagination, confirmed his
wavering Reſolutions. And ſince he found
himſelf obliged to be his own Accuſer, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to do it with the beſt Grace he
could. Acknowledging therefore to Lady
<hi>Bella</hi> all the Artifices her Deception by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
had given him Encouragement to
uſe upon her, and explaining very explicitly
the laſt with relation to the pretended Princeſs
of <hi>Gaul,</hi> he ſubmiſſively aſked her Pardon for
the Offence it would now give her, as well
as for the Trouble it had formerly.</p>

                  <hi>Arabella</hi> ſtruck with inconceivable Cnfuſion,
having only bowed her Head to his Apology deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

with a noble Ingenuity expatiated upon the
Follies her vitiated Judgment had led her into,
ſhe apologized to the firſt, for the frequent

turning to Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> whom ſhe beheld
with a Look of mingled Tenderneſs and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
To give you myſelf, with all my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

yet ſince I am ſo happy as to be deſired for a
