            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WRAPT in Olivia's veil, Ellena de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
to the muſic-room, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with the nuns, who were aſſembled
within the grate. Among the monks
and pilgrims without it, were ſome ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in the uſual dreſs of the country,
but ſhe did not perceive any perſon who
reſembled Vivaldi; and ſhe conſidered,
that, if he were preſent, he would not
venture to diſcover himſelf, while her nun's
veil concealed her as effectually from him
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0247200302:3"/>
as from the lady Abbeſs. It would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
therefore, to ſeek an opportunity
of withdrawing it for a moment at the
grate, an expedient, which muſt certainly
expoſe her to the notice of ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>On the entrance of the lady Abbeſs,
Ellena's fear of obſervation rendered her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
to every other conſideration; ſhe
fancied, that the eyes of the Superior were
particularly directed upon herſelf. The
veil ſeemed an inſufficient protection from
their penetrating glances, and ſhe almoſt
ſunk with the terror of inſtant diſcovery.</p>
            <p>The Abbeſs, however, paſſed on, and,
having converſed for a few moments with
the <hi>padre Abate</hi> and ſome viſitors of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction,
took her chair; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
immediately opened with one of
thoſe ſolemn and impreſſive airs, which
the Italian nuns know how to give with ſo
much taſte and ſweetneſs. It reſcued even
Ellena for a moment from a ſenſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and ſhe reſigned herſelf to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0247200302:4"/>
ſcene, of which the <hi>coup-d' oeil.</hi>
was ſtriking and grand. In a vaulted
apartment of conſiderable extent, lighted
by innumerable tapers, and where even
the ornaments, though pompous, partook
of the ſolemn character of the inſtitution,
were aſſembled about fifty nuns, who, in
the intereſting habit of their order, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
with graceful plainneſs. The deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of their air, and their beauty, ſoftened
by the lawn that thinly veiled it, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted
by the ſevere majeſty of the lady
Abbeſs, who, ſeated on an elevated chair,
apart from the audience, ſeemed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
of the ſcene, and by the venerable
figures of the father <hi>Abate</hi> and his attendant
monks, who were arranged without that
ſcreen of wire-work, extending the whole
breadth of the apartment, which is called
the grate. Near the holy father were
placed the ſtrangers of diſtinction, dreſſed
in the ſplendid Neapolitan habit, whoſe
gay colouring and airy elegance oppoſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0247200302:5"/>
well with the dark drapery of the eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics;
their plumed hats loftily overtopping
the half-cowled heads and grey locks of the
monks. Nor was the contraſt of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
leſs ſtriking; the grave, the auſtere,
the ſolemn, and the gloomy, intermingling
with the light, the blooming, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonaire,
expreſſed all the various tempers,
that render life a bleſſing or a burden, and,
as with the ſpell of magic, transform this
world into a tranſient paradiſe or purgatory.
In the back ground of the picture ſtood
ſome pilgrims, with looks leſs joyous and
more demure than they had worn on the
road the preceding day; and among them
were ſome inferior brothers and attendants
of the convent. To this part of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Ellena frequently directed her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but did not diſtinguiſh Vivaldi; and,
though ſhe had taken a ſtation near the
grate, ſhe had not courage indecorouſly
to withdraw her veil before ſo many ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
And thus, if he even were in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0247200302:6"/>
apartment, it was not probable he would
venture to come forward.</p>
            <p>The concert concluded without his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been diſcovered by Ellena; and ſhe
withdrew to the apartment, where the
collation was ſpread, and where the Abbeſs
and her gueſts ſoon after appeared. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
ſhe obſerved a ſtranger, in a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim's
habit, ſtation himſelf near the grate;
his face was partly muffled in his cloak,
and he ſeemed to be a ſpectator rather than
a partaker of the feaſt.</p>
            <p>Ellena, who underſtood this to be Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi,
was watchful for an opportunity of
approaching, unſeen by the Abbeſs; the
place where he had fixed himſelf. Engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in converſation with the ladies around
her, the Superior ſoon favoured Ellena's
wiſh, who, having reached the grate, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to lift her veil for one inſtant. The
ſtranger, letting his cloak fall, thanked her
with his eyes for her condeſcenſion, and
ſhe perceived, that he was not Vivaldi!
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0247200302:7"/>
Shocked at the interpretation, which might
be given to a conduct apparently ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as much as by the diſappointment,
which Vivaldi's abſence occaſioned, ſhe
was haſtily retiring, when another ſtranger
approached with quick ſteps, whom ſhe inſtantly
knew, by the grace and ſpirit of his
air, to be Vivaldi; but, determined not to
expoſe herſelf a ſecond time to the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a miſtake, ſhe awaited for ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſignal of his identity, before ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
herſelf. His eyes were fixed upon
her in earneſt attention for ſome moments,
before he drew aſide the cloak from his face.
But he ſoon did ſo:—and it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vivaldi
himſelf.</p>
            <p>Ellena, perceiving that ſhe was known,
did not raiſe her veil, but advanced a few
ſteps towards the grate. Vivaldi there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
a ſmall folded paper, and before
ſhe could venture to deliver her own billet,
he had retired among the crowd. As ſhe
ſtepped forward to ſecure his letter, ſhe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0247200302:8"/>
obſerved a nun haſtily approach the ſpot
where he had laid it, and ſhe pauſed. The
garment of the Recluſe wafted it from the
place where it had been partly concealed;
and when Ellena perceived the nun's foot
reſt upon the paper, ſhe with difficulty
diſguiſed her apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>A friar, who from without the grate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
the ſiſter, ſeemed with much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs,
yet with a certain air of ſecreſy,
communicating ſome important intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
The fears of Ellena ſuggeſted that
he had obſerved the action of Vivaldi, and
was making known his ſuſpicions; and ſhe
expected, every inſtant, to ſee the nun lift
up the paper, and deliver it to the Abbeſs.</p>
            <p>From this immediate apprehenſion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſhe was releaſed when the ſiſter
puſhed it gently aſide, without examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a circumſtance that not leſs ſurprized
than relieved her. But, when the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
broke up, and the friar, haſtily
retreating among the crowd, diſappeared
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0247200302:9"/>
from the apartment, and the nun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
and whiſpered the Superior, all
her terrors were renewed. She ſcarcely
doubted, that Vivaldi was detected, and
that his letter was deſignedly left where it
had been depoſited, for the purpoſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring
her to betray herſelf. Trembling,
diſmayed, and almoſt ſinking with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
ſhe watched the countenance of
the Abbeſs, while the nun addreſſed her,
and thought ſhe read her own fate in the
frown that appeared there.</p>
            <p>Whatever might be the intentions or the
directions of the Superior, no active mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
was at preſent employed; the Recluſe,
having received an anſwer, retired quietly
among the ſiſters, and the Abbeſs reſumed
her uſual manner. Ellena, however, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſhe was now obſerved, did not dare
to ſeize the paper, though ſhe believed it
contained momentous information, and
feared that the time was now eſcaping,
which might facilitate her deliverance.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0247200302:10"/>
Whenever ſhe ventured to look round,
the eyes of the Abbeſs ſeemed pointed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, and ſhe judged from the poſition
of the nun, for the veil concealed her face,
that ſhe alſo was vigilantly regarding her.</p>
            <p>Above an hour had elapſed in this ſtate
of anxious ſuſpenſe, when the collation
concluded, and the aſſembly broke up;
during the general buſtle of which, Ellena
ventured to the grate, and ſecured the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
As ſhe concealed it in her robe, ſhe
ſcarcely dared to enquire by a haſty glance
whether ſhe had been obſerved, and would
have withdrawn immediately to examine
the contents, had ſhe not perceived, at the
ſame inſtant, the Abbeſs quitting the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
On looking round for the nun, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena
diſcovered that ſhe was gone.</p>
            <p>Ellena followed diſtantly in the Abbeſs's
train; and, as ſhe drew nearer to Olivia, gave
a ſignal, and paſſed on to her cell. There,
once more alone, and having ſecured the
door, ſhe ſat down to read Vivaldi's billet,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0247200302:11"/>
trying to command her impatience, and to
underſtand the lines, over which her ſight
rapidly moved, when in the eagerneſs of
turning over the paper, the lamp dropt
from her trembling hand and expired.
Her diſtreſs now nearly reached deſpair.
To go forth into the convent for a light
was utterly impracticable, ſince it would
betray that ſhe was no longer a priſoner,
and not only would Olivia ſuffer from a
diſcovery of the indulgence ſhe had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but ſhe herſelf would be immediately
confined. Her only hope reſted upon Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via's
arrival before it might be too late to
practice the inſtructions of Vivaldi, if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
they were ſtill practicable; and ſhe
liſtened with intenſe ſolicitude for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
footſtep, while ſhe yet held, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of its contents, the billet, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
would decide her fate. A thouſand
times ſhe turned about the eventful paper,
endeavoured to trace the lines with her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and to gueſs their import, thus enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0247200302:12"/>
in myſtery; while ſhe experienced
all the various torture that the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of having in her very hand the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
on a timely knowledge of which
her life, perhaps, depended, without being
able to underſtand it, could inflict.</p>
            <p>Preſently ſhe heard advancing ſteps, and
a light gleamed from the paſſage before ſhe
conſidered they might be ſome other than
Olivia's; and that it was prudent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the billet ſhe held. The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
however, came too late to be acted
upon; for, before the ruſtling paper was
diſpoſed of, a perſon entered the cell, and
Ellena beheld her friend. Pale, trembling,
and ſilent, ſhe took the lamp form the nun,
and, eagerly running over Vivaldi's note,
learned, that at the time it was written, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jeronimo was in waiting without the
gate of the nun's garden, where Vivaldi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to join him immediately, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
her by a private way beyond the walls.
He added, that horſes were ſtationed at the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0247200302:13"/>
foot of the mountain, to convey her where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhe ſhould judge proper; and conjured
her to be expeditious, ſince other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
beſides the univerſal engagement
of the Recluſes, were at that moment parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
favourable to an eſcape.</p>
            <p>Ellena, deſponding and appalled, gave
the paper to Olivia, requeſting ſhe would
read it haſtily, and adviſe her how to act.
It was now an hour and a half ſince Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
had ſaid, that ſucceſs depended upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
and that he had probably watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the appointed place; in ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval,
how many circumſtances might
have occurred to deſtroy every poſſibility
of a retreat, which it was certain the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of the Abbeſs and the ſiſters no
longered favoured!</p>
            <p>The generous Olivia, having read the
billet, partook of all her young friend's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
and was as willing, as Ellena was
anxious, to dare every danger for the
chance of obtaining deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0247200302:14"/>
Ellena could feel gratitude for ſuch
goodneſs even at this moment of agoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apprehenſion. After a pauſe of deep
conſideration, Olivia ſaid, "In every ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of the convent we are now liable to
meet ſome of the nuns; but my veil,
though thin, has hitherto protected you,
and we muſt hope it may ſtill aſſiſt your
purpoſe. It will be neceſſary, however, to
paſs through the refectory, where ſuch of
the ſiſters as did not partake of the colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are aſſembled at ſupper, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
ſo, till the firſt mattin calls them
to the chapel. If we wait till then, I fear
it will be to no purpoſe to go at all."</p>
            <p>Ellena's fears perfectly agreed with thoſe
of Olivia; and entreating that another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might not be loſt in heſitation, and
that ſhe would lead the way to the nun's
garden, they quitted the cell together.</p>
            <p>Several of the ſiſters paſſed them, as they
deſcended to the refectory, but without
particularly noticing Ellena; who, as ſhe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0247200302:15"/>
drew near that alarming apartment, wrapt
her veil cloſer, and leaned with heavier
preſſure upon the arm of her faithful friend.
At the door they were met by the Abbeſs,
who had been overlooking the nuns aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at ſupper, and miſſing Olivia had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for her. Ellena ſhrunk back to
elude obſervation, and to let the Superior
paſs; but Olivia was obliged to anſwer to
the ſummons. Having, however, unveiled
herſelf, ſhe was permitted to proceed; and
Ellena, who had mingled with the crowd
that ſurrounded the Abbeſs, and thus eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
detection, followed Olivia with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
ſteps, through the refectory. The
nuns were luckily too much engaged by
the entertainment, at this moment, to
look round them, and the fugitive reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unſuſpected, an oppoſite door.</p>
            <p>In the hall, to which they deſcended,
the adventurers were frequently croſſed by
ſervants bearing diſhes from the refectory
to the kitchen; and, at the very moment
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0247200302:16"/>
when they were opening the door, that led
into the garden, a ſiſter, who had obſerved
them, demanded whether they had vet
heard the mattin-bell, ſince they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the chapel.</p>
            <p>Terrified at this critical interruption,
Ellena preſſed Olivia's arm, in ſignal of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and was haſtening forward, when the
latter, more prudent, pauſed, and calmly
anſwering the queſtion, was then ſuffered to
proceed.</p>
            <p>As they croſſed the garden towards the
gate, Ellena's anxiety leſt Vivaldi ſhould
have been compelled to leave it, encreaſed
ſo much, that ſhe had ſcarcely power to
proceed. "O if my ſtrength ſhould fail
before I reach it!" ſhe ſaid ſoftly to Olivia,
"or if I ſhould reach it too late!"</p>
            <p>Olivia tried to cheer her, and pointed
out the gate, on which the moonlight fell;
"At the end of this walk only," ſaid Olivia,
"ſee!—where the ſhadows of the trees
open, is our goal."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0247200302:17"/>
Encouraged by the view of it, Ellena
fled with lighter ſteps along the alley; but
the gate ſeemed to mock her approach, and
to retreat before her. Fatigue overtook her
in this long alley, before ſhe could overtake
the ſpot ſo anxiouſly ſought, and, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and exhauſted, ſhe was once more
compelled to ſtop, and once more in the
agony of terror exclaimed—"O, if my
ſtrength ſhould fail before I reach it!—O,
if I ſhould drop even while it is within my
view."</p>
            <p>The pauſe of a moment enabled her to
proceed, and ſhe ſtopped not again till ſhe
arrived at the gate; when Olivia ſuggeſted
the prudence of aſcertaining who was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and of receiving an anſwer to the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
which Vivaldi had propoſed, before
they ventured to make themſelves known.
She then ſtruck upon the wood, and, in the
anxious pauſe that followed, whiſpering
voices were diſtinctly heard from without,
but no ſignal ſpoke in reply to the nun's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0247200302:18"/>
"We are betrayed!" ſaid Ellena ſoftly,
"but I will know the worſt at once;" and
ſhe repeated the ſignal, when, to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
joy, it was anſwered by three
ſmart raps upon the gate. Olivia, more
diſtruſtful, would have checked the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
hope of her friend, till ſome further
proof had appeared, that it was Vivaldi
who waited without, but her precaution
came too late; a key already grated in the
lock; the door opened, and two perſons
muffled in their garments appeared at it.
Ellena was haſtily retreating, when a well-known
voice recalled her, and ſhe perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the rays of a half-hooded lamp,
which Jeronimo held, Vivaldi.</p>
            <p>"O heavens!" he exclaimed, in a voice
tremulous with joy, as he took her hand,
"is it poſſible that you are again my own!
If you could but know what I have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
during this laſt hour!"—Then obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Olivia, he drew back, till Ellena ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0247200302:19"/>
her deep ſenſe of obligation to the
nun.</p>
            <p>"We have no time to loſe," ſaid Jeroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
ſullenly; "we have ſtayed too long al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
as you will find, perhaps."</p>
            <p>"Farewel, dear Ellena!" ſaid Olivia,
"may the protection of heaven never leave
you!"</p>
            <p>The fears of Ellena now gave way to
affectionate ſorrow, as, weeping on the
boſom of the nun, ſhe ſaid "farewel! O
farewel, my dear, my tender friend! I muſt
never, never ſee you more, but I ſhall always
love you; and you have promiſed, that I
ſhall hear from you; remember the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
della Pieta!"</p>
            <p>"You ſhould have ſettled this matter
within," ſaid Jeronimo, "we have been
here theſe two hours already."</p>
            <p>"Ah Ellena!" ſaid Vivaldi, as he gently
diſengaged her from the nun, "do I then
hold only the ſecond place in your heart?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0247200302:20"/>
Ellena, as ſhe diſmiſſed her tears, replied
with a ſmile more eloquent than words;
and when ſhe had again and again bade
adieu to Olivia, ſhe gave him her hand,
and quitted the gate.</p>
            <p>"It is moonlight," obſerved Vivaldi to
Jeronimo, "your lamp is uſeleſs, and may
betray us."</p>
            <p>"It will be neceſſary in the church," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Jeronimo, "and in ſome circuitous
avenues we muſt paſs, for I dare not lead
you out through the great gates, Signor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as you well know."</p>
            <p>"Lead on, then," replied Vivaldi, and
they reached one of the cypreſs walks, that
extended to the church; but, before they
entered it, Ellena pauſed and looked back
to the garden gate, that ſhe might ſee Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via
once again. The nun was ſtill there,
and Ellena perceived her faintly in the
moonlight, waving her hand in ſignal of a
laſt adieu. Ellena's heart was full; ſhe
wept, and lingered, and returned the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0247200302:21"/>
till the gentle violence of Vivaldi with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
her from the ſpot.</p>
            <p>"I envy your friend thoſe tears," ſaid
he, "and feel jealous of the tenderneſs that
excites them. Weep no more, my El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena."</p>
            <p>"If you knew her worth," replied El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,
"and the obligations I owe her!"—Her
voice was loſt in ſighs, and Vivaldi
only preſſed her hand in ſilence.</p>
            <p>As they traverſed the gloomy walk, that
led to the church, Vivaldi ſaid, "Are you
certain, father, that not any of the brothers
are doing penance at the ſhrines in our
way?"</p>
            <p>"Doing penance on a feſtival, Signor!
they are more likely, by this time, to be
taking down the ornaments."</p>
            <p>"That would be equally unfortunate
for us," ſaid Vivaldi; "cannot we avoid
the church, father?"</p>
            <p>Jeronimo aſſured him, that this was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible;
and they immediately entered
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0247200302:22"/>
one of its lonely aiſles, where he unhooded
the lamp, for the tapers, which had given
ſplendour, at an earlier hour, to the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
ſhrines, had expired, except thoſe
at the high altar, which were ſo remote,
that their rays faded into twilight long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they reached the part of the church
where the fugitives paſſed. Here and
there, indeed, a dying lamp ſhot a tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
gleam upon the ſhrine below, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
again, ſerving to mark the diſtances
in the long perſpective of arches, rather
than to enlighten the gloomy ſolitude;
but no ſound, not even of a whiſper, ſtole
along the pavement.</p>
            <p>They croſſed to a ſide door communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
with the court, and with the rock,
which enſhrined the image of <hi>our Lady of
mount Carmel.</hi> There, the ſudden glare of
tapers iſſuing from the cave, alarmed the
fugitives, who had begun to retreat, when
Jeronimo, ſtepping forward to examine the
place, aſſured them, there was no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0247200302:23"/>
of any perſon being within, and that
lights burned day and night around the
ſhrine.</p>
            <p>Revived by this explanation, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
into the cave, where their conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
opened a part of the wire-work encloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſaint, and led them to the extremity
of the vault, ſunk deep within which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
a ſmall door. While Ellena trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with apprehenſion, Jeronimo applied
a key, and they perceived, beyond the
door, a narrow paſſage winding away into
the rock. The monk was leading on, but
Vivaldi, who had the ſuſpicions of Ellena,
pauſed at the entrance, and demanded
whither he was conducting them.</p>
            <p>To the place of your <hi>deſtination,</hi>" replied
the brother, in a hollow voice; an anſwer
which alarmed Ellena, and did not ſatisfy
Vivaldi. "I have given myſelf to your
guidance," he ſaid, "and have confided
to you what is dearer to me than exiſtence.
Your life," pointing to the ſhort ſword
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0247200302:24"/>
concealed beneath his pilgrim's veſt, "your
life, you may rely upon my word, ſhall
anſwer for your treachery. If your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is evil, pauſe a moment, and repent,
or you ſhall not quit this paſſage alive."</p>
            <p>"Do you menace me!" replied the
brother, his countenance darkening. "Of
what ſervice would be my death to you?
Do you not know that every brother in the
convent would riſe to avenge it?"</p>
            <p>"I know only that I will make ſure of
one-traitor, if there be one," ſaid Vivaldi,
"and defend this lady againſt your hoſt of
monks; and, ſince you alſo know this,
proceed accordingly."</p>
            <p>At this inſtant it occurring to Ellena, that
the paſſage in queſtion probably led to the
priſon-chamber, which Olivia had deſcribed
as ſituated within ſome deep receſs of the
convent, and that Jeronimo had certainly
betrayed them, ſhe refuſed to go further.
"If your purpoſe is honeſt," ſaid ſhe,
"why do you not conduct us through
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0247200302:25"/>
ſome direct gate of the convent; why are
we brought into theſe ſubterraneous laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths?"</p>
            <p>There is no direct gate but that of the
portal," Jeronimo replied, "and this is
the only other avenue leading beyond the
walls." "And why can we not go out
through the portal?" Vivaldi aſked.</p>
            <p>"Becauſe it is beſet with pilgrims, and
lay brothers," replied Jeronimo, "and
though you might paſs them ſafely enough,
what is to become of the lady? But all
this you knew before, Signor; and was
willing enough to truſt me, then. The
paſſage we are entering opens upon the
cliffs, at ſome diſtance. I have run ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
enough already, and will waſte no
more time; ſo if you do not chuſe to go
forward, I will leave you, and you may act
as you pleaſe."</p>
            <p>He concluded with a laugh of deriſion,
and was re-locking the door, when Vivaldi,
alarmed for the probable conſequence of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0247200302:26"/>
his reſentment, and ſomewhat re-aſſured by
the indifference he diſcovered as to their
purſuing the avenue or not, endeavoured
to appeaſe him, as well as to encourage
Ellena; and he ſucceeded in both.</p>
            <p>As he followed in ſilence through the
gloomy paſſage, his doubts were, however,
not ſo wholly vanquiſhed, but that he
was prepared for attack, and while he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
Ellena with one hand, he held his
ſword in the other.</p>
            <p>The avenue was of conſiderable length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and before they reached its extremity, they
heard muſic from a diſtance, winding
along the rocks. "Hark!" cried Ellena,
"Whence come thoſe ſounds? Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten!"</p>
            <p>"From the cave we have left," replied
Jeronimo, "and it is midnight by that;
it is the laſt chaunt of the pilgrims at the
ſhrine of our Lady. Make haſte, Signor,
I ſhall be called for."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0247200302:27"/>
The fugitives now perceived, that all
retreat was cut off, and that, if they had
lingered only a few moments longer in the
cave, they ſhould have been ſurprized by
thoſe devotees, ſome one of whom, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it appeared poſſible might wander
into this avenue, and ſtill interrupt their
eſcape. When Vivaldi told his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Jeronimo, with an arch ſneer, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there was no danger of that, "for the
paſſage," he added, "is known only to
the brothers of the convent."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi's doubts vaniſhed when he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
underſtood, that the avenue led only
from the cliffs without to the cave, and
was uſed for the purpoſe of conveying ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
to the ſhrine, ſuch articles as were
judged neceſſary to excite the ſuperſtitious
wonder of the devotees.</p>
            <p>While he proceeded in thoughtful
ſilence, a diſtant chime ſounded hollowly
through the chambers of the rock. "The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0247200302:28"/>
mattin-bell ſtrikes!" ſaid Jeronimo, in
ſeeming alarm, "I am ſummoned. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora
quicken your ſteps;" an unneceſſary
requeſt, for Ellena already paſſed with
her utmoſt ſpeed; and ſhe now rejoiced
on perceiving a door in the remote wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the paſſage, which ſhe believed
would emancipate her from the convent.
But, as ſhe advanced, the avenue appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
extending beyond it; and the door,
which ſtood a little open allowed her a
glimpſe of a chamber in the cliff, duſkily
lighted.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, alarmed by the light, enquired,
when he had paſſed, whether any perſon
was in the chamber, and received an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal
anſwer from Jeronimo, who, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſoon after pointed to an arched gate
that terminated the avenue. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with lighter ſteps, for hope now
cheared their hearts, and, on reaching the
gate, all apprehenſion vaniſhed. Jeroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
gave the lamp to Vivaldi, while he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0247200302:29"/>
began to unbar and unlock the door, and
Vivaldi had prepared to reward the brother
for his fidelity, before they perceived that
the door refuſed to yield. A dreadful ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
ſeized on Vivaldi. Jeronimo
turning round, coolly ſaid, "I fear we
are betrayed; the ſecond lock is ſhot! I
have only the key of the firſt."</p>
            <p>"We <hi>are</hi> betrayed," ſaid Vivaldi, in a
reſolute tone, "but do not ſuppoſe, that
your diſſimulation conceals you. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by whom we are betrayed. Recollect
my late aſſertion, and conſider once more,
whether it is your intereſt to intercept us."</p>
            <p>"My Signor," replied Jeronimo, "I
do not deceive you when I proteſt by our
holy Saint, that I have not cauſed this
gate to be faſtened, and that I would open
it if I could. The lock, which holds it,
was not ſhot an hour ago. I am the more
ſurprized at what has happened, becauſe
this place is ſeldom paſſed, even by the
holieſt footſtep; and I fear, whoever has
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0247200302:30"/>
paſſed now, has been led hither by ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
and comes to intercept your flight."</p>
            <p>"Your wily explanation, brother, may
ſerve you for an inferior occaſion, but not
on this," replied Vivaldi, "either, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
uncloſe the gate, or prepare for the
worſt. You are not now to learn, that,
however ſlightly I may eſtimate my own
life, I will never abandon this lady to the
horrors, which your community have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
prepared for her."</p>
            <p>Ellena, ſummoning her fleeting ſpirits,
endeavoured to calm the indignation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi,
and to prevent the conſequence of
his ſuſpicions, as well as to prevail with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimo,
to unfaſten the gate. Her efforts
were, however, followed by a long alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but, at length, the art or the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the brother, appeaſed Vivaldi,
who now endeavoured to force the gate,
while Jeronimo in vain repreſented its
ſtrength, and the certain ruin, that muſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0247200302:31"/>
fall upon himſelf, if it ſhould be diſcovered
he had concurred in deſtroying it.</p>
            <p>The gate was immoveable; but, as no
other chance of eſcaping appeared, Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
was not eaſily prevailed with to deſiſt;
all poſſibility of retreating too was gone,
ſince the church and the cave were now
crowded with devotees, attending the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
ſervice.</p>
            <p>Jeronimo, however, ſeemingly did not
deſpair of effecting their releaſe, but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that they would probably be
compelled to remain concealed in this
gloomy avenue all night, and perhaps the
next day. At length, it was agreed, that
he ſhould return to the church, to examine
whether a poſſibility remained of the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
paſſing unobſerved to the great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
and, having conducted them back to
the chamber, of which they had taken
a paſſing glimpſe, he proceeded to the
ſhrine,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0247200302:32"/>
For a conſiderable time after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
they were not without hope; but,
their confidence diminiſhing as his delay
encreaſed, their uncertainty at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
terrible; and it was only for the
ſake of Vivaldi, from whom ſhe ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
concealed all knowledge of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
fate, which ſhe was aware muſt
await her in the convent, that Ellena ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to endure it with calmneſs. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the plauſibility of Jeronimo,
ſuſpicion of his treachery returned upon
her mind. The cold and earthy air of this
chamber was like that of a ſepulchre; and
when ſhe looked round, it appeared exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to correſpond with the deſcription given
by Olivia of the priſon where the nun had
languiſhed and expired. It was walled
and vaulted with the rock, had only one
ſmall grated aperture in the roof to admit
air, and contained no furniture, except one
table, a bench, and the lamp, which dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhewed the apartment. That a lamp
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0247200302:33"/>
ſhould be found burning in a place ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and ſolitary, amazed her ſtill more
when ſhe recollected the aſſertion of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo,
—that even holy ſteps ſeldom paſſed
this way; and when ſhe conſidered alſo,
that he had expreſſed no ſurprize at a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
according to his own aſſertion,
ſo unuſual. Again it appeared, that ſhe
had been betrayed into the very priſon,
deſigned for her by the Abbeſs; and the
horror, occaſioned by this ſuppoſition, was
ſo great, that ſhe was on the point of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing
it to Vivaldi, but an apprehenſion
of the diſtraction, into which his deſperate
courage might precipitate him, reſtrained
her.</p>
            <p>While theſe conſiderations occupied El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,
and it appeared that any certainty
would be leſs painful than this ſuſpenſe,
ſhe frequently looked round the chamber
in ſearch of ſome object, which might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
or confirm her ſuſpicion, that this
was the death-room of the unfortunate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0247200302:34"/>
nun. No ſuch circumſtance appeared, but
as her eyes glanced, with almoſt phrenzied
eagerneſs? ſhe perceived ſomething ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy
in a remote corner of the floor; and
on approaching, diſcovered what ſeemed a
dreadful hieroglyphic, a mattraſs of ſtraw,
in which ſhe thought ſhe beheld the
death-bed of the miſerable recluſe; nay
more, that the impreſſion it ſtill retained,
was that which her form had left there.</p>
            <p>While Vivaldi was yet entreating her
to explain the occaſion of the horror
ſhe betrayed, the attention of each was
withdrawn by a hollow ſigh, that roſe
near them. Ellena caught unconſciouſly
the arm of Vivaldi, and liſtened, aghaſt,
for a return of the ſound, but all remained
ſtill.</p>
            <p>"It ſurely was not fancied!" ſaid Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,
after a long pauſe, "you heard it alſo?"</p>
            <p>"I did!" replied Ellena.</p>
            <p>"It was a ſigh, was it not?" he added.</p>
            <p>"O yes, and ſuch a ſigh!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0247200302:35"/>
"Some perſon is concealed near us," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Vivaldi, looking round; "but be
not alarmed, Ellena, I have a ſword."</p>
            <p>"A ſword! alas! you know not—But
hark! there, again!"</p>
            <p>"That was very near us!" ſaid Vivaldi.
"This lamp burns ſo ſickly!"—and he
held it high, endeavouring to penetrate
the furtheſt gloom of the chamber. "Hah!
who goes there?" he cried, and ſtepped
ſuddenly forward; but no perſon appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and a ſilence as of the tomb, returned.</p>
            <p>"If you are in ſorrow, ſpeak!" Vivaldi,
at length, ſaid; "from fellow-ſufferers you
will meet with ſympathy. If your deſigns
are evil—tremble, for you ſhall find I am
deſperate."</p>
            <p>Still no anſwer was returned, and he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
forward the lamp to the oppoſite end
of the chamber, where he perceived a
ſmall door in the rock. At the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
he heard from within, a low tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſound, as of a perſon in prayer, or in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0247200302:36"/>
agony. He preſſed againſt. the door,
which, to his ſurprize, yielded immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and diſcovered a figure kneeling before
a crucifix, with an attention ſo wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
as not to obſerve the preſence of a
ſtranger, till Vivaldi ſpoke. The perſon
then roſe from his knees, and turning,
ſhewed the ſilvered temples and pale fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of an aged monk. The mild and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
character of the countenance, and
the lambent luſtre of eyes, which ſeemed
ſtill to retain ſomewhat of the fire of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
intereſted Vivaldi, and encouraged
Ellena, who had followed him.</p>
            <p>An unaffected ſurprize appeared in the
air of the monk; but Vivaldi, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the intereſting benignity of his
countenance, feared to anſwer his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
till the father hinted to him, that an
explanation was neceſſary, even to his own
ſafety. Encouraged by his manner, rather
than intimidated by this hint, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
that his ſituation was deſperate,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0247200302:37"/>
Vivaldi confided to the friar ſome partial
knowledge of his embarraſſment.</p>
            <p>While he ſpoke, the father liſtened with
deep attention, looked with compaſſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately
upon him and Ellena; and ſome
haraſſing objection ſeemed to contend
with the pity, which urged him to aſſiſt the
ſtrangers. He enquired how long Jeroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
had been abſent, and ſhook his head
ſignificantly when he learned that the gate
of the avenue was faſtened by a double
lock. "You are betrayed, my children,"
ſaid he, "you have truſted with the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of youth, and the cunning of age has deceived you."</p>
            <p>The terrible conviction affected Ellena
to tears; and Vivaldi, ſcarcely able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the indignation which a view of ſuch
treachery excited, was unable to offer her
any conſolation.</p>
            <p>"You, my daughter, I remember to
have ſeen in the church this morning,"
obſerved the friar; "I remember too, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0247200302:38"/>
you proteſted againſt the vows you were
brought thither to ſeal. Alas! my child,
was you aware of the conſequence of ſuch
a proceeding?"</p>
            <p>"I had only a choice of evils," Ellena
replied.</p>
            <p>"Holy father," ſaid Vivaldi, "I will
not believe, that you are one of thoſe who
either aſſiſted in or approved the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of innocence. If you were acquainted
with the misfortunes of this lady, you
would pity, and ſave her; but there is now
no time for detail; and I can only conjure
you, by every ſacred conſideration, to aſſiſt
her to leave the convent! If there were
leiſure to inform you of the unjuſtifiable
means, which have been employed to bring
her within theſe walls—if you knew that
ſhe was; taken, an orphan, from her home
at midnight—that armed ruffians brought
her hither—and at the command of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
—that ſhe has not a ſingle relation ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
to aſſert her right of independence,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0247200302:39"/>
or reclaim her of her perſecutors.—O!
holy father, if you knew all this!"—Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi
was unable to proceed.</p>
            <p>The friar again regarded Ellena with
compaſſion, but ſtill in thoughtful ſilence.
"All this may be very true," at length he
ſaid, "but"—and he heſitated.</p>
            <p>"I underſtand you, father," ſaid Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
—"you require proof; but how can
proof be adduced here? You muſt rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the honour of my word. And, if you are
inclined to aſſiſt us, it muſt be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!—while
you heſitate, we are loſt. Even
now I think I hear the footſteps of Jeronimo."</p>
            <p>He ſtepped ſoftly to the door of the
chamber, but all was yet ſtill. The friar,
too, liſtened, but he alſo deliberated;
while Ellena, with claſped hands and a look
of eager ſupplication and terror, awaited his
deciſion.</p>
            <p>"No one is approaching," ſaid Vivaldi,
"it is not yet too late!—Good father!
if you would ſerve us, diſpatch."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0247200302:40"/>
"Poor innocent!" ſaid the friar, half to
himſelf, "in this chamber—in this fatal
place!"—</p>
            <p>"It In this chamber!" exclaimed Ellena,
anticipating his meaning. "It was in this
chamber, then, that a nun was ſuffered to
periſh! and I, no doubt, am conducted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to undergo a ſimilar fate!"</p>
            <p>"In this chamber!" re-echoed Vivaldi,
in a voice of deſperation, "Holy father,
if you are indeed diſpoſed to aſſiſt us, let
us act this inſtant; the next, perhaps, may
render your beſt intentions unavailing!"</p>
            <p>The friar, who had regarded Ellena
while ſhe mentioned the nun, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſurprize, now withdrew his attention;
a few tears fell on his cheek, but he haſtily
dried them, and ſeemed ſtruggling to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſome grief, that was deep in his
heart.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, finding that entreaty had no
power to haſten his deciſion, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every moment to hear the approach of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0247200302:41"/>
Jeronimo, paced the chamber in agonizing
perturbation, now pauſing at the door to
liſten, and then calling, though almoſt
hopeleſſly, upon the humanity of the friar.
While Ellena, looking round the room in
ſhuddering horror, repeatedly exclaimed,
"On this very ſpot! in this very chamber!
O what ſufferings have theſe walls witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!
what are they yet to witneſs!"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi now endeavoured to ſoothe the
ſpirits of Ellena, and again urged the friar
to employ this critical moment in ſaving
her; "O heaven!" ſaid he, "if ſhe is now
diſcovered, her fate is certain!"</p>
            <p>"I dare not ſay what that fate would
be," interrupted the father, "or what my
own, ſhould I conſent to aſſiſt you; but,
though I am old, I have not quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
to feel for others! They may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the few remaining years of my age,
but the blooming days of youth ſhould
flouriſh; and they ſhall flouriſh, my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
if my power can aid you. Follow
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0247200302:42"/>
me to the gate; we will ſee whether my
key cannot unfaſten all the locks that hold
it."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi and Ellena immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the feeble ſteps of the old man, who
frequently ſtopped to liſten whether Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo,
or any of the brothers, to whom the
latter might have betrayed Ellena's ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were approaching; but not an echo
wandered along the lonely avenue, till they
reached the gate, when diſtant footſteps
beat upon the ground.</p>
            <p>"They are approaching, father!" whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
Ellena. "O, if the key ſhould not
open theſe locks inſtantly, we are loſt!
Hark! now I hear their voices—they call
upon my name! Already they have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
we have left the chamber."</p>
            <p>While the friar, with trembling hands,
applied the key, Vivaldi endeavoured at
once to aſſist him, and to encourage El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena.</p>
            <p>The locks gave way, and the gate opened
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0247200302:43"/>
at once upon the moonlight mountains.
Ellena heard once more, with the joy of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
the midnight breeze paſſing among
the penſile branches of the palms, that
loftily overſhadowed a rude platform be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the gate, and ruſtling with fainter
ſound among the pendent ſhrubs of the
ſurrounding cliffs.</p>
            <p>"There is no leiſure for thanks, my
children," ſaid the friar, obſerving they
were about to ſpeak. "I will fallen the
gate, and endeavour to delay your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers,
that you may have time to eſcape.
My bleſſing go with you!"</p>
            <p>Ellena and Vivaldi had ſcarcely a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to bid him "farewell!" before he
cloſed the door, and Vivaldi, taking her
arm, was haſtening towards the place
where he had ordered Paulo to wait with
the horſes, when, on turning an angle of
the convent wall, they perceived a long
train of pilgrims iſſuing forth from the
portal, at a little diſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0247200302:44"/>
Vivaldi drew back; yet dreading every
moment, that he lingered near the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
to hear the voice of Jeronimo, or
other perſons, from the avenue, he was
ſometimes inclined to proceed at any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.
The only practicable path leading
to the baſe of the mountain, however, was
now occupied by theſe devotees, and to
mingle with them was little leſs than cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
deſtruction. A bright moonlight
ſhewed diſtinctly every figure, that moved
in the ſcene, and the fugitives kept within
the ſhadow of the walls, till, warned by an
approaching footſtep, they croſſed to the
feet of the cliffs that roſe beyond ſome
palmy hillocks on the right, whoſe duſky
receſſes promiſed a temporary ſhelter.
As they paſſed with ſilent ſteps along the
winding rocks, the tranquillity of the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
below afforded an affecting contraſt
with the tumult and alarm of their minds.</p>
            <p>Being now at ſome diſtance from the
monaſtery, they reſted under the ſhade of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0247200302:45"/>
the cliffs, till the proceſſion of devotees,
which were traced deſcending among the
thickets and hollows of the mountain,
ſhould be ſufficiently remote. Often they
looked back to the convent, expecting to
ſee lights iſſue from the avenue, or the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
and attended in mute anxiety for the
ſullen murmurs of purſuit; but none
came on the breeze; nor did any gleam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lamp betray the ſteps of a ſpy.</p>
            <p>Releaſed, at length, from immediate
apprehenſion, Ellena liſtened to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin-hymn
of the pilgrims, as it came upon
the ſtill air and aſcended towards the
cloudleſs heavens. Not a ſound mingled
with the holy ſtrain, and even in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
pauſe of voices only the trembling of
the foliage above was diſtinguiſhed. The
reſponſes, as they ſoftened away in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and ſwelled again on the wafting
breeze, appeared like the muſic of ſpirits,
watching by night upon the ſummits of
the mountains, and anſwering each other
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0247200302:46"/>
in celeſtial airs, as they walk their high
boundary, and overlook the ſleeping
world.</p>
            <p>"How often, Ellena, at this hour,"
ſaid Vivaldi, "have I lingered round your
dwelling, conſoled by the conſciouſneſs of
being near you! Within thoſe walls, I
have ſaid, ſhe repoſes; they encloſe my
worlds, all without is to me a deſart. Now,
I am in your preſence! O Ellena! now
that you are once more reſtored to me, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not the caprice of poſſibility again to
ſeparate us! Let me lead you to the firſt
altar that will confirm our vows."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi forgot, in the anxiety of a
ſtronger intereſt, the delicate ſilence he
had reſolved to impoſe upon himſelf, till
Ellena ſhould be in a place of ſafety.</p>
            <p>"This is not a moment," ſhe replied,
with heſitation, "for converſation; our
ſituation is yet perilous, we tremble on the
very brink pf danger."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0247200302:47"/>
Vivaldi immediately roſe; "Into what
imminent danger," ſaid he, "had my ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
folly nearly precipitated you! We are
lingering in this alarming neighbourhood,
when that feeble ſtrain indicates the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
to be ſufficiently remote to permit
us to proceed!"</p>
            <p>As he ſpoke, they deſcended cautiouſly
among the cliffs, often looking back to
the convent, where, however, no light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
except what the moon ſhed over
the ſpires and tall windows of its cathedral.
For a moment, Ellena fancied ſhe ſaw a
taper in her favourite turret, and a belief,
that the nuns, perhaps the Abbeſs herſelf,
were ſearching for her there, renewed her
terror and her ſpeed. But the rays were
only thoſe of the moon, ſtriking through
oppoſite caſements of the chamber; and the
fugitives reached the baſe of the mountain
without further alarm, where Paulo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
with horſes, "Ah! Signormio," ſaid
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0247200302:48"/>
the ſervant, "I am glad to ſee you alive
and merry; I began to fear, by the length
of your ſtay, that, the monks had clapped
you up to do penance for life. How glad
I am to ſee you Maéſtro!"</p>
            <p>"Not more ſo than I am to ſee you,
good Paulo. But where is the pilgrim's
cloak I bade you provide?"</p>
            <p>Paulo diſplayed it, and Vivaldi, having
wrapt it round Ellena, and placed her on
horſeback, they took the read towards
Naples, Ellena deſigning to take refuge in
the convent della Pieta. Vivaldi, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
apprehending that their enemies
would ſeek them on this road, propoſed
leaving it as ſoon as practicable, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the neighbourhood of Villa Altieri by
a circuitous way.</p>
            <p>They ſoon after arrived at the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
paſs, through which Ellena had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
the monaſtery, and whoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
were considerably heightened at this
duſky hour, for the moonlight fell only
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0247200302:49"/>
partially upon the deep barriers of the
gorge, and frequently the precipice, with
the road on its brow, was entirely ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by other cliffs and woody points that
roſe above it. But Paulo, whoſe ſpirits
ſeldom owned the influence of local
ſcenery, jogged merrily along, frequently
congratulating himſelf and his maſter on
their eſcape, and carolling briſkly to the
echoes of the rocks, till Vivaldi, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
for the consequence of this loud
gaiety, deſired him to deſiſt.</p>
            <p>"Ah Signormio! I muſt obey you," ſaid
he, "but my heart was never ſo full in my
life; and I would fain ſing, to unburden
it of ſome of this joy. That ſcrape we got
into in the dungeon there, at what's the
name of the place? was bad enough, but it
was nothing to this, becauſe here I was left
out of it; and you, <hi>Maeſtro,</hi> might have
been murdered again and again, while I,
thinking of nothing at all, was quietly air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
myſelf on the mountain by moonlight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0247200302:50"/>
But what is that yonder in the ſky, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor?
It looks for all the world like a
bridge; only it is perched ſo high, that
nobody would think of building one in
ſuch an out-of-the-way place, unleſs to croſs
from cloud to cloud, much leſs would
take the trouble of clambering up after it,
for the pleaſure of going over.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi looked forward, and Ellena per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Alpine bridge, ſhe had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
croſſed with ſo much alarm, in the
moonlight perſpective, airily ſuſpended
between tremendous cliffs, with the river
far below, tumbling down the rocky
chaſm. One of the ſupporting cliffs, with
part of the bridge, was in deep ſhade, but
the other, feathered with foliage, and the
riſing ſurges at its foot, were ſtrongly illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
and many a thicket wet with the
ſpray, ſparkled in contraſt to the dark
rock it overhung. Beyond the arch, the
long-drawn proſpect faded into miſty
light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0247200302:51"/>
"Well, to be ſure!" exclaimed Paulo,
"to ſee what curioſity will do! If there
are not ſome people have found their way
up to the bridge already."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi now perceived figures upon the
ſlender arch, and, as their indiſtinct forms
glided in the moonſhine, other emotions
than thoſe of wonder diſturbed him, leſt
theſe might be pilgrims going to the ſhrine
of our Lady, and who would give infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his route. No poſſibility, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
appeared of avoiding them, for the
precipices that roſe immediately above,
and fell below, forbade all excurſion, and
the road itſelf was ſo narrow, as ſcarcely to
admit of two horſes paſſing each other.</p>
            <p>"They are all off the bridge now, and
without having broken their necks, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps!"
ſaid Paulo, "where, I wonder,
will they go next! Why ſurely, Signor,
this road does not lead to the bridge
yonder; we are not going to pick our way
in the air too? The roar of thoſe waters
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0247200302:52"/>
has made my head dizzy already; and the
rocks here are as dark as midnight, and
ſeem ready to tumble upon one; they are
enough to make one deſpair to look at
them; you need not have checked my
mirth, Signor."</p>
            <p>"I would fain check your loquacity,"
replied Vivaldi. "Do, good Paulo, be
ſilent and circumſpect, thoſe people may
be near us, though we do not yet ſee
them."</p>
            <p>"The road does lead to the bridge,
then Signor!" ſaid Paulo dolourouſly.
"And ſee! there they are again; winding
round that rock, and coming towards us."</p>
            <p>"Huſh! they are pilgrims," whiſpered
Vivaldi, "we will linger under the ſhade
of theſe rocks, while they paſs. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Paulo, that a ſingle indiſcreet word
may be fatal; and that if they hail us, I
alone am to anſwer."</p>
            <p>"You are obeyed, Signor."</p>
            <p>The fugitives drew up cloſe under the
cliffs, and proceeded ſlowly, while the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0247200302:53"/>
words of the devotees, as they advanced,
became audible.</p>
            <p>"It gives one ſome comfort," ſaid Paulo,
to hear cheerful voices, in ſuch a place as
this. Bleſs their merry hearts! theirs
ſeems a pilgrimage of pleaſure; but they
will be demure enough, I warrant, by
and bye. I wiſh I"—</p>
            <p>"Paulo! have you ſo ſoon forgot?"
ſaid Vivaldi ſharply.</p>
            <p>The devotees, on perceiving the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
became ſuddenly ſilent; till he
who appeared to be the <hi>Father-director,</hi> as
they paſſed, ſaid "Hail! in the name of
<hi>Our Lady of Mount Carmel!</hi>" and they
repeated the ſalutation in chorus.</p>
            <p>"Hail!" replied Vivaldi, "the firſt
maſs is over," and he paſſed on.</p>
            <p>"But if you make haſte, you may come
in for the ſecond," ſaid Paulo, jogging
after.</p>
            <p>"You have juſt left the ſhrine, then?"
ſaid one of the party, "and can tell us"—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0247200302:54"/>
"Poor pilgrims, like yourſelves," replied
Paulo, "and can tell as little. Good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
fathers, yonder peeps the dawn!"</p>
            <p>He came up with his maſter, who had
hurried forward with Ellena, and who now
ſeverely reproved his indiſcretion; while
the voices of the Carmelites, ſinging the
mattin-hymn, ſunk away among the rocks,
and the quietneſs of ſolitude returned.</p>
            <p>"Thank heaven! we are quit of this
adventure," ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
            <p>"And now we have only the bridge to
get over," rejoined Paulo, "and, I hope, we ſhall all be ſafe."</p>
            <p>They were now at the entrance of it;
as they paſſed the trembling planks, and
looked up the glen, a party of people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
advancing on the road the fugitives
had left, and a chorus of other voices than
thoſe of the Carmelites, were heard ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the hollow ſound of the waters.</p>
            <p>Ellena, again alarmed, haſtened for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and Vivaldi, though he endeavoured
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0247200302:55"/>
to appeaſe her apprehenſion of purſuit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
her ſpeed.</p>
            <p>"Theſe are nothing but more pilgrims
Signora," ſaid Paulo, "or they would
not ſend ſuch loud ſhouts before them;
they muſt needs think we can hear."</p>
            <p>The travellers proceeded as faſt as the
broken road would permit; and were ſoon
beyond the reach of the voices; but as
Paulo turned to look whether the party
was within ſight, he perceived two perſons,
wrapt in cloaks, advancing under the
brow of the cliffs, and within a few paces
of his horſe's heels. Before he could give
notice to his maſter, they were at his ſide.</p>
            <p>"Are you returning from the ſhrine of
<hi>our Lady?</hi>" ſaid one of them.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, ſtartled by the voice, looked
round, and demanded who aſked the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>"A brother pilgrim," replied the man,
"one who has toiled up theſe ſteep rocks,
till his limbs will ſcarcely bear him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0247200302:56"/>
Would that you would take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on him, and give him a ride."</p>
            <p>However compaſſionate Vivaldi might
be to the ſufferings of others, this was not
a moment when he could indulge his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
without endangering the ſafety
of Ellena; and he even fancied the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſpoke in a voice of diſſimulation. His
ſuſpicions ſtrengthened when the traveller,
not repulſed by a refuſal, enquired the way
he was going, and propoſed to join his
party; "For theſe mountains, they ſay,
are infeſted with banditti," he added,
"and a large company is leſs likely to be
attacked than a ſmall one."</p>
            <p>"If you are ſo very weary, my friend,"
ſaid Vivaldi, "how is it poſſible you can
keep pace with our horſes?" though I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
you have done wonders in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
them."</p>
            <p>"The fear of theſe banditti," replied
the ſtranger, "urged us on."</p>
            <p>"You have nothing to apprehend from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0247200302:57"/>
robbers," ſaid Vivaldi, "if you will only
moderate your pace; for a large company
of pilgrims are on the road, who will ſoon
overtake you."</p>
            <p>He then put an end to the converſation,
by clapping ſpurs to his horſe, and the
ſtrangers were ſoon left far behind. The
inconſiſtency of their complaints with their
ability, and the whole of their manner,
were ſerious ſubjects of alarm to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives;
but when they had loſt ſight of
them, they loſt alſo their apprehenſions;
and having, at length, emerged from the
paſs, they quitted the high road to Naples,
and ſtruck into a ſolitary one that led
weſtward towards Aquila.</p>

            <p>FROM the ſummit of a mountain, the
morning light ſhewed the travellers the
diſtant lake of Celano, gleaming at the
feet of other lofty mountains of the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,
far in the ſouth. Thither Vivaldi
judged it prudent to direct his courſe, for
the lake lay ſo remote from the immediate
way to Naples, and from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of San Stefano, that it's, banks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
a ſecure retreat. He conſidered,
alſo, that among the convents ſcattered
along thoſe delightful banks, might eaſily
be found a prieſt, who would ſolemnize
their nuptials, ſhould Ellena conſent to
an immediate marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0247200302:59"/>
The travellers deſcended among olive
woods, and ſoon after were directed by
ſome peaſants at work, into a road that
leads from Aquila to the town of Celano,
one of the very few roads which intrudes
among the wild mountains, that on every
ſide ſequeſter the lake. As they approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the low grounds, the ſcent of orange
bloſſoms breathed upon the morning air,
and the ſpicy myrtle ſent forth all its fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance
from among the cliffs, which it
thickly tufted. Bowers of lemon and
orange ſpread along the valley; and among
the cabins of the peaſants, who cultivated
them, Vivaldi hoped to obtain repoſe and
refreſhment for Ellena.</p>
            <p>The cottages, however, at which Paulo
enquired were unoccupied, the owners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all gone forth to their labour: and
the travellers, again aſcending, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſoon after among mountains inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by the flocks, where the ſcent of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0247200302:60"/>
orange was exchanged for the aromatic
perfume of the paſturage.</p>
            <p>"My Signor!" ſaid Paulo, "is not that
a ſhepherd's horn ſounding at a diſtance?
If ſo, the Signora may yet obtain ſome
refreſhment."</p>
            <p>While Vivaldi liſtened, a hautboy and a
paſtoral drum were heard considerably
nearer.</p>
            <p>They followed the ſound over the turf,
and came within view of a cabin, ſheltered
from the ſun by a tuft of almond trees.
It was a dairy-cabin belonging to ſome
ſhepherds, who at a ſhort diſtance were
watching their flocks, and, ſtretched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the ſhade of cheſtnuts, were amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves by playing upon theſe rural
inſtruments; a ſcene of Arcadian manners
frequent at this day, upon the mountains
of Abruzzo. The ſimplicity of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
approaching to wildneſs, was
tempered by a hoſpitable ſpirit. A vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
man, the chief ſhepherd, advanced
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0247200302:61"/>
to meet the ſtrangers; and, learning their
wants, conducted them into his cool cabin,
where cream, cheeſe made of goat's milk,
honey extracted from the delicious herbage
of the mountains, and dried figs were
quickly placed before them.</p>
            <p>Ellena, overcome with the fatigue of
anxiety, rather than that of travelling, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
when ſhe had taken breakfaſt, for an
hour's repoſe; while Vivaldi reſted on the
bench before the cottage, and Paulo, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
watch, diſcuſſed his breakfaſt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the circumſtances of the late
alarm, under the ſhade of the almond trees.</p>
            <p>When Ellena again appeared, Vivaldi
propoſed, that they ſhould reſt here dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the intenſe heat of the day; and, ſince
he now conſidered her to be in a place of
temporary ſafety, he ventured to renew the
ſubject neareſt his heart; to repreſent the
evils, that might overtake them, and to
urge an immediate ſolemnization of their
marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0247200302:62"/>
Thoughtful and dejected, Ellena at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for ſome time in ſilence to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and pleadings of Vivaldi. She ſecretly acknowledged the juſtneſs of his
repreſentations, but ſhe ſhrunk, more than
ever; from the indelicacy, the degradation
of intruding herſelf into his family; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
too, from whom ſhe had not only
received proofs of ſtrong diſlike, but had
ſuffered terrible injuſtice, and been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced
with ſtill ſeverer cruelty. Theſe
latter circumſtances, however, releaſed her
from all obligations of delicacy or genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
ſo far as concerned only the authors
of her ſuffering; and ſhe had now but to
conſider the happineſs of Vivaldi and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Yet ſhe could not decide thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately
on a ſubject, which ſo ſolemnly
involved the fortune of her whole life; nor
forbear reminding Vivaldi, affectionately,
gratefully, as ſhe loved him, of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
which with-held her deciſion.</p>
            <p>"Tell me yourſelf," ſaid ſhe, "whether
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0247200302:63"/>
I ought to give my hand, while your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
—your mother"—She pauſed, and
bluſhed, and burſt into tears.</p>
            <p>"Spare me the view of thoſe tears,"
ſaid Vivaldi, "and a recollection of the
circumſtances that excite them. O, let
me not think of my mother, while I ſee
you weep! Let me not remember, that
her injuſtice and cruelty deſtined you to
perpetual ſorrow!"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi's features became ſlightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed,
while he ſpoke; he roſe, paced the
room with quick ſteps, and then quitted
it, and walked under the ſhade of the
trees in front of the cabin.</p>
            <p>In a few moments, however, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his emotion and returned. Again
he placed himſelf on the bench beſide
Ellena, and taking her hand, ſaid ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in a voice of extreme ſenſibility,
"Ellena, you have long witneſſed how
dear you are to me; you cannot doubt
my love; you have long ſince promiſed—
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0247200302:64"/>
ſolemnly promiſed, in the preſence of her
who is now no more, but whoſe ſpirit may
even at this moment look down upon us,
—of her, who bequeathed you to my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt
care, to be mine for ever. By theſe
ſacred truths, by theſe affecting recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions!
I conjure you, abandon me not to
deſpair, nor in the energy of a juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſacrifice the ſon to the cruel and
miſtaken policy of the mother! You, nor
I, can conjecture the machinations, which
may be ſpread for us, when it ſhall be
known that you have left San Stefano.
If we delay to exchange our vows, I know,
and I feel—that you are loſt to me for
ever!"</p>
            <p>Ellena was affected, and for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unable to reply. At length, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her tears, ſhe ſaid tenderly, "Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can have no influence on my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
towards you; I think I feel none
towards the Marcheſa—for ſhe is your
mother. But pride, inſulted pride, has a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0247200302:65"/>
right to dictate, and ought to be obeyed;
and the time is now, perhaps, arrived when,
if I would reſpect myſelf, I muſt renounce
you."—</p>
            <p>"Renounce me!" interrupted Vivaldi,
"renounce me! And is it, then, poſſible
you could renounce me?" he repeated,
his eyes ſtill fixed upon her face with ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs
and conſternation. "Tell me at
once, Ellena, is it poſſible?"</p>
            <p>"I fear it is not," ſhe replied.</p>
            <p>"You fear! alas! if you <hi>fear,</hi> it is too
poſſible, and I have loſt you already! Say,
O! ſay but, that you <hi>hope</hi> it is not, and I,
too, will hope again."</p>
            <p>The anguiſh, with which he uttered this,
awakened all her tenderneſs, and, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the reſerve ſhe had impoſed upon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and every half-formed reſolution; ſhe
ſaid, with a ſmile of ineffable ſweetneſs, "I
will neither fear nor hope in this inſtance;
I will obey the dictates of gratitude, of
affection, and will <hi>believe.</hi> that I never
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0247200302:66"/>
can renounce you, while you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed."</p>
            <p>"Believe!" repeated Vivaldi, "only
believe! And why that mention of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
and why that unneceſſary reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Yet even this aſſurance, feebly as it
ſuſtains my hopes, is extorted; you ſee
my miſery, and from pity, from <hi>gratitude,</hi>
not affection, would aſſuage it. Beſides,
you will neither fear, nor hope! Ah, Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na!
did love ever yet exiſt without fear—and
without hope? O! never, never! I
fear and hope with ſuch rapid tranſition;
every aſſurance, every look of yours gives
ſuch force either to the one, or to the
other, that I ſuffer unceaſing anxiety.
Why, too, that cold, that heart-breaking
mention of gratitude? No, Ellena! it is
too certain that you do not love me!—My
mother's cruelty has eſtranged your heart
from me!"</p>
            <p>"How much you miſtake!" ſaid Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.
"You have already received ſacred
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0247200302:67"/>
teſtimonies of my regard; if you doubt
their ſincerity, pardon me, if I ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
myſelf as to forbear entreating you
will believe them."</p>
            <p>"How calm, how indifferent, how cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect,
how prudent!" exclaimed Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi
in tones of mournful reproach.
"But I will not diſtreſs you; forgive me
for renewing this ſubject at this time. It
was my intention to be ſilent till you ſhould
have reached a place of more permanent
ſecurity than this; but how was it poſſible,
with ſuch anxiety preſſing upon my heart,
to perſevere in that deſign. And what have
I gained by departing from it?—increaſe
of anxiety—of doubt—of fear!"</p>
            <p>"Why will you perſiſt in ſuch ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions?"
ſaid Ellena. "I cannot endure
that you ſhould doubt my affection, even
for a moment. And how can you ſuppoſe
it poſſible, that I ever can become inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of your's; that I can ever forget the
imminent danger you have voluntarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0247200302:68"/>
for my releaſe, or, remembering it,
can ceaſe to feel the warmeſt gratitude?"</p>
            <p>"That is the very word which tortures
me beyond all others!" ſaid Vivaldi; "is
it then, only a ſenſe of obligation you own
for me? O! rather ſay you hate me, than
ſuffer me to deceive my hopes with aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of a ſentiment ſo cold, ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
ſo dutiful as that of gratitude!"</p>
            <p>"With me the word has a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
acceptation," replied Ellena ſmiling.
"I underſtand it to imply all that is tender
and generous in affection; and the ſenſe
of duty which you ſay it includes, is one of
the ſweeteſt and moſt ſacred feelings of the
human heart."</p>
            <p>"Ah Ellena! I am too willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
to examine your definition rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly;
yet I believe it is your ſmile, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the accuracy of your explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that perſuades me to a confidence in
your affection; and I will truſt, that the
gratitude <hi>you</hi> feel is thus tender and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0247200302:69"/>
But, I beſeech you, name
the word no more! Its ſound is like the
touch of the Torpedo, I perceive my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
chilled even while I liſten to my
own pronunciation of it."</p>
            <p>The entrance of Paulo interrupted the
converſation, who advancing with an
air of myſtery and alarm, ſaid in a low
voice,</p>
            <p>"Signor! as I kept watch under the
almond trees, who ſhould I ſee mounting
up the road from the valley yonder, but
the two bare-footed Carmelites, that over took
us in the paſs of Chiari! I loſt them
again behind the woods, but I dare ſay
they are coming this way, for the moment
they ſpy out this dairy-hut, they will gueſs
ſomething good is to be had here; and the
ſhepherds would believe their flocks would
all die, if"—</p>
            <p>"I ſee them at this moment emerging
from the woods," ſaid Vivaldi, "and now,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0247200302:70"/>
they are leaving the road and croſſing this
way. Where is our hoſt, Paulo!</p>
            <p>"He is without, at a little diſtance,
Signor. Shall I call him?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," replied Vivaldi, "or, ſtay; I
will call him myſelf. Yet, if they ſee
me"—</p>
            <p>"Aye, Signor; or, for that matter, if
they ſee me. But we cannot help our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
now; for if we call the hoſt, we
ſhall betray ourſelves, and, if we do not
call him, he will betray us; ſo they muſt
find us out, be it as it may."</p>
            <p>"Peace! peace! let me think a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,"
ſaid Vivaldi. While Vivaldi un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to think, Paulo was peeping
about for a hiding place, if occaſion ſhould
require one.</p>
            <p>"Call our hoſt immediately," ſaid
Vivaldi, "I muſt ſpeak with him."</p>
            <p>"He paſſes the lattice at this inſtant,"
ſaid Ellena.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0247200302:71"/>
Paulo obeyed, and the ſhepherd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the cabin.</p>
            <p>"My good friend," ſaid Vivaldi, "I
muſt entreat that you will not admit thoſe
friars, whom you ſee coming this way, nor
ſuffer them to know what gueſts you have.
They have been very troubleſome to us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
on the road; I will reward you for
any loſs their ſudden departure may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
you."</p>
            <p>"Nay for that matter, friend," ſaid
Paulo, "it is their viſit only that can occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
you loſs, begging the Signor's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
their departure never occaſioned
loſs to any body. And to tell you the
truth, for my maſter will not ſpeak out,
we were obliged to look pretty ſharply
about us, while they bore us company, or
we have reaſon to think our pockets would
have been the lighter. They are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people, friend, take my word for it;
banditti, perhaps, in diſguiſe. The dreſs
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0247200302:72"/>
of a Carmelite would ſuit their purpoſe, at
this time of the pilgrimage. So be pretty
blunt with them, if they want to come in
here; and you will do well, when they go,
to ſend ſomebody to watch which way
they take, and ſee them clear off, or you
may loſe a ſtray lamb, perhaps."</p>
            <p>The old ſhepherd lifted up his eyes and
hands, "To ſee how the world goes!" ſaid
he. "But thank you, Maeſtro, for your
warning; they ſhall not come within my
threſhold, for all their holy ſeeming, and
its the firſt time in my life I ever ſaid nay
to one of their garb, and mine has been a
pretty long one, as you may gueſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
by my face. How old, Signor,
ſhould you take me to be? I warrant you
will gueſs ſhort of the matter tho'; for on
theſe high mountains"—</p>
            <p>"I will gueſs when you have diſmiſſed
the travellers," ſaid Vivaldi, "after having
given them ſome haſty refreſhment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0247200302:73"/>
they muſt be almoſt at the door, by
this time. Diſpatch, friend."</p>
            <p>"If they ſhould fall foul upon me, for
refuſing them entrance," ſaid the ſhepherd,
"you will come out to help me, Signor?
for my lads are at ſome diſtance."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi aſſured him that they would,
and he left the cabin.</p>
            <p>Paulo ventured to peep at the lattice, on
what might be going forward without.
"They are gone round to the door, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
I fancy," ſaid he, "for I ſee nothing
of them this way; if there was but another
window What fooliſh people to build a
cottage with no window. near the door!
But I muſt liſten."</p>
            <p>He ſtepped on tip-toe to the door, and
bent his head in attention.</p>
            <p>"They are certainly ſpies from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,"
ſaid Ellena to Vivaldi, "they fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llow
us ſo cloſely! If they were pilgrims, it
is improbable, too, that their way ſhould
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0247200302:74"/>
be through this unfrequented region, and
ſtill more ſo, that they ſhould not travel in
a larger party. When my abſence was
diſcovered, theſe people were ſent, no
doubt, in purſuit of me, and having met
the devotees whom we paſſed, they were
enabled to follow our route."</p>
            <p>"We ſhall do well to act upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,"
replied Vivaldi, "but, though
I am inclined to believe them emiſſaries
from San Stefano, it is not improbable
that they are only Carmelites returning to
ſome convent on the lake of Celano."</p>
            <p>"I cannot hear a ſyllable, Signor," ſaid
Paulo. "Pray do liſten yourſelf! and
there is not a ſingle chink in this door to
afford one conſolation. Well! if ever I
build a cottage, there ſhall be a window
near—"</p>
            <p>"Liſten!" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
            <p>"Not a ſingle word, Signor!" cried
Paulo, after a pauſe, "I do not even hear
a voice!—But now I hear ſteps, and they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0247200302:75"/>
are coming to the door, too; they ſhall
find it no eaſy matter to open it, though;"
he added, placing himſelf againſt it. "Ay,
ay, you may knock, friend, till your
arm aches, and kick and lay about you—no
matter for that."</p>
            <p>"Silence! let us know who it is," ſaid
Vivaldi; and the old ſhepherd's voice
was heard without. "They are gone,
Signors," ſaid he, "you may open the
door."</p>
            <p>"Which way did they go?" aſked Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi,
when the man entered. "I cannot
ſay, as to that, Signor, becauſe I did not
happen to ſee them at all; and I have been
looking all about, too."</p>
            <p>"Why, I ſaw them myſelf, croſſing
this way from the wood yonder," ſaid
Paulo.</p>
            <p>"And there is nothing to ſhelter them
from our view between the wood, and this
cottage, friend," added Vivaldi; "What
can they have done with themſelves?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0247200302:76"/>
"For that matter, gone into the wood
again, perhaps," ſaid the ſhepherd.</p>
            <p>Paulo gave his maſter a ſignificant look,
and added, "It is likely enough, friend;
and you may depend upon it they are
lurking there for no good purpoſe, You
will do well to ſend ſomebody to look after
them; your flocks will ſuffer for it, elſe.
Depend upon it, they deſign no good."</p>
            <p>"We are not uſed to ſuch ſort of folks
in theſe parts," replied the ſhepherd,
"but if they mean any harm, they ſhall
find we can help ourſelves." As her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
he took down a horn from the
roof, and blew a ſhrill blaſt that made the
mountains echo; when immediately the
younger ſhepherds were ſeen running from
various quarters towards the cottage.</p>
            <p>"Do not be alarmed, friend;" ſaid
Vivaldi, "theſe travellers mean you no
harm, I dare ſay, whatever they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
againſt us. But, as I think them ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
perſons, and ſhould not like to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0247200302:77"/>
overtake them on the road, I will reward
one of your lads if you will let him go a
little ways towards Celano, and examine
whether they are lurking on that route."</p>
            <p>The old man conſented, and, when the
ſhepherds came up, one of them received
directions from Vivaldi.</p>
            <p>"And be ſure you do not return, till
you have found them," added Paulo.</p>
            <p>"No maſter," replied the lad, "and I
will bring them ſafe here, you may truſt
me."</p>
            <p>"If you do, friend, you will get your
head broke for your trouble. You are
only to diſcover where they are, and to
watch where they go," ſaid Paulo.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, at length, made the lad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
what was required of him, and
he departed; while the old ſhepherd went
out to keep guard.</p>
            <p>The time of his abſence was paſſed
in various conjectures by the party in the
cabin, concerning the Carmelites, Vivaldi
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0247200302:78"/>
ſtill inclined to believe they were honeſt
people returning from a pilgrimage, but
Paulo was decidedly againſt this opinion.
"They are waiting for us on the road, you
may depend upon it, Signor," ſaid the
latter. "You may be certain they have
ſome <hi>great deſign</hi> in hand, or they would
never have turned their ſteps from this
dairy-houſe when once they had ſpied it,
and that they did ſpy it, we are ſure."</p>
            <p>"But if they have in hand the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
you ſpeak of, Paulo," ſaid Vivaldi,
"it is probable that they have ſpied us
alſo, by their taking this obſcure road.
Now it muſt have occurred to them when
they ſaw a dairy-hut, in ſo ſolitary a region,
that we might probably be found within—yet
they have not examined. It appears,
therefore, they have no deſign againſt
us. What can you anſwer to this Paulo?
I truſt the apprehenſions of Signora di
Roſalba are unſounded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0247200302:79"/>
"Why! do you ſuppoſe, Signor, they
would attack us when we were ſafe
houſed, and had theſe good ſhepherds to
lend us a helping hand? No, Signor, they
would not even have shewn themſelves, if
they could have helped it; and being once
ſure we were here, they would ſkulk back
to the woods, and lurk for us in the road
they knew we muſt go, ſince, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
there is only one."</p>
            <p>"How is it poſſible," ſaid Ellena, "that
they can have diſcovered us here, ſince they
did not approach the cabin to enquire."</p>
            <p>"They came near enough for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
Signora, I dare ſay; and, if the
truth were known, they ſpied my face
looking at them through the lattice."</p>
            <p>"Come, come," ſaid Vivaldi, "you
are an ingenious tormentor, indeed, Paulo.
Do you ſuppoſe they ſaw enough of thy
face laſt night by moonlight, in that duſky
glen, to enable them to recollect it again
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0247200302:80"/>
at a diſtance of forty yards? Revive, my
Ellena, I think every appearance is in our
favour."</p>
            <p>"Would I could think, ſo too!" ſaid
ſhe, with a ſigh.</p>
            <p>"O! for that matter, Signora," rejoined
"Paulo, there is nothing to be afraid of;
they ſhould find tough work of it, if
they thought proper to attack us, lady."</p>
            <p>"It is not an open attack that we have
to fear," replied Ellena, "but they may
ſurround us with their ſnares, and defy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance."</p>
            <p>However Vivaldi might accede to the
truth of this remark, he would not appear
to do ſo; but tried to laugh away her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions;
and Paulo was ſilenced for a
while, by a ſignificant look from his
maſter.</p>
            <p>The ſhepherd's boy returned much
ſooner than they had expected, and he
probably ſaved his time, that he might
ſpare his labour, for he brought no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0247200302:81"/>
of the Carmelites. "I looked for
them among the woods along the road
ſide in the hollow, yonder, too," ſaid
the lad, "and then I mounted the hill
further on, but I could ſee nothing of
them far or near, nor of a ſingle ſoul, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
our goats, and ſome of them do ſtray
wide enough, ſometimes; they lead me a
fine dance often. They ſometimes, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
have wandered as far as Monte
Nuvola, yonder, and got to the top of it,
up among the clouds, and the crags,
where I ſhould break my neck if I climbed;
and the rogues ſeemed to know it, too,
for when they have ſeen me coming,
ſcrambling up, puffing and blowing, they
have ceaſed their capering, and ſtood peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over a crag ſo ſly, and ſo quiet, it
ſeemed as if they were laughing at me;
as much as to ſay, "Catch us if you
can."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, who during the latter part of
this ſpeech had been conſulting with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0247200302:82"/>
Ellena, whether they ſhould proceed on
their way immediately, aſked the boy ſome
further queſtions concerning the Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites;
and becoming convinced that they
had either not taken the road to Celano,
or, having taken it, were at a conſiderable
diſtance, he propoſed ſetting out, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
leiſurely, "For I have now little
apprehenſion of theſe people," he added,
"and a great deal leſt night ſhould over take
us before we reach the place of our
deſtination, ſince the road is mountainous
and wild, and, further, we are not perfectly
acquainted with it."</p>
            <p>Ellena approving the plan, they took
leave of the good ſhepherd, who could
with difficulty be prevailed with to accept
any recompence for his trouble, and who
gave them ſome further directions as to the
road; and their way was long cheered by
the ſound of the tabor and the ſweetneſs
of the hautboy, wafted over the wild.</p>
            <p>When they deſcended into the woody
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0247200302:83"/>
hollow mentioned by the boy, Ellena ſent
forth many an anxious look beneath the
deep ſhade; while Paulo, ſometimes ſilent,
and at others whiſtling and ſinging loudly,
as if to overcome his fears, peeped under
every bough that croſſed the road, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
to diſcover his friends the Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
lurking within its gloom.</p>
            <p>Having emerged from this valley, the
road lay over mountains covered with
flocks, for it was now the ſeaſon when they
had quitted the plains of Apulia, to feed
upon the herbage for which this region is
celebrated; and it was near ſun-ſet, when,
from a ſummit to which the travellers had
long been aſcending, the whole lake of
Celano, with its vaſt circle of mountains,
burſt at once upon their view.</p>
            <p>"Ah Signor!" exclaimed Paulo, "what
a proſpect is here! It reminds me of
home; it is almoſt as pleaſant as the bay
of Naples! I ſhould never love it like that
though, if it were an hundred times finer."
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0247200302:84"/>
The travellers ſtopped to admire the
ſcene, and to give their horſes reſt, after
the labour of the aſcent. The evening
ſun, ſhooting athwart a clear expanſe of
water, between eighteen and twenty leagues
in circumference, lighted up all the towns
and villages, and towered caſtles, and ſpiry
convents, that enriched the riſing ſhores;
brought out all the various tints of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and coloured with beamy purple
the mountains which on every ſide formed
the majeſtic background of the landſcape.
Vivaldi pointed out to Ellena the gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
Velino in the north, a barrier moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
between the territories of Rome and
Naples. Its peaked head towered far
above every neighbouring ſummit, and its
white precipices were oppoſed to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
points of the Majella, ſnow-crowned,
and next in altitude, loved by the flocks.
Weſtward, near woody hills, and riſing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the lake, appeared Monte
Salviano, covered with wild ſage, as its
name imports, and once pompous with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0247200302:85"/>
foreſts of cheſtnut; a branch from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennine
extended to meet it. "See," ſaid
Vivaldi "where Monte Corno ſtands like
a ruffian, huge, ſcared, threatening, and
horrid!—and in the ſouth, where the ſullen
mountain of San Nicolo ſhoots up, barren
and rocky! From thence, mark how other
overtopping ridges of the mighty Apennine
darken the horizon far along the eaſt, and
circle to approach the Velino in the north!"</p>
            <p>"Mark too," ſaid Ellena, "how ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the banks and undulating plains repoſe
at the feet of the mountains; what an
image of beauty and elegance they oppoſe
to the awful grandeur that overlooks and
guards them! Obſerve, too, how many a
delightful valley, opening from the lake,
ſpreads its rice and corn fields, ſhaded
with groves of the almond, far among the
winding hills; how gaily vineyards and
olives alternately chequer the acclivities,
and how gracefully the lofty palms bend
over the higher cliffs."</p>
            <p>"Ay, Signora!" exclaimed Paulo, "and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0247200302:86"/>
have the goodneſs to obſerve how like are
the fiſhing boats, that ſail towards the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
below, to thoſe one ſees upon the bay
of Naples. They are worth all the reſt of
the proſpect, except indeed this fine ſheet
of water, which is almoſt as good as the bay,
and that mountain, with its ſharp
head, which is almoſt as good as Veſuvius
—if it would but throw out fire!"</p>
            <p>"We muſt deſpair of finding a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in this neighbourhood, ſo <hi>good</hi> as to
do that, Paulo," ſaid Vivaldi, ſmiling at
this ſtroke of nationality; "though, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
many that we now ſee, have once
been volcanic."</p>
            <p>"I honour them for that, Signor; and
look at them with double ſatisfaction;
but <hi>our.</hi> mountain is the only mountain in
the world. O! to ſee it of a dark night!
what a blazing it makes! and what a
height it will ſhoot to! and what a light
it throws over the ſea! No other moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
can do ſo. It ſeems as if the waves
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0247200302:87"/>
were all on fire. I have ſeen the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as far off as Capri, trembling all acroſs
the gulf, and ſhewing every veſſel as plain
as at noon day; ay, and every ſailor on
the deck. You never ſaw ſuch a ſight,
Signor."</p>
            <p>"Why you do, indeed, ſeem to have
forgotten that I ever did, Paulo, and
alſo that a volcano can do any miſchief.
But let us return, Ellena, to the ſcene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. Yonder, a mile or two within
the ſhore, is the town of Celano, whither
we are going."</p>
            <p>The clearneſs of an Italian atmoſphere
permitted him to diſcriminate the minute
through very diſtant features of the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape;
and on an eminence riſing from the
plains of a valley, opening to the weſt, he
pointed out the modern Alba, crowned
with the ruins of its ancient caſtle, ſtill
viſible upon the ſplendor of the horizon,
the priſon and tomb of many a Prince,
who, "fallen from his high eſtate," was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0247200302:88"/>
ſent from Imperial Rome to finiſh here
the ſad reverſe of his days; to gaze from
the bars of his tower upon ſolitudes where
beauty or grandeur adminiſtered no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaging
feelings to him, whoſe life had
paſſed amidſt the intrigues of the world,
and the feveriſh contentions of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ambition; to him, with whom reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
brought only remorſe, and antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
deſpair; whom "no horizontal
beam enlivened in the crimſon evening of
life's duſty day."</p>
            <p>"And to ſuch a ſcene as this," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi,
"a Roman Emperor came, only for
the purpoſe of witneſſing the moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
exhibition; to indulge the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
delights! Here, Claudius celebrated
the accompliſhment of his arduous work,
an aqueduct to carry the overflowing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Celano to Rome, by a naval
fight, in which hundreds of wretched ſlaves
periſhed for his amuſement! Its pure and
poliſhed ſurface was ſtained with human
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0247200302:89"/>
blood, and roughened by the plunging bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the ſlain, while the gilded gallies
of the Emperor floated gaily around, and
theſe beautiful ſhores were made to echo
with applauding yells, worthy of the
furies!"</p>
            <p>"We ſcarcely dare to truſt the truth of
hiſtory, in ſome of its traits of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,"
ſaid Ellena.</p>
            <p>"Signor," cried Paulo, "I have been
thinking that while we are taking the air,
ſo much at our eaſe, here, thoſe Carmelites
may be ſpying at us from ſome hole or
corner that we know nothing of, and may
ſwoop upon us, all of a ſudden, before we
can help ourſelves. Had we not better go
on, Signor?"</p>
            <p>"Our horſes are, perhaps, ſufficiently
reſted," replied Vivaldi, "but, if I had not
long ſince diſmiſſed all ſuſpicion of the
evil intention of thoſe ſtrangers, I ſhould
not willingly have ſtopped for a moment."</p>
            <p>"But pray let us proceed," ſaid Ellena.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0247200302:90"/>
"Ay, Signora, it is beſt to be of the
ſafe ſide," obſerved Paulo. "Yonder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
is Celano, and I hope we ſhall get ſafe
houſed there, before it is quite dark, for
here we have no mountain, that will light
us on our way! Ah! if we were but within
twenty miles of Naples, now,—and it was
an <hi>illumination.</hi> night!"—</p>
            <p>As they deſcended the mountain, Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
ſilent and dejected, abandoned herſelf
to reflection. She was too ſenſible of the
difficulties of her preſent ſituation, and
too apprehenſive of the influence, which
her determination muſt have on all her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
life, to be happy, though eſcaped
from the priſon of San Stefano, and in the
preſence of Vivaldi, her beloved deliverer
and protector. He obſerved her dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with grief, and, not underſtanding all
the finer ſcruples that diſtreſſed her, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
her reſerve into indifference towards
himſelf. But he forbore to diſturb
her again with a mention of his doubts,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0247200302:91"/>
or fears; and he determined not to urge the
ſubject of his late entreaties, till he ſhould
have placed her in ſome ſecure aſylum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where ſhe might feel herſelf at perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to accept or to reject his propoſal.
By acting with an honour ſo delicate, he
unconſciouſly adopted a certain means of
increaſing her eſteem and gratitude, and
deſerved them the more, ſince he had to
endure the apprehenſion of loſing her by the
delay thus occaſioned to their nuptials.</p>
            <p>They reached the town of Celano be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the evening cloſed; when Vivaldi was
requeſted by Ellena to enquire for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
where ſhe might be lodged for the
night. He left her at the inn, with Paulo
for her guard, and proceeded on his ſearch.
The firſt gate he knocked upon belonged
to a convent of Carmelites. It appeared
probable, that the pilgrims of that order,
who had occaſioned him ſo much diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
were honeſt brothers of this houſe;
but as it was probable alſo, that if they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0247200302:92"/>
were emiſſaries of the Abbeſs of San Stefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,
and came to Celano, they would take
up their lodging with a ſociety of their
own claſs, in preference to that of any
other, Vivaldi thought it prudent to retire
from their gates without making himſelf
known. He paſſed on, therefore, and
ſoon after arrived at a convent of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,
where he learned, that there were
only two houſes of nuns in Celano, and
that theſe admitted no other boarders than
permanent ones.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi returned with this intelligence
to Ellena, who endeavoured to reconcile
herſelf to the neceſſity of remaining where
ſhe was; but Paulo, ever active and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
brought intelligence, that at a little
fiſhing town, at ſome diſtance, on the
bank of the lake, was a convent of Urſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
remarkable for their hoſpitality to
ſtrangers. The obſcurity of ſo remote a
place, was another reaſon for preferring it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0247200302:93"/>
to Celano, and Vivaldi propoſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
thither, if Ellena was not too weary
to proceed, ſhe readily, aſſented, and they
immediately ſet off.</p>
            <p>"It happens to be a fine night," ſaid
Paulo, as they left Celano, "and ſo, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
we cannot well loſe our way; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they ſay, there is but one. The town
we are going to lies yonder on the edge of
the lake, about a mile and a hair off. I
think I can ſee a gray ſteeple or two, a
little to the right of that wood where the
water gleams ſo."</p>
            <p>"No, Paulo," replied Vivaldi, after
looking attentively. "I perceive what
you mean; but thoſe are not the points of
ſteeples, they are only the tops of ſome
tall cypreſſes."</p>
            <p>"Pardon me, Signor, they are too ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
for trees; that muſt ſurely be the
town. This road, however, will lead us
right, for there is no other to puzzle us,
as they ſay,"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0247200302:94"/>
"This cool and balmy air revives me,"
ſaid Ellena; "and what a ſoothing ſhade
prevails over the ſcene! How ſoftened,
yet how diſtinct, is every near object;
how ſweetly dubious the more removed
ones; while the mountains beyond cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
themſelves ſublimely upon the ſtill
glowing horizon."</p>
            <p>"Obſerve, too," ſaid Vivaldi, "how
their broken ſummits, tipt with the beams
that have ſet to our lower region, exhibit
the portraiture of towers and caſtles, and
embattled ramparts, which ſeemed deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to guard them againſt the enemies,
that may come by the clouds."</p>
            <p>"Yes," replied Ellena, "the mountains
themſelves diſplay a ſublimity, that ſeems
to belong to a higher world; their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
ought not to be of this earth; they
can be only ſpirits of the air."</p>
            <p>"They can be nothing elſe, Signora,"
ſaid Paulo, "for nothing of this earth can
reach them. See! lady, they have ſome
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0247200302:95"/>
of the qualities of your ſpirits, too; ſee!
how they change their ſhapes and colours,
as the ſun-beams ſink. And now, how
gray and dim they grow! See but how
faſt they vaniſh!"</p>
            <p>"Every thing repoſes," ſaid Vivaldi."
"who would willingly travel in the day,
when Italy has ſuch nights as this!"</p>
            <p>"Signor, that <hi>is</hi> the town before us,"
ſaid Paulo, "for now I can diſcern, plain
enough, the ſpires of convents; and there
goes a light! Hah, hah! and there is a
bell, too, chiming from one of the ſpires!
The monks are going to maſs; would we
were going to ſupper, Signor!"</p>
            <p>"That chime is nearer than the place
you point to, Paulo, and I doubt whether
it comes from the ſame quarter."</p>
            <p>"Hark! Signor, the air wafts the ſound!
and now it is gone again."</p>
            <p>"Yes, I believe you are right, Paulo,
and that we have not far to go."</p>
            <p>The travellers deſcended the gradual
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0247200302:96"/>
ſlopes, towards the ſhore; and Paulo,
ſome time after, exclaimed, "See, Signor,
where another light glides along See! it
is reflected on the lake."</p>
            <p>"I hear the faint daſhing of waves,
now," ſaid Ellena, "and the ſound of
oars, too. But obſerve, Paulo, the light
is not in the town, it is in the boat that
moves yonder."</p>
            <p>"Now it retreats, and trembles in a
lengthening line upon the waters," ſaid
Vivaldi. "We have been too ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what we wiſh and have yet far to
go."</p>
            <p>The ſhore they were approaching form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſpacious bay for the lake, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
below. Dark woods ſeemed to ſpread
along the banks, and aſcend among the
cultivated ſlopes towards the mountains;
except where, here and there, cliffs, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the water, were diſtinguiſhed
through the twilight by the whiteneſs of
their limeſtone precipices. Within the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0247200302:97"/>
bay, the town became gradually viſible;
lights twinkled between the trees, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and vaniſhing; like the ſtars of a cloudy
night; and, at length was heard the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
ſong of boatmen, who were fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near the ſhore.</p>
            <p>Other ſounds ſoon after ſtruck the ear.
"O, what merry notes!" exclaimed Paulo,
"they make my heart dance. See! Sigr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora,
there is a group, footing it away ſo
gaily on the bank of the lake, yonder, by
thoſe trees. O, what a merry ſet! Would
I were among them! that is, I mean, if
you, <hi>Maeſtro,</hi> and the Signora were not
here."</p>
            <p>"Well corrected, Paulo."</p>
            <p>"It is a feſtival, I fancy," obſerved Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.
"Theſe peaſants of the lake can
make the moments fly as gaily as the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuaries
of the city, it ſeems."</p>
            <p>"O! what merry muſic!" repeated
Paulo. "Ah! how often I have footed it
as joyouſly on the beach at Naples, after
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0247200302:98"/>
ſun-ſet, of a fine night, like this; with
ſuch a pleaſant freſh breeze to cool one!
Ah! there are none like the fiſhermen of
Naples for a dance by moonlight; how
lightly they do trip it! O! if I was but
there now! That is, I mean, if you,
<hi>Maeſtro,</hi> and the Signora were there too.
O! what merry notes!"</p>
            <p>"We thank you, good Signor Paulo,"
ſaid Vivaldi, "and I truſt we ſhall all be
there ſoon; when you ſhall trip it away,
with as joyous an heart as the beſt of
them."</p>
            <p>The travellers now entered the town,
which conſiſted of one ſtreet, ſtraggling
along the margin of the lake; and having
enquired for the Urſaline convent, were
directed to it's gates. The portreſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
immediately upon-the ringing of the
bell, and carried a meſſage to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs,
who as quickly returned an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Ellena. She alighted, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the portreſs to the parlour, while
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0247200302:99"/>
Vivaldi remained at the gate, till he ſhould
know whether ſhe approved of her new
lodging. A ſecond invitation induced him,
alſo, to alight; he was admitted to the
grate, and offered refreſhment, which,
however, he declined ſtaying to accept,
as he had yet a lodging to ſeek for the
night. The Abbeſs, on learning this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
courteouſly recommended him
to a neighbouring ſociety of Benedictines,
and deſired him to mention her name to
the Abbot.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi then took leave of Ellena, and,
though it was only for a few hours, he left
her with dejection, and with ſome degree
of apprehenſion for her ſafety, which,
though circumſtances could not juſtify
him in admitting, he could not entirely
ſubdue. She ſhared his dejection, but not
his fears, when the door cloſed after him,
and ſhe found herſelf once more among
ſtrangers. The forlornneſs of her feelings
could not be entirely overcome by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0247200302:100"/>
of the Abbeſs; and there was a
degree of curioſity, and even of ſcrutiny,
expreſſed in the looks of ſome of the ſiſters,
which ſeemed more than was due to a
ſtranger. From ſuch examination ſhe
eagerly eſcaped to the apartment allotted
for her, and to the repoſe from which ſhe
had ſo long been withheld.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, meanwhile, had found an hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable
reception with the Benedictines,
whoſe ſequeſtered ſituation made the viſit
of a ſtranger a pleaſurable novelty to
them. In the eagerneſs of converſation,
and, yielding to the ſatisfaction which the
mind receives from exerciſing ideas that
have long ſlept in duſky indolence, and
to the pleaſure of admitting new ones, the
Abbot and a few of the brothers ſat with
Vivaldi to a late hour. When, at length,
the traveller was ſuffered to retire, other
ſubjects than thoſe, which had intereſted
his hoſt, engaged his thoughts; and he
revolved the means of preventing the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0247200302:101"/>
miſery that threatened him, in a ſerious
ſeparation from Ellena. Now, that ſhe
was received into a reſpectable aſylum,
every motive for ſilence upon this topic
was done away. He determined, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that on the following morning, he
would urge all his reaſons and entreaties
for an immediate marriage; and among
the brothers of the Benedictine, he had

            <p>WHILE Vivaldi and Ellena were on
the way from San Stefano, the Marcheſe
Vivaldi was ſuffering the utmoſt vexation,
reſpecting his ſon; and the Marcheſa felt
not leſs apprehenſion, that the abode of
Ellena might be diſcovered; yet this
fear did not withhold her from mingling
in all the gaieties of Naples. Her aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
were, as uſual, among the moſt
brilliant of that voluptuous city, and ſhe
patronized, as zealouſly as before, the
ſtrains of her favourite compoſer. But,
notwithſtanding this perpetual diſſipation,
her thoughts frequently withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0247200302:103"/>
from the ſcene, and dwelt on gloomy
forebodings of diſappointed pride.</p>
            <p>A circumſtance, which rendered her
particularly ſuſceptible to ſuch diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at this time, was, that overtures of
alliance had been lately made to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe,
by the father of a lady, who was held
ſuitable, in every conſideration, to become
his daughter; and whoſe wealth rendered
the union particularly deſirable at a time,
when the expences of ſuch an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as was neceſſary to the vanity of the
Marcheſa, conſiderably exceeded his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
large as it was.</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa's temper had been thus
irritated by the contemplation of her ſon's
conduct in an affair, which ſo materially
affected the fortune, and, as ſhe believed,
the honour of his family; when a courier
from the Abbeſs of San Stefano brought
intelligence of the flight of Ellena with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.
She was in a diſpoſition, which
heightened diſappointment into fury; and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0247200302:104"/>
ſhe forfeited, by the tranſports to which
ſhe yielded, the degree of pity that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
was due to a mother, who believed
her only ſon to have ſacrificed his family and
himſelf to an unworthy paſſion. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that he was now married, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
loſt. Scarcely able to endure
the agony of this conviction, ſhe ſent for
her ancient adviſer Schedoni, that ſhe
might, at leaſt, have the relief of expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her emotions; and of examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there remained a poſſibility of diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe long-dreaded nuptials. The
phrenzy of paſſion, however, did not ſo far
overcome her circumſpection as to compel
her to acquaint the Marcheſe with the
contents of the Abbeſs's letter, before ſhe
had conſulted with her Confeſſor. She
knew that the principles of her huſband
were too juſt, upon the grand points of
morality, to ſuffer him to adopt the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
ſhe might judge neceſſary; and ſhe
avoided informing him of the marriage of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0247200302:105"/>
his ſon, until the means of counteracting
it ſhould have been ſuggeſted and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
however deſperate ſuch means
might be.</p>
            <p>Schedoni was not to be found. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
circumſtances encreaſe the irritation
of a mind in ſuch a ſtate as was her's.
The delay of an opportunity for unbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
her heart to Schedoni, was hardly
to be endured; another and another
meſſenger were diſpatched to her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</p>
            <p>"My miſtreſs has committed ſome
great ſin, truely!" ſaid the ſervant, who
had been twice to the convent, within the
laſt half hour. "It muſt lie heavy on
her conſcience, in good truth, ſince ſhe
cannot ſupport it for one half hour. Well!
the rich have this comfort, however, that,
let them be ever ſo guilty, they can buy
themſelves innocent again, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a ducat. Now a poor man might
be a month before he recovered his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0247200302:106"/>
and that, too, not till after many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
of hard flogging.".</p>
            <p>In the evening Schedoni came, but it
was only to confirm her worſt fear. He,
too, had heard of the eſcape of Ellena, as
well as that ſhe was on the lake of Celano,
and was married to Vivaldi. How he had
obtained this information he did not chuſe
to diſcloſe, but he mentioned ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
circumſtances in confirmation of it's
truth, and appeared to be ſo perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the facts he related, that the
Marcheſa believed them, as implicitly as
himſelf; and her paſſion and deſpair tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
all bounds of decorum;</p>
            <p>Schedoni obſerved, with dark and ſilent
pleaſure, the turbulent exceſs of her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
and perceived that the moment was
now arrived, when he might command
them to his purpoſe, ſo as to render his
aſſiſtance indiſpenſable to her repoſe; and
probably ſo as to accompliſh the revenge
he had long meditated againſt Vivaldi,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0247200302:107"/>
without hazarding the favour of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa.
So far was he from attempting to
ſooth her ſufferings, that he continued to
irritate her reſentment, and exaſperate her
pride; effecting this, at the ſame time,
with ſuch imperceptible art, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
only to be palliating the conduct of
Vivaldi, and endeavouring to conſole his
diſtracted mother.</p>
            <p>"This is a raſh ſtep, certainly," ſaid
the Confeſſor;" but he is young, very
young, and, therefore, does not foreſee the
conſequence to which it leads. He does
not perceive how ſeriouſly it will affect the
dignity of his houſe;—how much it will
depreciate his conſequence with the court,
with the nobles of his own rank, and even
with the plebeians, with whom he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
to connect himſelf. Intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with the paſſions of youth, he does
not weigh the value of thoſe bleſſings,
which wiſdom and the experience of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer
age know how to eſtimate. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0247200302:108"/>
them <hi>only</hi> becauſe he does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their influence in ſociety, and that
lightly to reſign them, is to degrade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the view of almoſt every mind.
Unhappy young man! he is to be pitied
fully as much as blamed."</p>
            <p>"Your excuſes, reverend father," ſaid
the tortured Marcheſa, "prove the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of your heart; but they illuſtrate,
alſo, the degeneracy of his mind, and detail
the full extent of the effects which he has
brought upon his family. It affords me
no conſolation to know, that this degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
proceeds from his head, rather than
his heart; it is ſufficient that he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
it, and that no poſſibility remains
of throwing off the misfortune."
"Perhaps that is affirming too much,"
obſerved Schedoni.</p>
            <p>"How, father!" ſaid the Marcheſa.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps a poſſibility does remain,"
ſaid he.</p>
            <p>"Point it out to me, good father! I
do not perceive it."
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0247200302:109"/>
"Nay, my lady," replied the ſubtle
Schedoni, correcting himſelf, "I am by no
means aſſured, that ſuch poſſibility does
exiſt. My ſolicitude for your tranquillity,
and for the honour of your houſe, makes
me ſo unwilling to relinquiſh hope, that,
perhaps, I only imagine a poſſibility in your
favour. Let me conſider.—Alas! the
misfortune, ſevere as it is, muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured;
—there remain no means of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it."</p>
            <p>"It was cruel of you, father, to ſuggeſt
a hope which you could not juſtify," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the Marcheſa.</p>
            <p>"You muſt excuſe my extreme ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
then," replied the Confeſſor. "But
how is it poſſible for me to fee a family of
your ancient eſtimation brought into ſuch
circumſtances; its honours blighted by
the folly of a thoughtleſs boy, without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſorrow and indignation, and looking
round for even ſome deſperate means of
delivering it from diſgrace." He pauſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0247200302:110"/>
"Diſgrace!" exclaimed the Marcheſa;
"father, you—you—Diſgrace!—The
word is a ſtrong one, but—it is, alas!
juſt. And ſhall we ſubmit to this?—Is
it poſſible we <hi>can</hi> ſubmit to it?"</p>
            <p>"There is no remedy," ſaid Schedoni,
coolly.</p>
            <p>"Good God!" exclaimed the Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,
"that there ſhould be no law to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
or, at leaſt, to puniſh ſuch criminal
marriages!"</p>
            <p>"It is much to be lamented," replied
Schedoni.</p>
            <p>"The woman who obtrudes herſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a family, to diſhonour it," continued
the Marcheſa, "deſerves a puniſhment
nearly equal to that of a ſtate criminal,
ſince ſhe injures thoſe who beſt ſupport
the ſtate. She ought to ſuffer"—</p>
            <p>"Not nearly, but quite equal, "inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Confeſſor, "ſhe deſerves—death!"</p>
            <p>He pauſed, and there was a moment
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0247200302:111"/>
of profound ſilence, till he added—"for
death only can obliviate the degradation
ſhe has occaſioned; her death alone can
reſtore the original ſplendor of the line ſhe
would have ſullied."</p>
            <p>He pauſed again, but the Marcheſa ſtill
remaining ſilent, he added, "I have often
marvelled that our lawgivers ſhould have
failed to perceive the juſtneſs, nay the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
of ſuch puniſhment!"</p>
            <p>"It is aſtoniſhing," ſaid the Marcheſa,
thoughtfully, "that a regard for their own
honour did not ſuggeſt it."</p>
            <p>"Juſtice does not the leſs exiſt, becauſe
her laws are neglected," obſerved Schedoni.
A ſenſe of what ſhe commands lives in our
breaſts; and when we fail to obey that ſenſe,
it is to weakneſs, not to virtue, that we
yield."</p>
            <p>"Certainly," replied the Marcheſa,
"that truth never yet was doubted;"</p>
            <p>"Pardon me, I am not ſo certain as to
that," ſaid the Confeſſor, "when juſtice
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0247200302:112"/>
happens to oppoſe prejudice, we are apt to
believe it virtuous to diſobey her. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
though the law of juſtice demands
the death of this girl, yet becauſe the law
of the land forbears to enforce it, you, my
daughter, even you! though poſſeſſed of a
man's ſpirit, and his clear perceptions,
would think that virtue bade her live, when
it was only fear!"</p>
            <p>"Hah!" exclaimed the Marcheſa, in a
low voice, "What is that you mean? You
ſhall find I have a man's courage alſo."</p>
            <p>"I ſpeak without diſguiſe," replied Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
"my meaning requires none."</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa muſed, and remained
ſilent.</p>
            <p>"I have done my duty," reſumed Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
at length. "I have pointed out the
only way that remains for you to eſcape
diſhonour. If my zeal is diſpleaſing—but
I have done."</p>
            <p>" No, good father, no," ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa;
you miſtake the cauſe of my emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0247200302:113"/>
New ideas, new proſpects, open!—they
confuſe, they diſtract me! My mind
has not yet attained ſufficient ſtrength to
encounter them; ſome woman's weakneſs
ſtill lingers at my heart."</p>
            <p>"Pardon my inconſiderate zeal," ſaid
Schedoni, with affected humility, "I hBve
been to blame. If your's is a weakneſs, it
is, at leaſt, an amiable one, and, perhaps,
deſerves to be encouraged, rather than
conquered."</p>
            <p>"How, father! If it deſerves encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
it is not a weakneſs, but a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.".</p>
            <p>"Be it ſo," ſaid Schedoni, coolly, "the
intereſt I have felt on this ſubject, has,
perhaps, miſled my judgment, and has
made me unjuſt. Think no more of it,
or, if you do, let it be only to pardon the
zeal I have teſtified."</p>
            <p>"It does not deſerve pardon, but
thanks," replied the Marcheſa, "not thanks
only, but reward. Good father, I hope it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0247200302:114"/>
will ſome time be in my power to prove
the ſincerity of my words."</p>
            <p>The Confeſſor bowed his head.</p>
            <p>"I truſt that the ſervices you have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
me, ſhall be gratefully repaid—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
I dare not hope, for what benefit
could poſſibly reward a ſervice ſo vaſt, as it
may, perhaps, be in your power to confer
upon my family! What recompence could
be balanced againſt the benefit of having
reſcued the honour of an ancient houſe!"</p>
            <p>"Your goodneſs is beyond my thanks,
or my deſert," ſaid Schedoni, and he was
again ſilent.</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa wiſhed him to lead her
back to the point, from which ſhe herſelf
had deviated, and he ſeemed determined,
that ſhe ſhould lead him thither. She
muſed, and heſitated. Her mind was not
yet familiar with atrocious guilt; and the
crime which Schedoni had ſuggeſted, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
alarmed her. She feared to think,
and ſtill more to name it; yet, ſo acutely
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0247200302:115"/>
ſuſceptible was her pride, ſo ſtern her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and ſo profound her deſire of
vengeance, that her mind was toſſed as on
a tempeſtuous ocean, and theſe terrible
feelings threatened to overwhelm all the
reſidue of humanity in her heart. Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni
obſerved all its progreſſive move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and, like a gaunt tyger, lurked in
ſilence, ready to ſpring forward at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of opportunity.</p>
            <p>"It is your advice, then, father," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the Marcheſa, after a long pauſe,—"it
is your opinion—that Ellena."—She
heſitated, deſirous that Schedoni
ſhould anticipate her meaning; but he
choſe to ſpare his own delicacy rather than
that of the Marcheſa.</p>
            <p>"You think, then, that this inſidious
girl deſerves"—She pauſed again, but
the Confeſſor, ſtill ſilent, ſeemed to wait
with ſubmiſſion for what the Marcheſa
ſhould deliver.</p>
            <p>"I repeat, father, that it is your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0247200302:116"/>
this girl deſerves ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."—</p>
            <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Schedoni, "Is
it not alſo your own?"</p>
            <p>"That not any puniſhment can be too
ſevere?" continued the Marcheſa. "That
juſtice, equally with neceſſity, demands
—her life? Is not this your opinion
too?"</p>
            <p>"O! pardon me," ſaid Schedoni, "I
may have erred; that only <hi>was</hi> my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and when I formed it, I was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
too much under the influence of zeal
to be juſt. When the heart is warm, how
is it poſſible that the judgment can be
cool."</p>
            <p>"It is <hi>not</hi> then, your opinion, holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,"
ſaid the Marcheſa with diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>"I do not abſolutely ſay that," replied
the Confeſſor.—But I leave it to your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
judgment to decide upon its juſtneſs."</p>
            <p>As he ſaid this, he roſe to depart. The
Marcheſa was agitated and perplexed,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0247200302:117"/>
and requeſted he would ſtay; but he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
himſelf by alledging, that it was
the hour when he muſt attend a particular
maſs.</p>
            <p>"Well then, holy father, I will occupy
no more of your valuable moments at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
but you know how highly I eſtimate
your advice, and will not refuſe, when I
ſhall at ſome future time requeſt it.</p>
            <p>"I cannot refuſe to accept an honour,"
replied the Confeſſor, with an air of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
"but the ſubject you allude to is
delicate"—</p>
            <p>"And therefore I muſt value, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
your opinion upon it," rejoined the
Marcheſa.</p>
            <p>"I would wiſh you to value your own,"
replied Schedoni; "you cannot have a
better director."</p>
            <p>"You flatter, father."</p>
            <p>"I only reply, my daughter."</p>
            <p>"On the evening of to-morrow," ſaid
the Marcheſa, gravely, "I ſhall be at veſpers
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0247200302:118"/>
in the church of San Nicolo; if you ſhould
happen to be there, you will probably ſee
me, when the ſervice is over, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
is departed, in the north cloiſter.
We can there converſe on the ſubject
neareſt my heart, and without obſervation.
—Farewell!"</p>
            <p>"Peace be with you, daughter! and
wiſdom council your thoughts!" ſaid Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
"I will not fail to viſit San Nicolo."</p>
            <p>He folded his hands upon his breaſt,
bowed his head, and left the apartment
with the ſilent footſtep, that indicates wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs
and conſcious duplicity.</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa remained in her cloſet,
ſhaken by ever-varying paſſions, and ever-fluctuating
opinions; meditating miſery
for others, and inflicting it only upon
herſelf.</p>

            <p>THE Marcheſa repaired, according to
her appointment, to the church of San Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colo,
and, ordering her ſervants to remain
with the carriage at a ſide-door, entered the
choir, attended only by her woman.</p>
            <p>When veſpers had concluded, ſhe lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
till nearly every perſon had quitted
the choir, and then walked through the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
aiſles to the north cloiſter. Her
heart was as heavy as her ſtep; for when
is it that peace and evil paſſions dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
As ſhe ſlowly paced the cloiſters,
ſhe perceived a monk paſſing between the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0247200302:120"/>
pillars, who, as he approached, lifted his
cowl, and ſhe knew him to be Schedoni.</p>
            <p>He inſtantly obſerved the agitation of
her ſpirits, and that her purpoſe was not
yet determined, according to his hope.
But, though his mind became clouded, his
countenance remained unaltered; it was
grave and thoughtful. The ſternneſs of
his vulture-eye was, however, ſomewhat
ſoftened, and its lids were contracted by
ſubtlety.</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa bade her woman walk
apart, while ſhe conferred with her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</p>
            <p>"This unhappy boy," ſaid ſhe, when
the attendant was at ſome diſtance, "How
much ſuffering does his folly inflict upon
his family! My good father, I have need
of all your advice and conſolation. My
mind is perpetually haunted by a ſenſe of
my misfortune; it has no reſpite; awake
or in my dream, this ungrateful ſon alike
purſues me! The only relief my heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0247200302:121"/>
is when converſing with you—my
only counſellor, my only diſintereſted
friend."</p>
            <p>The Confeſſor bowed. "The Marcheſe
is, no doubt, equally afflicted with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,"
ſaid he; "but he is, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
much more competent to adviſe you
on this delicate ſubject than I am."</p>
            <p>"The Marcheſe has prejudices, father,
as you well know; he is a ſenſible man,
but he is ſometimes miſtaken, and he is
incorrigible in error. He has the faults of
a mind that is merely well diſpoſed; he is
deſtitute of the diſcernment and the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
which would make it great. If it is
neceſſary to adopt a conduct, that departs
in the ſmalleſt degree from thoſe common
rules of morality which he has cheriſhed,
without examining them, from his infancy,
he is ſhocked, and ſhrinks from action.
He cannot diſcriminate the circumſtances,
that render the ſame action virtuous or
vicious. How then, father, are we to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0247200302:122"/>
he would approve of the bold inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>"Moſt true!" ſaid the artful Schedoni,
with an air of admiration.</p>
            <p>"We, therefore, muſt not conſult him,"
continued the Marcheſa," leſt he ſhould
now, as formerly, advance and maintain
objections, to which we cannot yield.
What paſſes in converſation with you,
father, is ſacred, it goes no farther."</p>
            <p>"Sacred as a confeſſion!" ſaid Schedoni,
croſſing himſelf.</p>
            <p>"I know not,"—reſumed the Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,
and heſitated; "I know not"—ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in a yet lower voice, "how this girl
may be diſpoſed of; and this it is which
diſtracts my mind."</p>
            <p>"I marvel much at that," ſaid Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.
"With opinions ſo ſingularly juſt,
with a mind ſo accurate, yet ſo bold as you
have diſplayed, is it poſſible that you can
heſitate as to what is to be done! You, my
daughter, will not prove yourſelf one of
thoſe ineffectual declaimers, who can think
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0247200302:123"/>
vigorously, but cannot act ſo! One way,
only, remains for you to purſue, in the
preſent inſtance; it is the ſame which your
ſuperior ſagacity pointed out, and taught
me to approve. Is it neceſſary for me
to perſuade <hi>her,</hi> by whom I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced!
There is only one way."</p>
            <p>"And on that I have been long medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating,"
replied the Marcheſa, "and, ſhall
I own my weakneſs? I cannot yet decide."</p>
            <p>"My daughter! can it be poſſible that
you ſhould want courage to ſoar above vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
prejudice, in action, though not in
opinion?" ſaid Schedoni, who, perceiving
that his aſſiſtance was neceſſary to fix her
fluctuating mind, gradually began to ſteal
forth from the prudent reſerve, in which he
had taken ſhelter.</p>
            <p>"If this perſon was condemned by the
law," he continued, "you would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
her ſentence to be juſt; yet you
dare not, I am humbled while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it, you dare not diſpenſe juſtice your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0247200302:124"/>
The Marcheſa, after ſome heſitation,
ſaid, "I have not the ſhield of the law to
protect me, father: and the boldeſt virtue
may pauſe, when it reaches the utmoſt
verge of ſafety."</p>
            <p>"Never!" replied the Confeſſor, warmly;
"virtue never trembles; it is her glory,
and ſublimeſt attribute to be ſuperior to
danger; to deſpiſe it. The beſt principle
is not virtue till it reaches this elevation."</p>
            <p>A philoſopher might, perhaps, have
been ſurprized to hear two perſons ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defining the limits of virtue, at the very
moment in which they meditated the moſt
atrocious crime; a man of the world
would have conſidered it to be mere hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy;
a ſuppoſition which might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
his general knowledge of manners,
but would certainly have betrayed his
ignorance of the human heart.</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa was for ſome time ſilent
and thoughtful, and then repeated delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
"I have not the ſhield of the law
to protect me."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0247200302:125"/>
"But you have the ſhield of the
church," replied Schedoni; "you ſhould
not only have protection, but abſolution."</p>
            <p>"Abſolution!—Does virtue—juſtice,
require abſolution, father?"</p>
            <p>"When I mentioned abſolution for the
action which you perceive to be ſo juſt and
neceſſary," replied Schedoni, "I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
my ſpeech to vulgar prejudice,
and to vulgar weakneſs. And, forgive me,
that ſince you, my daughter, deſcended
from the loftineſs of your ſpirit to regret
the ſhield of the law, I endeavoured to
conſole you, by offering a ſhield to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
But enough of this; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to argument. This girl is put out of
the way of committing more miſchief, of
injuring the peace and dignity of a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
family; ſhe is ſent to an eternal
ſleep, before her time.—Where is the
crime, where is the evil of this? On the
contrary, you perceive, and you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
me, that it is only ſtrict juſtice,
only ſelf-defence."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0247200302:126"/>
The Marcheſa was attentive, and the
Confeſſor added, "She is not immortal;
and the few years more, that might have
been allotted her, ſhe deſerves to forfeit,
ſince ſhe would have employed them in
cankering the honour of an illuſtrious houſe."</p>
            <p>"Speak low, father," ſaid the Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,
though he ſpoke almoſt in a whiſper;
"the cloiſter appears ſolitary, yet ſome
perſon may lurk behind thoſe pillars.
Adviſe me how this buſineſs may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged;
I am ignorant of the particular
means."</p>
            <p>"There is ſome hazard in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of it, I grant," replied Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni;
"I know not whom you may confide
in.—The men who make a trade of
blood"—</p>
            <p>"Huſh!" ſaid the Marcheſa, looking
round through the twilight—"a ſtep!"</p>
            <p>"It is the Friar's, yonder, who croſſes to
the choir," replied Schedoni.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0247200302:127"/>
They were watchful for a few moments,
and then he reſumed the ſubject. "Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries
ought not to be truſted,"—</p>
            <p>"Yet who but mercenaries"—inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Marcheſa, and inſtantly checked
herſelf. But the queſtion thus implied,
did not eſcape the Confeſſor.</p>
            <p>"Pardon my aſtoniſhment," ſaid he,
"at the inconſiſtency, or, what ſhall I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to call it? of your opinions! After
the acuteneſs you have diſplayed on ſome
points, is it poſſible you can doubt, that
principle may both prompt and perform
the deed? Why ſhould we heſitate to do
what we judge to be right?"</p>
            <p>"Ah! reverend father," ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa,
with emotion," but where ſhall we
find another like yourſelf—another, who
not only can perceive with juſtneſs, but
will act with energy."</p>
            <p>Schedoni was ſilent.</p>
            <p>"Such a friend is above all eſtimation;
but where ſhall we ſeek him?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0247200302:128"/>
"Daughter!" ſaid the Monk, emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
"my zeal for your family is alſo
above all calculation."</p>
            <p>"Good father," replied the Marcheſa,
comprehending his full meaning, "I know
not how to thank you."</p>
            <p>"Silence is ſometimes eloquence," ſaid
Schedoni, ſignificantly.</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa muſed; for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
alſo was eloquent. She tried to
overcome its voice, but it would be heard;
and ſometimes ſuch ſtarts of horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
came over her mind, that ſhe felt
as one who, awaking from a dream, opens
his eyes only to meaſure the depth of the
precipice on which he totters. In ſuch
moments ſhe was aſtoniſhed, that ſhe had
pauſed for an inſtant upon a ſubject ſo
terrible as that of murder. The ſophiſtry
of the Confeſſor, together with the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies
which he had betrayed, and
which had not eſcaped the notice of the
Marcheſa, even at the time they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0247200302:129"/>
though ſhe had been unconſcious of
her own, then became more ſtrongly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and ſhe almoſt determined to ſuffer
the poor Ellena to live. But returning
paſſion, like a wave that has recoiled from
the ſhore, afterwards came with recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
energy, and ſwept from her feeble mind
the barriers, which reaſon and conſcience
had begun to rear.</p>
            <p>"This confidence with which you have
thought proper to honour me," ſaid Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
at length, and pauſed; "This affair,
ſo momentous"—</p>
            <p>"Ay, this affair," interrupted the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa,
in a hurried manner,—"but when,
and where, good father? Being once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
I am anxious to have it ſettled."</p>
            <p>"That muſt be as occaſion offers," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Monk, thoughtfully.—"On the
ſhore of the Adriatic, in the province of
Apulia, not far from Manfredonia, is a
houſe that might ſuit the purpoſe. It is
a lone dwelling on the beach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0247200302:130"/>
from travellers, among the foreſts,
which ſpread for many miles along the
coaſt."</p>
            <p>"And the people?" ſaid the Marcheſa.</p>
            <p>"Ay, daughter, or why travel ſo far as
Apulia? It is inhabited by one poor man,
who ſuſtains a miſerable exiſtence by fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I know him, and could unfold the
reaſons of his ſolitary life;—but no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is ſufficient that <hi>I know him.".</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"And would truſt him, father?"</p>
            <p>"Ay, lady, with the life of this girl—though
ſcarcely with my own."</p>
            <p>"How! If he is ſuch a villain he may not
be truſted! think further. But now, you
objected to a mercenary, yet this man is
one!"</p>
            <p>"Daughter, he may be truſted, when it
is in ſuch a caſe; he is ſafe and ſure. I
have reaſon to know him."</p>
            <p>"Name your reaſons, father."</p>
            <p>The Confeſſor was ſilent, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
aſſumed a very peculiar character;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0247200302:131"/>
it was more terrible than uſual, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread
with a dark, cadaverous hue of
mingled anger and guilt. The Marcheſa
ſtarted involuntarily as, paſſing by a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
the evening gleam that fell there, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
it; and for the firſt time ſhe wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ſhe had not committed herſelf ſo
wholly to his power. But the die was now
caſt; it was too late to be prudent; and
ſhe again demanded his reaſons.</p>
            <p>"No matter," ſaid Schedoni, in a ſtifled
voice—"ſhe dies!"</p>
            <p>"By his hands?" aſked the Marcheſa,
with ſtrong emotion. "Think, once more,
father."</p>
            <p>They were both again ſilent and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The Marcheſa, at length, ſaid, "Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I rely upon your integrity and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;"
and ſhe laid a very flattering em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis
upon the word integrity. "But I
conjure you to let this buſineſs be finiſhed
quickly, ſuſpenſe is to me the purgatory
of this world, and not to truſt the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0247200302:132"/>
of it to a ſecond perſon." She
pauſed, and then added, "I would not
willingly owe ſo vaſt a debt of obligation
to any other than yourſelf."</p>
            <p>"Your requeſt, daughter, that I would
not confide this buſineſs to a ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,"
ſaid Schedoni, with diſpleaſure, "can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be accorded to. Can you ſuppoſe,
that I, myſelf"—</p>
            <p>"Can I doubt that principle may both
prompt and perform the deed," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Marcheſa with quickneſs,
and anticipating his meaning, while ſhe
retorted upon him his former words.
"Why ſhould we heſitate to do what we
judge to be right?"</p>
            <p>The ſilence of Schedoni alone indicated
his diſpleaſure, which the Marcheſa imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
underſtood.</p>
            <p>"Conſider, good father," ſhe added
ſignificantly, "how painful it muſt be to
me, to owe to infinite an obligation to
a ſtranger, or to any other than ſo highly
valued a friend as yourſelf."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0247200302:133"/>
Schedoni, while he detected her mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and perſuaded himſelf that he deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the flattery, with which ſhe ſo thinly
veiled it, unconſciouſly ſuffered his ſelf-love
to be ſoothed by the compliment.
He bowed his head, in ſignal of conſent to
her wiſh.</p>
            <p>"Avoid violence, if that be poſſible,"
ſhe added, immediately comprehending
him, "but let her die quickly! The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
is due to the crime."</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa happened, as ſhe ſaid this,
to caſt her eyes upon the inſcription over
a Confeſſional, where appeared, in black
letters, theſe awful words, "<hi>God hears
thee!".</hi> It appeared an awful warning.
Her countenance changed; it had ſtruck
upon her heart. Schedoni was too much
engaged by his own thoughts to obſerve,
or underſtand her ſilence. She ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
herſelf; and conſidering that this
was a common inſcription for Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionals,
diſregarded what ſhe had at firſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0247200302:134"/>
conſidered as a peculiar admonition; yet
ſome moments elapſed, before ſhe could
renew the ſubject.</p>
            <p>"You was ſpeaking of a place, father,"
reſumed the Marcheſa—"you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
a"—</p>
            <p>"Ay," muttered the Confeſſor, ſtill
muſing,—"in a chamber of that houſe
there is"—</p>
            <p>"What noiſe is that?" ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa,
interrupting him. They liſtened. A few low and querulous notes of the
organ ſounded at a diſtance, and ſtopped
again.</p>
            <p>"What mournful muſic is that?" ſaid
the Marcheſa in a faultering voice, "It
was touched by a fearful hand! Veſpers
were over long ago!"</p>
            <p>"Daughter," ſaid Schedoni, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſternly, "you ſaid you had a man's
courage. Alas! you have a woman's
heart."</p>
            <p>"Excuſe me, father; I know not why
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0247200302:135"/>
I feel this agitation, but I will command
it. That chamber?"—</p>
            <p>"In that chamber," reſumed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
"is a ſecret door, conſtructed long
ago."—</p>
            <p>"And for what purpoſe conſtructed?"
ſaid the fearful Marcheſa.</p>
            <p>"Pardon me, daughter; 'tis ſufficient
that it is there; we will make a good uſe
of it. Through that door—in the night—when
ſhe ſleeps"—</p>
            <p>"I comprehend you," ſaid the Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,
"I comprehend you. But why, you
have your reaſons, no doubt, but why the
neceſſity of a ſecret door in a houſe which
you ſay is ſo lonely—inhabited by only
one perſon?"</p>
            <p>"A paſſage leads to the ſea," continued
Schedoni, without replying to the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
"There, on the ſhore, when dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
covers it; there, plunged amidſt the
waves, no ſtain ſhall hint of"—</p>
            <p>"Hark!" interrupted the Marcheſa,
ſtarting, "that note again!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0247200302:136"/>
The organ ſounded faintly from the
choir, and pauſed, as before. In the next
moment, a ſlow chaunting of voices was
heard, mingling with the riſing peal, in a
ſtrain particularly melancholy and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn.</p>
            <p>"Who is dead? ſaid the Marcheſa,
changing countenance; "it is a requiem!"</p>
            <p>"Peace be with the departed!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Schedoni, and croſſed himſelf;
"Peace reſt with his ſoul!"</p>
            <p>"Hark! to that chaunt!" ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa,
in a trembling voice; "it is a firſt
requiem; the ſoul has but juſt quitted
the body!"</p>
            <p>They liſtened in ſilence. The Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa
was much affected; her complexion
varied at every inſtant; her breathings
were ſhort and interrupted, and ſhe even
ſhed a few tears, but they were thoſe of
deſpair, rather than of ſorrow. "That
body is now cold," ſaid ſhe to herſelf,
"which but an hour ago was warm and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0247200302:137"/>
animated! Thoſe fine ſenſes are cloſed in
death! And to this condition would I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a being like myſelf! Oh, wretched,
wretched mother! to what has the folly of
a ſon reduced thee!"</p>
            <p>She turned from the Confeſſor, and
walked alone in the cloiſter. Her agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
encreaſed; ſhe wept without reſtraint,
for her veil and the evening gloom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
her, and her ſighs were loſt amidſt
the muſic of the choir.</p>
            <p>Schedoni was ſcarcely leſs diſturbed,
but his were emotions of apprehenſion and
contempt. "Behold, what is woman!"
ſaid he—"The ſlave of her paſſions, the
dupe of her ſenſes! When pride and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
ſpeak in her breaſt, ſhe defies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles,
and laughs at crimes! Aſſail but
her ſenſes, let muſic, for inſtance, touch
ſome feeble chord of her heart, and echo
to her fancy, and lo! all her perceptions
change:—ſhe ſhrinks from the act ſhe had
but an inſtant before believed meritorious,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0247200302:138"/>
yields to ſome new emotion, and ſinks—the
victim of a ſound! O, weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
being!"</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa, at leaſt, ſeemed to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
his obſervations. The deſperate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which had reſiſted every remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance
of reaſon and humanity, were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
only by other paſſions; and, her
ſenſes touched by the mournful melody of
muſic, and her ſuperſtitious fears awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the occurrence of a requiem for the
dead, at the very moment when ſhe was
planning murder, ſhe yielded, for a while,
to the united influence of pity and terror.
Her agitation did not ſubſide; but ſhe
returned to the Confeſſor.</p>
            <p>"We will converſe on this buſineſs at
ſome future time," ſaid ſhe; "at preſent,
my ſpirits are diſordered. Good night,
father! Remember me in your ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons."</p>
            <p>"Peace be with you, lady!" ſaid
the Confeſſor, bowing gravely, "You
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0247200302:139"/>
ſhall not be forgotten. Be reſolute, and
yourſelf."</p>
            <p>The Marcheſa beckoned her woman to
approach, when, drawing her veil cloſer,
and leaning upon the attendant's arm, ſhe
left the cloiſter. Schedoni remained for
a moment on the ſpot, looking after her,
till her figure was loſt in the gloom of the
long perſpective; he then, with thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſteps, quitted the cloiſter by another
door. He was diſappointed, but he did
not deſpair.</p>

            <p>WHILE the Marcheſa and the Monk
were thus meditating conſpiracies againſt
Ellena, ſhe was ſtill in the Urſaline con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
on the lake of Celano. In this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
ſanctuary, indiſpoſition, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the long and ſevere anxiety ſhe
had ſuffered, compelled her to remain. A
fever was on her ſpirits, and an univerſal
laſſitude prevailed over her frame; which
became the more effectual, from her very
ſolicitude to conquer it. Every approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0247200302:141"/>
day ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould be able to
purſue her journey homeward, yet every day
found her as incapable of travelling as the
laſt, and the ſecond week was already gone,
before the fine air of Celano, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of her aſylum, began to revive her.
Vivaldi, who was her daily viſitor at the
grate of the convent; and who, watching
over her with intenſe ſolicitude, had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
forbore to renew a ſubject, which,
by agitating her ſpirits, might affect her
health, now, that her health ſtrengthened,
ventured gradually to mention his fears left
the place of her retreat ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and left he yet might irrecoverably
loſe her, unleſs ſhe would approve of their
ſpeedy marriage. At every viſit he now
urged the ſubject, repreſented the dangers
that ſurrounded them, and repeated his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and entreaties; for now, when
he believed that time was preſſing forward
fatal evils, he could no longer attend to
the delicate ſcruples, that bade him be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0247200302:142"/>
ſparing in entreaty. Ellena, had ſhe obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the dictates of her heart, would have
rewarded his attachment and his ſervices,
by a frank approbation of his propoſal;
but the objections which reaſon exhibited
againſt ſuch a conceſſion, ſhe could neither
overcome or diſregard.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, after he had again repreſented
their preſent dangers, and claimed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of her hand, received in the preſence
of her deceaſed relative, Signora Bianchi,
gently ventured to remind her, that an
event as ſudden as lamentable, had firſt
deferred their nuptials, and that if Bianchi
had lived, Ellena would have beſtowed,
long ſince, the vows he now ſolicited.
Again he intreated her, by every ſacred and
tender recollection, to conclude the fearful
uncertainty of their fate, and to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the right to protect her, before they
ventured forth from this temporary aſylum.</p>
            <p>Ellena immediately admitted the ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the promiſe, which ſhe had formerly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0247200302:143"/>
given, and aſſured Vivaldi that ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
herſelf as indiſſolubly bound to wed
him as if it had been given at the altar;
but ſhe objected to a confirmation of it,
till his family ſhould ſeem willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her for their daughter; when, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the injuries ſhe had received from
them, ſhe would no longer refuſe their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.
She added, that Vivaldi ought to
be more jealous of the dignity of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whom he honoured with his eſteem,
than to permit her making a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi felt the full force of this appeal;
he recollected, with anguiſh, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of which ſhe was happily ignorant,
but which ſerved to ſtrengthen with him
the juſtneſs of her reproof. And, as the
aſperſions which the Marcheſe had thrown
upon her name, crowded to his memory,
pride and indignation ſwelled his heart,
and ſo far overcame apprehenſion of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
that he formed a momentary reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0247200302:144"/>
to abandon every other conſideration,
to that of aſſerting the reſpect which was
due to Ellena, and to forbear, claiming her
for his wife, till his family ſhould make
acknowledgment of their error, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
admit her in the rank of their child.
But this reſolution was as tranſient as
plauſible; other conſiderations, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
fears preſſed upon him. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the ſtrong improbability, that they
would ever make a voluntary ſacrifice of
their pride to his love; or yield miſtakes,
nurtured by prejudice and by willing indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
to truth and a ſenſe of juſtice. In
the mean time, the plans, which would be
formed for ſeparating him from Ellena,
might ſucceed, and he ſhould loſe her for
ever. Above all, it appeared, that the beſt,
the only method, which remained for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
the daring aſperſions that had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
her name, was, by proving the high
reſpect he himſelf felt for her, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her to the world in the ſacred charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0247200302:145"/>
of his wife. Theſe conſiderations
quickly determined him to perſevere in
his ſuit; but it was impoſſible to urge
them to Ellena, ſince the circumſtances
they muſt unfold, would not only ſhock
her delicacy and afflict her heart, but
would furniſh the proper pride ſhe cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with new arguments againſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a family, who had thus groſſly inſulted
her.</p>
            <p>While theſe conſiderations occupied
him, the emotion they occaſioned did not
eſcape Ellena's obſervation; it encreaſed,
as he reflected on the impoſſibility of urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to her, and on the hopeleſsneſs
of prevailing with her, unleſs he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
new arguments in his favour. His
unaffected diſtreſs awakened all her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
and gratitude; ſhe aſked herſelf
whether ſhe ought any longer to aſſert
her own rights, when by doing ſo, ſhe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
the peace of him, who had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſo much danger for her ſake, who had
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0247200302:146"/>
reſcued her from ſevere oppreſſion, and had
ſo long and ſo well proved the ſtrength
of his affection.</p>
            <p>As ſhe applied theſe queſtions, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to herſelf an unjuſt and ſelfiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
unwilling to make any ſacrifice for the
tranquillity of him, who had given her
liberty, even at the riſk of his life. Her
very virtues, now that they were carried
to exceſs, ſeemed to her to border upon
vices; her ſenſe of dignity, appeared to be
narrow pride; her delicacy weakneſs; her
moderated affection cold ingratitude; and
her circumſpection, little leſs than pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
degenerated into meanneſs.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, as apt in admitting hope as fear,
immediately perceived her reſolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to yield, and he urged again every
argument which was likely to prevail over
it. But the ſubject was too important
for Ellena, to be immediately decided
upon; he departed with only a faint aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of encouragement; and ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0247200302:147"/>
him to return till the following day,
when ſhe would acquaint him with her
final determination.</p>
            <p>This interval was, perhaps, the moſt
painful he had ever experienced. Alone,
and on the banks of the lake, he paſſed
many hours in alternate hope and fear;
in endeavouring to anticipate the deciſion,
on which ſeemed ſuſpended all his future
peace, and abruptly recoiling from it, as
often as imagination repreſented it to be
adverſe.</p>
            <p>Of the walls, that encloſed her, he
ſcarcely ever loſt ſight; the view of them
ſeemed to cheriſh his hopes, and, while he
gazed upon their rugged ſurface, Ellena
alone was pictured on his fancy; till his
anxiety to learn her diſpoſition towards him
aroſe to agony, and he would abruptly leave
the ſpot. But an inviſible ſpell ſtill ſeemed
to attract him back again, and evening
found him pacing ſlowly beneath the ſhade
of thoſe melancholy boundaries that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
his Ellena.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0247200302:148"/>
Her day was not more tranquil. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
prudence and decorous pride forbade
her to become a member of the Vivaldi
family, as conſtantly did gratitude, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
irreſiſtible tenderneſs plead the cauſe
of Vivaldi The memory of paſt times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
and the very accents of the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeemed to murmur from the grave, and
command her to fulfil the engagement,
which had ſoothed the dying moments of
Bianchi.</p>
            <p>On the following morning, Vivaldi was
at the gates of the convent, long before the
appointed hour, and he lingered in dreadful
impatience, till the clock ſtruck the ſignal
for his entrance.</p>
            <p>Ellena was already in the parlour; ſhe
was alone, and roſe in diſorder on his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
His ſteps faultered, his voice was
loſt, and his eyes only, which he fixed with
a wild earneſtneſs on her's, had power to
enquire her reſolution. She obſerved the
paleneſs of his countenance, and his emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0247200302:149"/>
with a mixture of concern and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
At that moment, he perceived
her ſmile, and hold out her hand to him;
and fear, care, and doubt vaniſhed at once
from his mind. He was incapable of
thanking her, but ſighed deeply as he
preſſed her hand, and, overcome with joy,
ſupported himſelf againſt the grate that
ſeparated them.</p>
            <p>"You are, then, indeed my own!" ſaid
Vivaldi, at length recovering his voice—"We
ſhall be no more parted—you are
mine for ever! But your countenance
changes! O heaven! ſurely I have not
miſtaken! Speak! I conjure you, Ellena;
relieve me from theſe terrible doubts!"</p>
            <p>"I am yours, Vivaldi," replied Ellena
faintly, "oppreſſion can part us no more."</p>
            <p>She wept, and drew her veil over her
eyes.</p>
            <p>"What mean thoſe tears?" ſaid Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,
with alarm. "Ah! Ellena," he added
in a ſoftened voice, "ſhould tears mingle
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0247200302:150"/>
with ſuch moments as theſe! Should your
tears fall upon my heart now! They tell
me, that your conſent is given with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance—with
grief; that your love is fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
your heart—yes Ellena! that your
whole heart is no longer mine!"</p>
            <p>"They ought rather to tell you," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Ellena, "that it is all your own;
that my affection never was more powerful
than now, when it can overcome every
conſideration with reſpect to your family,
and urge me to a ſtep which muſt degrade
me in their eyes,—and, I fear, in my own."</p>
            <p>"O retract that cruel aſſertion!" inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Vivaldi, "Degrade you in your
own!—degrade you in their eyes!" He
was much agitated; his countenance was
fluſhed, and an air of more than uſual
dignity dilated his figure.</p>
            <p>"The time ſhall come, my Ellena," he
added with energy, "when they ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
your worth, and acknowledge
your excellence. O! that I were an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0247200302:151"/>
that I might ſhew to all the world
how much I love and honour you!"</p>
            <p>Ellena gave him her hand, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
her veil, ſmiled on him through
her tears, with gratitude and reviving cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
            <p>Before Vivaldi retired to the convent,
he obtained her conſent to conſult with an
aged Benedictine, whom he had engaged
in his intereſt, as to the hour at which the
marriage might be ſolemnized with leaſt
obſervation. The prieſt informed him,
that at the concluſion of the veſper-ſervice,
he ſhould be diſengaged for ſeveral hours;
and that, as the firſt hour after ſun-ſet was
more ſolitary than almoſt any other, the
brotherhood being then aſſembled in the
refectory, he would meet Vivaldi and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena
at that time, in a chapel on the edge
of the lake, a ſhort diſtance from the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine
convent, to which it belonged,
and celebrate their nuptials.</p>
            <p>With this propoſal, Vivaldi imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0247200302:152"/>
returned to Ellena; when it was
agreed that the party ſhould aſſemble at
the hour mentioned by the prieſt. Ellena,
who had thought it proper to mention her
intention to the Abbeſs of the Urſalines,
was, by her permiſſion, to be attended by a
lay-ſiſter; and Vivaldi was to meet her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the walls, and conduct her to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.
When the ceremony was over, the
fugitives were to embark in a veſſel, hired
for the purpoſe, and, croſſing the lake, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
towards Naples. Vivaldi again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to engage a boat, and Ellena to
prepare for the continuance of her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>As the appointed hour drew near, her
ſpirits ſunk, and ſhe watched with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
foreboding, the ſun retiring amidſt
ſtormy clouds, and his rays fading from the
higheſt points of the mountains, till the
gloom of twilight prevailed over the ſcene.
She then left her apartment, took a
grateful leave of the hoſpitable Abbeſs,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0247200302:153"/>
and, attended by the lay-ſiſter, quitted the
convent.</p>
            <p>Immediately without the gate ſhe was
met by Vivaldi, whoſe look, as he put her
arm within his, gently reproached her for
the dejection of her air.</p>
            <p>They walked in ſilence towards the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of San Sebaſtian. The ſcene appeared
to ſympathize with the ſpirits of Ellena.
It was a gloomy evening, and the lake,
which broke in dark waves upon the ſhore,
mingled its hollow ſounds with thoſe of
the wind, that bowed the lofty pines, and
ſwept in guſts among the rocks. She ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
with alarm the heavy thunder
clouds, that rolled along the ſides of the
mountains, and the birds circling ſwiftly
over the waters, and ſcudding away to
their neſts among the cliffs; and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
to Vivaldi, that, as a ſtorm ſeemed
approaching, ſhe wiſhed to avoid croſſing
the lake. He immediately ordered Paulo
to diſmiſs the boat, and to be in waiting
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0247200302:154"/>
with a carriage, that, if the weather ſhould
become clear, they might not be detained
longer than was otherwiſe neceſſary.</p>
            <p>As they approached the chapel, Ellena
fixed her eyes on the mournful cypreſſes
which waved over it, and ſighed. "Thoſe,"
ſhe ſaid, "are funereal mementos—not
ſuch as ſhould grace the altar of marriage!
Vivaldi, I could be ſupperſtitious.—Think
you not they are portentous of future mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune?
But forgive me; my ſpirits are
weak."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi endeavoured to ſoothe her mind,
and tenderly reproached her for the ſadneſs
ſhe indulged. Thus they entered the
chapel. Silence, and a kind of gloomy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchral
light, prevailed within. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Benedictine, with a brother, who
was to ſerve as guardian to the bride, were
already there, but they were kneeling, and
engaged in prayer.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi led the trembling Ellena to the
altar, where they waited till the Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0247200302:155"/>
ſhould have finiſhed, and theſe were
moments of great emotion. She often
looked round the duſky chapel, in fearful
expectation of diſcovering ſome lurking
obſerver; and, though ſhe knew it to be
very improbable, that any perſon in this
neighbourhood could be intereſted in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
the ceremony, her mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily
admitted the poſſibility of it.
Once, indeed, as her eyes glanced over a
caſement, Ellena fancied she diſtinguiſhed
a human face laid cloſe to the glaſs, as if to
watch what was paſſing within; but when
ſhe looked again, the apparition was gone.
Notwithſtanding this, ſhe liſtened with
anxiety to the uncertain ſounds without,
and ſometimes ſtarted as the ſurges of the
lake daſhed over the rock below, almoſt
believing ſhe heard the ſteps and whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
voices of men in the avenues of the
chapel. She tried, however, to ſubdue
apprehenſion, by conſidering, that if this
were true, an harmleſs curioſity might
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0247200302:156"/>
have attracted ſome inhabitants of the
convent hither, and her ſpirits became
more compoſed, till ſhe obſerved a door
open a little way, and a dark countenance
looking from behind it. In the next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
it retreated, and the door was cloſed.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, who perceived Ellena's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
change, as ſhe laid her hand on
his arm, followed her eyes to the door, but,
no perſon appearing, he enquired the
cauſe of her alarm.</p>
            <p>"We are obſerved," ſaid Ellena, "ſome
perſon appeared at that door!"</p>
            <p>"And if we are obſerved, my love," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Vivaldi, "who is there in this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
whoſe obſervation we can have
reaſon to fear? Good father, diſpatch," he
added, turning to the prieſt, "you forget
that we are waiting."</p>
            <p>The officiating prieſt made a ſignal that
he had nearly concluded his oriſon; but
the other brother roſe immediately, and
ſpoke with Vivaldi, who deſired that the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0247200302:157"/>
doors of the chapel might be faſtened to
prevent intruſion.</p>
            <p>"We dare not bar the gates of this holy
temple," replied the Benedictine, "it is a
ſanctuary, and never may be cloſed."</p>
            <p>"But you will allow me to repreſs idle
curioſity," ſaid Vivaldi, "and to enquire
who watches beyond that door? The
tranquillity of this lady demands thus
much."</p>
            <p>The brother aſſented, and Vivaldi ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to the door; but perceiving no perſon
in the obſcure paſſage beyond it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with lighter ſteps to the altar,
from which the officiating prieſt now
roſe.</p>
            <p>"My children," ſaid he," I have made
you wait,—but an old man's prayers are
not leſs important than a young man's
vows, though this is not a moment when
you will admit that truth."</p>
            <p>"I will allow whatever you pleaſe,
good father," replied Vivaldi, "if you will
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0247200302:158"/>
adminiſter thoſe vows, without further
delay;—time preſſes."</p>
            <p>The venerable prieſt took his ſtation at
the altar, and opened the book. Vivaldi
placed himſelf on his right hand, and with
looks of anxious love, endeavoured to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Ellena, who, with a dejected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
which her veil but ill concealed,
and eyes fixed on the ground, leaned on
her attendant ſiſter. The figure and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
features of this ſiſter; the tall ſtature
and harſh viſage of the brother, clothed in
the gray habit of his order; the ſilvered
head and placid phyſiognomy of the offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
prieſt, enlightened by a gleam from
the lamp above, oppoſed to the youthful
grace and ſpirit of Vivaldi, and the milder
beauty and ſweetneſs of Ellena, formed
altogether a group worthy of the pencil.</p>
            <p>The prieſt had begun the ceremony, when
a noiſe from without again alarmed Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
who obſerved the door once more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
opened, and a man bend forward his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0247200302:159"/>
gigantic figure from behind it. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a torch, and its glare, as the door gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
uncloſed, diſcovered other perſons
in the paſſage beyond, looking forward
over his ſhoulder into the chapel. The
fierceneſs of their air, and the ſtrange pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity
of their dreſs, inſtantly convinced
Ellena that they were not inhabitants of
the Benedictine convent, but ſome terrible
meſſengers of evil, Her half-ſtifled ſhriek
alarmed Vivaldi, who caught her before
ſhe fell to the ground; but, as he had not
faced the door, he did not underſtand the
occaſion of her terror, till the ſudden ruſh
of footſteps made him turn, when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
ſeveral men armed, and very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
habited, advancing towards the
altar.</p>
            <p>"Who is he that intrudes upon this
ſanctuary?" he demanded ſternly, while he
half roſe from the ground where Ellena
had ſunk.</p>
            <p>"What ſacrilegious footſteps," cried
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0247200302:160"/>
the prieſt "thus rudely violate this holy
placed?"</p>
            <p>Ellena was now inſenſible; and the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuing
to advance, Vivaldi drew his
ſword to protect her.</p>
            <p>The prieſt and Vivaldi now ſpoke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but the words of neither could be
diſtinguiſhed, when a voice, tremendous
from its loudneſs; like burſting thunder,
diſſipated the cloud of myſtery.</p>
            <p>"You Vincentio di Vivaldi, and of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;"
it ſaid, "and you Ellena di Roſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,
of Villa Altieri, we ſummon you to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
in the name of the moſt holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition!"</p>
            <p>"The Inquiſition!" exclaimed Vivaldi,
ſcarcely believing what he heard. "Here
is ſome miſtake!"</p>
            <p>The official repeated the ſummons,
without deigning to reply.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, yet more aſtoniſhed, added,
"Do not imagine you can ſo far impoſe
upon my credulity, as that I can believe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0247200302:161"/>
myſelf to have fallen within the cognizance
of the Inquiſition."</p>
            <p>"You may believe what you pleaſe,
Signor," replied the chief officer, "but you
and that lady are our priſoners."</p>
            <p>"Begone, impoſtor!" ſaid Vivaldi,
ſpringing from the ground, where he had
ſupported Ellena," or my ſword ſhall teach
you to repent your audacity!"</p>
            <p>"Do you inſult an officer of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition!"
exclaimed the ruffian. "That
holy Community will inform you what
you incur by reſiſting it's mandate."</p>
            <p>The prieſt interrupted Vivaldi's retort,
"If you are really officers of that tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
tribunal," he ſaid, "produce ſome
proof of your office. Remember this place
is ſanctified, and tremble for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of impoſition. You do wrong to
believe, that I will deliver up to you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who have taken refuge here, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an unequivocal demand from that
dread power."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0247200302:162"/>
"Produce your form of ſummons,"
demanded Vivaldi, with haughty impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p>"It is here," replied the official, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth a black ſcroll, which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the prieſt, "Read, and be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied!"</p>
            <p>The Benedictine ſtarted the inſtant he
beheld the ſcroll, but he received and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
examined it. The kind of parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the impreſſion of the ſeal, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
form of words, the private ſignals,
underſtood only by the initiated—all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
this to be a true inſtrument of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtation
from the <hi>Holy Office.</hi> The ſcroll
dropped from his hand, and he fixed his
eyes, with ſurprize and unutterable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
upon Vivaldi, who ſtooped to
reach the parchment, when it was ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the official.</p>
            <p>"Unhappy young man!" ſaid the prieſt,
"it is too true; you are ſummoned by
that awful power, to anſwer to your crime,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0247200302:163"/>
and I am ſpared from the commiſſion of a
terrible offence!"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi appeared thunderſtruck. "For
what crime, holy father, am I called upon
to anſwer? This is ſome bold and artful
impoſture, ſince it can delude even you!
What crime—what offence?"</p>
            <p>"I did not think you had been thus
hardened in guilt!" replied the prieſt,
"Forbear! add not the audacity of falfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to the headlong, paſſions of youth.
You underſtand too well your crime,"</p>
            <p>"Falſehood!" retorted Vivaldi, "But
your years, old man, and thoſe ſacred veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
protect you. For theſe ruffians,
who have dared to implicate that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
victim," pointing to Ellena, "in the
charge, they ſhall have juſtice from my
vengeance."</p>
            <p>"Forbear! forbear!" ſaid the prieſt,
ſeizing his arm, "have pity on yourſelf
and on her. Know you not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you incur from reſiſtance.?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0247200302:164"/>
"I know nor care not," replied Vivaldi,
"but I will defend Ellena di Roſalba to
the laſt moment. Let them approach if
they dare."</p>
            <p>"It is on her, on her who lies ſenſeleſs
at your feet," ſaid the prieſt, "that they
will wreck their vengeance for theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults;
on her—the partner of your guilt."</p>
            <p>"The partner of my guilt!" exclaimed
Vivaldi, with mingled aſtoniſhment and
indignation—"of my guilt!"</p>
            <p>"Raſh young man! does not the very
veil ſhe wears betray it? I marvel how it
could paſs my obſervation!"</p>
            <p>"You have ſtolen a nun from her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,"
ſaid the chief officer, "and muſt
anſwer for the crime. When you have
wearied yourſelf with theſe heroics, Signor,
you muſt go with us; our patience is
wearied already."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi obſerved, for the firſt time, that
Ellena was ſhrouded in a nun's veil; it
was the one which Olivia had lent, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0247200302:165"/>
her from the notice of the Abbeſs,
on the night of her departure from San
Stefano, and which, in the hurry of that
departure, ſhe had forgotten to leave with
the nun. During this interval, her mind
had been too entirely occupied by cares
and apprehenſion to allow her once to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the veil ſhe wore was other than
her uſual one; but it had been too well
obſerved by ſome of the Urſaline ſiſters.</p>
            <p>Though he knew not how to account
for the circumſtance of the veil, Vivaldi
began to perceive others which gave co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to the charge brought againſt him,
and to aſcertain the wide circumference of
the ſnare that was ſpread around him.
He fancied, too, that he perceived the
hand of Schedoni employed upon it, and
that his dark ſpirit was now avenging it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for the expoſure he had ſuffered in the
church of the Spirito Santo, and for all the
conſequent: mortifications. As Vivaldi
was ignorant of the ambitious hopes which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0247200302:166"/>
the Marcheſa had encouraged in father
Schedoni, he did not ſee the improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the Confeſſor would have dared to
hazard her favour by this arreſt of her ſon;
much leſs could he ſuſpect, that Schedoni,
having done ſo, had ſecrets in his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which enabled him ſafely to defy her
reſentment, and bind her in ſilence to his
decree.</p>
            <p>With the conviction, that Schedoni's
was the maſter-hand that directed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
manoeuvre, Vivaldi ſtood aghaſt, and
gazing in ſilent unutterable anguiſh on El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,
who, as ſhe began to revive, ſtretched
forth her helpleſs hands, and called upon
him to ſave her, "Do not leave me," ſaid
ſhe in accents the moſt ſupplicating, "I
am ſafe while you are with me."</p>
            <p>At the ſound of her voice, he ſtarted
from his trance, and turning fiercely
upon the ruffians, who ſtood in ſullen
watchfulneſs around, bade them depart,
or prepare for his fury. At the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0247200302:167"/>
they all drew their ſwords, and the
ſhrieks of Ellena, and the ſupplications of
the officiating prieſt, were loſt amidſt the
tumult of the combatants.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, moſt unwilling to ſhed blood,
ſtood merely on the defenſive, till the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of his antagoniſts compelled him to
exert all his ſkill and ſtrength. He then
diſabled one of the ruffians; but his ſkill
was inſufficient to repel the other two, and
he was nearly overcome, when ſteps were
heard approaching, and Paulo ruſhed into
the chapel. Perceiving his maſter beſet,
he drew his ſword, and came furiouſly to
his aid. He fought with unconquerable
audacity and fierceneſs, till nearly at the
moment when his adverſary fell, other ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians
entered the chapel, and Vivaldi with
his faithful ſervant was wounded, and, at
length, diſarmed.</p>
            <p>Ellena, who had been withheld from
throwing herſelf between the combatants,
now, on obſerving that Vivaldi was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0247200302:168"/>
renewed her efforts for liberty, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by ſuch agony of ſupplication and
complaint, as almoſt moved to pity the
hearts of the ſurrounding ruffians.</p>
            <p>Diſabled by his wounds, and alſo held
by his enemies, Vivaldi was compelled to
witneſs her diſtreſs and danger, without a
hope of reſcuing her. In frantic accents
he called upon the old prieſt to protect
her.</p>
            <p>"I dare not oppoſe the orders of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,"
replied the Benedictine, "even
if I had ſufficient ſtrength to defy it's offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials.
Know you not, unhappy young
man, that it is death to reſiſt them?"</p>
            <p>"Death!" exclaimed Ellena, "death!"</p>
            <p>"Ay lady, too ſurely ſo!"</p>
            <p>"Signor, it would have been well for
you," ſaid one of the officers, "if you had
taken my advice; you will pay dearly for
what you have done," pointing to the ruffian,
who lay ſeverely wounded on the
ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0247200302:169"/>
"My maſter will not have that to pay
for, friend," ſaid Paulo, "for if you muſt
know, that is a piece of my work; and, if
my arms were now at liberty, I would try
if I could not match it among one of you,
though I am ſo ſlaſhed."</p>
            <p>"Peace, good Paulo! the deed was
mine," ſaid Vivaldi; then addreſſing the
official, "For myſelf I care not, I have
done my duty—but for her!—Can you
look upon her, innocent and helpleſs as
ſhe is, and not relent! Can you, will you,
barbarians! drag her, alſo, to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon a charge too ſo daringly
falſe?"</p>
            <p>"Our relenting would be of no ſervice
to her," replied the official, "we muſt do
our duty. Whether the charge is true or
falſe, ſhe muſt anſwer to it before her
judges."</p>
            <p>"What charge?" demanded Ellena.</p>
            <p>"The charge of having broken your
nun's vows," replied the prieſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0247200302:170"/>
Ellena raiſed her eyes to heaven "Is it
even ſo!" ſhe exclaimed.</p>
            <p>"You hear ſhe acknowledges the
crime," ſaid one of the ruffians.</p>
            <p>"She acknowledges no crime," replied
Vivaldi; "ſhe only perceives the extent of
the malice that perſecutes her. O! El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,
muſt I then abandon you to their
power! leave you for ever!"</p>
            <p>The agony of this thought re-animated
him with momentary ſtrength; he burſt
from the graſp of the officials, and once
more claſped Ellena to his boſom, who,
unable to ſpeak, wept, with the anguiſh of
a breaking heart, as her head ſunk upon
his ſhoulder. The ruffians around them
ſo far reſpected their grief, that, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they did not interrupt it.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi's exertion was tranſient; faint
from ſorrow, and from loſs of blood, he
became unable to ſupport himſelf, and was
compelled again to relinquiſh Ellena.</p>
            <p>"Is there no help?" ſaid ſhe, with
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0247200302:171"/>
agony; "will you ſuffer him to expire on
the ground?"</p>
            <p>The prieſt directed, that he ſhould be
conveyed to the Benedictine convent,
where his wounds might be examined,
and medical aid adminiſtered. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
ruffians were already carried thither;
but Vivaldi refuſed to go, unleſs Ellena
might accompany him. It was contrary
to the rules of the place, that a woman
ſhould enter it, and before the prieſt could
reply, his Benedictine brother eagerly ſaid,
that they dared not tranſgreſs the law of
the convent.</p>
            <p>Ellena's fears for Vivaldi entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
thoſe for herſelf, and ſhe entreated,
that he would ſuffer himſelf to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the Benedictines; but he could
not be prevailed with to leave her. The
officials, however, prepared to ſeparate
them; Vivaldi in vain urged the uſeleſs
cruelty of dividing him from Ellena, if, as
they had hinted, ſhe alſo was to be carried
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0247200302:172"/>
to the Inquiſition; and as ineffectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
whither they really deſigned to
take her.</p>
            <p>"We ſhall take good care of her, Signor,"
ſaid an officer, "that is ſufficient for you.
It ſignifies nothing whether you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame way, you mull not go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</p>
            <p>"Why, did you ever hear, Signor, of
arreſted perſons being ſuffered to remain
in company?" ſaid another ruffian, "Fine
plots they would lay; I warrant they
would not contradict each other's evidence
a tittle."</p>
            <p>"You ſhall not ſeparate me from my
maſter, though," vociferated Paulo; "I
demand to be ſent to the Inquiſition with
him, or to the devil, but all is one for
that."</p>
            <p>"Fair and ſoftly," replied the officer;
"you ſhall be ſent to the Inquiſition firſt,
and to the devil afterwards; you muſt be
tried before you are condemned."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0247200302:173"/>
"But waſte no more time," he added
to his followers, and pointing to Ellena,
"away with her."</p>
            <p>As he ſaid this, they lifted Ellena in
their arms. "Let me looſe!" cried Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,
when he ſaw they were carrying her
from the place, "let me looſe, I ſay!" and
the violence of his ſtruggles burſt aſunder
the cords which held him; a vain releaſe,
for he was inſtantly ſeized again.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, already exhauſted by the loſs
of blood and the anguiſh of his mind,
made, however, a laſt effort to ſave her;
he tried to raiſe himſelf from the ground,
but a ſudden film came over his ſight, and
his ſenſes forſook him, while yet the name
of Ellena faultered on his lips.</p>
            <p>As they bore her from the chapel,
ſhe continued to call upon Vivaldi, and
alternately co ſupplicate that ſhe might
once more behold him, and take one laſt
adieu. The ruffians were inexorable, and
ſhe heard his voice no more, for he no
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0247200302:174"/>
longer heard—no longer was able to reply
to her's.</p>
            <p>"O! once again!" ſhe cried in agony,
"One word, Vivaldi! Let me hear the
ſound of your voice yet once again!"
But it was ſilent.</p>
            <p>As ſhe quitted the chapel, with eyes
ſtill bent towards the ſpot where he lay,
ſhe exclaimed, in the piercing accents of
deſpair, "Farewell, Vivaldi!—O! for ever
—ever, farewel!"</p>
            <p>The tone, in which ſhe pronounced the
laſt "farewel!" was ſo touching, that even
the cold heart of the prieſt could not reſiſt
it; but he impatiently wiped away the few
tears, that ruſhed into his eyes, before they
were obſerved. Vivaldi heard it—it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to arouſe him from death!—he heard
her mournful voice for the laſt time, and,
turning his eyes, ſaw her veil floating away
through the portal of the chapel. All
ſuffering, all effort, all reſiſtance were vain;
the ruffians bound him, bleeding as he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0247200302:175"/>
was, and conveyed him to the Benedictine
convent, together with the wounded Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,
who unceaſingly vociferated on the way
thither, "I demand to be ſent to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſion!
I demand to be ſent to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition!"</p>

            <p>THE wounds of Vivaldi, and of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
were pronounced, by the Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
who had examined and dreſſed them,
to be not dangerous, but thoſe of one of
the ruffians were declared doubtful. Some
few of the brothers diſplayed much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
and kindneſs towards the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0247200302:176"/>
but the greater part ſeemed fearful of
expreſſing any degree of ſympathy for
perſons who had fallen within the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the Holy Office, and even kept
aloof from the chamber, in which they were
confined. To this ſelf-reſtriction, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they were not long ſubjected; for
Vivaldi and Paulo were compelled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
their journey as ſoon as ſome ſhort reſt
had ſufficiently revived them. They were
placed in the ſame carriage, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of two officers prevented all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of conjecture as to the deſtination
of Ellena, and with reſpect to the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
occaſion of their misfortune. Paulo,
indeed, now and then hazarded a ſurmiſe,
and did not ſcruple to affirm, that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs
of San Stefano was their chief enemy;
that the Carmelite friars, who had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
them on the road, were her agents;
and that, having traced their route, they
had given intelligence where Vivaldi and
Ellena might be found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0247200302:177"/>
"I gueſſed we never ſhould eſcape the
Abbeſs," ſaid Paulo, "though I would not
diſturb you, Signor mio, nor the poor lady
Ellena, by ſaying ſo. But your Abbeſſes
are as cunning as Inquiſitors, and are ſo
fond of governing, that they had rather,
like them, ſend a man to the devil, than
ſend him no where."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi gave Paulo a ſignificant look,
which was meant to repreſs his imprudent
loquacity, and then ſunk again into ſilence
and the abſtractions of deep grief. The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
mean while, never ſpoke, but were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant
of all that Paulo ſaid, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their watchfulneſs, but becauſe he
deſpiſed them as ſpies, he thoughtleſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
them alſo as enemies, and was ſo far"
from concealing opinions, which they
might repeat to his prejudice, that he had
a pride in exaggerating them, and in dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the worſt, which the exaſperated tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of theſe men, ſhut up in the ſame
carriage with him, and compelled to hear
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0247200302:178"/>
whatever he choſe to ſay againſt the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
to which they belonged, could
effect. Whenever Vivaldi, recalled from
his abſtractions by ſome bold aſſertion,
endeavoured to check his imprudence,
Paulo was contented to ſolace his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
inſtead of protecting himſelf, by
ſaying, "It is their own fault; they would
thruſt themſelves into my company; let
them have enough of it; and, if ever they
take me before their reverences, the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors,
<hi>they</hi> ſhall have enough for it too.
I will play up ſuch a tune in the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as is not heard there every day.
I will jingle all the bells on their fool's
caps, and tell them a little honeſt truth, if
they make me ſmart for it ever ſo."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, arouſed once more, and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alarmed for the conſequences which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Paulo might be drawing upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
now inſiſted on his ſilence, and was
obeyed.</p>
            <p>They travelled during the whole night,
ſtopping only to change horſes. At
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0247200302:179"/>
every poſt houſe, Vivaldi looked for a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
that might incloſe Ellena, but none
appeared, nor any ſound of wheels told
him that ſhe followed.</p>
            <p>With the morning light he perceived
the dome of St. Peter, appearing faintly
over the plains that ſurrounded Rome, and
he underſtood, for the firſt time, that he
was going to the priſons of the Inquiſition
in that city. The travellers deſcended
upon the Campania, and then reſted for
a few hours at a ſmall town on its borders.</p>
            <p>When they again ſet forward, Vivaldi
perceived that the guard was changed, the
officer who had remained with him in the
apartment of the inn only appearing
among the new faces which ſurrounded
him. The dreſs and manners of theſe men
differed conſiderably from thoſe of the
other. Their conduct was more temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
but their countenances expreſſed a
darker cruelty, mingled with a ſly demure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and a ſolemn ſelf-importance, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
them at once as belonging to the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0247200302:180"/>
Inquiſition. They were almoſt invariably
ſilent; and when they did ſpeak, it was
only in a few ſententious words. To the
abounding queſtions of Paulo, and the few
earneſt entreaties of his maſter, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the place of Ellena's deſtination,
they made not the leaſt reply; and liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all the flouriſhing ſpeeches of the
ſervant againſt Inquiſitors and the Holy
Office with the moſt profound gravity.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi was ſtruck with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the guard being changed, and
ſtill more with the appearance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who now compoſed it. When he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the manners of the late, with thoſe
of the preſent guard, he thought he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the firſt the mere ferocity of ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians;
but in the latter, the principles of
cunning and cruelty, which ſeemed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to characterize Inquiſitors; he was
inclined to believe, that a ſtratagem had
enthralled him, and that now, for the firſt
time, he was in the cuſtody of the <hi>Holy
Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0247200302:181"/>
It was near midnight when the priſoners
entered the <hi>Porto del Popolo,</hi> and found
themſelves in the midſt of the Carnival at
Rome. The <hi>Corſo,</hi> through which they
were obliged to paſs, was crowded with gay
carriages and maſks, with proceſſions of
muſicians, monks, and mountebanks, was
lighted up with innumerable flambeaux,
and reſounded with the heterogeneous
rattling of wheels, the muſic of ſerenaders,
and the jokes and laughter of the revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
as they ſportively threw about their
ſugar-plumbs. The heat of the weather
made it neceſſary to have the windows of
the coach open; and the priſoners, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſaw all that paſſed without. It was
a ſcene, which contraſted cruelly with the
feelings and circumſtances of Vivaldi;
torn as he was from her he moſt loved, in
dreadful uncertainty as to her fate, and
himſelf about to be brought before a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
whoſe myſterious and terrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
appalled even the braveſt ſpirits.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0247200302:182"/>
Altogether, this was one of the moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
examples, which the chequer-work of
human life could ſhew, or human feelings
endure, Vivaldi ſickened as he looked upon
the ſplendid crowd, while the carriage
made its way ſlowly with it; but Paulo,
as he gazed, was reminded of the Corſo of
Naples, ſuch as it appeared at the time of
Carnival, and, comparing the preſent ſcene
with his native one, he found fault with
every thing he beheld. The dreſſes were
taſteleſſ, the equipages without ſplendor,
the people without ſpirit; yet, ſuch was
the propenſity of his heart to ſympathize
with whatever was gay, that, for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he forgot that he was a priſoner on
his way to the Inquiſition; almoſt forgot
that he was a Neapolitan; and, while he
exclaimed againſt the dullneſs of a Roman
carnival, would have ſprung through the
carriage window to partake of its ſpirit, if
his fetters and his wounds had not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him. A deep ſigh from Vivaldi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0247200302:183"/>
his wandering imagination; and,
when he noticed again the ſorrow in his
maſter's look, all his lightly joyous ſpirits
fled.</p>
            <p>"My <hi>maeſtro,</hi> my dear <hi>maeſtro!"</hi>—he
ſaid, and knew not how to finiſh what he
wiſhed to expreſs.</p>
            <p>At that moment they paſſed the theatre
of San Carlo, the doors of which were
thronged with equipages, where Roman
ladies, in their gala habits, courtiers in
their fantaſtic dreſſes, and maſks of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
were haſtening to the opera. In
the midſt of this gay buſtle, where the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was unable to proceed, the officials
of the Inquiſition looked on in ſolemn
ſilence, not a muſcle of their features re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing
in ſympathy, or yielding a ſingle
wrinkle of the ſelf-importance that lifted
their brows; and, while they regarded
with ſecret contempt thoſe, who could be
thus lightly pleaſed, the people, in return,
more wiſely, perhaps, regarded with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0247200302:184"/>
the proud moroſeneſs, that refuſed
to partake of innocent pleaſures, becauſe
they were trifling, and ſhrunk from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
ſurrowed with the ſternneſs of
cruelty. But, when their office was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed,
part of the crowd preſſed back
from the carriage in affright, while ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part advanced with curioſity; though,
as the majority retreated, ſpace was left
for the carriage to move on. After quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Corſo, it proceeded for ſome
miles through dark and deſerted ſtreets,
where only here and there a lamp, hung on
high before the image of a ſaint, ſhed it's
glimmering light, and where a melancholy
and univerſal ſilence prevailed. At inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
indeed, the moon, as the clouds paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
away, ſhewed, for a moment, ſome of
thoſe mighty monuments of Rome's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
name, thoſe ſacred ruins, thoſe gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
ſkeletons, which once encloſed a ſoul,
whoſe energies governed a world! Even Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi
could not behold with indifference the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0247200302:185"/>
grandeur of theſe reliques, as the rays fell
upon the hoary walls and columns, or
paſs among theſe ſcenes of ancient ſtory,
without feeling a melancholy awe, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
enthuſiaſm, that withdrew him from
himſelf. But the illuſion was tranſient;
his own misfortunes preſſed too heavily
upon him to be long unfelt, and his eh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm
vaniſhed like the moonlight.</p>
            <p>A returning gleam lighted up, ſoon after,
the rude and extenſive area, which the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was croſſing. It appeared, from it's
deſolation, and the ruins ſcattered diſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
along its ſkirts, to be a part of the city
entirely abandoned by the modern inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
to the reliques of its former grandeur.
Not even the ſhadow of a human being
croſſed the waſte, nor any building appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which might be ſuppoſed to ſhelter
one. The deep tone of a bell, however,
rolling on the ſilence of the night, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the haunts of man to be not far
off; and Vivaldi perceived in the diſtance,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0247200302:186"/>
to which he was approaching, an extent of
lofty walls and towers, that, as far as the
gloom would permit his eye to penetrate,
bounded the horizon. He judged theſe
to be the priſons of the Inquiſition. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
pointed them out at the ſame moment.
"Ah, Signor!" ſaid he deſpondingly; "that
is the place! what ſtrength! If, my Lord,
the Marcheſe were but to ſee where we
are going! Ah!"—</p>
            <p>He concluded with a deep ſigh, and
ſunk again into the ſtate of apprehenſion
and mute expectation, which he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
from the moment that he quitted the
Corſo.</p>
            <p>The carriage having reached the walls,
followed their bendings to a conſiderable
extent. Theſe walls, of immenſe height,
and ſtrengthened by innumerable maſſy
bulwarks, exhibited neither window or
grate, but a vaſt and dreary blank; a
ſmall round tower only, perched here and
there upon the ſummit, breaking their
monotony.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0247200302:187"/>
The priſoners paſſed what ſeemed to be
the principal entrance, from, the grandeur
of its portal, and the gigantic loftineſs of
the towers that roſe over it; and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the carriage ſtopped at an arch-way in
the walls, ſtrongly barricadoed. One of
the eſcort alighted, and, having ſtruck up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the bars, a folding door within was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
opened, and a man bearing a
torch appeared behind the barricado,
whoſe countenance, as he looked through
it, might have been copied for the
"Grim-viſaged comfortleſs Deſpair"
of the Poet.</p>
            <p>No words were exchanged between him
and the guard; but on perceiving who
were without, he opened the iron gate,
and the priſoners, having alighted, paſſed
with the two officials beneath the arch,
the guard following with a torch. They
deſcended a flight of broad ſteps, at the
foot of which another iron gate admitted
them to a kind of hall; ſuch, however, it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0247200302:188"/>
at firſt appeared to Vivaldi, as his eyes
glanced through its gloomy extent, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly
aſcertaining it by the lamp, which
hung from the centre of the roof. No
perſon appeared, and a death-like ſilence
prevailed; for neither the officials nor the
guard yet ſpoke; nor did any diſtant
found contradict the notion, that they were
traverſing the chambers of the dead. To
Vivaldi it occurred, that this was one of
the burial vaults of the victims, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the Inquiſition, and his whole
frame thrilled with horror. Several ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
opening from the apartment, ſeemed
to lead to diſtant quarters of this immenſe
fabric, but ſtill no footſtep whiſpering
along the pavement, or voice murmuring
through the arched roofs, indicated it to
be the reſidence of the living.</p>
            <p>Having entered one of the paſſages,
Vivaldi perceived a perſon clothed in black,
and who bore a lighted taper, croſſing ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
in the remote perſpective; and he
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0247200302:189"/>
underſtood too well from his habit, that
he was a member of this dreadful tribunal.</p>
            <p>The found of footſteps ſeemed to reach
the ſtranger, for he turned, and then
pauſed, while the officers advanced. They
then made ſigns to each other, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
a few words, which neither Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi
or his ſervant could underſtand,
when the ſtranger, pointing with his taper
along another avenue, paſſed away. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi
followed him with his eyes, till a door
at the extremity of the paſſage opened,
and he ſaw the Inquiſitor enter an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whence a great light proceeded, and
where ſeveral other figures, habited like
himſelf, appeared waiting to receive him.
The door immediately cloſed; and, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the imagination of Vivaldi was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
or that the ſounds were real, he
thought, as it cloſed, he diſtinguiſhed
half-ſtifled groans, as of a perſon in agony.</p>
            <p>The avenue, through which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
paſſed, opened, at length, into an
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0247200302:190"/>
ment gloomy like the firſt they had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but more extenſive. The roof was
ſupported by arches, and long arcades
branched off from every ſide of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as from a central point, and were loſt
in the gloom, which the rays of the ſmall
lamps, ſuſpended in each, but feebly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated.</p>
            <p>They reſted here, and a perſon ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
advanced, who appeared to be the jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
into whoſe hands Vivaldi and Paulo
were delivered. A few myſterious words
having been exchanged, one of the officials
croſſed the hall, and aſcended a wide ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
while the other, with the jailor and
the guard, remained below, as if awaiting
his return.</p>
            <p>A long interval elapſed, during which
the ſtillneſs of the place was ſometimes
interrupted by a cloſing door, and, at
others, by indiſtinct ſounds, which yet
appeared to Vivaldi like lamentations and
extorted groans. Inquiſitors, in their long
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0247200302:191"/>
black robes, iſſued, from time, to time from
the paſſages, and croſſed the hall to other
avenues. They eyed the priſoners with
curioſity, but without pity. Their viſages,
with few exceptions, ſeemed ſtamped with
the characters of demons. Vivaldi could
not look upon the grave cruelty, or the
ferocious impatience, their countenances
ſeverally expreſſed, without reading in
them the fate of ſome fellow creature,
the fate, which theſe men ſeemed going,
even at this moment, to confirm; and, as
they paſſed with ſoundleſs ſteps, he ſhrunk
from obſervation, as if their very looks
poſſeſſed ſome ſupernatural power, and
could have ſtruck death. But he followed
their fleeting figures, as they proceeded on
their work of horror, to where the laſt
glimmering ray faded into darkneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
to ſee other doors of other cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
open to receive them. While medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
upon theſe horrors, Vivaldi loſt
every ſelfiſh conſideration in aſtoniſhment
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0247200302:192"/>
and indignation of the ſufferings, which
the frenzied wickedneſs of man prepares
for man, who, even at the moment of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
inſults his victim with aſſertions of
the juſtice and neceſſity of ſuch procedure.
"Is this poſſible!" ſaid Vivaldi internally,
"Can this be in human nature!—Can
ſuch horrible perverſion of right be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted!
Can man, who calls himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with reaſon, and immeaſurably ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to every other created being, argue
himſelf into the commiſſion of ſuch horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
folly, ſuch inveterate cruelty, as exceeds
all the acts of the moſt irrational and fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
brute. Brutes do not deliberately
ſlaughter their ſpecies; it remains for man
only, man, proud of his prerogative of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and boaſting of his ſenſe of juſtice,
to unite the moſt terrible extremes of folly
and wickedneſs!"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi had been no ſtranger to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of this tribunal; he had long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the nature of the eſtabliſhment,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0247200302:193"/>
and had often received particular accounts
of its cuſtoms and laws; but, though he
had believed before, it was now only that
conviction appeared to impreſe his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
A new view of human nature
ſeemed to burſt, at once, upon his mind,
and he could not have experienced greater
aſtoniſhment, if this had been the firſt
moment, in which he had heard of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
But, when he thought of Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
conſidered that ſhe was in the power
of this tribunal, and that it was probable
ſhe was at this moment within the ſame
dreadful walls, grief, indignation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
irritated him almoſt to frenzy. He
ſeemed ſuddenly animated with ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſtrength, and ready to attempt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities
for her deliverance. It was by
a ſtrong effort for ſelf command, that he
forbore burſting the bonds, which held
him, and making a deſperate attempt to
ſeek her through the vaſt extent of theſe
priſons. Reflection, however, had not ſo
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0247200302:194"/>
entirely forſaken him, but that he ſaw the
impoſſibility of ſucceeding in ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
the moment he had conceived it, and
he forbore to ruſh upon the certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
to which it muſt have led. His
paſſions, thus reſtrained, ſeemed to become
virtues, and to diſplay themſelves in the
energy of his courage and his fortitude.
His ſoul became ſtern and vigorous in
deſpair, and his manner and countenance
aſſumed a calm dignity, which ſeemed to
awe, in ſome degree, even his guards. The
pain of his wounds was no longer felt; it
appeared as if the ſtrength of his intellect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ſelf had ſubdued the infirmities of
the body, and, perhaps, in theſe moments
of elevation, he could have endured the
torture without ſhrinking.</p>
            <p>Paulo, meanwhile, mute and grave, was
watchful of all that paſſed; he obſerved
the revolutions in his maſter's mind, with
grief firſt, and then with ſurprize, but he
could not imitate the noble fortitude, which
now gave weight and ſteadineſs to Vivaldi's
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0247200302:195"/>
thoughts. And when he looked on the
power and gloom around him, and on the
viſages of the paſſing Inquiſitors, he began
to repent, that he had ſo freely delivered
his opinion of this tribunal, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of its agents, and to perceive, that
if he played up the kind of tune he had
threatened, it would probably be the laſt
he ſhould ever be permitted to perform in
this world.</p>
            <p>At length, the chief officer deſcended the
ſtair-caſe, and immediately bade Vivaldi
follow him. Paulo was accompanying
his maſter, but was withheld by the guard,
and told he was to be diſpoſed of in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
way. This was the moment of his
ſevereſt trial; he declared he would not
be ſeparated from his maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>"What did I demand to be brought
here for," he cried, "if it was not that I
might go ſhares with the Signor in all his
troubles? This is not a place to come to
for pleaſure, I warrant; and I can promiſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0247200302:196"/>
ye, gentlemen, I would not have come
within an hundred miles of you, if it had
not been for my maſter's ſake."</p>
            <p>The guards roughly interrupted him,
and were carrying him away, when Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di's
commanding voice arreſted them.
He returned to ſpeak a few words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
to his faithful ſervant, and, ſince
they were to be ſeparated, to take leave of
him.</p>
            <p>Paulo embraced his knees, and, while
he wept, and his words were almoſt ſtifled
by ſobs, declared no force ſhould drag
him from his maſter, while he had life;
and repeatedly appealed to the guards,
with—"What did I demand to be
brought here for? Did ever any body
come here to ſeek pleaſure? What right
have you to prevent my going ſhares with
my maſter in his troubles?"</p>
            <p>"We do not intend to deny you that
pleaſure, friend," replied one of the guards!</p>
            <p>"Don't you? Then heaven bleſs you!"
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0247200302:197"/>
cried Paulo, ſpringing From his knees, and
ſhaking the man by the hand with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that would nearly have diſlocated
the ſhoulder of a perſon leſs robuſt.</p>
            <p>"So come with us," added the guard,
drawing him away from Vivaldi. Paulo
now became outrageous, and, ſtruggling
with the guards, burſt from them, and
again fell at the feet of his maſter, who
raiſed and embraced him, endeavouring
to prevail with him to ſubmit quietly to
what was inevitable, and to encourage him
with hope.</p>
            <p>"I truſt that our ſeparation will be
ſhort" ſaid Vivaldi, "and that we ſhall
meet in happier circumſtances. My
innocence muſt ſoon appear."</p>
            <p>"We ſhall never, never meet again,
Signormio, in this world," ſaid Paulo, ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
violently, "ſo don't make me hope
ſo. That old Abbeſs knows what ſhe is
about too well to let us eſcape; or ſhe
would not have catched us up ſo cunningly
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0247200302:198"/>
as ſhe did; ſo what ſignifies innocence!
O! if my old lord, the Marcheſe, did but
know where we are!"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi interrupted him, and turning to
the guards ſaid, "I recommend my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſervant to your compaſſion; he is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
It will ſome time, perhaps, be in
my power to recompence you for any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
you may allow him, and I ſhall
value it a thouſand times more highly,
than any you could ſhew to myſelf! Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
Paulo,—farewel! Officer, I am
ready."</p>
            <p>"O ſtay! Signor, for one moment—ſtay!"
ſaid Paulo.</p>
            <p>"We can wait no longer," ſaid the
guard, and again drew Paulo away, who
looking piteouſly after Vivaldi, alternately
repeated, Farewel, dear maeſtro! farewel
dear, dear maeſtro!" and "What did I
demand to be brought here for? What
did I demand to be brought here for?—what
was it for, if not to go ſhares with my
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0247200302:199"/>
maeſtro?" till Vivaldi was beyond the
reach of ſight and of hearing.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, having followed the officer up
the ſtair-caſe, paſſed through a gallery to
an anti-chamber, where, being delivered
into the cuſtody of ſome perſons in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his conductor diſappeared beyond a
folding door, that led to an inner apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Over this door was an inſcription in
Hebrew characters, traced in blood-colour.
Dante's inſcription on the entrance of the
infernal regions, would have been ſuitable to
a place, where every circumſtance and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſeemed to ſay, "<hi>Hope, that comes to
all, comes not here!".</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vivaldi conjectured, that in this cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
they were preparing for him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
which were to extort a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion;
and though he knew little of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
proceedings of this tribunal, he had
always underſtood, that the torture was
inflicted upon the accuſed perſon, till he
made confeſſion of the crime, of which he
was ſuſpected. By ſuch a mode of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0247200302:200"/>
the innocent were certain of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
longer than the guilty; for, as they
had nothing to confeſs, the Inquiſitor,
miſtaking innocence for obſtinacy, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in his inflictions, and it frequently
happened that he compelled the innocent
to become criminal, and aſſert a falſehood,
that they might be releaſed from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
which they could no longer ſuſtain.
Vivaldi conſidered this circumſtance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly;
every faculty of his ſoul was
bent up to firmneſs and endurance. He
believed that he underſtood the extent of
the charge, which would be brought
againſt him, a charge as falſe, as a ſpecious
confirmation of it, would be terrible in it's
conſequence both to Ellena and himſelf.
Yet every art would be practiſed to bring
him to an acknowledgment of having car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off a nun, and he knew alſo, that,
ſince the proſecutor and the witneſſes are
never confronted with the priſoner in caſes
of ſevere accuſation, and ſince their very
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0247200302:201"/>
names are concealed from him, it would
be ſcarcely poſſible for him to prove his
innocence. But he did not heſitate an
inſtant whether to ſacrifice himſelf for
Ellena, determining rather to expire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the mercileſs inflictions of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors,
than to aſſert a falſehood, which
muſt involve her in deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The officer, at length, appeared, and,
having beckoned Vivaldi to advance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his head, and bared his arms. He
then led him forward through the folding
door into the chamber; having done
which, he immediately withdrew, and the
door, which ſhut out Hope, cloſed after
him.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi found himſelf in a ſpacious
apartment, where only two perſons were
viſible, who were ſeated at a large table,
that occupied the centre of the room.
They were both habited in black; the one,
who ſeemed by his piercing eye, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
phyſiognomy, to be an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0247200302:202"/>
wore on his head a kind of black
turban, which heightened the natural fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity
of his viſage; the other was unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and his arms bared to the elbows.
A book, with ſome inſtruments of ſingular
appearance, lay before him. Round the
table were ſeveral unoccupied chairs, on
the backs of which appeared figurative
ſigns, at the upper end of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a gigantic crucifix ſtretched nearly
to the vaulted roof; and, at the lower end,
ſuſpended from an arch in the wall, was a
dark curtain, but whether it veiled a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
or ſhrowded ſome object or perſon,
neceſſary to the deſigns of the Inquiſitor,
there were little means of judging. It was,
however, ſuſpended from an arch ſuch as
ſometimes contains a caſement, or leads to
a deep receſs.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitor called on Vivaldi to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and, when he had reached the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
put a book into his hands, and bade
him ſwear to reveal the truth, and keep
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0247200302:203"/>
for ever ſecret whatever he might ſee or
hear in the apartment.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi heſitated to obey ſo unqualified
a command. The Inquiſitor reminded
him, by a look, not to be miſtaken, that
he was abſolute here; but Vivaldi ſtill he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated.
"Shall I conſent to my own
condemnation?" ſaid he to himſelf, "The
malice of demons like theſe may convert
the moſt innocent circumſtances into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of accuſation, for my deſtruction, and
I muſt anſwer whatever queſtions they
chooſe to aſk. And ſhall I ſwear, alſo, to
conceal whatever I may witneſs in this
chamber, when I know that the moſt dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
cruelties are hourly practiſed here?"</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitor, in a voice which would
have made a heart leſs fortified than was
Vivaldi's tremble, again commanded him
to ſwear; at the ſame time, he made a
ſignal to the perſon, who ſat at the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
end of the table, and who appeared to
be an inferior officer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0247200302:204"/>
Vivaldi was ſtill ſilent, but, he began to
conſider that, unconſcious as he was of
crime, it was ſcarcely poſſible for his words
to be tortured into a ſelf-accuſation; and
that, whatever he might witneſs, no retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
would be prevented, no evil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by the oath, which bound him to
ſecreſy, ſince his moſt ſevere denunciation
could avail nothing againſt the ſupreme
power of this tribunal. As he did not
perceive any good, which could ariſe from
refuſing the oath; and ſaw much imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
evil from reſiſtance, he conſented to
receive it. Notwithſtanding this, when
he put the book to his lips, and uttered
the tremendous vow preſcribed to him,
heſitation and reluctance returned upon
his mind, and an icy coldneſs ſtruck to his
heart. He was ſo much affected, that
circumſtances, apparently the moſt trivial,
had at this moment influence upon his
imagination. As he accidentally threw
his eyes upon the curtain, which he had
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0247200302:205"/>
obſerved before without emotion, and
now thought it moved, he almoſt ſtarted
in expectation of ſeeing ſome perſon, an
Inquiſitor perhaps, as terrific as the one
before him, or an Accuſer as malicious as
Schedoni, ſteal from behind it.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitor having adminiſtered the
oath, and the attendant having noted it in
his book, the examination began. After
demanding, as is uſual, the names and
titles of Vivaldi and his family, and his
place of reſidence, to which he fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
the Inquiſitor aſked, whether he
underſtood the nature of the accuſation
on which he had been arreſted.</p>
            <p>"The order for my arreſtation informed
me." replied Vivaldi.</p>
            <p>"Look to your words!" ſaid the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor,
"and remember your oath. What
was the ground of accuſation?"</p>
            <p>"I underſtood," ſaid Vivaldi, "that I
was accuſed of having ſtolen a nun from
her ſanctuary."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0247200302:206"/>
A faint degree of ſurpriſe appeared on
the brow of the Inquiſitor. "You confeſs
it, then?" he ſaid, after the pauſe of a
moment, and making a ſignal to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,
who immediately noted Vivaldi's
words.</p>
            <p>"I ſolemnly deny it," replied Vivaldi,
"the accuſation is falſe and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious."</p>
            <p>"Remember the oath you have taken!"
repeated the Inquiſitor, "learn alſo, that
mercy is ſhewn to ſuch as make full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
but that the torture is applied to
thoſe, who have the folly and the obſtinacy
to withhold the truth."</p>
            <p>"If you torture me till I acknowledge
the juſtneſs of this accuſation," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi,
"I muſt expire under your inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for ſuffering never ſhall compel me
to aſſert a falſehood. It is not the truth,
which you ſeek; it is not the guilty, whom
you puniſh; the innocent, having no
crimes to confeſs, are the victims of your
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0247200302:207"/>
cruelty, or, to eſcape from it, become cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
and proclam a lie."</p>
            <p>"Recollect yourſelf," ſaid the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
ſternly. "You are not brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to accuſe, but to anſwer accuſation.
You ſay you are innocent; yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
yourſelf to be acquainted with
the ſubject of the charge which is to be
urged againſt you! How could you
know this, but from the voice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?"</p>
            <p>"From the words of your own ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,"
replied Vivaldi, "and from thoſe
of your officials who arreſted me."</p>
            <p>"How!" exclaimed the Inquiſitor,
"note that," pointing to the Secretary;
"he ſays by the words of our ſummons;
now we know, that you never read that
ſummons. He ſays alſo by the words of
our officials;—it appears, then, he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that death would follow ſuch a breach
of confidence."</p>
            <p>"It is true, I never did read the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,"
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0247200302:208"/>
replied Vivaldi, "and as true, that
I never aſſerted I did; the friar, who read
it, told of what it accuſed me, and your
officials confirmed the teſtimony."</p>
            <p>"No more of this equivocation!" ſaid
the Inquiſitor, "Speak only to the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
            <p>"I will not ſuffer my aſſertions to be
miſrepreſented," replied Vivaldi, "or my
words to be perverted againſt myſelf. I
have ſworn to ſpeak the truth only; ſince
you believe I violate my oath, and doubt
my direct and ſimple words, I will ſpeak
no more."</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitor half roſe from his chair,
and his countenance grew paler. "Auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heretic!" he ſaid, "will you diſpute,
inſult, and diſobey, the commands of our
moſt holy tribunal! You will be taught
the conſequence of your deſperate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.
—To the torture with him!"</p>
            <p>A ſtern ſmile was on the features of
Vivaldi, his eyes were calmly fixed on the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0247200302:209"/>
Inquiſitor, and his attitude was undaunted
and firm. His courage, and the cool
contempt, which his looks expreſſed,
ſeemed to touch his examiner, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that he had not a common mind to
operate upon. He abandoned, therefore,
for the preſent, terrific meaſures, and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
his uſual manner, proceeded in the
examination.</p>
            <p>"Where were you arreſted?"</p>
            <p>"At the chapel of San Sebaſtian, on the
lake of Celano."</p>
            <p>"You are certain as to this?" aſked
the Inquiſitor, "you are ſure it was not
at the village of Legano, on the high road
between Celano and Rome?"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, while he confirmed his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
recollected with ſome ſurprize that
Legano was the place where the guard
had been changed, and he mentioned the
circumſtance. The Inquiſitor, however,
proceeded in his queſtions, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to notice it. "Was any perſon
arreſted with you?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0247200302:210"/>
"You cannot be ignorant," replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi,
"that Signora di Roſalba, was
ſeized at the ſame time, upon the falſe
charge of being a nun, who had broken
her vows, and eloped from her convent;
nor that Paulo Mendrico, my faithful
ſervant! was alſo made a priſoner, though
upon what pretence he was arreſted I am
utterly ignorant."</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitor remained for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in thoughtful ſilence, and then
enquired ſlightly concerning the family of
Ellena, and her uſual place of reſidence.
Vivaldi, fearful of making ſome aſſertion
that might be prejudicial to her, referred
him to herſelf; but the inquiry was
repeated.</p>
            <p>"She is now within theſe walls," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Vivaldi, hoping to learn from the
manner of his examiner, whether his fears
were juſt, "and can anſwer theſe queſtions
better than myſelf."</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitor merely bade the Notary
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0247200302:211"/>
write down her name, and then remained
for a few moments meditating. At length,
he ſaid, "Do you know where you now
are?"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, ſmiling the queſtion, replied,
"I underſtand that I am in the priſons of
the Inquiſition, at Rome."</p>
            <p>"Do you know what are the crimes
that ſubject perſons to the cognizance of
the Holy Office?"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi was ſilent.</p>
            <p>"Your conſcience informs <hi>you,</hi> and your
ſilence confirms <hi>me.</hi> Let me admoniſh
you, once more, to make a full confeſſion
of your guilt; remember that this is a
merciful tribunal, and ſhews favour to
ſuch as acknowledge their crimes?"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi ſmiled; but the Inquiſitor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>"It does not reſemble ſome ſevere, yet
juſt courts, where immediate execution
follows the confeſſion of a criminal. No!
it is merciful, and though it puniſhes
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0247200302:212"/>
guilt, it never applies the torture but in
caſes of neceſſity, when the obſtinate ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the priſoner requires ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
You ſee, therefore, what you may
avoid, and what expect."</p>
            <p>"But if the priſoner has nothing to
confeſs?" ſaid Vivaldi,—"Can your tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
make him guilty? They may force
a weak mind to be guilty of falſehood;
to eſcape preſent anguiſh, a man may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
condemn himſelf to the death!
You will find that I am not ſuch an one."</p>
            <p>"Young man," replied the Inquiſitor,
"you will underſtand too ſoon, that we
never act, but upon ſure authority; and
will wiſh, too late, that you had made an
honeſt confeſſion. Your ſilence cannot
keep from us a knowledge of your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences;
we are in poſſeſſion of facts; and
your obſtinacy can neither wreſt from us
the truth, or pervert it. Your moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
offences are already written on the
tablets of the Holy Office; your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0247200302:213"/>
cannot reflect them more juſtly.—Tremble,
therefore, and revere. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that, though we have ſufficient
proof of your guilt, we require you to
confeſs; and that the puniſhment of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
is as certain, as that of any other
offence."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi made no reply, and the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
after a momentary ſilence, added,
"Was you ever in the church of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito
Santo, at Naples?"</p>
            <p>"Before I anſwer the queſtion," ſaid
Vivaldi, "I require the name of my
accuſer."</p>
            <p>"You are to recollect that you have no
right to demand any thing in this place,"
obſerved the Inquiſitor, "nor can you be
ignorant that the name of the Informer is
always kept ſacred from the knowledge of
the Accuſed. Who would venture to do
his duty, if his name was arbitrarily to be
expoſed to the vengeance of the criminal
againſt whom he informs? It is only in a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0247200302:214"/>
particular proceſs that the Accuſer is
brought forward,"</p>
            <p>"The names of the Witneſſes?" demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Vivaldi. The ſame juſtice conceals them
alſo from the knowledge of the Accuſed,
replied the Inquiſitor.</p>
            <p>"And is no juſtice left for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed?"
ſaid Vivaldi. "Is he to be tried
and condemned without being confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with either his Proſecutor, or the
Witneſſes!"</p>
            <p>"Your queſtions are too many," ſaid
the Inquiſitor, and your anſwers too few.
The Informer is not alſo the Proſecutor;
the Holy Office, before which the inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is laid, is the Proſecutor, and the
diſpenſer of juſtice; its Public Accuſer
lays the circumſtances, and the teſtimonies
of the Witneſſes, before the Court. But
too much of this."</p>
            <p>"How!" exclaimed Vivaldi, "is the
tribunal at once the Proſecutor, Witneſs,
and Judge! What can private malice
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0247200302:215"/>
wiſh for more, than ſuch a court of <hi>juſtice,</hi>
at which to arraign it's enemy? The
ſtiletto of the Aſſaſſin is not ſo ſure, or
ſo fatal to innocence. I now perceive,
that it avails me nothing to be guiltleſs;
a ſingle enemy is ſufficient to accompliſh
my deſtruction."</p>
            <p>"You have an enemy then?" obſerved
the Inquiſitor.</p>
            <p>Vivaldi was too well convinced that he
had one, but there was not ſufficient proof,
as to the perſon of this enemy, to juſtify,
him in aſſerting that it was Schedoni.
The circumſtance of Ellena having been
arreſted, would have compelled him to
ſuſpect another perſon as being at leaſt
acceſſary to the deſigns of the Confeſſor,
had not credulity ſtarted in horror from
the ſuppoſition, that a mother's reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could poſſibly betray her ſon into
the priſons of the Inquiſition, though this
mother had exhibited a temper of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſeleſs
cruelty towards a ſtranger, who
had interrupted her views for that ſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0247200302:216"/>
"You have an enemy then?" repeated
the Inquiſitor.</p>
            <p>"That I am here ſufficiently proves it,"
replied Vivaldi. "But I am ſo little any
man's enemy, that I know not who to call
mine."</p>
            <p>"It is evident, then, that you have no
enemy," obſerved the ſubtle Inquiſitor,
"and that this accuſation is brought
againſt you by a reſpecter of truth, and
a faithful ſervant of the Roman intereſt."</p>
            <p>Vivaldi was ſhocked to perceive the
inſidious art, by which he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
into a declaration apparently ſo
harmleſs, and the cruel dexterity with
which it had been turned againſt him. A
lofty and contemptuous ſilence was all
that he oppoſed to the treachery of his
examiner, on whoſe countenance appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſmile of triumph and ſelf-congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the life of a fellow creature being, in
his eſtimation, of no comparative impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the ſelf-applauſes of ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0247200302:217"/>
art; the art, too, upon which he moſt
valued himſelf—that of his profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitor proceeded, "You per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
then, in withholding the truth?"
He pauſed, but Vivaldi making no reply,
he reſumed.</p>
            <p>"Since it is evident, from your own
declaration, that you have no enemy,
whom private reſentment might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated
to accuſe you; and, from other
circumſtances which have occurred in
your conduct, that you are conſcious of
more than you have confeſſed,—it appears,
that the accuſation which has been urged
againſt you, is not a malicious ſlander. I
exhort you, therefore, and once more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you, by our holy faith, to make an
ingenuous confeſſion of your offences, and
to fare yourſelf from the means, which
muſt of neceſſity be enforced to obtain a
confeſſion before your trial commences.
I adjure you, alſo, to conſider, that by
ſuch open conduct only, can mercy be
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0247200302:218"/>
won to ſoften the juſtice of this moſt
righteous tribunal!"</p>
            <p>Vivaldi, perceiving that it was now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for him to reply, once more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
aſſerted his innocence of the crime
alledged againſt him in the ſummons, and
of the conſciouſneſs of any act, which
might lawfully ſubject him to the notice
of the Holy Office.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitor again demanded what
was the crime alledged, and, Vivaldi having
repeated the accuſation, he again bade the
Secretary note it, as he did which, Vivaldi
thought he perceived upon his features
ſomething of a malignant ſatisfaction, for
which he knew not how to account.
When the Secretary had finiſhed, Vivaldi
was ordered to ſubſcribe his name and
quality to the depoſitions, and he
obeyed.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitor then bade him conſider
of the admonition he had received, and
prepare either to confeſs on the morrow,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0247200302:219"/>
or to undergo the queſtion As he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
he gave a ſignal, and the officer,
who had conducted Vivaldi into the
chamber, immediately appeared.</p>
            <p>"You know your orders," ſaid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, "receive your priſoner, and ſee
that they are obeyed."</p>
            <p>The official bowed, and Vivaldi fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him from the apartment in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
ſilence.</p>

            <p>ELLENA, meanwhile, when ſhe had been
carried from the chapel of San Sebaſtian,
was placed upon a horſe in waiting, and,
guarded by the two men who had ſeized
her, commenced a journey, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
with little interruption during two
nights and days. She had no means of
judging whither ſhe was going, and liſtened
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0247200302:221"/>
in vain expectation, for the feet of horſes,
and the voice of Vivaldi, who, ſhe had
been told, was following on the ſ ſame
read.</p>
            <p>The ſteps of travellers ſeldom broke
upon the ſilence of theſe regions, and,
during the journey, ſhe was met only by
ſome market-people paſſing to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
town, or now and then by the
vine-dreſſers or labourers in the olive
grounds; and ſhe deſcended upon the vaſt
plains of Apulia, ſtill ignorant of her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.
An encampment, not of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
but of ſhepherds, who were leading
their flocks to the mountains of Abruzzo,
enlivened a ſmall tract of theſe levels,
which were ſhadowed on the north and
eaſt by the mountainous ridge of the
Garganus, ſtretching from the Apennine
far into the Adriatic.</p>
            <p>The appearance of the ſhepherds was
nearly as wild and ſavage as that of the
men, who conducted Ellena; but their
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0247200302:222"/>
paſtoral inſtruments of flageolets and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
ſpoke of more civilized feelings, as
they ſounded ſweetly over the deſert.
Her guards reſted, and refreſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with goats milk, barley cakes, and
almonds, and the manners of theſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
like thoſe ſhe had formerly met
with on the mountains, proved to be more
hoſpitable than their air had indicated.</p>
            <p>After Ellena had quitted this paſtoral
camp, no veſtige of a human reſidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
for ſeveral leagues, except here and
there the towers of a decayed fortreſs,
perched upon the lofty acclivities ſhe was
approaching, and half concealed in the
woods. The evening of the ſecond day
was drawing on, when her guards drew
near the foreſt, which ſhe had long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the diſtance, ſpreading over the
many-riſing ſteeps of the Garganus. They
entered by a track, a road it could not be
called, which led among oaks and gigantic
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0247200302:223"/>
cheſtnuts, apparently the growth of centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and ſo thickly interwoven, that their
branches formed a canopy which ſeldom
admitted the ſky. The gloom which they
threw around, and the thickets of cyſtus,
juniper, and lenticus, which flouriſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the ſhade, gave a character of fearful
wildneſs to the ſcene.</p>
            <p>Having reached an eminence, where the
trees were more thinly ſcattered, Ellena
perceived the foreſts ſpreading on all ſides
among hills and vallies, and deſcending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Adriatic, which bounded the
diſtance in front. The coaſt, bending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a bay, was rocky and bold. Lofty
pinnacles, wooded to their ſummits, roſe
over the ſhores, and cliffs of naked marble
of ſuch gigantic proportions, that they
were awful even at a diſtance, obtruded
themſelves far into the waves, breaſting
their eternal fury. Beyond the margin of
the coaſt, as far as the eye could reach,
appeared pointed mountains, darkened with
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0247200302:224"/>
foreſts, riſing ridge over ridge in many ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions.
Ellena, as ſhe ſurveyed this wild
ſcenery, felt as if ſhe was going into eternal
baniſhment from ſociety. She was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil,
but it was with the quietneſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
grief, not of reſignation; and ſhe
looked back upon the paſt, and awaited
the future, with a kind of out-breathed
deſpair.</p>
            <p>She had travelled for ſome miles through
the foreſt, her guards only now and then ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
to each other a queſtion, or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
concerning the changes which
had taken place in the bordering ſcenery,
ſince they laſt paſſed it, when night began
to cloſe in upon them.</p>
            <p>Ellena perceived her approach to the ſea,
only by the murmurs of its ſurge upon the
rocky coaſt, till, having reached an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
which was, however, no more than the
baſe of two woody mountains that tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
cloſely over it, ſhe ſaw dimly it's gray
ſurface ſpreading in the bay below. She
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0247200302:225"/>
now ventured to aſk how much further ſhe
was to go, and whether ſhe was to be taken
on board one of the little veſſels, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
fiſhing ſmacks, that ſhe could juſt
diſcern at anchor.</p>
            <p>"You have not far to go now," replied
one of the guards, ſurlily; "you will
ſoon be at the end of your journey, and at
reſt."</p>
            <p>They deſcended to the ſhore, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
came to a lonely dwelling, which
ſtood ſo near the margin of the ſea, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to be waſhed by the waves. No light
appeared at any of the lattices; and, from
the ſilence that reigned within, it ſeemed
to be uninhabited. The guard had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
reaſon to know otherwiſe, for they
halted at the door, and ſhouted with all
their ſtrength. No voice, however, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
to their call, and, while they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in efforts to rouſe the inhabitants,
Ellena anxiouſly examined the building,
as exactly as the twilight would permit.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0247200302:226"/>
It was of an ancient and peculiar ſtructure,
and, though ſcarcely important enough for
a manſion, had evidently never been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for the reſidence of peaſants.</p>
            <p>The walls, of unhewn marble, were high,
and ſtrengthened by baſtions; and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
had turretted corners, which, with
the porch in front, and the ſloping roof,
were falling faſt into numerous ſymptoms
of decay. The whole building, with it's
dark windows and ſoundleſs avenues, had
an air ſtrikingly forlorn and ſolitary. A
high wall ſurrounded the ſmall court in
which it ſtood, and probably had once
ſerved as a defence to the dwelling; but
the gates, which ſhould have cloſed againſt
intruders, could no longer perform their
office; one of the folds had dropped from
it's faſtenings, and lay on the ground al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
concealed in a deep bed of weeds,
and the other creaked on its hinges to
every blaſt, at each ſwing ſeeming ready to
follow the fate of it's companion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0247200302:227"/>
The repeated calls of the guard, were,
at length, anſwered by a rough voice
from within; when the door of the porch
was lazily unbarred, and opened by a man,
whoſe viſage was ſo miſery-ſtruck, that
Ellena could not look upon it with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
though wrapt in miſery of her
own. The lamp he held threw a gleam
athwart it, and ſhewed the gaunt ferocity
of famine, to which the ſhadow of his hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
eyes added a terrific wildneſs. Ellena
ſhrunk while ſhe gazed. She had never
before ſeen villainy and ſuffering ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pictured on the ſame face, and ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
him with a degree of thrilling cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
which for a moment excluded from
her mind all conſciouſneſs of the evils to
be apprehended from him.</p>
            <p>It was evident that this houſe had not
been built for his reception; and ſhe
conjectured, that he was the ſervant of
ſome cruel agent of the Marcheſa di
Vivaldi.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0247200302:228"/>
From the porch, ſhe followed into an
old hall, ruinous, and deſtitute of any kind
of furniture. It was not extenſive but
lofty, for it ſeemed to aſcend to the roof
of the edifice, and the chambers above
opened around it into a corridor.</p>
            <p>Some half-ſullen ſalutations were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
between the guard and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
whom they called Spalatro, as they
paſſed into a chamber, where, it appeared
that he had been ſleeping on a mattreſs
laid in a corner. All the other furniture
of the place, were two or three broken
chairs and a table. He eyed Ellena with
a ſhrewd contracted brow, and then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſignificantly at the guard, but was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
till he deſired them all to ſit down,
adding, that he would dreſs ſome fiſh for
ſupper. Ellena diſcovered that this ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
was the maſter of the place; it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alſo that he was the only inhabitant;
and, when the guard ſoon after informed
her their journey concluded here, her worſt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0247200302:229"/>
apprehenſions were confirmed. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
ſhe made to ſuſtain her ſpirits,
were no longer ſucceſsful. It ſeemed that
ſhe was brought hither by ruffians to a
lonely houſe on the ſea-ſhore, inhabited
by a man, who had "villain" engraved in
every line of his face, to be the victim of
inexorable pride and an inſatiable deſire of
revenge. After conſidering theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and the words, which had juſt told
her, ſhe was to go no further, conviction
ſtruck like lightning upon her heart; and,
believing ſhe was brought hither to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinated,
horror chilled all her frame, and
her ſenſes forſook her.</p>
            <p>On recovering, ſhe found herſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
by the guard and the ſtranger,
and ſhe would have ſupplicated for their
pity, but that ſhe feared to exaſperate
them by betraying her ſuſpicions. She
complained of fatigue, and requeſted to
be ſhewn to her room. The men looked
upon one another, heſitated, and then
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0247200302:230"/>
aſked her to partake of the fiſh that was
preparing. But Ellena having declined
the invitation with as good a grace as ſhe
could aſſume, they conſented that ſhe
ſhould withdraw. Spalatro, taking the
lamp, lighted her acroſs the hall, to the
corridor above, where he opened the door
of a chamber, in which he ſaid ſhe was to
ſleep.</p>
            <p>"Where is my bed?" ſaid the afflicted
Ellena, fearfully as ſhe looked round.</p>
            <p>"It is there—on the floor," replied
Spalatro, pointing to a miſerable mattreſs,
over which hung the tattered curtains of
what had once been a canopy. "If you
want the lamp," he added, "I will leave
it, and come for it in a minute or two."</p>
            <p>"Will you not let me have a lamp for
the night," ſhe ſaid in a ſupplicating and
timid voice.</p>
            <p>"For the night!" ſaid the man
gruffly; "What! to ſet fire to the
houſe."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0247200302:231"/>
Ellena ſtill entreated that he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
her the comfort of a light.</p>
            <p>"Ay, ay," replied Spalatro, with a
look ſhe could not comprehend, "it would
be a great comfort to you, truly! You do
not know what you aſk."</p>
            <p>"What is it that you mean?" ſaid El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,
eagerly; "I conjure you, in the name
of our holy church, to tell me!"</p>
            <p>Spalatro ſtepped ſuddenly back, and
looked upon her with ſurpriſe, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>"Have mercy on me!" ſaid Ellena,
greatly alarmed by his manner; "I am
friendleſs, and without help!"</p>
            <p>"What do you fear," ſaid the man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
himſelf; and then, without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her reply, added—"Is it ſuch an
unmerciful deed to take away a lamp?"</p>
            <p>Ellena, who again feared to betray the
extent of her ſuſpicions, only replied, that
it would be merciful to leave it, for that
her ſpirits were low, and ſhe required light
to cheer them in a new abode.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0247200302:232"/>
"We do not ſtand upon ſuch conceits
here," replied Spalatro, "we have other
matters to mind. Beſides, it's the only
lamp in the houſe, and the company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
are in darkneſs while I am loſing time
here. I will leave it for two minutes, and
no more." Ellena made a ſign for him
to put down the lamp; and, when he left
the room, ſhe heard the door barred upon
her.</p>
            <p>She employed theſe two minutes in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
the chamber, and the poſſibility
it might afford of an eſcape. It was a
large apartment, unfurniſhed and unſwept
of the cobweps of many years. The only
door ſhe diſcovered was the one, by which
ſhe had entered, and the only window a
lattice, which was grated. Such prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for preventing eſcape ſeemed to hint
how much there might be to eſcape from.</p>
            <p>Having examined the chamber, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding a ſingle circumſtance to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
hope, tried the ſtrength of the bars,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0247200302:233"/>
which ſhe could not ſhake, and ſought in
vain for an inſide faſtening to her door, ſhe
placed the lamp beſide it, and awaited the
return of Spalatro. In a few moments
he came, and offered her a cup of ſour wine
with a ſlice of bread; which, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſoothed by this attention, ſhe did not
think proper to reject.</p>
            <p>Spalatro then quitted the room, and
the door was again barred. Left once
more alone, ſhe tried to overcome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
by prayer; and after offering up
her veſpers with a fervent heart, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more confiding and compoſed.</p>
            <p>But it was impoſſible that ſhe could ſo
far forget the dangers of her ſituation, as
to ſeek ſleep, however wearied ſhe might
be, while the door of her room remained
unſecured againſt the intruſion of the ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians
below; and, as ſhe had no means of
faſtening it, ſhe determined to watch dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole night. Thus left to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and darkneſs, ſhe ſeated herſelf upon
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0247200302:234"/>
the mattreſs to await the return of morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and was ſoon loſt in ſad reflection;
every minute occurrence of the paſt day,
and of the conduct of her guards, moved
in review before her judgment; and, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining
theſe with the circumſtances of her
preſent ſituation, ſcarcely a doubt as to the
fate deſigned for her remained. It ſeemed
highly improbable, that the Marcheſa di
Vivaldi had ſent her hither merely for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
ſince ſhe might have confined
her in a convent, with much leſs trouble;
and ſtill more ſo, when Ellena conſidered the
character of the Marcheſa, ſuch as ſhe had
already experienced it. The appearance
of this houſe, and of the man who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
it, with the circumſtance of no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
being found residing here, each and
all of theſe ſignified, that ſhe was brought
hither, not for long impriſonment, but for
death. Her utmoſt efforts for fortitude
or reſignation could not overcome the cold
tremblings, the ſickneſs of heart, the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0247200302:235"/>
and univerſal horror, that aſſailed her.
How often, with tears of mingled terror
and grief, did ſhe call upon Vivaldi—Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi,
alas! ſar diſtant—to ſave her; how
often exclaim in agony, that ſhe ſhould
never, never ſee him more!</p>
            <p>She was ſpared, however, the horror of
believing that he was an inhabitant of the
Inquiſition. Having detected the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
which had been practiſed towards
herſelf, and that ſhe was neither on the
way to the Holy Office, nor conducted by
perſons belonging to it, ſhe concluded,
that the whole affair of Vivaldi's arreſt, had
been planned by the Marcheſa, merely as
a pretence for confining him, till ſhe
ſhould be placed beyond the reach of his
aſſiſtance. She hoped, therefore, that he
had only been ſent to ſome private reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
belonging to his family, and that,
when her fate was decided, he would be
releaſed, and ſhe be the only victim. This
was the ſole conſideration, that afforded
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0247200302:236"/>
any degree of aſſuagement to her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>The people below ſat till a late hour,
She liſtened often to their diſtant voices, as
they were diſtinguiſhable in the pauſes of
the ſurge, that broke loud and hollow on
the ſhore; and every time the creaking
hinges of their room door moved, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
they were coming to her. At
length, it appeared they had left the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or had fallen aſleep there, for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſtilneſs reigned whenever the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
of the waves ſunk. Doubt did not
long deceive her, for, while ſhe yet liſtened,
ſhe diſtinguiſhed footſteps aſcending to
the corridor. She heard them approach
her chamber, and ſtop at the door; ſhe
heard, alſo, the low whiſperings of their
voices, as they ſeemed conſulting on what
was to be done, and ſhe ſcarcely ventured
to draw breath, while ſhe intenſely attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them. Not a word, however, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly
reached her, till, as one of them
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0247200302:237"/>
was departing, another called out in a
half-whiſper, "It is below on the table,
in my girdle; make haſte." The man
came back, and ſaid ſomething in a
lower voice, to which the other replied,
"ſhe ſleeps," or Ellena was deceived by
the hiſſing conſonants of ſome other
words. He then deſcended the ſtairs;
and in a few minutes ſhe perceived his
comrade alſo paſs away from the door; ſhe
liſtened to his retreating ſteps, till the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſea was alone heard in their
ſtead.</p>
            <p>Ellena's terrors were relieved only for a
moment. Conſidering the import of the
words, it appeared that the man who had
deſcended, was gone for the ſtiletto of the
other, ſuch an inſtrument being uſually
worn in the girdle, and from the aſſurance,
"ſhe ſleeps," he ſeemed to fear that his
words had been overheard; and ſhe liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again for their ſteps; but they came
no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0247200302:238"/>
Happily for Ellena's peace, ſhe knew
not that her chamber had a door, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
as to open without ſound, by which
aſſaſſins might enter unſuſpectedly at any
hour of the night. Believing that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of this houſe had now retired to
reſt, her hopes and her ſpirits began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive;
but ſhe was yet ſleepleſs and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul.
She meaſured the chamber with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
ſteps, often ſtarting as the old
boards ſhook and groaned where ſhe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and often pauſing to liſten whether
all was yet ſtill in the corridor. The
gleam, which a riſing moon threw between
the bars of her window, now began to
ſhew many ſhadowy objects in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which ſhe did not recollect to have
obſerved while the lamp was there. More
than once, ſhe fancied ſhe ſaw ſomething
glide along towards the place where the
mattreſs was laid, and, almoſt congealed
with terror, ſhe ſtood ſtill to watch it;
but the illuſion, if ſuch it was, diſappeared
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0247200302:239"/>
where the moon-light faded, and even her
fears could not give ſhape to it beyond.
Had ſhe not known that her chamber-door
remained ſtrongly barred, ſhe would
have believed this was an aſſaſſin ſtealing
to the bed where it might be ſuppoſed ſhe
ſlept. Even now the thought occurred
to her, and vague as it was, had power to
ſtrike an anguiſh, almoſt deadly, through
her heart, while ſhe conſidered that her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
ſituation was nearly as perilous as
the one ſhe had imaged. Again ſhe liſtened,
and ſcarcely dared to breathe; but not the
lighteſt ſound occurred in the pauſes of
the waves, and ſhe believed herſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that no perſon except herſelf was
in the room. That ſhe was deceived in
this belief, appeared from her unwillingneſs
to approach the mattreſs, while it was yet
involved in ſhade. Unable to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
her reluctance, ſhe took her ſtation
at the window, till the ſtrengthening rays
ſhould allow a clearer view of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0247200302:240"/>
and in ſome degree reſtore her confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and ſhe watched the ſcene without
as it gradually became viſible. The moon,
riſing over the ocean, ſhewed it's reſtleſs
ſurface ſpreading to the wide horizon;
and the waves, which broke in foam upon
the rocky beach below, retiring in long
white lines far upon the waters. She
liſtened to their meaſured and ſolemn
ſound, and, ſomewhat ſoothed by the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
grandeur of the view, remained at the
lattice till the moon had riſen high into
the heavens; and even till morning began
to dawn upon the ſea, and purple the
eaſtern clouds.</p>
            <p>Re-aſſured, by the light that now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
her room, ſhe returned to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs;
where anxiety at length yielded to
her wearineſs, and ſhe obtained a ſhort
repoſe.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>ELLENA was awakened from profound
ſleep, by a loud noiſe at the door of her
chamber; when, ſtarting from her mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
ſhe looked around her with ſurpriſe
and diſmay, as imperfect recollections or
the paſt began to gather on her mind.
She diſtinguiſhed the undrawing of iron
bars, and then the countenance of Spalatro
at her door, before ſhe had a clear remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of her ſituation—that ſhe was a
priſoner in a houſe on a lonely ſhore, and
that this man was her jailor. Such ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0247200302:242"/>
of the heart returned with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
ſuch faintneſs and terror, that
unable to ſupport her trembling frame,
ſhe ſunk again upon the mattreſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
demanding the reaſon of this abrupt
intruſion.</p>
            <p>"I have brought you ſome breakfaſt,"
ſaid Spalatro, "if you are awake to take
it; but you ſeem to be aſleep yet. Surely
you have had ſleep ſufficient for one night;
you went to reſt ſoon enough."</p>
            <p>Ellena made no reply, but, deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with a ſenſe of her ſituation, looked
with beſeeching eyes at the man, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
holding forth an oaten cake and
a baſon of milk. "Where ſhall I ſet them?"
ſaid he, "you muſt needs be
glad of them, ſince you had no ſupper."</p>
            <p>Ellena thanked him, and deſired he
would place them on the floor, for there
was neither table nor chair in the room.
As he did this, ſhe was ſtruck with the
expreſſion of his countenance, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0247200302:243"/>
a ſtrange mixture of archneſs and
malignity. He ſeemed congratulating
himſelf upon his ingenuity, and anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſome occaſion of triumph; and ſhe
was ſo much intereſted, that her obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
never quitted him while he remained
in the room. As his eyes accidentally met
her's, he turned them away, with the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptneſs
of a perſon who is conſcious of
evil intentions, and fears leſt they ſhould
be detected; nor once looked up till he
haſtily left the chamber, when ſhe heard
the door ſecured as formerly.</p>
            <p>The impreſſion, which his look had
left on her mind, ſo wholly engaged her
in conjecture, that a conſiderable time
elapſed before ſhe remembered that he
had brought the refreſhment ſhe ſo much
required; but, as ſhe now lifted it to her
lips, a horrible ſuſpicion arreſted her hand;
it was not, however, before ſhe had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a ſmall quantity of the milk. The
look of Spalatro, which occaſioned her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0247200302:244"/>
had accompanied the ſetting down of
the breakfaſt, and it occurred to her, that
poiſon was infuſed in this liquid. She
was thus compelled to refuſe the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which was become neceſſary to her,
for ſhe feared to taſte even of the oaten
cake, ſince Spalatro had offered it, but the
little milk ſhe had unwarily taken, was ſo
very ſmall that ſhe had no apprehenſion
concerning it.</p>
            <p>The day, however, was paſſed in terror,
and almoſt in deſpondency; ſhe could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubt the purpoſe, for which ſhe had
been brought hither, nor diſcover any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of eſcaping from her perſecutors; yet
that propenſity to hope, which buoys up
the human heart, even in the ſevereſt hours
of trial, ſuſtained, in ſome degree, her
fainting ſpirits.</p>
            <p>During theſe miſerable hours of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and ſuſpenſe, the only alleviation to
her ſuffering aroſe from a belief, that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid
was ſafe, at leaſt from danger, though
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0247200302:245"/>
not from grief; but ſhe now underſtood
too much of the dexterous contrivances
of the Marcheſa, his mother, to think it
was practicable for him to eſcape from
her deſigns, and again reſtore her to
liberty.</p>
            <p>All day Ellena either leaned againſt the
bars of her window, loſt in reverie, while
her unconſcious eyes were fixed upon the
ocean, whoſe murmurs ſhe no longer
heard; or ſhe liſtened for ſome ſound
from within the houſe, that might aſſiſt
her conjectures, as to the number of
perſons below, or what might be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
there. The houſe, however, was
profoundly ſtill, except when now and
then a footſtep ſauntered along a diſtant
paſſage, or a door was heard to cloſe; but
not the hum of a ſingle voice aroſe from
the lower rooms, nor any ſymptom of
there being more than one perſon, beſide
herſelf, in the dwelling. Though ſhe had
not heard her former guards depart, it
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0247200302:246"/>
appeared certain that they were gone, and
that ſhe was left alone in this place with
Spalatro. What could be the purport of
ſuch a proceeding, Ellena could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
if her death was deſigned, it ſeemed
ſtrange that one perſon only ſhould be left
to the hazard of the deed, when three muſt
have rendered the completion of it certain.
But this ſurpriſe vaniſhed, when her ſusſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of poiſon returned; for it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that theſe men had believed their
ſcheme to be already nearly accompliſhed,
and had abandoned her to die alone, in a
chamber from whence eſcape was imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable,
leaving Spalatro to diſpoſe of her
remains. All the incongruities ſhe had
ſeparately obſerved in their conduct, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
now to harmonize and unite in one
plan; and her death, deſigned by poiſon,
and that poiſon to be conveyed in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
of nouriſhment, appeared to have
been the object of it. Whether it was that
the ſtrength of this conviction affected her
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0247200302:247"/>
fancy, or that the cauſe was real, Ellena,
remembering at this moment that ſhe
had taſted the milk, was ſeized with an
univerſal ſhuddering, and thought ſhe
felt that the poiſon had been ſufficiently
potent to affect her, even in the inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
quantity ſhe might have taken.</p>
            <p>While ſhe was thus agitated, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
footſteps loitering near her door,
and attentively liſtening, became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that ſome perſon was in the corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.
The ſteps moved ſoftly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſtopping for an inſtant, as if to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
time for liſtening, and ſoon after
paſſed away.</p>
            <p>"It is Spalatro!" ſaid Ellena; "he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
that I have taken the poiſon, and he
comes to liſten for my dying groans!
Alas! he is only come ſomewhat too ſoon,
perhaps!"</p>
            <p>As this horrible ſuppoſition occurred,
the ſhuddering returned with encreaſed
violence, and ſhe ſunk, almoſt fainting, on
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0247200302:248"/>
the mattreſs; but the fit was not of long
continuance. When it gradually left her,
and recollection revived, ſhe perceived,
however, the prudence of ſuffering Spala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro
to ſuppoſe ſhe had taken the beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
he brought her, ſince ſuch belief
would at leaſt procure ſome delay of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſchemes, and every delay afforded
ſome poſſibility for hope to reſt upon.
Ellena, therefore, poured through the bars
of her window, the milk, which ſhe believed
Spalatro had deſigned ſhould be fatal in its
conſequence.</p>
            <p>It was evening, when ſhe again fancied
footſteps were lingering near her door, and
the ſuſpicion was confirmed, when, on
turning her eyes, ſhe perceived a ſhade on
the floor, underneath it, as of ſome perſon
ſtationed without. Preſently the ſhadow
glided away, and at the ſame time ſhe
diſtinguiſhed departing ſteps treading cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly.</p>
            <p>"It is he!" ſaid Ellena; "he ſtill liſtens
for my moans!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0247200302:249"/>
This further confirmation of his deſigns
affected her nearly as much as the firſt;
when anxiouſly turning her looks towards
the corridor, the ſhadow again appeared
beneath the door, but ſhe heard no ſtep.
Ellena now watched it with intenſe ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and expectation; fearing every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
that Spalatro would conclude her
doubts by entering the room. "And O!
when he diſcovers that I live," thought
ſhe, "what may I not expect during the
firſt moments of his diſappointment!
What leſs than immediate death!"</p>
            <p>The ſhadow, after remaining a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
ſtationary, moved a little, and then
glided away as before. But it quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and a low ſound followed, as of
ſome perſon endeavouring to unfaſten
bolts without noiſe. Ellena heard one
bar gently undrawn, and then another;
ſhe obſerved the door begin to move, and
then to give way, till it gradually uncloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the face of Spalatro preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0247200302:250"/>
from behind it. Without immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entering, he threw a glance round the
chamber, as if he wiſhed to aſcertain ſome
circumſtance before he ventured further.
His look was more than uſually haggard
as it reſted upon Ellena, who apparently
repoſed on her mattreſs.</p>
            <p>Having gazed at her for an inſtant, he
ventured towards the bed with quick and
unequal ſteps; his countenance expreſſed
at once impatience, alarm, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
of guilt. When he was within
a few paces, Ellena raiſed herſelf, and he
ſtarted back as if a ſudden ſpectre had
croſſed him. The more than uſual wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and wanneſs of his looks, with the
whole of his conduct, ſeemed to confirm
all her former terrors; and, when he rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſked her how ſhe did, Ellena had not
ſufficient preſence of mind to anſwer that
ſhe was ill. For ſome moments, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
her with an earneſt and ſullen at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and then a ſly glance of ſcrutiny,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0247200302:251"/>
which he threw round the chamber, told
her that he was enquiring whether ſhe had
taken the poiſon. On perceiving that the
baſon was empty, he lifted it from the
floor, and Ellena fancied a gleam of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
paſſed over his viſage.</p>
            <p>"You have had no dinner." ſaid he, "I
forgot you; but ſupper will ſoon be ready;
and you may walk up the beach till then,
if you will."</p>
            <p>Ellena, extremely ſurpriſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
by this offer of a ſeeming indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
knew not whether to accept or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it. She ſuſpected that ſome treachery
lurked within it. The invitation appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be only a ſtratagem to lure her to
deſtruction, and ſhe determined to decline
accepting it; when again ſhe conſidered,
that to accompliſh this, it was not neceſſary
to withdraw her from the chamber, where
ſhe was already ſufficiently in the power of
her perſecutors. Her ſituation could not
be more deſperate than it was at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0247200302:252"/>
and almoſt any change might make it
leſs ſo.</p>
            <p>As ſhe deſcended from the corridor, and
paſſed through the lower part of the houſe,
no perſon appeared but her conductor;
and ſhe ventured to enquire, whether the
men who had brought her hither were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
Spalatro did not return an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but led the way in ſilence to the
court, and, having paſſed the gates, he
pointed toward the weſt, and ſaid ſhe
might walk that way.</p>
            <p>Ellena bent her courſe towards the "ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-ſounding
waves," followed at a ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
by Spalatro, and, wrapt in thought,
purſued the windings of the ſhore, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noticing the objects around her; till,
on paſſing the foot of a rock, ſhe lifted her
eyes to the ſcene that unfolded beyond,
and obſerved ſome huts ſcattered at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
diſtance, apparently the reſidence
of fiſhermen. She could juſt diſtinguiſh
the dark ſails of ſome ſkiffs turning the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0247200302:253"/>
cliffs, and entering the little bay, where the
hamlet margined the beach; but, though
ſhe ſaw the ſails lowered, as the boats ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
the ſhore, they were too far off
to allow the figures of the men to appear.
To Ellena, who had believed that no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
habitation, except her priſon, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the vaſt ſolitudes of theſe foreſts
and ſhores, the view of the huts, remote
as they were, imparted a feeble hope, and
even ſomewhat of joy. She looked back,
to obſerve whether Spalatro was near; he
was already within a few paces; and, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a wiſtful glance forward to the remote
cottages, her heart ſunk again.</p>
            <p>It was a lowering evening, and the ſea
was dark and ſwelling; the ſcreams of the
ſea-birds too, as they wheeled among the
clouds, and ſought their high neſts in the
rocks, ſeemed to indicate an approaching
ſtorm. Ellena was not ſo wholly engaged
by ſelfiſh ſufferings, but that ſhe could
ſympathiſe with thoſe of others, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0247200302:254"/>
ſhe rejoiced that the fiſherman, whoſe
boats ſhe had obſerved, had eſcaped the
threatening tempeſt, and were ſafely ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in their little homes, where, as they
heard the loud waves break along the
coaſt, they could look with keener plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
upon the ſocial circle, and the warm
comforts around them. From ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
however, ſhe returned again to
a ſenſe of her own forlorn and friendleſs
ſituation.</p>
            <p>"Alas!" ſaid ſhe, "I have no longer a
home, a circle to ſmile welcomes upon
me! I have no longer even one friend to
ſupport, to reſcue me! I—a miſerable
wanderer on a diſtant ſhore! tracked, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
by the footſteps of the aſſaſſin, who
at this inſtant eyes his victim with ſilent
watchfulneſs and awaits the moment of
opportunity to ſacrifice her!"</p>
            <p>Ellena ſhuddered as ſhe ſaid this, and
turned again to obſerve whether Spalatro
was near. He was not within view; and,
while ſhe wondered, and congratulated
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0247200302:255"/>
herſelf on a poſſibility of eſcaping, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Monk walking ſilently beneath the
dark rocks that overbrowed the beach. His
black garments were folded round him;
his face was inclined towards the ground,
and he had the air of a man in deep medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>"His, no doubt, are worthy muſings!"
ſaid Ellena, as ſhe obſerved him, with
mingled hope and ſurpriſe. "I may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
myſelf, without fear, to one of his
order. It is probably as much his wiſh,
as it is his duty, to ſuccour the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
Who could have hoped to find
on this ſequeſtered ſhore ſo ſacred a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector!
his convent cannot be far off."</p>
            <p>He approached, his face ſtill bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ground, and Ellena advanced
ſlowly, and with trembling ſteps, to meet
him. As he drew near, he viewed her
aſkance, without lifting his head; but ſhe
perceived his large eyes looking from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſhade of his cowl, and the upper
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0247200302:256"/>
of his peculiar countenance. Her confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his protection began to fail, and
ſhe faultered, unable to ſpeak, and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
daring to meet his eyes. The Monk
ſtalked paſt her in ſilence, the lower part
of his viſage ſtill, muffled in his drapery,
and as he paſſed her looked neither with
curioſity, nor ſurprise.</p>
            <p>Ellena pauſed, and determined, when
he ſhould be at ſome diſtance, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make her way to the hamlet, and
throw herſelf upon the humanity of it's
inhabitants, rather than ſolicit the pity of
this forbidding ſtranger. But in the next
moment ſhe heard a ſtep behind her, and,
on turning, ſaw the Monk again approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He ſtalked by as before, ſurveying
her, however, with a ſly and ſcrutinizing
glance from the corners of his eyes. His
air and countenance were equally repulſive,
arid ſtill Ellena could not ſummon courage
enough to attempt engaging his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but ſhrunk as from an enemy.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0247200302:257"/>
There was ſomething alſo terrific in the
ſilent ſtalk of ſo gigantic a form; it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
both power and treachery. He
paſſed ſlowly on to ſome diſtance, and
diſappeared among the rocks.</p>
            <p>Ellena turned once more with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of haſtening towards the diſtant
hamlet, before Spalatro ſhould obſerve her,
whoſe ſtrange abſence ſhe had ſcarcely
time to wonder at; but ſhe had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
far, when ſuddenly ſhe perceived
the Monk again at her ſhoulder. She
ſtarted, and almoſt ſhrieked; while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
her with more attention than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
He pauſed a moment, and ſeemed
to heſitate; after which he again paſſed
on in ſilence. The diſtreſs of Ellena en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;
he was gone the way ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to run, and ſhe feared almoſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to follow him, and to return to her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Preſently he turned, and paſſed her
again, and Ellena haſtened forward. But,
when fearful of being, purſued, ſhe again
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0247200302:258"/>
looked back, ſhe obſerved him conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with Spalatro. They appeared to
be in conſultation, while they ſlowly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
till, probably obſerving her rapid
progreſs, Spalatro called on her to ſtop, in
a voice that echoed among all the rocks.
It was a voice, which would not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed.
She looked hopeleſsly at the ſtill
diſtant cottages, and ſlackened her ſteps.
Preſently the Monk again paſſed before
her, and Spalatro had again diſappeared.
The frown, with which the former now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
Ellena, was ſo terrific, that ſhe
ſhrunk trembling back, though ſhe knew
him not for her perſecutor, ſince ſhe had
never conſcibuſly ſeen Schedoni. He was
agitated, and his look became darker.</p>
            <p>"Whither go you?" ſaid he in a voice
that was ſtifled by emotion.</p>
            <p>"Who is it, father, that aſks the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?"
ſaid Ellena, endeavouring to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
compoſed.</p>
            <p>"Whither go you, and who are you?"
repeated the Monk more ſternly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0247200302:259"/>
"I am an unhappy orphan," replied
Ellena, ſighing deeply, "If you are, as your
habit denotes, a friend to the charities,
you will regard me with compaſſion."</p>
            <p>Schedoni was ſilent, and then ſaid—"Who,
and what is it that you fear?"</p>
            <p>"I fear—even for my life," replied
Ellena, with heſitation. She obſerved a
darker ſhade paſs over his countenance.
"For your life!" ſaid he, with apparent
ſurpriſe, "who is there that would think
it worth the taking."</p>
            <p>Ellena was ſtruck with theſe words.</p>
            <p>"Poor inſect!" added Schedoni, "who
would cruſh thee?"</p>
            <p>Ellena made no reply; ſhe remained
with her eyes fixed in amazement upon
his face. There was ſomething in his
manner of pronouncing this, yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
than in the words themſelves.
Alarmed by his manner, and awed by the
encreaſing gloom, and ſwelling ſurge, that
broke in thunder on the beach, ſhe at
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0247200302:260"/>
length turned away, and again walked
towards the hamlet which was yet very
remote.</p>
            <p>He ſoon overtook her; when rudely
ſeizing her arm, and gazing earneſtly on
her face, "Who is it, that you fear?" ſaid
he, "ſay who!"</p>
            <p>"That is more than I dare ſay," replied
Ellena, ſcarcely able to ſuſtain herſelf;</p>
            <p>"Hah! is it even ſo!" ſaid the Monk,
with encreaſing emotion. His viſage how
became ſo terrible, that Ellena ſtruggled to
liberate her arm, and ſupplicated that he
would not detain her. He was ſilent and
ſtill gazed upon her, but his eyes, when
ſhe had ceaſed to ſtruggle, aſſumed the
fixt and vacant glare of a man, whoſe
thoughts have retired within themſelves,
and who is no longer conſcious to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
objects.</p>
            <p>"I beſeech you to releaſe me!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Ellena, "it is late, and I am far
from home."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0247200302:261"/>
"That is true," muttered Schedom, ſtill
graſping her arm, and ſeeming to reply to
his own thoughts rather than to her words,
—"that is very true."</p>
            <p>"The evening is cloſing faſt," continued
Ellena, "and I ſhall be overtaken by the
ſtorm."</p>
            <p>Schedoni ſtill muſed, and then mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
—"The ſtorm, ſay you? Why ay,
let it come."</p>
            <p>As he ſpoke, he ſuffered her arm to
drop, but ſtill held it, and walked ſlowly
towards the houſe. Ellena, thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to accompany him, and yet more
alarmed both by his looks, his incoherent
anſwers, and his approach to her priſon,
renewed her ſupplications and her efforts
for liberty, in a voice of piercing diſtreſs,
adding, "I am far from home, father;
night is coming on. See how the rocks
darken! I am far from home, and ſhall
be waited for."</p>
            <p>"That is falſe!" ſaid Schedoni, with
emphaſis; "and you know it to be ſo."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0247200302:262"/>
"Alas! I do," replied Ellena, with
mingled ſhame and grief, "I have no
friends to wait for me!"</p>
            <p>"What do thoſe deſerve, who delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
utter falſehoods," continued the
Monk, "who deceive, and flatter young
men to their deſtruction?"</p>
            <p>"Father!" exclaimed the aſtoniſhed
Ellena.</p>
            <p>"Who diſturb the peace of families—who
trepan, with wanton arts, the heirs
of noble houſes—who—hah! what do ſuch
deſerve?"</p>
            <p>Overcome with aſtoniſhment and terror,
Ellena remained ſilent. She now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that Schedoni, ſo far from being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to prove a proteſtor, was an agent of her
worſt, and as ſhe had believed her only
enemy; and an apprehenſion of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
and terrible vengeance, which
ſuch an agent ſeemed willing to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh,
ſubdued her ſenſes; ſhe tottered,
and ſunk upon the beach. The weight,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0247200302:263"/>
which ſtrained the arm Schedoni held,
called his attention to her ſituation.</p>
            <p>As he gazed upon her helpleſs and faded
form, he became agitated. He quitted
it, and traverſed the beach in ſhort turns,
and with haſty ſteps; came back again,
and bent over it—his heart ſeemed ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſome touch of pity. At one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ſtepped towards the ſea, and
taking water in the hollows of his hands,
threw it upon her face; at another, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to regret that he had done ſo, he
would ſtamp with ſudden fury upon the
ſhore, and walk abruptly to a diſtance.
The conflict between his deſign and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
was ſtrong, or, perhaps, it was only
between his paſſions. He, who had hitherto
been inſenſible to every tender feeling, who,
governed by ambition and reſentment had
contributed, by his artful inſtigations, to
fix the baleful reſolution of the Marcheſa
di Vivaldi, and who was come to execute
her purpoſe,—even he could not now
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0247200302:264"/>
look upon the innocent, the wretched
Ellena, without yielding to the momentary
weakneſs, as he termed it, of compaſſion.</p>
            <p>While he was yet unable to baffle the
new emotion by evil paſſions, he deſpiſed
that which conquered him. "And ſhall
the weakneſs of a girl," ſaid he, "ſubdue
the reſolution of a man! Shall the view
of her tranſient ſufferings unnerve my firm
heart, and compel me to renounce the
lofty plans I have ſo ardently, ſo labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
imagined, at the very inſtant when
they are changing into realities! Am I
awake! Is one ſpark of the fire, which
has ſo long ſmouldered within my boſom,
and conſumed my peace, alive! Or am
I tame and abject as my fortunes? hah! as
my fortunes! Shall the ſpirit of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
yield for ever to circumſtances? The
queſtion rouſes it, and I feel it's energy
revive within me."</p>
            <p>He ſtalked with haſty ſteps towards
Ellena, as if he feared to truſt his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0247200302:265"/>
with a ſecond pauſe. He had a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
concealed beneath his Monk's habit;
as he had alſo an aſſaſſin's heart ſhrouded
by his garments. He had a dagger—but
he heſitated to uſe it, the blood which it
might ſpill, would be obſerved by the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
of the neighbouring hamlet, and
might lead to a diſcovery. It would be
ſafer, he conſidered, and eaſier, to lay Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
ſenſeleſs as ſhe was, in the waves; their
coldneſs would recal her to life, only at the
moment before they would ſuffocate her.</p>
            <p>As he ſtooped to lift her, his reſolution
faultered again, on beholding her innocent
face, and in that moment ſhe moved.
He ſtarted back, as if ſhe could have
known his purpoſe, and, knowing it, could,
have avenged herſelf. The water, which
he had thrown upon her face, had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
revived her; ſhe uncloſed her eyes,
and, on perceiving him, ſhrieked, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to rife. His reſolution was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
ſo tremblingly fearful is guilt in the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0247200302:266"/>
moment when it would execute it's atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.
Overcome with apprehenſions, yet
agitated with ſhame and indignation
againſt himſelf for being ſo, he gazed at
her, for an inſtant in ſilence, and then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
turned away his eyes and left her.
Ellena liſtened to his departing ſteps, and,
raiſing herſelf, obſerved him retiring
among the rocks that led towards the
houſe. Aſtoniſhed at his conduct, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
to find that ſhe was alone, Ellena
renewed all her efforts to ſuſtain herſelf, till
ſhe ſhould reach the hamlet ſo long the
object of her hopes; but ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
only, a few paces, when Spalatro
again appeared ſwiftly approaching. Her
utmoſt exertion availed her nothing; her
feeble ſteps were ſoon overtaken, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena
perceived herſelf again his priſoner.
The look with which ſhe reſigned herſelf,
awakened no pity in Spalatro, who ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
ſome taunting jeſt upon the ſwiftneſs
of her flight, as he led her back to her
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0247200302:267"/>
priſon, and proceeded in ſullen watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Once again, then, ſhe entered the
gloomy walls of that fatal manſion, never
more, ſhe now believed, to quit them with
life, a belief, which was ſtrengthened when
ſhe remembered that the Monk, on leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, had taken the way hither; for,
though ſhe knew not how to account for
his late forbearance, ſhe could not ſuppoſe
that he would long be merciful. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
no more, however, as ſhe paſſed
to her chamber, where Spalatro left her
again to ſolitude and terror, and ſhe heard
that fateful door again barred upon her.
When his retreating ſteps had ceaſed to
ſound, a ſtilneſs, as of the grave, prevailed
in the houſe; like the dead calm, which
ſometimes precedes the horrors of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt.</p>

            <p>SCHEDONI had returned from the beach
to the houſe, in a ſtate of perturbation,
that defied the controul of even his own
ſtern will. On the way thither he met
Spalatro, whom, as he diſpatched him to
Ellena, he ſtrictly commanded not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
his chamber till he ſhould be
ſummoned.</p>
            <p>Having reached his apartment, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the door, though not any perſon,
except himſelf, was in the houſe, nor any
one expected, but thoſe who he knew
would not dare to intrude upon him.
Had it been poſſible to have ſhut out
all conſciouſneſs of himſelf, alſo, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0247200302:269"/>
would he have done ſo! He threw
himſelf into a chair, and remained for a
conſiderable time motionleſs and loſt in
thought, yet the emotions of his mind
were violent and contradictory. At the
very inſtant when his heart reproached
him with the crime he had meditated,
he regretted the ambitious views he muſt
relinquiſh if he failed to perpetrate it, and
regarded himſelf with ſome degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
for having hitherto heſitated on the
ſubject. He conſidered the character of
his own mind with aſtoniſhment, for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
had drawn forth traits, of
which, till now, he had no ſuſpicion. He
knew not by what doctrine to explain the
inconſiſtencies, the contradictions, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced,
and, perhaps, it was not one of
the leaſt that in theſe moments of direful
and conflicting paſſions, his reaſon could
ſtill look down upon their operations, and
lead him to a cool, though brief examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own nature. But the ſubtlety
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0247200302:270"/>
of ſelf-love ſtill eluded his enquiries, and
he did not detect that pride was even at
this inſtant of ſelf-examination, and of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
import, the maſter-ſpring of his mind.
In the earlieſt dawn of his character this
paſſion had displayed its predominancy,
whenever occaſion permitted, and it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
had led to ſome of the chief events
of his life.</p>
            <p>The Count di Marinella, for ſuch had
formerly been the title of the Confeſſor,
was the younger ſon of an ancient family,
who reſided in the duchy of Milan, and
near the feet of the Tyrolean Alps, on ſuch
eſtates of their anceſtors, as the Italian
wars of a former century had left them.
The portion, which he had received at
the death of his father, was not large, and
Schedoni was not of a diſpoſition to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his patrimony by ſlow diligence, or
to ſubmit to the reſtraint and humiliation,
which his narrow finances would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
He diſdained to acknowledge an

inferiority of fortune to thoſe, with whom
he considered himſelf equal in rank; and,
as he was destitute of generous feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of ſound judgment, he had not
that loftineſs of ſoul, which is ambitious
of true grandeur. On the contrary, he
was ſatisfied with an oſtentatious diſplay
of pleaſures and of power, and, thoughtleſs
of the conſequence of diſſipation, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the pleaſures of the moment, till
his exhauſted reſources compelled him to
pauſe, and to reflect. He perceived, too
late for his advantage, that it was neceſſary
for him to diſpoſe of part of his eſtate, and
to confine himſelf to the income of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder.
Incapable of ſubmitting with
grace to the reduction, which his folly
had rendered expedient, he endeavoured
to obtain by cunning, the luxuries that
his prudence had failed to keep, and which
neither his genius or his integrity could
command. He withdrew, however, from
the eyes of his neighbours, unwilling to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0247200302:276"/>
ſubmit his altered circumſtances to their
obſervation.</p>
            <p>Concerning ſeveral years of his life,
from this period, nothing was generally
known; and, when he was next diſcovered,
it was in the Spirito Santo convent at
Naples, in the habit of a Monk, and under
the aſſumed name of Schedoni. His air
and countenance were as much altered as
his way of life; his looks had become
gloomy and ſevere, and the pride, which
had mingled with the gaiety of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
expreſſion, occaſionally diſcovered it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
under the diſguiſe of humility, but
more frequently in the auſterity of ſilence,
and in the barbarity of penance.</p>
            <p>The perſon who diſcovered Schedoni,
would not have recollected him, had not
his remarkable eyes firſt fixed his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and then revived remembrance. As
he examined his features, he traced the
faint reſemblance of what Marinella had
been, to whom he made himſelf known.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0247200302:277"/>
The Confeſſor affected to have forgotten
his former acquaintance, and aſſured him,
that he was miſtaken reſpecting himſelf,
till the ſtrenger ſo cloſely urged ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
that the former was no longer
permitted to diſſemble. He retired, in
ſome emotion, with the ſtranger, and,
whatever might be the ſubject of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
he drew from him, before he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the convent, a tremendous vow, to
keep ſecret from the brotherhood his
knowledge of Schedoni's family, and never
to reveal without thoſe walls, that he had
ſeen him. Theſe requeſts he had urged
in a manner, that at once ſurpriſed and
awed the ſtranger, and which at the ſame
time that it maniſeſted the weight of Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni's
fears, bade the former tremble for
the conſequence of diſobedience; and he
ſhuddered even while he promiſed to obey.
Of the firſt part of the promiſe he was
probably ſtrictly obſervant; whether he
was equally ſo of the ſecond, does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0247200302:278"/>
it is certain, that after this period,
he was never more ſeen or heard of at
Naples.</p>
            <p>Schedoni, ever ambitious of diſtinction,
adapted his manners to the views and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of the ſociety with whom he reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and became one of the moſt exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers
of their outward forms, and almoſt
a prodigy for ſelf-denial and ſevere diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
He was pointed out by the fathers
of the convent to the juniors as a great
example, who was, however, rather to be
looked up to with reverential admiration,
than with an hope of emulating his ſublime
virtues. But with ſuch panegyrics their
friendſhip for Schedoni concluded. They
found it convenient to applaud the auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
which they declined to practiſe; it
procured them a character for ſanctity,
and ſaved them the neceſſity of earning
it by mortifications of their own; but
they both feared and hated Schedoni for
his pride and his gloomy auſterities, too
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0247200302:279"/>
much, to gratify his ambition by any thing
further than empty praiſe. He had been
ſeveral years in the ſociety, without obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any conſiderable advancement, and with
the mortification of ſeeing perſons, who
had never emulated his ſeverity, raiſed to
high offices in the church. Somewhat too
late he diſcovered, that he was not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any ſubſtantial favour from the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood,
and then it was that his reſtleſs
and diſappointed ſpirit firſt ſought prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by other avenues. He had been
ſome years Confeſſor to the Marcheſa di
Vivaldi, when the conduct of her ſon
awakened his hopes, by ſhowing him, that
he might render himſelf not only uſeful
but neceſſary to her, by his councils. It
was his cuſtom to ſtudy the characters of
thoſe around him, with a view of adapting
them to his purpoſes, and, having aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that of the Marcheſa, theſe hopes
were encouraged. He perceived that her
paſſions were ſtrong, her judgment weak,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0247200302:280"/>
and he underſtood, that, if circumſtances
ſhould ever enable him to be ſerviceable in
promoting the end at which any one of
thoſe paſſions might aim, his fortune
would be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>At length, he ſo completely inſinuated
himſelf into her confidence, and became
ſo neceſſary to her views, that he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his own terms, and this he had not
failed to do, though with all the affected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
and fineſſe that his ſituatio ſeemed
to require. An office of high dignity in the
church, which had long vainly excited his
ambition, was promiſed him by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa,
who had ſufficient influence to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it; her condition was that of his preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the honour of her family, as ſhe delicately
termed it, which ſhe was careful to make
him underſtand could be ſecured only by the
death of Ellena. He acknowledged, with
the Marcheſa, that the death of this faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
young woman was the only means of
preſerving that honour, ſince, if ſhe lived,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0247200302:281"/>
they had every evil to expect from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
and character of Vivaldi, who
would diſcover and extricate her from any
place of confinement, however obſcure or
difficult of acceſs, to which ſhe might be
conveyed. How long and how arduouſly
the Confeſſor had aimed to oblige the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa,
has already appeared. The laſt
ſcene was now arrived, and he was on the
eve of committing that atrocious act,
which was to ſecure the pride of her houſe,
and to ſatisfy at once his ambition and his
deſire of vengeance; when an emotion new
and ſurpriſing to him, had arreſted his
arm, and compelled his reſolution to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But this emotion was tranſient, it
disappeared almoſt with the object that
had awakened it; and now, in the ſilence
and retirement of his chamber, he had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to recollect his thoughts, to review his
ſchemes, to re-animate his reſolution, and
to wonder again at the pity, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
won him from his purpoſe. The
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0247200302:282"/>
ruling paſſion of his nature once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
it's authority, and he determined to
earn the honour, which the Marcheſa had
in ſtore for him.</p>
            <p>After ſome cool, and more of tumultuous,
conſideration, he reſolved that Ellena ſhould
be aſſaſſinated that night, while ſhe ſlept,
and afterwards conveyed through a paſſage
of the houſe communicating with the ſea,
into which the body might be thrown and
buried, with her ſad ſtory, beneath the
waves. For his own ſake, he would have
avoided the danger of ſhedding blood,
had this appeared eaſy; but he had too
much reaſon to know ſhe had ſuſpicions
of poiſon, to truſt to a ſecond attempt by
ſuch means; and again his indignation
roſe againſt himſelf, ſince by yielding to a
momentary companion, he had loſt the
opportunity afforded him of throwing her
unreſiſtingly into the ſurge.</p>
            <p>Spalatro, as has already been hinted,
was a former confident of the Confeſſor,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0247200302:283"/>
who knew too truly, from experience, that
he could be truſted, and had, therefore,
engaged him to aſſiſt on this occaſion. To
the hands of this man he conſigned the
fete of the unhappy Ellena, himſelf recoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the horrible act he had willed;
and intending by ſuch a ſtep to involve
Spalatro more deeply in the guilt, and
thus more effectually to ſecure his ſecret.</p>
            <p>The night was far advanced before
Schedoni's final reſolution was taken, when
he ſummoned Spalatro to his chamber to
inſtruct him in his office. He bolted the
door, by which the man had entered, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
that themſelves were the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the houſe, except the poor Ellena,
who, unſuſpicious of what was conſpiring,
and her ſpirits worn out by the late ſcene,
was ſleeping peacefully on her mattreſs
above. Schedoni moved ſoftly from the
door he had ſecured, and, beckoning Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro
to approach, ſpoke in a low voice,
as if he feared to be overheard. "Have
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0247200302:284"/>
you perceived any ſound from her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
lately?" ſaid he, "Does ſhe ſleep,
think you?"</p>
            <p>"No one has moved there for this hour
paſt, at leaſt," replied Spalatro, "I have
been watching in the corridor, till you
called, and ſhould have heard if ſhe had
ſtirred, the old floor ſhakes ſo with every
ſtep."</p>
            <p>"Then hear rue, Spalatro," ſaid the
Confeſſor. "I have tried, and found thee
faithful, or I ſhould not truſt thee in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of confidence like this. Recollect
all I ſaid to thee in the morning, and be
reſolute and dexterous, as I have ever
found thee."</p>
            <p>Spalatro liſtened in gloomy attention,
and the Monk proceeded, "It is late;
go, thereſore, to her chamber; be certain
that ſhe ſleeps. Take this," he added,
"and this," giving him a dagger and a
large cloak—"You know how you are to
uſe them."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0247200302:285"/>
He pauſed, and fixed his penetrating
eyes on Spalatro, who held up the dagger
in ſilence, examined the blade, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to gaze upon it, with a vacant ſtare,
as if he was unconſcious of what he did.</p>
            <p>"You know your buſineſs," repeated
Schedoni, authoritatively, "diſpatch! time
wears; and I muſt ſet off early."</p>
            <p>The man made no reply.</p>
            <p>"The morning dawns already," ſaid the
Confeſſor, ſtill more urgently, "Do you
faulter? do you tremble? Do I not know
you?"</p>
            <p>Spalatro put up the poinard in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
without ſpeaking, threw the cloak
over his arm, and moved with a loitering
ſtep towards the door.</p>
            <p>"Diſpatch!" repeated the Confeſſor,
"why do you linger?"</p>
            <p>"I cannot ſay I like this buſineſs,
Signor," ſaid Spalatro ſurlily. "I know
not why I ſhould always do the moſt, and
be paid the leaſt."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0247200302:286"/>
"Sordid villain!" exclaimed Schedoni,
"you are not ſatisfied then!"</p>
            <p>"No more a villain than yourſelf,
Signor," retorted the man, throwing down
the cloak, "I only do your buſinſs; and
'tis you that are ſordid, for you would
take all the reward, and I would only have
a poor man have his dues. Do the work
yourſelf, or give me the greater profit."</p>
            <p>"Peace!" ſaid Schedoni, "dare no
more to inſult me with the mention of
reward. Do you imagine I have ſold
myſelf! 'Tis my will that ſhe dies;
this is ſufficient; and for you—the price
you have aſked has been granted."</p>
            <p>"It is too little," replied Spalatro, and
beſides, I do not like the work.—What
harm has ſhe done me?"</p>
            <p>"Since when is it, that you have taken
upon you to moralize?" ſaid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
"and how long are theſe cowardly
ſcruples to laſt? This is not the firſt
time you have been employed; what harm
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0247200302:287"/>
had others done you! You forget that I
know you, you forget the paſt."</p>
            <p>"No, Signer, I remember it too well, I
wiſh I could forget; I remember it too
well.—I have never been at peace ſince.
The bloody hand is always before me!
and often of a night, when the ſea roars,
and ſtorms ſhake the houſe, <hi>they</hi> have
come, all gaſned as I left them, and ſtood
before my bed! I have got up, and ran
out upon the ſhore for ſafety!"</p>
            <p>"Peace!" repeated the Confeſſor,
"where is this frenzy of fear to end? To
what are theſe viſions, painted in blood, to
lead? I thought I was talking with a
man, but find I am ſpeaking only to a
baby, poſſeſſed with his nurſe's dreams!
Yet I underſtand you,—you ſhall be
ſatisfied."</p>
            <p>Schedoni, however, had for once miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
this man, when he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it poſſible that he was really averſe to
execute what he had undertaken. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0247200302:288"/>
the innocence and beauty of Ellena
had ſoftened his heart, or that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
did torture him for his paſt deeds,
he perſiſted in refuſing to murder her.
His conſcience, or his pity, was of a very
peculiar kind however; for, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to execute the deed himſelf, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to wait at the foot of a back ſtair-caſe,
that communicated with Ellena's chamber,
while Schedoni accomplished it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to aſſiſt in carrying the body to the
ſhore. "This is a compromiſe between
conſcience and guilt, worthy of a demons,"
muttered Schedoni, who appeared to be
inſenſible that he had made the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe
with himſelf not an hour before;
and whoſe extreme reluctance at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to perpetrate with his own hand,
what he had willingly deſigned for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ought to have reminded him of that
compromiſe.</p>
            <p>Spalatro, releaſed from the immediate
office of an executioner, endured ſilently
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0247200302:289"/>
the abuſive, yet half-ſtifled, indignation
of the Confeſſor, who alſo bade him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that, though he now ſhrunk from
the moſt active part of this tranſaction, he
had not always been reſtained, in offices of
the ſame nature, by equal compunction;
and that not only his means of ſubſiſtence,
but his very life itſelf, was at his mercy.
Spalatro readily acknowledged that it was
ſo; and Schedoni knew, too well, the
truth of what he had urged, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
from his purpoſe, by any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the conſequence of a diſcovery
from this ruffian.</p>
            <p>"Give me the dagger, then," ſaid the
Confeſſor, after a long pauſe, "take up the
cloak, and follow to the ſtair-cafe. Let me
ſee, whether your valour will carry you
thus far."</p>
            <p>Spalatro reſigned the ſtiletto, and threw
the cloak again over his arm. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
ſtepped to the door, and, trying to
open it, "It is faſtened!" ſaid he in alarm,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0247200302:290"/>
"ſome perſon has got into the houſe,—it
is faſtened!"</p>
            <p>"That well may be, Signor," replied
Spalatro, calmly, "for I ſaw you bolt it
yourſelf, after I came into the room."</p>
            <p>"True," ſaid Schedoni, recovering
himſelf; "that is true."</p>
            <p>He opened it, and proceeded along the
ſilent paſſages, towards the private ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
often pauſing to liſten, and then
ſtepping more lightly;—the terrific Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
in this moment of meditative guilt,
feared even the feeble Ellena. At the
foot of the ſtair-cafe, he again ſtopped to
liſten. "Do you hear any thing?" ſaid
he in a whiſper.</p>
            <p>"I hear only the ſea," replied the man.</p>
            <p>"Huſh! it is ſomething more!" ſaid
Schedoni; "that is the murmur of
voices!"</p>
            <p>They were ſilent. After a pauſe of
ſome length, "It is, perhaps, the voice of
the ſpectres I told you of, Signor," ſaid
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0247200302:291"/>
Spalatro, with a ſneer. "Give me the
dagger," ſaid Schedoni.</p>
            <p>Spalatro, inſtead of obeying, now graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the arm of the Confeſſor, who, looking
at him for an explanation of this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
action, was ſtill more ſurpriſed to
obſerve the paleneſs and horror of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
His ſtarting eyes ſeemed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ſome object along the paſſage, and
Schedoni, who began to partake of his feek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
looked forward to diſcover what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
this diſmay, but could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any thing that juſtified it. "What
is it you fear?" ſaid he at length.</p>
            <p>Spalatro's eyes were ſtill moving in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
"Do you ſee nothing!" ſaid he point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Schedoni looked again, but did not
diſtinguiſh any object: in the remote gloom
of the paſſage, whither Spalatro's ſight was
now fixed.</p>
            <p>"Come, come," ſaid he, aſhamed of
his own weakneſs, "this is not a moment
for ſuch fancies. Awake from this idle
dream."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0247200302:292"/>
Spalatro withdrew his eyes, but they
retained all their wildneſs. "It was no
dream," ſaid lie, in the voice of a man
who is exhauſted by pain, and begins to
breathe ſomewhat more freely again. "I
ſaw it as plainly as I now ſee you."</p>
            <p>"Dotard! what did you ſee!" enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Confeſſor.</p>
            <p>"It came before my eyes in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſhewed itſelf diſtinctly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread."</p>
            <p>"What ſhewed itſelf?" repeated Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni.</p>
            <p>"And then it beckoned—yes, it beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
me, with that blood-ſtained finger!
and glided away down the paſſage, ſtilll
beckoning—till it was loſt in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
            <p>"This is very frenzy!" ſaid Schedoni,
exceſſively agitated. "Arouſe yourſelf,
and be a man!"</p>
            <p>"Frenzy! would it were, Signor. I
ſaw that dreadful hand—I ſee it now—it
is there again!—there!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0247200302:293"/>
Schedoni, ſhocked, embarraſſed, and
once more infected with the ſtrange emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Spalatro, looked forward expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to diſcover ſome terrific object, but ſtill
nothing was viſible to him, and he ſoon
recovered himſelf ſufficiently to endeavour
to appeaſe the fancy of this conscience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck
ruffian. But Spalatro was inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to all he could urge, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
fearing that his voice, though weak
and ſtifled, would awaken Ellena, tried to
withdraw him from the ſpot, to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they had quitted.</p>
            <p>"The wealth of San Loretto ſhould not
make me go that way. Signor," replied he,
ſhuddering—"that was the way <hi>it.</hi> beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
it vaniſhed that way!"</p>
            <p>Every emotion now yielded with Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
to that of apprehenſion leſt Ellena,
being awakened, ſhould make his taſk
more horrid by a ſtruggle, and his embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment
encreaſed at each inſtant, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
command, menace, or entreaty could
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0247200302:294"/>
prevail with Spalatro to retire, till the Monk
luckily remembered a door, which opened
beyond the ſtair-caſe, and would conduct
them by another way to the oppoſite
ſide of the houſe. The man conſented
ſo to depart, when, Schedoni unlock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſuit of rooms, of which he had
always kept the keys, they paſſed in ſilence
through an extent of deſolate chambers,
till they reached the one, which they had
lately left.</p>
            <p>Here, relieved from apprehenſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
Ellena, the Confeſſor expoſtulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more freely with Spalatro, but neither
argument or menace could prevail, and the
man perſiſted in refuſing to return to the
ſtair-caſe, though proteſting, at the ſame
time, that he would not remain alone in
any part of the houſe; till the wine, with
which the Confeſſor abundantly ſupplied
him, began to overcome the terrors of his
imagination. At length, his courage was
ſo much re-animated, that he conſented to
reſume his ſtation, and await at the foot
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0247200302:295"/>
of the ſtairs the accompliſhment of Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni's
dreadful errand, with which agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they returned thither by the way they
had lately paſſed. The wine, with which
Schedoni alſo had found it neceſſary to
ſtrengrhen his own reſolution, did not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him from ſevere emotion, when he
found himſelf again near Ellena; but he
made a ſtrenuous effort for ſelf-ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as he demanded the dagger of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro.</p>
            <p>"You have it already, Signor," replied
the man.</p>
            <p>"True," ſaid the Monk; "aſcend
ſoftly, or our ſteps may awaken her."</p>
            <p>"You ſaid I was to wait at the foot of
the ſtairs, Signor, while you"—</p>
            <p>"True, true, true!" muttered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
and had begun to aſcend, when his
attendant deſired him to ſtop. "You
are going in darkneſs, Signor, you have
forgotten the lamp. I have another
here."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0247200302:296"/>
Schedoni took it angrily, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and was again aſcending, when he he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated,
and once more pauſed. "The
glare will diſturb her," thought he, "it is
better to go in darkneſs.—Yet—". He
conſidered, that he could not ſtrike with
certainty without light to direct his hand,
and he kept the lamp, but returned once
more to charge Spalatro not to ſtir from
the foot of the ſtairs till he called, and
to aſcend to the chamber upon the firſt
ſignal.</p>
            <p>"I will obey, Signor, if you, on your
part, will promiſe not to give the ſignal
till all is over."</p>
            <p>"I do promiſe," replied Schedoni. "No
more!"</p>
            <p>Again he, aſcended, nor ſtopped till he
reached Ellena's door, where he liſtened
for a ſound; but all was as ſilent as if
death already reigned in the chamber.
This door was, from long diſuſe, difficult
to be opened; formerly it would have
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0247200302:297"/>
yielded without ſound, but now Schedoni
was fearful of noiſe from every effort he
made to move it. After ſome difficulty,
however, it gave way, and he perceived,
by the ſtilneſs within the apartment, that
he had not diſturbed Ellena. He ſhaded
the lamp with the door for a moment,
while he threw an enquiring glance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and when he did venture farther,
held part of his dark drapery before the
light, to prevent the rays from ſpreading
through the room.</p>
            <p>As he approached the bed, her gentle
breathings informed him that ſhe ſtill
ſlept, and the next moment he was at her
ſide. She lay in deep and peaceful ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and ſeemed to have thrown herſelf
upon the mattreſs, after having been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by her griefs; for, though ſleep preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
heavily on her eyes, their lids were yet
wet with tears.</p>
            <p>While Schedoni gazed for a moment
upon her innocent countenance, a faint
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0247200302:298"/>
ſmile ſtole over it. He ſtepped back. "She
ſmiles in her murderer's face!" ſaid he,
ſhuddering, "I muſt be ſpeedy."</p>
            <p>He ſearched for the dagger, and it was
ſome time before his trembling hand could
diſengage it from the folds of his garment;
but, having done ſo, he again drew near,
and prepared to ſtrike. Her dreſs perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; it would interrupt the blow, and
he ſtooped to examine whether he could
turn her robe aſide, without waking her.
As the light paſſed over her face, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that the ſmile had vaniſhed—the
viſions of her ſleep were changed, for tears
ſtole from beneath her eye-lids, and her
features ſuffered a ſlight convulſion. She
ſpoke! Schedoni, apprehending that the
light had diſturbed her, ſuddenly drew
back, and, again irreſolute, ſhaded the
lamp, and concealed himſelf behind the
curtain, while he liſtened. But her words
were inward and indiſtinct, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him that ſhe ſtill ſlumbered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0247200302:299"/>
His agitation and repugnance to ſtrike
encreaſed with every moment of delay, and,
as often as he prepared to plunge the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard
in her boſom, a ſhuddering horror
reſtrained him. Aſtoniſhed at his own
feelings, and indignant at what he termed
a daſtardly weakneſs, he found it neceſſary
to argue with himſelf, and his rapid
thoughts ſaid, "Do I not feel the neceſſity
of this act! Does not what is dearer to
me than exiſtence—does not my conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
depend on the execution of it? Is
ſhe not alſo beloved by the young Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di?—have
I already forgotten the church
of the Spirito Santo?" This conſideration
re-animated him; vengeance nerved his
arm, and drawing aſide the lawn from her
boſom, he once more raiſed it to ſtrike;
when, aſter gazing for an inſlant, ſome new
cauſe of horror ſeemed to ſeize all his frame,
aud he ſtood for ſome moments aghaſt
and motionleſs like a ſtatue. His reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
was ſhort and laborious, chilly drops
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0247200302:300"/>
ſtood on his forehead, and all his faculties
of mind ſeemed ſuſpended. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
he ſtooped to examine again the
miniature, which had occaſioned this revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and which had lain concealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the lawn that he withdrew. The
terrible certainty was almoſt confirmed,
and forgetting, in his impatience to know
the truth, the imprudence of ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
himſelf to Ellena at this hour of
the night and with a dagger at his feet,
he called loudly "Awake! awake! Say,
what is your name? Speak! ſpeak quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!"</p>
            <p>Ellena, arouſed by a man's voice, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from her mattreſs, when, perceiving
Schedoni, and by the pale glare of the
lamp, his haggard countenance, ſhe ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſunk back on the pillow. She had
not fainted; and believing that he came
to murder her, ſhe now exerted herſelf to
plead for mercy. The energy of her feelings
enabled her to riſe and throw herſelf at
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0247200302:301"/>
his feet, "Be merciful, O father! be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!"
ſaid ſhe, in a trembling voice.</p>
            <p>"Father!" interrupted Schedoni, with
earneſtneſs; and then, ſeeming to reſtrain
himſelf, he added, with unaffected ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,"
Why are you thus terrified?" for he
had loſt, in new intereſts and emotions, all
conſciouſneſs of evil intention, and of the
ſingularity of his ſituation. "What do
you fear?" he repeated.</p>
            <p>"Have pity, holy father!" exclaimed
Ellena in agony.</p>
            <p>"Why do you not ſay whoſe portrait
that is?" demanded he, forgetting that
he had not aſked the queſtion before.</p>
            <p>"Whoſe portrait!" repeated the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
in a loud voice.</p>
            <p>"Whoſe portrait!" ſaid Ellena, with
extreme ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p>"Ay, how came you by it? Be quick
—whoſe reſemblance is it?"</p>
            <p>"Why ſhould you wiſh to know?"
ſaid Ellena.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:0247200302:302"/>
"Anſwer my queſtion," repeated Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
with encreaſing ſternneſs.</p>
            <p>"I cannot part with it, holy father,"
replied Ellena, preſſing it to her boſom,
"you do not wiſh me to part with
it!"</p>
            <p>"Is it impoſſible to make you anſwer my
queſtion!" ſaid he, in extreme perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and turning away from her, "has
fear utterly confounded you!" Then,
again ſtepping towards her, and ſeizing
her wriſt, he repeated the demand in a
tone of deſperation.</p>
            <p>"Alas! he is dead! or I ſhould not now
want a protector," replied Ellena, ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his graſp, and weeping.</p>
            <p>"You trifle," ſaid Schedoni, with a
terrible look, "I once more demand an
anſwer—whoſe picture?"—</p>
            <p>Ellena lifted it, gazed upon it for a
moment, and then preſſing it to her lips
ſaid, "This was my father."</p>
            <p>"Your father!" he repeated in an inward
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0247200302:303"/>
voice, "your father!" and ſhuddering,
turned away.</p>
            <p>Ellena looked at him with ſurpriſe.
"I never knew a father's care," ſhe ſaid,
"nor till lately did I perceive the want of
it.—But now."—</p>
            <p>"His name?" interrupted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</p>
            <p>"But now" continued Ellena—"if you
are not as a father to me—to whom can I
look for protection?"</p>
            <p>"His name? "repeated Schedoni, with
ſterner emphaſis.</p>
            <p>"It is ſacred," replied Ellena, "for he
was unfortunate!"</p>
            <p>"His name?" demanded the Confeſſor,
furiouſly.</p>
            <p>"I have promiſed to conceal it, father."</p>
            <p>"On your life, I charge you tell it;
remember, on your life!"</p>
            <p>Ellena trembled, was ſilent, and with
ſupplicating looks implored him to deſiſt
from enquiry, but he urged the queſtion
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0247200302:304"/>
more irreſiſtibly. "His name, then," ſaid
ſhe, "was Marinella."</p>
            <p>Schedoni groaned and turned away;
but in a few ſeconds, ſtruggling to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the agitation that ſhattered his
whole frame, he returned to Ellena, and
raiſed her from her knees, on which ſhe
had thrown herſelf to implore mercy.</p>
            <p>"The place of his reſidence?" ſaid; the
Monk.</p>
            <p>"It was far from hence," ſhe replied; but
he demanded an unequivocal anſwer, and
ſhe reluctantly gave one.</p>
            <p>Schedoni turned away as before, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
heavily, and paced the chamber with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpeaking; while Ellena, in her turn,
enquired the motive of his queſtions, and
the occaſion of his agitation. But he
ſeemed not to notice any thing ſhe ſaid
and, wholly given up to his feelings, was
inflexibly ſilent, while he ſtalked, with
meaſured ſteps, along the room, and his
face, half hid by his cowl, was bent towards
the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0247200302:305"/>
Ellena's terror began to yield to aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and this emotion encreaſed, when,
Schedoni approaching her, ſhe perceived
tears ſwell in his eyes, which were fixt on
her's, and his countenance ſoften from the
wild diſorder that had marked it. Still
he could not ſpeak. At length he yielded
to the fulneſs of his heart, and Schedoni,
the ſtern Schedoni, wept and ſighed!
He ſeated himſelf on the mattreſs beſide
Ellena, took her hand, which ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
attempted to withdraw, and
when he could command his voice, ſaid,
"Unhappy child!—behold your more
unhappy father!" As he concluded, his
voice was overcome by groans, and he drew
the cowl entirely over his face.</p>
            <p>"My father!" exclaimed the aſtoniſhed
and doubting Ellena—"my father!" and
fixed her eyes upon him. He gave no
reply, but when, a moment after, he lifted
his head, "Why do you reproach me with
thoſe looks!" ſaid the conſcious Schedoni.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0247200302:306"/>
"Reproach you!—reproach my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!"
repeated Ellena, in accents ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into tenderneſs, <hi>Why</hi> ſhould I reproach
my father!"</p>
            <p>"<hi>Why!</hi>". exclaimed Schedoni, ſtarting
from his feat, "Great God!"</p>
            <p>As he moved, he ſtumbled over the
dagger at his foot; at that moment it
might be ſaid to ſtrike into his heart. He
puſhed it haſtily from ſight. Ellena had
not obſerved it; but ſhe obſerved his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
breaſt, his diſtracted looks, and
quick ſteps, as he walked to and fro in the
chamber; and ſhe aſked, with the moſt
ſoothing accents of compaſſion, and looks
of anxious gentleneſs, what made him ſo
unhappy, and tried to aſſuage his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
They ſeemed to encreaſe with every
wiſh ſhe expreſſed to diſpel them; at one
moment he would pauſe to gaze upon her,
and in the next would quit her with a
frenzied ſtart.</p>
            <p>"Why do you look ſo piteouſly upon
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0247200302:307"/>
me, father?" Ellena ſaid, "why are you
ſo unhappy? Tell me, that I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you."</p>
            <p>This appeal renewed all the violence of
remorſe and grief, and he preſſed her to his
boſom, and wetted her cheek with his
tears. Ellena wept to ſee him weep, till
her doubts began to take alarm. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
might be the proofs, that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
Schedoni of the relationſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, he had not explained theſe to
her, and, however ſtrong was the eloquence
of nature which ſhe witneſſed, it was not
ſufficient to juſtify an entire confidence in
the aſſertion he had made, or to allow her
to permit his careſſes without trembling.
She ſhrunk, and endeavoured to diſengage
herſelf; when, immediately underſtanding
her, he ſaid, "Can you doubt the cauſe of
theſe emotions? theſe ſigns of paternal
affection?"</p>
            <p>"Have I not reaſon to doubt," replied
Ellena, timidly, "ſince I never witneſſed
them before?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0247200302:308"/>
He withdrew his arms, and, fixing his
eyes earneſtly on hers, regarded her for
ſome moments in expreſſive ſilence
"Poor Innocent!" ſaid he, at length,
"you know not how much your words
convey!—It is too true, you never
have known a father's tenderneſs till
now!"</p>
            <p>His countenance darkened while he
ſpoke, and he roſe again from his ſeat.
Ellena, meanwhile, aſtoniſhed, terrified
and oppreſſed by a variety of emotions,
had no power to demand his reaſons for
the belief that ſo much agitated him, or
any explanation of his conduct; but ſhe
appealed to the portrait, and endeavoured,
by tracing ſome reſemblance between it
and Schedoni, to decide her doubts.
The countenance of each was as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in character as in years. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niature
diſplayed a young man rather
handſome, of a gay and ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
yet the ſmile expreſſed triumph,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0247200302:309"/>
rather than ſweetneſs, and his whole air
and features were diſtinguiſhed by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
of ſuperiority that role even to
haughtineſs.</p>
            <p>Schedoni, on the contrary, advanced in
years, exhibited a ſevere phyſiognomy,
furrowed by thought, no leſs than by
time, and darkened by the habitual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
of moroſe paſſions. He looked
as if he had never ſmiled ſince the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait
was drawn; and it ſeemed as if the
painter, prophetic of Schedoni's future
diſpoſition, had arreſted and embodied
that ſmile, to prove hereafter that cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
had once played upon his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Though the expreſſion was ſo different
between the countenance, which Schedoni
formerly owned, and that he now wore,
the ſame character of haughty pride was
viſible in both; and Ellena did trace a
reſemblance in the bold outline of the
features, but not ſufficient to convince
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0247200302:310"/>
her, without farther evidence, that each
belonged to the ſame perſon, and that
the Confeſſor had ever been the young
cavalier in the portrait. In the firſt
tumult of her thoughts, ſhe had not had
leiſure to dwell upon the ſingularity of
Schedoni's viſiting her at this deep hour
of the night, or to urge any queſtions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
vague ones, concerning the truth of
her relationſhip to him. But now, that
her mind was ſomewhat recollected, and
that his looks were leſs terrific, ſhe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to aſk a fuller explanation of theſe
circumſtances, and his reaſons for the
late extraordinary aſſertion. "It is paſt
midnight, father," ſaid Ellena, "you
may judge then how anxious I am to
learn, what motive led you to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at this lonely hour?"</p>
            <p>Schedoni made no reply.</p>
            <p>"Did you come to warn me of
danger?" ſhe continued, "had you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the cruel deſigns of Spalatro?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0247200302:311"/>
Ah! when I ſupplicated for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on the ſhore this evening, you
little thought what perils ſurrounded
me! or you would—"</p>
            <p>"You ſay true!" interrupted he, in
a hurried manner, "but name the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
no more. Why will you perſiſt in
returning to it?"</p>
            <p>His words ſurprized Ellena, who had
not even alluded to the ſubject till now;
but the returning wildneſs of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
made her fearful of dwelling
upon the topic, even ſo far as to point
out his error.</p>
            <p>Another deep pauſe ſucceeded, during
which Schedoni continued to pace the
room, ſometimes ſtopping for an inſtant,
to fix his eyes on Ellena, and regarding
her with an earneſtneſs that ſeemed to
partake of frenzy, and then gloomily
withdrawing his regards, and ſighing
heavily, as he turned away to a diſtant
part of the room. She, meanwhile, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0247200302:312"/>
with aſtoniſhment at his conduct,
as well as at her own circumſtances, and
with the fear of offending him by further
queſtions, endeavoured to ſummon courage
to ſolicit the explanation which was ſo
important to her tranquillity. At length
ſhe aſked, how ſhe might venture to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a circumſtance ſo ſurpriſing, as that
of which he had juſt aſſured her, and to
remind him that he had not yet diſcloſed
his reaſon for admitting the belief.</p>
            <p>The Confeſſor's feelings were eloquent
in reply; and, when at length they were
ſufficiently ſubdued, to permit him to
talk coherently, he mentioned ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
concerning Ellena's family,
that proved him at leaſt to have been
intimately acquainted with it; and others,
which ſhe believed were known only to
Bianchi and herſelf, that removed every
doubt of his identity.</p>
            <p>This, however, was a period of his
life too big with remorſe, horror, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0247200302:313"/>
the firſt pangs of parental affection, to
allow him to converſe long; deep ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
was neceſſary for his ſoul. He
wiſhed to plunge where no eye might
reſtrain his emotions, or obſerve the
overflowing anguiſh of his heart. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obtained ſufficient proof to convince
him that Ellena was indeed his child,
and aſſured her that ſhe ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from this houſe on the follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
day, and be reſtored to her home,
he abruptly left the chamber.</p>
            <p>As he deſcended the ſtair-caſe, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro
ſtepped forward to meet him, with
the cloak which had been deſigned to
wrap the mangled form of Ellena, when
it ſhould be carried to the ſhore. "Is
it done?" ſaid the ruffian, in a ſtifled
voice, "I am ready;" and he ſpread
forth the cloak, and began to aſcend.</p>
            <p>"Hold! villain, hold!" ſaid Schedoni,
lifting up his head for the firſt time,
"Dare to enter that chamber, and your
life ſhill anſwer for it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0247200302:314"/>
"What!" exclaimed the-man, ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back aſtoniſhed—"will not <hi>her</hi>'s ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
you!"</p>
            <p>He trembled for the conſequence of
what he had ſaid, when he obſerved the
changing countenance of the Confeſſor.
But Schedoni ſpoke not: the tumult in
his breaſt was too great for utterance, and
he preſſed haſtily forward. Spalatro fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
"Be pleaſed to tell me what I
am to do," ſaid he, again holding forth the
cloak.</p>
            <p>"Avaunt!" exclaimed the other, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fiercely upon him; "leave me."</p>
            <p>"How!" ſaid the man, whoſe ſpirit was
now arouſed, "has <hi>your</hi> courage failed too,
Signor? If ſo, I will prove myſelf no daſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,
though you called me one; I'll do
the buſineſs myſelf."</p>
            <p>"Villain! fiend!" cried Schedoni, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ruffian by the throat, with a graſp
that ſeemed intended to annihilate him;
when, recollecting that the fellow was only
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0247200302:315"/>
willing to obey the very inſtructions he
had himſelf but lately delivered to him,
other emotions ſucceeded to that of rage;
he ſlowly liberated him, and in accents
broken, and ſoftening from ſternneſs, bade
him retire to reſt. "Tomorrow," he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
"I will ſpeak further with you. As
for this night—I have changed my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Begone!"</p>
            <p>Spalatro was about to expreſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
which aſtoniſhment and fear had
hitherto, overcome, but his employer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
his command in a voice of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and cloſed the door of his apartment
with violence, as he ſhut out a man, whoſe
preſence was become hateful to him. He
felt relieved by his abſence, and began to
breathe more freely, till, remembering that
this accomplice had juſt boaſted that he
was no daſtard, he dreaded leſt, by way of
proving the aſſertion, he ſhould attempt
to commit the crime, from which he had
lately ſhrunk. Terrified at the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0247200302:316"/>
and even apprehending that it might
already have become a reality, he ruſhed
from the room, and found Spalatro in the
paſſage leading to the private ſtair-caſe;
but, whatever might have been his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
the ſituation and looks of the latter
were ſufficiently alarming. At the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Schedoni, he turned his ſullen
and malignant countenance towards him,
without anſwering the call, or the demand
as to his buſineſs there; and with ſlow
ſteps obeyed the order of his maſter, that
he ſhould withdraw to his room. Thither
Schedoni followed, and, having locked him
in it for the night, he repaired to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ellena, which he ſecured from the
poſſibility of intruſion. He then returned
to his own, not to ſleep, but to abandon
himſelf to the agonies of remorſe and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
and he yet ſhuddered like a man, who
has juſt recoiled from the brink of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice,
but who ſtill meaſures the gulf with
his eye.</p>

            <p>ELLENA, when Schedoni had left her,
recollected all the particulars, which he
had thought proper to reveal concerning
her family, and, comparing them with ſuch
circumſtances as the late Bianchi had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
on the ſame ſubject, ſhe perceived
nothing that was contradictory between the
two accounts. But ſhe knew not even yet
enough of her own ſtory, to underſtand
why Bianchi had been ſilent as to ſome
particulars, which had juſt been diſcloſed.
From Bianchi ſhe had always underſtood,
that her mother had married a nobleman
of the duchy of Milan, and of the houſe of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0247200302:318"/>
Marinella; that the marriage had been
unfortunate; and that ſhe herſelf, even
before the death of the Counteſs, had been
committed to the care of Bianchi, the only
ſiſter of that lady. Of this event, or of
her mother, Ellena had no remembrance;
for the kindneſs of Bianchi had obliterated
from her mind the loſs and the griefs of
her early infancy; and ſhe recollected
only the accident which had diſcovered
to her, in Bianchi's cabinet, after the
death of the latter, the miniature and
the name of her father. When ſhe had
enquired the reaſon of this injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Bianchi replied, that the degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fortune of her houſe rendered pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy
deſirable; and anſwered her fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
queſtions concerning her father, by
relating, that he had died while ſhe was
an infant. The picture, which Ellena
had diſcovered, Bianchi had found among
the trinkets of the departed Counteſs, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0247200302:319"/>
deſigned to preſent it at ſome future pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to. Ellena, when her diſcretion might
be truſted with a knowledge of her family.
This was the whole of what Signora Bian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi
had judged it neceſſary to explain,
though in her laſt hours it appeared that
ſhe wiſhed to reveal more; but it was
then too late.</p>
            <p>Though Ellena perceived that many
circumſtances of the relations given by
Schedoni, and by Signora Bianchi, coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
and that none were contradictory,
except that of his death, ſhe could not yet
ſubdue her amazement at this diſcovery,
or even the doubts which occasionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
to her as to it's truth. Schedoni,
on the contrary, had not even appeared
ſurpriſed, when ſhe aſſured him, that ſhe
always underſtood her father had been
dead many years; though when ſhe aſked
if her mother too was living, both his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
and his aſſurances confirmed the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made by Bianchi.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0247200302:320"/>
When Ellena's mind became more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil,
ſhe noticed again the ſingularity of
Schedoni's viſit to her apartment at ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
an hour; and her thoughts glanced
back involuntarily to the ſcene of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
evening on the ſea-ſhore, and the
image of her father appeared in each, in
the terrific character of an agent of the
Marcheſa di Vivaldi. The ſuſpicions,
however, which ſhe had formerly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
reſpecting his deſigns, were new impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
rejected, for ſhe was leſs anxious to
diſcover truth, than to releaſe herſelf from
horrible ſuppoſitions; and ſhe willingly
believed that Schedoni, having miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
her character, had only deſigned to
aſſiſt in removing her beyond the reach of
Vivaldi. The ingenuity of hope ſuggeſted
alſo, that, having juſt heard from her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors,
or from Spalatro, ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of her ſtory, he had been led to a
ſuſpicion of the relationſhip between them,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0247200302:321"/>
and that in the firſt impatience of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
anxiety, he had diſregarded the hour,
and come, though at midnight, to her
apartment to aſcertain the truth.</p>
            <p>While ſhe ſoothed herſelf with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of a circumſtance, which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
her conſiderable ſurpriſe, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
on the floor the point of a dagger
peeping from beneath the curtains! Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
almoſt too horrible to be ſuſtained,
followed this diſcovery; ſhe took the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
and gazed upon it aghaſt and
trembling, for a ſuſpicion of the real mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Schedoni's viſit glanced upon her
mind. But it was only for a moment; ſuch
a ſuppoſition was too terrible to be willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endured; ſhe again believed that Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro
alone had meditated her deſtruction,
and ſhe thanked the Confeſſor as her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,
inſtead of ſhrinking from him as an
aſſaſſin. She now underſtood that Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
having diſcovered the ruffian's deſign,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0247200302:322"/>
had ruſhed into the chamber to ſave a
ſtranger from his murderous poniard, and
had unconſciouſly reſcued his own daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when the portrait at her boſom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him of the truth. With this
conviction Ellena's eyes overflowed with
gratitude, and her heart was huſhed to peace.</p>
            <p>Schedoni, meanwhile, ſhut up in his
chamber, was agitated by feelings of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
oppoſite nature. When their firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
was exhauſted, and his mind was
calm enough to reflect, the images that
appeared on it ſtruck him with ſolemn
wonder. In purſuing Ellena at the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
inſtigation of the Marcheſa di Vivaldi,
it appeared that he had been perſecuting
his own child; and in thus conſenting to
conſpire againſt the innocent, he had in the
event been only puniſhing the guilty, and
preparing mortification for himſelf on the
exact ſubject to which he had ſacrificed
his conſcience. Every ſtep that he had
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0247200302:323"/>
taken with a view of gratifying his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was retrograde, and while he had been
wickedly intent to ſerve the Marcheſa and
himſelf, by preventing the marriage of
Vivaldi and Ellena, he had been laboriousſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
counteracting his own fortune. An alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the illuſtrious houſe of Vivaldi,
was above his loftieſt hope of advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and this event he had himſelf nearly
prevented by the very means which had
been adoped, at the expence of every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
conſideration, to obtain an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
promotion. Thus by a ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
his own crimes had recoiled
upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>Schedoni perceived the many obſtacles,
which lay between him and his newly
awakened hopes, and that much was to be
overcome before thoſe nuptials could be
publicly ſolemnized, which he was now
ſtill more anxious to promote, than he
had lately been to prevent. The appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the Marcheſa was, at leaſt, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0247200302:324"/>
for ſhe had much at her diſpoſal, and
without it, though his daughter might be
the wife of Vivaldi, he himſelf would be no
otherwiſe benefited at preſent than by the
honour of the connection. He had ſome
peculiar reaſons for believing, that her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
might be obtained, and, though there
was hazard in delaying the nuptials till
ſuch an experiment had been made, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to encounter it, rather than forbear
to ſolicit her concurrence. But, if the
Marcheſa ſhould prove inexorable, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to beſtow the hand of Ellena,
without her knowledge, and in doing ſo,
he well knew that he incurred little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from her reſentment, ſince he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
in his poſſeſſion, the conſciouſneſs of
which muſt awe her into a ſpeedy neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The conſent of the Marcheſe, as he
deſpaired of obtaining it, he did not mean
to ſolicit, and the influence of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa
was ſuch, that Schedoni did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that as eſſential.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:0247200302:325"/>
The firſt ſteps, however, to be taken,
were thoſe that might releaſe Vivaldi from
the Inquiſition, the tremendous priſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which Schedoni himſelf, little foreſeeing
that he ſhould ſo ſoon wiſh for his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
had cauſed him to be thrown. He
had always underſtoood, indeed, that if
the Informer forbore to appear againſt the
Accuſed in this Court, the latter would
of courſe be liberated; and he alſo believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Vivaldi's freedom could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
whenever he ſhould think proper to
apply to a perſon at Naples, whom he
knew to be connected with the <hi>Holy Office</hi>
of Rome. How much the Confeſſor had
ſuffered his wiſhes to deceive him, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
hereafter. His motives for having
thus confined Vivaldi, were partly thoſe
of ſelf-defence. He dreaded the diſcovery
and the vengeance, which might follow the
loſs of Ellena, ſhould Vivaldi be at liberty
immediately to purſue his enquiries. But
he believed that all trace of her muſt be
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0247200302:326"/>
loſt, after a few weeks had elapſed, and
that Vivaldi's ſufferings from confinement
in the Inquiſition would have given inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
to his mind, which muſt weaken the
one he felt for Ellena. Yet, though in
this inſtance ſelf-defence had been a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
motive with Schedoni, a deſire of
revenging the inſult he had received in
the church of the Spirito Santo, and all
the conſequent mortifications he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced,
had been a ſecond; and, ſuch was
the blackneſs of his hatred, and the avarice
of his revenge, that he had not conſidered
the ſuffering, which the loſs of Ellena would
occaſion Vivaldi, as ſufficient retaliation.</p>
            <p>In adopting a mode of puniſhment ſo
extraordinary as that of impriſonment in
the Inquiſition, it appears, therefore, that
Schedoni was influenced, partly by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of otherwiſe confining Vivaldi, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the period for which confinement was
abſolutely neceſſary to the ſucceſs of his
own ſchemes, and partly by a deſire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0247200302:327"/>
the tortures of terror. He had
alſo been encouraged by his diſcovery of
this opportunity for conferring new obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
on the Marcheſa. The very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
that muſt have appeared to the firſt
glance of an honeſt mind fatal to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
he thought might be rendered
beneficial to them, and that his dexterity
could ſo command the buſineſs, as that the
Marcheſa ſhould eventually thank him
as the deliverer of her ſon, inſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
and execrating him as his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer;
a ſcheme favoured by the unjuſt and
cruel rule enacted by the tribunal he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
which permitted anonymous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers.</p>
            <p>To procure the arreſtation of Vivaldi, it
had been only neceſſary to ſend a written
accuſation, without a name, to the <hi>Holy
Office,</hi> with a mention of the place where
the accuſed perſon might be ſeized; but
the ſuffering in conſequence of this did
not always proceed further than the <hi>queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;.</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0247200302:328"/>
ſince, if the Informer failed to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himſelf to the Inquiſitors, the priſoner,
after many examinations, was releaſed,
unleſs he happened unwarily to criminate
himſelf. Schedoni, as he did not intend
to proſecute, believed, therefore, that
Vivaldi would of courſe be diſcharged
after a certain period, and ſuppoſing it
alſo utterly impoſſible that he could
ever diſcover his Accuſer, the Confeſſor
determined to appear anxious and active
in effecting his releaſe. This character of
a deliverer, he knew he ſhould be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enabled to ſupport by means of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
officially connected with the <hi>Holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
who had already unconſciouſly aſſiſted
his views. In the apartment of this man,
Schedoni had accidentally ſeen a formula
of arreſtation againſt a perſon ſuſpected of
Hereſy, the view of which had not only
ſuggeſted to him the plan he had ſince
adopted, but had in ſome degree aſſiſted
him to carry it into effect. He had ſeen
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0247200302:329"/>
the ſcroll only for a ſhort time, but his
obſervations were ſo minute, and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
ſo clear, that he was able to copy
it with at leaſt ſufficient exactneſs to impoſe
upon the Benedictine prieſt, who had,
perhaps, ſeldom or never ſeen a real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of this kind. Schedoni had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
this artifice for the purpoſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſecuring Vivaldi, apprehending
that, while the Inquiſitors were ſlowly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating
upon his arreſt, he might quit
Celano, and elude diſcovery. If the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caption
ſucceeded, it would enable him
alſo to ſeize Ellena, and to miſlead Vivaldi
reſpecting her deſtination. The charge of having
carried off a nun might appear to
be corroborated by many circumſtances,
and Schedoni would probably have made
theſe the ſubject of real denunciation, had
he not foreſeen the danger and the trouble
in which it might implicate himſelf; and
that, as the charge could not be ſubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,
Ellena would finally eſcape. As
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0247200302:330"/>
far as his plan now went, it had been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful;
ſome of the bravoes whom he
hired to perſonate officials, had conveyed
Vivaldi to the town, where the real officers
of the Inquiſition were appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him; while the others carried Ellena
to the ſhore of the Adriatic. Schedoni
had much applauded his own ingenuity, in
thus contriving, by the matter of the
forged accuſation, to throw an impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
veil over the fate of Ellena, and to
ſecure himſelf from the ſuſpicions or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of Vivaldi, who, it appeared, would
always believe that ſhe had died, or was
ſtill confined in the unſearchable priſons
of the Inquiſition.</p>
            <p>Thus he had betrayed himſelf in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to betray Vivaldi, whoſe releaſe,
however, he yet ſuppoſed could be eaſily
obtained; but how much his policy
had, in this inſtance, outrun his ſagacity,
now remained to be proved.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of Schedoni's immediate
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0247200302:331"/>
perplexity was, the difficulty of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ellena back to Naples; ſince, not chuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to appear at preſent in the character
of her father, he could not decorouſly
accompany her thither himſelf, nor could
he prudently entruſt her to the conduct
of any perſon, whom he knew in this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.
It was, however, neceſſary to
form a ſpeedy determination, for he could
neither endure to paſs another day in a
ſcene, which muſt continually impreſs him
with the horrors of the preceding night,
nor that Ellena ſhould remain in it; and
the morning light already gleamed upon
his caſements.</p>
            <p>After ſome further deliberation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to be himſelf her conductor, as far
at leaſt as through the foreſts of the Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
and at the firſt town where conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
could be procured, to throw aſide
his Monk's habit, and, aſſuming the dreſs
of a layman, accompany her in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
towards Naples, till he ſhould either
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0247200302:332"/>
diſcover ſome ſecure means of ſending her
forward to that city, or a temporary aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
for her in a convent on the way.</p>
            <p>His mind was ſcarcely more tranquil,
after having formed this determination,
than before, and he did not attempt to
repoſe himſelf even for a moment. The
circumſtances of the late diſcovery were
almoſt perpetually recurring to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
conſcience, accompanied by a
fear that Ellena might ſuſpect the real
purpoſe of his midnight viſit; and he
alternately formed and rejected plauſible
falſehoods, that might aſſuage her curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and delude her apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>The hour arrived, however, when it
was neceſſary to prepare for departure,
and found him ſtill undecided as to the
explanation he ſhould form.</p>
            <p>Having releaſed Spalatro from his
chamber, and given him directions to
procure horſes and a guide immediately
from the neighbouring hamlet, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0247200302:333"/>
to Ellena's room, to prepare her
for this haſty removal. On approaching
it, a remembrance of the purpoſe, with
which he had laſt paſſed through theſe ſame paſſages and ſtair-caſe, appealed ſo
powerfully to his feelings, that he was
unable to proceed, and he turned back
to his own apartment to recover ſome
command over himſelf. A few moments
reſtored to him his uſual addreſs, though
not his tranquillity, and he again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
the chamber; it was now, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
by way of the corridor. As he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
the door, his hand trembled; but,
when he entered the room, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and manner had reſumed their uſual
ſolemnity, and his voice only would have
betrayed, to an attentive obſerver, the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his mind.</p>
            <p>Ellena was conſiderably affected on
ſeeing him again, and he examined with
a jealous eye the emotions he witneſſed.
The ſmile with which ſhe met him was
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0247200302:334"/>
tender, but he perceived it paſs away
from her features, like the aërial colouring
that illumines a mountain's brow; and
the gloom of doubt and apprehenſion again
overſpread them. As he advanced, he held
forth his hand for her's, when, ſuddenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the dagger he had left in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he involuntarily withdrew his prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
courteſy, and his countenance chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Ellena, whoſe eyes followed his to the
object that attracted them, pointed to the
inſtrument, took it up, and approaching
him ſaid, "This dagger I found laſt
night in my chamber! O my father!"—</p>
            <p>"That dagger!" ſaid Schedoni, with
affected ſurprize.</p>
            <p>"Examine it," continued Ellena, while
ſhe held it up, "Do you know to whom
it belongs? and who brought it hither?"</p>
            <p>"What is it you mean?" aſked Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
betrayed by his feelings.</p>
            <p>"Do you know, too, for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0247200302:335"/>
it was brought?" ſaid Ellena mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>The Confeſſor made no reply, but irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
attempted to ſeize the inſtrument.</p>
            <p>"O yes, I perceive you know too
well," continued Ellena, "here, my
father, while I ſlept"—</p>
            <p>"Give me the dagger," interrupted
Schedoni, in a frightful voice.</p>
            <p>"Yes, my father, I will give it as an
offering of my gratitude," replied Ellena,
but as ſhe raiſed her eyes, filled with
tears, his look and fixed attitude terrified
her, and ſhe added with a ſtill more perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
tenderneſs, "Will you not accept the
offering of your child, for having preſerved
her from the poniard of an aſſaſſin?"</p>
            <p>Schedoni's looks became yet darker;
he took the dagger in ſilence, and threw
it with violence to the furtheſt end of
the chamber, while his eyes remained
fixed on her's. The force of the action
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0247200302:336"/>
alarmed her; "Yes, it is in vain that
you would conceal the truth," ſhe added,
weeping unreſtrainedly, "your goodneſs
cannot avail; I know the whole."—</p>
            <p>The laſt words arouſed Schedoni again
from his trance, his features became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed,
and his look furious."What
do you know?" he demanded in a
ſubdued voice, that ſeemed ready to
burſt in thunder.</p>
            <p>"All that I owe you," replied Ellena,
"that laſt night, while I ſlept upon this
mattreſs, unſuſpicious of what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
againſt me, an aſſaſſin entered the
chamber with that inſtrument in his
hand, and—"</p>
            <p>A ſtiſled groan from Schedoni checked
Ellena; ſhe obſerved his rolling eyes, and
trembled; till, believing that his agitation
was occaſioned by indignation againſt the
aſſaſſin, ſhe reſumed, "Why ſhould you
think it neceſſary to conceal the danger
which has threatened me, ſince it is to you
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0247200302:337"/>
that I owe my deliverance from it? O!
my father, do not deny me the pleaſure
of ſhedding theſe tears of gratitude, do
not refuſe the thanks, which are due to
you! While I ſlept upon that couch,
while a ruffian ſtole upon my ſlumber—it
was you, yes! can I ever forget that
it was my father, who ſaved me from his
poniard!"</p>
            <p>Schedoni's paſſions were changed, but
they were not leſs violent; he could
ſcarcely controul them, while he ſaid in
a tremulous tone—"It is enough, ſay
no more;" and he raiſed Ellena, but
turned away without embracing her.</p>
            <p>His ſtrong emotion, as he paced in
ſilence the furtheſt end of the apartment,
excited her ſurprize, but ſhe then attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
it to a remembrance, of the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
moment, from which he had reſcued
her.</p>
            <p>Schedoni, meanwhile, to whom her
thanks were daggers, was trying to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0247200302:338"/>
he feelings of remorſe that tore his
heart; and was ſo enveloped in a world
of his own, as to be for ſome time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious
of all around him. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to ſtalk in gloomy ſilence along
the chamber, till the voice of Ellena,
entreating him rather to rejoice that he
had been permitted to ſave her, than ſo
deeply to conſider dangers which were paſt,
again touched the chord that vibrated to
his conſcience, and recalled him to a
ſenſe of his ſituation. He then bade her
prepare for immediate departure, and
abruptly quitted the room.</p>
            <p>Vainly hoping that in flying from the
ſcene of his meditated crime, he ſhould
leave with it the acuteneſs of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
and the agonizing ſtings of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe,
he was now more anxious than
ever to leave this place. Yet he ſhould
ſtill be accompanied by Ellena, and her
innocent looks, her affectionate thanks,
inflicted an anguiſh, which was ſcarcely
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0247200302:339"/>
endurable. Sometimes, thinking that her
hatred, or what to him would be ſtill
ſeverer, her contempt, muſt be more
tolerable than this gratitude, he almoſt
reſolved to undeceive her reſpecting his
conduct, but as conſtantly and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
repelled the thought with horror,
and finally determined to ſuffer her to
account for his late extraordinary viſit in
the way ſhe had choſen.</p>
            <p>Spalatro, at length, returned from the
hamlet with horſes, but without having
procured a guide to conduct the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
through a tract of the long-devolving
foreſts of the Garganus, which
it was neceſſary for them to paſs. No
perſon had been willing to undertake ſo
arduous a taſk; and Spalatro, who was
well acquainted with all the labyrinths
of the way, now offered his ſervices.</p>
            <p>Schedoni, though he could ſcarcely
endure the preſence of this man, had no
alternative but to accept him, ſince he
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0247200302:340"/>
had diſmiſſed the guide who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
him hither. Of perſonal violence
Schedoni had no apprehenſion, though he
too well underſtood the villainy of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
companion; for he conſidered that
he himſelf ſhould be well armed, and he
determined to aſcertain that Spalatro was
without weapons; he knew alſo, that in
caſe of a conteſt, his own ſuperior ſtature
would eaſily enable him to overcome ſuch
an antagoniſt.</p>
            <p>Every thing being now ready for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
Ellena was ſummoned, and the
Confeſſor led her to his own apartment,
where a ſlight breakfaſt was prepared.</p>
            <p>Her ſpirits being revived by the ſpeed
of this departure, ſhe would again have
expreſſed her thanks, but he peremptorily
interrupted her, and forbade any further
mention of gratitude.</p>
            <p>On entering the court where the horſes
were in waiting, and perceiving Spalatro,
Ellena ſhrunk and put her arm within
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0247200302:341"/>
Schedoni's for protection. "What recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
does the preſence of that man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive!"
ſaid ſhe, "I can ſcarcely venture to
believe myſelf ſafe, even with you, when he
is here."</p>
            <p>Schedoni made no reply, till the remark
was repeated, "You have nothing to fear
from him," muttered the Confeſſor, while
he haſtened her forward, "and we have
no time to loſe in vague apprehenſion."</p>
            <p>"How!" exclaimed Ellena, "is not
he the aſſaſſin from whom you ſaved me!
I cannot doubt, that you know him to be
ſuch, though you would ſpare me the
pain of believing ſo."</p>
            <p>"Well, well, be it ſo," replied the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor;
"Spalatro, lead the horſes this way."</p>
            <p>The party were ſoon mounted, when,
quitting this eventful manſion, and the
those of the Adriatic, as Ellena hoped for
ever, they entered upon the gloomy wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of the Garganus. She often turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her eyes back upon the houſe with
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0247200302:342"/>
emotions of inexpreſſible awe, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thankfulneſs, and gazed while
a glimpſe of it's turretted walls could be
caught beyond the dark branches, which,
cloſing over it, at length ſhut it from her
view. The joy of this departure, however,
was conſiderably abated by the preſence
of Spalatro, and her fearful countenance
enquired of Schedoni the meaning of his
being ſuffered to accompany them. The
Confeſſor was reluctant to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a man, of whoſe very exiſtence he
would willingly have ceaſed to think. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena
guided her horſe ſtill cloſer to Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni's,
but, forbearing to urge the enquiry
otherwiſe than by looks, ſhe received no
reply, and endeavoured to quiet her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
by conſidering that he would
not have permitted this man to be
their guide, unleſs he had believed he
might be truſted. This conſideration,
though it relieved her fears, encreaſed her
perplexity reſpecting the late deſigns
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0247200302:343"/>
of Spalatro, and her ſurpriſe that Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
if he had really underſtood them to
be evil, ſhould endure his preſence.
Every time ſhe ſtole a glance at the dark
countenance of this man, rendered ſtill
barker by the ſhade of the trees, ſhe
thought "aſſaſſin" was written in each
line or it, and could ſcarcely doubt that
he, and not the people who had conducted
her to the manſion, had dropped the dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in her chamber. Whenever ſhe looked
round through the deep glades, and on the
foreſt-mountains that on every ſide cloſed
the ſcene, and ſeemed to exclude all cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
haunt of man, and then regarded her
companions, her heart ſunk, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the reaſons ſhe had for believing
herſelf in the protection of a father. Nay,
the very looks of Schedoni himſelf, more
than once reminding her of his appearance
on the ſea-ſhore, renewed the impreſſions
of alarm and even of diſmay, which ſhe
had there experienced. At ſuch moments
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0247200302:344"/>
it was ſcarcely poſſible for her to conſider
him as her parent, and, in ſpite of every
late appearance, ſtrange and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
doubts began to gather on her mind.</p>
            <p>Schedoni, meanwhile, loſt in thought,
broke not, by a ſingle word, the deep
ſilence of the ſolitudes through which they
paſſed. Spalatro was equally mute, and
equally engaged by his reflections on the
ſudden change in Schedoni's purpoſe, and
by wonder as to the motive, which could
have induced him to lead Ellena in ſafety,
from the very ſpot whither ſhe was
brought by his expreſs command to be
deſtroyed. He, however, was not ſo
wholly occupied, as to be unmindful of
his ſituation, or unwatchful of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſerving his own intereſts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliating
upon Schedoni for the treatment
he had received on the preceding night.</p>
            <p>Among the various ſubjects that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
the Confeſſor, the difficulty of
diſpoſing of Ellena, without betraying at
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0247200302:345"/>
Naples that ſhe was his relative, was not
the leaſt diſtreſſing. Whatever might be
the reaſon which could juſtify ſuch feelings,
his fears of a premature diſcovery of the
circumſtance to the ſociety with whom
he lived, were ſo ſtrong, as often to
produce the moſt violent effect upon his
countenance, and it was, perhaps, when
he was occupied by this ſubject, that it's
terrific expreſſion revived with Ellena the
late ſcene upon the ſhore. His embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment
was not leſs, as to the excuſe to
be offered the Marcheſa, for having failed to
fulfil his engagement, and reſpecting
the means by which he might intereſt her in
favour of Ellena, and even diſpoſe her to
approve the marriage, before ſhe ſhould
be informed of the family of this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
young woman. Perceiving all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for aſcertaining the probabilities of
ſuch conſent, before he ventured to make
an avowal of her origin, he determined not
to reveal himſelf till he ſhould be perfectly
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0247200302:346"/>
ſure that the diſcovery would be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Marcheſa. In the mean time,
as it would be neceſſary to ſay ſomething
of Ellena's birth, he meant to declare, that
he had diſcovered it to be noble, and her
family worthy, in every reſpect, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
with that of the Vivaldi.</p>
            <p>An interview with the Marcheſa, was
almoſt equally wiſhed for and dreaded by
the Confeſſor. He ſhuddered at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of meeting a woman, who had
inſtigated him to the murder of his own
child, which, though he had been happily
prevented from committing it, was an act
that would ſtill be wiſhed for by the
Marcheſa. How could he endure her
reproaches, when ſhe ſhould diſcover that
he had failed to accompliſh her will! How
conceal the indignation of a father, and
diſſimulate all a father's various feelings,
when, in reply to ſuch reproaches, he muſt
form excuſes, and act humility, from
which his whole ſoul would revolt! Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0247200302:347"/>
could his arts of diſſimilation have
been ſo ſeverely tried, not even in the late
ſcenes with Ellena, never have returned
upon himſelf in puniſhment ſo ſevere, as
in that which awaited him with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa.
And from it's approach, the cool
and politic Schedoni often ſhrunk in ſuch
horror, that he almoſt determined to avoid
it at any hazard, and ſecretly to unite Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi
and Ellena, without even ſoliciting
the conſent of the Marcheſa.</p>
            <p>A deſire, however, of the immediate
preferment, ſo neceſſary to his pride, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
checked this ſcheme, and finally
made him willing to ſubject every honeſt
feeling, and ſubmit to any meanneſs,
however vicious, rather than forego the
favourite object of his erroneous ambition.
Never, perhaps, was the paradoxical union
of pride and abjectneſs, more ſtrongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
than on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>While thus the travellers ſilently proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Ellena's thoughts often turned to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0247200302:348"/>
and ſhe conſidered, with trembling
anxiety, the effect which the late diſcovery
was likely to have upon their future lives.
It appeared to her, that Schedoni muſt
approve of a connection thus flattering to
the pride of a father, though he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
refuſe his conſent to a private mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
And, when ſhe further conſidered
the revolution, which a knowledge of her
family might occaſion towards herſelf in the
minds of the Vivaldi, her proſpects ſeemed
to brighten, and her cares began to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate.
Judging that Schedoni muſt be
acquainted with the preſent ſituation of
Vivaldi, ſhe was continually on the point
of mentioning him, but was as conſtantly
reſtrained by timidity, though, had ſhe
ſuſpected him to be an inhabitant
of the Inquiſition, her ſcruples would
have vaniſhed before an irreſiſtible intereſt.
As it was, believing that he, like herſelf,
had been impoſed upon by the Marcheſa's
agents, in the diſguiſe of officials, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0247200302:349"/>
as has before appeared, that he
how ſuffered a temporary impriſonment
by order of his mother, at one of the
family villas. When, however, Schedoni,
awaking from his reverie, abruptly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Vivaldi, her ſpirits fluttered with
impatience to learn his exact ſituation,
and ſhe enquired reſpecting it.</p>
            <p>"I am no ſtranger to your attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,"
ſaid Schedoni, evading the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
"but I wiſh to be informed of ſome
circumſtances relative to it's commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
            <p>Ellena, confuſed, and not knowing
what to reply, was for a moment ſilent,
and then repeated her enquiry.</p>
            <p>"Where did you firſt meet?" ſaid the
Confeſſor, ſtill diſregarding her queſtion.
Ellena related, that ſhe had firſt ſeen
Vivaldi, when attending her aunt from
the church of San Lorenzo. For the
preſent ſhe was ſpared the embarraſſment
of further explanation by Spalatro, who,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0247200302:350"/>
riding up to Schedoni, informed him they
were approaching the town of Zanti. On
looking forward, Ellena perceived houſes
peeping from among the foreſt-trees, at a
ſhort diſtance, and preſently heard the
cheerful bark of a dog, that ſure herald
and faithful ſervant of man!</p>
            <p>Soon after the travellers entered Zanti,
a ſmall town ſurrounded by the foreſt,
where, however, the poverty of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
ſeemed to forbid a longer ſtay
than was abſolutely neceſſary for repoſe,
and a flight refreſhment. Spalatro led
the way to a cabin, in which the few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that journied this road were uſually
entertained. The appearance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who owned it, was as wild as their
country, and the interior of the dwelling
was ſo dirty and comfortleſs, that Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,
preferring to take his repaſt in the
open air, a table was ſpread under the
luxuriant ſhade of the foreſt-trees, at a
little diſtance. Here, when the hoſt
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0247200302:351"/>
had withdrawn, and Spalatro had been
diſpatched to examine the poſt-horſes, and
to procure a lay-habit for the Confeſſor,
the latter, once more alone with Ellena,
began to experience again ſomewhat of
the embaraſſments of conſcience; and
Ellena, whenever her eyes glanced upon
him, ſuffered a ſolemnity of fear that roſe
almoſt to terror. He, at length, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
this emphatic ſilence, by renewing
his mention of Vivaldi, and his command
that Ellena ſhould relate the hiſtory of
their affection. Not daring to refuſe, ſhe
obeyed, but with as much brevity as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and Schedoni did not interrupt her
by a ſingle obſervation. However eligible
their nuptials now appeared to him, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
to give any hint of approbation, till
he ſhould have extricated the object of her
regards from his perilous ſituation. But,
with Ellena, this very ſilence implied the
opinion it was meant to conceal, and,
encouraged by the hope it imparted, ſhe
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0247200302:352"/>
ventured once more to aſk, by whoſe order
Vivaldi had been arreſted; whither he had
been conveyed, and the circumſtances of
his preſent ſituation.</p>
            <p>Too politic to intruſt her with a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his actual condition, the Confeſſor
ſpared her the anguiſh of learning that he
was a priſoner in the Inquiſition. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
ignorance of the late tranſaction at
Celano, but ventured to believe, that both
Vivaldi and herſelf had been arreſted by
order of the Marcheſa, who, he conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
had thrown him into temporary
confinement, a meaſure which ſhe, no
doubt, had meant to enforce alſo towards
Ellena.</p>
            <p>"And you, my father," obſerved Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
"what brought you to my priſon,—you
who was not informed with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa's
deſigns? What accident conducted
you to that remote ſolitude, juſt at the
moment when you could ſave your
child!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0247200302:353"/>
"Informed of the Marcheſa's deſigns!"
ſaid Schedoni, with embarraſſment and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure:
"Have you ever imagined that
I could be acceſſary—that I could conſent
to aſſiſt, I mean could conſent to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidant
of ſuch atrocious"—Schedoni,
bewildered, confounded, and half betrayed,
checked himſelf.</p>
            <p>"Yet you have ſaid, the Marcheſa meant
only to confine me,!" obſerved Ellena;
"was that deſign ſo atrocious? Alas, my
father! I know too well that her plan was
more atrocious, and ſince you had too
much reaſon to know this, why do you
ſay that impriſonment only was intended
for me? But your ſolicitude for my tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
leads you to"—</p>
            <p>"What means," interrupted the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Schedoni, "can I particularly have
of underſtanding the Marcheſa's ſchemes?
I repeat, that I am not her confidant; how
then is it to be ſuppoſed I ſhould know
that they extended further than to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0247200302:354"/>
"Did you not ſave me from the arm of
the aſſaſſin!" ſaid Ellena tenderly; "did
not you wrench the very dagger from his
graſp!"</p>
            <p>"I had forgotten, I had forgotten," ſaid
the Conſeſſor, yet more embarraſſed.</p>
            <p>"Yes, good minds are ever thus apt to
forget the benefits they confer," replied
Ellena. "But you ſhall find, my father,
that a grateful heart is equally tenacious to
remember them; it is the indelible regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of every act that is diſmiſſed from the
memory of the benefactor."</p>
            <p>"Mention no more of benefits," ſaid
Schedoni, impatiently; "let ſilence on this
ſubject henceforth indicate your wiſh to
oblige me."</p>
            <p>He roſe, and joined the hoſt, who was
at the door of his cabin. Schedoni wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to diſmiſs Spalatro as ſoon as poſſible,
and he enquired for a guide to conduct
him through that part of the foreſt, which
remained to be traverſed. In this poor
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0247200302:355"/>
town, a perſon willing to undertake that
office was eaſily to be found, but the hoſt
went in queſt of a neighbour whom he had
recommended.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Spalatro returned, without
having ſucceeded in his commiſſion. Not
any lay-habit could be procured, upon ſo
ſhort a notice, that ſuited Schedoni. He
was obliged, therefore, to continue his
journey to the next town at leaſt, in his
own dreſs, but the. neceſſity was not very
ſerious to him, ſince it was improbable that
he ſhould be known in this obſcure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Preſently the hoſt appeared with his neighbour,
when Schedoni, having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſatisfactory anſwers to his queſtions,
engaged him for the remainder of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt-road,
and diſmiſſed Spalatro. The
ruffian departed with ſullen reluctance and
evident ill-will, circumſtances which the
Confeſſor ſcarcely noticed, while occupied
by the ſatisfaction of eſcaping from the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0247200302:356"/>
preſence of the atrocious partner of his
conſcience. But Ellena, as he paſſed her,
obſerved the malignant diſappointment of
his look, and it ſerved only to heighten
the thankfulneſs his departure occaſioned
her.</p>
            <p>It was afternoon before the travellers
proceeded. Schedoni had calculated that
they could eaſily reach the town, at which
they deſigned to paſs the night, before the
cloſe of evening, and he had been in no
haſte to depart during the heat of the day.
Their track now lay through a country leſs
ſavage, though ſcarcely leſs wild than that
they had paſſed in the morning. It
emerged from the interior towards the
border of the foreſt; they were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
encloſed by impending mountains;
the withdrawing ſhades were no longer
impenetrable to the eye, but now and
then opened to gleams of ſunſhine-land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
and blue diſtances; and in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
ſcene, many a green glade ſpread
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0247200302:357"/>
it's boſom to the ſun. The grandeur of
the trees, however, did not decline; the
plane, the oak, and the cheſtnut ſtill
threw a pomp of foliage round theſe ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpots, and ſeemed to conſecrate the
mountain ſtreams, that deſcended beneath
their ſolemn ſhade.</p>
            <p>To the haraſſed ſpirits of Ellena the
changing ſcenery was refreſhing, and ſhe
frequently yielded her cares to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of majeſtic nature. Over the
gloom of Schedoni, no ſcenery had, at any
moment, power; the ſhape and paint of
external imagery gave neither impreſſion
or colour to his fancy. He contemned the
ſweet illuſions, to which other ſpirits are
liable, and which often confer a delight
more exquiſite, and not leſs innocent,
than any, which deliberative reaſon can
beſtow.</p>
            <p>The ſame thoughtful ſilence, that had
wrapt him at the beginning of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
he ſtill preſerved, except when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0247200302:358"/>
he aſked a queſtion of the guide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the way, and received anſwers too
loquacious for his humour. This loqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
however, was not eaſily repreſſed, and
the peaſant had already begun to relate
ſome terrible ſtories of murder, committed
in theſe foreſts upon people, who had been
hardy enough to venture into them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a guide, before the again abſtracted
Schedoni even noticed that he ſpoke.
Though Ellena did not give much credit
to theſe narratives, they had ſome effect
upon her fears, when ſoon after ſhe entered
the deep ſhades of a part of the foreſt, that
lay along a narrow defile, whence every
glimpſe of cheerful landſcape was again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by precipices, which towered on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide. The ſtilneſs was not leſs effectual
than the gloom, for no ſounds were heard,
except ſuch as ſeemed to characterize ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and impreſs it's awful power more
deeply on the heart,—the hollow daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of torrents deſcending diſtantly, and the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0247200302:359"/>
deep ſighings of the wind, as it paſſed
among trees, which threw their broad arms
over the cliffs, and crowned the higheſt
ſummits. Onward, through the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
windings of the defile, no living object
appeared; but, as Ellena looked fearfully
back, ſhe thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
figure advancing beneath the duſky
umbrage that cloſed the view. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
her ſuſpicion to Schedoni,
though not her fears, and they ſtopped
for a moment, to obſerve further. The
object advanced ſlowly, and they perceived
the ſtature of a man, who, having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to approach, ſuddenly pauſed, and
then glided away behind the foliage that
croſſed the perſpective, but not before
Ellena fancied ſhe diſcriminated the figure
of Spalatro, None but a purpoſe the
moſt deſperate, ſhe believed, could have
urged him to follow into this paſs, inſtead
of returning, as he had pretended, to his
home. Yet it appeared improbable, that
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0247200302:360"/>
he alone ſhould be willing to attack two
armed perſons, for both Schedoni and the
guide had weapons of defence. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
afforded her only a momentary
reſpite from apprehenſion, ſince it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that he might not be alone, though
only one perſon had yet been ſeen among
the ſhrouding branches of the woods.
"Did you not think he reſembled Spala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro?"
ſaid Ellena to the Confeſſor, "was
he not of the ſame ſtature and air? You are
well armed, or I ſhould fear for you, as
well as for myſelf."</p>
            <p>"I did not obſerve a reſemblance,"
replied Schedoni, throwing a glance back,
"but whoever he is, you have nothing
to apprehend from him, for he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared."</p>
            <p>"Yes, Signor, ſo much the worſe,"
obſerved the guide, "ſo much the
worſe, if he means us any harm, for he
can ſteal along the rocks behind theſe
thickets, and ſtrike out upon us before
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0247200302:361"/>
we are aware of him. Or, if he knows
the path that runs among thoſe old oaks
yonder, on the left, where the ground
riſes, he has us ſure at the turning of
the next cliff."</p>
            <p>" Speak lower," ſaid Schedoni, " un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
you mean that he ſhould benefit by
your inſtructions."</p>
            <p>Though the Confeſſor ſaid this without
any ſuſpicion of evil intention from the
guide, the man immediately began to
juſtify himſelf, and added, " I'll give him
a hint of what he may expect, however,
if he attacks us." As he ſpoke, he fired
his trombone in the air, when every rock
reverberated the ſound, and the faint
and fainter thunder retired in murmurs
through all the windings of the defile.
The eagerneſs, with which the guide had
juſtified himſelf, produced an effect upon
Schedoni contrary to what he deſigned;
and the Confeſſor, as he watched him
ſuſpiciouſly, obſerved, that after he had
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0247200302:362"/>
fired, he did not load his piece again.
" Since you have given the enemy ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
intimation where to find us," ſaid
Schedoni, " you will do well to prepare
for his reception; load again, friend. I
have arms too, and they are ready."</p>
            <p>While the man ſullenly obeyed, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,
again alarmed, looked back in ſearch
of the ſtranger, but not any perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
beneath the gloom, and no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep
broke upon the ſtilneſs. When,
however, ſhe ſuddenly heard a ruſtling
noiſe, ſhe looked to the bordering thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
almoſt expecting to ſee Spalatro break
from among them, before ſhe perceived
that it was only the ſounding pinions of
birds, which, ſtartled by the report of
the trombone from their high neſts in
the cliffs, winged their way from danger.</p>
            <p>The ſuſpicions of the Confeſſor had,
probably, been ſlight, for they were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient;
and when Ellena next addreſſed
him, he had again retired within himſelf.
He was ruminating upon an excuſe to be
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0247200302:363"/>
offered the Marcheſa, which might be
ſufficient both to aſſuage her diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and baffle her curioſity, and he
could not, at preſent, fabricate one that
might ſoothe her reſentment, without
riſk of betraying his ſecret.</p>
            <p>Twilight had added its gloom to that
of the rocks, before the travellers diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
the town, at which they meant to
paſs the night. It terminated the defile,
and its grey houſes could ſcarcely be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
from the precipice upon which
they hung, or from the trees that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſomed
them. A rapid ſtream rolled
below, and over it a bridge conducted
the wanderers to the little inn, at which
they were to take up their abode. Here,
quietly lodged, Ellena diſmiſſed all preſent
apprehenſion of Spalatro, but ſhe ſtill
believed ſhe had ſeen him, and her ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
as to the motive of his extraordinary
journey, were not appeaſed.</p>
            <p>As this was a town of ampler accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
than the one they had left, Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0247200302:364"/>
eaſily procured a lay-habit, that
would diſguiſe him for the remainder of
the journey; and Ellena was permitted to
lay aſide the nun's veil, for one of a more
general faſhion; but, in diſmiſſing it, ſhe
did not forget that it had been the veil of
Olivia, and ſhe preſerved it as a ſacred
relique of her favourite recluſe.</p>
            <p>The diſtance between this town and
Naples was ſtill that of ſeveral days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
according to the uſual mode of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling;
but the moſt dangerous part of
the way was now overcome, the road
having emerged from the foreſts; and
when Schedoni, on the following morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was departing, he would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
the guide, had not the hoſt
aſſured him, he would find one ſtill neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in the open, but wild, country through
which he muſt paſs. Schedoni's diſtruſt
of this guide had never been very ſerious,
and, as the reſult of the preceding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proved favourable, he had reſtored
him ſo entirely to his confidence, as will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0247200302:365"/>
to engage him for the preſent day.
In this confidence, however, Ellena did not
perfectly coincide; ſhe had obſerved the
man while he loaded the trombone, on
Schedoni's order, and his evident reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
had almoſt perſuaded her, that he
was in league with ſome perſon who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to attack them; a conjecture, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
the more readily admitted while her
mind was ſuffering from the impreſſion of
having ſeen Spalatro. She now ventured
to hint her diſtruſt to the Confeſſor, who
paid little attention to it, and reminded
her, that ſufficient proof of the man's
honeſty had appeared, in their having been
permitted to paſs in ſafety, a defile ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the purpoſe of rapine as that
of yeſterday. To a reply apparently ſo
reaſonable, Ellena could oppoſe nothing,
had ſhe even dared to preſs the topic;
and ſhe re-commenced the journey with
gayer hopes.</p>
