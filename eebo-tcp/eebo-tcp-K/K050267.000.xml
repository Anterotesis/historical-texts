            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS almoſt every thing in this
criticiſing Age is liable to be
cavil'd at and diſputed, ſo
contrary to the Rules of
Charity and good Humour, it is the
avow'd Temper, or at leaſt the Practice
of the Age, where any thing ſo diſputed
is liable to a double or differing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
always to take it in the
worſt.</p>
            <p>To prevent this, and anticipate the
Cavils of thoſe who would ſuggeſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
where no Evil ought to be ſuggeſted,
a ſhort Preface is thought needful to
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1213900900:4"/>
this Work, tho otherwiſe plain enough,
to prepare the Reader to be at leaſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and juſt, if he ſhould not incline to
be candid and generous, in his looking
over the following Sheets.</p>
            <p>Here's no Apology to be made for Vice,
no extenuating of Crimes, no Harangues
for Drunkenneſs; when, at the ſame
time, the Liquors, which it has been
ſuggeſted are inſtrumental to our Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitys,
are, as the Reader may think,
ſpoken favourably of.</p>
            <p>But we are ſtating the Caſe of the
Diſtilling Buſineſs as a Commerce, and
of the Diſtillers as a Society improving
that Commerce, for the Good of their
Country; enquiring whether they are a
publick Good, and Encouragers of the
Trade yea or no: if they are, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> now ſitting will
judge whether it is meet to encourage
them or not; and if not, <hi>vice verſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:1213900900:5"/>
But it ſeems needful to hint, and this
is the Reaſon of this Preface, That the
Queſtion does not ſeem to lie here, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Spirits ſhall be diſtill'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
among us, and whether the Poor
ſhall drink them? But, Whether the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſhall ſurniſh us with them, and
cheat and impoſe upon us, as well pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
as privately, in the groſſeſt and
moſt barefac'd manner? or whether our
own Manufacture ſhall ſupply us, our
own Growth be conſum'd, and our own
People employ'd?</p>
            <p>Theſe are indeed very ſhort Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and I think few Words will decide
them: If the firſt be encourag'd, and
Fraud and clandeſtine Trade be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for want of due Regulations, and
proper Meaſures taken to prevent it,
I ſhall only ſay it ſhall not be for want
of due Information. But if our own
Manufacture, the Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
of our own People, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of our own Growth be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1213900900:6"/>
as we cannot doubt they will, I
take the Liberty to ſay, the Diſtilling-Trade
in <hi>England,</hi> which is already ſo
much improv'd and encreas'd, will in a
very few Years conquer all foreign Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations,
all the clandeſtine and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Management of other Countries,
who impoſe upon us, and even the
ſmuggling and running of <hi>French</hi> Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
itſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſame Ignorance that occaſions moſt
of the Prejudice at the Diſtilling Trade
among us, oblig'd me to enter into the
Detail of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Operations with
their Malt Spirits; and the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of <hi>Geneva</hi> among the common
People, which otherwiſe ſome might
pretend is uſeleſs in the Caſe before us.
But 'tis needful we ſhould know Things
in their Original, and be able to ſee
from what Fountain every Miſchief
flows, that we may not lay the Weight
where it ought not to lie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1213900900:7"/>
The <hi>Dutch</hi> were doubtleſs look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as great Benefactors to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and who by taking off yearly ſo
great a Quantity of our Corn, were ſo
great an Advantage to our Landed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
our Navigation, and our Poor;
and while the Product, let it be what
it will, was conſum'd abroad, and their
Geneva and other Spirits reach'd no
farther than their Camps and Fleets
(and withal while they did not cheat us
in the Draw-backs too, if ever that time
was) they were really ſo.</p>
            <p>But here you will ſee that it is poſſible,
in the general turn of things, and the
Changes which matters of Trade, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with the reſt of human Affairs, are
ſubject to, what is a publick Good to day,
may be a publick Grievance to morrow;
and what a Law is made to encourage
at one time, may require a Law to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
and prevent at another: And
this is the true Caſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilling
Trade, as it ſhocks with, and at
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1213900900:8"/>
this time interferes with our own, as
will be ſeen from <hi>p.</hi> 24 to 36. of this
Work, in which an Account of that Part
is given.</p>
            <p>Time, and a ſhort Diſcourſe, ſwell'd
alſo beyond expectation in other needful
parts, prevents entring further into
theſe things at preſent; but by this may
be ſeen the great Difficultys this valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Buſineſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſtillery
has ſtruggled with, and the great and
juſt Arguments for its farther Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.
All which is humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

            <head>A BRIEF
STATE
OF THE
CASE
OF THE
DISTILLERS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Diſtilling of Spirits, is indeed an
antient Art; and the Diſtillers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
is antient, having been incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
But as the Nature of their Buſineſs is quite
chang'd, that they work in a new Method,
and from new Materials, are under new Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and their Intereſt and Trade ſtand in a
new and quite different Situation from what
was the Caſe formerly; ſo it may be ſaid,
their very Conſtitution is modern, and they
are young in the Manufacture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1213900900:10"/>
But however young the Trade may be, and
that the Materials they work from are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from what they formerly made uſe of,
it is apparent, that they are infinitely more a
publick Benefit to the Nation, than they were
before; and that the Diſtilling Trade, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in its preſent Magnitude, is one of the
greateſt Improvements, and the moſt to the
Advantage of the Publick, of any Buſineſs
now carried on in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In former Times, the Diſtillers, like other
incorporated Arts and Myſterys, work'd whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for themſelves and for their own Profit:
now they, without a <hi>Pun,</hi> may be truly ſaid to
be <hi>publick ſpirited People;</hi> for they work for
the whole Body, and that immediately and
in a particular manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They work for the Gentlemen or Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Intereſt, in conſuming the Produce of their
Soil, and encouraging Tillage and Husbandry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They work for the Tenant and Farmer,
in helping them off with their Corn, and
particularly in finding them a Market for thoſe
Grains of the meaneſt Quality, and which it
would be difficult, if not impoſſible for them
to diſpoſe of to Advantage any other way.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They work for the Navigation of the
Kingdom; abundance of Shipping and other
Veſſels, being daily and conſtantly, and ſome
wholly employ'd, in bringing the Corn and
Coal which is conſum'd by the Diſtillers Trade,
up to <hi>London,</hi> from the remoteſt Parts of the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1213900900:11"/>
4. They work for the Poor; many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Familys being neceſſarily employ'd as
well in the Husbandry of the Corn they uſe,
as in the Malting it, then in carrying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
it to and from the Malting-Places, to
the Ports for ſhipping it to <hi>London,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to <hi>London</hi> directly by Land.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But above all this, they work for the
Publick in the extraordinary Sums of Money,
which they pay to the Crown, as well in the
Exciſe upon the Spirits they extract, as in
the Duty upon the Malt paid before it comes
to their Hands, and in the Tax upon Coals.</p>
            <p>To explain theſe Particulars a little farther,
tho as briefly as we can, let it be conſider'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The landed Gentlemen muſt be ſenſible
the Diſtillers work for them, ſince the Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Trade in and about <hi>London</hi> only, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
about 200000 Quarters of Corn, and
that Corn neceſſarily employs 100000 Acres
of Land for the Produce of it; for this kind of
Corn being generally the Product of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Countys, where the Lands are not rich,
we may venture to ſay, two Quarters upon
an Acre one with another, is no mean Crop,
and is ſufficient to make a due Calculation
upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> The Horſes employ'd in the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
of 100000 Acres of Land every Year,
and in the Carriage of this Corn to the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and the Re-carriage of the Malt either to
the Market, or to the Port where it is to be
ſhipp'd, tho no gueſs can be made at their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1213900900:12"/>
Number; yet this may with Modeſty be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that thoſe Cattle being very many,
muſt neceſſarily conſume the Growth and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
of many Thouſands of Acres of Land
more.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſufficient to ſay, that if thoſe Lands
did not produce this Corn, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſomething elſe; or that if the Diſtillers
did not take off and conſume this Corn, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
elſe would; ſeeing it is evident, <hi>England</hi>
being now become what they properly call
a Corn Country, produces much more Corn
than it can conſume: And if that Conſumption
ſhould be leſſen'd, many of thoſe Lands muſt
lie uncultivated, as it is manifeſt many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Acres did before. It is alſo a receiv'd
Maxim, that every Quarter of Corn which is
carried off, and conſum'd more than was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
before, (no Scarcity being occaſioned at
Home) is ſo much clear Gain to the publick
Stock of the Nation.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that the Liquor diſtill'd is
conſumed at Home, and ſo is not equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to the publick Stock, as what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;
'tis anſwered, (1.) But much of it is
alſo exported, and more would be, if Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
were given. (2.) That moſt of what
is conſumed at Home, is us'd in the ſtead and
room of French and Foreign Brandys and
Spirits, which are generally bought abroad with
ready Money, and ſmuggl'd on Shore to the
Ruin of the fair Trader, and leſſening the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
by a conſtant abcminable Fraud, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1213900900:13"/>
which it appears no Laws yet made, have been
ſufficient to prevent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Tenant or Farmer is particularly
work'd for, being aſſiſted by the Diſtilling
Trade, and that in ſeveral reſpects; as the
Diſtillers not only take off a great Quantity
of their Corn, but alſo take off thoſe Kinds
which are not marketable for other Uſes: As,
particularly, (1.) When thro' long Drought the
Grain appears thin and light, as is often the
Caſe; or by unſeaſonable Rains in Harveſt the
Farmers cannot get their Corn well in; or when
by that or other Diſaſters and Accidents it is
damaged, either in the <hi>Field,</hi> or in the <hi>Barn,</hi>
in the <hi>Ear,</hi> or in the <hi>Sack;</hi> in all which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Farmer is put to great Difficulty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of it, and were it not for the Diſtilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Trade
could do little with it but feed his Hogs,
which would not enable him to pay his Rent.
(2.) The Farmers have oftentimes Lands which
not only will not bear any other Corn, but
that for want of Manure and Improvement.
(which in ſome Places is hard to be had) of
thro' the Sterility and Poverty of the Soil, are
unable to produce either better Corn, or a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and fuller Grain of the Kind; and which
Lands, if they could not employ them thus,
muſt lie waſte and untill'd, but are profitably
cultivated by the Vent which they find for that
meaner Kind of Grain to the Diſtillers. This
is viſible in the Northern and Eaſtern Countys
and Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> where a very great
Quantity of poor and unimproveable Lands,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1213900900:14"/>
which formerly lay waſte, are now plow'd and
ſow'd, to the Advantage of the poor Tenants,
tho much more of the Landlord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Encouragement given to Navigation
by the Diſtilling-Trade in <hi>England,</hi> is viſible
in many Branches of it: For the Corn and the
Coals which they conſume, being a bulky and
heavy Carriage, and not to be eaſily brought
far by Land, the Number of Coaſting Ships and
Veſſels of all Kinds are viſibly encreas'd ſince
the Encreaſe of this Trade, and conſequently
the Number of Seamen employ'd are encreas'd;
the Advantage of which is ſo well known, it
needs not be enlarg'd on: The Coaſting-Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
alſo being the greateſt and beſt Nurſery
of able Seamen in the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>To the Encreaſe of the Number of Ships
and Veſſels thus employ'd, might be added
here, the Addition which that Encreaſe is to
all the numerous Trades, both Foreign and
Home-Trades, and to the Employment of
Hands, and Encreaſe of Buſineſs, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
attends the building, fitting out, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
and victualling all thoſe Veſſels. But
I forbear to run it out to its full Length, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
my ſelf to repreſent that this Trade is
a great Addition to the Marine Intereſt, and
an Encreaſe and Encouragement of all its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencys.</p>
            <p>That
they work for the Poor is evident by
their ſetting the Poor to work, which indeed
is the beſt way of working for them. The
Number of Hands employ'd, or whoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
are bettered and encreaſed by this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1213900900:15"/>
Trade, would take up a Volume by it ſelf to
calculate and caſt it up. It is ſufficient to ſay,
that as all Encreaſe of Buſineſs is an Encreaſe
of Employment for the Poor, ſo all Encreaſe
of Employment for the Poor is an Encreaſe of
the publick Stock; as it enables thoſe People
to gain their Bread, who were not able to do
it, or not ſo well able, before. And this again
aſſiſts the landed Intereſt too, in abating the
heavy Rates of the Pariſh-Poor, and enabling
ſeveral thouſands of poor People to ſupport
themſelves and Familys, which muſt otherwiſe
be left upon the Pariſhes to maintain.</p>
            <p>This runs thro' all the ſeveral Branches of
Buſineſs and People, thro' whoſe Hands the ſaid
Manufactures paſs, as well the Diſtilling Part it
ſelf, as the Materials made uſe of for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
as Corn and Coals, and the Shipping
and other Carriages already mentioned; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the vaſt expenſive Works of the Diſtillers
themſelves, the Copper and Iron-Work they
make uſe of, the Veſſels and large Utenſils,
and the Number of Hands employ'd, and the
exceeding Charge daily expended by them in
all theſe Things.</p>
            <p>But we wave the multiplying Particulars, and
come to the laſt Article, namely, the great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to the Publick, ariſing by the Dutys with
which this Trade is loaded, and which have
now for many Years encreaſed the Funds upon
which the Publick Credit has been ſo long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upheld;
and theſe are conſiderable in three
Branches.<list>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1213900900:16"/>
                  <item>1. The ſeveral Exciſes upon the Spirits
themſelves, laid in ſeveral Branches and at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Times, and which amount in the whole to
above a hundred thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Duty upon Malt, which is paid by
the Diſtillers in the Price of the Goods, when
they buy, and which amounts to a very great
Sum.</item>
                  <item>3. The Duty upon Coals, of which the
Diſtillers conſume, by Calculation, above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand Chaldrons a Year.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Advantages of this Trade being thus
conſider'd, it occurs in the next Place, to ſhew,
(1.) That this Trade is yet improving, that
it is a growing Trade, and that if not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by unreaſonable Hardſhips and Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it is likely to encreaſe in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner. And, (2.) That this Encreaſe
is likely to be obtain'd, not by an Encreaſe of
Exceſſes and Immoralities, but by changing the
Guſt of the People, from drinking thoſe other
Spirits and Brandys, which being manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
corrupted, and adulterated abroad, are
not only imported, as well clandeſtinely as
otherwiſe, to the great Injury of the Health of
our People, but being bought by our ready
Money, are a great Diſadvantage to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and Injury to the Revenue.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Diſtilling Trade is a ſtill improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and growing Buſineſs; and it is worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
to what a Height, and on what a juſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1213900900:17"/>
Foundation it is likely to improve; for if it be
already, even while it is not much above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years old, in its preſent Magnitude, ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
as has been already ſaid, as to pay ſo
great a Revenue to the Crown, and employ
ſuch a prodigious Number of Acres of Land,
beſides Ships, Cattle and Men, what may it
not do, when by the Improvement of the Art,
and the granting ſuch Regulations by which
it would flouriſh, it ſhall from the mere Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Goods that ſhall be produc'd, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſuppreſs the Importation of Foreign Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and even of French Brandy itſelf; the
Spirit diſtill'd from Corn in <hi>England,</hi> prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over them all by the Force of its own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</p>
            <p>Nor
is this Queſtion unworthy the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Crown it ſelf; whether the
Encouraging the Diſtilling Trade, is not really
a better and more effectual way to raiſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
by it, than loading it with new Taxes,
which can have no other Effect than to leſſen
the Conſumption, and bring a riſing Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
under a Decay.</p>
            <p>It is evident, that as well by the Dearneſs of
French Brandy, and the Corruption and Fraud of
the Dutch Importation, as by the improv'd and
ſtill advancing Goodneſs of the Engliſh Malt
Spirit, which I ſhall make appear is coming
fairly up to be equal to the beſt French Brandy;
the great and opiniated Guſt of the People to
French and Foreign Brandy, is already much
abated, and the Conſumption of our own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1213900900:18"/>
gains Ground on them every Day, to
the great Advantage of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>As the Conſumption encreaſes, the publick
Revenue encreaſes of courſe, without the
Addition of new Taxes, with this undeniable
Difference to the Advantage of <hi>England,</hi>
namely, That this way as the Revenue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes,
all the fore-mentioned Advantages
will encreaſe: The Quantity of Lands to be
cultivated, will encreaſe: The Advantage to
the Farmer, the Employment of Cattle, Ships
and Men, will all encreaſe with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
by burdening the Trade with new Dutys,
it cannot be pretended the Conſumption will
encreſe, tho the Duty ſhould; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if it ſhould decreaſe, as is moſt natural,
the Dearneſs of all Goods leſſening the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
then all thoſe national Advantages
above muſt decreaſe in proportion.</p>
            <p>As to the weak Pretences of the Malt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
being deſtructive to the Health of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they ſeem only fit to be jeſted with, as they
have been: and I muſt ſay, I am ſorry to ſee
ſome Magiſterial People have expos'd their
Weakneſs in this Point ſo much.</p>
            <p>They have no where ſhew'd the World a
Reaſon why as good and wholeſom a Spirit may
not be drawn from the Corn, (whoſe mere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
in other Preparations is allow'd to be
ſo good) as from any other Materials; and if, as
the Learned ſay, the Spirit only is the nutritive
Part of all our Food, whether Meat or Drink,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1213900900:19"/>
there can then be no queſtion, but that a Spirit
carefully extracted from the groſs and humid
Parts, and faithfully prepared without any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterations
or corrupt Mixtures, muſt be as
wholeſom to the Body, as the ſame Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extracted
and mix'd with the common Liquids
by Infuſion and Ebullition; or as any Spirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from other Principles of any kind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>As
for the Exceſſes and Intemperances of
the People, and their drinking immoderate
Quantitys of Malt Spirits, the Diſtillers are
not concern'd in it at all; their Buſineſs is to
prepare a Spirit wholeſom and good. If the
People will deſtroy themſelves by their own
Exceſſes, and make that Poiſon, which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
an Antidote; 'tis the Magiſtrate's Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to help that, not the Diſtillers. 'Tis
humbly conceiv'd alſo, they would do the
ſame with Foreign Brandy and Spirits, if there
was no diſtilling at Home in the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It
is in the next place, humbly offered to
the Publick to conſider, what a Trade, and
how ruinous to the Nation in ſeveral conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Articles, the Diſtilling Trade in <hi>England</hi>
is now oppoſed to; and how neceſſary it is to
have that pernicious Commerce, if poſſible,
ſuppreſs'd. And this Part is the more uſeful,
becauſe it ſeems very few, even of our moſt
penetrating Gentlemen, are fully Maſters of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1213900900:20"/>
Were the Foreign Importation of Spirits
confin'd only to that Species we call French,
which it is generally allow'd is a wholeſom
and well extracted Spirit; yet as the French
Brandys are a Product infinitely injurious to
our Commerce, bought from a Nation with
whom we having no Treaty of Commerce,
cannot exchange our Manufactures, but muſt
pay for them in Specie, to the evident turning the
Ballance of Trade againſt us: In this reſpect
they are injurious to the Health of the Publick,
if not to the Health of particular Bodys; and
conſequently 'tis a publick Good to diſcourage
them, and abate their Conſumption.</p>
            <p>But when we come to ſpeak of the Foreign
Spirits, (however falſly call'd Brandys) it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
there the Caſe differs extremely, and we
are ſo great Sufferers in that Part, as well in
reſpect to the Health of the Body as the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
of Commerce, and the Frauds put upon
the Crown to the great Loſs of the Revenue;
that as it is a publick Good in our Diſtilling
Trade, that we gain upon and leſſen that
Trade, ſo it muſt be ſome Service to expoſe
the Abuſes of it, and let our People ſee how
gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſly they are impos'd upon in it, both in
the publick and private Intereſt of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</p>
            <p>To
ſet this dark Commerce in a clear Light,
'tis needful to take notice, by what unhappy
Artifice the ſubtle Dutch Traders are enabled,
our own Weakneſs concurring, not only to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwork
us, but to impoſe upon us, and ſell
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1213900900:21"/>
us Spirits diſtill'd from our own Materials,
cheaper than we can make them at Home;
tho as it happens, their Avarice, ſo natural to
their Climate, will not ſuffer them to make
them ſo good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, we are to ſuppoſe they have the
Malt from <hi>England,</hi> as generally they have
from <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Parts adjacent.</p>
            <p>The Fraud begins at the very Beginning; for
the <hi>Dutch</hi> approving to have their Malt far
grown on the Floor, and without dreſſing and
skreening off the Tails, as we call them; the
Malſter lets it run in ſuch manner, that 20
Quarter of Barley ſhall meaſure out 40 Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Malt: I ſpeak within Compaſs, for it
has been known to meaſure 50 to 60 Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
from 20. Now the Fraud of this lies
here, The Malt in the Maker's Hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gaged in the Barley, the Duty, which is
4<hi>s. per</hi> Quarter, is paid by the Meaſure or
Gage of the Barley wetted; ſo the Score, or
20 Quarter pays 4<hi>l.</hi> to the King.</p>
            <p>When this Barley is malted, and the Malt
comes to be exported, the Duty of 4<hi>s. per</hi>
Quarter is drawn back by Debenture; and then
the Malt being meaſured anew, the 20 Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being encreaſed to 40, draws back upon
that Meaſure, and ſo the Exporter receives 8<hi>l.</hi>
Draw-back, upon that which paid but 4<hi>l.</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This is ſo vile a Fraud, and ſo openly
practis'd, that nothing is more wonderful to
me, than that no notice has yet been taken of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1213900900:22"/>
it, except this, that being ſo well known no
care has been taken to put a ſtop to it.</p>
            <p>But it does not end here: As there is a
Draw-back allowed for the Malt-Duty, upon
all the exported Malt, ſo there is a Bounty
paid to the Exporter, by the Crown, for the
encouraging the Exportation; and this is 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.
per</hi> Quarter more, which being likewiſe paid
upon the 40 Quarter made out of 20, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Fraud 5<hi>l.</hi> more. So that the Crown
pays back to the Exporter 13<hi>l.</hi> for every Score
of Barley malted, and receives but 4<hi>l.</hi> by
which it is no wonder that the Malt-Tax ſhould
be deficient.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then the <hi>Dutch</hi> pay a ſham Price <hi>per</hi>
Quarter for their Malt, and thus receive double
for it again, it is no wonder that they can diſtil
a Spirit from it cheaper than the Diſtillers in
<hi>England,</hi> who fairly pay 6<hi>s. per</hi> Buſhel to
the Crown for all their Malt, and full 6<hi>d.</hi> a
Gallon for the Spirits they draw from it.</p>
            <p>Nor have the <hi>Dutch</hi> done with us yet; but
let us examine it thorowly, and we ſhall ſee a
greater Fraud yet behind.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> I know not by what Error on
our Side, are allow'd to import here foreign
Brandy, the Duty upon Importation being 4<hi>s.</hi>
2<hi>d. per</hi> Gallon, or thereabouts; whereas the
<hi>French</hi> Brandy pays 6<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d. per</hi> Gallon. This
our People take up with, and call it <hi>French</hi>
Brandy; and having ſufficient Proof that it
comes from abroad, are ſatisfied with it as
ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1213900900:23"/>
The <hi>Dutch</hi> tell us, it is not <hi>French,</hi> tho we
have good Reaſon to believe that all the real
Brandy that is in it is <hi>French,</hi> by which we
are cheated that way. But that is not the
Caſe; 'tis apparent, the <hi>Dutch</hi> mix their own
Malt Spirits with this Brandy, and ſend it to
us, while our People, deluded with the Notion
that it muſt be right Brandy, becauſe it comes
by a foreign Permit, eagerly buy it for right
Brandy, and give a Price accordingly.</p>
            <p>Let any one judge then under what Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
we carry on this Trade with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and how much it is the Intereſt of
<hi>England</hi> to put a Stop to it; and granting it is
our Intereſt, the next thing is to conſider what
is the Way to do it: And that is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd;
the only Way is, to diſcourage the
Importation of their adulterated Brandys, and
encourage and encreaſe the Diſtilling Trade at
home, by which ſo many Advantages accrue
to the Nation, and the Conſequences of which
would yet be greater than perhaps is expected,
or than is thought poſſible, except by ſome Men
of more Penetration than ordinary, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The People will by little and little be
brought off from being ſo fond of foreign Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
by the Difficulty of coming at them, and
the Badneſs of their Quality; as we ſee the
Taſte of the Nation was effectually brought
off from the <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Wines, by
the Prohibitions and high Dutys of the late
War.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1213900900:24"/>
2. The Diſtillers here are apparently able
to make as good, as fine, as clean and as whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
a Spirit, from our own Materials, as any
of thoſe imported from abroad; infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the <hi>Dutch:</hi> and as they are every
Day improving, will very ſoon, if they are
not diſcourag'd, be able to outdo even the
<hi>French</hi> Brandy itſelf. And it is apparent they
produce ſo fine a Spirit already, that a very
nice Palate cannot diſtinguiſh it from <hi>French;</hi>
and had they the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trick of importing it
from abroad, they might eaſily ſell it for
<hi>French</hi> Brandy, among the People.</p>
            <p>I foreſee, that as abundance of People are
apt ignorantly to charge the Immoralitys, and
particularly the Drunkenneſs of the Age, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the great Encouragement of the diſtilling
Malt Spirits; ſo they would make that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Evil, a Reaſon againſt the juſt Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
which ought to be given to the
Buſineſs of the Diſtillers as a Trade; as if
the encouraging the Diſtillers Buſineſs, would
be an encouraging of Drunkenneſs: whereas
we are ſpeaking of it, as a needful and an
advantageous Commerce; a Benefit to the
Publick, to the Poor, and to the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And that would be infinitely more ſo,
if it may be encourag'd, in keeping out and
putting a ſtop to that Foreign pernicious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
carried on to our great Loſs and Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
As to the Vice of Drinking to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
we are no way concern'd in it; the
Brewing Trade, and the Wine Trade, are liable
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1213900900:25"/>
to the ſame Objections: Yet I do not find it
argued by any body, that therefore we muſt
have no Beer, nor Wine.</p>
            <q>
               <l>So haſty Showers, when they from Heaven flow down,</l>
               <l>Are ſent to fructify, and not to drown;</l>
               <l>And in the Torrent if a Drunkard ſink,</l>
               <l>'Tis not the Brook that drowns him but the Drink.</l>
               <l>But twou'd be hard, becauſe the Sinner's ſlain,</l>
               <l>For fear of Drowning, we muſt have no Rain.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But to clear up this Caſe, upon which ſo
much weak Cavilling has been made, I beg
leave in a kind of Hiſtorical way, to enter a
little into the State of National Drinking in
<hi>England,</hi> as it has been, and as it now is. And
tho I ſhall be very brief, I ſlatter myſelf it
ſhall be both uſeful and diverting; eſpecially,
I anſwer for it, that it ſhall come directly to
the Caſe in hand; and clear not only the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillers
and the Diſtilling Trade, but even all
the Liquors they make, from the Charge of
being deſtructive to the Morals of the People,
or an Encouragement to Drunkenneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
any otherwiſe than, nay not ſo much as,
all ſtrong Liquors are ſo to thoſe, who drink to
Exceſs.</p>
            <p>Our Drunkenneſs as a National Vice, takes
its Epocha at the Reſtoration <hi>Anno</hi> 1661-62, or
within a very few Years after. Some run it back
to <hi>James</hi> I. Time, and refer us to the Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
on the Ceiling of the Banqueting-Houſe,
for Proof of it; but I am not writing Satyres;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1213900900:26"/>
I am upon a Search after not ſo much the Vice,
as the Materials and Manufactures upon which
it is fed, and by which it was ſupported.</p>
            <p>Joy, Mirth, good Cheer, and good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
were the Solace of the common People
in the Year 1661. They rejoiced that after
a long Uſurpation, the King ſhould enjoy his
own again; that after a long Series of Blood
and Confuſion, and a Civil War in the Bowels
of their Country, the People ſhould enjoy a
publick Peace and Tranquillity; that Trade
ſhould flouriſh, and Plenty ſucceed Miſery and
Want. Theſe were the ſeveral Reaſons of their
Joy; and very merry, and very mad, and very
drunken, the People were, and grew more and
more ſo every Day.</p>
            <p>As to the Materials, Beer and Ale were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Articles; they went a great way in
the Work at firſt, but were far from being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
Strong Waters, which had not been
long in Uſe, came in play; the Occaſion was
this: In the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars, it had been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That the Captains of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Men
of War, when they were to engage with our
Ships, uſually ſet a Hogſhead of Brandy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broach,
afore the Maſt; and bid the Men <hi>drink
luſtick,</hi> then they might <hi>fight luſtick:</hi> and our
poor Seamen felt the Force of the Brandy,
ſometimes to their coſt.</p>
            <p>We were not long behind them; but ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the War, we began to abound in ſtrong
Water-Shops. Theſe were a ſort of petty Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillers,
who made up thoſe compound Waters
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1213900900:27"/>
from ſuch mixt and confus'd Traſh, as they
could get to work from, ſuch as damag'd and
eager, or ſour Wines; Wines that had taken
Salt Water in at Sea; Lees and Bottoms; alſo
damag'd Sugars, and Melaſſes, Grounds of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and innumerable other ſuch like. For till
then there was very little Diſtilling known
in <hi>England,</hi> but for phyſical Uſes. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
they drew were foul, and groſs; but they
mixt them up with ſuch Additions as they
could get, to make them palatable, and ſo
gave them in general, the Name of <hi>Cordial Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
And thus the ſtrong-Water-Shops uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
made a vaſt Show of Glaſſes, labell'd
and written on, like the <hi>Gallypot Latin of
the Apothecarys,</hi> with innumerable hard
Names to ſet them off.</p>
            <p>Here, as at a Fountain, the good Wives fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
their little Fire-ſide Cupboards, with a
needful Bottle for a cheriſhing Cup: And
hence, as from wholeſale Dealers, all the little
Chandlers Shops, not in <hi>London,</hi> and its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Parts only, but over great Part of
<hi>England,</hi> were furniſh'd for Sale; and to the
perſonal Knowledge of the Writer hereof, and
of Thouſands ſtill living, not the Chandlers
Shops only, but juſt as is now complain'd of,
the Barbers Shops (<hi>Barber Chirurgeons</hi> they
were then called) were furniſhed with the ſame,
and ſold it by Retail, to the poor People who
came under their Operations.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould it be ſo ſupriſing a Thing
then in our Opinion, that the <hi>Geneva</hi> which,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1213900900:28"/>
as I ſhall ſhow preſently, is but the ſame Thing
returned again, ſhould be ſo generally received
among the inferior Poor? ſeeing would we but
look thus a little way behind us, it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that it was ſo with our Anceſtors; and
our poor People are only ſet down where their
Fore-fathers were before them, (as to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
I mean.) As to the Difference of the
Quantitys, and whether they drank more to
Exceſs, than our People do now, that is a
Queſtion by itſelf, and not much to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Caſe.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, They did not drink ſuch
deſtructive Liquors then, as we do now: That
is, in ſhort, they did not drink <hi>Geneva;</hi> for
that is the Meaning of it.</p>
            <p>This Objection muſt be ſpoken to as we go
along; becauſe it comes into the Hiſtory I am
upon; for it leads me to give a brief Account
of what they did drink, and where they had
it. I have mentioned the Introduction of the
ſtrong-Water-Shops, and petty Diſtillers, who
began this Trade. I come now to the Liquors;

            <p>But to ſum up the whole, <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeed
Water, were the Captains or Leaders;
and the ſtrong Inclinations of the People run all
into thoſe two: And in a little while the latter
prevail'd over the former too; and as Anniſeed
Water was the only Liquor for ſome Years, the
Quantity that was drunk of it, was prodigious
great: In a word, it was the <hi>Geneva</hi> of theſe
Times, it was not only ſold in the Chandlers
Shops, and in the Barbers Shops, as above;
and perhaps in Bulks and Stalls too; but it
had this particular Article attending it, (which
we are not yet arrived to with the <hi>Geneva</hi>)
<hi>viz.</hi> That it was cried about Sreets, of which,
the Memory of the famous <hi>Anniſeed Robin,</hi>
will be a never-dying Teſtimony; who was ſo
well known in <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> and the <hi>Stocks-Market</hi>
for his Liquor, and his broad-brim'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hat,
that it became proverbial, when we ſaw
a Man's Hat hanging about his Ears, to ſay,
<hi>he looks like Anniſeed Robin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Part, <hi>viz.</hi> of going about the Streets,
and into the Fields, to Shows, and Muſters of
the Trained Bands, to cry a <hi>Dram of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
has not been ſo long omitted, but that we
can all remember it: And the Bumboats, who
continue to this Day, crying a <hi>Dream of the
Bottle,</hi> in the River, among the Ships, are a
Remainder of that Cuſtom, and which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
left off at-all.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not however have troubled you
with theſe Inſtances from <hi>Low Life,</hi> but that
it is in the Scene we are now acting; and this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1213900900:30"/>
               <hi>Anniſeed Robin</hi> was a magnipotent Fellow in
his Day, I aſſure you.</p>
            <p>Having thus brought you back to the Dram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinking
Age, I muſt let you ſee how a full
Stop was put to it on a ſudden, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of the drinking World in the mean time.</p>
            <p>As all theſe various ſorts of good Liquor
had their Meridian, ſo they had too their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
and after ſome time they fell into a
general Diſlike: For the French out-did them
exceedingly, and pouring in their Liquors at
a very cheap rate, and the Goodneſs of the
Brandy recommending it ſelf alſo, the famous
<hi>Anniſeed Water</hi> began to loſe Ground, and
the People took their Drams in plain Brandy;
the Phyſicians alſo, on all Occaſions, telling
the People, it was better than any of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
Waters.</p>
            <p>Thus the beſt Brandy being ſold for 2<hi>d. per</hi>
Quartern, the Poor could have a large Dram
for a Half-penny; and the Fellows that cry'd
it about the Streets, carry'd with them little
double Dram-Cups, which being held up on one
ſide was a Penny, and on the other ſide a
Half-penny.</p>
            <p>This held on for ſeveral Years, and the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe
Books will ſhew the prodigious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
till the late Revolution; when a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and continu'd War the <hi>France</hi> breaking
out, a Prohibition of Trade follow'd, Brandy
roſe from 2<hi>d.</hi> to 6<hi>d. per</hi> Quartern, and from
thence to a Scarcity, ſo that none good was
be had. The Diſtillers not being yet come into
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1213900900:31"/>
the way of Diſtilling from Malt, could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them; and thus the Poor were thrown off
from the Dram-Cup to the Alehouſe-Pot, to
their great Regret, as well as Expence: For
now they could call for nothing leſs than a
Pint, which tho for a while it was but a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
yet ſoon after, by doubling the Exciſe,
came up to three Half-pence, where it ſtill
ſtays. And thus I have gone thro' the firſt
Part of my Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>It remains a Queſtion, which I believe is
not yet determin'd, tho I ſee not much Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in it, Whether the Morals of the People
were the better or the worſe by this Change?
If I may uſe ſo much Freedom, I inſiſt that they
are much the worſe: And as my Reaſons for
it are of ſome weight in the preſent Debate, I
beg you will hear them ſumm'd up as briefly for
your Convenience as I can.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Charge was immediately increas'd,
and a poor Man that could before be refreſh'd
in his Labour, at the ſmall Expence of a Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny,
was now oblig'd to ſpend three Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
at a time, as often as either Neceſſity or
Inclination call'd him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Expence of Time was immediately al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
encreas'd; for then poor Men in their Stails,
or Garrets, or Shops, or wherever they were
at their work, could call in, and call up, poor
<hi>Anniſeed Robin,</hi> or any of his Contemporarys
or Succeſſors, and take a Dram, without the
leaſt Loſs of their Time, and go on with their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1213900900:32"/>
Work: Or if they were at Day-Labour in the
Field or the Street, in the Wet and the Cold,
they could call for a Dram for a Penny or a
Half-Penny, as their Pockets could afford, and
go on with their Buſineſs; whereas upon this
Change the Poor were really diſtreſs'd, and
they made loud Complaints of it, as I very well
remember.</p>
            <p>Having thus gone thro' the Hiſtory of what's
paſt, and given you ſome Account of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of our Drinking till within theſe few Years,
allow me to bring it on to our own Times, and
view our Poor in the preſent Situation of their
great Affair, I mean of Liquor; for what they
ſhall drink is (I aſſure you) no matter of mean
Concern to them.</p>
            <p>The Poor, as above, having been reduc'd to
the miſerable Neceſſity of this Alehouſe-Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling,
and grown ſick of the tedious and dull,
as well as expenſive way of Drinking, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
ripe for a Change, if they could have
found any way to their Advantage; when on
a ſudden the diligent <hi>Dutch,</hi> fruitful <hi>at Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are at <hi>Imitation,</hi> (and
with their own Advantage at the bottom you
may be ſure,) help'd them out again, <hi>as they
had done once before:</hi> for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Sutlers
carry'd into the Camps in <hi>Flanders,</hi> during
the late long Wars againſt <hi>France,</hi> a certain
new diſtill'd Water call'd <hi>Geneva,</hi> being a good
wholeſom Malt Spirit, if rightly prepar'd,
wrought up with Juniper-Berries; a Thing not
only wholeſom, but really phyſical, and for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1213900900:33"/>
many Years allow'd to be ſo by the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>It was ſtrange to obſerve, how this Liquor
prevail'd in the Army; how the Soldiers were
ſurprized at the Goodneſs of it; the Spirit,
the Vigor it put into them: They declar'd
publickly to one another, there never was
any ſuch Liquor heard of in the World; it put
a perfectly new Spirit, and new Life into
them; and invigorated them at ſuch a rate,
that it made them quite a new kind of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>At
firſt, like the Champaign and Burgundy,
it was drank among the Gentlemen only; a
Drink for Generals, and for Officers: Nay,
they tell us in <hi>Holland,</hi> that even the great
D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>M<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> gave it a Character as a Thing
that inſpir'd Nature with a new Flame; and
put a ſort of Vigor into the Mind, which Nature
itſelf was a Stranger to before; and that he
recommended the (moderate) Uſe of it, to
the greateſt Men, when they were going at
any time to engage the Enemy.</p>
            <p>It is a great Miſtake to argue from hence,
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> always made their Soldiers mad
with Drink, before they led them out to
fight; for what I am ſaying of them now, is
of the Generals and Officers, before the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
came to have any fellow-feeling of this
Article.</p>
            <p>At firſt, no doubt the <hi>Dutch</hi> made a fine
Spirit of it, and as perfect as it was poſſible to
be expected: But as the <hi>Dutch</hi> are hardly to
be charged with any Deficiency in needful
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1213900900:34"/>
Craft, and that they ſaw plainly what was good
for the High, was alſo good for the Low; and
that the poor Soldiers Money was as good to
them as the great Generals, if they could but
make it out in Quantity; they ſoon came into
the old Trading Maxim, <hi>viz.</hi> that Cheapneſs
cauſes Conſumption, and found out a Way to
make a Sort of the ſame Spirit, and drawn
perhaps from the ſame Ingredients; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made meaner in Quality, ſhould be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the Purſe, as well as to the Palate
of the common Soldiers.</p>
            <p>And thus the Soldiers in the Confederate
Camp, came to the honour of Drinking upon
a Level with their Officers, or at leaſt, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
themſelves that they did ſo, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was almoſt the ſame Thing; and if there
was any apparent Difference, it was ſuch that
neither Officers or Soldiers were nice enough
in their Palates to judge of.</p>
            <p>It would interrupt our Buſineſs and the main
Deſign of this Work, to dwell too long upon
the particular Steps and Gradations, by which
<hi>Geneva</hi> gain'd ſo much upon the Minds of the
common People; or to enquire into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of it: If what I have ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> its being
thus approved by their general Officers, gave
the firſt Occaſion, it is ſufficient to tell you,
that by this means the <hi>Geneva</hi> gain'd a vaſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
among the <hi>Dutch</hi> Troops; from the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> it ſpread univerſally among all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Armys; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
as great Admirers of it, as any other
Nation whatſoever; except the mere <hi>Dutch</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1213900900:35"/>
themſelves, for they indeed drank it like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers-Milk.</p>
            <p>But
you are to take notice here, that the ſubtle
Diſtillers, and particularly the wiſe Merchants
of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who had felt the Sweet of the
Trade, had conſulted together to bring this Part
to ſute with their Intereſt alſo; namely, That
the <hi>Geneva</hi> which they ſent to the Army for the
Uſe of the Officers and Gentlemen, (eſpecially
General Officers) bore a different Price from
that which was open'd for the ordinary uſe of
the Army, and for the common Soldiers: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it differ'd in Virtue and Value or not, I
cannot enter into here; for in ſuch Liquors as
theſe, I ſhall not anſwer for it, that what is ſold
for the higheſt Price, is always of beſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in proportion: ſometimes, Fancy ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon an advanc'd Demand, anſwers to
Goodneſs, and makes an Equivalent to the
Quality of the Liquor; nor could thoſe litle
needful Frauds be always carried on without it:
but of that by itſelf.</p>
            <p>Let this Part be one way or other, and be
the Liquor better or worſe, this is certain, the
Price was reduc'd in the common Suttlers-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages;
and the poor Soldiers had their <hi>Gin</hi> at
a Rate fit for a poor Soldier to pay: And this
too betray'd a Secret in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commerce,
which it has been proper to mention already;
and for the ſake of which, this Part has been
mention'd here; and is abſolutely neceſſary to
ſpeak of, namely, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1213900900:36"/>
to bring down the Price of their <hi>Geneva,</hi>
even without reducing the Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>I muſt be allow'd to ſay, that it ſeems ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
hard, that as our Diſtillers were not
then come into the Thing, and that <hi>Geneva</hi> was
not known here; they ſhould find themſelves
ſo oppreſſed, at their firſt Entrance; and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould be able not only to make their
own Spirits <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi> cheapter than we
could, but that they ſhall be ſtill able to import
them upon us fifty <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper than we
can make them, and yet raiſe them from the
ſame Materials, namely, from our own Corn.</p>
            <p>And here there is ſuch an allow'd Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
made by the whole Legiſlature of <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> to one of the Articles ſumm'd up in
the firſt Part of this Work, namely, of the
vaſt Advantage the conſuming of Corn is to the
Landed Intereſt, that I could not but remind the
Reader of it; namely, The allowing back all
the Duty upon Malt, and 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> Bounty-Money
upon the exporting it as Barley, which
if the Sums drawn back by Certificate, in the
Countries of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> only, are caſt
up, will appear ſurpriſing in Value: I ſay, it
is a full Conceſſion to our Argument, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a full Conviction that the exporting
it, is infinitely advantageous to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi>
can be a juſtifiable Reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>Were the Commons of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to have
been told when that Law was made, that all
or the greateſt Part of the Bounty, whatever
Sums were drawn from the Publick by it, would
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1213900900:37"/>
only have two Effects, and both of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
to the Britiſh Commerce in general, and
to the Revenue in particular; it is my Opinion
they would have conſider'd better of it, before
they had paſs'd it into a Law, or have put it in
the Power of a voracious Set of Men, to have
ruin'd ſo great and riſing a Manufacture, and
Branch of our Commerce, at our own Expence.</p>
            <p>Were thoſe Bountys taken off for a while,
or were they reduc'd a little to a tolerable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
the Conſequence would preſently be this,
That the <hi>Dutch</hi> could no more draw a Spirit
50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper from our own Materials,
than we could, or import it upon us, mixt
among <hi>French</hi> or other Foreign Brandys, ſo
much to our Diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>What Reaſon can be alledged, why the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould be able to extract a better Spirit
from the fame Goods? Nay, it is evident,
they do not, and we are aſſur'd they cannot;
but they have gotten into a Courſe of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled
K<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>ry, and by this they can ſend it
over cheaper, and that is ſufficient to all the
reſt; for Cheapneſs cauſes Conſumption.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Article above: When
firſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> came into this Trade, as I
hinted before <hi>p.</hi> 25. they took their Malt ſo
rough, ſo grown, and ſo undreſs'd, that it was
frequent for a Score of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Barley at that
time, to hold out 50 to 60 quarters of Malt,
at the Exportation; which accordingly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Fraud, and entitled the Exporter to
receive back twelve Pound for a Score of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1213900900:38"/>
which upon being gaug'd in the Ciſtern,
paid to the Crown but 4<hi>l.</hi> Duty; and ſo again
in the Bounty: But they have been pleas'd to
be a little leſs barefac'd ſince, and have (thanks
to their Modeſty) reduc'd it by a ſlight Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
as above, to forty Quarters for twenty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> There is a little Cavil which may
be rais'd here; and we doubt not our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
will think, they have ſome Advantage in
it, namely, That the Barley does generally
ſwell one in the Score, before the gauging:
but we may anſwer that by itſelf.</p>
            <p>To what Extremes do we ſee wiſe Men run,
upon wrong Information of Things; and yet
how little Care do they take to be rightly and
better inform'd of the Things they are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
about? It will perhaps be very hard to
perſuade Men of common Senſe to believe,
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> can import their Spirits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from our Materials, 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than we can make them; and yet, at the
ſame time prove too, that all the ordinary Parts
of the Workmanſhip about them, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as cheap in <hi>London,</hi> as in <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it muſt be confeſſed, that when they
come to be more fully and rightly inform'd of
things, and to ſee what a Cheat is put upon the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, in the Conditions upon which
they get their Corn, which are the Materials;
the Riddle is expounded preſently, and we
cannot ſuppoſe Men to have common Senſe,
who will not then open their Eyes to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1213900900:39"/>
But to come back to theCamp: Our sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
taſting this Liquor, brought the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
as well as the Fame of it, over with
them <hi>at the enſuing Peace;</hi> and our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillers
preparing it as well here, as the <hi>Dutch</hi>
abroad, they ſupply'd the People with it,
wrought from our own Corn the Product of
our own Land, very much to our Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
as has been ſaid already: the Encreaſe
of the Demand, afterwards encreasſing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of our own Malt, to a very great
degree.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, <hi>Bacchus</hi> and the <hi>Brewer</hi> take Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
at this Invaſion: and tho what between
the <hi>Wine-Brewer,</hi> and the <hi>Beer-Brewer,</hi> they
have had the poiſoning Trade to themſelves to
long, that one would think they ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
with the Miſchiefs of it, tho they were
not with the Profits, yet it ſeems they do not
ſit eaſy under it; tho I am told the Pretence
of the Brewing Trade being declined on this
Account, is but a Pretence, and no more. It
ſeems they could have been content with it in
the Apothecarys Shops, and allow'd it among
the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> to paſs for good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick:
but when they found it applied to the
defeat of <hi>Tippling</hi> and <hi>Sotting,</hi> as above, they
reſolv'd againſt it, as fatal and deſtructive to the
Health, and Underſtanding; and that as to the
Tempers of the People, it was ſafer to be drunk
with any thing, rather than <hi>Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1213900900:40"/>
It is a poor Foundation to raiſe Clamour
upon; <hi>viz.</hi> To ſingle out the vicious Temper
of the Poor, to exclaim againſt; when here
is a Vice in our Trade, that wants reforming
firſt, and which if an End were put to it,
would both do the Crown and the Revenue
Juſtice: It would block up the Door to any
more <hi>Dutch</hi> Cheats, (of this kind at leaſt) and
put it into our own Power to reform the reſt
with more eaſe; and till then, I doubt, it will
never be reformed, while we live.</p>
            <p>It has been ſuggeſted by ſome, (how weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we ſhall ſee preſently) that burdening the
Diſtilling Trade in <hi>England</hi> with new Dutys,
will be a Means to cure all the Evils which
they acknowledge ſeem to be growing upon
us, by the immoderate Uſe or drinking of the
Malt Spirits, among the Poor. If theſe Mens
Zeal for the Reformation of the People, was
no greater than their Knowledge of the true
Intereſt of their Country; they would never
propoſe a Method which ſhould only ſhut the
Door againſt the drinking our own Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
our Spirits diſtill'd at home, and open the
Door to a Flux or Tide of the ſame, or worſe
Spirits imported from <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſo bring
in <hi>Dutch</hi> Drunkenneſs among us too: which,
by the way, is yet ſomething of a worſe kind
than our own, feeding the Intemperance of the
People with the ſame or worſe Ingredients;
but giving the <hi>Dutch</hi> the Profit of it, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us nothing but the Poverty and the Crime.</p>

Had not this prepoſterous Notion ſtarted itſelf
into the World, juſt when theſe Sheets were in
the Preſs, and ſo fair an Opportunity was left to
anſwer and expoſe it, this Tract had not ſwell'd
to ſuch a bulk: but ſince the Politicks of theſe
Gentlemen have taken ſuch a Turn, and this
Flight of their Wit has carried them to ſuch a
height, I muſt treſpaſs a little on the Patience
of the Gentlemen, that ſhall ſee theſe Sheets, to
give in a Word or two, upon ſo weighty a Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</p>
            <p>All
wiſe Crowns, and ours of <hi>England</hi> in
particular, make it a Maxim in their laying
Dutys, <hi>never by loading their own Product,</hi>
to encourage Importations from abroad, in
prejudice of the ſame Goods manufactur'd at
Home. But if it ſhall be prov'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That burthening the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſtillery,
will only ſerve to encreaſe the Advantage of
Foreigners, and ruin the Manufacture of Spirits
diſtill'd from our own Corn at Home; how
will it anſwer the wiſe Maxims of State and
of Trade, which we all depend ſo much upon?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it ſhall appear that ſuch a burthening
the Manufacture at Home, will but encreaſe
the Frauds of Foreigners; and inſtead of detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the vileſt clandeſtine Commerce in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and the openneſt and groſſeſt Abuſe of
Parliamentary Bounty, with a leſſening to the
publick Good, which it was appointed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe;
wherre then will the good End of the
Parliament be anſwered; and how well are
ſuch People qualified for Politicians?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1213900900:42"/>
And if after all it ſhould further appear that
the Propoſal itſelf comes from a Quarter where
no ſuch ſanative Principles as theſe of preſerving
our Trade are to be found; but that it is all
from a View to ſeparate and corrupt Ends,
tending in themſelves to ſupport the Intereſt of
a Set of Men, who carry on a Trade a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times more pernicious to Trade and to the
Morals of the People than this: I ſay, if this
ſhould be prov'd by it all, then it muſt give
a new Turn to our Conceptions about theſe
Things themſelves; we muſt run 'em all over
again in our Thoughts.</p>
            <p>Let us then endeavour to ſtate the Caſe clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
among us</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Dutch</hi> do cheat, and impoſe
upon us already, moſt groſly and barefacedly;
or rather to put it right, the Exporters of the
Malt to <hi>Holland,</hi> do cheat and impoſe upon
us: (for if the <hi>Dutch</hi> are not the Men, let us
not wrong the Devil, but lay the Saddle on the
right Horſe.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. That by this Cheat, let who will be in it,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Diſtillers (for we are not talking
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> as a Nation, but as Traders, and
eſpecially as Diſtillers) are enabled to buy
their Malt for leſs than half the Price which
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſtillers give for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That by this means they are likewiſe ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to work their Spirits (whether the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
or other Spirits) for we are not now ſpeaking
of one ſort more than another, ſo cheap as to
ſell them one time with another for at leaſt 50
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1213900900:43"/>
               <hi>per Cent.</hi> leſs Price, than our Diſtillers can
work them for, from the ſame Materials.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That by the Advantages, Diſguiſes, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Kinds of crafty Ways which the <hi>Dutch</hi>
have, for diſpoſing and diſperſing theſe Spirits
among our People, under the Names of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Brandys, and by the Aid of Foreign Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
(for they always find the way to
make us the Tools of our own Deluſions) they
have an Opportunity to ſell that 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
dearer than we do, which they can make 50
<hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper.</p>
            <p>Let any conſidering Perſon take theſe Things
in pieces a little, and examine them ſeparately.</p>
            <p>All Errors and Miſtakes of Mankind, are
much better and eaſier prevented in Principle,
than corrected in Practice; as Fire is eaſier
ſuppreſs'd in the Sparks, than in the Flame:
The firſt and groſſeſt of all the Miſchiefs that
can be complain'd of in the Diſtilling Trade, are
founded in this Original Fraud of putting 13<hi>l.</hi>
of the Crown-Money in the Pocket of the
Exporters, for every Score of Barley which is
malted for their Exportation, whether to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
or any other Part, and for which they
pay 4<hi>l.</hi> Duty, and no more, or very little
more, as has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>Let us firſt ſee the Magnitude of this Cheat,
and then a little of the Conſequence of it:
Suppoſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> take off an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Quarters of Malt a Year for their Diſtille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
if I under-calculate it, the Gentlemen can
make an Allowance for that, upon all their own
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1213900900:44"/>
Eſtimations; and I doubt not but I ſpeak
much below the Quantity: But, I ſay, ſuppoſe
the <hi>Dutch</hi> take off for the Uſe of their Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Trade, one hundred thouſand Quarters of
Malt from <hi>England</hi> every Year;<table>

            <p>This Encouragement, were there nothing
more in it, is very conſiderable; and gives
the <hi>Dutch</hi> a vaſt Advantage over our Diſtillers
here at home, who pay this whole Duty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Draw-back, Bounty, or other Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
whatſoever; except it be, that they
alſo pay a heavy Duty upon the Spirits again,
after they are diſtill'd; inſtead of which, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſending their Spirits hither, by the help
of another Fraud ſubſequent to all the reſt,
have a Price for theirs ſuperior to ours, and
pay no Duty at all; and whatever Duty is paid,

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1213900900:45"/>
But after we have conſidered the heavy
Weight of 32500<hi>l.</hi> upon every hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Quarter of Malt, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> take
off, and the Diſadvantages which our Diſtillers
lie under upon this account, let us add to it,
what is mentioned <hi>p.</hi> 13. and undeniably made
out, namely, That the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
for them, draw off from us juſt two
and thirty Thouſand five hundred Pounds
Sterling more, upon every hundred Thouſand
Quarter of Malt they take off, and which is
done by the mere Craft and Fraud of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter,
as has been ſaid; which our Offices are
ſo ſupinely negligent in, as to paſs upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for Law; or our Officers ſo well inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
in as to connive at. I do not pretend
to enquire, whether it is Ignorance or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
let the Gentlemen concern'd acquit
themſelves of it as well as they can; it is equal
to the poor diſcourag'd Diſtillers, whether they
are oppreſs'd by one or the other; 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
they are oppreſs'd by it, be it which way
it will: 'tis the ſame thing, if my Houſe be

or a <hi>Rogue-Servant;</hi> the Houſe is burnt,
and I feel the Loſs, let it be done how it will.</p>
            <p>Not but that it may come in my way in this
Debate, to ſay ſomething of the probable Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
or at leaſt the Encouragements of theſe
groſs pieces of Fraud; and how a wiſe Nation,
as we are eſteem'd to be, or at leaſt think our
ſelves to be, ſhould come to ſhut our Eyes ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1213900900:46"/>
apparently to our own Intereſt, as to lie open
to ſuch Cheats as theſe are, and to be ſo abus'd
every Day; nay not to ſhut our Eyes to them,
but to be abus'd with our Eyes open, (for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this can never be ſaid to be a Secret)
if it has been practis'd ſo long, and never
ſeen before; we muſt have been as unhappy
in the Ignorance, as I think we are expos'd
in the Fraud of it.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Point, about loading the
Diſtillers Trade with farther Weight: I would
humbly recommend to thoſe Gentlemen who
have this Deſign under Conſideration, if any are
ſo weak, that they would firſt conſider of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading
it; and then they may put it into a
Condition to bear any Hardſhips they ſhall
afterwards put upon it, with the greater Eaſe.</p>
            <p>Let them unload it from the dead Weight,
which theſe clandeſtine Practices are not to
the Trade only, but to the whole Nation; for
in ſhort, 'tis a Tax levied upon us, to give to
a ſet of clandeſtine Traders: whether they are
<hi>Dutchmen</hi> or <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> or any Men, where
the Malt is ſhip'd for <hi>Holland,</hi> 'tis the ſame
thing, 'tis a National Grievance, and a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
upon the Trade, which ought to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>All
Inequality of Burthens, is a Prejudice
to the fair Trader; in the Senſe of which
Maxim, it has always been the Care of our
Crown by an Equality of Burthens, to give
the fair Trader a due Advantage: Hence ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1213900900:47"/>
and clandeſtine Trade, is on ſo many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
guarded againſt, and by ſo many Laws
made criminal among us, tho ſo impoſſible to
be fully prevented.</p>
            <p>But here is a Law, which however good in
it ſelf, and intended with the ſame juſt View,
is unhappily, and by the Craft of a ſet of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
perverted, the Point of it turn'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fair Traders; and the greateſt clandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Fraud that ever was, (of its kind) prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
in <hi>England,</hi> is ſet up by its Authority:
So that the Cheat is ſupported by the very
Law that was made to prevent it; may, it is
founded upon the very Execution of that Law
of Equality, on which Juſtice was to have
been expected.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of an encouraging Draw-back, by
which the Conſumption of our Growth was
ſuppoſed to be ſecur'd, and in order to which
the Exporter to have the Benefit of all; the
Duty that was paid being return'd to him, he
receives 4<hi>l. per</hi> Score in one Article more than
ever was paid, and 2<hi>l.</hi> 10<hi>s.</hi> in another, more
than ever was intended.</p>
            <p>I have often heard it ſpoken of, with ſome
wonder, in <hi>England,</hi> how it came to paſs, that
in ſome particular Places on the Coaſts, the
Draw-back upon the Duty on Malt came to
more than the Duty it ſelf; as was alledg'd
once likewiſe in the Affair of the <hi>Salt-Duty,</hi>
and by which, as I have been told, a groſs
Abuſe of the Publick afterwards was detected.
Whether it was ſo in the Salt or no, and how
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1213900900:48"/>
it came about, is none of my Buſineſs: But
if it be ſo likewiſe in the Malt Draw-back, I
believe, upon a due Enquiry into the Reaſon
of it, ſome of theſe wicked Things might come
to light, and perhaps more than ſome People
are aware of.</p>
            <p>But to reduce all this to the true End for
which all ſuch Complaints ought to be made,
namely, the preventing the like; and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it to be detected and prevented, as we hope
it may, what are we to enquire next?</p>
            <p>The next Queſtion is, How would this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Abuſes of the Diſtilling? My Anſwer
is direct, in two Heads.<list>
                  <item>1. You would then have no Abuſes to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
but our own; whereas now all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
and Adulterations of Foreigners, are
put to our home-Account.</item>
                  <item>2. The Diſtillers then being, as is ſaid, again
ſecur'd and form'd into a Body, with due Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to act by, and ſufficient Encouragement, are
able to anſwer for all Abuſes of the Trade, that
is, they are able to anſwer that there ſhould be
no Abuſes committed, no unwholeſom Liquors
diſtilled, or ſold if they were diſtill'd.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This being the Caſe, there would be nothing
left for the Crown to be concern'd in, but to
prevent if they can, the Intemperance of the
People,</p>
            <p>Nor would ſuch a Regulation want its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
even in the Nature of the thing;
there are many Ways to encreaſe the Revenue,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1213900900:49"/>
beſides loading Trade with new Taxes. If this
particular Branch, clogg'd with Difficulties, and
oppreſs'd by Foreigners, Smuglers, and the
like, may be ſet free from thoſe Oppreſſions
and Weights, giving it room to encreaſe,
encreaſes the Revenue of courſe; whereas
while it ſinks under thoſe Weights, adding Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys
only ſerves to ſink it deeper, and ſo even
leſſens the Revenue which it paid before.</p>
            <p>This was the Caſe exactly with the late high
Dutys upon Pepper; while thoſe Dutys ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
the Revenue was devour'd, I think I may
ſay wholly devour'd, by the Draw-backs; and
all the Home-Conſumption of Pepper was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
by clandeſtine Trade, that is to ſay, by
Smuglers; whereas thoſe high Duties being
again taken off, the Trade return'd into its
own Channel, and the Revenue reviv'd which
was ſunk before.</p>
            <p>Thus if the Diſtilling Trade ſhould be
loaded with more Duties, while theſe Frauds
on the Foreign Trade ſtill remain unredreſs'd,
what muſt be the Caſe but this, namely, The
Foreigners would have all the Buſineſs, and the
Diſtillers might put out their Fires and ſit
ſtill?</p>
            <p>But I meet with another popular Objection
ſtill, and it ſhews a little from what Quarter
all the reſt has come. The Objection is this:</p>
            <p>That the Diſtillers pay too ſmall an Exciſe,
that they may pay a little higher Duty very
well, and that they do not pay an Equality
with the Brewer upon a Quarter of Malt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1213900900:50"/>
Now, tho this ſeems a little envious at beſt,
ſuppoſing we ſhould grant the Suggeſtion, as
if the Brewer was uneaſy that any Malt ſhould
be conſum'd but what ſhould pay as great a
Duty as that which their own Trade pay;
yet as it happens not to be ſo in fact, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the Objector ſo much the more, and
leaves us to gueſs (a little the plainer) whence
theſe Clamours at the Diſtillers had at leaſt
ſome of their Original. I ſhall enquire into
the Particulars preſently, but ſhall name ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Objection of ſomething a like nature along
with it.</p>
            <p>It is alſo ſaid, there is a ſudden and great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of the Brewing Trade in <hi>London;</hi> and this
too they would place to the account of the
Diſtilling Trade; as if the Diſtillers were riſing
upon the Fall of the Brewers; all which are
mere groundleſs Jingles of a few deſigning
Men, who would deſerve more regard if they
ſpoke truth, and as they are miſtaken, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
indeed little or none at all.</p>
            <p>It is true, we have not room here to give
a large and particular Anſwer to all theſe
Cavils; for ſuch we hope to prove them to
be and no more. But yet we cannot cloſe
this Tract without letting them know that we
have heard all they have to ſay upon theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Heads; which upon the whole, amounts
to but very little in Subſtance, tho much
perhaps in Noiſe and Pretences. The whole
may be briefly anſwer'd in the following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
reſerving a more full and particular
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1213900900:51"/>
Anſwer, as we may hereafter ſee occaſion.
But to take them as they lie:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſo far from being true, that the
Diſtillers pay leſs Duty upon a Quarter of
Malt than the Brewer, that 'tis evident they
pay <hi>more.</hi> And not to enter at this time
into a Calculation of the Particulars, here not
being room for it, this we may undertake to
aſſert, namely, That the Diſtillers pay near
12<hi>s. per</hi> Quarter upon the Malt they uſe,
allowing a juſt proportion for its being not
dreſt down to the ſame Fineneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the ſame Meaſure as that of the
Brewers.</p>
            <p>Whereas on the contrary, the Brewers, the
Dreſſing of their Malt being likewiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
do not pay above 8<hi>s.</hi> to 8<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> on
each Quarter.</p>
            <p>For let it be conſidered here what is obſerv'd
already in its place, and ought to have notice
taken of it on all occaſions; namely, that for
the Double-Beer, Pale-Ales, Stout, and ſuch
like Drinks, which the Brewers now run ſo
much upon, and in which they do not draw
near ſo great a length from a Quarter as in
the ordinary Brewing, they of courſe do not
pay ſo much to the Crown for the Exciſe;
nay, for theſe Liquors they may be ſaid not
to pay ſix Shillings <hi>per</hi> Quarter on the Malt:
whereas the Diſtillers always extracting the
utmoſt Spirit the Malt will put forth, and
paying as much Duty for the meaneſt Malt
as the Brewer does for the beſt, has an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1213900900:52"/>
Diſadvantage, and pays more for his Malt,
by how much the leſs Spirit he extracts from
it.</p>
            <p>This, as above, will require a more full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation,
and on occaſion ſuch an Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will not be wanting; but in the mean
time, thoſe who make the Objection know
ſo much of the Truth of it, that they are
able to ſave us the Labour, and anſwer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
tho at this time perhaps ſuch generous
Treatment may not be for their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>I go back then to the firſt Head, namely,
That there is a great and ſudden Decay of the
Brewing Trade. My Anſwer is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There has been no apparent Decay of
the Brewing Trade, one Year with another, for
above four Years paſt, to laſt <hi>Midſummer;</hi> what
Decay has been muſt be ſince that time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By conſequence then the great encreaſe
of the Conſumption of Spirits in <hi>England</hi> has
not been the Cauſe of the Decay of the ſaid
Brewing: for as that Encreaſe has been of three
or four Years continuance, why, if it decay'd
the Brewing Trade, was it never felt till ſince
<hi>Midſummer</hi> laſt?</p>
            <p n="3">3. There has been no proportion'd Advance
upon the Diſtillery ſince <hi>Midſummer</hi> laſt;
why then ſhould the Decay of one be occaſion'd
by the other, which has not felt the Effect of
it? If the Diſtilling had encreas'd in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
during that time, and that, ſo much more
than ever it had done before, then indeed the
Water of one Channel being found in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1213900900:53"/>
Stream of another, would account for the
difference. But as that is not ſo in fact, the
Deficiency muſt be from ſome other more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Cauſe, and that we ſhall ſee preſently.</p>
            <p>The apparent Cauſes of the Decay or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſtop of the Brewing, ſo far as the Fact
may be granted, (for it is not ſo mighty in
Fact as in Noiſe) are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The exceſſive Dearneſs of Hops the laſt
Seaſon, which was ſo heavy a Rent-Charge
upon the Brewer, that it really put a check
to their whole Buſineſs; and ſome of them
found it hard to furniſh themſelves with a
ſuitable Stock upon any Terms whatever: That
Difficulty has of courſe cauſed them to leſſen
the Quantity of Beer among their Cuſtomers,
as much as they could, when they came to
lay in their Stores.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dearneſs of Malt it ſelf, which by
the univerſal Badneſs of the Seaſon in all the
Malting Counties, has had an effect upon the
Malt as well as upon other Grain; this has both
leſſen'd the Quantity and advanc'd the Price,
ſo that Malt in particular has been 5 to 6<hi>s.
per</hi> Quarter dearer this Year than it was the
laſt. Theſe things have been ſo apparent,
and here ſo well known to other People as
well as to the Brewers themſelves, that 'tis
ſomething ſtrange they ſhould lay themſelves
open to ſo effectual a Reply.</p>
            <p>But this too will appear leſs ſtrange when
we ſhall add, that the K<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>ery of the Brewers
themſelves, to ſay no worſe of it, may have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1213900900:54"/>
ſome ſhare in the Reaſons for a ſudden Decay
of their Trade; eſpecially if it be true that they
have come into that bare-fac'd piece of Policy,
<hi>viz.</hi> To ſtrike their Work in order to leſſen
the Exciſe, and ſo make a joint Clamour for
promoting the Deſign. But of this we may
ſay more in its proper Place.</p>
            <p>But now, to put in a Word for the Poor, as
well as for the Trade, and ſo to cloſe this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
you muſt allow me to ſay, that were
it ſo that they had quite forſaken the drinking
Beer and Ale, and were wholly come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the drinking of Spirits, Brandy, Geneva,
or what you pleaſe; it ſeems to me they have
done not only that which their Anceſtors did
before them, but even what their Superiors
have ſeem'd to lead them into juſt now, by a
general Example. As follows.</p>
            <p>There has been for ſome Years, and ſtill
continues among us. a national Guſt or Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to drinking ſtronger and highe pric'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
than formerly; I do not ſay we drink
more, or more to Exceſs, that is a Subject of
another Nature, and however true, is not to
my preſent Purpoſe. But the Stream of the
Nation's Palate runs, I ſay, for ſtronger and
dearer Liquors. Let me begin at the Head.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ladys</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of Quality and
Diſtinction, not content with the uſual, and
as I have ſaid above, moſt wholeſom Dram,
call'd right <hi>French</hi> Brandy, now treat with
<hi>Ratafia</hi> and <hi>Citron,</hi> at a Guinea a Bottle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1213900900:55"/>
The <hi>Punch Drinkers</hi> of Quality, (if any
ſuch there be) not contented with the beſt
<hi>French</hi> Brandy in their Bowls, muſt have <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack</hi>
at 16<hi>s.</hi> to 18<hi>s. per</hi> Gallon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wine Drinkers</hi> of the better ſort, not
content with the <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Barcelona</hi>
Wines, muſt have high Country <hi>Morgeau,
O Brian</hi> and <hi>Hermitage</hi> Clarets, at 5<hi>s.</hi> to
6. <hi>per</hi> Bottle; and after that <hi>Champagn</hi> and
<hi>Burgundy</hi> at 7<hi>s.</hi> to 8<hi>s. per</hi> Bottle.</p>
            <p>The common <hi>Draft</hi> of Red Wine of <hi>Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
and <hi>Viana,</hi> tho all ſtronger than the <hi>French</hi>
Wines formerly drank, is not now ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for the <hi>Citizens;</hi> but they muſt be
<hi>made up</hi> (ſo the Wine-Brewers call it) with
<hi>Lisbons,</hi> with <hi>Alicants,</hi> and <hi>Bene-Carloes:</hi>
and the <hi>Oporto</hi> and <hi>Lisbon</hi> Whites, tho very
ſtrong, are turn'd out of Doors, for the yet
ſtronger <hi>Mountain Malaga.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To deſcend ſtill lower: Our common Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of <hi>Ale</hi> or <hi>Beer,</hi> are not contented as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
with the ordinary <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Beer,</hi> or
Porters <hi>Ale;</hi> but they are advanced, firſt to
<hi>Two-penny,</hi> then to <hi>double-Beer,</hi> and <hi>Stout;</hi>
and now to the ſtrongeſt North-Country <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and <hi>Tamworth Pale Ale; Dorcheſter</hi> and
<hi>Newbury Beers,</hi> and the like; of which
great Quantitys are brought up by Land Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
above 100 Miles, and for which, above
300 ſmall-Brew-houſes, have, as I am told,
been erected within theſe few Years, in the City
and the adjacent Parts; which Ales are ſold
from 6<hi>d.</hi> to 10<hi>d. per</hi> Quart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1213900900:56"/>
In like manner then, the Poor following
this unhappy Humour of the Rich, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves as willing to gratify their Palate,
only not equally able to bear the Expence, are
fallen into the old Dram-drinking Way, which
their Fathers practis'd before them; and which,
as it is eaſy to their Pockets, ſpends leſs of
their Time; and unleſs they pleaſe, no more
prompts their Exceſſes, than the <hi>Beer</hi> and the
<hi>Ale</hi> did before; and if I may give my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I think indeed not ſo much. And thus
I have brought down the Hiſtory to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Times.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe this Tract, which is already
ſwell'd to a larger Bulk than was intended,
with a few very ſhort Hints at the Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which the Diſtillers at preſent are under in
the Courſe of their Trade, and which they hope
to be deliver'd from, by the Juſtice of the
Parliament, and the Encouragements which
they have reaſon to hope for and expect.</p>
            <p>Some of the Diſadvantages they are under,
are as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That whereas all the Malt exported to
<hi>Holland,</hi> and from which the <hi>Dutch</hi> extract
the Spirits which they import upon us, draws
back the whole Duty, beſides a Bounty of
2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. per</hi> Quarter to the Exporter (not to
ſpeak of the Fraud mentioned above, and
which doubles both the Draw-back and the
Bounty) yet our own diſtill'd Spirit upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
draws back but 4<hi>l.</hi> 4<hi>s. per</hi> Tun of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1213900900:57"/>
the Exciſe paid, and nothing at all of the Malt
Duty.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Dutch</hi> are enabled exceedingly to
under-work and under-ſell the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſtiller
(even by our ſelves) and at the Expence of
our own Crown, whom they ſo many ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
in the ſaid Allowances.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That by the Advantages given to the
<hi>Dutch</hi> for the importing Brandy 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. per</hi>
Gallon Duty leſs than the <hi>French,</hi> which Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys
are alſo paid by the Importers, not by the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> they have an unreſtrain'd Liberty of
impoſing their Mixtures upon us, of a baſer
Kind; which Mixtures, becauſe they appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
come from abroad, and are called Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at the Cuſtom-houſe, our People are eaſily
perſuaded to take for true Brandy, whereas it
is very well known, that many times it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to our common Malt Spirits, and our
Diſtillers affirm, they are able to out-do even
the beſt of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> by the like Artifice, come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Rivers and Ports, or at leaſt into the
open Roads where our Ships ride, as in <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
Roads, the <hi>Downs, St. Helens,</hi> and
even into the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> up to the
<hi>Nore</hi> and the <hi>Hope,</hi> and there ſupply our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward-bound
Ships with their Spirits, or Brandys
(as they call them) not only for the ſaid
Ship's uſe, but alſo in Quantities for Trade;
for all which no Entry is made, or any Duty
at all paid: So that our <hi>Guinea</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
Ships in particular, which uſed to take
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1213900900:58"/>
in large Quantities of Liquors of our Diſtillers,
go away now with little or no Stores, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
to be ſupply'd by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the
<hi>Downs</hi> and other Places.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all great Obſtructions to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilling
Trade; and as they are withal great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes
upon the fair Traders in general, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to the Crown in particular, we cannot
doubt, but if fairly repreſented, the Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
ſhall have ſuch Relief, as in right and
juſtice they ought to expect.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe apparent Diſcouragements in
favour of Foreigners, and in favour of clandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Trade, they are unjuſtly attack'd with
Clamours and popular Pretences, as if their
Trade was a publick Nuſance, and ought to
be regulated by the Magiſtrates; ſuggeſting,
that their Liquors are unwholeſom, and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
Incentives to Vice, and tempting to the
Poor, to the Waſte of their Health, Money,
Time and Underſtandings; Things which tho
not worth replying to, their apparent Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being ſufficiently already expoſed, and as
all the Exceſſes of the People, either in theſe
Liquors or any other are founded in their own
Intemperance; the Diſtillers ſay, if they may
obtain ſuch Powers and juſt Authority, which as
a Company they once had, and ſtill ought to
have, and which other Companys in Caſes leſs
eſſential to the Health of the People now have,
ſo as they may be able to inſpect and regulate
the Trade as it ought to be regulated, they
would anſwer to the World for the Wholeſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1213900900:59"/>
of the Liquors they extract, and appeal to
the Underſtanding and Senſe of the moſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
Phyſicians, if unprejudic'd.</p>
            <p>As for the learned and worthy Phyſician,
who, if Report lyes not, is to be employ'd to
ſhow to the World the pernicious Conſequence
of drinking <hi>Geneva</hi> or Malt Spirits, and how
many Thouſands it has ſlain, we impatiently
wait his elaborate Performance; and to help
it forward, only beg he will not omit to prove
alſo, the few needful Particulars following.<list>
                  <item>1. That the Malt Spirits made in <hi>England</hi>
are much more pernicious than thoſe made
in <hi>Holland</hi> and ſent over hither, tho made
all from the ſame Materials.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Liquor call'd <hi>Geneva</hi> is mortal
in it ſelf, and that the Juniper-Berries put into
it are Poiſon.</item>
                  <item>3. That it is the Liquor it ſelf, not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Uſe or Exceſs of it, that does the
Miſchief.</item>
                  <item>4. That 'tis much better to be drunk with
Strong-Beer and Pale-Ales brew'd from Malt,
than with Spirits extracted from the ſame Malt,
tho it is the Spirit alone in the Beer and Ale
that intoxicates.</item>
                  <item>5. That Drunkenneſs by Ale and Beer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
no Health, waſtes no Time, ſpends no
Money, weakens no Underſtandings; and that
it is only the <hi>Geneva</hi> that does ſuch wicked
Things as thoſe.</item>
                  <item>6. That there are more People drunk with
<hi>Geneva</hi> than with Ale and Beer, and that
a poor Man can be drunk for a Half-penny.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1213900900:60"/>
7. And laſtly, to clench it all, Let him
prove that more People die of drinking <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
than die of the <hi>Doctor;</hi> not failing to tell
to the World, where that formidable <hi>Geneva</hi>
Shop ſtands, that has ſlain more Chriſtians than
himſelf.</item>
