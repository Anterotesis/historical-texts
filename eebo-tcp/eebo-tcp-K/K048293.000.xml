            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE RIVAL CANDIDATES: A COMIC OPERA In Two ACTS; AS IT IS NOW PERFORMING AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</p>
            <p>By the Rev. HENRY BATE.</p>
            <p>LONDON: Printed: Sold by T. BECKET, corner of the Adelphi-buildings, in the Strand; and by W. GRIFFIN, No. 6, Catharine-ſtreet, M,DCC,LXXV.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE RIVAL CANDIDATES is an attempt of the dramatic kind, undertaken by the writer from no motive of literary vanity, but in order to introduce to the world, a young muſical compoſer, whoſe taſte he conceived might do honour to his profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The reformer of the Engliſh drama no ſooner was informed of him, than he kindly conſented to an early trial of his abilities, and diſcovered a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous anxiety for his ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The author arrogates to himſelf but a moderate ſhare of that univerſal applauſe with which his piece has been received, particularly when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects how much of it is derived from the kind attention of Mr. GARRICK, in the double capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of friend, and manager;—and what immenſe claims thoſe reſpectable perſons have, who fill his little canvaſs with ſuch credit to themſelves, and their profeſſion. To ſingle out any one of theſe celebrated performers, when all ſo kindly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined to produce, what is deemed a ſtriking repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in the comic ſtyle, would be a taſk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing as ungenerous. And therefore, as they have been equally zealous in their endeavours, as happy in the execution of their ſeveral characters, he wiſhes them, jointly to accept, the returns of a grateful heart.</p>

            <p>PERHAPS you were not aware, when you were kind enough to ſhew an early counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the following <hi>petite</hi> OPERA, that ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent an overture, entitled it in ſome meaſure to your future patronage; indeed, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this circumſtance, you might probably have eſcaped the preſent mortifying ſituation, had not the author conceived, that his piece owes no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable ſhare of its dramatic effect to your taſte and judgment:—hence aroſe an appeal to his feelings, too powerful to be treated with ſilent indifference.—</p>
            <p>I mean not, however, to alarm your delicacy, by a recital of thoſe accompliſhments, which have long rendered you an ornament of the moſt faſhionable circles;—nor by recounting thoſe private virtues, which ſtamp you one of the firſt patterns of domeſtic felicity; facts however agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or inſtructive they might prove to ſociety, I decline enumerating, in compliment to female diffidence.</p>
