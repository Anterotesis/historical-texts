            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>ADVENTURES</hi> OF <hi>Captain</hi> Robert Boyle, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> WAS born at a Sea-Port call'd <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire.</hi> My Father was Captain and Owner of a Merchant-Ship that traded to the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> but was caſt away homeward-bound upon the Rocks of <hi>Silly,</hi> and but one Man ſav'd of his whole Crew. My Mother and I were at an Aunt's in <hi>London</hi> when the unhappy News of my Father's Death arriv'd.</p>
            <p>I was too young to feel my Loſs; but my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Grief ſoon broke her Heart, and left me a poor helpleſs Orphan not ten Years of Age. It's true, I had a tender Aunt that was in pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty good Circumſtances, who took Care of my Education. I ſoon learnt to read, and write a good Hand; I underſtood a little <hi>Latin,</hi> and was perfect Maſter of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, which I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0388100100:11"/>
had been learning from my Infancy; my Mother being born at <hi>Paris,</hi> where my Father marry'd her very young, and brought her to reſide at <hi>Boſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By that time I had reach'd Fourteen Years of Age, my Aunt told me it was Time for me to think of ſome Trade, deſiring me to chuſe what I lik'd beſt, and ſhe would provide for me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Said ſhe, If I might adviſe you, I would have you ſtudy the <hi>Law,</hi> under the Tuition of your Uncle—; But I told her I did not much care for any Calling that muſt owe its Proſperity to the Misfortune of others. And at laſt I choſe that of a Watchmaker, as imagining my ſelf to have a good mechanical Head. Accordingly I went upon Liking (as they call it) and my Maſter and I agreeing very well, I was bound with the uſual Forms, and found civil Uſage from him, in reſpect of my Birth and the Misfortunes of our Family.</p>
            <p>My Aunt paid Forty Guineas (which was reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, at that Time, a great Price; but he was one of the Top of his Buſineſs) and beſides to find me in Cloaths and other Neceſſaries, during my Seven Years Apprenticeſhip.</p>
            <p>The firſt Half Year we agreed very well; but within that Time my Maſter had married a Wife of a pretty good Fortune, and a large Share of Ill-nature. In a Month's time ſhe began to tyrannize over my Maſter, as well as me, and ſoon prov'd, as the Saying is, <hi>The grey Mare to be the better Horſe.</hi> She brought it to that Paſs at laſt, that I was obliged to go on all her halfpenny Errands, and carry her Book to Church of a <hi>Sunday</hi> after her. I bore this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably well, but not without complaining to my Aunt, who advis'd me to make my ſelf as eaſy as I could, for ſhe fear'd Speaking would do no good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0388100100:12"/>
I went on this Way for a whole Year, and then to compleat my Misfortunes, my poor Aunt died of a Dropſy. This indeed was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Shock of all my Life; for while ſhe liv'd I felt no want of Father or Mother. She left me 800 <hi>l.</hi> and my Uncle—to be my Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. I ſhall forbear mentioning his Name, not out of Regard to him, but of his Children, who have prov'd a ſweet Grafting from a ſour Stock, and as good as he was baſe.</p>
            <p>My Shrew of a Miſtreſs continu'd her Ill-nature to me, and one Accident made her prove outragious.</p>
            <p>My Maſter had a vaſt Trade, and vented a great many Watches beyond Sea. One Day he had a large Parcel of them to go on Board a Ship bound for <hi>Lisbon;</hi> the Veſſel lay at <hi>Dept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and my Maſter was pleas'd to take me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him in the Boat.</p>
            <p>Before we were got to <hi>Limehouſe,</hi> my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter call'd to Mind that he had forgot a Silver Watch that he had purpoſely made for the Captain of the Ship. He landed me at <hi>Ratcliff-Croſs,</hi> and deſir'd I would be expeditious in going (for the Tide running downwards I could get to the <hi>Exchange</hi> ſooner on Foot than by Water againſt the Stream) then to take Boat at <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> and follow him to the Ship.</p>
            <p>I ran almoſt all the Way, and I believe got to the <hi>Exchange</hi> in half an Hour. When I came home, I found no Body in the Shop but my Fellow-Prentice, who inform'd me my Miſtreſs was above. I went immediately up Stairs for the Watch (for my Maſter told me he had left it in his own Room, being he had wore it ſeveral Days to prove the going of it) but found the Door ſhut. Standing a Moment to conſider, I heard a Man's Voice ſpeaking to my Miſtreſs,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0388100100:13"/>
in a low Key, and I ſoon underſtood by their Dialogue that Love was the Subject they talk'd of. I liſten'd ſome Time, till I found they had left off Diſcourſing, and were enter'd upon Action.</p>
            <p>Now at the Head of the Stairs the Maid had left a Step-Ladder, that ſhe had us'd in the Morning, in nailing up ſome Valens to the Windows in the Dining-Room, and there being a Glaſs over the Chamber Door, I had a great Mind to ſee who it was that was doing my Maſter's Buſineſs in his Abſence. Thereupon I fixt the Ladder very ſoftly againſt the Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot by the Door, and up I got; but leaning towards the Window in order to ſee into the Room, my Weight made the Ladder ſlip, and the Top ſliding againſt the Door burſt it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and in fell I into the Room, Ladder and all, with no little Noiſe.</p>
            <p>The loving Couple were mightily ſurpriz'd you may be ſure, and were in ſuch a Fright that they had forgot what they were a doing. But I ſaw enough to convince me that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was in a fair way to get to Heaven pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon my Miſtreſs's Account.</p>
            <p>After our Surprize was over, and every thing put in Order again between the Gentleman and Madam, I ventur'd to tell her my Errand. She gave me the Watch with a hearty good Box on the Ear, and told me ſhe wonder'd how I had the Aſſurance to come up without Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but, added ſhe, I believe you rather came upon ſome knaviſh Deſign, and had intended to rob your Maſter, if I had not been in the Room with my Phyſician, that came on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſee how I did.</p>
            <p>It was plain enough what Phyſic ſhe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, yet I made my Excuſe to her that I went to remove the Ladder, and it fell out of my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0388100100:14"/>
Hand againſt the Door and burſt it open; but I told her I was ſorry I had diſturb'd her, made my Honours and walk'd off, taking no Notice that I had ſeen any Thing. I took Water at <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> and follow'd my Maſter.</p>
            <p>In the Boat I began to ruminate with my ſelf, whether I had beſt keep this Accident a Secret, or diſcloſe it to my Maſter. At laſt, with many Pro's and Con's with my ſelf, I reſolv'd to acquaint him with it; partly to be reveng'd on my Miſtreſs for the Blow ſhe ſtruck me, and on the other ſide not to let my honeſt Maſter be kept in Ignorance of her Uſage of him.</p>
            <p>When I came on Board, the Captain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me (with my Maſter's leave) to ſit down at Table with 'em. We din'd heartily, the Wine and Punch went merrily round, and my Maſter, the Captain, with two more that were Paſſengers, began to be in high Mirth; when Word was brought that the Captain's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (as the Meſſenger call'd her) would be on Board in an Hour to take her Leave of him. My Maſter upon this Meſſage began to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with the Captain; I wonder, ſaid he, that you Seafaring Men will venture upon Wives. Why ſo? reply'd the Captain. Why ſo! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd my Maſter, Becauſe in my Opinion it ſhould put you in Mind of <hi>Cuckold's-Point</hi> as you went by Water: Your Abſence gives 'em ſuch a Conveniency, that I believe few let ſlip the Opportunity. Why, anſwer'd the Captain, mayn't your Wife, even now, be doing you the Favour; has ſhe not Time enough, d'ye imagine? The Thing's ſoon done; and if they have an Inclination, Watching and Reſtraint will do no Good: Many an Alderman has been cornuted while upon <hi>Change;</hi> and I knew a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Wife that ſeldom went to Church, but took
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0388100100:15"/>
Time by the Forelock, and while the Husband (good Man) was taking Care of his Flock, the good Woman at Home was at her Occupation with her Gallant, a rich young Farmer. But the Parſon one Afternoon being taken ſuddenly ill with a Giddineſs in his Head, was convey'd Home before he had begun his Work, and there ſoon found the Occaſion of his Pain; for he had been breeding Horns, as Children breed Teeth, a little unkindly. But however, the Parſon having Witneſſes enough of his Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Herd of Cuckolds, went to Law with the Farmer, and recover'd 500 <hi>l.</hi> Damages; and yet he has been heard often to ſay, that his Wife's Tenement was never the worſe.</p>
            <p>This Story occaſion'd ſome other much to the ſame Purpoſe: At laſt my Maſter and I, (the Tide being turn'd,) took our Leaves of the Company, and wiſh'd 'em a good Voyage. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by <hi>Cuckold's-Point,</hi> my Maſter cry'd, <hi>Robin,</hi> why don't you pull off your Hat to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the Window yonder? I pull'd off my Hat very orderly, but ſaw no Body; at which my Maſter fell into a great Fit of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and cry'd I had been very courteous to the Horns. I then, underſtanding his Meaning, told him, that it was only for marry'd Men to ſhew their Complaiſance that way; and, being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle piqu'd at the Affront I thought put upon me, ſaid I believ'd moſt marry'd Men were, or would be in the Liſt of Cuckolds. Why, how now, Sirrah! reply'd my Maſter, d'ye think I am, or ſhall be a Cuckold? Why truly, ſaid I, Sir, I have but little Reaſon to believe my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs a Saint more than any other Woman; and to inform you farther of what I have ſeen to Day, I beg you would be pleas'd to go to ſome Publick Houſe, that we may not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0388100100:16"/>
by the Watermen. My Maſter's Colour began to change upon this; and being very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to be inform'd of what I knew, order'd the Waterman to land at <hi>Ratcliff-Croſs,</hi> and wait a while.</p>
            <p>We went to the <hi>Ship</hi> Tavern and had a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Room, where I declar'd to him the whole Truth. After many Queſtions and Anſwers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, I ſoon found he believed all that I told him, for he turn'd as pale as Aſhes, and the Tears ſtood in his Eyes. I then was ſorry I had diſclos'd it to him, remembring the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>He that is robb'd, not wanting what is ſtole,</l>
                  <l>Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.</l>
               </q>
After ſome Time being ſilent, my Maſter broke into many extravagant Words, and threatning Actions; and at laſt I ventur'd to tell him, I thought him in the wrong to grieve at what could not be called back, and I wonder'd the World ſhould unjuſtly caſt upon the Man the Ignominy which was properly due to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for her Licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>After ſome Time he began to be more calm, and made me this Compliment; <hi>Robin,</hi> ſaid he, I have obſerved in thee a more than common Underſtanding, Pr'ythee tell me in what Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ſhall behave my ſelf in this Affait. I thank you, Sir, ſaid I, for your good Opinion of me, and, were it my own Caſe, I would not take any Notice of it till I found her in the Fact, or ſuch Circumſtances that even ſhe her ſelf could not deny; and for theſe two Reaſons, 1. Whenever it comes to an open Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you'll have but an uneaſie Living; and 2. that ſhe may take it into her Head to deny
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0388100100:17"/>
it, and then the whole Weight of her Anger will fall upon me; and truly, ſaid I, I have too much of her Ill-nature already to bear any more with any manner of Patience.</p>
            <p>My Maſter reſolved to follow my Counſel, and intended to make his Wife believe he knew nothing of the Matter.</p>
            <p>My Maſter could not imagine who this Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſhould be, by my Deſcription, for I had never ſeen him before. We went to our Boat, and ſo Home. When we came in, my Miſtreſs ask'd my Maſter if <hi>Robin,</hi> meaning me, had been telling him any Stories. Stories, Child! an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd my Maſter, what Stories? he has told me nothing. Nay, no great matter, ſaid my Miſtreſs, but I gave him a Box on the Ear this Morning, when he came back for the Watch you had forgot, and I did not know but he had made ſome Complaint; but I am ſorry for it, and will make him Amends one Time or other. This ſhe ſaid ſo loud that I might hear.</p>
            <p>The next Day when my Maſter was gone to <hi>Change,</hi> ſhe came up into the Work-houſe, as we call'd it, up three Pair of Stairs, and took an Occaſion of ſending my Fellow-Prentice on ſome concerted Errand. When he was gone out ſhe ſat down upon his Chair, and look'd me in the Face for ſome time. Well <hi>Robin,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I am very much oblig'd to you, that you did not take any Notice of the Accident that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd Yeſterday to your Maſter; and to make you Amends for your Silence I give you this Broad Piece to buy you a Pair of Gloves, with this Promiſe, that you and I will never diſagree again. I receiv'd her Money, and told her I ſhould never take any farther Notice of it. She call'd me good Lad, and left me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0388100100:18"/>
My Maſter had not always an Opportunity of talking with me at home, ſo he appointed me every <hi>Sunday</hi> after Sermon in the Evening at ſome Tavern or other, that we might talk about the matter. At our firſt Meeting I told him the Story of the Broad Piece, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe my Miſtreſs and I had together. I ſhew'd him the Money, and he ſoon knew the Piece to be his Wife's from the particular Fairneſs of it, being the ſame he had ſome time ago given her for a Pocket-Piece.</p>
            <p>Now, ſaid he, <hi>Robin,</hi> I am fully convinc'd of the Infidelity of my Wife; for notwithſtanding your former Story, I had ſome faint Hopes it might have been a Tale of thine, rais'd out of Malice to thy Miſtreſs, from her indifferent U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of thee.</p>
            <p>But now to find out this Spark, that I may reak my Vengeance on him firſt; for, to own my Folly, <hi>Robin,</hi> I muſt tell thee I can't find I ſhall ever be able to hate this ungrateful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Some time after, my Maſter was pretty well convinc'd that his Wife had been with her Spark to the <hi>Mulberry-Garden,</hi> and my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had diſcovered who he was; he prov'd to be a young Attorney of <hi>Clifford's-Inn.</hi> The next Thing we conſulted about at our weekly Meeting was how to give 'em an Opportunity of purſuing their Amour at Home. In Order to this, my Maſter gave out to my Miſtreſs that he ſhould be oblig'd to go as far as St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s in <hi>Kent,</hi> to look after ſome Goods, that were landed there in order to avoid pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cuſtom for them, and he fear'd the Affair would not be ſo well manag'd if he was not preſent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tueſday</hi> following was choſe for the Day of his ſetting out. My Maſter gave me
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0388100100:19"/>
publick Orders to go to ſeveral Places in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to look after the Workmen (for there are ſeveral Trades belonging to the making of a Watch). On <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning my Maſter got on Horſeback, in Order (as my Miſtreſs and the reſt of the Family thought) to purſue his Journey: But he went no farther than <hi>Iſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and return'd, putting up his Horſe again; and went ſtrait to the Place of our Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as my Maſter was gone, my Miſtreſs call'd me up to her, and ask'd me if I had Time to ſtep a little Way for her. I told her 'twas impoſſible, being I had ſome Work to finiſh that I was oblig'd to carry out immediately. Then ſhe begg'd I would call her a Porter, which I did, and one of my particular Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, one well to paſs in the World; for a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Porter in thoſe Days was a very beneficial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, there being then no Penny-Poſt-Office. I told him what he ſhould do, that he muſt go to my Miſtreſs and receive the Letter, and then to an adjacent Ale-houſe, and wait till I came to him. Accordingly he receiv'd the Letter, and went to the Place I appointed. I did not let him wait long, but order'd my Matters as if I was going about my Maſter's Buſineſs, and went to the Porter. From thence I took him along with me to my Maſter, where we open'd the Letter, and found it as follows;—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Dear <hi>Tom,</hi> it's an Age ſince laſt I ſaw you; the Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold's gone out of Town for a Week, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meet me at the Old Place by Six this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening."</q> Here we were at a Stand, for we could not imagine where the <hi>Old Place</hi> was, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Mulberry-Garden.</hi> At laſt we reſolv'd to ſend the Porter to the Spark, and bring the Anſwer to us, to ſee if that would give us more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0388100100:20"/>
Light in the Affair. Accordingly he went, and return'd with his Billet; we made bold to open it, and found it contain'd theſe Words,—<q rend="inline margQuotes">My Life, I don't think the old Place convenient, being a Brother Lawyer has diſcovered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our Intrigue; therefore I'll wait on you before the Time, that we may concert Meaſures accordingly. I am glad your Beaſt is out of Town; we'll add another Antler to adorn his Brow, aſſoon as I have the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to ſee her who ſhall eternally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand yours.</q>—</p>
            <p>When my Maſter perceiv'd that the Scene was to be open'd at his own Houſe, he began to demur: But after keeping Silence a little Time, he ſpoke to me to this purpoſe. <hi>Robin,</hi> this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has in ſome ſort confounded our Deſign, for what I intend to act I would not, if it could be avoided, put in Execution at home, for fear it ſhould make too much Noiſe; for, added he ſmiling, tho' a Man has the Misfortune to be a Cuckold, yet he would not have all the World know it. I told him I was glad to ſee him ſo merry upon the Occaſion, but begg'd he would not keep the Porter any longer, for fear of ſome Accident. He thank'd me for my Care, ſeal'd up the Letter again, and ſent him away with it. When the Porter was gone, my Maſter order'd me to go home again, and obſerve how Matters went there, and as ſoon as ever the Spark came, to ſend the ſame Porter back to him with this Notice, <hi>That the Work was ready to carry home, whenever I thought fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had not been at home a quarter of an Hour ere my Gentleman came in a Coach; he went up Stairs, but did not ſtay a Moment, came down again, whiſper'd the Coachman, and drove into <hi>Cheapſide.</hi> I was at a loſs how to behave my ſelf,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0388100100:21"/>
but my Miſtreſs order'd another Coach to be call'd. When I found that, I ſent for the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and told him ſecretly that he muſt dog that Coach let it go where it would, and be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious in bringing me Word. My Miſtreſs came down in her Hood and Mask in her Hand, and went off in the Coach. I look'd after her as far as I could ſee her, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bſer'd the Porter to jump up behind the Coach I immediately went to my Maſter, and acquainted him with the Buſineſs. He hurried me home again, for fear the Porter ſhould wait for me, and order'd me to bring him, when he came, to the <hi>Pope's-Head</hi> Tavern, becauſe he would be nearer home.</p>
            <p>The Porter did not return in two Hours: He told me that the Coach drove to <hi>York</hi> Stairs in <hi>York</hi> Buildings, and there they got out and took a Pair of Oars; he went in another, and follow'd 'em till they landed at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and dog'd them into the <hi>White-Lyon</hi> Inn. There he ſtaid ſome time, to ſee if they intended to go from thence; he walk'd into the Kitchen and drank a Mug of Ale, and in a little time one of the Waiters came in, and told the Cook the Gentleman and his Wife had beſpoke a roaſted Fowl and ſome Fiſh for their Dinner, and had ordered clean Sheets to be put to air, for as ſoon as they had din'd they deſign'd to go to Bed, being the Stage Coach was to call them up at One the next Morning.</p>
            <p>I did not think it altogether ſo proper to take the Porter to the <hi>Pope's-Head</hi> to my Maſter, but went alone, where I found him with another Gentleman, a Stranger to me. When I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him an Account, we took Coach all together and drove to the Horſe-Ferry, <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> took Boat and landed at <hi>Lambeth.</hi> We all went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>White-Lyon</hi> the back Way, and I went
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0388100100:22"/>
to the Drawer (as we had before concerted) and ask'd if there was not a Gentleman and a Lady that did deſign to lie there all Night to wait for a Stage Coach in the Morning; he anſwer'd in the Affirmative, but added they were that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gone to Bed, that they might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to riſe in the Morning. I ask'd him which Room they lay in, for that I had Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of great Conſequence to communicate to him. Why that Room up one Pair of Stairs, anſwer'd the Drawer, and pointed at the Door. Well, ſaid I, fetch me a Pint of Wine, I'll drink a Glaſs, and then go and wait on them.</p>
            <p>The Drawer ran down for the Wine, and in the mean time I beckon'd my Maſter; up Stairs we went, I ſet my Foot againſt the Door, burſt it open, and there we ſoon perceiv'd the loving Couple playing at <hi>Rantum Scantum.</hi> I ſhut to the Door again, and ſtood Guard that no One ſhould enter. My Maſter laid faſt hold of my naked Gentleman, and with the Aſſiſtance of his Friend threw him upon his Back, clapt a Piſtol to his Breaſt, and ſwore he would ſhoot him if he offer'd to ſtir or cry out. Then my Maſter's Friend took out a Box of Inſtruments, and, with a Pair of Sciſſars for that purpoſe, ſoon depriv'd him of what <hi>Seneſino</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Italian</hi> Singers want, as well as our Spark. The Thing was done ſo ſuddenly, that I believe my Gentleman hardly knew his Loſs till he felt the Blood trickle about his Legs. He made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Attempts to get up, but to no purpoſe. My Maſter told him he had better be quiet, for fear he ſhould be worſe ſerv'd, (but in my Opinion that could hardly be.) The Surgeon (for it prov'd my Maſter's Friend was no other,) had all his Implements about him; he manag'd his Needle, his Plaiſters, and Salves, and finiſh'd my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0388100100:23"/>
Gentleman, and would have had him gone home ſomething lighter than he came, but he prov'd ſo weak with Loſs of Blood and the Pain toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he fainted away.</p>
            <p>My Miſtreſs had hid herſelf behind the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and did not ſo much as ſay one Word; but in all her Concern ſhe took Care to dreſs her ſelf, and when ſhe had done ſhe ſat upon the Bedſide next the Wall, and ſeem'd to be in deep Diſcontent.</p>
            <p>We had got my Gentleman to himſelf again by the help of the Drawer, who ſoon found how Matters went. When we had done, my Maſter ſaid to his Wife, Madam, I muſt confeſs I was to blame to diſturb you in your Diverſion, but I own my Fault, and will endeavour to mend it by leaving you together to ſolace your ſelves, and ſo I take my Leave.</p>
            <p>Upon this we march'd down Stairs, paid for our Wine, and went to our Boat that waited for us, and landed at the <hi>Still-yard.</hi> My Maſter was very uneaſie all the Way home, and we could not get one Word out of him. He went up Stairs, lock'd himſelf in his Room, and remain'd alone ſeveral Hours. I would have been willing to have diverted his Melancholy, but did not well know how I ſhould go about it.</p>
            <p>Near ſeven a Clock in the Evening he call'd me up Stairs, and ask'd me if I had heard any thing of his Wife. I told him no. Nay, ſaid he, if ſhe has any Shame left, ſhe will hardly attempt to come home again in haſte. After ſome time he went out, and did not come home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain till twelve a Clock. He ask'd me ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Miſtreſs, and underſtanding we had no News of her, went to Bed.</p>
            <p>The next Morning he order'd me to ſend the Porter to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> to learn how they behav'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0388100100:24"/>
themſelvos when we had left 'em. He return'd, and told my Maſter that the Gentlewoman went away as ſoon as ſhe found we were gone, and left the Gentleman there, who was ſo weak that he remain'd there ſtill, and had ſent for ſeveral of his Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon my Miſtreſs's Mother came to my Maſter, and they had a long Diſcourſe, and afterwards went out together. But I was never more ſurpriz'd in my Life, when he came home the ſame Evening with his Wife and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He vouchſaf'd to tell me the next Day that his Wife reſolv'd never to be guilty of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fault again, and by her Submiſſion and the Intreaties of her Mother, he had reſolv'd to take her home once more. Sir, ſaid I, if you can forgive her, no one elſe has any thing to do with it. But, added I, I fear I ſhall feel the Effects of her Diſpleaſure. No, anſwer'd my Maſter, that was one of my Conditions with your Miſtreſs, that ſhe ſhould take no Notice to you of paſt Tranſactions. And truly ſhe kept her Word, for ſhe would not ſo much as look at me.</p>
            <p>She continu'd very reſerv'd for a great while, and never went out but to Church of a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter End of the ſame Year my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter began to be out of Order, and the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian advis'd him to go into the Country for the Air; and accordingly he took Lodgings at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead,</hi> where my Miſtreſs us'd to go twice or thrice every Week to ſee him; and my Maſter told me (when I went of a <hi>Sunday</hi> to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to give him an Account of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Shop) that his Wife had been ſo tender of him in his Illneſs, that he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he ſhould never have any Occaſion to blame
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0388100100:25"/>
her Conduct again. I told him I was as well pleas'd as he was.</p>
            <p>About a Week afterwards my Miſtreſs went in and out very often, and feem'd to be very buſie, giving Orders to my Fellow-Prentice for taking her a Place in the <hi>Hampſtead</hi> Coach as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual. This happen'd on the <hi>Tueſday,</hi> and I ſaw her no more that Week.</p>
            <p>When I went to my Maſter on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, he ask'd me if my Miſtreſs was out of Order, being he had not ſeen her ſince the <hi>Monday</hi> laſt. Nor I ſince <hi>Tueſday,</hi> ſaid I, but I thought ſhe had been with you, for ſhe took a Place in the Coach in order to come to you that Day, and ſent out ſeveral Bundles to be carry'd; as ſhe uſually did when ſhe was coming to wait on you.</p>
            <p>My Maſter was ſo confounded with what I told him, that he did not offer to ſpeak for ſome time, and the Sweat ran down his Face like Drops of Rain. At laſt, ſaid he, <hi>Robin,</hi> I fear all is not well! My Wife has certainly undone me. Come, hope for the beſt, ſaid I.</p>
            <p>Well, my Maſter reſolv'd, weak as he was, to go for <hi>London</hi> immediately. We took a Coach, and ſoon got home; and there to our great Sorrow found my Miſtreſs had robb'd my Maſter to the Value of Five Thouſand Pound in <hi>Bank</hi> Notes and Money, with Six and Thirty Gold Watches and Seventeen Silver Ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her own wearing Cloaths. My Maſter at this Loſs ſunk down upon his Bed. I went and fetch'd ſome of his Neighbours and Friends to comfort him, while I ran up and down like a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to ſee if I could get any Tidings of the Thief.</p>
            <p>I went to give Orders at the <hi>Bank</hi> to ſtop Payment, but to my great Sorrow found the Money had been receiv'd four Days before. I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0388100100:26"/>
came back to acquaint my Maſter with my ill Succeſs, and found him alone and gone to Bed. When I told him I could not hear any Tidings of my Miſtreſs, and that the Money had been receiv'd, he cry'd, <hi>Robin,</hi> it is not the Money that grieves me, but the ill Uſage of my Wife; 'tis that has got to my Heart, and never to be remov'd till Death. I ſat up with him a great while, till he told me he began to be ſleepy, and ordered me to retire; but as I was going from him, he took me by the Hand, and bid me good Night. I found by his Pulſe that he was in a Fever, and begg'd I might call a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician; but he ſaid he ſhould be better on the Morning, if not he would ſend for one. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him willing to reſt, I left him and went to Bed.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I wak'd in the Morning, I put on my Gown, and went to ſee how he did; but found him ſo weak and faint that he had not Strength enough to lift up his Head. I was immediately running to fetch a Phyſician that liv'd hard by our Houſe, but my Maſter call'd me back, and told me it was too late, for, ſaid he, I feel my laſt Moment approaching. He order'd me to ſit upon the Bed by him, he took my Hand in his, which burnt like Fire, and ſaid, <hi>Robin,</hi> my Wife has kill'd me; I could have born any other Misfortune with Temper; if thou ever ſhou'dſt ſee her, tell her from me that I forgive her, and that I beg ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her Life; but alſo let her know that ſhe was the Death of me. I told him I would not have him talk of Dying for an ungrateful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that did not deſerve the leaſt Regard, but to chear up his Spirits and let me go for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. No, ſaid he, all Phyſic or Counſel comes too late;</p>
            <lg>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0388100100:27"/>
               <l>I've that within which baffles all their Art,</l>
               <l>Sure Means to make the Soul and Body part,</l>
               <l>A burning Fever and a broken Heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>He had no ſooner repeated thoſe Lines but his Speech fail'd him, his Eyes clos'd, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd only with a Sigh.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs I was inwardly ſhock'd, and the Spirit of Revenge roſe in my Soul againſt the barbarous Cauſe of his End.</p>
            <p>When I had a little recollected my ſcattered Thoughts, I went to a Couſin of my Maſter's that liv'd in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and deſir'd he would come and take Care of his Affairs. For my own Part I could not compoſe my ſelf for two or three Days: At laſt I went to my Uncle, and deſir'd he would let me have Twenty Pounds to buy me Mourning, (for I did intend to wear Black, that my melancholy Outſide might conform with what I felt within) out of Reſpect to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Memory. Mourning, <hi>Bob!</hi> anſwer'd my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, Why if thy Maſter's Friends won't give it thee, 'tis my Opinion thou ought'ſt not to think on't. Yes, Sir, added I, I think it my Duty; for tho' my Miſtreſs us'd me ill, my Maſter always was civil to me. But my Uncle told me in plain Terms that I ſhould not have a Farthing. I told him I wanted but my own; but he reply'd, when he thought I was of Years enough to manage my Money my ſelf, perhaps I might be truſted with it, but at preſent he would take Care of it for me.</p>
            <p>I was very uneaſy at this Affair, for it began to look as if he intended to cheat me of it, and I did not ſtick to tell him my Sentiments in a civil manner, but to no purpoſe. I left him with a very heavy Heart, and came home. I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0388100100:28"/>
went to Bed in the utmoſt Confuſion of Thought; yet notwithſtanding my Diſcontent, ſlept 'till Morning. I got up about ſix a-clock, with a ſcurvy Idea of my future Fortune. About eight, my Uncle's Man brought me a Letter from him, in which he begg'd my Pardon, and told me it was only to try my Temper. The Man gave me ten Guineas by his Order, and farther told me that his Taylor would be with me immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to take my Directions; and accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fellow was gone he came, took Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of me, and told me he would be ſure to bring my Cloaths home by twelve a-clock the next Day; and he kept his Word with me.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I had provided my ſelf with every Thing elſe with the Money my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had ſent me; and the ſame Evening waited on him to return him Thanks. <hi>Bob,</hi> ſaid he, I had only a Mind to try your Temper, and I find thou art Father's own Child, a Chip of the old Block.</p>
            <p>He would have me ſtay to ſup with him, and among other Diſcourſe he ask'd me what I did intend to do now my Maſter was dead, for he did not ſuppoſe I was Maſter of my Trade e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to follow it. I reply'd, I knew enough to recommend my ſelf to any other Maſter without paying any more Money. My Uncle reply'd, I need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not be in ſuch haſte, but take ſome Time to conſider of it, and in the mean while I ſhould live with him and be heartily welcome. And to make his Actions agree with his Words he gave me five Guineas more for Pocket-Money, and gave Directions for me to be with one of his Clerks, a good-natured young Fellow, that was a School-fellow of mine.</p>
            <p>I was very glad of the Occaſion, living with my Uncle in great Tranquility the ſpace of a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0388100100:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Month, and all the time he ſeem'd to be very fond of me, never denying me any thing that I ask'd him.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning before Church-time he call'd me to him, and (after many Profeſſions of Friendſhip) ask'd me if I had never done any Buſineſs for my Maſter out of the Watch-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Trade. I pretty well gueſs'd at what he meant, and anſwer'd him in the Affirmative. Very well, ſaid he, I muſt ſend you as far as <hi>Graveſend</hi> to-morrow about the ſame Affair; and if I executed my Commiſſion dextrouſly, he told me it ſhould be the better for me.</p>
            <p>The next Morning I got up, and my Uncle ſent me with a Letter into <hi>Pall-Mall</hi> to a Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of his, and returning with an Anſwer, found him taking his Leave of a Gentleman that look'd like a Sea-Officer. As ſoon as their Compliments were over, my Uncle diſpatch'd me away to <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſgate,</hi> and gave me Inſtructions what to do. I was to enquire for a Ship call'd the <hi>Succeſs,</hi> Capt. <hi>Stokes</hi> Commander, at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and then to follow his Directions.</p>
            <p>As I was talking with my Uncle, my Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow thruſt a Book into my Pocket, and told me that would divert me in the Boat, if I had not Company that I lik'd. I did not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what he ſaid, but went about my Buſineſs, got into the <hi>Graveſend</hi> Boat which put off up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inſtant, and had the Fortune to light of good Company, and one young Man that was going to the ſame Ship as I was.</p>
            <p>We were very merry all the Way with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Stories we told among our ſelves. We got on Board the <hi>Succeſs</hi> about two a-clock in the Afternoon, and the firſt Perſon I ſaw was the ſame Man that I found with my Uncle in the Morning. He took me by the Hand, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0388100100:30"/>
me into the Cabin, and ſet a Piece of Ship Beef before me. When I had din'd, he inform'd me my Things would be on Board immediately. I told him it was very well; not ſuſpecting any thing. Afterwards the Captain went out, and left me alone in the Cabin: I got up, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Cabin Window, found the Ship was under Sail. At firſt I began to be ſurpriz'd, but yet was ſo ignorant that I thought we were ſailing up the River. While I was ruminating on the Matter, the Captain came and told me my Things were ready for me, whenever I wou'd. I went out; but how was I ſurpriz'd when I ſaw my Trunk that I left at my Uncle's with all my Cloaths in it! I was in ſuch Confuſion that I had not Power to utter one Word for ſome time. At laſt, recovering out of my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, I ask'd him the Meaning of what I ſaw! Meaning, Child! reply'd the Captain: Why, what's the Matter? would you go ſuch a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as we are upon without Neceſſaries? What Voyage? return'd I. Why, to <hi>Virginia,</hi> reply'd the Captain. At that Anſwer I ſat me down upon my Cheſt and burſt into Tears, and had ſuch a Combat in my Mind that bereav'd me of the Power even of thinking for ſome time. The Captain indeed did all he could to comfort me: At laſt I fancy'd it might be only a Jeſt; but to my Sorrow found by all their Diſcourſe it was but too much in earneſt.</p>
            <p>The Captain declar'd that my Uncle had bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd with him for my Paſſage, and that I was to be deliver'd to a Relation I had in <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> upon the Continent of <hi>America.</hi> I ask'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Name, but he told me one that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er heard of before.</p>
            <p>When I found I was certainly betray'd by my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arbarous Uncle, I fell upon my Knees, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0388100100:31"/>
begg'd the Captain to put me on Shore, and I would find ſome Means to pay the Sum he was to have for my Paſſage. He anſwer'd, he was too well paid already to let me go on Shore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and further added, I had nothing to do but to make my ſelf eaſy, for I was not likely to ſet my Foot in <hi>Europe,</hi> till I had firſt ſeen <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I found it was to no purpoſe to intreat any further: It is true I had no Averſion for the Sea, but rather an Inclination; and if my Uncle had made any Propoſals to me concerning ſuch a Voyage, and properly prepar'd, 'tis ten to one if I had not accepted it. But in this manner to be kidnapp'd, for it was no better, and then the Dread of being parted with as a Slave when I came thither, ſhock'd me prodigiouſly. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally of an eaſy Temper, eight or ten Days pretty well wore off my Apprehenſions, and I began to be contented with my wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fate. I ſet my ſelf with all my Diligence to learn the Mathematicks, as alſo the Work of a Sailor, and quickly attain'd to ſome Knowledge I ſoon ingratiated my ſelf with moſt of the Crew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who inſtructed me in all they knew.</p>
            <p>I mention'd a Book my Uncle's Clerk put in my Pocket, as I left the Chambers that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was trepann'd, which for the firſt three or four Days I did not remember; but putting my Hand in my Pocket to feel for ſomething elſe, I took it out, and found in it a Letter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for me, which was as follows;</p>

            <p>This Letter made me curſe my Fate again; for if I had had the good Fortune to have read it before I was on Ship-board, I might have prevented my Uncle's Deſign: But it was my Deſtiny, and therefore I ſubmitted to it.</p>
            <p>We met with nothing in our Voyage till we came near the <hi>Canaries:</hi> When one Evening we heard ſeveral Cannons fir'd, as we ſuppos'd two Leagues from us. Our Captain alter'd his Courſe, in order to avoid a Rencounter with an Enemy; for our Ship carry'd but ten Guns and twenty Men, beſides Paſſengers. But notwithſtanding the Captain's Care, as ſoon as ever the Morning dawn'd and the Fog was clear'd up, we found our ſelves within half a Mile of a Rover of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary.</hi> We were all mightily ſurpriz'd, for the Gally made up to us with Sails and Oars, being to Windward of us. Our Captain advis'd us to ſurrender immediately, but the Sailors were for fighting, and were confirm'd in their Opinion upon Sight of another Veſſel bearing down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, whom they knew to be <hi>Spaniſh</hi> by her Colours. All our Guns were immediately brought to the Starboard Side, and every Body ready to engage, Paſſengers and all who were willing to preſerve their Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0388100100:33"/>
The Rover by this time was juſt upon the Starboard Bow, and prepar'd to board us. We had ſome Hand Granadoes on board, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Stores for our Fort at <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> and a Gunner as one of our Paſſengers. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſeveral Men into our Main-Top with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, and follow'd himſelf, and as ſoon as ever the Gally came near enough, our Men at the Helm bore away, and fir'd our Guns upon him, which rak'd 'em fore and aft, and did much Execution. Our Gunner above in the Top threw in upon them with his Granadoes, which we could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive put them into much Confuſion. But all this would not have avail'd, if they had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War bearing upon us. They did not make any farther Attempts to board us, but they fir'd their Cannon and gaul'd us with their ſmall Arms.</p>
            <p>I had gotten a Musket on board and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd it as I thought, for it flaſh'd in the Pan, and the Noiſe of the other Pieces deceiv'd me. I charg'd again, but then found by the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that my Piece had not gone off. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I was reſolv'd to fire it: I ſtood upon the larboard Gunnel juſt upon the Forecaſtle, to be as far from the Enemy as I could, and fir'd my Piece; but being double charg'd, and a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Jade, gave me ſuch a Bang that threw me over the Side of our Ship; my Foot hung in the Fore Change for ſome time, but ſtruggling (with my Head downwards) to raiſe my ſelf up, my Foot diſentangled, and I fell plum into the Sea.</p>
            <p>Altho' I had learnt to ſwim in <hi>England,</hi> yet the Fright, the Smoke and all together took away my Underſtanding, and I found by my Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that I had got within ten Yards of the Rover, and ſhe that Inſtant bearing away before the Wind, they did me the Favour to ſtun me
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0388100100:34"/>
with a Stroke of one of their Oars, and took me on board them.</p>
            <p>They row'd with all their Strength, and the Wind being in their Stern, they inſenſibly left the <hi>Succeſs,</hi> who flatted their Sails and laid by till the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship came up with her, and then we could perceive 'em both making after the Rover.</p>
            <p>The Captain of the Corſair was an <hi>Iriſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado,</hi> and as ſoon as he was out of Danger, he ſent for me into the Cabin, and ask'd me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Queſtions concerning our Ship, where ſhe was bound, and who I was, (for he took me for more than a common Sailor, being I was not in a Sailor's Habit.) I told him my Story, as I have related in the foregoing Sheets. He ſhook his Head, and, with a Smile, ſaid I was very ready at a Lie. Sir, ſaid I, I am ſo far from lying, that I jump'd overboard on purpoſe to come to your Veſſel rather than to ſtay with them, chuſing to be a Slave nearer home, than to go I don't know where with the Knave that trepann'd me: And to convince your Honour of the Truth (for I <hi>honour'd</hi> him much) here's the Letter which my Uncle's Clerk ſlipp'd into my Pocket in a Book, (for by good Fortune I had the Letter and Book in my Pocket when I fell overboard.) At rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Letter he was convinc'd, he ſaid, of my Sincerity; and thou ſhalt ſee, added he, notwithſtanding the bad Opinion is held of us <hi>Renegado's,</hi> that you ſhall fare the better for your Confidence in us. Sir, return'd I, this Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent may convince you that I thought very well of your Honour, for as ſoon as I ſaw your Honour upon Deck giving Command, I thought you had the Look of a Gentleman; (tho' by the By he had a damn'd <hi>Tyburn</hi> Face.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0388100100:35"/>
I clarkt him up ſo well (with <hi>your Honour)</hi> that he began to fancy himſelf a Hero indeed. He order'd my Chains to be taken off, (for they had done me the Favour to provide me ſome aſſoon as ever they had got me on board) and told me that if I would turn <hi>Mahometan</hi> I ſhould have Command under him. I anſwer'd him, I hop'd he would give me ſome Time to conſider of it. Ay, ay, Time, thou ſhalt have half a Year's Time to conſider of it, return'd the Captain. He carry'd me out upon Deck, and told my Story to his Crew, who were mightily pleas'd with the Relation, and ſaluted me after the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> manner, by bowing their Heads, and clapping their Hands acroſs upon their Breaſts.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral other <hi>Engliſh Renegado's</hi> that were Officers in the Galley, but moſt of the common Sailors were natural <hi>Moors.</hi> The Captain told me that he did deſign to make for <hi>Sallee</hi> with all the Expedition he could, for he had engag'd with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War the Night before, and had ſuffer'd very much in both his Veſſel and Crew: but he told me he would ſoon be out again, for he had another Veſſel ready in <hi>Sallee</hi> Road to put out to Sea. We had before Night loſt Sight of the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War, that had ſo lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed her from the Infidels Clutches; and we ſteer'd for <hi>Sallee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ten Days after we diſcover'd the <hi>African</hi> Shore, within five Leagues Weſt of <hi>Sallee</hi> Road; and the Wind favouring us, we anchor'd in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by Six in the Evening. The Captain went aſhore, but ordered me to remain on Board till the next Day.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs I began to have ſome Hopes of ſeeing my own Country again, but yet did
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0388100100:36"/>
not know how to bring it about; however, I reſolv'd to truſt Providence.</p>
            <p>The next Morning my Maſter ſent for me on Shore, by a young <hi>Renegado</hi> Sailor born at <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Chriſtian Name I learnt was <hi>Francis Corbet,</hi> but had exchang'd it for <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha;</hi> a good intelligent young Fellow, and one that was a perfect Maſter of the Mathematicks. The Reaſon why he did not accompany the Captain in this Voyage, was a violent Fever when he ſet Sail. I ask'd him why he could forget the Saviour of the World to turn <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan;</hi> he told me that he was only one from the Teeth outward, and he thought it better to truſt God with his Soul, than thoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wretches with his Body. I thought it was a pretty free Declaration to one that was an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Stranger to him.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we were landed, I had the whole Town of <hi>Sallee</hi> ſtaring at me; for the Captain of the Rover had taken Care to ſpread my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among 'em; and I had as much Reſpect ſhown me by the People of the Town as he had. He took me home to his own Houſe, and us'd me with much Civility for a Week or ten Days; during that time he had carry'd me twice or thrice to his Country Houſe, about ſix Miles up the River. It was a very pleaſant Place, ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a little Wood, with the River running round it, and no approaching to it but over a Draw-bridge. At this Houſe his Wives liv'd, for I was inform'd he had ſeveral.</p>
            <p>Obſerving his Garden, I told him it was but indifferently kept. He anſwer'd it was for want of a Gardener, none of his Slaves underſtanding that Art. I offer'd him my Service, but told him I did not pretend to be a Gardiner, but I was aſſur'd I could ſoon make Amendment to it,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0388100100:37"/>
with the Help of ſome of his Servants. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd me to take as many as I thought fit, and, added he, becauſe I am impatient to ſee it in a better condition, I'll leave you here. I told him I begg'd to be excus'd now, becauſe I ſhould want ſeveral Things for my Deſigns. If it be Tools, ſaid he, or Seeds of all Sorts, I have 'em here. Upon which he carry'd me into a little Houſe, meant for a Green-houſe, where I found every Thing that was wanting, with a large Quantity of <hi>European</hi> Seeds and Roots. I told him I was ſatisfy'd there was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that I ſhould want. The Captain order'd me a Bed to be made in the Green-houſe, and an old Eunuch, that underſtood <hi>French</hi> very well, to wait on me, with a ſtrict Order that I ſhould have every Thing I ask'd for, but I was not to approach the Houſe in his Abſence upon any Account. I told him I had no Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity that way, and did not doubt but I ſhould ſhow him ſomething that would pleaſe him the next time he came, which was to be in 20 Days.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was gone I went to Work, (for Gardening was what I always took delight in, both Theoric and Practic.)</p>
            <p>I drew out Plans, order'd my Workmen, and in ſix Days time brought it into ſome Form. I perceiv'd in the middle of the Garden a Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Water, which I gave Directions to be drain'd, and found that it had been formerly a Fountain, but was only choak'd up with Filth by Neglect. I ask'd the old Eunuch if he had ever known it to play, and he anſwer'd in the negative, neither did they imagine it to be any ſuch thing; for his Maſter had bought the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of an old <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Renegado four Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and he told him it had been a Fiſh-Pond. I examin'd about the River, and found the Head
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0388100100:38"/>
of the Pipes ſtopp'd with Rubbiſh, which I clear'd, and by degrees the Water work'd thro' into the Fountain, and out again thro' another Conveyance. I obſerv'd that there had been Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures upon it, by the Pipes; I ask'd my Eunuch if he had ever ſeen any ſuch things: He told me there were ſeveral lying in a back Yard on the other Side the Houſe. I went with him, and found four ſmall Figures of <hi>Tritons,</hi> and a <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> in his Chariot drawn by Sea-Horſes. I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them to be brought to the Fountain, and fixt them on, (firſt ſtopping the Water) and then letting it looſe again finiſh'd my Fountain, which plaid admirably out of the Shells of the <hi>Tritons,</hi> (which they ſeem'd to blow with) from the Noſtrils of the Horſes, and the Trident of the <hi>Neptune.</hi> The Workmen were aſtoniſh'd to ſee with what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition I had compleated it, and imagin'd I had dealt with the Devil. The next Morning the Eunuch came to me before I was up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd I'd give him the Key of my Chamber, and be contented to be a Priſoner till he came to me again. I was a little ſurpriz'd, and ask'd him the Reaſon: He told me he could not give me any, being it was beyond his Commiſſion. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he lock'd me in, and went away. I began to ruminate about this Accident, but could not imagine the Cauſe: I had no Way to look out towards the Garden, being the Windows of the Green-houſe look'd over the River into the Wood, and the Back which front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Houſe had only painted Windows for Ornament, not Uſe. In about two Hours my Eunuch came and releas'd me, and we din'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I us'd all the Rhetoric I was Maſter of to find out the Secret, but to no Purpoſe; he only added that I muſt be in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition again the next Morning. This was ſtill
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0388100100:39"/>
more ſurprizing, and I began to think by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees I ſhould entirely loſe my Liberty. The old Eunuch imagining my Thoughts, aſſur'd me there was no harm meant to me. This Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon was my laſt Day's Work, and in three Days more I expected the Captain. About an Hour before Night I perceiv'd another Eunuch of the Houſe talking earneſtly with him that us'd to attend me, who immediately came to me, and told me he muſt beg me to retire to my Chamber that Inſtant; upon which I readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey'd, knowing it was to no purpoſe to contend.</p>
            <p>I was upon the Tenters to know the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my Confinement: Whilſt I was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Thoughts about it, I heard the Voices of Women. It ſurpriz'd me at firſt, but I ſoon ſound that was the Reaſon of my being made a Priſoner. When the Eunuch came to bring me my Supper, I told him he need not have made ſuch a Secret of what I was lock'd up for, for I had found it out; and then told him that I had heard Women's Voices in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Did you? (ſaid he, ſurpriz'd) I'll take Care they ſhall keep their Tongues within their Teeth for the future. He ſaid no more, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went out, and ſoon return'd and told me I ſhould hear no more of them. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with this odd Proceeding, and my Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity began to be more and more rais'd.</p>
            <p>When I was left alone, I began to examine my Room where I was, to ſee if I could find ever a Peep-hole; and by good Fortune found one made by Time and ill Weather under the Pent-houſe. I upon the inſtant of my Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very made all the Uſe I could of it, and ſoon perceiv'd three Women in the Walk with their Backs towards me. They were in a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0388100100:40"/>
with their Necks bare: One of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt ſeem'd to me to have a better Shape and Air than commonly the Women of <hi>Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> have. I don't know what came over me, but I ſeem'd impatiently to expect their nearer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. At laſt my Deſires were anſwer'd; for aſſoon as they had ſpent ſome Time at my new Fountain, they directed their Steps towards my Confinement, and when they were near enough, I could diſtinguiſh them to be three handſome Women; but one of 'em that ſeem'd to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry melancholy, ſurpaſs'd the other two, at leaſt in my Opinion. She ſeem'd to be about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fair to a Miracle, and much like an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.</hi> She did not ſeem to converſe with the other two, but follow'd them with an Air of Contemplation; and I could obſerve her ſigh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. I never till this Moment had the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any of the Female Sex, no more than good Manners and Decency requir'd; but I found my ſelf in a Moment full of aching Tenderneſs for this ſtrange Woman. Though I had no time for Thought till the Ladies were retir'd, I then began to reaſon with my ſelf, and found Love like Deſtiny was not to be avoided; and the more I thought, the more I was plung'd in this tormenting, yet pleaſing Paſſion. Yet I thought it was very odd to fall in Love, conſidering my Circumſtances. I had nothing to hope, and all to fear: I was poor, a Priſoner, and a Stranger, far from my native Country, in want even of Neceſſaries, and, to compleat my Miſery, ſunk in one Hour an Age in Love. Every new Thought ſeem'd a Thorn to torment me; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe Difficulties, a Beam of Hope would now and then ſhine thro' the thick Clouds of Deſpair, and encourage me to love on. From this Thought I began to think with Reaſon (if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0388100100:41"/>
a Lover can be call'd a reaſonable Creature) how I ſhould manage my Paſſion. I began to reflect the <hi>Moors</hi> were jealous of their Women even to a Degree, and did not in the leaſt doubt but my <hi>Iriſh Renegado</hi> had learnt that Part of their Manners. At laſt I pitch'd upon an odd Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: I determin'd to ſhew to my Captain an utter Deteſtation of all Females, (and in truth the Uſage my poor Maſter met with from his Wife, very much leſſen'd the Regard I ow'd the Sex) and try what that would do. This Thought ſeem'd to give me ſome Satisfaction, and aſſoon as the Eunuch came to releaſe me, I begg'd he would ſup with me that Evening. He accordingly promis'd me, and came immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with my Supper, and brought under his Garment a Bottle of excellent <hi>Greek</hi> Wine. I muſt confeſs I was ſurpriz'd and pleas'd; for as I knew the <hi>Moors</hi> are reſtrain'd from Wine, I did not expect any there. The Eunuch told me, ſmiling, that he had brought that Cordial to make me Amends for the Loſs of my Liberty; for though, added he, <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> are not allow'd to drink Wine, we very well know you <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi> ſeldom eat without it; and our Maſter (meaning the Captain) is not ſo ſtrict a <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> but he drinks much himſelf, and procures privately great Quantities for his own Uſe. I told him, I thought <hi>Mahomet</hi> order'd his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to abſtain from Wine, becauſe an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Uſe of it generally turn'd to immoderate Paſſions; but to take it ſparingly gave Health and Vigour to the Body, and Chearfulneſs to the Spirits. He agreed with me in my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhow'd he approv'd of them by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me. Notwithſtanding my Endeavours to hide the Trouble of my Spirit, my kind Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch took Notice of a Concern in my Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0388100100:42"/>
and chear'd me up with repeated Glaſſes; and imagining my Confinement caus'd that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, told me he would not have me take to Heart the ſmall Abridgement of my Liberty, for aſſoon as his Maſter arriv'd, I ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd any more; for the Cauſe would ceaſe, by the Confinement of the Ladies to their ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. I told him, with a ſeeming Joy, that I ſhould be mightily pleas'd when that ſhould happen, for I abhorr'd the Sight of them; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were my utter Averſion, and had been from my Infancy; and that Averſion was aggravated by the Knowledge of their Perfidy; and I thought it the greateſt Curſe could fall upon that noble Creature Man not to be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. Upon this I told him the Story of my Maſter and Miſtreſs, and ſeveral extravagant Tales of my own Invention, which painted that beautiful Part of the Creation in the Colour of the Devil. My Companion prais'd me for ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sex, and back'd my Stories with as many of his own Knowledge. Between our familiar Talk and our <hi>Greek</hi> Wine, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be very loquacious: He told me, his Maſter, after the Mode of the <hi>Moors,</hi> had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wives, beſide a Captive that he had lately taken, that ſeem'd averſe to his Paſſion, and all the Rhetoric he was Maſter of could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. He did not know, he ſaid, what Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman ſhe was, but ſhe ſpoke very good <hi>French.</hi> I imagin'd this could be no other than that ſweet Creature I had ſeen: I chang'd Colour; but to put it off ſaid, A Pox take all the Sex, don't let's talk of them any more. I am afraid, ſaid he, you love to converſe with the Men, and that makes you ſlight the Women. I did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately underſtand him, but he ſoon explain'd upon it, and then I was no longer ignorant. I told
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0388100100:43"/>
him it was of ſuch a beaſtly Nature, that I was of Opinion thoſe Perſons that us'd it ſhould be treated worſe than Beaſts. Why, reply'd he, it is ſo common here that 'tis reckon'd only a Piece of Gallantry. Well, ſaid I, I hate that Action, even worſe if it be poſſible than the Sight of the Female Sex. The old Man and I parted like two Friends; but before he went, I told him he need not give himſelf any great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lock me in for the future, for I would take Care of my ſelf. Well, well, ſaid he, and ſhook his Head, I believe I may truſt you. As ſoon as he was gone I went to Bed, not to Sleep, for I had Thought enough about me to keep me waking. I began to conceive a great deal of Hopes from my Diſſimulation. I ſpent the whole Night in thinking of a thouſand Expedients to forward my Deſigns, till I had thought of ſo many that they were all confus'd like a Skein of Silk pull'd the wrong way. At laſt with the Fatigue of Thought I fell aſleep till Sun-riſing, nor awak'd till I heard Voices in the Garden. I ran immediately and barr'd my Door on the Inſide, for fear of being diſcovered at my Peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole, huddled on my Cloaths, and ran up; where I ſaw my lovely Charmer reading in a Book, walking by her ſelf in the Alley that led to my Priſon. The other Women were got about the Fountain, admiring the playing of the Water. She drew nearer me; but what was my pleaſing Surprize when I heard her repeat the following Lines in <hi>Engliſh!</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>—My Grief lies all within,</l>
               <l>And thoſe external manners of Laments</l>
               <l>Are meely Shadows to the unſeen Grief</l>
               <l>That ſwells with Silence in my tortur'd Soul.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0388100100:44"/>
I muſt confeſs, the Tranſports I felt were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Expreſſion: She had ſuch a Softneſs in her Voice, and yet ſo muſical, that it made my Blood thrill thro' my Veins. In ſhort, during the time I beheld her, I was in ſuch an Ecſtaſie, that all my Cares were forgot. She turn'd up the Walk again, but I follow'd her with my longing Eyes till ſhe was out of Sight: I then turn'd them into my Imagination, and there beheld her ſtill.</p>
            <p>I was convinc'd ſhe was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, and kept in her Reſtraint againſt her Will. I ſoon reſolv'd with my ſelf to find ſome Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to let her know I would ſerve her all that lay in my Power, if ſhe was diſpos'd to accept it.</p>
            <p>I had ſtaid ſo long fixt at my Peep-hole, that the old Eunuch knock'd at my Door, which ſoon rouz'd me from my pleaſing Thoughts, and put me upon another Task, which was to diſſemble. I ſuffer'd him to knock twice or thrice before I let him in; at laſt I open'd the Door, when he had call'd to me to give me to know who it was: Aſſoon as he was enter'd, I began to exclaim againſt him in a friendly manner; ſaid I, You promis'd me Yeſterday that I ſhould not be troubled with the Tongues of thoſe Female Devils, and I have been ſo plagu'd with them for an Hour together, that I was oblig'd to ſhut my Door, and run up Stairs to be free from the Sound. He ſmiling told me, the Fumes of the Wine which he drank over-night had drove it out of his Thoughts, but he would be ſure to give them a Caution to hold their Tongues for the time to come: But then, added I, I may be ſurpriz'd by them when I little expect 'em. No, ſaid he, I'll take Care to ſend, or bring you Word when they are diſpos'd to walk
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0388100100:45"/>
in the Garden again. I thank'd him for his Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He told me he did deſign to come and dine with me that Day, for, added he, I ſhall not have another Opportunity a great while, for the Captain has ſent Word he'll be here to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row without fail. Accordingly he came with a roaſted Pheaſant, and ſome boil'd Rice, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with another Bottle of <hi>Greek</hi> Wine.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding my new Paſſion, I eat and drank heartily; but my Eunuch got almoſt tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, and the Fumes of the Wine getting up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Head, he deſir'd he might repoſe himſelf on my Bed for a while, which I granted him; well knowing if he had been found out, we might both have ſuffer'd for taſting the Juice of the Grape. I had much rather he had gone within the Houſe to have ſlept, for I could not even think to the purpoſe while he was there: But he ſoon got into a ſound Sleep, which I found out by his Snoreing. I then ventur'd to take Pen and Ink, and wrote the following Lines.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0388100100:46"/>

            <p>I had not the Conveniency of Sealing-wax or Wafer, therefore I folded it up, and directed it <hi>To the</hi> ENGLISH LADY. When I had finiſh'd, I began to have odd and confus'd Notions of the Succeſs of it: Perhaps, ſaid I to my ſelf, ſhe may be contented with her Fortune, or be afraid to hazard any Attempt towards her Liberty: She may alſo imagine I am ſet on purpoſe to betray her, and therefore to ſhew her Innocency may diſcover me to the Captain. I was in a hundred Minds: Sometimes I reſolv'd to burn the Letter; but at laſt Love prevail'd upon all my Reaſons to the contrary, and I reſolv'd to try the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of it the firſt Opportunity.</p>
            <p>In reaſoning with my ſelf, and writing my Letter, I had ſpent three Hours, and therefore I thought it high time to awake my Eunuch, who ſtarted up frighted out of his Senſes. When he had recover'd himſelf, he thank'd me for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Reſt, for he was aſſur'd he was wanted within. And he nick'd his Time to a hair, for before he was got half way the Walk (for I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately got up to my Peep-hole) I ſaw the Ladies at the farther End. He talk'd to them ſome time, and then left them, to go into the Houſe.</p>
            <p>They ſaunter'd about the Garden a good while, till at laſt two of them ſat down by the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady continued her Walk towards my Apartment. Now my Blood ran its ſwift Courſe, and the whole Frame of my Body felt violent Emotions. I thought this was a fair Opportunity, and yet was fearful to make Uſe on't. But muſtring all my Spirits, I ventured,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0388100100:47"/>
and when ſhe was within twenty Paces of the Green-houſe, I darted the Letter, and by good Fortune it fell in the Middle of the Gravel-Walk, ſo that it was almoſt impoſſible to miſs on't; but had it happened otherwiſe, I had time enough to run down and take it up before any one elſe could diſcover it. She continued her Walk, and when ſhe came at it, ſhe kick'd it with her Foot, once or twice, and at laſt took it up. She was reading in a Book, as ſhe was the Day before; I could perceive her open it, and ſpread the Note upon her Book, ſo that no one could tell but that ſhe was reading. It is not poſſible to expreſs the Anxiety I lay under all this while: But I began to be a little more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, when I obſerved her tearing the Letter into very ſmall Pieces, and ſcattering them in ſeveral Places of the Garden. She had not walk'd far, but ſhe return'd, and view'd the Green-houſe with a great deal of Regard, and, to my Imagination, wanted to come to the North Side of it, as mention'd in the Note, yet ſeem'd fearful; often looking back, and not fully confirmed in her Reſolution, at laſt went unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to the reſt of the Ladies. This gave me ſome Hopes that ſhe received the Letter kindly, and that I ſhould hear from her ſoon.</p>
            <p>I obſerved ſhe ſat by the Fountain very intent upon her Book, which did not much pleaſe me. In about a quarter of an Hour, ſhe got up, and came towards the Green-houſe again. When I ſaw her coming, I ran down Stairs, and fix'd a Packthread to the top of the Window, for fear if ſhe ſhould take Courage, and come to that Side, not ſeeing the Packthread, ſhe might be ſtartled, and perſuade her ſelf there was nothing in't. I had plac'd it, and got to my Peep-hole before ſhe had reached the South Side. But
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0388100100:48"/>
coming cloſe to the Wall, I could not ſee her by reaſon the ſmallneſs of the Hole cut off my Sight. But in leſs than a Minute I diſcover'd her walking back again, and ſometimes turning to view the Place of my Retirement. Aſſoon as ſhe had got to the Top of the Walk, (for I had not Power to ſtir before) I went down, and pulling in the Packthread, found a Piece of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ty'd to it. I unty'd it with a great deal of Expectation and Impatience, and found theſe Words wrote with a Pencil, upon a clean Leaf of a Book (which I ſuppoſe ſhe had torn from that ſhe had been reading in.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Was much ſurpriſed when I peruſed a Note, I found in the Walk of the Garden, as believing it directed to me. I confeſs I am a Perſon in Diſtreſs, but know not how to take the Word of a Stranger, and one I never ſaw, who perhaps is no more than a Spy upon my Actions, and what the Note contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be by Order of him who pretends to tyrannize over me, becauſe I am in his Power; and ſeeks this Way to find out my Inclination, for Pretences to uſe me worſe. Therefore I'll expect a farther Aſſurance in half an Hour from the ſame Place. And I'll take an Opportunity to convey my real Sentiments back again.</p>
            <p>The Joy I felt at reading this Note cannot be expreſs'd in Words. I ſat me down and wrote the following Anſwer.</p>

            <p>When I had wrote this I went to the uſual Place, and ſaw my Charmer very near me. I threw it down as before; ſhe readily took it up, and walk'd back again, tearing the Note when ſhe had read it, as ſhe did the former, and went into the Houſe. Juſt as ſhe was got within the Gate the other Eunuch came out (not my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eunuch) and as he was walking along, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him picking up the Pieces of the torn Notes. If any one had obſerved my Countenance at this Action, they might have diſcovered the utmoſt Confuſion there. I thought we were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly undone, and could not tell how to behave my ſelf. I ſometimes repented of the Affair, but yet I always found my Concern was more for her whom I lov'd, than for my ſelf. Aſſoon as he had pick'd up all he could find, he return'd, with my hearty Curſe, and Wiſhes that he might be obliged to ſwallow them down his Throat for a Penance.</p>
            <p>I don't know when I ſhould have recovered out of my fit of Confuſion, if the Sight of my Bliſs had not done it. She went to the Fountain, ſat her down upon the Margin, and ſpent ſome time there, then roſe and made to my Apartment; ſhe took two or three Turns with a Book in her Hand, but at laſt went out of Sight, as before. I ſtaid till I ſaw her in the Walks again, and then ran down, where I found another writ with Ink, as follows.</p>

He told me with ſome Intreaty at laſt, that all true <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> have a great deal of Regard for Bits of Paper, becauſe the Name of God, or their Prophet, may be wrote upon it; and they have a Tradition, that when they are called out of Purgatory at the Day of Judgment, to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ever-bleſſed Manſions, there will be no other Way to come to their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but over a large red-hot Iron Grate, which they muſt walk over Barefoot. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon the Inſtant as they are going to ſtep upon the Grate, all the Pieces of Paper they have pick'd up during their Reſidence in this World will run and place themſelves of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord under their Feet, ſo that they will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to get to their Prophet without much Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0388100100:52"/>
enough to ſpeak to her; Madam, ſaid I, I would not have you be under any Apprehenſion. If I had known you had been here, I would not have diſturb'd you. I will only inform you, that I am the Perſon that has vow'd to ſerve you to the utmoſt of my Power. Sir, anſwered ſhe, I am not at all diſpleas'd at this Interview which is merely Chance; on the contrary I am pleas'd to ſee the Perſon whom I once hope to be obliged to for my Liberty, and wiſh we could often meet, that we might conſult about the Means. Madam (anſwered I) if you'll condeſcend ſo far, I don't doubt but to find Opportunities enough. I told her of my Plot with the Eunuch, and I had ſome Hopes it might produce ſomething. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of my Deſign, and my Conduct hitherto. She added that ſhe would take hold of all Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to walk in the Garden (where I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd her I could ſee her without being ſeen) and ſo we parted for fear of being diſcover'd. She went into the Houſe, and I went back to my Dwelling, and in leſs than half an Hour the Captain arriv'd. He came to fetch me to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and told me I had work'd by Magick, or I could never have done what I did. He told me he thought himſelf much obliged to me, and that I ſhould find it. I anſwered him, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd it was but my Duty to ſerve him with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in my Power, and that if he pleas'd I would make farther Improvements. He made me a great many Compliments his way, and declared he would leave it to my better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>By this time Dinner was ready, and I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſit down at Table with him, (for tho' he had turn'd <hi>Mahometan,</hi> yet he eat as we do in <hi>Europe,</hi> not on the Ground upon Carpets as the <hi>Aſiatics</hi> and <hi>Africans</hi> do.) We had our Dinner dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0388100100:53"/>
after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Faſhion, and we drank plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully of his <hi>Greek</hi> Wine. He told me he had a Diſpenſation from the <hi>Mufty</hi> to drink Wine, and ſmil'd. I anſwered I believed the Crime was pardonable by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> if it was drank with Moderation. For my Part, I don't think (ſaid I) Religion conſiſts in Caſtigation and Penance; and I am convinc'd that an upright Man, let him be <hi>Jew, Turk,</hi> or Chriſtian, may find his Way to Heaven. We had ſeveral Diſcourſes at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner about Religion, but I ſoon diſcover'd the Captain knew very little of any; and I am of the Opinion there's very few of the <hi>Renegado's</hi> think of Religion: Their Motive to change is Eaſe and Intereſt. But this is a Digreſſion.</p>
            <p>When Dinner was over, we walk'd in the Garden, and I ſhow'd the Captain what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements I had deſign'd to make. He approv'd of every thing I ſaid, and inform'd me that he had heard from <hi>Mirza</hi> the Eunuch my Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Women. But he advis'd me to keep my Sentiments ſecret, for when you abjure (ſaid he) the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Women will make you feel their Reſentments. But 'tis odd, continu'd he, that one of your Youth and Make ſhould take ſuch an Averſion to the Female Sex. I told him I had very good Reaſons for my Hatred, and even my Mother was odious to me, tho' ſhe brought me into the World. Well but, added the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Time and a Fair Face may make great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations. I told him I was very well aſſured I ſhould carry my Reſentment to the Grave. I fancy (ſaid he) I have an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, a Slave of mine, that I have lately taken, would make you change your Sentiments, if you ſaw her. Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, I would be willing to ſtand the Tryal to convince you of the contrary, tho' I would as ſoon look upon a Serpent with my Will
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0388100100:54"/>
Well, ſaid he, I have not learnt the Strictneſs of he <hi>Moors,</hi> in keeping Women without being een; or if I had, your Averſion to them would onvince me I have not much to fear. He deſired me to walk a-while in the Garden, and he would be with me again immediately. Upon this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0388100100:55"/>
Time's expir'd, if ſhe will not conſent, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to force her.</p>
            <p>Lord (ſaid I in a ſeeming Paſſion) how can you take ſuch an extraordinary Trouble for a thing that does not deſerve the leaſt Regard. If the reſt of the World were of your Mind (ſaid my Captain) the Women would have but a ſcurvy Time on't. Now 'tis to me amazing (reply'd I) that Men ſhould take Pains, live hard, and run all Hazards, to come home, and ſpend all the Fruits of their Labour on ſuch Trifles, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have not the leaſt Tenderneſs for 'em, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in theſe hot Counties where Women are given to be amorous, and yet have but one Man to ſometimes a Dozen of them and more; when perhaps a dozen Men would hardly ſatisfy one Woman. Why (reply'd my Captain) that's the Reaſon they are ſo ſtrictly guarded, we pretty well know what they expect. Now, if I had not had this Averſion to Women (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd) I have a Secret without Witchcraft, to make a Woman doat upon a Man. How, ſaid the Captain, have you ſuch a Secret? if you'll let me know it, I will not only give you your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but amply reward you beſides. Sir, ſaid I, I thank you; but as for diſcloſing the Secret, it is what I never can do; yet 'tis in my Power to prepare you a chymical Liquid, which put into White-wine will do the Buſineſs, though it will take up a great deal of Time, and be very expenſive. As for the Expence, reply'd the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, I ſhan't value it. But in how long Time can it be done? Not under one hundred Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Projection, anſwer'd I. Upon this he paus'd ſome Time; A hundred Days is a great while, yet I think 'tis better to wait for her Conſent than to force her. So far (ſaid I) I think you are in the right; and further (added I) you may continue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0388100100:56"/>
her Affection, as long as you think fit, by now and then adding ſome of the chymical Drops into any Liquid ſhe ſhall drink, after ſhe has taken the firſt Preſcription.</p>
            <p>The Captain ſeem'd mightily pleas'd with my Project, and ask'd me what the Charge would be. I anſwer'd, I fear'd it would be about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds in this Country, tho' it would be much cheaper in <hi>England,</hi> where the things that I ſhould want were eaſier to be had; but I told him I could not give a juſt Account of the Charge, till I ſaw the Prices of the Things I ſhou'd want. I told him I was afraid I ſhould find it a difficult thing to get a <hi>Still,</hi> for that was the firſt thing I ſhould want. He anſwer'd me, he did not queſtion but I ſhould eaſily procure every thing I wanted for Money, and he would take care I ſhould not ſtand in need of that. He farther told me that ſeveral <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Sallee</hi> had all manner of Drugs, and he believ'd every thing elſe that I ſhould want. (For fear of the worſt) I told him, I ſhould not want my Drugs theſe fifty Days, tho' I ſhould want the <hi>Still</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and Liberty to go into the neighbouring Woods in the Night-time, being there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Herbs that I muſt gather by Moon-light, and when the Moon was in its Full, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, or Decreaſe, according to the Nature of the Herb I wanted. He told me I ſhould have all the Liberty I required, not doubting I would make any wrong Uſe of it. I told him, to be more ſecure, he might ſend who he thought fit, to guard me. No, return'd he, I'll leave you to your ſelf. But you may take who you will with you of my Servants, if you want their Aſſiſtance. I told him I ſhould ſtand in need of ſome of 'em ſometimes. Well, ſaid he, you ſhall go up with me, and take what Money you have Occaſion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0388100100:57"/>
for. So accordingly we went into a little Cloſet, where was a ſtrong Box, which he open'd, and took out two hundred and fifty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Piſtoles; ſaid he, if there is not enough, you may have more. I told him I was aſſur'd there was too much. Well, ſaid he, we'll reckon after the Affair is over. And becauſe it will be ſo long about, I'll e'en take another cruiſing Voyage, that I may not think the Time tedious. I was very glad to hear him ſay ſo, becauſe I ſhould have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opportunity to work my Deſign. Tho' I diſſembled my Joy, and told him I ſhould be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for that, for I ſhould often have ſomething or other to give the Woman he deſign'd me to work upon. Well (ſaid he) <hi>Mirza</hi> ſhall take your Directions. Upon ſaying this he call'd <hi>Mirza</hi> to us; <hi>Mirza,</hi> ſaid the Captain, you muſt obſerve this Perſon's Orders; whatever he commands you to do, you muſt obey with as much Exactneſs as if you were ſerving of me. This he told <hi>Mirza</hi> in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Tongue, but explain'd it to me in <hi>Engliſh. Mirza</hi> alſo told me in <hi>French</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion his Maſter had given him, and farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he hop'd I would often command him to viſit the Wine Cellar. I told him we would not want. I advis'd the Captain to let me go to Town, to enquire for the Still as ſoon as poſſible, and to be known to thoſe People that ſold the Drugs. Why if you will (reply'd the Captain) we'll go immediately; upon which I conſented. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Horſe to be ſadled for me, and I went into the Green-houſe to prepare my ſelf; and luckily for me I did, for I found a Note fixed to the String, which my fair Correſpondent had taken Opportunity of leaving, when ſhe walked in the Garden by the Captain's Order. The Contents were as follows.</p>

            <p>How lucky was it for me to find this Note! It might have fell into the Captain's Hands, and then we had been in a fine Condition. I had Time to write but a ſhort Anſwer, which I threw on the Ground, and pull'd in my String; it was this, <hi>Hope every Thing: Write no more till to-morrow.</hi> I lock'd my Door, and took the Key with me.</p>
            <p>When we were on Horſeback, our chief Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was concerning Charms, Philtres, and Witchcraft. I convinc'd him there was not any ſuch thing in the World; and my Compound was the only thing that could do what was deſir'd. He ask'd me if I my ſelf had ever try'd the Experiment: I told him more than once; and related the following Tale to him off hand.</p>
            <p>There liv'd in our Neighbourhood a rich old Man and very amorous, but deformed to the laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: He was round-ſhoulder'd, broad-fac'd, blear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eye'd, ſhort-noſed, and his Mouth as wide as his Face was broad; a pretty Object as one ſhou'd ſee. This old Gentleman fell in Love with a very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Woman, a Mercer's Daughter over-againſt him,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0388100100:59"/>
but ſeem'd to be the very Offspring of Pride, and nothing leſs than a Lord ſhou'd be her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, being well aſſur'd her Charms would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer every one that look'd upon her. She could not bear the thoughts of the old Gentleman, and whenever he talk'd of his Paſſion treated him ſo ill that he was almoſt diſtracted. I went to viſit him one Day, as I often us'd to do, for before his Love-Fit he was wont to be very good Company, and would make as free with his Deformity as any Body elſe would do; but I found him now in ſuch a Condition that I began to pity him. I us'd all the Arguments I was capable of to bring him to Reaſon, but it was the ſame thing as to ſtem a Torrent. At laſt I call'd to Mind this Elixir, which I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver try'd before this Occaſion; I was pretty well convinc'd of its Virtue from what I ſaw it was compos'd of, though the chief Ingredient is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd Gold.</p>
            <p>This wonderful <hi>Arcanum</hi> was found out by an Uncle of mine that had ſtudied the Secrets of Nature ſixty Years. When he was dying he call'd me to him, and gave it me in Writing, with the moſt ſacred Conjuration that I ſhould never reveal it, nor cauſe it to be wrote till I thought my laſt Hour near, and to deſtroy that which he gave me in ten Days, for fear it ſhould be found by Accident, and that ten Days would be ſufficient to imprint it in my Memory; I give it into your Hands, ſaid my dying Uncle, becauſe I find thy Underſtanding exceeds thy Years, and thy Averſion for Women will never let thee make an ill Uſe of the valuable Secret; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, that the Charge would deter me from doing it upon any ſlight Occaſion. I took it from him with a ſacred Promiſe not to diſcloſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it, till on my Death-Bed; for if my Uncle had
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0388100100:60"/>
recover'd I muſt have deliver'd it up to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: But he expir'd in half an Hour.</p>
            <p>I ſo far pitied the old Gentleman (and alſo having a Deſire to try the Experiment) that I told him I had it in my Power to make the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as fond of him as Love could wiſh, if he would go to the Charge. He told me he did not value the Expence, but he had no Faith in Charms. I convinc'd him at laſt, went to work, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd my Affair. The Quantity I made would ſerve a hundred Years, and I had a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in my Trunk when I was trepann'd aboard, which if you had had the good Fortune to have taken, would have ſav'd you Time, and Money.</p>
            <p>When I had brought my old Gentleman a Bottle of my Stuff, he ſeem'd even then to have little Faith in it; but I bad him have Patience till the Tryal. All he had to do was to convey about forty Drops in a Glaſs of White-Wine faſting. That, ſaid he to me, will be a difficult thing, for I know ſhe hates me, neither will ſhe ſtay in the Company where I am. However I told him I would do my Endeavour to find an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: So I order'd him to keep a ſmall Bottle in his Breeches Pocket, (for it muſt be warm'd naturally with the Heat of the Perſon's Body that is to give it.) And in two or three Days I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon a Relation of mine to invite the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to drink Tea with her: I acquainted my old Lover that he ſhould come in as by Accident, and bring a Pint of White-Wine as a Taſte of a Parcel he was to diſpoſe of. Every Thing happen'd as deſired; the old Gentleman came in, and got an Opportunity of conveying ſome of the Drops into a Glaſs of Wine, and I had the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſeeing her drink it. This paſs'd off, and we parted: But the poor Woman in leſs than ten Days was diſtractedly in Love with the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0388100100:61"/>
old Gentleman, who took his Opportunity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd her, and after deſpis'd her.</p>
            <p>Now the Nature of this Elixir is, that if the Doſe is not renew'd every time the Moon is in the full, the Object belov'd will ſink into dull Indifference again.</p>
            <p>My Captain told me he thought I might have made my Fortune by ſuch a Secret. I reply'd I had forgot to tell him that my Uncle made that one of his Articles, that I ſhould never ſell a Drop of it, and I aſſur'd him I would always keep my Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Our Story brought us to Town, and I was very much pleas'd, for I was both tir'd in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Lies to amuſe him, and riding after the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> manner, with one's Knees almoſt to one's Mouth; and there's no altering the Stirrups.</p>
            <p>We alighted at the Captain's Houſe; he ſent about the Town, and in an Hour bought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Still.</hi> He went with me to the Jew's that diſpos'd of Drugs, and by good Fortune, and a good Memory, I remembred the Names of a great many Sorts. I laid out ſome Money then, and told him I ſhould want a great many other Sorts, and larger Quantities. Of this Jew I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd a Crucible (thro' the Captain's Intereſt) to melt the Gold, as I told him. The things were order'd immediately to the Country Houſe, the Captain deſir'd I would make no Delay, ſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and got home juſt by Sun-ſet. I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ran to my Green-houſe to ſee if the Piece of Paper was there, but I found it was gone; this pleas'd me.</p>
            <p>I went to Bed and roſe early in the Morning, and ſeem'd to be very buſie about the Garden. I ſent for my Eunuch out of the Houſe, and told him what I had undertaken for the Captain; but I farther added, if he did not now and then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0388100100:62"/>
give me his Company, attended with a Bottle of the Juice of the Grape, I could not poſſibly go through with my Undertaking. He anſwer'd me, ſmiling, that he had Orders from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter not to diſobey me in any thing. But, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I, I have a harder Task than all this, for I am compell'd to have ſome Diſcourſe with the Woman I am to work upon, to find out her Temper; for according to her Diſpoſition I am to add or diminiſh ſeveral of my Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. Nothing could have prevail'd upon me, continu'd I, to have undertaken this hateful Task, but the Hopes I have of Liberty; for that is the Agreement between the Captain and me, if I ſucceed in my Deſign, which I am in no doubt of. I ſhould be glad, return'd the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, you might meet with what you deſire, yet I ſhould be ſorry to loſe your good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I ſhall with ſome Regret, anſwer'd I, part with you; but Deſire of Liberty, and indeed of revenging my ſelf on my unkind Uncle, which is natural to us Mortals, will make me as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious as I can in my Work. I order'd him to let me have a Couple of Servants, to go with me into the Fields that Night, to carry the Herbs I ſhould gather; and he told me they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend me.</p>
            <p>I now began to think of acquainting the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with ſome Part of my Deſign, and therefore wrote her a Note to this Effect.</p>

            <p>In leſs than an Hour I ſaw the Ladies coming down the Walk: I ran immediately up to my Peep-hole, and obſerved the Miſtreſs of my Heart ſauntring the ſame Way ſhe us'd to go. Aſſoon as I had diſcover'd her in the Walks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I ran down, and found a Note in the room of mine; (at firſt I was uneaſie, imagining ſhe had not taken mine away) which contain'd to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am ſomething reviv'd at your ſhort Sentence I found upon the Ground Yeſterday. I learnt your going to Town with the Captain by a Diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Achmat</hi> and <hi>Mirza;</hi> for I underſtand the <hi>Moriſco</hi> Tongue enough to pick out the Senſe of what they ſay: Yet I had not ventur'd to write, for fear my Note ſhould have miſcarry'd, if I had not ſeen you talking to <hi>Mirza</hi> out of my Window. Only conſider my Time is very ſhort, and if there is no other way to avoid the Captain, I muſt fly to Death as my only Refuge. Think of it, and Farewell. Let me have an Anſwer the ſooneſt, for Doubt and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation are but lingring Torments.</p>

She came to the old Place in an Hour after ſhe had brought the laſt, with another Note (as ſhe told me afterwards,) but reading mine, ſhe did not leave it behind her.</p>
            <p>After my Eunuch and I had din'd, I went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the neighbouring Wood with two of the Captain's Slaves that were Blacks: I loaded them with Herbs of ſeveral Sorts, any thing I could lay my Hands on, and order'd them to carry 'em into the Garden. I had taken Care to tie every particular Herb with a String, ſo that there was no Danger of mixing: Theſe I hung in Bundles upon the Branches of ſeveral Trees in the Garden, and out we went again. In ſhort, I gather'd a good Horſe-load of different Sorts, and ſome I laid upon the Banks, and others I cover'd with Earth, that it look'd as if I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Buſineſs. I could hardly forbear ſmiling ſometimes when alone, notwithſtanding my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety for the Succeſs of my Deſign, to think how ſoon I drew in the credulous Captain. Then I began to be in a thouſand Fears of his diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering my Intention to ſome of the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, for tho' generally ignorant, yet they would ſoon have found I was but an Impoſtor.</p>
            <p>While I was amidſt my Fears the Captain arriv'd, whoſe ſight gave me ſome Trouble. He came up to me, looking about him at what I had done; Why this looks like Work, ſaid he. Yes Sir, ſaid I, I am willing to begin, that I may make an End the ſooner: But Sir, I muſt intreat one Favour, that you would not impart the Secret to any one of your Family but <hi>Mirza,</hi> nor to no one elſe upon any Account whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: If they ſeem inquiſitive, tell 'em I am on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtilling ſome ſimple Waters for your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. I like your Advice, anſwer'd the Captain, and will be ſure to follow it: The Reaſon of my

coming down now was to take my Leave of you, for I deſign to ſet Sail to-morrow Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early, for I am inform'd of a rich Veſſel that will be in our Latitude in ten Days, from a Priſoner that's lately taken belonging to <hi>Spain:</hi> I can't tell how long I ſhall be out, but I hope by that time I come back, I ſhall find every thing in readineſs. Sir, I return'd, I don't fear but to accompliſh my Deſign before you come back. Well, ſaid he, do you think you ſhall want any Thing elſe? I told him, nothing but now and then a Gallon of Sea Water. Well, ſaid he, I ſhall leave <hi>Muſtapha</hi> behind me in Town, who ſhall obey you in whatever you ſhall command. Well, ſaid he, Farewell (and ſhook me by the Hand) I'll juſt go in and give 'em a freſh Charge concerning you, and then to Town again. I was very glad to hear him ſay ſo; and he was as good as his Word, for in half an hour he took Horſe: He ſhook his Hand at me as he went by me, and I heartily wiſh'd it might be the laſt Time we might ſee one another; not as I could complain of my Treatment, for he had us'd me very handſomely; and if it had not been in regard to the Buſineſs of my Love, I ſhould not have wiſh'd him ill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mirza</hi> came to me, and told me his Maſter had given 'em ſo ſtrict a Charge to obſerve my Directions, that if I had a mind to diſpoſe of his Eſtate, 'twas his own Fault, for we muſt not diſobey you. Yes, anſwer'd I, if ever you find me requiring any thing foreign to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, I'll give you leave to deny me; but there's one thing I muſt command you ſince I have the Power, and that is to come and ſup with me, and bring ſome of the Nectar along with you, for I am really fatigu'd with ſtooping and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sun when I gather'd thoſe Herbs.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0388100100:66"/>
Well, return'd <hi>Mirza,</hi> I believe I ſhall not find much Difficulty in obeying your Commands; and I have one Favour to beg of you, which is, that you will lay your Injunctions on <hi>Achmat,</hi> that he may partake. Said I, not to-day <hi>Mirza,</hi> another time with all my Heart. Nay, reply'd <hi>Mirza,</hi> it is not out of Love to <hi>Achmat</hi> that I deſire it, but that he may be as deep in Sin as my ſelf; for if he ſhould ever diſcover me, I can't tell the Conſequence. Well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd I, we'll find an Opportunity. The Hour of Supper being come, <hi>Mirza</hi> arriv'd with a couple of Flasks. We eat and drank ſo heartily, that <hi>Mirza</hi> was incapable of helping himſelf; but was ſo inebriated with Wine, that I began to repent of my plying him ſo faſt. I was forc'd to drag him, and lay him on my Bed. But how to conceal it from <hi>Achmat</hi> was my greateſt Care; for I did not doubt but he would be wanted; and accordingly it ſo fell out. For about twelve a-clock at Night he came, and knock'd at my Door. I was up, and thinking of my Deſign. I open'd the Door, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by his Signs, that he wanted <hi>Mirza.</hi> I let him know by Signs, that I had ſent him to gather me ſome Herbs by Moon-light. He was ſatisfy'd, and went back again. Now <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> kept the Key of the Gate, ſo that my Story was feazable enough.</p>
            <p>About four a-clock in the Morning <hi>Mirza</hi> wak'd, but frighted out of his Wits to find it Morning; tho' I ſoon compos'd him, by letting him underſtand how I had manag'd <hi>Achmat.</hi> He return'd me a thouſand Thanks, and told me, he ſhould never be able to make me amends. I ask'd him, how I ſhou'd order it to ſee this Woman, for I could not go to Work till I had convers'd with her: And yet by Heaven and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0388100100:67"/>
Paradiſe (ſaid I) I ſhall be more concern'd at the Interview, than at any thing which ever happen'd to me; (and that was but Truth, for my Mind was perplex'd between Hope and Fear, Joy and Anxiety.) I pity you indeed, ſaid <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and I wiſh I cou'd any way eaſe you of the Trouble. Well, ſaid I, then let her come alone into the Garden, as I am ſprinkling my Herbs by and by; for I think one Woman is enough to plague a Man. Oh (ſaid <hi>Mirza)</hi> all Men are not of your Mind. But I'll leave you, and hope to find you in better Humour, when I ſee you again.</p>
            <p>I had order'd a Slave to bring me ſome Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a large Quantity of Salt, to mix with it, only to amuſe 'em. With this I ſprinkled the Herbs I had gather'd, and I was very buſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nothing.</p>
            <p>I ſaw preſently after the Idol of my Soul, and <hi>Mirza</hi> running before her. When he was near enough to me to be heard, he ſaid, I muſt beg you to excuſe my waiting on you for a little while; for my not being in the Houſe laſt Night, as uſual, has let my Buſineſs ſo encreaſe upon my Hands, that I muſt make uſe of all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to regain loſt Time. I told him, I would not be his Hindrance, but was very ſorry I could not have his Preſence upon this Occaſion; for I ſhould be in a very great Dilemma. He made me no Anſwer (being the Lady was within hearing) but return'd into the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as the Coaſt was clear, I accoſted her with a great deal of Timerity. Madam, ſaid I, the happy Time is come, that I may tell you, without Fear or Danger, how much you may command me. Sir, (return'd ſhe) I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of your ſincere Deſire to ſerve me; and as I have wrote to you, in one of my Notes, if
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0388100100:68"/>
Heaven proſpers our Wiſhes, and we arrive ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>England,</hi> I hope it will be in my Power to reward you. Madam, (ſaid I) the Succeſs will amply reward me for all my Trouble; and as one Climate gave us Birth, it is my Duty to do all I can to ſerve you, if I had no other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But if you pleaſe, let us conſult, now we have Time by the Forelock, how we ſhall order our Affairs. Sir, reply'd the Lady, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd your Underſtanding wants not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; and if you pleaſe, I'll be rull'd by you in every thing. Madam, (ſaid I) have you any Objection to be diſguis'd in the Habit of a Man? for (added I) we may ſo accompliſh our Liberty with more eaſe. I have no Objection to it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Lady; but how will you procure it? Pleaſe to leave that to me (I return'd) and in leſs than ten Days I hope we ſhall be out of Danger. I then inform'd her of the Scheme I had laid, which ſhe mightily approv'd; and told me ſhe thought my Underſtanding outwent my Years. I told her ſome Accidents in Life new edg'd our Thoughts, and if we ſucceeded, the Inſpiration came from her. I obſerv'd ſhe bluſh'd at my Diſcourſe, yet did not look as if ſhe took ll what I had ſaid. But I was much concern'd to ſee her change the Diſcourſe. I did not think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I obſerv'd, by her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſhe had a large ſhare of Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and a happy turn of Wit. In ſhort, this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Look that ſhot through my Heart) as I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with your Company, but for fear we may be obſerv'd. I told her, I believ'd we ſhould not have many more Opportunities; therefore I begg'd her to be ready in a few Days, to leave this hateful Place. She anſwered me, that ſhe would wait with ſome Impatience my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and any Hour ſhould find her in Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. She farther added, that ſhe wiſh'd ſhe might be as ready, and as willing, at her laſt Call. I begg'd her to caſt off all melancholy Thoughts, and truſt to Providence. Upon which we parted; with this her Anſwer, that ſhe was ever reſign'd to the Will of Heaven; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould happen, ſhe would do her Endeavour to make her ſelf eaſy, even if it was the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of our Deſign.</p>
            <p>When ſhe was gone, I ſoon found the Sight of her encreas'd my Paſſion (if it was poſſible for Love like mine to ſuffer Augmentation.) But it was Love alone that work'd Miracles of old; it was Love that rous'd me from ſupine Slavery; for I muſt own once more, if it had not been for this fated Paſſion, I ſhould never have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any thing to regain my Liberty. But even my Love ſlumber'd now and then, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Diligence might wake, and I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to put the Deſign in Execution with all the Expedition imaginable, for fear of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. I went on amuſing the Houſe, with Variety of Works for my Preparation; and I was continually ordering the Slaves to Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for one thing or other, to ſtrengthen their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mirza</hi> came to me ſoon after. At his Approach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did my endeavour to put on a Countenance with little ſatisſaction of Mind, but I am apt to believe I did it but aukwardly. For as the Face is the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0388100100:70"/>
Index of the Mind, I am of Opinion, a Perſon of nice Judgment and Obſervation may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a falſe Paſſion, with as much eaſe, as a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller would diſtinguiſh the different Species of Stones (if we may call them ſo.) Well, ſaid <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> your fiery Tryal is over; but I perceive by your Countenance, your Chagrine would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly wear off, if you'd but ſuffer it. Why truly, ſaid I, I have two different Paſſions ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in my Mind, that is, Joy and Grief. I am pleas'd to think I ſhall ſucceed in the Affair I have undertaken; and yet griev'd that I muſt be compell'd to ſuffer the Torment I endure to help the Operation. Conſider the Reward (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Mirza)</hi> that is to follow. I chang'd the Diſcourſe, that I might not be put to the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak againſt my Conſcience any longer. I told him I ſhould be obliged to go to Town for Salt-water out of the Sea, and other Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that I ſhould ſtay for. Why, reply'd <hi>Mirza,</hi> you may ſend for Salt-water, without being at the Trouble of going your ſelf. I told him I was obliged to go in Perſon, becauſe I was to take it out of the Sea, when the Sun was in a particular Altitude. Nay, return'd <hi>Mirza,</hi> I am only concern'd upon my own Account, for I have engag'd <hi>Achmat</hi> to dine with you to-day, with a great deal of Trouble. Well, return'd I, I will not diſappoint you. I'll ſtay one Day longer to oblige you. He return'd me many Thanks for my Condeſcenſion, and went into the Houſe to prepare Things accordingly.</p>
            <p>All the while he was abſent, I was contriving my Scheme. When Dinner was ready, <hi>Mirza</hi> brought it in, accompany'd with <hi>Achmat.</hi> He had taken Care at ſeveral Times to bring Wine, and had plac'd it in a Vault in the Green-houſe. <hi>Achmat</hi> made his <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Honours, and we all
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0388100100:71"/>
ſat down. <hi>Mirza</hi> beg'd I would call the Wine a Cordial, that the Captain had given me. But I might have call'd it what Name I would, for <hi>Achmat</hi> did not underſtand me; for <hi>Mirza</hi> was my Interpreter, and with much Perſuaſion we prevail'd upon him to taſte it. But when he had drank one Glaſs, he ſeem'd to like it mightily, and ſoon ask'd for another; and in ſhort, ply'd his Hand to his Head ſo often, that he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to get up, and play'd ſuch Pranks, danc'd and ſung, and roll'd about, that it put us in a Fright, for fear ſome one ſhould hear the Noiſe he made. Which to remedy, I made him drink more, till at laſt he dropt down, and fell aſleep. We laid him upon my Bed, and did not intend to diſturb him.</p>
            <p>I told <hi>Mirza,</hi> now we had accompliſh'd this great Affair, I had a mind to go to Town even then, for the Sun ſhone, and perhaps it might not the next Day, and I was willing to take the firſt favourable Opportunity. He told me, what I pleas'd now the Jobb was done. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly Horſes and Slaves were provided me, and away I went for <hi>Sallee.</hi> When I came to Town I found <hi>Muſtapha</hi> at home, who congratulated me with the Favour I had receiv'd from his Maſter, and farther added, that he had given him full Charge to obey me in whatever I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. I told him I ſhould want his Aſſiſtance immediately with a ſmall Boat, only he and I, and I begg'd him to take his Quadrant with him, for I ſhould want his Art a little. We took the Boat he had provided me, and row'd out of the Bay till we came to a ſmall Promontory, where I deſir'd him to take the Elevation of the Pole. When he had ſo done, we lav'd Water into a Veſſel we brought for that purpoſe, and went home again. From thence I went to the

Jew's, and begg'd he would furniſh me with a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Habit for my preſent Wear; for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Country do ſo ſtare at me, ſaid I, being in a different Dreſs from them, that it makes me aſham'd. He provided me with a very handſome one, which I had pack'd up careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no one ſhould obſerve what it was. I bought ſeveral Trifles of him that I had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for, and at ſeveral Times other rich Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; but one thing particularly that I hop'd I ſhould want, which was a Pint of liquid <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I went to <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and order'd my things to be got ready: While that was doing, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſound him to know whether he had any Thoughts about his Liberty, for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred at our firſt Meeting he declar'd himſelf, as I thought, very frankly: But in all his Diſcourſe now, I found him of a wavering uncertain Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and therefore I thought it the wiſeſt way to keep my Deſign to my ſelf, and go another way to work. I took my leave of him, and went home. I unloaded my Horſes, and took particular Care of my Bundle of Things. My Salt Water I put into ſhallow Pans in the Sun, which in a Day's time produc'd ſmall Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Salt. I did not want to try Experiments, yet I was pleas'd to ſee the Operations.</p>
            <p>I began to ſet my <hi>Still</hi> on Work the next Day, but was ſoon interrupted in my Progreſs by the haſty Arrival of <hi>Mirza.</hi> Said he, we have brought a fine Houſe upon our Heads; yonder's <hi>Achmat</hi> won't be contented without more of the <hi>Francks</hi> Cordial [the <hi>Moors</hi> call all <hi>Europeans Francks.]</hi> I ask'd him how he order'd him when he wak'd, after I had left 'em; he told me, he was ſo greedy after the precious Liquor, that he drain'd the empty Bottles; and he believ'd if
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0388100100:73"/>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf had made him a Viſit, and <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat</hi> had got a Bottle to his Noſe, he would not have bid him welcome till he had ſeen the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Well, ſaid I, you know the Liquor is not mine, but I'll ſtand by you in the Conſumption of it. Well, if you pleaſe then, ſaid <hi>Mirza,</hi> we'll trouble you with our Company to-night. With all my Heart, ſaid I; ſo we agreed to ſup together. <hi>Mirza</hi> farther added, that the Ladies had a mind to ſee my <hi>Still</hi> at work. I told him they might do as they thought fit, but I would get out of the Way; and accordingly he went to fetch them. The <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Women came down the Walk in a haſty manner to obſerve it, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady came alone as uſual. I had got on the other Side of the Lawrel Trees, and took Care to appear in her Sight. Aſſoon as ſhe ſaw me, ſhe cautiouſly approach'd me, and told me ſoftly ſhe wanted to have a little Talk with me. I anſwer'd her, we had an Opportunity ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favourable; and then let her know how the other Women were employ'd, (beſide we had the Lawrel Walk between us, and I was out of Sight from every Body elſe.) She told me ſhe had ſomething particular to mention to me; ſaid ſhe, we ſhall certainly want Money to accommodate us with many Neceſſaries in our dangerous Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. I told her what Money I had ſav'd for our Deſign, but that we ſhould certainly have Occaſion for more, if we were oblig'd to go for <hi>Spain.</hi> That was one of the Reaſons, ſaid ſhe, why I wanted to confer with you: It is in my Power to procure a conſiderable Sum, and tho' it is not ſo much as I have loſt by the Captain, yet I have even a Scruple to take clandeſtine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him what I may ſay is my own juſtly. I ſoon remov'd her Scruples, and then ſhe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther told me, what was in her Power to take
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0388100100:74"/>
was chiefly in Jewels, which would be better for Concealment and Carriage than Money. By this time ſhe obſerv'd the other Ladies coming towards her, which ſhe inform'd me of; upon that I took my leave, and abſconded. When they were gone off the Walks, <hi>Mirza</hi> came to me to releaſe me, as he call'd it, and told me the Ladies were mighty well pleas'd with the View of my Work and Materials. I told him, I hop'd they would not give me that Trouble often: He anſwer'd, he would take Care for the future.</p>
            <p>Now the Criſis of my Project was very near. I went to Town the next Day, and took <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha</hi> for more Water; and farther added, I ſhould want him a Night or two hence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Water by Moon-light. He wonder'd at my Proceeding, but his Maſter had told him that I was ſomething very extraordinary, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected me of Magick; but he alſo inform'd him that I was uſing my Art for his Benefit. I told him I had ſeveral Materials to waſh in the Sea Water in the Full of the Moon (which was at that time) and then I ſhould give him no farther Trouble. From thence I went to my Jew's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and privately procur'd ſeveral ſorts of dry'd Proviſions, as Neats Tongues, Biskets, dry'd Fiſh, Wine, and a ſmall Puncheon of Water, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Neceſſaries, all to be ready at a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Warning.</p>
            <p>When I had provided every thing, I went home again, and got an Opportunity the ſame Day to ſpeak with my Miſtreſs. I deſir'd ſhe would be ready about twelve a-clock at Night, with every thing ſhe had a mind to take with her. She told me ſhe could not tell how to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the Vigilance of the Eunuchs, for, ſaid ſhe, they lock me up every Night when they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0388100100:75"/>
go to Bed; nay, every Day, when they are not with me. I deſir'd her to leave that to me. I invited <hi>Mirza</hi> and <hi>Achmat</hi> to ſup with me that Night, for I told 'em I was oblig'd to ſit up to watch my Work, being it was coming to a Head, and that I was to go to Town before Day. They comply'd with my Requeſt with a great deal of Joy; and the Hour drawing near, they lock'd up the Doors of the Houſe, and came with a great deal of Contentment in their Looks. We ſat down, and I ply'd them with Wine till they thought they had enough. For the finiſhing Stroke I deſir'd 'em to drink one Cup of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of my own diſtilling, which they ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with. I went and fetch'd a Bottle of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that I had procur'd on purpoſe, in which I had convey'd a large Quantity of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> to be ready for this Occaſion. I gave 'em each a good large Cup, which they ſwallow'd, but did not very well like the Taſte. I told them I had diſtill'd that Liquor on purpoſe to keep the Fumes of the Wine (or <hi>Cordial,</hi> as <hi>Achmat</hi> would have it) out of the Head. They were very well pleas'd if it would have that Effect, yet deſir'd another Glaſs of Wine to put the Taſte out of their Mouths, which I comply'd with. The Liquor ſoon had its deſir'd Effect, and a profound Sleep lock'd up all their Senſes. I with ſome Fear took the Keys out of <hi>Achmat</hi>'s Pocket, and went directly to the Houſe, and at laſt found the right Key that open'd the Place where my Treaſure was repos'd. Tho' ſhe found her ſelf at Liberty, yet ſhe ſhook with timerous Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. I encourag'd her all I could, and brought her the Diſguiſe which I had provided for her. While ſhe was getting ready, I retir'd out of Decency, and got out my Horſes, and an <hi>Italian</hi> Slave, whom I had two or three times
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0388100100:76"/>
taken to Town with me: He underſtood a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>French,</hi> and I had obſerv'd ſomething in his Countenance that ſpoke him worthy of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fate. I had not once mention'd to him any thing of my Project, for fear of any Accident, but I had order'd him to be ready to go with me that Night. When I came back, I found my Miſtreſs ready, and ſomething impatient. I inform'd her ſhe muſt ſubmit to another Diſguiſe. She ask'd me what that was: I took out a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of <hi>Ombre,</hi> and told her ſhe muſt permit me to rub it over her Face and Hands; which I did: But the Pleaſure of touching her Fleſh in that gentle manner perfectly put me in an Ecſtaſy, which ſhe obſerv'd, for I could not help ſoftly ſqueezing her Hand. She did not ſeem diſpleas'd at my Tranſport, but yet I thought the Occaſion ſhe had to make Uſe of me made her bear with me. Aſſoon as we were ready we went out, but I firſt lock'd the Doors and left 'em as I found 'em. My Mind was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd between Hope, Fear, Joy, and Terror, and I did not doubt but the Lady was in a worſe Condition; but all my Task was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her. When I had help'd her up on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, I call'd for the <hi>Italian</hi> Slave, and we both mounted, for I would not let him walk on Foot as uſual.</p>
            <p>When we were got ſafe from the Houſe, I began to ask the <hi>Italian</hi> Slave ſeveral Queſtions, as where he was born, how long he had been a Slave, and ſo forth. I found by his Anſwers that he had no Hopes of Liberty, for he had ſent ſeveral Letters to his Friends in <hi>Italy,</hi> and never could receive any Anſwer. Then I began to come nearer the matter, and gave him ſome Hint of our Deſign, but with this Addition, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Death ſhould not deter me from the Execution.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0388100100:77"/>
He had hardly Patience to hear me out, but begg'd he might ſhare the ſame Fate with me, and if he got his Liberty through my Means, he ſhould never forget the Obligation, but I might be Maſter of that Life I ſhould be the Means of ſaving; for, added he, to live in Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is but to be always dying the worſt of Deaths. I ſoon found by his manner of expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he was ſincere in what he ſaid. At laſt I told him all my Deſign; which he mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approv'd of, and ſaid every thing was ſo well concerted, that with the Bleſſing of God it could not miſcarry.</p>
            <p>When we arriv'd at the Captain's Town Houſe, we found <hi>Muſtapha</hi> waiting for me. I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd we could not do without him, yet I would not venture to mention our Eſcape, till we had him ſafe upon the Sea. I order'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing into the Boat, and to hide my diſguis'd Lady, I told <hi>Muſtapha</hi> that it was a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that had been bit by a mad Dog, and I had brought him to dip him in the Sea, by the Deſire of his Friends that liv'd in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood in the Country, which was allow'd to be the only Cure.</p>
            <p>When we had gain'd the main Sea, I began to open my Deſign to <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> but was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſurpriz'd to hear him call out for Help. I immediately drew a Piſtol out of my Pocket (for I had procur'd ſeveral Pair) held it to his Breaſt, and threaten'd him with Death that Moment, if he offer'd to open his Mouth: I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that we had gone too far to ſtop now; and I believe, if he had made any Reſiſtance, I ſhould certainly have diſpatch'd him. When he found Reſiſtance would ſignify nothing, he ſat him down and wept bitterly. I was really ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſee him ſo much afflicted, and comforted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0388100100:78"/>
him all I could; and, to encourage him, I told him, aſſoon as we arriv'd at <hi>Magazan,</hi> (a ſtrong Port belonging to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> upon the <hi>Afric</hi> Coaſt) where I had deſign'd to ſteer our Courſe, he ſhould not only have his Liberty, but I would reward him with fifty Piſtoles for the Pains he ſhould be at. I further added, I would not have given him this Trouble, if I could have found a poſſibility of doing without him. He ſeem'd to be ſatisfied, and promis'd us all the Help he could. I told him we would make the beſt of our way to <hi>Magazan,</hi> not being above twenty Leagues South of <hi>Sallee:</hi> He ſeem'd very much pleas'd our Voyage was to be ſo ſhort, for the Wind was fair, and we hop'd to arrive at <hi>Magazan</hi> in two Days at the fartheſt. I had provided eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that was neceſſary for a much longer Voyage, and when we had directed our Courſe, and were ſettled in our Way, I deſir'd the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take ſome Refreſhment, and compoſe her unſettled Thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we were now out of all manner of Danger. I ſaid this only to comfort her, for I was even in fear of the Captain's Ship, or ſome other <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Veſſel, meeting us by Chance; and the <hi>Italian</hi> put into my Head ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fear, that as I had declar'd I was never at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazan,</hi> nor did not know where it was ſituated, he was not aſſur'd but <hi>Muſtapha</hi> might ſteer his Courſe to ſome Place that was poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Moors.</hi> I gave <hi>Muſtapha</hi> a Hint of it, with a Promiſe of a quick Diſpatch if he betray'd us: But he aſſur'd me there was never another Port between that and <hi>Magazan.</hi> After we had refreſh'd our ſelves, I intreated the Lady to acquaint us how ſhe came into the Power of the Captain. Now we are ſomething at Eaſe, ſaid ſhe obligingly, I ſhall inform you with Pleaſure.</p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Father's Name was <hi>Villars,</hi> an eminent Merchant of the City of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> My Mother dy'd when I was very young, ſo that I could never know the Loſs of her. The Care of my Father atton'd for the Want of my Mother: He gave me all the Education that was proper to our Sex; but before I was Sixteen my Father dy'd. The Grief and Sorrow I felt for his Death, was not recompens'd by an Eſtate of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds a Year, which he left intirely at my own Diſpoſal; beſides ſeveral valuable Jewels of my Mother's. My Fortune, I ſuppoſe, brought me many Admirers; but as I was a Stranger to Love, I had no Inclination to marry: Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peſter'd ſo much with their Company and Courtſhip, I retir'd to a Country Houſe near the Sea Side; and as I did not care to ſee any of my Suitors, ſo whenever they came I always left Word I was gone abroad, or out of Order; and in a little time I got clear of their Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</p>
                        <p>I had the Misfortune to be a Woman of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, tho' young; for my Father had ſeveral
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0388100100:80"/>
Veſſels at Sea. The Captain of one of the Ships that traded to <hi>Turky</hi> brought me a Bill of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and I happen'd to pleaſe him, (tho' more than I knew till afterwards.) In ſhort, he fell deſperately in Love with me, but hearing my Averſion to Matrimony, never declar'd his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to me; yet by Bribes and Preſents gain'd over to his Intereſt a Maid that liv'd with me, who for a hundred Pound had plac'd him in a Cloſet in my Bed-chamber. I came and undreſs'd my ſelf as Uſual, and went to Reſt: But I had not been long laid ere I found a Perſon pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the Cloaths, and attempting to come to Bed to me. I was prodigiouſly ſurpriz'd and frighten'd, as any one would imagine: I call'd for Help, but no one came to my Aſſiſtance; for the Maid had taken Care of that. I got out of Bed with much ado, and attempted to open the Door, but found I was lock'd in. I us'd Intreaties to the Wretch (who was diſguis'd in ſuch a manner that I could not know him, for he had got a Mask on) but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: He ſeiz'd me, and I was ſo faint with Struggling, that he was very near accompliſhing his barbarous Deſign, when my other Cloſet Door flew open, (for I had one at each End of the Room) and there came out another Man diſguis'd. My Fear could not be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd; but I was in ſuch a Terror that I did not well know whether I was really alive.</p>
                        <p>The Perſon who came out laſt ſeiz'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on the other, who let me go to defend himſelf. I ran to the Door, and Fear adding to my Strength, I burſt it open; but how, or which way, I cannot remember. I ran to the Maid's Chamber, and the Noiſe and Confuſion we were in alarm'd the Men Servants. I had ſlipt on a Gown; and when I had got all the Men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0388100100:81"/>
I told 'em the Reaſon of this Alarm. They immediately arm'd themſelves, and ran up to my Chamber, but the Perſons were both gone. In ſearching the Room we found a Piece of a Mask on the Ground, and a Handkerchief mark'd <hi>L. K.</hi> with Stains of Blood in ſeveral Parts of the Room. We could not imagine who they were; and I was ſo very much confus'd and frighten'd, that I did not examine the Bottom of it that Night, but went to Bed in another Room very ill with the Fright; though not before I had given Order to two of my Men Servants to watch at my Chamber Door.</p>
                        <p>I ſearch'd the Cloſets of that other Room, and under the Bed, before I wou'd venture. And it being a Room where my Father us'd to lye, it had a Bar on the Inſide, ſo I and my Maid went to Bed. Notwithſtanding my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, Frights and Fears, I fell aſleep, and when I woke in the Morning, found my ſelf very well. I began then to think reaſonably of my laſt Night's Adventure, and eaſily judg'd, that one or both of my Maids muſt be in the Confederacy, for my Door never us'd to be lock'd on the Outſide before. I ſent for all my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants up, Men and Maids, and related to 'em the Night's Adventure. But they brought me Word, that Mrs. <hi>Suſan</hi> was not to be found. I ſent to examine her Room, but I was inform'd all her things were gone. We all concluded, that ſhe was the Occaſion of the laſt Night's Plot. I did not think fit to ſend after her, rejoycing I had eſcap'd ſuch a baſe Conſpiracy; till going up into my own Chamber, I found a Diamond Necklace, a Ring, my Gold Watch, and about ſixty Guineas in Money taken away; my Eſcritore broke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and a Bill of five hundred Pounds that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0388100100:82"/>
was due, taken away. I immediately ſent to <hi>Briſtol</hi> to ſtop Payment, but was told, that my Maid had come, as from me, for the Money, and had receiv'd it ſeveral Hours before. We made the ſtricteſt Search we could for her, but all to no Purpoſe. So I gave it all for loſt. Six Weeks paſs'd on, and no News concerning my Maid. One Morning as I was walking in my Garden, a Sailor brought me a Letter, which was to this Purpoſe.</p>

The Reaſon of my Repentance, and Sorrow (tho' a ſincere one) is at the Approach of Death, by the Accident of a Fall down the Hold of the Ship, where I broke my left Leg, and fractur'd my Scull, ſo that I have been ſenſeleſs for two Days. But God granting me my Senſes again (tho' with the Information that I can't live four and twenty Hours) has, through his Mercy, convino'd me, that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Pardon from him, is to reſtore what is yours, with a ſincere Confeſſion of the fatal Night's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, that corrupted my Honeſty, and will be the Cauſe of my Death.

                        <p>Now I had heard of one of the <hi>Turky</hi> Fleet, that was obliged to put into the Road by a violent Storm: And that it had a Sedan, made with Looking-glaſs, of a very curious Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, deſign'd for a Preſent to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor. I ask'd the Sailor ſeveral Queſtions concerning the Letter, and he anſwer'd me bluntly, he could not tell any thing about it; but that there was a young Woman, who had fell down their Hold, and had almoſt kill'd her ſelf; and that they did not expect ſhe could ever recover. I reſolv'd to go along with him, but to take two Men Servants and a Maid with me. I walk'd to the Water-ſide, which was about a quarter of a Mile from my Houſe, and there I found a Ship's Boat with eight Oars, and very handſome. I ſtept into it, with my Servants, without any Heſitation, and put off. In about an Hour and a half we came along ſide of the Veſſel, they mann'd Side for me, and I was handed up, and led into the Cabin, where I found my Maid upon a Pallat-Bed in one Corner of it. Aſſoon as ſhe ſaw me, ſhe attempted to riſe, but ſeem'd not to have Strength enough, and fell down again. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd ſhe would not put her ſelf to any Pain, but compoſe her Thoughts, that ſhe might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to inform me of what ſhe had promis'd me in her Letter. O! Madam, ſhe cry'd (with Heſitations, Sighs, and ready to faint every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) you do not know what I feel at the Sight of you. You bring into my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the Tranſaction of that fearful Night, but I hope your Goodneſs will forgive me. I ſhall put into your Hands what I have wickedly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0388100100:84"/>
robb'd you of; and ſince I am going out of this World, I am aſſur'd your Good-nature will prevail for my Pardon. I told her I forgave her freely, and I hop'd Heav'n would do ſo too. She thank'd me, but ſaid, ſhe found her ſelf ſo Ill, that ſhe intreated leave to reſt from ſpeaking a Minute or two, to gather a little Breath.</p>
                        <p>I waited with ſome Impatience, but ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſo long ſilent, that I really thought ſhe was expir'd. Upon that Suppoſition, I call'd to her, and ſhe anſwer'd me but faintly. Well, Madam ſaid ſhe, as I find you impatient to know what I have promis'd you, I will tell you, as well as I am able.</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi>Bourn</hi> had for many Months a great Paſſion for you, but finding you averſe to Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, he tamper'd with me, and offer'd me ſuch large Sums of Money, that beat down all my guard of Honeſty, and overcame it quite. He gave me a hundred Pounds, beſides other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Preſents, to admit him into your Cloſet, before you went to-bed, which accordingly (dazled with the luſtre of the Gold) I did. You know what follow'd, and if he had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the ſudden Appearance of another Perſon out of the other Cloſet, would have compaſs'd his Deſign. Said I (eagerly) pray do you know who the other Perſon was? Yes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, return'd the Wench, it was Mr. <hi>Lawrence Kendrick,</hi> your former Suitor and Guardian, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd there for the ſame baſe Intent by your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Woman. How! cry'd I amaz'd, are you aſſur'd of that? Madam (purſu'd ſhe) when you got out of the Door, Mr. <hi>Kendrick</hi> ſeiz'd upon Mr. <hi>Bourn,</hi> and they ſtruggled together ſome time; but Mr. <hi>Kend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rik</hi>'s Mask falling off, Captain <hi>Bourn</hi> knowing him, cry'd, Is it you! In ſhort, they ſoon came to an Ecclairciſement, and went down Stairs unperceiv'd
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0388100100:85"/>
by any of us in the Hurry. Where he declar'd to the Captain, that he had prevail'd upon Mrs. <hi>Ellis</hi> (your Woman) for a good Sum of Money, to convey him into the Cloſet, which ſhe did unperceiv'd of any. Thus, (ſaid I) may ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions be ever fruſtrated.</p>
                        <p>When ſhe had finiſh'd, ſhe begg'd me to have a little more Patience, while ſhe got a little more Strength, and ſhe would reſtore me my Money and Jewels. I was unwilling to wait long, yet thought fifteen hundred Pounds too much to loſe; for my Necklace, Ring, and Watch, were valued by my Father at a thouſand Pounds. I believe I had been full three Hours on Board, and wanted to be at Home again; and after ſhe had kept ſilent ſome time, I made bold to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb her once more. I call'd to her, and told her, I had a great Way to go, and I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of catching cold. She begg'd I would ring a Bell that hung by my Hand, which I did, and the Sailor came in that brought me the Letter. Pray, ſaid the Maid, is my Brother ready to come in? Yes, anſwer'd he, and has been on Board this half Hour. It's very well, ſaid ſhe. Upon that ſhe rais'd her Hand, and unpinn'd a Shutter, that fell down, and let Light enough into the Cabin, which was dark before; but I thought her Illneſs was the Reaſon of that. But to my eternal Amazement I ſaw her riſe from the Pallate, as well as ever I ſaw her in my Life. Before I had Power to ſpeak, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Bourn</hi> enter'd. I could not preſently dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Myſtery. I hope Captain (ſaid I, at laſt) that you repent of your raſh and bold Attempt. Yes Madam, (anſwer'd he) that I did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in't, but I hope I have it now in my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to finiſh my Deſign. I askt him what he meant. He told me I ſhould ſoon be inform'd,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0388100100:86"/>
and if I would not conſent to his Embraces, he would certainly raviſh me that very Night. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Treatment, I began to call for my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; but the faithleſs <hi>Suſan</hi> told me they were taken care of, and ſafe a-ſhore. Yes Madam, return'd the Captain, they are twelve Miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us by this Time; and deſir'd I would look out of the Cabin Window, which they had juſt before open'd. I caſt my Eyes behind me; and too ſoon perceiv'd that we were a conſiderable Diſtance from the Land. I did not look long, for the Sight took away my Senſes, and I fell down in a Swoon, and when I came to my ſelf it was far in Night; but I was ſo faint and ill, that my feeble Limbs would not ſupport my Body. Grief attack'd me ſo violently, that it was thought by every body it would ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me. By next Morning a ſtrong Feaver ſeiz'd me, and all that I remember'd for ſix Weeks was, that I was put to Bed, with the Wretch that betray'd me to attend me. But the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I was in really wrought upon her, and produc'd a true Converſion. She lamented more than I; and curs'd her ſelf a thouſand times.</p>
                        <p>When I had recover'd my Senſes, I was wore away to a Skeleton. And ſure never any one in my Condition found any Relief but Death. But it pleas'd the Divine Being to work another Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and inſenſibly reſtore me to my former health of Body, but a Mind involv'd in the moſt cruel Torture paſt Imagination.</p>
                        <p>When I found the Maid's Repentance real, I freely forgave her. The Captain in all this Time had never come near me, but only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after my Health, as <hi>Suſan</hi> inform'd me. But when he perceiv'd I had regain'd my former Health and Beauty, (as he call'd it) I was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with his beaſtly Addreſſes. He told me,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0388100100:87"/>
if I would conſent to marry him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the Crime he was guilty of, he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſteer for <hi>England,</hi> which he could reach in a few Days. I conſider'd I was in a Wretch's Power, who, by what he had done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, would ſtick at nothing to gain his Ends; I therefore reſolv'd to flatter him, by the Advice of my Maid; who, notwithſtanding ſhe had brought me into theſe Diſtreſſes, I had taken into my former Favour. In one of his troubleſome Viſits, I told him, if he would immediately reſtore me to my Liberty, I would upon the Inſtant make him my Husband, when we could procure a proper Perſon to tye the Knot. He anſwer'd me, that the only way to ſecure me to him, was to have Poſſeſſion of my Body before-hand; and, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd he, if you think the Action criminal, I'll ſoon cure your Conſcience, by the Licence of the Church. For, ſaid he, if you intend what you propoſe, you will eaſily comply; and nothing elſe will convince me of your Sincerity. I'll give you one Day to conſider on't; but, (continu'd the Wretch) if you refuſe to ſubmit by fair Means, I to-morrow by Force will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy you. So I leave you to conſider on't; and ſaying this, left us in the Cabin. I had deſir'd <hi>Suſan</hi> to conceal our Reconcilement from the Captain, which ſhe artfully had done; and in his Diſcourſe, would often throw in a Word or two in his behalf.</p>
                        <p>When we were alone, I gave my ſelf over to my Sorrows, and thought of nothing for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hours but my unhappy Circumſtances. We both continu'd ſilent, a conſiderable time. Nor indeed had I Power to ſpeak, tho' Heav'n had indu'd me with that Fortitude, that I had reſolv'd ſooner to die, than to ſubmit to his curs'd Propoſals. I told <hi>Suſan,</hi> that I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0388100100:88"/>
to put an end to all my Sorrows by Death; and when that fatal Hour arriv'd of his limitted Time, I would plung a Knife, I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd for that Deſign, into my Boſom. This Reſolution once more renew'd our Griefs, and we mingled Tears together. We wept ſo much, that the Fountains of our Eyes were dry, and we again remain'd ſilent. At laſt <hi>Suſan</hi> broke it, with a Speech to this Purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Madam, in the Confuſion of my Thoughts, I have choſe out one that has ſome Probability of Succeſs; but it will at leaſt convince you of my Repentance, and the Deſire I have to reſtore you that Peace I have barbarouſly broke. The Captain yet thinks me in his Intereſt, and if we can contrive it, I'll ſubmit to his loath'd Embraces in your Room, which ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd in this Manner. (You ſhall treat with him upon't to-morrow Morning) The Articles ſhall be theſe; Firſt, that he come in the Dark, and ſtay no longer than one Hour with you; and laſt, that he ſhall not repeat your Familiarity, till you are join'd by the Prieſt.</p>
                        <p>I muſt confeſs, this Propoſal gave me a dawn of Hope; and if we could but ſucceed in't, I ſhould not fear his farther Paſſion, when we were landed. For I knew it was eaſy to find Protection, when once on Shore in <hi>England,</hi> and I thought the Contrivance feazible enough; for we were much of the ſame Age, and no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Difference in our Make, at leaſt in the Dark.</p>
                        <p>She left it to me to manage: And I reſolv'd to put on a more compos'd Countenance at the Captain's next Viſit, which was ſoon after, tho' he had given me longer Time to conſider. When he came in, he begg'd my Pardon for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting me, but he came to make me a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0388100100:89"/>
he ſaid, and put a little Box in my Hand, deſiring I would open it, which I did, where I found my Jewels and Money. I reſtore you that, Madam, (continu'd he) and would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be oblig'd to you for any thing but your Perſon; and even all your Fortune ſhall be at your own Diſpoſal, and the Moment you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to my Deſires, I'll deliver you a Paper that ſhall oblige me to ſign whatever Terms you ſhall think fit to make me. I paus'd a ſhort time, but indeed it was to think what my Tongue ſhould utter ſo foreign to my Heart.</p>
                        <p>Captain, ſaid I, you take the only Way to gain your Point; and I muſt confeſs, this Shew of Generoſity (tho' it's in your Power to force 'em from me again) ſeems a little to leſſen the ill Opinion I have Reaſon to bear againſt you: If you'll pleaſe to allow me one half Hour to think a little, I'll give you my final Anſwer to-night. He ſeem'd very much overjoy'd at my Diſcourſe, and ſhew'd it in an extravagant unpolite manner, thank'd me, and went out.</p>
                        <p>I did not want that time to prepare what I had to ſay, but I thought it was better than to come into it on a ſudden. The time expir'd, the Captain came in with an expecting Face. I bad him ſit down, which I found by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance he took as a good Prologue. Sir, ſaid I, I have fully conſidered every thing, and if you will comply with a few Articles, you ſhall have Poſſeſſion of what you deſire to-night. Articles; Madam! I'll ſign to a Blank (reply'd the Brute) if you pleaſe. I told him they were only verbal ones: Firſt, ſaid I, I'll have no Light in the Room; ſecondly, you ſhall ſtay with me but an Hour; and laſtly, never to expect any more Favours till we are lawfully marry'd. Madam, return'd the Captain, you ſo overjoy me that I don't know
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0388100100:90"/>
where I am: I'll comply with all your Articles, and you have made me the happieſt of Mankind. He ſaid a great deal more fulſome Stuff, that was as nauſeous to my Ears as a Plague-ſore to the Sight. He left us, with a Hope I would not long defer his Happineſs. It was well I was in a dark Corner of the Cabin; for had I been in the Light, he would have perceiv'd the Confuſion in my Countenance.</p>
                        <p>The hated Hour drew near, and <hi>Suſan</hi> with a ſincere Grief, and Tears running down her Cheeks, laid her ſelf in the Captain's loathed Bed. I was really griev'd at the Sacrifice ſhe was going to make me, for I was convinc'd ſhe had no looſe Deſires about her. The Captain enter'd in the Dark, and was as happy as a falſe Imagination could make him. I muſt confeſs, I was in a thouſand Frights and Fears leſt the Girl ſhould have been diſcovered; but every thing ſucceeded too well, and the Captain roſe within his limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, and went out.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as he was gone, the poor Creature got up from her guilty Scene. Well, Madam, (ſaid ſhe, all drown'd in Tears,) I hope I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd you (tho' to my eternal Coſt) of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Sincerity; but I hope Heaven will pardon me, and not lay the Crime to me or you, when fatal Neceſſity was the only Cauſe. I gave her all the Comfort I was capable of, and told her I did not think it impoſſible to oblige him to marry her, when we had him in our Power on Shore, and that Formality would obliterate all melancholy Thoughts. How! (reply'd <hi>Suſan)</hi> No Madam! tho' I have done all this, yet it was only to ſerve you; and before I would be his Wife, (or indeed any Man's Wife) I would ſubmit to the moſt ſervile Offices of Life to ſupport it: And if the Captain knew how we
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0388100100:91"/>
had deceiv'd him, and would offer to marry me to attone for his Fault, I could not conſent, for I loath the very Thoughts of him. Well then, <hi>Suſan,</hi> ſaid I, when we have overcome all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and worn off the Remembrance of our Sufferings, I will ſettle a Competency for Life, that ſhall put thee above all Fear of Want. Madam, reply'd <hi>Suſan,</hi> that's all I ſhall deſire; and then I'll go to ſome Corner of the World, live retir'd, and repent of all my paſt Crimes and Follies. I told her ſhe needed not do that, ſhe might, notwithſtanding what was paſt, live with me. No, Madam, that can never be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd <hi>Suſan;</hi> for you muſt of neceſſity, to clear your own Reputation, divulge the Secret, and then with what Confidence ſhall I be able to look upon any one? I told her, it would be eſteem'd as an Action wholly virtuous, without one Spot or Blemiſh. All I was capable of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not alter her Reſolution; but ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in retiring from the World, and living re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe, and I deſiſted from ſpeaking any more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject.</p>
                        <p>It had been much happier for us both, if we had never enter'd upon the Argument; for we had not remain'd ſilent a Moment, before the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain enter'd, with a Light in his Hand, and the utmoſt Fury in his Countenance. Thou Devil! ſaid he to <hi>Suſan,</hi> and haſt thou betray'd me, Wretch! after what I have done for thee? but I ſhall ſtudy ſome way to have ample Vengeance on thee: And for you, Madam, I ſhall give you ſtill the ſame Terms and Time I firſt propos'd; but that paſt, expect not the leaſt Hope, for I will enjoy you, tho' the Moment after Death ſhould ſeize me. When he had done ſpeaking, he went out: But it was a conſiderable time ere we came out of our Surprize.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0388100100:92"/>
We were convinc'd that he had liſten'd and overheard all our Diſcourſe, though we ſpoke but ſoftly; and we fear'd to utter our Thoughts to one another, as imagining he would overhear us ſtill. But <hi>Suſan</hi> at laſt broke out in theſe Words; Good Heav'n! I hope the Puniſhments I am bound to ſuffer will atone for all my Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences! If it will make my Peace with Thee, I'll undergo all the Torments in the World in that bleſt Hope! I had not Words to comfort her, for the thoughts of my own Condition ty'd up my Tongue; but the Pain of Thinking, nothing could exceed. I pray'd to God to bring me out of this Misfortune, or give me Force of Reaſon to ſuffer with Patience a Diſſolution from this World. When <hi>Suſan</hi> heard me, ſhe told me, ſhe could ſee no Path to lead us thro' this Labyrinth of Misfortunes, but through the Gate of Death; and, added ſhe, ſince we muſt die once, the ſooner we leave this troubleſome World, the ſooner we ſhall find Reſt.</p>
                        <p>Death ſtill bore to me a froſty Sound, however I ſoon reſolv'd upon't; but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it was what moſt confounded me: At laſt we both thought of Drowning, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, whenever the Captain came to accompliſh his wicked Intent, to throw our ſelves out of the Cabin Window. Will you ſo? ſaid the Captain, (who had overheard us again, for Grief had taken all Caution from us) but I'll ſoon prevent that. He immediately took Hammer and Nails, and nail'd the Shutters ſo cloſe that it was not in our weak Strength to undo them. After he was gone, we ſpent the Night in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and juſt before the Morning dawn'd, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the rocking of the Ship, the Noiſe of the Sailors, and the Loudneſs of the Wind, that we were in a prodigious Storm. This gave
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0388100100:93"/>
us Hopes that the Ship would be caſt away, and that God had heard our Prayers, and would not let us lay violent Hands upon our ſelves. Nay, deceiving Hope was ready to enter our Thoughts, that we might be caſt away upon ſome Shore, and receive Aſſiſtance when we leaſt expected it. The Storm laſted the whole Day and part of the next Night; but as it ſenſibly abated, ſo our Fears increas'd. The Captain gave us another Viſit: Well, ſaid he, Madam, I hope you have had ſufficient time to conſider of my Propoſals, and I am now come for my final Anſwer. Said I, Heav'n has given you an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by raiſing the Storm; and if you have the leaſt Notion of a Divinity, you'll find 'twas his Voice that ſpok to you in that Tempeſt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from ſuch a baſe Attempt. Nay, Madam, if you imagine you can preach me from my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, preach on a God's Name. Wretch that thou art! ſaid I, how canſt thou mention that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Name, and yet have ſuch Thoughts as He abhors? I fancy, Madam, return'd the Brute, your Ladyſhip feels the Influence of the Moon, and for fear I ſhould catch the Infection, I'll leave you for a while; but with a Word by the by, If you don't conſent the next time I come, by Hell! (ſince you will not let me mention Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) I'll not only raviſh you, but every Sailor in the Ship ſhall do ſo too, if they think fit; and I believe they are ſharp enough ſett to fall too upon worſe Food than I ſhall ſet before them.</p>
                        <p>He ſaid a great many more groſs things, that would only become his Mouth to utter: And to convince you, Madam, that I will do what I ſay, ſaid he, I ſhall begin with Mrs. <hi>Suſan:</hi> Come Miſtreſs, ſaid he to her, now I have had the firſt Cut of you, I'll let my Sailors go to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0388100100:94"/>
Dinner. With this he forc'd us both on the Quarter Deck, and call'd all the Seamen about him: Here my Lads, ſaid he, I have but two dainty Bits, and I'll give you one among you, that you mayn't think I am over greedy. The Sailors ſtar'd upon one another, and did not well know what he meant, till he told them in Terms plain enough, with Promiſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to him that would prove the greateſt Rogue. <hi>Suſan</hi> fell upon her Knees, and intreated them not to take Pattern from their barbarous Captain, but to pity a poor unfortunate Woman, reduc'd to the fatal Neceſſity of living no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Some of the Sailors made Sport with her Miſery, while others began to pity her. One blunt Fellow cry'd, Damn it! I love a Woman well enough, but don't care to have her forc'd upon me: It's like eating againſt one's Stomach. Beſide, ſaid another, I ſuppoſe there's ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Captain's Liberality, or he would not part with her. I obſerv'd one of them that ſtood at ſome Diſtance, taking Notice of what was done, without ſeeming pleas'd. I thought I knew his Face too, and he appear'd above a common Sailor by his Looks and Cleanlineſs. I had not till now appear'd publickly. I was determin'd to ſpeak to him, and to crave his Aſſiſtance. Aſſoon as he ſaw me, he ſeem'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd, and cry'd, Bleſs me, Madam! how came you here? I told him I was betray'd by the Captain. I was inform'd, ſaid he, that he had two Ladies, Paſſengers for <hi>Zant,</hi> but I little thought you were one of them, for I was not on Board till an Hour after you arriv'd. I begg'd he would take me under his Protection; which he ſwore with a great Oath he would, or the Captain ſhould cut his Throat. Madam, added he, I am Mate of this Veſſel, put in by your
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0388100100:95"/>
honourable Father; and had been Captain, if it had not been for the Tricks of that Raſcal; (pointing to the Captain.)</p>
                        <p>The Sailors were ſo divided between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they had not proceeded to any Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence with <hi>Suſan;</hi> and ſhe remain'd leaning upon the Side of the Ship, all drown'd in Tears. The Captain had all this time been laughing at the Diſputes of the Sailors; but perceiving the Mate in Conference with me, came up to him, and with a faucy Tone, ask'd him what Buſineſs he had with me. I have no other Buſineſs, anſwer'd the Mate, but to protect her from your ill Uſage. You impertinent Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, cry'd the Captain, I'll teach you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with my Affairs; and upon ſaying this, he lifted up his Hand and ſtruck him: But the Mate ſoon return'd his Blow with Intereſt, and knock'd him down upon the Deck. The Sailors came and parted 'em; but the Captain ſwore that Blow ſhould coſt him his Life. He upon the Inſtant ran into the Cabin for ſome Inſtrument to diſpatch him, as was ſuppos'd; but the Mate follow'd him cloſe, and, knowing his violent Temper, barr'd the Door of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, ſo that the Captain remain'd a Priſoner.</p>
                        <p>The Mate took from his own Cabin, which was near the Captain's, a Cutlaſs, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the Door, and ſwore he would be the Death of him that firſt attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him; and bad none of them offer to ſtir, till they had heard what he had to ſay.</p>
                        <p>The Sailors had caſt off all Thoughts from <hi>Suſan,</hi> to hear what the Mate could ſay; who declar'd who I was, and by what Means I was betray'd on Board. When the Sailors found I was their Miſtreſs, and Owner of the Ship, they ſoon began to repent of what they were
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0388100100:96"/>
going about, and declar'd they would ſerve me with their Lives. When I found I had gain'd moſt of 'em on my Side, I told 'em my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at length, only concealing <hi>Suſan</hi>'s Affair with the Captain; and they ſeem'd all prodigiouſly amaz'd, and ſtood gaping upon me like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Statues.</p>
                        <p>The Captain in the Cabin was all this time ſwearing, curſing, and making a Noiſe at his Reſtraint. I told the Mate, if he thought fit, we would releaſe him. Yes Madam, if you pleaſe, ſaid he, out of the Great Cabin, but we muſt confine him ſomewhere elſe; well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his turbulent Spirit would never be eaſy. I told him I would be guided by him, and if he pleaſed to accept of the Command of the Veſſel (if it was in my Power to give it him) it was at his Service. He return'd me a great many Thanks, and told me he would be very faithful in his Commiſſion. We releas'd the Captain out of the Cabin, but as ſoon as he came upon the Deck, he was ſeiz'd, with a great deal of Difficulty, Iron'd, and confin'd to another Cabin. He rag'd like a Madman at this Treatment, but all to no Purpoſe. I told him he ſhould want nothing but his Liberty, neither would I proſecute him, as his Crimes deſerv'd, when we arriv'd in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I deſir'd the Mate to make for <hi>Briſtol</hi> with all the Expedition imaginable; with a Promiſe that I would recompenſe every common Sailor with double the Wages they expected for their Voyage. They all huzza'd at the News, and one and all promis'd to ſerve me with their Lives. The Mate told me the Wind was againſt us in our Courſe, but that he would ply it to Windward (as they call it) in Expectation of its Changing. I ask'd him whereabouts we were,

and he told me, very near the Streights of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar,</hi> and ſhould have been at <hi>Zant</hi> by that time, but that they were hindred by contrary Winds, and drove back by the late Storm.

                        <p>The Captain of the Rover was the ſame we have now made our Eſcape from. He never would tell me what became of <hi>Suſan</hi> and the Crew. Madam, ſaid <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> I can inform you: They and all the Crew were ranſom'd for a thouſand Pound, and their Ship given them again. They did their Endeavour to ranſom you, but to no Purpoſe, for they could never learn what was become of you.</p>

            <p>Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi> thus ended her Relation; only added, that the Captain fell deſperately in Love with her, and would never hear of her Ranſom; tho' he treated her with Decency, allowing her every thing but Liberty; with the conveniency of a Study of Books, which the Captain had procur'd by his Piracy; and ever left in her Cloſet, her Jewels, and other things of Value, that he had taken out of the Ship.</p>

WHEN Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi> had finiſh'd her Story, I return'd her Thanks for the Trouble I had given her. Sir, return'd ſhe, Thanks will not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe me for the Pains I have taken. I ſhall demand the ſame Satisfaction from you. I told her I ſhould readily obey her Commands; but I begg'd leave to give her the Relation in <hi>French,</hi> that our <hi>Italian</hi> might partake; for I deſign, with your leave, to inſiſt of the ſame from him. Sir, reply'd the Lady, I would have related my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Story in that Language, if you had given me the leaſt Hint. But however, I'll go once more over again, if you pleaſe, in <hi>French;</hi> at leaſt the chief Circumſtances, that we may more ingage the Perſon to declare, how he has ſhar'd the ſame Fate with us. I begg'd ſhe wou'd give me leave to take that Trouble, if it were only to let her ſee, I had imprinted in my Memory what concern'd her ſo ſtrongly, that I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat every Circumſtance. She gave me leave to proceed, on which I told her Story over again in <hi>French,</hi> to the <hi>Italian.</hi> When I had finiſh'd, ſhe gave me Thanks, for the Pains I had taken. Tho' I had not been ſo long in the Relation, yet I made up the Time in deſcanting upon her Danger, and hard Fate. That a Lady of her Birth, Beauty, and Eſtate, ſhould be ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by Fortune, as to be reduc'd to wretched Slavery.</p>
            <p>I then began my own Story, from my Birth, to our preſent State. Tho' in what related to my Paſſion for the Lady, I did not directly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; yet I gave her Hints enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſhe was the Idol of my Soul, and (tho' Love like Hope does oft deceive us) I thought my obſcure Declaration did not diſpleaſe her.</p>

My Father had a plentiful Fortune, but before his Death he had much weaken'd it, in giving Dowries to my two Siſters, who were both marry'd far above their Fortunes, tho' not equal to their Birth. But Riches now ballance every Thing, and weigh down Birth and humble Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and he that has moſt Gold, is the greateſt Man.</p>

We loſt our Mother in our early Days; and my Father follow'd, before I was ten Years old, having ſettled all his Eſtate on his eldeſt Son to keep up the Grandeur of the Name, and left three Brothers of us to depend on him.</p>
                        <p>My Father in his Life-time gave us an Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſuitable to our Birth and Family; and my Brother, to give him his Due, compleated us. Two of my Brothers he procur'd Poſts in the Army for, who both loſt their Lives in one glorious Campaign. The other dyed young.</p>
                        <p>It was imagin'd by every body that had the Privilege to think for me, that their Deaths would be of no ſmall Advantage to me; and it had for ſome Years the Appearance of it. My Brother had attain'd to his thirtieth Year, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out once ever thinking of Marriage. But an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Match being propos'd, it was thought convenient for him to purſue it. The Lady that was deſign'd for him he had never ſeen; but he was inform'd ſhe was young, rich, and beautiful. He was brought to the Sight of her, and fell violently in Love with her at the firſt Viſit, and his Paſſion encreas'd every Moment. The Day was fixt for their Nuptials by the Father of the Lady, which was to be the <hi>Eaſter</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. I had attain'd to my eighteenth Year, and no Proviſion made for me; and it was thought that this Match would not bring me the leaſt Advantage.</p>
                        <p>One Day my Brother told me, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd me the Poſt of Captain of the Pope's Guards; and tho' it was far beneath my Birth, yet I was pleas'd with it, that I might have the Means to ſubſiſt, without being ſubject to the Caprice of Fortune, and the Dependance of a Brother of an uncertain Temper. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having ſome urgent Affairs, that call'd him
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0388100100:101"/>
haſtily out of Town, he gave me a Letter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to his Miſtreſs, which was to excuſe his ſudden Departure.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as he was gone, I went to execute his Commiſſion; and being known to be the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the intended Husband, had the Liberty of preſenting the Letter to the Lady's own Hands. But what Misfortunes did that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view coſt me! I no ſooner ſaw her, but I loſt my Heart, and the Regard I ow'd my Brother was of no Force againſt her Charms. I obſerv'd ſhe perus'd the Letter with Indifferency, which did not diſpleaſe me. Yet I ſo far overcame my growing Paſſion, as to add ſomething to the Excuſe my Brother had wrote. I obſerv'd, in our Converſation, that the propos'd Alliance was not very pleaſing to her; and ſhe at laſt frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told me, Duty, more than Inclination, would make her comply with it. I told her, were my Brother's Condition mine, and I had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her Sentiments, I ſhould not have the Fortitude to ſupport my ill Fortune; yet ſhould have ſo much Regard to her, whatever were my Troubles, not to be oblig'd to Duty, but Inclination.</p>
                        <p>She told me, with a riſing Bluſh, thoſe Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals never proſper'd, where the Hand could not beſtow the Heart. I agreed with her Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but added, I fear'd her Heart was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given, where ſhe could not beſtow her Hand.</p>
                        <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, I have ever been a Friend to Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing, and Truth appears ſo amiable to me, that I neither will, nor can deny it to you. O happy Man, cry'd I, who-e'er thou art! Fortune has ſhed her happieſt Influence on thee, and it is not in her Power to make thee miſerable, when bleſt with ſo much conſenting Beauty.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0388100100:102"/>
Sir, return'd the Lady, the Perſon you eſteem ſo happy, is ignorant of my Inclinations for him, and Fear will make me conceal the Secret. And the chief Reaſon why I diſcloſe it to you, is, that you would inform your Brother; for (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe, with Tears) if I am forc'd to wed him, I ſhall be for ever miſerable. Her Grief touch'd me to the Heart, and ſhe obſerv'd the Sorrow in my Face. I perceive, ſaid ſhe, the Love you bear your Brother affects your Breaſt. Madam, ſaid I, ſince you have made me this frank De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, I alſo will be free, and utter all my Heart. The Grief you ſee riſing in my Face, is owing to the Torments of my Soul. The very Moment I beheld your Charms, Love ſhot me with his ſharpeſt pointed Dart, and all the Hope I have is cold Deſpair. She obſerv'd my Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with a great deal of Satisfaction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſilent ſome time, viewing me ſtedfaſtly: Upon which I caſt my Eyes upon the Ground. Sir, ſaid ſhe (with an unconfirm'd Voice) I hope you are ſincere in what you ſay, for the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it will draw another Secret from me, which is this; The Reaſon why I cannot love your Brother is, that I have long ſince given my Heart to—you: The firſt time I ſaw your Face, it left its peaceful manſion of Repoſe, and fled for Shelter to a Stranger's Breaſt. The Joy I felt at this free Declaration ſo tranſported me, that I knew not whether I dreamt or no; but being convinc'd of the Reality, I threw my ſelf at her Feet, and uttered all my Tongue could expreſs, ſlowing from a ſincere Heart. She told me ſhe had reſolv'd on Death, before ſhe would conſent to wed my Brother: And inform'd me alſo, that her Paſſion had been increaſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of two Years. The firſt time ſhe ſaw me, was taking my leave of my Brothers, when
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0388100100:103"/>
they were going to that Campaign, from which they never return'd. In ſhort, we were as much in Love, as ever any two were.</p>
                        <p>We agreed to meet the next Day, at the ſame Place, where I had the Liberty of coming, as her Brother-in-Law that was to be.</p>
                        <p>I was Impatient for the next Day, imagining Time to have no Wings. But the happy Moment came at laſt. We talk'd of nothing for ſeveral Hours, but our mutual Love; at laſt we fell on the ungrateful Subject of the approaching Nuptials, and how we ſhould prevent 'em. I propos'd to her, running away, and tying our ſelves faſt by the ſacred Bond of Wedlock. Though, ſaid ſhe, I will never be any one's but yours, yet we muſt conſider of Futurity: I know your Fortune is but ſmall, and mine, tho' a large one, depends upon my Father: I'll find ſome Means to defer the Marriage; you may do your Endeavour to diſſwade your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for I fancy Fortune more than Beauty has gain'd his Heart. I aſſur'd her to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that he was very much in Love with her. We both wiſh'd it had been otherways, but reſolv'd to love on. We parted, tho' we had not reſolv'd on any thing, and appointed to meet the next Day, in a private Corner of the Town, at an Acquaintance of mine, that I could confide in; tho' I would not truſt him with the Secret, well knowing a Matter of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance inſlaves the Perſon that diſcloſes it. I told him I had an Intrigue with a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that I muſt be obliged to carry on at his Houſe; which he conſented to very willingly. We met according to our Appointment, but an Hour before the time prefixt, not willing one ſhould be before the other. She came alone too, for ſhe would not truſt any of her Servants. We
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0388100100:104"/>
met there every Day; and one time above the reſt, Love being pregnant in both our Eyes, I took the happy Opportunity, and was bleſs'd in the Poſſeſſion of all I wiſh'd on Earth: But Enjoyment was ſo far from palling my Deſires, that it rather encreas'd 'em. We liv'd in all the Delight of Love for a Month, but then came the Bitter to all our Sweets. My Brother arriv'd, and the fatal Day appointed for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage aproach'd. We had given our ſelves up ſo intirely to Love, that we did not think of what was to come; or if the intruding Thought did creep in, we would immediately lull it to Reſt like a froward Child.</p>
                        <p>When we parted, it was with ſuch a Regret and Sorrow, that foreboded our ill Fortune. The Father of my Miſtreſs had order'd every thing for the Nuptial Solemnity, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Magnificence; but two Days before it was to be ſolemniz'd, it was reported all over <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>Don Antonio Grimaldi</hi>'s only Daughter (who was my Miſtreſs) was taken dangerouſly ill. I was not diſpleas'd at the Rumour, as gueſſing her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. My Brother was never from her, and I was pretty well aſſur'd the Sight of him gave her a great deal of Pain. One Day finding my Brother very melancholy, I ask'd him if it was the Indiſpoſition of <hi>Grimaldi</hi>'s Daughter that occaſion'd the Gloom I obſerved in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. He reply'd ſhe was the Cauſe of what he felt: He farther added, that he thought her Sickneſs counterfeit, only to avoid him; and that he had many Reaſons to believe ſhe had given her Heart to another. I us'd many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments with him to leave her, and that ſhe was not worth his farther Thought. But he aſſur'd me it was not in his Power to hate her. I began to reflect with Reaſon on the Conduct
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0388100100:105"/>
of my Love, and found I had involv'd my ſelf in a very dangerous and troubleſome Affair: But notwithſtanding all my Reaſonings, I found my ſelf more and more in Love; and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which cures a light Paſſion, added Strength to mine; for I had not ſeen her in fifteen Days. I was reſolved at laſt to viſit her, and took the Opportunity when my Brother was with the <hi>Pope</hi> in his Cloſet. I found it no Difficulty to gain Admittance, knowing who I was: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all my Endeavours, could not get an Opportunity of ſpeaking to her, there being a great many Viſitants. I took an Occaſion of feeling her Pulſe, and we had the Happineſs of moulding our Hands for a Moment. I durſt not ſtay long, for fear my Brother ſhould come while I was there; and yet I had reſolv'd to inform him of my Viſit, which I did the firſt time of our Meeting; but added, that it was Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and to oblige him, that I gave my ſelf that Trouble. He thank'd me, and ask'd me what I thought of her Indiſpoſition. I told him I could not anſwer for the State of her Heart, but I was aſſur'd that her Body was in a violent Fever. This I ſaid, a little to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; for ſince he could not be perſuaded to abandon her, I thought it would be more to our Advantage to make him believe it was a real Indiſpoſition. He went to make her a Viſit that Evening, and at his Return told me I had given him true Information, for the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians had order'd her to be let Blood, and that ſhe was in a dangerous Fever, and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign'd to ſend her into the Country the next Day. I was mightily pleas'd that he was deceiv'd as well as the Father, and I did not doubt but ſhe had perſuaded the Phyſicians to favour the Deceit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0388100100:106"/>
Accordingly the next Day ſhe was convey'd in a Litter, to a Country Houſe of her Father's, two Leagues from <hi>Rome</hi> upon the River <hi>Tyber.</hi> I flatter'd my ſelf, that her being in the Country would give me a fairer Opportunity of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with her: But though I try'd all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods imaginable, I could not find the leaſt Glimpſe of Hope in above ſix Weeks time. I was perfectly like a mad Creature, and all my Friends (particularly my Brother) took Notice of my Uneaſineſs. But I kept the Cauſe of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to my ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Any one that's a Judge of Love, and has ever been in my Circumſtances, may gueſs at what I felt. All I cou'd learn of my Miſtreſs was, that ſhe continu'd very ill. My Mind was tortur'd with a thouſand Imaginations: Sometimes I thought her falſe, and that it was her own Deſire which kept me from ſeeing her; at other times I fancy'd ſhe was really indiſpos'd.</p>
                        <p>A Month more ſlip'd away, and I was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to ſee her then as at firſt. One Morning my Brother came into my Chamber, before I was dreſt. He ſeem'd over-complaiſant to me, and expreſs'd a Concern for the Alteration of my Temper. I fancy (ſaid he) Brother, that Love has forc'd himſelf into your Breaſt; and that the Object of your Paſſion has no Regard to the Torments you endure. I excus'd my ſelf to him, that Love had no concern in my Humour, but rather an inward Indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Body. He ſaid many kind things upon that Occaſion, promis'd to aſſiſt me all he could, and left me.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as he was gone, I dreſs'd my ſelf, and got on Horſeback, in order once more to try my Fortune; and I had taken a Reſolution to ſee my Miſtreſs, whatever Hazard I ſhould run.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0388100100:107"/>
When I came upon the skirt of a Wood, within half a League of the Place where I was going, I was ſurrounded by a dozen Men on Horſeback, who (notwithſtanding the Reſiſtance I made) got me down, bound me, and carry'd me into the Wood. I imagin'd 'em to be Thieves, by their Proceeding; but they never once attempted to take any thing from me, which alter'd my Opinion, and I began to think they had a Deſign upon my Life.</p>
                        <p>The State and Uncertainty of my Love made Death look like a Friend.</p>
                        <p>They kept me in the Wood till the Dusk of the Evening, then clapt me into a Litter, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd hard all Night. The next Morning I was put into a Boat, and hurry'd on board a Veſſel that lay a League off at Sea. Aſſoon as they had receiv'd me, they weighted and ſet Sail; and the Perſon that ſeem'd to have Command in the Boat, prov'd to be the Captain of the Veſſel.</p>
                        <p>They carry'd me bound into his Cabin. When we were alone, he gave me a Paper, which I ſoon knew to be my Brother's Hand-writing; and in it an open Letter, whoſe Hand I could not tell by the Direction. Upon this the <hi>Italian</hi> took 'em both out of his Boſom. See, ſaid he, the fatal Scroll, which has robb'd me of all Joy in this Life, and which I have kept during my Captivity.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Letter he read was to this Effect.</p>

Sir, tho' I am well paid by your Brother, to end your Life, yet I have ſo much Compaſſion for your Sufferings, (knowing your Crime to be only Love) to mitigate your Sentence, I'll put you into a Boat, with two Men to conduct you, and every thing that ſhall be neceſſary: Upon this Condition, that you will give me your Word and Honour, not to appear at <hi>Rome</hi> in forty Days.</p>
                        <p>I thank'd him for his Kindneſs, gave him my Word, and told him it was not in fear of Death, but only to diſappoint my barbarous Brother. Immediately a Boat was hoiſted out, and every thing that was needful for a Month's Voyage. My two Men were paid for the Voyage before-hand, and we left the Ship. I I order'd 'em to ſteer for <hi>Leghorn,</hi> becauſe there I could be furniſh'd with every thing that I wanted, from my Siſter, who had reſided there two Years with her Husband, a Nobleman of <hi>Florence.</hi> But the Wind not proving favourable, we were drove out of our intended Courſe, and had it not been for a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel, bound for <hi>Malta,</hi> who took us up, we had certainly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd. And happy for me, had it been my Fate to have had a Wave for my Winding-ſheet; for two Days after we were received on Board, a Corſair of <hi>Barbary</hi> met with us, and took us all Priſoners.</p>
                        <p>I made no extraordinary Appearance, being I was always diſguis'd when I went to the Houſe where my Miſtreſs lay indiſpos'd. <hi>Hamet</hi>
                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0388100100:110"/>
(the Name of our <hi>Iriſh</hi> Renagado) valu'd my Ranſom but at two hundred Pounds. I wrote to both my Siſters ſeveral times, and laid before 'em my unhappy Condition, but never could hear from 'em. So that I either fear'd my Letters had miſcarry'd, or they were willing to forget an unhappy Wretch like my Self. Tho', to ſay Truth, I never receiv'd any hard Uſage from <hi>Hamet;</hi> therefore if the Divine Being will favour us in our Eſcape, I'll faithfully ſend him my Ranſom.</p>

            <p>WHEN he had ended his Story, we condol'd with one another, for our Misfortues had a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance. By this time the Day began to dawn, and <hi>Muſtapha</hi> told us we ſhould reach <hi>Magazan</hi> before Night. We were all mightily overjoy'd, becauſe we expected to be a Day longer in our Voyage. I begg'd the Favour of Mrs. <hi>Villars,</hi> to let me cleanſe her Face from the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre; which ſhe conſented to. I was fill'd with Contemplation of her Beauty, but was rous'd from thoſe pleaſing Thoughts, by the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſeveral lowring Clouds that ſeem'd to threaten us with a Hurrican, frequent in thoſe Parts; and tho' they ſeldom laſt long, yet they might prove dangerous to our ſmall Veſſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muſtapha</hi> advis'd to make to Shore, but I could by no Perſuaſion agree to that, but ordered him to hold on his Courſe for <hi>Magazan.</hi> But the Tempeſt roſe ſo ſuddenly, and ſo violent, that we were oblig'd to leave our ſelves to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Waves; and we did not know which way we drove, for the dark Clouds had almoſt form'd another Night.</p>
            <p>Our Boat was a new ſtout Boat, and bore the Weather very well, but it frighten'd Mrs. <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> very much; and I had no other Regard but for her. The Tempeſt continu'd for near half
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0388100100:111"/>
the Day, and when it grew Calm, and clear'd up, we were not in Sight of Land. By good Fortune I had provided a Compaſs; and I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Muſtapha</hi> to ſteer due South, the ſame Courſe we kept before the Storm began, which was before the Wind. But tho' we had ſail'd ſeveral Hours South, we could not diſcover any Land. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> advis'd us to put to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward back, for he did not douht but we had over-ſhot <hi>Magazan</hi> in the Storm.</p>
            <p>We were preparing to tack about, when we diſcover'd a Sail, within half a League of us; for it was hazy Weather, notwithſtanding the Storm was over, or we ſhould have perceiv'd her time enough to have avoided her. We kept upon a Wind, and it freſhning upon us, our Sail ſplit, and we found it was impoſſible to avoid the Ship, who gain'd upon us every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We thought it our wiſeſt Courſe to lye by, and wait for her. Now all the Hope we had was, that the Veſſel would prove a Ship of <hi>Europe.</hi> I deſir'd Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi> to conceal her Sex, and begg'd the Favour of the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> to keep the Secret. The Ship was near us, and to our ſurprizing Joy, hoiſted <hi>French</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. We immediately put on Board, becauſe they lay by on purpoſe.</p>
            <p>We were ſoon inform'd Monſieur <hi>Pidau de St. Olon</hi> was on Board, the Ambaſſador from the King of <hi>France</hi> to the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi> to treat of Peace between the two Crowns. I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately begg'd to be brought to the Ambaſſador's Preſence, who receiv'd us very kindly. I told him all our Stories, but conceal'd that of Mrs. <hi>Villars,</hi> for fear of any Accident. He us'd us very civilly, and promis'd us his Protection. He ſaid his Affair would not detain him long, and he would be ſure to gain ſafe Conduct for us into our own Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0388100100:112"/>
I return'd him Thanks for his generous Prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and begg'd he would command my Life, to ſee how readily I would obey him. He told me, ſince I was willing to oblige him, he would ſoon put it in my Power to ſerve him.</p>
            <p>I have, ſaid he, loſt three of my Retinue in the Voyage, two by Sickneſs, and one drown'd by Accident. You'll juſt make up that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and you need not take any Care for Habits; I will provide for you. The fourth Perſon in your Company I believe you'll be ſatisfy'd ſhould be taken Care of on Board our Ship, for his Landing on the <hi>African</hi> Coaſt may prove prejudicial to your Affairs. I was mightily pleas'd with his Propoſals, and communicated it to Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi> and our <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman. Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi> told me, ſhe was intirely under my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the <hi>Italian</hi> thought he ſhould have a better Opportunity of getting into his own Country from <hi>Mequinez,</hi> than <hi>France.</hi> I would not ſuffer Monſieur <hi>St. Olon</hi> to cloath us as he propos'd; for I had procur'd of the <hi>Jew</hi> four rich Suits of <hi>European</hi> Cloaths, for a Trifle, which I deſign'd for Mrs. <hi>Villars,</hi> and my ſelf; for we intended ſhe ſhould put off her <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Dreſs, the firſt Opportunity.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador provided a Cabin for Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi> and me; and he ſeem'd mightily taken with her Youth and Beauty, (as a Boy;) and he would often ſay, Nature had miſtaken her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning her for the faireſt of the ſofteſt Sex. Theſe Encomiums made me very uneaſy, fearing he ſhould find out the Truth. But I underſtood afterwards, he had not the leaſt Miſtruſt.</p>
            <p>He treated us very ſplendidly at Supper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering we were at Sea. When the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor went to Reſt, Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi> and I retir'd to the Cabin allotted us. What a ſenſible Pleaſure did I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0388100100:113"/>
feel, to have the Happineſs of her Company alone, without the Fears and Terrors of offending any one! She perceiv'd a Satisfaction in my Countenance, that ſpoke the Joy of my Heart; and by her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that enſu'd, ſhe was in ſome Fear, leſt a guilty Thought had work'd that Change.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I hope you know what Regard to pay my Sex, and do not wrong the good Opinion I have conceiv'd of you. I own the greateſt Obligation to you, and I am not diſpleas'd I am in your Power, while you uſe that Power with Moderation. I had hardly the Patience to hear her out. Madam, return'd I, be aſſur'd, your own Soul ſhall not be more pure than my Thoughts. But yet, I will take the Freedom to declare, no Perſon in the World has that Command over me as you have. I muſt own you have it in your Power to puniſh me, by ſlighting a Heart full of the moſt tender Regard for you; and all I ask, is only leave to hope; if I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd that, the utmoſt of my Reſentments to you, ſhall only be in hating Life, which will be a Burden not able for me long to bear. It would be baſe in me, (return'd Mrs. <hi>Villars)</hi> to give Tormens where I am oblig'd; I think to diſguiſe our Thoughts, is an Art better loſt, than learnt: And to deal frankly with you, I cannot find in my Heart any Averſion for you; which is a Declaration, if you knew my Temper, ought to ſatisfie you. I ſaid all the tender things I was capable of, in return for this great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and our Converſation laſted ſeveral Hours. I told her at laſt, I was well aſſur'd ſhe wanted Reſt; and whatever Pleaſure I took in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I would deprive my ſelf of it, and leave her to her Repoſe.</p>
            <p>She ſeem'd very much concern'd, that I was oblig'd to leave her alone; well knowing I
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0388100100:114"/>
ſhould not get the Convenience of a Place to reſt my ſelf.</p>
            <p>I told her there was not any Fatigue I would not undergo for her with Pleaſure. I left her, and Night ſoon ſlipt away in pleaſing Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I was ſurpriz'd to ſee her, who was ever in my Thoughts, come out of the Cabin dreſs'd. Madam, ſaid I to her, I hope you have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to diſturb your Sleep. She obligingly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd me, Nothing but the Thoughts of your waking; and therefore ſhe deſir'd I would go and repoſe my ſelf in the Cabin, and I think, ſaid ſhe, 'tis my Duty to watch now. I excus'd my ſelf, and told her it was but for one Night more, for in all Probability we ſhould land the next Day, and provide our ſelves with better Accommodation.</p>
            <p>We went into the Cabin together, and our Converſation chiefly center'd on Love. She told me at laſt, ſhe would leave her Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to me, till ſhe was more at Liberty, and in her own Country, for fear I ſhould imagine the Need ſhe had of my Service ſhould make her declare her ſelf in my Favour. When I found ſo fair a Beginning, I was reſolv'd to puſh my Fortune; till with many Intreaties, Vows, and Oaths of my Fidelity, ſhe own'd to me ſhe had a tender Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for me when ſhe ſaw me firſt, for ſhe was convinc'd of my Love at our firſt Converſation; not, continu'd ſhe, that I had any Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Art of Love, but I knew the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard you had put your ſelf in to ſerve me, could have no other Motive but that Paſſion; and the more I thought of it, the more I found my Heart inclining to believe you.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Perſons that have felt the ſoft Paſſion, may make a Judgment of the Tranſports I was in at this Declaration. I kiſs'd her Hand a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0388100100:115"/>
times, and preſs'd it to my Heart. She begg'd me to curb my Tranſport, for fear of being overheard or obſerved; for, continu'd ſhe, you may remember, in my Relation of my Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, how near we were ſuffering by ſuch an Overſight. This kind Caution bridled my Tongue, but could not command my Eyes; they ſpoke the Language of my Soul.</p>
            <p>Our ſilent Converſation was diſturb'd by the Joy of the Sailors in diſcovering Land; and we thought it prudent to wait on the Ambaſſador, and congratulate him upon it. He receiv'd us very kindly, and told us he was pleas'd upon our Accounts, that we might recover on Shore the Fatigue of the Sea and our Captivity. The Captain told us we ſhould come to an Anchor before Dinner in the Port of <hi>Mammora.</hi> I was mightily ſurpriz'd to find we were got to the South of <hi>Sallee,</hi> and found that the Tempeſt had drove us back beyond <hi>Sallee</hi> ſeveral Leagues. This we ſtill eſteem'd a greater Happineſs, and if <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had not been guided by me, we had miſs'd the good Fortune of meeting with the <hi>French</hi> Veſſel, and of courſe made the Port of <hi>Sallee</hi> whether we would or no. Upon this Thought, I began to imagine that <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> as underſtanding the Mathematicks, knew where we were, and conſequently had deſign'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us. I communicated my Thoughts to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur St. <hi>Olon,</hi> and he came into my Sentiments. He immediately call'd the Captain of the Ship, and order'd <hi>Muſtapha</hi> to be ſtrictly guarded in his Abſence; and if any <hi>Moors</hi> came on Board, to prevent his ſeeing of them; but deſir'd that he might want nothing but his Liberty. When we came to an Anchor, the Captain was ſent on Shore to acquaint the <hi>Moors</hi> with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of an Ambaſſador from <hi>France;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0388100100:116"/>
the Fort ſaluted him with one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Guns, which was return'd from the Ship Gun for Gun. The Governour of <hi>Mammora</hi> in an Hour's time came on Board attended, who ſaluted our Ambaſſador, and begg'd he would have Patience to ſtay in the Ship, till he had acquainted the Emperor his Maſter with his Arrival. The Ambaſſador invited him to an Entertainment; and tho' I obſerv'd he refus'd Wine, yet he and his Retinue ſwallow'd the Punch ſo faſt that their Heads prov'd as light as their Heels. When they went on Shore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Cannon of the Ship gave 'em a Salvo, which was return'd by the Fort aſſoon as ever they were landed. The next Day an Order came from the Emperor that we ſhould immediately repair to <hi>Mequinez,</hi> the Place where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror reſided.</p>
            <p>The next Day the Ambaſſador ſet forward with his whole Retinue, among which were Mrs. <hi>Villars,</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> and my ſelf, dreſt richly after the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Faſhion. We were provided with <hi>Drome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries</hi> to carry us, all but the Ambaſſador, who was preſented with an <hi>Arabian</hi> Courſer. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Mile or two of <hi>Mequinez</hi> we perceiv'd the King at the Head of his Army in a great Plain. At firſt I thought it a Mark of Reſpect to the Ambaſſador of <hi>France;</hi> but found it was purely Accident, for our Guide led us out of the Way to avoid 'em.</p>
            <p>When we arriv'd at <hi>Mequinez,</hi> we were led to a Houſe belonging to the <hi>French</hi> Conſul, or rather a Houſe he had hir'd for that Occaſion. Before we were well enter'd the Houſe, a Guard of <hi>Moors</hi> was fixt upon us, and ſtrict Orders given not a Soul ſhould ſtir out, not even the Ambaſſador nor Conſul. I thought this an odd Proceeding, and ſometimes imagin'd it was upon
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0388100100:117"/>
our Account, (as Fear is an expeditious Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.) But my Timerity vaniſh'd, when Monſieur St. <hi>Olon</hi> inform'd me, it was the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Cuſtom not to let a Foreign Ambaſſador give or receive Viſits till after his firſt Audience.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi> and I had one Apartment alotted us, with but one Bed in it, after the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Manner. She told me, ſhe could not bear the Thoughts of my watching every Night, and begg'd I would go to Reſt with the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> but we found he was provided of a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, one of the Retinue, and there was no help for it. I always retir'd when my Miſtreſs undreſs'd herſelf, and gave her time to go into Bed: I then with a Quilt laid my ſelf down on the Floor, but was far from taking any Repoſe. The Thoughts of the Woman I lov'd being ſo near me, naked in Bed, kindled ſuch a Deſire in my Breaſt; and the Pain I took to ſmother it, perfectly burnt me up. I would have my Readers excuſe me, if they are diſoblig'd at any Part of my Story, becauſe I am only relating Matters of Fact.</p>
            <p>The next Day, when I roſe from my board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bed, I retir'd to give the Loadſtone of my Deſires time to dreſs her ſelf: When I enter'd the Room again, ſhe obſerv'd my Countenance very attentively, and told me ſhe was griev'd to find in my Features ſomething that ſpoke a diſorder'd Body; which I am ſure, ſaid ſhe, is for want of Reſt: But, added ſhe, I beg it as a Favour, you will immediately undreſs your ſelf, and go into Bed, and try to repoſe your ſelf, and I'll make your Excuſe to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. I refus'd it a great while, but in ſhort ſhe forc'd me to comply with her Commands. I went to Bed, but new Thoughts again at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd me, and drove Sleep away. Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0388100100:118"/>
had retir'd, and ſtaid about an Hour. When ſhe came in again, ſhe ſtole ſoftly for fear of diſturbing me. My Mind was ſo violently agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, that I really began to be out of Order, and feaveriſh, which ſhe obſerv'd, and came to the Bed-ſide, and with a tender Inquietude ask'd me how I did. I took hold of her Hand, preſs'd it to my Lips, and thank'd her for her kind Care of me. Alas! ſhe cry'd, you are very much indiſpos'd, and I am the Cauſe of it. Upon this the Tears ran down her Cheeks, like Morning Dew on Roſes. Her Tenderneſs gave me all the Joy imaginable; and as ſhe lean'd her Head over me, weeping, I preſs'd her ſoft Lips cloſe to mine, which plung'd my Soul in Ecſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Joy. She bluſh'd at my Freedom, yet ſtill begg'd I would try to ſleep. I told her it was impoſſible, while ſhe was there; upon this ſhe was going to retire in haſte, but I caught her by the ſoft Hand, and told her if ſhe went out it would be a greater Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for me to reſt. She conjur'd me by that Love I profeſs'd, (if it was not a Falſhood) to declare to her the Torments of my Mind. She inſiſted ſo much upon't, that I told her the Secret of my Heart. She fell upon her Knees, and begg'd I would not mention it any more, for ſhe own'd her ſelf ſo much oblig'd to me, there was not any thing in her Power ſhe could refuſe me, but that. I begg'd her Pardon, and had reſolv'd to ſuffer Death ſooner than to have diſclos'd my Malady; but I would be ever ſilent upon that Theme, till ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to ſpeak. My dear <hi>Boyle,</hi> ſaid ſhe, (I am not aſham'd to call you ſo) ſtay till we arrive in <hi>England,</hi> and I here vow to make you mine, whenever you ſhall command me. Upon ſaying this ſhe join'd her Lips to mine, not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0388100100:119"/>
conſidering that in endeavouring to ſuppreſs my Flame, ſhe pour'd Oyl upon it, and made it burn the fiercer. I told her, true Love was above nice Formality, and that Marriages were made in Heaven. Said ſhe, I hope they are, but beg by both our Loves to drop this Theme. I told her I would, tho' Death ſhould follow. I remain'd ſilent for ſome time, while Tears ſtopt her Speech. We were interrupted by a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from the Ambaſſador, who came to invite us to Dinner, (for he always did us the Favour of dining at his Table.) I begg'd to be excus'd, for I found my ſelf a little indiſpos'd. The Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger had not been gone a Moment before the Ambaſſador came in to enquire after my Health, and brought his Phyſician with him, who feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Pulſe, told him I was in a Fever, but Bleeding he did not doubt would give me Eaſe. I told him I ſhould be better in the Morning, if not, I would take his Advice. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor would have Mr. <hi>Villars,</hi> (as we had nam'd her) to Dinner with him, who had endeavour'd to compoſe her ſelf while they had been in the Room. As ſhe was going from me, ſhe ſqueez'd my Hand, and ſaid, Endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelf to Reſt, and you'll ſoon be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>They retir'd and left me to my own Thoughts, which were various and disjointed. Mrs. <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> did not ſtay long; ſhe came in ſoftly as before, expecting that I might have been aſleep. When ſhe found I was in the ſame Diſorder, ſhe burſt into Tears, and cry'd, Will nothing ſatisfy you but my Undoing? No Madam, ſaid I, I will fight with my Deſires, and am reſolv'd to conquer or die. She ſtaid with me till Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and our whole Diſcourſe was upon the Paſſion of Love. When ſhe came back from
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0388100100:120"/>
Supper, I had got up and had dreſt my ſelf; but the Combat in my Mind had really diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd my Body, which ſhe ſoon ſaw: She begg'd I would go to Bed again, and ſhe would watch me. I told her, the World ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon me to break her Reſt; nor even ſhe her ſelf, who was more to me than the World. I had ſat me down upon the Bed, and Mrs. <hi>Villars</hi> came and ſat down by me. We remain'd ſilent a conſiderable time: at laſt ſhe took my Hands in hers, and preſs'd me by the Fingers.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I have overcome my ſelf: I cannot ſee you in this Torture of Body and Mind, and not contribute to your Eaſe. Here ſolemnly ſwear to be my Husband, and do with me what you pleaſe: I hope you are a Man of Honour, and that's what I rely upon. Nothing in this World could have tranſported me ſo much as thoſe few Words did: I fell upon my Knees, kiſs'd her Hands, and did I know not what! Madam, ſaid I, you have made me the happieſt Man the World contains; and if I thought my Heart and Tongue did not agree in what I am going to ſay, I would pull 'em both out this Moment. When I had ſaid this, I fell on my Knees, and made this ſhort Vow. <hi>Thou God that know'ſt the Heart of Man; I do beſeech Thee puniſh me with Eternity of Torments, if ever I prove falſe to this Darling of my Soul, who before Thee I take (as the greateſt Bleſſing) to be my lawful Wife. And here I ſwear</hi> (ſaid ſhe, kneeling) <hi>to take no other to my Bed and Heart; and with this Kiſs,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I ſeal the ſacred Union.</hi> I told her nothing could be more binding, and the Prieſt could but confirm what we had done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>Now the tender Moment was approaching to crown my Joys with all I wiſh'd on Earth,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0388100100:121"/>
Kings on their Thrones to me ſeem'd poor and baſe, and I'd not have chang'd to be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the Univerſe. I begg'd my dear Bride I might be her Bride-maid as well as Husband, and that ſhe would give me leave to undreſs her. Said ſhe, My Love, my Life, my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, I am to obey you in every thing that's in my Power, and when I fail in my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, may I be miſerable in the Loſs of you. I was too eager to ſay any thing in Return, but I undreſs'd her, put her to Bed, and you may be ſure I did not ſtay long behind. The Veil of Night was drawn round us, and I plung'd into a Sea of Pleaſures, too delicate for Words to expreſs.</p>
            <p>The next Day, the Ambaſſador ſaw Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in both our Faces, and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated me for the Recovery of my Health. Never was there ſo tender a Wife; and the longer I had the Happineſs of Enjoyment, the more my Love was rais'd. The next Day, the Ambaſſador was to have his firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and we were all to be in Readineſs by Seven in the Morning. I got up early, and dreſs'd my dear Wife in a new Suit of Clothes, on purpoſe for this Occaſion. The Governour of <hi>Alcaſſar, Hamet addo Riffy,</hi> was to be our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Ceremonies, who attended us with ſeveral <hi>Moors</hi> of Quality, and a Troop of the King's Blacks, as Guards. We ſet forward about eight a-clock, in this Order. 1. Twelve of the <hi>Moor</hi> Guards. 2. Several of the Nobility, two by two. 3. The Ambaſſador, with <hi>Hamet addo Riffy</hi> on his Right Hand, preceded by two Trumpets and Kettle-Drums, (the Poſt of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is on the Left among <hi>Moors,</hi> becauſe you have the Command of their Sword.) 4. Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four Gentlemen of the Ambaſſador's Train,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0388100100:122"/>
two by two. 5. Twelve <hi>French</hi> Slaves that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the Preſents. 6. Twelve more of the Guards: And the Order was clos'd by a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Mob, that abus'd us with their Tongues all they could; nay ſome of them attempted to throw Stones, but were baſtinado'd by the Guards. We were all on Foot, though the King's Palace was a Mile from the Place where we ſet out.</p>
            <p>I was mightily concern'd at the Fatigue my dear Wife underwent, for it was violent hot; tho' we had the beſt on't, for going next the Ambaſſador (who order'd we ſhould do ſo) we had ſome Shelter from the Umbrella that was carried over his Head.</p>
            <p>We enter'd the Palace through the Marble Gate, (ſo call'd from two Marble Pillars that adorn it) and from thence, immur'd with white Walls and black Guards on each Side, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at a ſtately Pavilion; where a Halt was commanded 'till the King was acquainted with our Arrival. We waited ſome Time, but at laſt ſaw him coming, mounted on a white Horſe, through one of the Avenues that led to the Pavilion. His Guards (who had lin'd that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage on each Side) bow'd down to the Ground as he paſs'd along. He made but a very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Appearance. Aſſoon as he came to the Portico, he gave a Launce that he bore to one of his Guard, got from his Horſe, and ſquatted down upon the Floor without any thing under him. He had nothing in his Dreſs to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from the reſt of his Subjects, but was muffled up to the Eyes with a Chocolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour Handkerchief, that did not ſeem over clean. His Legs and Arms were bare: As to his Age, he ſeem'd to be about Fifty; of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tawny Complexion, and very lean; his Hair black, inclining to grey; of a middle Stature,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0388100100:123"/>
with hollow Cheeks, and Eyes black, a ſmall hook'd Noſe, and thick Lips. Some of his Courtiers ſat down on each Side of him, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legg'd and bare-headed; and behind him ſtood a Black with a great Fan in his Hand, not only to cool him, but to keep off the Muskito's, a ſmall Fly, very troubleſome in moſt Parts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahumet ben Addo Otar,</hi> his chief Miniſter and Favourite, was the only Perſon that ſtood.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as the Emperor had ſquatted down on the Floor, he repeated theſe Words in <hi>Arabic</hi> three times, <hi>Tay buon,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>You are welcome;</hi> a common Expreſſion when they are addreſs'd to by a Foreigner. Then our Ambaſſador made a long Speech in <hi>French,</hi> prepar'd for that Purpoſe; which was only a Panegyric upon both Kings, fulſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but the <hi>French</hi> deal much in wordy Compliments. The Interpreter, when the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador had done, read the ſame in <hi>Arabic</hi> to the Emperor. The Speech was very long in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Arabic,</hi> but the Emperor heard it out patiently, which was reckon'd a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; he alſo excus'd himſelf that he did not admit him ſooner to his Audience, it being their <hi>Ramadan,</hi> or <hi>Eaſter.</hi> When the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were over, the Ambaſſador preſented all his Retinue to the Emperor, but I obſerv'd he took a particular Notice of my Wife, and ey'd her ſeveral times, which gave me a great deal of Uneaſineſs; for it is as dangerous to be a handſome Man as a handſome Woman in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi> if the Brute of an Emperor ſhould have a Fancy for 'em.</p>
            <p>I long'd to have an end of our Audience.</p>
            <p>After we were preſented, the Ambaſſador or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Preſents to be open'd and ſpread before
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0388100100:124"/>
the Emperor; which conſiſted of fine Arms made at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Watches and Cloth, two <hi>Perſian</hi> Carpets, and two Pieces of Gold and Silver Brocade. The Emperor, in return, gave the Ambaſſador four young Slaves, three of 'em <hi>French,</hi> (tho' he took 'em all for the ſame Nation) but the other was an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and the ſame Perſon I mentioned in the Beginning of this Relation, who went in the ſame Boat on Board of the <hi>Succeſs.</hi> I was very much confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at ſeeing him, well knowing he was on Board when I fell out of the Ship. I long'd for an Opportunity to confer with him, tho' I could not perceive by his Looks that he knew me; but that might be from my Change of Habit, and the Sun's tarniſhing my Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The Emperor roſe, (when he had given the Slaves) mounted, and rode off; and we went home in the ſame Order as we came there; only the chief Miniſter, <hi>Mahumet ben Addo Otar,</hi> accompany'd the Ambaſſador as far as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gate. I inform'd my dear Wife, when we came to our Lodging, the Anxiety I was in when the Emperor ey'd her: She told me ſhe had made the ſame Obſervation with much Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; for, ſaid ſhe, I had not the Preſence of Mind, upon the Inſtant, to imagine my ſelf a Man. However, we both wiſh'd our ſelves on Board, and the Embaſſy well over, and then we might make ourſelves merry with our Fears.</p>
            <p>The next Day our Fears were much encreas'd; for hearing a Noiſe in the Street, we went to look out to know the Reaſon, and diſcover'd <hi>Hamet,</hi> our <hi>Iriſh</hi> Renegado, with ſeveral Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners manacled. We ſoon retir'd again, but learnt by other People, that they were going to the Emperor, that he might make his Choice. The
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0388100100:125"/>
Sight of him renew'd our Fears, as I ſaid, and we reſolv'd immediately to get Leave to go on Board, for fear of ſome unlucky Turn of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>I upon the Inſtant went to wait on the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, and declar'd to him what I had ſeen, begging Leave at the ſame time we might be ſuffer'd to go on Board. He told me he would comply with my Requeſt for Mr. <hi>Villars</hi> and the <hi>Italian,</hi> but begg'd it as a Favour that I would ſtay with him, for he ſhould have great need of my Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and if any thing ſhould fall out, he would engage for my Liberty. Though the Requeſt cut me to the Heart, yet it was neither Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence nor good Manners to refuſe him. I gave him my Promiſe to obey his Commands, but begg'd he would not inſiſt upon my going abroad but as ſeldom as poſſible. I went to my Wife, (my Readers, perhaps, may ſmile at my calling her <hi>Wife,</hi> but I will aſſure 'em we thought our ſelves as much marry'd, as if the Parſon had execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his holy Function; nevertheleſs we did not intend to neglect that Ceremony the very firſt Opportunity) and told her the Ambaſſador's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and my Promiſe. She agreed with me in the Reaſonableneſs of it, but yet could not forbear ſhedding Floods of Tears at our (we hop'd) ſhort Separation. The next Day was deſign'd for their Journey; but the enſuing Night was ſpent with Sighs, Tears, and a Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit that look'd ominous. Yet we parted; and for ſeveral Hours I could not bring my Mind to any peaceable Form to wait on the Ambaſſador: But he ſent for me at laſt, and told me the Reaſon of his deſiring me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with him was this:—</p>
            <p>The King his Maſter had commanded him to make ſome Obſervation of the Cuſtoms and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0388100100:126"/>
Manners of this Part of <hi>Africa;</hi> and, added he, I have obſerved in you a Capacity fit to aſſiſt me in the Deſign. I told him he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me in any thing that lay in my Power, and that I took it for an Honour he would think me worth his Employment.</p>
            <p>We had Notice the next Day from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that attended my Wife with the Camels, that he ſaw them ſafe on board, which gave me ſome Comfort. I begg'd the Ambaſſador to give me Leave to ſpeak a Word or two with one of the Slaves that the Emperor gave him. He order'd him to come before him, where I deſir'd he would tell me how he came into the Hands of the <hi>Moors.</hi> He was prodigiouſly ſurpriz'd to ſee me there, and could hardly believe his Eyes; for it was thought by every Body that I had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been kill'd or drown'd; as indeed it was very improbable to think otherwiſe. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd us, that three Days after the <hi>Succeſs</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War, another <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerine</hi> Rover met with them, and took 'em af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an obſtinate Fight; the Captain and ſeveral others being ſlain in the Battle. It was his good Fortune to be bought for the Emperor's Uſe; I call it good Fortune, ſaid he, becauſe I was preſented to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, and am now in Hopes of my Freedom.</p>
            <p>I told the Ambaſſador in <hi>French</hi> what he ſaid; and he was pleas'd to ſay, that to oblige me he would take him into his Protection. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd <hi>Mahumet ben Addo Otar</hi> was Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in <hi>England;</hi> He came to viſit the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor often, and underſtanding <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I gather'd ſeveral good Hints for his Deſign; for he was courteous enough, though an Enemy in his Heart to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

I think it will not be much amiſs here to give the Reader a ſuccinct Account of the Cuſtoms and Manners of the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco;</hi> and we will firſt begin from their laſt Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muley Iſmael,</hi> the preſent Emperor of <hi>Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> pretends to derive his Birth from <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf. He was Son to <hi>Muley Xerif,</hi> King of <hi>Taphilet,</hi> but was ſucceeded by <hi>Muley Archyd,</hi> who dy'd with a Debauch he made among his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</p>
            <p>His unexpected Death in 1672 gave room for many of his Family to raiſe Rebellion in their ſeveral Provinces: But <hi>Muley Iſmael</hi> being the greateſt Favourite of the People, and of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing Temper, proclaim'd himſelf King of <hi>Taphilet,</hi> and ſeiz'd his Brother's Treaſures, which are the Sinews of War. His Nephew, <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> gave him the moſt Trouble; for he had gain'd a Party, and declar'd himſelf King of <hi>Sus</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> had ſeveral Battels, but at laſt was overcome as well as the reſt, and <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> was ſettled the peaceful King of <hi>Taphilet, Morocco,</hi> and <hi>Fez.</hi> I have given a Deſcription of his Perſon already. His Empire ſpreads from North to South four hundred Leagues, from Eaſt to Weſt upwards of a hundred and fifty.</p>
            <p>There are three ſtrong Places poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Europeans</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Afric.</hi> Firſt <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan</hi> on the Ocean, by the <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> and on the <hi>Mediterranean, Meliſſa</hi> and <hi>Ceuta</hi> by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> They had two more ſtrong Holds, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rache,</hi> and <hi>Mammora;</hi> but the preſent Emperor drove them out ſhamefully. And <hi>Tangier</hi> once belong'd to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who abandon'd it a few Years ago, firſt demoliſhing the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0388100100:128"/>
The Emperor has but nine Sea-Ports in his whole Dominions, viz. <hi>Sancta Cruz, Safy, Sallee, Mammora, Larache, Arzilla,</hi> and <hi>Tangier,</hi> on the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric</hi> Ocean; <hi>Zaffarina</hi> and <hi>Tetuan</hi> on the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean;</hi> though <hi>Tetuan</hi> is two Leagues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Land. To begin in Order as they are nam'd; <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi> (or the <hi>Holy Croſs)</hi> is the firſt Port to the Southward. The Town is about a Mile in Length, and a Quarter broad. The chief Merchants are <hi>Jews,</hi> who trade with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> Their Vent is Hides, Dates, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Bees-wax.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Safy,</hi> or <hi>Sophia,</hi> appears next, a Town ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a Hill; but drives a larger Trade than <hi>Sancta Cruz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sallee,</hi> ſituated 35 Leagues S. W. of <hi>Cape Spartel.</hi> It is divided into two Towns, the old and the new; (it is called by the Natives <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.)</hi> There's a very good Harbour, and a ſtrong Caſtle well ſtor'd with Guns, if the <hi>Moors</hi> knew how to make uſe of them. The Town is large, and well inhabited, but the Walls are all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd. I obſerv'd the Ruins of a Church, the Steeple yet ſtanding, a noble fine <hi>Gothic</hi> Building. The chief Trade of this Town con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Prizes that are brought in by their Gallies.</p>
            <p>About ſeven Leagues more to the North ſtands <hi>Mammora,</hi> once poſſeſſed by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> It ſtands in a Bottom ſurrounded with Mountains, which renders the Air very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome, by reaſon of the exceſſive Heat; but the Bay is fine, large, and ſecure from all Winds. This Town is generally the high Road to <hi>Mequinez,</hi> the preſent Capital of <hi>Morocco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Port Northward is <hi>Larache,</hi> a Town of a pleaſant Situation, and ſtrongly fortified; but, to the eternal Infamy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0388100100:129"/>
up to <hi>Iſmael</hi> after a Siege of five Moons; two thouſand Soldiers and a hundred Officers taken Priſoners: a ſufficient Force to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it againſt the whole Powers of <hi>Muley Iſmael,</hi> for they neither wanted Proviſions nor Ammunition. But we ſhall leave them and their Cowardice, and go on to</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arzilla,</hi> or <hi>Azilath,</hi> about twelve Leagues more North. A Place only fam'd for Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, which they ſeldom trade abroad for, having ſufficient Vent for it among the Natives of <hi>Morocco;</hi> and as we have but little Buſineſs with it, we'll come to</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tangier</hi> as faſt as we can, a fine, large, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortified City, when in the Hands of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;</hi> but ſince they have left it, and raz'd the Fortifications, the <hi>Moors</hi> have not thought fit to repair it.</p>
            <p>The next, <hi>Zaffarina,</hi> is a Place of very little Note, and therefore we ſhall make no Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation concerning it.</p>
            <p>The laſt is <hi>Tetuan,</hi> a Town ſix Miles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Land, without any Fortification. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitans came originally from the Province of <hi>Andaluſia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> as indeed did moſt of the <hi>Moors</hi> on the Sea-Coaſts of <hi>Africa.</hi> They are white Men, pretty well civiliz'd, very kind to Strangers and Chriſtians, and pay but little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Emperor of <hi>Morocco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Nature of the Inhabitants, they are moſt of a tawny Complexion, of a lazy, idle Diſpoſition, and curs'd with all the Vices of Mankind; miſtruſtful to the laſt Degree, falſe, jealous, and the very Picture of Ignorance. They ſtyle themſelves <hi>Muſſulmen,</hi> or true Believers, yet their Word is not to be rely'd upon on any Occaſion. The <hi>Moors</hi> are generally but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Soldiers, and but ſeldom brave. They
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0388100100:130"/>
are often fam'd in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtories for Men of Gallantry, but I could never find them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd that way. They manage a Horſe, it muſt be confeſt, with a great deal of Dexterity. They abominate the Chriſtians, for the very Word ſignifies in their Language, <hi>Dog;</hi> and are continually ſeeking Means to deſtroy them. <hi>Mahomet</hi> has taught 'em in his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that all of his Faith who dye fighting againſt the Chriſtians, immediately enter into Paradiſe in Triumph; nay, even their Horſes, if they did in Battle, are immediately tranſlated into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for they hope to have the Pleaſure of Riding there, as well as on Earth.</p>
            <p>Though Poligamy is allow'd, yet they muſt marry but four Wives, and muſt ſettle a Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon them; and if they ever put 'em away, they muſt return their Dowry along with 'em: But they may keep as many Concubines as they think fit; tho' they have this Privilege, when they can pleaſe 'em no longer, they ſell 'em to the beſt Bidder; ſo that the Women of <hi>Morocco,</hi> in my Opinion, have but a ſad Time on't: yet the Husband is oblig'd to keep all their Children. They eſteem Ideots and Naturals to be Saints, if they are Men; for they believe the Women have no Souls, and are only form'd for Propagation. They will not allow 'em to enter their Moſques, becauſe they eſteem 'em unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being receiv'd into Heaven: Yet they ſay their Prayers at home, and on <hi>Fridays</hi> reſort to the Places of Burial, to weep over the Graves of their deceas'd Friends, cloath'd in Blue, which is their Mourning. They hire profeſs'd Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to grieve and cry at the Graves of Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and howl over them, as I have heard the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> asking them why they would die when they were provided with every thing that was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0388100100:131"/>
neceſſary in this World. Their Time is ſpent in Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Dallying with their Women, Horſes, and Prayers (for they never learn to read, and are forbid Gaming) and even their Prayers are hurried over ſo ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if they were aſleep.</p>
            <p>They have uſually a String of Beads in their Hands, like the <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> and to every Bead they have a ſhort Prayer, which as they repeat, they drop through their Fingers. The Prayer conſiſts only in the different Attributes of God, as, <hi>God is great, God is good, God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, God is merciful.</hi> The Emperor of theſe Wretches only differs from his Subjects in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Propenſity to their ill Qualities, with the Addition of a degree of Cruelty and Avarice. I was told, that during his twenty Years Reign he had murder'd with his own Hands twenty three thouſand Men: Nay I am apt to believe the Truth of it, for he put forty ſeven to Death in the one and twenty Days we were at his Court.</p>
            <p>Every Nation is amaz'd to find his Subjects ſo ſubmiſſive and patient under ſo exceſſive and cruel a Tyranny: But they ſhould underſtand (bating their Want of Power) that they are taught to believe, if they fall by the Hand of a King who is a <hi>Xerif,</hi> (which ſignifies <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor) they immediately go up to Heaven; and if there is any that would not willingly be ſent to Heaven before their Time, they are ſure to fly him when he is cloath'd in Yellow, which is his Colour of Murder; and he generally dyes it of a Blood-colour before he goes to Sleep.</p>
            <p>As I was viewing ſome new Buildings one Day, near the King's Palace, I perceiv'd him giving Directions to ſome of the Workmen. There were ſeveral Carts drove by his Slaves
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0388100100:132"/>
with Materials for his Building; and as they paſs'd him, he baſtinado'd ſome for going too faſt, while others, thinking to mend that Fault, were drubb'd by him for going too ſlow; one poor Creature, trembling for fear of what would follow, went bowing before his Cart; but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror wounding the Horſe in the Flank, he gave a Spring, tumbled the Wretch down, and drove over him. Another following him, ran to aſſiſt his Fellow, but the Emperor threw his Dart, and ſtruck him in the Shoulder. The Slave drew it out, and upon his Knees preſented it to him again, which the Emperor (when the Man had got ſome Diſtance from him) darted into his Chine. The Fool drew it out once more, and, cover'd with Blood, gave it to him back again; but as he was ſtooping, he fell down with loſs of Blood at the Barbarian's Feet, who did him the Favour to pin him to the Earth through his Back.</p>
            <p>I was ſo ſhock'd at the Sight, that I could not recover my ſelf for a good while afterwards. I thought the poor Fellow was a Fool; for if it had been my own Caſe, I would have return'd it through his Body the firſt Time, for he was ſure of Dying, and I think it would have been ſome Satisfaction to have ſent the Author of my Death the ſame Journey.</p>
            <p>This King us'd to murder his Slaves upon the leaſt Complaint from the <hi>Moors,</hi> which they would make out of hatred to Chriſtians. But the Wretch finding his Slaves decreaſe too much, took another Method; and when the next Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was made, he killed the Slave, the Perſon complain'd againſt, but order'd the Complainant immediately to pay him double the Price he coſt him, or find him two more Slaves in his Room that Inſtant, which he was oblig'd to do; but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0388100100:133"/>
this Proceeding ſtopt their Mouths for the future.</p>
            <p>They ſay he has a great deal of Wit and Courage, is very active, and expert in riding, and hurling the Dart. He drinks no Wine, becauſe his Religion forbids it: but when he takes Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, or drinks a certain Mixture that he makes himſelf, compounded with Brandy, Cinamon, Cloves, Anniſeed, and Nutmegs, woe be to him that comes in his Way. He's much addicted to Women, having no leſs than four hundred Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines. He has one hundred and eighteen Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alive, and about two hundred Females. One of the Males whom he deſigns for his Succeſſor, (and which he had by a Black, who adviſes him in every thing, and is reckon'd a politic Woman) he has named <hi>Muley Zeyden.</hi> His Revenue conſiſts in Preſents from the Governors of his Provinces, and the <hi>Arabians</hi> who live in Huts about his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. When he has a mind to ſqueeze, he ſends for a Governor from his Province, who knows well enough what he is ſent to for, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore provides accordingly; ſo that the Emperor fleeces the Governors, and they fleece the People. So that there is no one rich but himſelf, and yet he does not know what Uſe to put his Treaſure to, but hides it in ſecret Places; and the Perſon that aſſiſts him in the Concealment is ſure to loſe his Life for his Aſſiſtance.</p>

               <hi>Mequinez,</hi> the Capital, and the Place of his Reſidence, was formerly but a ſmall Village, but now it contains ſix hundred thouſand Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and the Streets are ſo crowded, there's hardly any paſſing along. It is but a mean City, very ill built; and, if there falls any Rain, the dirtieſt Place I ever ſet my Foot in; for there is no Pavement in the Streets; and when it is dry the Duſt is ready to choak one. The King's
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0388100100:134"/>
Palace is indeed a very large Place, almoſt four Miles round, including his Gardens; but it is very ill contriv'd. Here you ſhall ſee a fine Pillar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſupport an old ruinated Place, and yet he employs moſt of his Time in Building. In ſhort, it looks like gold Lace upon a Hop-ſack.</p>
            <p>His Stables are the moſt regular Building in all his Palace. But that's no wonder, for the <hi>Moors</hi> even reverence Horſes; and one that has been a Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca,</hi> has as much Veneration as the Pilgrim himſelf. The King had one of theſe Horſes, which I have ſeen always finely capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon'd, and a Slave to attend, who carry'd a Pot and a Cloth to keep him Clean. All the Horſes that are thus ſanctify'd are uſually freed from all manner of Service, and if the Owner cannot afford to keep it, which often happens, there is a Penſion ſettled upon 'em by the <hi>Mufty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> drive a great Trade here, but they pay ſufficiently for that Privilege; for they are oblig'd to wear black Caps, that they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd; and notwithſtanding their great Trade, they are but ſcurvily us'd, for if a Child inſults 'em, it is as much as their Lives are worth to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>The Women of <hi>Morocco,</hi> I mean all that I had the Fortune to ſee, were very handſome, fine large full Eyes, round Faces, and every Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exact. They are very amorous, and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in contriving Methods to ſatisfie their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman of our Retinue told me, he had got an Intrigue with one of the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Daughter to a Governor of a Province; and his manner of going to the Appointment was in Diſguiſe. She ſent him by a <hi>French</hi> Slave of hers a complete Woman's Dreſs, which are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0388100100:135"/>
generally all alike; and their Faces are all muffled up to their Eyes, ſo that they are often met by their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Husbands in the Street, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known; by this Dreſs he got Admittance as a Lady coming to pay a Viſit, and then they are very ſecure. For it is the Cuſtom, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Man, even the Husband, finds a pair of Women's Sandals, at the Door of his Wife's Chamber, he muſt retire; for it is the greateſt Affront they can put on a Woman, to enter her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they have that Warning to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. He told me ſhe was a delicious Creature, and Miſtreſs of the whole Art of Love. It is no wonder if they give themſelves up to Love, when perhaps there are twenty, or more, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Capacity of the Perſon that keeps 'em) Sharers in one ſingle Man; and they muſt be contented to ſtay for due Benevolence, till their Tyrant pleaſes to ſend for 'em.</p>
            <p>The Habit of the Men is generally White, (which is a Colour they extreamly delight in) with a red Cap on their Heads; that is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Men; for all the Youth, from the Prince to the Beggar, before Wedlock, go uncover'd. They are cloſe ſhav'd under their Caps, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Lock upon the Crown of their Heads, which they never cut off; being they are taught, by that Lock, <hi>Mahomet</hi> is to draw 'em up to their imaginary Paradiſe. They only ſhave under their Chins, but ſuffer their Beards and Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes to grow, which they take a particular Pride in the Length or Largeneſs of; and he that's well bearded, <hi>muſt</hi> be a wiſe Man.</p>
            <p>Their Shirts are made like Shifts, only the Sleeves are ſo long that they hang down over their Hands. Under the Shirt they were linen Drawers, that reach down to their Knees, for their Legs are always bare; their Shoes are made
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0388100100:136"/>
without Heels, like <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brogues. Over the Shirt is a Veſt without Sleeves, which they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round with a ſilk Scarf, of what Colour they pleaſe (except Green, which is a Colour ſacred to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> their Emperor, and the Clergy;) in this they thruſt ſhort Daggers, or Knives. Over all, is a Garment, which they call a <hi>Hayick,</hi> about five Ells long, and four broad, which they wrap round 'em, as we do our Cloaks. Some of the meaner Sort, eſpecially in the Country, wear Straw-hats of their own Make. Their Dreſſes are all a-like, only ſome add a gold or ſilver Fringe round the Border.</p>
            <p>As for Religion, they riſe early and late to Prayers; but only like Children, do it becauſe they are order'd. Their <hi>Mufti,</hi> or Head of their Religion, is reckon'd the firſt in the Empire, and diſowns the Emperor's Authority; but yet he finds means to fleece him, as well as the reſt of his Subjects, who obey him out of Fear; for if there was one Perſon found to love him, it would be as ſtrange a Sight as one of their Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>I could not forbear ſmiling to ſee the Providence of the <hi>Moors.</hi> Walking one Day about a Mile from <hi>Mequinez,</hi> it began to rain prodigiouſly; I got under a Tree to ſhelter my ſelf from the Tempeſt. But I obſerv'd ſeveral of the Natives undreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a great deal of Precipitation, make up their Cloaths in a Bundle, and ſit on 'em ſtark naked; and all their Care was to keep 'em from the Wet, leaving their naked Bodies expos'd to the Fury of the Storm. When it ceas'd, they walk'd a little Way till their Bodies were dry, and then dreſs'd themſelves. If a Man were to do ſo in <hi>England,</hi> he would be counted a Madman, or a Fool, yet I muſt own I thought 'em in the right; for be the Storm ever ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0388100100:137"/>
yet when it's over, they purſue their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with dry Cloaths on their Backs. But they have one Conveniency, they are dreſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt in half a Minute. Nay, I am inform'd, thoſe that travel on Camels, or on Horſeback, have a Conveniency cover'd with an oyl'd Cloth, in which they thruſt their Cloaths on the like Occaſion, and ride naked. I fancy, to meet an Army in a Storm would create a terrible Fright, and do as much Execution to an Ignorant Body, as their offenſive Arms, and force 'em to ſeek for Safety in their Heels.</p>
            <p>The Emperor is able to raiſe an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and fifty thouſand Foot. When they are to make War among themſelves, they go very unwillingly into the Field; but when they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Chriſtians, they do it with a great deal of Chearfulneſs; becauſe they expect Indulgences for the Expiation of their Sins. When they are ready to give Battle, they range their Armies after this Manner. They divide their Horſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Bodies, and place one at each Wing, the Foot is in the Middle, ſo that the whole forms a Creſcent or half Moon. Before they begin the Battle, they give a great Shout, then make a ſhort Prayer, and fall on without much Order very furiouſly; ſo that they ſoon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, or are as ſoon put to flight. Break but their foremoſt Ranks, and you put their whole Body into Confuſion.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid before, that no Perſon is rich but the Emperor; neither do they take the Methods to be ſo; or if they are, their greateſt Wiſdom will be to conceal it; for if once known, they are ſure to loſe all their Wealth.</p>
            <p>No Foreign Coin is currant in <hi>Morocco,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pieces of Eight, which are only receiv'd by Weight. But the <hi>Jews</hi> will ſecretly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0388100100:138"/>
take any Coin, and I ſuppoſe diſpoſe of it again with the ſame Circumſpection they receive it. They have but three ſorts of Coin currant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 'em. The firſt a <hi>Ducat,</hi> of <hi>Barbary</hi> Gold. Second a <hi>Blanquile,</hi> of <hi>Silver.</hi> And laſt a <hi>Felowze,</hi> of Copper. The Image of the Emperor is not allow'd to be put on their Money, being expreſly forbid by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in his <hi>Alcoran;</hi> but they ſtamp 'em with <hi>Arabian</hi> Characters. Their way of reckoning is by the Ounce.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Heads of what I obſerv'd in my ſmall Stay among 'em. The Ambaſſador in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me, he was in ſome fear that his Embaſſy would not ſucceed; for he ſaid, he found little elſe but Delays, Excuſes, and nothing of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity among 'em. We were inform'd, that the Emperor deſign'd to go ſpeedily upon an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> of the Province of <hi>Oran,</hi> who had newly revolted, and put to Death their Governor for his Avarice; he having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from 'em vaſt Sums of Money; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants after his Death, choſe one of their own Province to command 'em. This haſten'd our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in his Legation, to get an Anſwer one way or other. But we were inform'd, the King deſign'd to ſet out the next Day upon his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and yet the Ambaſſador had not his Audience of Leave. This made him, and us, very uneaſy; for we could not ſtir from <hi>Mequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez,</hi> without the Emperor's expreſs Leave. But about ſeven in the Evening, the Ambaſſador had Orders to come and take his laſt Audience, which was the ninth of <hi>June</hi> 1693: We went in the ſame Manner, as we did at firſt. But we were inform'd by our Interpreter, that the King was in a very ill Humour, and that he had but an Hour before kill'd two of his chief Blacks,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0388100100:139"/>
by ſtabbing 'em with a Dagger he continually wore at his Girdle.</p>
            <p>We enter'd the Palace further than the firſt Time, where we waited a full half Hour. At laſt the Emperor approach'd richly dreſt, and finely mounted upon a white <hi>Barbary;</hi> the Saddle and other Accoutrements wrought with Gold and precious Stones in ſeveral Places. He was this Day in his Yellow, or Fatal Veſt, and ſprinkled in many Places with the Blood of thoſe he had ſlain; and I thought his Countenance had ſomething more of Horror in't, than at our firſt Audience. He had a Spear in his Hand, ſet round with Pearls on the Top, and a Cap with Eſtriches Feathers waving in the Wind. All his Attendants had fled his Preſence, at the Notice of his having on his yellow Veſt; and he had only about a dozen of his Guards wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him trembling, but the <hi>Alcaydes</hi> and other great Men crept about us during our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>The Emperor begun with his old Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>You're wellcome,</hi> but his Looks and his Words I thought did but ill agree. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador us'd many Arguments with him to bring his Embaſſy to a happy Iſſue, but to no Purpoſe. The Ambaſſador told me, the King was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that had not the leaſt Regard to his Word, and even diſown'd a Letter he had written to his Maſter the King of <hi>France.</hi> Therefore, ſaid he, we'll take our leave of this Country of Monſters in two Days: for the King had ſign'd his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with all his Retinue.</p>
            <p>I was very well pleas'd with this his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for now I ſhould once more ſee that Treaſure of my Soul, whoſe Abſence had robb'd me of all Joy. I even thought theſe two Days the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0388100100:140"/>
longeſt of my Life; but at laſt they were paſt, and we ſet out very merrily; at leaſt I did, and all the reſt of the Retinue. Tho' I muſt own I could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the Ambaſſador, for I believe the ill Succeſs of his Embaſſy had a little chagrin'd him. I did my utmoſt Endeavour to divert his Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly upon the Road, which he took very kindly. We lay in Tents the firſt Night, which the Ambaſſador had taken care to provide us, and Proviſion likewiſe; for there is never an Inn between <hi>Mequinez</hi> and <hi>Mammora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We roſe the next Day very early, that we might avoid the Heat of the Sun. When we came within a League of the Town, we ſaw coming towards us our <hi>Italian,</hi> and by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy in his Looks, I began to tremble with Apprehenſion of ſome Accident. Aſſoon as he approach'd us, after paying his Obedience to the Ambaſſador, he addreſs'd himſelf to me. Said he, in <hi>French,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh ſome one elſe would have taken my Commiſſion upon 'em, for what I have to tell you will cut you to the Heart. The various Troubles in my Breaſt lock'd up my Tongue, ſo that I had not Power to ask him any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. In ſhort, ſaid he, your Miſtreſs is forc'd away from us, through the Treachery of <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha.</hi> At hearing this fatal News, I drop'd ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from my <hi>Camel,</hi> nor came to my ſelf till we arriv'd at <hi>Mammora.</hi> I was a thouſand times going to deſtroy my ſelf; and I believe I had done it in the height of my Deſpair, if I had not been withheld. In ſhort, the Ambaſſador was no longer ignorant of my cruel Loſs: For in my Ravings, I had call'd her my dear Wife. He ſeem'd amaz'd at the Diſcovery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd me in a handſome Manner, for not truſting him with the Secret. I was not in a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0388100100:141"/>
Condition to beg his Pardon, neither was there any one could give me Comfort. I was carry'd on Board, where I enquir'd in what manner ſhe was taken away.</p>
            <p>The Captain inform'd us, that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had made his Eſcape out of the Cabin Window, by ſwimming. I did not tell any one of it, ſaid the Captain, becauſe I thought it would be to no Purpoſe; for I imagin'd there could be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill Conſequence to attend his Eſcape, but meerly the Loſs of him. He had been gone three Days, when on the fourth there came on board us the Governor of <hi>Mammora,</hi> the Fugitive <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and one hundred Soldiers, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſeiz'd on the young Gentleman, whom they ſaid was a Woman, and Wiſe to a Renegado of <hi>Sallee.</hi> It was in vain to oppoſe 'em, eſpecially when I found by her Breaſts, that ſhe was really a Woman. They took her on Shore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flanding all her Cries, Shrieks and Lamentations, which pierc'd our very Hearts. They put her on board a <hi>Saick,</hi> and ſet Sail immediately, ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing South, as we ſuppoſe for the Port of <hi>Sallee.</hi> This Gentleman, (meaning the <hi>Italian)</hi> took it upon him to acquaint you with the unhappy Accident; but, added he, I believe it is not poſſible to regain her. The Ambaſſador was ſo good as to offer his Aſſiſtance, in what lay in his Power. I begg'd he would be pleas'd to lend me a Boat, with ſome Hands to work her. He very willingly granted my Requeſt; and told me, he would lend me the Ship, but he fear'd it might occaſion a more publick Quarrel.</p>
            <p>He lent me ten Hands, four Patareros, and ſufficient ſmall Arms, with every thing that was neceſſary. My kind <hi>Italian</hi> would accompany me, and the reſt of the Company went Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. We ſpent but little time in fitting out;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0388100100:142"/>
and the Wind proving favourable, we ſet Sail, and made very good Way. The <hi>Saick</hi> had not purſu'd her Voyage above five Hours before us, ſo that we had hopes of getting up with 'em. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd my Companions, who labour'd inceſſantly. We ſail'd and row'd all Night, and when the Morning dawn'd, we gain'd Sight of a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, which we did not doubt was that we ſought for. We labour'd hard to come up with her, and gain'd upon her every Moment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eight a-clock we came a long ſide of her, and I ſoon diſcover'd <hi>Muſtapha</hi> giving Orders about the Engagement. I drew out a pair of Piſtols, and ſhot him dead. The reſt fir'd upon us, but notwithſtanding all their Oppoſition, I jump'd into their Veſſel, follow'd by the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and five more of the Men: And tho' they were ſuperior in Number, yet we ſoon made 'em ask for Quarter. I upon the Inſtant enquir'd for her that was always in my Thoughts; but, to my great Grief, was inform'd by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Slave at the Oar, that ſhe was taken on board of a Galley by Captain <hi>Hamet,</hi> our <hi>Iriſh</hi> Renegado; and they aſſured me, it was impoſſible for 'em to be overtaken. Unſpeakable was the Sorrow I felt, at this Relation; and all the Satisfaction I felt was, that I had rewarded <hi>Muſtapha</hi> for his Treachery. We ſteer'd our Courſe back, but I was more dead than alive in the Voyage.</p>
            <p>When we came on Board, the Ambaſſador con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol'd with me for my Misfortune, and entreated me to take Comfort. I told him Death was now my only Comfort, and I hop'd he was not far off.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Italian</hi> had agreed for his Paſſage on board a Veſſel in the Bay, bound for <hi>Rome:</hi> He begg'd that I would accompany him into <hi>Italy;</hi> and when he had ſettled his Affairs, he would (if it lay in his Power) come back to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0388100100:143"/>
               <hi>Sallee,</hi> and do his Endeavour to find what was become of Mrs. <hi>Villars.</hi> I thank'd him for his Offer, and told him I would accept of it. I had Effects enough, having all the Money and Jewels we brought from <hi>Hamet</hi>'s Country-Houſe. We took leave of the Ambaſſador, and gave him abundance of Thanks for his Civilities, and went on board the Veſſel that waited for us; we ſet Sail immediately, and in two Months ſafely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Rome;</hi> where our <hi>Italian</hi> did not care to go publickly on Shore, but ſtay'd till the Darkneſs of the Night favour'd our Landing.</p>
            <p>We had all our Goods diſembark'd, and took a Private Lodging in an obſcure Part of the City, where we were ſure of being conceal'd. We ask'd our Landlord, (who was a <hi>Frenchman)</hi> about the News of the Place. He told us a great deal of idle ſtuff, which ſignify'd nothing to us; at laſt, by the Advice of the <hi>Italian,</hi> I enquir'd of him, if <hi>Hernando Alvares</hi> were in Town, or no? He anſwer'd me, that he had been dead above two Months, and had left a noble Eſtate behind him. I ask'd him if he had not left a Wife to poſſeſs it. No, ſaid he.</p>
            <p>About three Years ago (continu'd our Landlord) he was to have been marry'd to a beautiful young Lady, an Heireſs to a vaſt Fortune; but his Brother ſtept in between, and gain'd her Affection. Some ſay they were marry'd, and others not; but ſhe was deliver'd of a fine Boy. Don <hi>Hernando</hi> took a barbarous Revenge of his Brother, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: He brib'd a Captain of a Veſſel to put a Weight about his Neck, and drown him in the Sea. But to make amends for this inhuman Act, he has left his vaſt Eſtate to the Son his Brother had by the Lady, and has choſen his Holineſs the <hi>Pope</hi> for his Guardian. Pray, ſaid I, what's become of the young Lady? He anſwer'd me he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0388100100:144"/>
could not tell; but it is ſuppos'd ſhe was gone into a Nunnery.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italian,</hi> while our Diſcourſe laſted, had turn'd his Face to the Window, that we might not perceive the Diſorder of his Countenance. Aſſoon as our Landlord was gone, he turn'd to me, and embrac'd me; ſaid he, My dear Friend, let what will happen to me, I ſhall have it in my Power to ſerve you with my Fortune; and ſo much I think my ſelf obliged to you, that if half will buy your Miſtreſs's Liberty, you ſhall command it. I return'd him the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments his kind Proffer deſerv'd, but told him, I could not expect to be ſo happy. He bid me not deſpair. I begg'd he would not mention any thing of my Affairs, till his own came to a lucky Iſſue.</p>
            <p>The next Day, we procur'd our ſelves Habits after the Mode of <hi>Rome,</hi> and reſolv'd to go to <hi>Grimaldi</hi>'s Country-Houſe, to hear, if it were poſſible, ſome Tidings of <hi>Iſabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antonio</hi> had dreſt himſelf in a mean Habit, and appear'd as my Servant. It being but ſix pleaſant Miles, we had reſolv'd to walk it. We enter'd a Village within half a Mile of the Place, and reſolv'd to dine at a poor Inn, there to gain ſome Intelligence. I went for a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, and Don <hi>Antonio</hi> paſs'd (as I ſaid) for my Servant, and Interpreter, and inform'd me of the Diſcourſe that paſt between 'em. That Gentleman, (meaning me) ſays he to our Hoſt, has ſome Buſineſs to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to Don <hi>Antonio Grimaldi,</hi> (for we knew of his being there). Our Innkeeper told us, it would be a difficult Matter to talk to him about Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs now, for he was that very Evening going to ſet out with his Daughter, in order to put her into a Nunnery at <hi>Naples;</hi> for all his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions (added he) cannot prevail upon her,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0388100100:145"/>
but ſhe is fixt unalterably in her Reſolution: This News, you may be ſure, haſten'd our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; but we did not well know how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the Secret we had to unfold.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> as not doubting <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, was fearful leſt an abrupt Diſcovery ſhould have ſome ſtrange Effect upon her: We therefore reſolv'd, that I ſhould firſt appear and break the Matter by degrees; for he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me that ſhe ſpoke <hi>French</hi> very well. When we approach'd the Houſe, <hi>Antonio</hi> ſtood at ſome Diſtance, while I went up to the Door alone. The Porter and I not underſtanding one another, I had like to have return'd as wiſe as I came. But at laſt a Servant in the Family happening to underſtand <hi>French,</hi> came and ended our ſputt'ring at one another. I inform'd him I had a Secret of the greateſt Importance to declare to <hi>Donna Iſabella.</hi> He told me he would acquaint his Lord with it. The Servant went in, and immediately return'd with a grave old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that ſeem'd to have been weeping. He ask'd me in <hi>French</hi> what I had to ſay to his Daughter, for ſhe did not care to ſpeak to any one. I begg'd that I might be brought to her Preſence, and did not doubt but that I had ſomething to ſay to her which would not diſpleaſe her. Don <hi>Antonio Grimaldi</hi> gravely ſmill'd, and ſhook his Head; No, no, Sir, ſaid he; you have nothing to give either her or me Comfort, unleſs you could revive the Dead. I anſwered him, he did not know what I could do. But I told him, the longer he delay'd my ſeeing her, the longer he deferr'd their own Happineſs. Well, ſaid he, I have no Hopes; but you ſhall ſee my Daughter, to convince you that nothing in this World can make us Happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0388100100:146"/>
He led me through ſeveral ſtately Apartments all hung with Black. And though it was high Noon, yet the Sun's Light was excluded, and dim twinkling Lamps uſurp'd his Room. At laſt we enter'd a Chamber, where ſat the fair Forlorn. I ſtop'd a Moment to behold her, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a fixt Melancholy on her Countenance, Beauty triumph'd there. She was careſſing an Infant ſhe had in her Arms. The Father enter'd firſt, and told her in <hi>French,</hi> that a Gentleman of <hi>France</hi> had a Secret to communicate to her, that would baniſh her Melancholy. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (return'd the Lady) may promiſe Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, but rather than expoſe him, I would beg him not to open his Mouth upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Madam, ſaid I, I own my ſelf a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but I pretend to cure the Mind as well as the Body; and to acquaint you with what you know already, you mourn the Loſs of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that you imagine was drown'd at Sea: But I can aſſure you he eſcap'd that Danger, and is now a Captive in <hi>Barbary,</hi> pining under the ſevereſt Want; and all the Hope he has of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is through your Means.</p>
            <p>The Lady upon this look'd wiſhfully upon her Father, and ſaid, Dear Father, don't endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deceive me any longer; you know I have your Promiſe, and my Time's expir'd. My dear Child, I am amaz'd as much as you can be, return'd the Father; for by all that's Holy, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw this Gentleman in my Life before, and am ſo far from believing him, that (begging his Pardon) I fancy there muſt be ſome very great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in't. Upon this I related to them all his Story, from the beginning, to our meeting in <hi>Barbary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I found my Relation had ſtagger'd her Faith a little, for a pleaſing Hope, rectify'd by power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0388100100:147"/>
Fear, roſe in her beautiful Face; and ſhe threw her ſelf at my Feet, notwithſtanding all my Endeavours to the contrary. Dear Sir, ſaid ſhe, do not ſhow me this light of Comfort, to put it out, and plunge me into eternal Darkneſs. Madam, ſaid I, by Heaven, and heavenly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I have ſeen him within theſe two Months, and what I have related to you, his own Mouth inform'd me; and having gain'd my Liberty, I made him a Promiſe to ſee his Friends in <hi>Italy,</hi> and inform them of his Condition. The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports and Ecſtaſies that took Poſſeſſion of both their Souls cannot be expreſs'd by Words; they embrac'd me, kiſs'd me, call'd me their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver. Unlook'd-for Happineſs! (ſaid <hi>Iſabella)</hi> Heaven, thou haſt heard my Prayers! and does my dear <hi>Antonio</hi> live! I'll immediately imbark for <hi>Barbary,</hi> and fetch him thence my ſelf: Even all that I am worth, my precious Boy ſhall ſell his Fortune too, to redeem his Father. O my young <hi>Antonio,</hi> Heaven has reſtor'd thy Father from the Dead, (ſaid ſhe to her Child) and I hope we ſhall ſee him again. The pretty Innocent mingled his Tears of Joy with theirs. After their firſt Tranſports were over, they again embrac'd me, and begg'd I would put 'em in a way to pay me the Obligations they ow'd me. Then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to enquire which way they muſt go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to accompliſh his Liberty. I told 'em, I had a Servant waiting without, that I intended ſhould accompany the Perſons they would ſend to manage the Affair. They ſeem'd to reproach me for letting him wait without, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſending for him in. I begg'd they would give me leave to go for him my ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was a Foreigner, and they would find it a hard matter to make him underſtand them. Upon this I ran out, and call'd to <hi>Antonio,</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0388100100:148"/>
told him in few Words how things ſtood. He follow'd me cloſe at the Heels: I went into the Room firſt, and as <hi>Antonio Grimaldi</hi> was giving him his Hand to lead him in, he fell upon his Knees before him. <hi>Iſabella</hi> caſting her Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, gave a Shriek, and cry'd out, 'Tis he! 'tis he himſelf! my dear <hi>Antonio!</hi> Joy took away her Speech, and ſhe fell down in a Trance. He ran and caught her in his Arms, kiſs'd and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd her, and at laſt brought her to herſelf. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination muſt make up the Diſcourſe between 'em. He told her at laſt, when Words of Senſe took Place, that he was obliged to me for his Liberty; for he had ſent ſeveral Letters to his Siſters, but never could get any Anſwer. They inform'd him, that both his Siſters were gone to reſide at <hi>Venice</hi> with their Husbands, and that was the Reaſon his Letters never came to their Hands. Now, ſaid <hi>Antonio,</hi> if my Friend (meaning me) was but happy, it would compleat my Joy. But to find a Wife, a Son, and Father kind, when I had many Reaſons to think the contrary, muſt have ſome Alloy, or it would not be poſſible for me to bear it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antonio</hi> upon this related my unhappy Story, and they all lamented my hard Fortune. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards enquir'd of his dear <hi>Iſabella</hi> concerning her own Sufferings. Which ſhe readily began.</p>
            <p>Said ſhe, that Day you left me, the Troubles of my Mind wrought ſo much upon my Body, that the Phyſicians declar'd I was in a violent Fever, and advis'd my Father to ſend me into the Country, which he accordingly did the next Day. The Thoughts of being ſo far from my dear <hi>Antonio</hi> encreas'd my Malady, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had little Hopes of my Life. My Fever, after having brought me to the brink of the Grave, left me: And my Father imagining it was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0388100100:149"/>
the approaching Marriage had wrought this ſudden Illneſs, told me one Day, that if it was that which lay ſo heavy upon my Spirits, he would remove it, by giving me the Power of refuſing to be the Wife of <hi>Hernando Alvarez.</hi> I thank'd him, and told him he had taken the only way to reſtore my Health; and that if I was forc'd to wed him, I ſhould be for ever miſerable. He was the tendereſt of Fathers, and inform'd me he would never force my Inclinations. The Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs my Father ſhew'd me work'd ſo much upon me, that I began to recover.</p>
            <p>Your Brother us'd often to viſit me in my Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which retarded my Health. My Father ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would never be in my Power to like him, very frankly told him ſo, and begg'd that he would diſcontinue his Viſits; for he was reſolv'd his Daughter ſhould never give her Hand, where it was not in her Power to give her Heart. They parted with many Words between them, but my Father perſiſted in his Reſolution.</p>
            <p>I began to diſcover that I was with Child, and a new Sort of an Illneſs ſeiz'd me. I knew this was an Accident that could not long be conceal'd, therefore I reſolv'd to let you know my Condition; and I gain'd my Woman, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Promiſes of a Reward, to deliver a Letter to you: But ſhe betray'd me to your Brother, which I ſuſpected from her not appearing. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declar'd the Truth to my indulgent Father. He was very much enrag'd at the Diſcovery; but paternal Love prevailing over his Paſſion, he forgave me, and promis'd to make me happy with my dear <hi>Antonio.</hi> Theſe Promiſes made my Sickneſs vaniſh, and I had no other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe but what attends breeding Women. My Father went to <hi>Rome</hi> to enquire for <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,</hi> but could not get the leaſt Information
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0388100100:150"/>
of him. This gave me a new Shock. But what bitter Agonies did I feel, when I receiv'd a Letter from your Brother, with a Copy of that I had written to you enclos'd; which was as follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

            <p>The Reading of this Letter ſunk me down, and I call'd for Death, as my laſt and only Hope. I reſolv'd to refuſe all Food, and had ſtarv'd my ſelf to Death, if a good Prieſt had not convinc'd me by his Arguments my Soul was in Danger, and I ſhould be guilty of a double Murder, my ſelf, and Infant. I lingred on in a reſtleſs State of Unhappineſs, till the Time of my Delivery came, which I pray'd to Heaven to end with my Life: But it pleas'd the Almighty Power to ſpare me to be happy.</p>
            <p>The Sight of my precious Infant call'd to Mind the Loſs of his Father; but I reſolv'd to baniſh all Thoughts of Death, that I might take Care of his tender Years. But I begg'd my Father to give me leave to go into a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery. With much Importunity he granted my Requeſt, on this Condition, that if I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Mind at the End of two Years, I might do as I thought fit. Tho' I thought the Time an Age, yet I unwillingly conſented.</p>
            <p>My Father us'd Means with the <hi>Pope,</hi> to have your Brother call'd to an Account for
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0388100100:151"/>
your Death; and it had gone hard with him, if we could have procur'd any Witneſſes; but for Want of that he was acquitted. In a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le time a heavy and deep Melancholy ſeiz'd him; and he profeſs'd ſo ſincere a Repentance, that even I almoſt forgave him. He begg'd he might ſee the Child; which my Father made me comply with. He ſhed ſuch abundance of Tears over it, that my Father wept for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and ſpoke ſo tenderly of the Loſs of his Brother, that wip'd off all Suſpicions of his Repentance. Since thou haſt loſt a Father, ſaid he, through my Barbarity, it is but juſt that I ſhould prove a Father to thee. He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently came to ſee him, though I could never be prevail'd upon to accept of a Viſit. At laſt his Grief ſeiz'd him ſo violently, that he was given over by his Phyſicians. When he was upon his Death-Bed, he made his Will, and bequeath'd my little <hi>Antonio</hi> his whole Eſtate; leaving the Pope his Guardian. He dy'd full of Repentance for his Crime, and no doubt his Soul took her Flight to Heaven.</p>
            <p>The generous <hi>Antonio</hi> could not refuſe ſome Tears to the Memory of his repentant Brother; but Joy ſucceeded Sorrow. The <hi>Pope</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Story, who ſent to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate their happy Meeting. Nothing but Mirth and Pleaſure ran through the <hi>Villa;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd my Sorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Antonio</hi> told me one Day, that he did not think he had a Right to rejoice without me; and now, ſaid he, I have nothing to afflict me but what you feel, therefore will bend my Thoughts if it be poſſible to relieve your Grief. I can procure a Fryar of my Acquaintance to go to <hi>Sallee,</hi> one that knows the Nature of the Buſineſs we ſhall ſend him about, being he has
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0388100100:152"/>
often gone to redeem Captives: We'll ſend for him, and you may give him what Inſtructions you think fit. I thank'd him, and was very ſorry for the Trouble I ſhould give him, but was reſolv'd to accompany him my ſelf. He told me he would not have me go by any means, for I could be of no manner of Uſe in the Affair, but rather a Hindrance; and if I ſhould be once diſcovered, might fall into the ſame State we both lately eſcap'd from; and perhaps meet with much worſe Uſage than I had before. His Advice was ſo reaſonable, that I reſolv'd to take it, whatever Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence I did my ſelf. The Fryar was ſent for, bad his Commiſſion and Inſtructions given him, and withal to ſpare no Coſt. <hi>Antonio</hi> told him whatever he gave ſhould not be thought unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
            <p>He was to have a thouſand Crowns for his Expences, and two thouſand more if he ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>The Fryar undertook his Voyage with a great deal of Alacrity, and gave us great Hopes of his Succeſs by his Willingneſs; and he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd the next Day for <hi>Genoa,</hi> that Port be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the propereſt Place to get a Veſſel for <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary.</hi> We wiſh'd him a good Voyage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him to Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Antonio</hi> did all he could to divert my Melancholy: We often went a hunting, ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fiſhing, and viſiting the Ladies. In ſhort, he made me partake in all the Diverſions <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> could afford. But though I ſeem'd often to be diverted, yet I had always my Condition too much at Heart to be merry. We view'd all the Rarities and Antiquities of ancient and modern <hi>Rome.</hi> I muſt confeſs, theſe Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lull'd my Sorrows often, but when I had Time for Reflection they ruſh'd upon me with the greater Force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0388100100:153"/>
I ſhall not trouble my Reader in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Places treated on by Pens far above my weak Capacity; but only give a ſhort Deſcription of <hi>Naples,</hi> whither <hi>Don Antonio</hi> would have me go. I was not much averſe to the Journey, though a pretty long one; and we ſet out with a very handſom Equipage. <hi>Donna Iſabella,</hi> with her little Son, accompany'd us; but <hi>Don Antonio Grimaldi</hi> was oblig'd to attend the <hi>Pope,</hi> to ſettle the Affairs of his Son-in-law's Eſtate. I was oblig'd to appear chearful, if it was but in Complaiſance to <hi>Don Antonio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We arriv'd at <hi>Naples</hi> in three Days, without meeting any thing extraordinary upon the Road. Certainly, never any City in the World can boaſt a finer Situation: Add to that, their Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are ſumptuous, every private Houſe ſeems a Palace, and every Palace looks like the Court of a King: The Streets ſpacious; a mild Air and free from Tempeſts; ſtrong, both by Art and Nature. In ſhort, if I was obliged to live out of my native Country, (which every Man is fond of) <hi>Naples</hi> ſhould be the only Place. It has a Wall kept in very good Repair, with three Caſtles almoſt impregnable. The chief is ſeated on Mount <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> ſo call'd from a Chappel dedicated to him: But if it is <hi>Eraſmus Roterda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> I can't imagine how the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> came to have ſuch a particular Regard for him, when it is very well known he was no great Friend to them; at leaſt he was a Scourge to their Abſurdities in his Writings.</p>
            <p>This is not only a Safeguard to the City and adjacent Country, but might prove its Scourge. In 1587 it was blown up by Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, penetrating to the Powder Room, which mightily damag'd the whole City. The ſecond
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0388100100:154"/>
is <hi>Caſtello nuevo,</hi> or the new Caſtle, built by <hi>Charles,</hi> King of <hi>Naples.</hi> This Caſtle commands the Haven, and is generally the Viceroy's Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The third ſtands on the South-eaſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the City, built upon a little Rock, join'd to the Continent by <hi>Lucullus</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> and is ſometimes call'd by his Name, but oftner <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtello del Ovo,</hi> or the Caſtle of the Egg, from its Form. They have alſo a fine Arſenal for their Gallies, very well kept, and furniſh'd with great Store of Ammunition. But I think the Mole the moſt extraordinary Piece of Work, being it defends the Haven from the ſtormy South; lin'd of each Side, and pav'd on the Top with noble ſquare Stones, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a fine large Fountain of Marble; the whole Extent is five hundred Paces, and ten in Breadth. The Inhabitants often boaſt of the Antiquity of their City, founded twenty years after <hi>Troy</hi>'s Deſtruction, and call'd by the antient Poets <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenope,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> does ſufficiently teſtify in his <hi>Georgics,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Ille Virgilium me Tempore dulcis alebat</l>

            </p>
            <p>This City has ſuffer'd many Revolutions, but none more extraordinary than that in 1640, when a poor Fiſherman, without Shoes to his Feet, in five Days time commanded the whole Power of <hi>Naples;</hi> and might have liv'd in that Grandeur, if his Mind had chang'd with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted State; but he was ſtill a Fiſherman. His ſhort-liv'd Fire blaz'd too fierce to laſt, and he fell a Victim to the Rage he himſelf began.</p>
            <p>Their Churches are noble Structures, and beautify'd with Paintings by the beſt Hands. Their Women are moſt of 'em beautiful, but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0388100100:155"/>
my Heart had no Room to think of them.</p>
            <p>The City is govern'd by very wholeſom Laws, but one particular Article adds much to the Quiet of it; none are ſuffer'd to wear Swords but thoſe of the Garriſons; ſo if there's any Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in the Streets, a Bout at Fiſty-Cuffs generally ends the Diſpute: Tho' Bravo's are to be hir'd to do a Murder here as cheap as at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Men of Honour too; for we heard of a Quarrel between two <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, where one, according to Cuſtom, hir'd a Bravo to murder the other, and gave him his Reward beforehand. But it ſo fell out, that ſome Friends to both Parties reconcil'd the two Gentlemen. The Perſon that had bargain'd with the Bravo for the Job, ſent to him, and told him of their Reconcilement, but that he might keep the Money. The other told him it was not in his Power to return it him, but he was above receiving Money without doing his Work, and therefore the Gentleman muſt of neceſſity ſuffer Death. He intreated him, and us'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arguments, but all to no purpoſe. When he found nothing would prevail, he told him he would immediately acquaint the Gentleman with his Deſign, which he did accordingly. Notwithſtanding, the Bravo the ſame Evening found his Opportunity, and left the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman for dead upon the <hi>Mole;</hi> tho' he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd after a lingring Illneſs. But the Bravo had the Impudence to go to the other (when he found the Gentleman was in a fair way of Recovery) and told him he begg'd his Pardon that he had not been as good as his Word, but he would take Care and mend his Hand very quickly. In ſhort, he was found ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in the Matter, that the Gentleman was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to hire another of the ſame Trade to give
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0388100100:156"/>
him a Caſt of his Office, and diſpatch the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo before he could execute what was deſign'd; and the next Day he was found dead at the very Door of the Gentleman's Houſe he had intended to aſſaſſinate; waiting, as it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, for an Opportunity to do his Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>After we had view'd every thing within the City, we went to ſee the much fam'd-<hi>Veſuvius,</hi> or the burning Mountain, a League and a half Eaſt of the City. The <hi>Neapolitans</hi> call it the Bed-chamber of the Sun, becauſe he appears to them firſt from the Top of that Mountain. Round the Bottom of it is the richeſt Spot of Ground in the Univerſe, I'll not except even the Mines of <hi>Potoſi;</hi> for the yearly Vintage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces twelve hundred thouſand Ducats. The Middle of the Hill is very pleaſantly ſhaded with Cheſnut, and ſeveral other Fruit Trees. The Mountain has a double Top; that to the North terminates in a Plain finely cultivated: The other towards the South, which is the <hi>Volcano,</hi> riſes much higher.</p>
            <p>When we had gain'd the Summit, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended gradually into its Bowels, by large Steps cut on purpoſe. It has, in Times paſt, done much Damage to the Country round it, by its ſudden Eruptions; but now it forebodes nothing but Rain, when the Top is envelop'd with Clouds.</p>
            <p>When we had ſufficiently ſatisfy'd our Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities at <hi>Naples,</hi> we took a Tour to <hi>Putzol,</hi> or <hi>Poſuolo,</hi> through a Hollow of a Rock, a Mile in Length, and no other Light but what came in at both Ends, and one in the Middle from the Top of the Rock. This ſubterraneous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is pav'd with Stone all through, and the narroweſt Part of it is ten Yards over. About the Middle is a ſmall Chappel dedicated to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0388100100:157"/>
               <hi>Mary.</hi> We viſited all the Rarities of the Place, particularly <hi>Virgil's</hi> Tomb, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cover'd with Ivy. They told me of a Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel Tree that ſprouted naturally out of it, but (not to take from that incomparable Man, whoſe Works are ever-living Laurels) I could not ſee any ſuch thing. We alſo view'd the Lake <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano,</hi> ſo call'd from the multitude of Serpents or Snakes that fall into it from the pendent Mountains. The Water is of two different Qualities; that taſted upon the Surface is ſweet or freſh, but that taken deeper is of a brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Taſte, ſuppos'd from ſome Minerals that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron it.</p>
            <p>On the South Side of the Lake ſtands a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Stove, which is call'd St. <hi>German's Stove;</hi> but we had not Curioſity enough to enter it, nor Faith enough to believe a ridiculous Fable that is told concerning it, (tho' it is reported a Saint declar'd it for a Truth) which I ſhall put down here, and leave my Reader to judge of it himſelf. St. <hi>German</hi> was advis'd to repair to this Stove, to cure him of a dangerous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady: When he came there, he found the Soul of a very pious Man that he knew, tormented with the Heat of the Place. St. <hi>German,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Language of Souls, ask'd him how ſo good a Man as he was in his Life-time, came to be condemn'd to ſuch a ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Soul very civilly anſwer'd him, that it was for ſiding with <hi>Laurentius,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd <hi>Symacus</hi> in the Popedom; but he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that his Prayers would fetch him out of that Hot-houſe. St. <hi>German</hi> pray'd heartily, you may be ſure, and got the Soul of the Man from out thence; but where it went after, no one could tell. But the Place was call'd ever after St. <hi>German's Stove.</hi>

To the Eaſt of the bordering Mountain is a Place they call the Cave of Death; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Thing of Life ventures to the farther End, they ſay immediately drops down dead: Tho' a Perſon that liv'd in a neighbouring Village ventur'd in often for a Reward. When he came out again he was all of a Sweat, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to ſtand for five or ſix Minutes. When he had recover'd himſelf, he took a Dog out of a Bag he had brought with him, and by the means of a wooden Inſtrument made for that Purpoſe, thruſt him in to the very End, and drew him out dead to all Appearance. When he had remain'd ſome time for us to view him, he took him up by the fore Legs, and threw him into the Lake <hi>Agnano;</hi> where he recover'd immediately, ſwam out, and ran away from us. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> told me it was a hard matter to get a Dog there; for aſſoon as ever they ſaw a Stranger, they would run away into the Woods, and ſneak home again when they were gone; which was the Reaſon the Perſon that went in, always ſecures one for the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>A Mile farther we went to the Court of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can;</hi> a Place unpleaſant enough, continually ſmoaking, and ſuch hot Vapours ariſe from the Pores of the Earth that it almoſt overcame me. In ſome Places Water bubbles out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities; and if we threw a Stone into it, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded back as if you had ſtruck it againſt a Pavement. But the Place is reckon'd to cure a great many Diſtempers; eſpecially to make Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men pregnant, and to cure Diſeaſes of the Head and Eyes. <hi>Donna Iſabella</hi> was carry'd over it in a Sedan; but I believe ſhe did not want it upon the ſcore of Barrenneſs, as you may underſtand in her Story.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0388100100:159"/>
We ſpent ſix Weeks in this not unpleaſing Entertainment, and <hi>Don Antonio</hi> being pretty well ſatiated as well as my ſelf, we went back again to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now my Melancholy gain'd ſuch Ground upon me, that it was not in the Power of Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation to hide it. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> and all the Family expreſs'd a great deal of Trouble for my Sorrow; and I am well aſſur'd there was not any thing in their Power they would have refus'd, to have given me Quiet: But the Mind's Diſeaſe baffles the Phyſician's Art. At laſt a Letter arriv'd from the Fryar, which gave us no other Account, but that he was ſafe return'd to <hi>Genoa,</hi> and intended to embark for <hi>Rome</hi> in a few Days. This lame Account quite diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd me, for now we had not the leaſt Hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we all agreed if he had ſucceeded he would have been forward enough to have acquainted us with it. The Knowledge of this caſt me quite down, and my Body was forc'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Troubles of my Mind. A ſtrong Fever ſeiz'd me, and brought me to the Brink of the Grave: And tho' I wiſh'd for Death, yet, like common Friends, he fled from me in my Neeeſſity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Antonio</hi> and his Lady ſeldom went from my Bed-ſide, and had I been a Brother to 'em they could not have regarded me more. But Nature, in ſpight of my Misfortunes, prevail'd; and I gather'd Strength even againſt my Will. They had inform'd me in my Illneſs (by my Importunity) of the Fryar's Arrival, and that he had not ſucceeded in his Negotiation: But yet they had not told me all the Particulars. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd the Fryar might be ſent for, and conceal nothing from me of what had paſt. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he came, and gave me the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0388100100:160"/>
Sir, ſaid he in <hi>French,</hi> aſſoon as I arriv'd at <hi>Sallee,</hi> I met with <hi>Hamet</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. He receiv'd me at firſt after a bruitiſh manner, but when I declar'd I came to pay him his Demand for one of his Slaves that had made his Eſcape, he began to be leſs ſour in his Treatment. He ſaid a great many handſom things concerning <hi>Don Antonio;</hi> but when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to mention you, he fell into a violent Rage, and vented bitter Reproaches againſt you; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you were a vile Impoſtor, had baſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and robb'd him doubly, of his Miſtreſs and his Money. I told him I came to ranſom the Lady, and pay for whatever Damages you had done. As for the Lady, ſaid he, ſhe's Food for Fiſhes long ago; for rather than ſhe would ſubmit to me, ſhe threw her ſelf overboard, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had gain'd the Port, when I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her out of a <hi>Saick</hi> one of my Slaves had brought her in from <hi>Mammora)</hi> and, in ſpight of our Endeavours to the contrary, ſunk for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Bottom. And is ſhe gone! ſaid I: O Proof of virtuous Love! Happy had I been to have embrac'd the ſame Fate!</p>
            <p>The Relation of this killing Diſaſter took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my Senſes for ſome time; but when I had recover'd, he went on. I had ſome Hope at firſt that this was only a Fiction of his own; but I found in the Town that it was no Secret, and every body declar'd that it was Truth. A Jew confirm'd me in't, whom you had bought ſeveral Things of for your Voyage. He told me that <hi>Hamet</hi> arriv'd without any Woman with him, for he ſaw him land in a very ill Humour, and had complain'd of him for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, to his Superiour at <hi>Mequinez,</hi> and he receiv'd a ſufficient Check from him. I was too well convinc'd of the Truth, and therefore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0388100100:161"/>
haſten'd my Departure, and am very ſorry I could not ſucceed; but it was not in Fate, and I hope you will calmly ſubmit to the Will of Heaven, who ſends theſe Afflictions for Tryals.</p>
            <p>The good Friar gave me a great many whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Admonitions: But I was not in a State much to obſerve 'em. I now began to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the World, becauſe there was nothing in't (ſince the Death of my dear Wife) worth my Notice. I had no Thoughts of returning to <hi>England,</hi> tho' I had Opportunities enough; but took a Reſolution of going to ſome remote Part of the World; imagining, the farther I was from my native Country, I ſhould be the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remov'd from my Anxiety. But alas! Sorrow is too conſtant a Companion, and there's no parting with it, but by Death.</p>
            <p>I begg'd Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> if he heard of any Ship bound for a long Voyage, he would acquaint me with it, which he promis'd me to do, (after finding Perſuaſion had no Effect on me.) Two Months paſs'd away, and no news of a Ship; when I began to be very uneaſy, and told <hi>Antonio,</hi> I would e'en make a Voyage to <hi>Genoa,</hi> where I could not well ſail of a Veſſel. When he found nothing could ſtay me, he ask'd me to what Part of the World I would chuſe to go? I told him I did not much care where. Why then, ſaid he, if you pleaſe, my Father, and I will fit you out a Ship of what Burden you think fit, either for War or Traffick. I thank'd him, and told him I would have it for both, if he pleas'd, and I would be their <hi>Supra-Cargo,</hi> if they thought fit to give me ſo great a Truſt. In ſhort, a Ship of two hundred and fifty Ton was bought of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant at <hi>Naples;</hi> a ſtout new Veſſel, that mounted ſix and twenty Braſs Guns, and we mann'd her with a hundred Hands, moſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0388100100:162"/>
               <hi>Engliſh;</hi> who underſtanding I intended for the South Sea, were glad of the Opportunity. Don <hi>Antonio</hi> took care to provide every thing neceſſary for Traffick; and I was made Captain, and <hi>Supra-Cargo.</hi> I told him, I hop'd I ſhould in a few Years bring him a good Account of his Lading. He obligingly anſwer'd me, that he hop'd I would come Home reconcil'd to my ſelf, and he ſhould think himſelf very happy. The worſt of it was, we had no Commiſſion, neither would I ſuffer <hi>Antonio</hi> to procure me one: For we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, like <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> to fight only with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of our Country.</p>
            <p>I chriſten'd my Ship the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> out of Reſpect to <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Lady, and hoiſted <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours on Board. When the Day came I was to go on Board, there were Tears ſhed on both Sides. I could not, without ſome Regret, part with ſo good a Friend as <hi>Antonio</hi> had prov'd to me; and I am very well convinc'd that they were as ſincere in their Sorrow,</p>
            <p>We ſet Sail from <hi>Oſtia,</hi> (where our Ship lay ever ſince ſhe came from <hi>Naples)</hi> the ſecond of <hi>March</hi> 1693, with Intention to ſteer our neareſt Courſe for <hi>America.</hi> Our Ship prov'd an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sailor; and we made the <hi>Streights</hi> Mouth in twelve Days from our firſt Departure. When I beheld the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> it brought freſh to my Memory paſt Tranſactions; and I long'd for an Opportunity to be reveng'd on the <hi>Moors.</hi> The next Day our Men diſcover'd two Sail bearing down the Wind upon us. We thought our ſelves too well provided to run away; tho' we kept on our Courſe; and perceiving but one of 'em that follow'd us, I ask'd my Men if they were willing to ſpeak with that Veſſel, and they cry'd one and all, they would with all their Hearts. We prepar'd for an Engagement with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0388100100:163"/>
all the Expedition imaginable, for fear ſhe might prove of <hi>Barbary.</hi> We hoiſted our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and they did the ſame. When we found that, we lay by, that we might be inform'd of the News in <hi>England.</hi> But aſſoon as ever they came a-long Side of us, they pluck'd down their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours, and hoiſted thoſe of <hi>Morocco</hi> in their Room; calling to us to ſurrender that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, or it ſhould be worſe for us. We were a little ſurpriz'd at firſt in being diſappointed; but notwithſtanding this, my Men deſir'd I would begin the Fight. We had not open'd our Ports yet, and I order'd my Men not to do it till I gave 'em the Word. I ſent a Man to buſy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about the Halliards of our Ancient, that the <hi>Rover</hi> might imagine we were going to ſtrike. We were well provided with ſmall Arms, and all manner of warlike Stores. I order'd every Man to their Poſts, but not to appear till they heard a Whiſtle; upon which they ſhould open their Ports, and fire both great Guns and ſmall Arms. The <hi>Rover</hi> thought us long in ſtriking our Colours; he therefore call'd out to us again, and told us if we did not ſtrike that Inſtant, they would pour a Broad-ſide into us. Juſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, I blew my Whiſtle; my Men obey'd my Orders punctually, they burſt open our Ports, thruſt out their Guns, and gave 'em a Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, with a Diſcharge of their ſmall Arms. This put 'em in much Confuſion, as not expecting any Oppoſition, and I am certain we kill'd a great many of their Men; for imagining we ſhould be their Prize without fighting, they had crouded upon Deck all their Hands.</p>
            <p>I had tack'd about, and given her another Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, before they return'd us the Favour. But they were not long backward, but pour'd in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us very faſt. My Men did their Buſineſs
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0388100100:164"/>
very well, and the Fight continu'd half an Hour with the utmoſt Fury. I began to fancy we ſhould have but dry Meat (as the Sailors ſay) and looking upon their Quarter-Deck, I ſoon ſpy'd the Renegado <hi>Hamet</hi> giving Directions. At the Sight of him I was both ſurpriz'd, and pleas'd; but my Soul was fill'd with an unuſual Fury. We were ſo near, that I could hear every Word he ſaid, tho' I could not underſtand him, becauſe he ſpoke in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Tongue. As we were tacking about, and charging again, I ſhew'd my ſelf to him: I told him he was the only Man in the World that I hated; and that very Day he ſhould be in my Power, or I in his, or Death ſhould put an End to both our Lives. He ſeem'd ſurpriz'd, but gave me a great deal of abuſive Language. I encourag'd my Men, and deſir'd 'em to fight bravely; for if we fell into their Hands, we ſhould have no Mercy. I had fir'd my Piece at Random before, that is, at the firſt Perſon I ſaw; but now I levell'd all at <hi>Hamet,</hi> and he the ſame at me. At laſt I had the good Fortune to fetch him down. At this Sight I could not forbear giving a Shout of Joy, which ſo affected thoſe that were near me, and underſtood the Buſineſs, that they fought like ſo many Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and after an obſtinate Fight of two Hours, they ſtruck to us. We gave God Thanks for our Victory; and I immediately went on Board 'em, where we had made a terrible Slaughter, they having loſt by their own Account ninety ſeven Men.</p>
            <p>I ask'd ſome of the Men, what Ship that was which ſtood aloof from the Engagement; and they inform'd me it was a Prize they had taken a few Days before, laden with Wine and other Commodities. I then thought of a Stratagem to get her into my Power. I order'd our Ship to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0388100100:165"/>
ſtrike her Colours, and then we hoiſted thoſe of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and took our Ship in Tow. When the Prize ſaw us in that Poſture, ſhe imagin'd the <hi>Moor</hi> had conquer'd, and made all the Sail ſhe could to come up with us; ſo that we ſoon came near enough to ſend our Long-Boat arm'd on Board her.</p>
            <p>There were but twelve <hi>Moors</hi> on Board, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Priſoners that were put under Hatches. When our Men had taken care of 'em, I went to 'em, and order'd the Priſoners to be releas'd, deſiring the Perſon that was the Maſter to come upon Deck. The <hi>Moors</hi> had not taken any of the Lading out of her. She was a Ship of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Tons bound for <hi>Leverpool,</hi> laden, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with Port-Wines, and ſeveral Jars of Oyl. I told the Maſter, he was at Liberty to purſue his Voyage when he thought fit. The poor Man was ſome time before he could believe what I ſaid to be real: But when he was convinc'd, he return'd me the Thanks ſuitable to the Preſent I had made him. Yet he would make me a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a couple of Hogſheads of Wine, two Jars of Oyl, and two of Raiſons; beſides ſix of each to the Ship's Crew. I had loſt ſeventeen of my Men in the Engagement, and eleven wounded; which I ſupply'd, by taking as many of the Slaves they had on board of <hi>Hamet</hi>'s Ship, all by their own Choice; and the reſt that did not care for ſo long a Voyage, I recommended to the Maſter of the Prize, who promis'd me to land 'em all in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We pillag'd the <hi>Corſair,</hi> and found very good Booty. We had out of her to the Value of two thouſand Pounds in Goods, which I enter'd in the Ship's Books for the Uſe of the Company. We did not know well how to diſpoſe of her Crew; and tho' they deſerv'd Death, yet in cool
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0388100100:166"/>
Blood I thought it was inhumane; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd they never had injur'd me. So I releas'd 'em by the Conſent of the whole Company, with this Agreement; that they ſhould make a Preſent from me to <hi>Mirza</hi> the Eunuch of fifty Pound in their <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Money, which he that had Command over the reſt ſwore by <hi>Mahomet</hi> to perform. When we had taken every thing that was needful for our Voyage out of her, we let her go, and purſu'd our Courſe.</p>
            <p>We touch'd at the <hi>Canaries</hi> (or Fortunate Iſlands) to take in Freſh Water, and turn'd the Lading we had taken out of the <hi>Corſair</hi> into Money: And I ſhar'd it among the Sailors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a fourth Part for my ſelf and Owners, as I call'd 'em. I gave the Men by Lotts leave to go a-ſhore, where they ſoon diſpos'd of their Money for things they wanted; but the chief of their Commerce was for Wine and Brandy, knowing we had a long Voyage to make.</p>
            <p>We were obliged to leave the Place ſooner than we deſign'd, by reaſon our Pilot had unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately kill'd a <hi>Portugueze,</hi> and the Governor threaten'd to have our Ship ſtopp'd if we did not ſurrender him up. I underſtood that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd had been in the Wrong, and therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than run the hazard of loſing him, we ſet Sail from thence the tenth of <hi>April.</hi> The Caſtle fir'd ſeveral Guns with Shot to ſtay us, but we did not regard it, but kept on our Voyage.</p>
            <p>We met with nothing worth Notice till we made the Iſland of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> one of the <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> and came to an Anchor in ten Fathom Water, in a fine gravelly Bottom.</p>
            <p>Theſe Iſlands are the <hi>Heſperides</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. The Natives are Blacks, a poor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble People. They brought us a few Tortoiſe, which we exchang'd any Traſh for, and they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0388100100:167"/>
were contented. The Rivulet of freſh Water would hardly ſupply us, it being almoſt dry'd up. But we had Wood enough. The whole Iſland is not above two Leagues and a half in Length, and half a one in Breadth; very barren of Fruit, Graſs, or Roots, and even Animals. I ſaw only a few wild Aſſes, and ſome Goats, which were too nimble for us, or ſo far off that they were not worth our waſting Powder and Shot.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> about two Leagues to the North, is a well-inhabited Iſland, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi> We reſolv'd to go and Anchor there; but the Wind proving fair, we purſu'd our Voyage, paſs'd by the Iſland <hi>del Fogo</hi> in the Night, and we could perceive the <hi>Volcano</hi> burning like the Flame of a Glaſs-houſe. Twenty Days afterwards we paſs'd the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Line, with the uſual Ceremony of duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe Perſons that had never been there before. But I bought off the beſt Part of the Delinquents for an Anchor of Brandy.</p>
            <p>The next Day we bury'd two of our Men, who dy'd of the Wounds they had receiv'd in the Fight; but all the reſt happily recover'd. We gave 'em three Guns, and committed 'em to the Waves.</p>
            <p>In the Latitude of twenty two, we ſaw a great Number of Fowls, and therefore judg'd we could not be many Leagues from Land, which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd ſoon after to be <hi>The Iſland of Aſcenſion,</hi> about two Leagues to the North; but we paſs'd by it, and in two Days more anchor'd in ſix Fathom Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the Iſland of St. <hi>Catharines,</hi> about half a Mile from the main Land of <hi>Braſil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Iſland lies in twenty ſeven Degrees thirty Minutes of South Latitude. It is almoſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd Grove of Trees, and but thinly inhabited by <hi>Portugueze,</hi> and a few Blacks. They are in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0388100100:168"/>
want almoſt of all the Neceſſaries of Life, beſides Proviſion, which is plentiful enough, ſuch as it is. The Inhabitants are courteous enough, and would not take Money for any thing we had of 'em, but Linnen and Woollen. And after I had got every thing that was neceſſary for the Ship, I ſold 'em Goods to the Value of four hundred Pounds, which I receiv'd in pure Gold. They never have Peace with the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; and being ſo very near, they have often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made Inroads, and carry'd off the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. But they have prevented ſuch Attempts for the future, by building ſeveral Redoubts, where they keep conſtant Guard.</p>
            <p>They pay no other Taxes but the Church-Tythes, (which they'll be ſure not to loſe;) and for Religion, they had but one Friar when I was there; and all his Buſineſs was, as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, only to receive his Tenths.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Frenchman</hi> told me a pleaſant Story of one of the Inhabitants, an induſtrious Fellow that had ten Children; but, notwithſtanding his Induſtry, found it a hard Matter to bring both Ends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the Year's End: Tho' the worſt of his Grievances was the Prieſt's Tythes, and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. He often endeavour'd to perſuade the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forget him a Year or two, but all to no Purpoſe. One Day the Father paid him a Viſit, in order to receive his Dues. The poor Man told him ingenuouſly he had it not in his Power to give it him. But he ſtill inſiſted. At laſt he told him he had but one Way to procure it, and that he fear'd the Church would not allow of. The Friar told him he was the beſt Judge of that, if he would tell him what it was. Why, ſaid the Man, a Perſon that lives on the Continent has ſeveral fat Pigs, of a very fine Breed. Now, ſaid he, I could bring one over with me unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0388100100:169"/>
of any one, as I come from my daily La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and ſuch a one (naming a Neighbour) will give me a good Price for it. The Friar paus'd ſome time, but at laſt gave him this Anſwer. It is certainly a Sin to ſteal, but yet it is a greater Sin to rob the Church of its Due, and therefore I will abſolve you. But bring the Pig to me, for if it's worth ſo much to your Neighbour, it is worth as much to me. The Man told him he would be ſure to bring it him that Night, and the Friar ſaid if he was not at Home, he would leave Word with his Servant to take Care of it. Now the Friar had no conſtant Dwelling here; for they are ſent from <hi>Lagoa,</hi> a Town upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, about ten Leagues to S. S. W. and their Tythes were uſually ſent there in a ſmall Bark kept for that Purpoſe. The Prieſt took care to be out of the way (that he might ſwear he knew nothing of the Matter, if it was found out) at the Time when the Man was to come with his Pig; but gave his Servant a ſtrict Order, whatever was brought ſhould be immediately carry'd on Board, and taken a great deal of Care of.</p>
            <p>When the Time came, the Man was as good as his Word, and brought to the Prieſt's Houſe his Promiſe in a Hand-basket. The Servant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd his Maſter's Orders, and went to carry it on Board; but before he could get to the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, what he had in his Basket began to cry out. The poor Fellow was very much fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find he had got a Child in the Basket; but fearing, by the Charge his Maſter gave of it, he was deeply concern'd in the Affair, made all the haſte he could on Board: And the Veſſel ſetting Sail that Night, he went with his Charge to <hi>Lagoa,</hi> where he very ſecretly delivered it to the Brotherhood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0388100100:170"/>
The Prieſt at St. <hi>Catharines</hi> thought his Man had robb'd him, and made his Eſcape, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was miſſing ſo long; for he had carry'd a great many other things on Board before the Child. The Imagination of this made the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very uneaſy; and the Wind continuing fair, he imbark'd on board a Veſſel, and arriv'd at <hi>Lagoa</hi> the Day after his Man. But what was his Surprize, when he found he had got a ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Child, inſtead of a ſucking Pig! He told the reſt of his Brethren the Affront that had been put upon him; and they reſolv'd to ſend the Bantling back again: but either for want of due Care, or through the Fatigue of the Sea, the Child dy'd. When the Friar came back to St. <hi>Catharines,</hi> he ran open-mouth'd to the poor Man, and ſwore he ſhould be excommunicated for playing Tricks with the Church. The Man told him, he was forward enough to have his Tythes; ſo having ten Children, and finding nine too many to keep, he was reſolv'd he ſhould have his Due, and have the Tenth. And farther added, if he offer'd to make any more Stir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, he would acquaint every body with his encouraging him to ſteal from his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>The Father finding the Man had too much Underſtanding to be Prieſt-ridden, thought it his beſt way to hold his Tongue. But the Secret was diſclos'd, and the poor Prieſt led a ſad ſort of Life: For whenever he came for his Tythes, many would merrily ask him if he would have his Tithe Pig. In ſhort, the Friar was ſham'd out of the Iſland, and the Fraternity were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſend another Man in his Room, who very often hears the Story of the Child, tho' much againſt his Will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0388100100:171"/>
We anchor'd at firſt within a Bow-ſhot of the <hi>Iſland of Parrots,</hi> in ſeven Fathom Water: But we were inform'd the beſt Place to water our Ship, was two Leagues beyond the Iſland of St. <hi>Catharine.</hi> We had our preſent Wants ſupply'd from the Continent, tho' not enough to water the Ship; ſo we reſolv'd to ſteer for the watering Place, in the Bay of <hi>Arazatiba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſteer'd between the Iſland and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and all the way on each ſide we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd a beautiful Proſpect of Houſes, inviron'd with natural Woods and Groves, which gave the Eye a vaſt Delight. When we approach'd the Bay of <hi>Arazatiba,</hi> we perceiv'd a Ship, with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours, with her Anchor a-peak, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to diſcover who we were. I immediately hoiſted <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours, but prepar'd for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, as imagining her to be <hi>French,</hi> (or ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pirate;) for there was War between the two Nations: But I found it was a Privateer, commanded by Captain <hi>Dampier,</hi> who made me a Viſit, after having hail'd us. When he was on Board, he us'd many Perſuaſions to engage me to conſort with him, and follow the Buſineſs of Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teering; but I told him, I had other Affairs to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. After I had treated him handſomely with what the Ship afforded, he took his Leave, and invited me to dine on board his Veſſel the next Day. I gave him my Promiſe to wait on him, and I accordingly went, where I was very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely treated; and there we agreed two Days after to make an Entertainment jointly for the Officers of both Ships on Shore; and the Day after that, for the reſt of the Crew.</p>
            <p>In order to this I commanded a large Tent to be pitch'd, capable of holding fifty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and we ſtrove who ſhould ſend the moſt Materials on ſhore for our Feaſt. We had the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0388100100:172"/>
Muſick of both Veſſels; but mine proving to be the beſt, as being <hi>Italians,</hi> gave the moſt Delight: not but they join'd in Conſort, and agreed very well.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, Captain <hi>Dampier</hi> told me, tho' he could not oblige me with <hi>Italian</hi> Muſick, yet he had an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eunuch that ſang admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; he added, he could not anſwer for his Judgment, but he was very well convinc'd he never heard a finer Voice in his Life. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was brought in; but my Readers may gueſs at my Surprize, when, in the Perſon of the Singer, I diſcover'd my Miſtreſs's Lawyer, whom my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and his Friend had equipt for a fine Singer. I knew him aſſoon as ever I ſaw him, but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by his Behaviour he had no Knowledge of me; neither was it very poſſible he could have known me, becauſe he had never ſeen me but once, and then he had too much Concern to make any Obſervations: But the Occaſion had imprinted in my Mind a lively Idea of him.</p>
            <p>He ſung admirably well, and with good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I ask'd the Captain how he came to be an Eunuch; he told me he could not inform me, neither could he ever prevail upon him to let him know it. We were very merry for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hours; and I may ſafely declare that during that Time I had bury'd my inward Malady.</p>
            <p>I told the Singer, I believ'd I could let Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Dampier</hi> into the Secret of his Caſtration, if he would not be offended at it. He ſeem'd very much concern'd, and bluſh'd; but imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I knew nothing of the Matter, he gave me his Conſent to ſay what I thought fit; yet with the utmoſt Chagrine in his Face, as believing he was only going to be the Jeſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0388100100:173"/>
But when I began to name my Maſter, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into ſome Part of the Story, I found him in the utmoſt Confuſion, inſomuch that I pity'd him, and told him I would not proceed any farther, without his Conſent. He told me in bad <hi>French,</hi> (for he had obſerv'd that the Captain and I ſometimes talk'd to one another in that Language) that I was very welcome to tell his unfortunate Story, but not to ſo many Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; for, added he, I perceive you know it very well. I gave him my Word only to tell the Captain, for which he thank'd me; but I told him, in return, that he muſt let me into the reſt of his Story; which he promis'd to do. The Captain and I, with my quondam Lawyer, took an Opportunity of leaving the Company, and walking a little way up the River Side, where I inform'd him that I came to the Knowledge of his Story, by the Porter that dogg'd him, (for I did not think it convenient to let him know that I was a Perſon concern'd) and that ſeeing him go into the Coach in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> I remember'd his Face again. He gave us his Story in the following manner.</p>
            <p>I was bred up to the Law by my Father, an Attorney of <hi>Lincolns-Inn;</hi> who dying, left me a ſmall Eſtate, which I ſoon ſpent in none of the beſt Company. I had no Thoughts of Buſineſs, 'till drove to it through the utmoſt Neceſſity. But finding Want approaching began to open my Eyes, I took Chambers in <hi>Cliffords-Inn,</hi> and reſolv'd to ſtick to Buſineſs. I ſoon found Clients enow through the Credit of my Father; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the rough as well as the ſmooth Part of the Law, I got Mony enough to ſupply even any Extravagance. I had ever been a very great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of the Female Sex, and had the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0388100100:174"/>
or rather the Ill, to ſucceed in moſt of my Amours.</p>
            <p>The firſt time I ever ſaw the fatal Cauſe of my Misfortune, was at St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s Church; (which, to my Shame I muſt own, I too often frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without Devotion.) Our Eyes often told us the Language of the Heart. I got the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſitting in the next Pew to her, but had never once diſclos'd my Paſſion.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Sunday,</hi> as the Clerk had ſet the Pſalm, ſhe begg'd I would lend her my Book; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe had left hers at Home. When ſhe had done, ſhe return'd it me, and thank'd me. I had reſolv'd with my ſelf to have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her out of the Church, but was preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Perſon that was afterwards her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. When I came home, I pull'd my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book out of my Pocket, but perceiv'd it would not ſhut as uſual, which put me on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining it. I found a Note pinn'd to the laſt Leaf, which I had not obſerv'd before: The Contents were to invite me to an Aſſignation that Evening at Six.</p>
            <p>I was very punctual, and found her there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. I begg'd her Pardon for making her wait, which ſhe eaſily granted with a gentle Reproach; and we ſoon came to a right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: for that very Night, before we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I had what I wiſh'd; the Sweet which was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the worſt of Bitters.</p>
            <p>She told me ſhe had long had a Paſſion for me; which, tho' ſhe reſiſted all ſhe could, got the better of her Modeſty, and forc'd her to declare it. She inform'd me too, that ſhe was ſpeedily to be married to the Man that led her out of Church, tho' it was much againſt her Inclination; but ſhe was oblig'd to comply with her Mother's Commands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0388100100:175"/>
We had many Meetings: ſometimes at my Chambers, till I was taken too much Notice of by ſome of my Neighbours: And when ſhe was married we often met at different Places, and ſhe as often made me handſome Preſents. He then related how he was diſcover'd at my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Houſe by one of the Prentices, (meaning me; but as he conceal'd his Face by turning it to the Window, he could not remember him.) He alſo related all that I have declar'd in the former Sheets; and added, that when the Operation was over, his Miſtreſs, as knowing him of no farther Uſe to her, left him without ſpeaking a Word. When I had recover'd Strength, ſaid he, to write, I ſent for ſome of my intimate Friends, and among the reſt a Surgeon. I told him my Misfortune, and was examin'd by him; but I was obliged to ſtay at the Inn ſeveral Days. At laſt (tho' almoſt a Miracle) I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cur'd, and return'd to my Buſineſs; but my Story getting Air, I was made the Scoff of every Body that ſaw me; till in ſhort my Life became a Burthen to me, and I took a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to go to ſome Part of the World where no one ſhould know me; and getting acquainted with Captain <hi>Dampier,</hi> he favour'd me ſo far as to enter me Steward. I had learnt to ſing when I was young; and my Voice, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear by my Loſs, is much improv'd. I had kept my Misfortune a Secret to all the Crew, if I had not receiv'd a Wound in my Thigh by an <hi>Indian</hi> Arrow on the Coaſt of <hi>Florida,</hi> a Year ago; for the Surgeon coming to dreſs me, when the extream Anguiſh had taken away my Senſes, perceiv'd my Condition and diſclos'd it to the Company: But I have the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune not to be flouted at.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0388100100:176"/>
When the Story was finiſh'd, we join'd our Company again, and ended the Day in Mirth and Jollity. The next Day my Crew went on Shore to regale themſelves; for Captain <hi>Dampier</hi> and I had alter'd our Reſolution of ſending both Companies together, for fear of Quarrels and Diſorder. And his Crew went on Shore the following Day.</p>
            <p>About Noon, as I was reading in my Cabin, I heard the Report of ſeveral Pieces; upon which I ran out, and went my ſelf to the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt Head, where I perceiv'd my Men, who were filling our Casks at the River of <hi>Parrots,</hi> ſurrounded by a multitude of <hi>Indians.</hi> I upon the Inſtant let ſlip our Cables, and having a ſtrong Sea Breeze, ſteer'd full into the River's Mouth at all hazards, ordering every Man to his Arms, and to load all our great Guns with Musket Ball. By good Fortune the Tide was almoſt at the higheſt, ſo that we came on broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Rivulet where our Men were defending themſelves. They had made a Rampart with the empty Casks, and had kept off the <hi>Indians</hi> with their Pieces; but juſt as we came, they had ſpent all their Ammunition, and had reſolv'd to ſubmit to the <hi>Indians.</hi> But aſſoon as they perceiv'd us, they took to their Heels, and ran towards our Ship, and the <hi>Indians</hi> after them; but we ſoon ſtopp'd their Career, by firing our double and round, which kill'd 'em above fifty Men, and put the reſt to Flight. We took our Men on Board, and intended to fall out of the River, but found the Tide turn'd; and before we could get out our Ship ran a-ground, ſo that we were oblig'd to wait till the next Tide. I was very uneaſie at this Accident, and order'd my Lieutenant to take the Boat, and acquaint Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Dampier</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0388100100:177"/>
In the mean time, not to be idle, I arm'd twenty Men, and order'd them to guard the reſt while they fill'd our Casks; which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done, and with the Long-Boat brought on Board. I would not let them be hoiſted into the Ship, for fear of hurting her now ſhe lay aground; tho' it prov'd to be a clayie Bottom.</p>
            <p>An Hour before Night we perceived an <hi>Indian</hi> running very ſwiftly to us, who call'd to us in <hi>Portugueze</hi> to fetch him aboard. Aſſoon as he was in the Ship, he told a Man that underſtood <hi>Portugueze,</hi> that the <hi>Indians,</hi> to the Number of a Thouſand, deſign'd in the middle of the Night to attack our Ship, and that they would come down in Canoes; for they very well knew we could not get out till Tide of Flood.</p>
            <p>This Man, whom we took for an <hi>Indian,</hi> was a <hi>Portugueze</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> had taken Priſoner a Year before, and underſtanding their Language learnt their Reſolution; and while they were calling their Number together, he took his Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make his Eſcape. I order'd him to be told he ſhould be rewarded for his Intelligence. I immediately call'd all the Officers together to conſult about the Danger, and we agreed to ſend to Captain <hi>Dampier</hi> for Help, who came with fifty Men well arm'd: And by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, aſſoon as it was dark, we landed ſix of our Cannon, and rais'd a ſmall Battery without any Noiſe or Buſtle; theſe were pointed up the River ſlaunting. Two of our Guns were load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with double and round, in the Stern of our Ship. The reſt of our Men were order'd in cloſe Coverts on each Side the River, with Directions to let the <hi>Indian</hi> Canoes paſs 'em, and not to fire till they were all gone by.</p>
            <p>Every thing was concerted and ſettled, and every man order'd to his Poſt, to expect the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0388100100:178"/>
Charge; and we had contriv'd it ſo well, that none of our Fires could hurt one another.</p>
            <p>About one a-clock in the Morning we could hear their Paddles in the Water, and ſoon after perceive 'em ſilently falling down the River, to the Number of two hundred Canoes. We let them come within fifty Yards of our Ship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we fir'd; but when we began, we made ſuch a terrible Slaughter of 'em, that I pity'd 'em. We took one Canoe with twelve <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and their Chief among them. When the Morning dawn'd, we were amaz'd to ſee what Havock Death had made; the very Shores were ſtain'd with Blood, and we had not loſt one Man of either of our Crews. The <hi>Portugueze,</hi> who gave us Notice, I rewarded with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pound, and two new Suits of Cloaths, both Linnen and Woollen; and we made Uſe of him for our Interpreter. He told us we had one of their <hi>Caciques</hi> among the Priſoners, and a Man of great Power among the <hi>Indians.</hi> I order'd him to ask him the Reaſon of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to us, ſince we had never offended them. He told him that he took us for <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze,</hi> Nations they hated from the barbarous Uſage they had met with from them: But he was ſorry he had moleſted us, being he was convinc'd we were <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as well as themſelves: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he would pay ſufficiently for his Ranſom, if we would ſpare his Life; and accordingly we agreed for a hundred Weight of Gold Duſt, and twenty in Ingots, and he order'd one of his Retinue to fetch it. In the mean time, we took the Advantage of the Tide, and fell down to our old Station.</p>
            <p>The next Day at Noon two Canoes arriv'd, one with the Gold, and ſeveral Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0388100100:179"/>
that came to wait on their King; and the other laden with Fruits and Proviſions, which I had equally parted between both Ships Companies. I took the Ingots for my Sharers, and the Duſt was divided among us according to our Allowance. Captain <hi>Dampier</hi> and his Crew were mightily pleas'd with their Dividend, and once more preſs'd me to accompany them: but I gave 'em a flat Denial for the preſent, with this Hope, that when I had viſited ſeveral Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the South-Sea, I would return to St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> and wait two Months for them there.</p>
            <p>We put the <hi>Indians</hi> on Shore, and the next Day weigh'd Anchor again, ſaluting Captain <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier</hi> with 11 Guns, who return'd the like Number, and we ſteer'd our Courſe with a freſh Gale, for the Streights of <hi>Magellan,</hi> I intending to paſs thro' thoſe Streights into the <hi>South-Sea;</hi> for I was of Opinion it would ſhorten our Voyage; and then my Curioſity ſtrengthen'd that Opinion: But I was advis'd by my Lieutenant to venture up to <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> a Town belonging to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where he aſſur'd me we might drive a very good Trade underhand with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. I communicated the Matter to the whole Company, who unanimouſly agreed it was the beſt Courſe we could ſteer. So we kept in with the Shore, and ſteer'd for the <hi>Rio de la Plata,</hi> or the <hi>River of Plate,</hi> which we reach'd in twenty Days without any Accident. As we had War with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> I had hoiſted <hi>French</hi> Colours, that we might have the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to trade with more Safety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> is ſituated above fifty Leagues up the <hi>River of Plate,</hi> which above the Town receives the Name of <hi>Paraguay;</hi> and takes its Riſe many Leagues up the Country; which is poſſeſs'd by a numerous Nation of <hi>Indians,</hi> who
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0388100100:180"/>
ſometimes trade with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but oftner murder 'em when they can meet 'em conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; for the Spirit of Revenge is ſuck'd in with their Milk, and handed down from Father to Son; ſo that they imagine it to be a very meritorious Deed to diſpatch one of them; and they are generally rewarded by their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cique</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> takes its Name from the excellent Temperature of the Climate, and its pleaſant Situation. They have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Ships of <hi>Europe</hi> not above once a Year, which bring 'em the Neceſſaries they want, and in Return eaſe 'em of their Gold; that being a Metal leſs eſteem'd than Iron, which proves more uſeful to them. When we were within two Leagues of the Port, we came to an Anchor in a little Creek in eight Fathom Water, a ſandy Bottom. We did not care to go nearer the Town, for fear the Governour ſhould have taken it in his Head to have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd our going out again.</p>
            <p>Though we were not in Sight of it, yet we had Canoes on board of us in an hour after our anchoring; and ſome of Note came <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> to be inform'd what we dealt in. One of them told me, he believ'd it would be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to diſpoſe of my Cargo, if I thought fit to make the Governour a ſmall Preſent. Accordingly I took his Advice, and ſent my Steward in my Name, with a Piece of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and half a dozen Pieces of <hi>Italian</hi> Silks; which he receiv'd as a very valuable Preſent, and ſent me Word he would not in the leaſt moleſt me, provided I did not deal too bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd. I underſtood him, and therefore was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cautious, ſelling but to one at a time, nor would I ſuffer another to enter my Ship, till the former was diſpatch'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0388100100:181"/>
In two Days I got rid of all the Cargo that I intended to part with, to a very great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and then I allow'd my Men Liberty to do what they thought fit with what they had, which gave them a general Satisfaction. The next Day I invited the Governour on Board, with ſome of the principal Merchants, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd them in my Cabin; and in return, I was to dine on Shore at the Caſtle. But I left a ſtrict Order with my Lieutenant how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf if I ſhould be ſtopp'd; for I knew the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be unfaithful People.</p>
            <p>When we landed, I obſerved the Town made but a mean Appearance, conſiſting only of two Streets built in the Form of a Croſs, and ſurrounded with a Mud Wall. The Caſtle it ſelf made but an indifferent Figure: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I was very elegantly entertain'd. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor ſeem'd to have leſs of the Formality of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> than ever I met with in any of them. When I took my Leave of him, he made me a Preſent of two <hi>Indian</hi> Slaves, and a Bar of Gold that weigh'd three Pound two Ounces. When I came on Board, I call'd a Council, to know what Courſe we ſhould ſteer next; for as to Traffick, I had no Pretence to go to the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> being all my Cargo was already diſpos'd of. We debated for ſome time, and at laſt we all agreed to go for the <hi>South-Sea</hi> upon the ſcore of Privateering. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated our Intentions to the Company, and they all ſeem'd very much rejoic'd at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution I had taken.</p>
            <p>Now I began to repent I had not join'd with Captain <hi>Dampier;</hi> for I wanted Men for any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Exploit, but I did not deſpair of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him in the <hi>South-Sea.</hi> We weigh'd Anchor, and ſteer'd for the Streights of <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0388100100:182"/>
with a fair Wind. One Morning my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant wak'd me, and told me that a Sail bore down upon us, and the Lieutenant deſir'd to know how to behave himſelf. I roſe upon the Inſtant, and, by the help of my Perſpective, ſaw it was a Veſſel with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours; but I imagining they were put up only for a Shew, I caus'd <hi>French</hi> Colours to be hoiſted, which ſoon was anſwer'd by the ſame in the Ship that purſu'd us. I order'd every thing to be prepar'd for an Engagement without any Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, commanded my Men not to appear upon Deck, and kept on my Courſe with crouded Sail, that our Purſuers might imagine I was willing to get from them; yet I order'd it ſo by falſe Steering, that they gain'd upon us. About Three in the Afternoon they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a League of us, firing every Quarter of an Hour a Gun to Leeward, to let us know we were to take them for Friends.</p>
            <p>I order'd our Men to tack about, hoiſt up <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours, and bear upon 'em. We ſoon perceiv'd we had much ſurpris'd 'em, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they kept up their <hi>French</hi> Colours, and ſeem'd to prepare for the Engagement, tho' they were much inferior to us. When we came along Side I hal'd 'em, and (after owning they were <hi>French)</hi> commanded them to ſurrender; but was anſwer'd with a Broadſide, which we return'd ſo faſt, that they ſoon ſtruck, and call'd for Quarter. I order'd the Captain to come on Board, who inform'd me that his Veſſel was call'd the <hi>Felicity,</hi> belonging to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Gennes,</hi> and had been ſeparated from the Fleet three Days before. I us'd the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain very handſomly, for the Sake of Monſieur <hi>St. Olon</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador. I gave him a Letter and a ſmall Preſent for that Gentleman,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0388100100:183"/>
and diſmiſs'd him without taking any thing from them. I found this Action did not pleaſe ſome of my Men; and not caring to have them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, I ſummon'd them upon the Deck, and told 'em the Obligations I had to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador; acquainting them, as this was a Ship of War, there was not much to be expected from 'em, therefore I told 'em I would ſhare five hundred Pound among 'em to make 'em Amends for their Diſappointment. But not one of them would accept a Penny; and in return I told them, I did not intend to make any more ſuch Compliments to the <hi>French,</hi> if ever they came into my Power again. They were very well pleas'd with my Declaration, and ſome of them prais'd my Generoſity; for tho' moſt Sailors are rough and blunt in Speech, yet they can in their way admire a generous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as other Men.</p>
            <p>Our Officers were under ſome Apprehenſions of meeting with the Squadron of Monſieur <hi>de Gennes,</hi> which being a Fleet of five Sail would certainly be too hard for us; and we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Captain of the <hi>Felicity</hi> that they were ſail'd for the Streights of <hi>Magellan.</hi> I found their Fears very reaſonable, and it would be a fool-hardy Action to encounter a Force ſo much ſuperior: For though Life was burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome enough to me, yet Humanity oblig'd me not to hazard the Lives of ſo many Men that were not out of Love with this World. So I reſolv'd to wave my Curioſity, and make for <hi>Le Maire</hi>'s Streights; which in five Days time we diſcover'd, known to Sailors by three Rocks, call'd the <hi>Three Brothers</hi> from their Likeneſs to one another.</p>
            <p>We found a ſtrong Current ſetting North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and an unuſual Toſſing of the Ship;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0388100100:184"/>
but we got through the Streights in two Days with Safety, and made for the <hi>South-Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Day we diſcover'd the <hi>Magellan Clouds,</hi> ſo well known to Sailors, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd us that we were over-againſt thoſe Streights that run into the <hi>South-Sea.</hi> Theſe Clouds are always ſeen in the ſame Degree, and the ſame orbicular Form. We kept on our Courſe, not intending to come within Sight of the Continent for fear of a Diſcovery; and the Weather favour'd us, it continuing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hazy.</p>
            <p>About an Hour within Night we heard the Sound of a Trumpet, which we conjectur'd muſt be on oard of ſome Veſſel, becauſe we were well aſſur'd we were not near enough the Land; upon which I immediately gave Orders to put out all our Lights, and ſteer our Courſe that Way we heard the Sound; which Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often gave us true Notice of their Courſe; and in half an Hour, tho' pretty dark, we gain'd Sight of 'em: But their Mirth was ſoon chang'd when we got up with 'em, thruſt out our Guns, and hail'd 'em. We underſtood they were <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and I order'd 'em to be told if they did not upon the Inſtant lye by, and ſend their Commander on Board, I would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fire upon 'em. They very readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with my Orders, hoiſted out their Boat, and the Captain came on Board me, whoſe Name was <hi>Don Juan Villegro,</hi> and his Ship the <hi>Wild-fire.</hi> He was employ'd by the Viceroy of <hi>Peru,</hi> to carry condemn'd Perſons to <hi>Baldivia,</hi> which is the Reſidence of moſt of the Rogues of <hi>America.</hi> But we were alſo inform'd they had the <hi>Real Situado</hi> on Board, which is a Sum of Money ſo call'd, that is ſent from the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of <hi>Peru</hi> to pay and cloath the Garriſon, as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0388100100:185"/>
well as to repair the Fortifications of <hi>Baldivia.</hi> This Sum uſually amounted to four hundred thouſand Crowns, but we could find no more than two hundred and fifty thouſand; but then, to make Amends for the Deficiency, we met with a great many valuable <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods, brought from thence by their <hi>Manilla</hi> Ship; for the Merchants always put their Supply for <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divia</hi> in the Ship that carries the Money to pay the Garriſon, that being the only Time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their Goods.</p>
            <p>This Prize made my Men mad with Joy, and I fear'd it would make 'em think they ſhould have enough, and conſequently deſire to return home. But I ſoon found it had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Effect, and they all expected, from this Earneſt of good Fortune, Riches enough in the Voyage we propos'd, to make 'em for ever.</p>
            <p>I treated the Priſoners handſomely, which were forty-ſix, including fifteen Felons, who were well pleas'd to have chang'd their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; expecting better Uſage from us than from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Baldivia,</hi> where they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd. There was one <hi>Roberts,</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> among them, who, I have been inform'd, has been executed ſince for Piracy; him, two <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> four <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Trumpeter, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in my Books to reinforce my Crew; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding their Crime was only Suſpicion of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, therefore I was convinc'd they were good Sailors. But I did not know how to diſpoſe of the Ship and the reſt of the Crew. If I ſhould give 'em their Liberty, they would of courſe alarm the Country; and if I kept them with me, Proviſions would fall ſhort; for they were victual'd but for a Month's Voyage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain being inform'd of my Fears, told me by an Interpreter, that he had
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0388100100:186"/>
receiv'd ſuch handſome Uſage from me, that he would upon his Honour ſteer to what Port I thought fit, and report if I pleas'd that I was ſail'd back again for the North Sea. I told him, though I could rely upon his Honour, he could not anſwer for all the reſt. At laſt I thought of a Stratagem to deceive the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Captain as well as the other Priſoners, as follows. In the firſt Watch of the Night (the Priſoners being all under Hatches) I came to our Sailors upon Deck, and told 'em the ill Conſequence of keeping or letting go the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; and therefore concerted with 'em that they ſhould pretend a Mutiny the next Day, and all declare for going back through the Streights into the North Sea. When the firſt Watch was reliev'd, I acquainted the other Moiety of the Company, and then retir'd to Reſt. But my Slumbers were broken with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of my dear Mrs. <hi>Villars:</hi> I dreamt I ſaw her in the Arms of the Renegado <hi>Hamet,</hi> ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling and calling out on me for Help, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could come to her Aſſiſtance, Death had freed her from the barbarous Wretch. This Dream had brought to my Mind all my Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and I can't tell how long I ſhould have continu'd feeding upon my Sighs, if I had not been alarm'd with Shouts and Noiſes upon Deck. I ran out to ſee what was the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and found my Men, as was deſign'd, in their feign'd Mutiny. I had forgot at firſt, and was much alarm'd; but recollecting, I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd on the Cheat. And Grief had ſo ſeated her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on my Countenance, with Thoughts of my Dream, that one of the Quarter-Maſters told me afterwards, my Looks were enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0388100100:187"/>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had leave to be upon Deck all the Day, and Care was taken to let them into the Secret. At Dinner I told the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (for he and the Merchants always eat with me) that I thought his Speeches yeſterday were prophetic, for I was compell'd to comply with my obſtinate Crew, and ſail for the North Sea again. He reply'd, he wiſh'd me happy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I went: And to carry on the Deceit, we ſteer'd our Courſe back again.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon <hi>Roberts</hi> came to me, and told me that one of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who was willing to ſtay with us, would undertake to bring me ten thouſand Pieces of Eight in ten Days, if I would let him have the Prize. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what <hi>Roberts</hi> ſaid, I ſent for the Man, and had him examin'd by <hi>Roberts,</hi> who underſtood <hi>Spaniſh</hi> very well. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> told me, he would not have me enquire into the Matter till it was done; and for the better Security I might ſend who I thought ſit with him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he had one of his Companions that was to help in the Deſign. Accordingly I order'd twenty Hands, and to obey the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in this Expedition as if he were their Captain.</p>
            <p>We agreed to wait for them the limited Time, in the ſame Degree we parted from 'em. I inform'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain, by an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that his Countryman was gone upon ſome ſecret Expedition, and aſſoon as he return'd we would purſue our Courſe. He anſwer'd, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had undertaken he was of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he would ſucceed in it, for he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as much Cunning as any Perſon in the World; he had been condemn'd to <hi>Baldivia</hi> once before, and had made his Eſcape from thence; and he did not doubt but he would get from them again, if he had been carry'd there the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0388100100:188"/>
ſecond time; and farther gave me ſome Hints that he might deceive me in this Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p>I began to be in ſome fear of having a Knaviſh Trick play'd me, and would have recall'd the Veſſel if it had not been too late; but hoping for the beſt, I reſolv'd to cruiſe till the Time appointed was expir'd.</p>
            <p>I had cloath'd my two <hi>Indians,</hi> that were preſented me by the Governour of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> in <hi>European</hi> Habits very handſome; and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue: They very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily learnt; and I gave them all the tender Uſage imaginable, which they were obligingly ſenſible of; and I believe they would have ſacrific'd their Lives to have ſerv'd me. I found them very handy, and docible, and very good-natur'd; which convinces me, if mild Methods were us'd with them, they might be very eaſily wrought to be Friends to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And I think 'tis great Pity ſuch a vaſt Body of People ſhould be ignorant of the Divine Being that form'd the Univerſe. Though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (it's true) ſend <hi>Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> among them to inculcate Chriſtianity, yet they generally neglect their holy Functions, and ſtrive all they can to inrich themſelves, by laying exorbitant Taxes upon the poor <hi>Indians:</hi> And I have been inform'd, that in ſome Parts of <hi>America</hi> all the Wealth they get is deliver'd to the <hi>Miſſion,</hi> reſerving to themſelves only what is needful, and that but from Day to Day. I had my two <hi>Indians</hi> made Chriſtians; one by by the Name of <hi>Robert,</hi> and the other <hi>Joſeph;</hi> being mine and my Father's Names. And I hope, in the Sight of God, Lay-Baptiſm will ſuffice; eſpecially when we had not the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the other Form. And it is not
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0388100100:189"/>
impoſſible, if they lead good Lives, they may find the Road to Heaven as well as if they had been chriſten'd in a Church, by an orthodox Clergyman.</p>
            <p>Three Days before the Time I expected my <hi>Spaniard</hi> back, we diſcovered two Sail making up to us, which made us prepare for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; but we ſoon perceiv'd it was our Prize, with another Veſſel. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> came on Board, and inform'd me that he had been ſomething better than his Word, for he believ'd that in Money and in Goods he had brought to the Value of 80000 Dollars. He gave us the following Account, by <hi>Roberts.</hi> Laſt time I was Priſoner at <hi>Baldivia,</hi> I was compell'd to work for one <hi>Don Sancho Ramirez,</hi> a ſordid, covetous, jealous, malicious Wretch, one that us'd to deal in Merchandize. It was his uſual Method to wait at a Country Houſe near the Sea, for the Arrival of the <hi>Real Situado</hi> Ship, (which was the ſame I had taken) and then go private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Board to deal with the Merchants. The Knowledge of this made me undertake this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, as well to get Money, as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on the old Villain, for the Stripes he has often given me without any Provocation. When we arriv'd within half a League of the Place, we perceiv'd a Bark riding at Anchor. I began to demur, as fearing we might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd; but at laſt reſolv'd to proceed, let what would happen. The Bark weigh'd and made towards us, which occaſion'd another Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; but my Fears were ſoon over, when I perceiv'd <hi>Don Sancho</hi> upon Deck. He hail'd us, and deſir'd we would ſlacken Sail, that he might come on Board. Accordingly we ran into a ſmall Creek, and came to an Anchor. I did not appear at firſt, but let the other
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0388100100:190"/>
               <hi>Spaniard</hi> that went with us perſonate the Captain, and inſtructed him accordingly. Aſſoon as he came on Board, he enquir'd for <hi>Don Juan Villegro,</hi> (for that Gentleman us'd to command the <hi>Real Situado)</hi> and was anſwer'd that he was very ill, and could not ſail this Voyage. Then he enquir'd for the Merchants, telling him that the Governor had diſcover'd his uſual Practice of Dealing firſt with them; therefore he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd to meet us in one of his own Veſſels, that was ready laden for <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and only ſtaid for our Arrival to ſet Sail. I was glad to hear of that, becauſe I intended to make Prize of it. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> invited him into the Cabin, while I went on board his Bark with ten Men arm'd, and ſecur'd it, there being but five Men and a Boy in it. The reſt of the Crew were on Shore.</p>
            <p>I cut her Cable, and our own, and made out to Sea again. When we were under Sail, I came on Board, and ſhew'd my ſelf to the old <hi>Don,</hi> and in a few Words made him underſtand his Condition. I thought at firſt we ſhould have been obliged to have bury'd him, for he look'd for a great while like one that was dead. But I recover'd him a little, by ſhewing him the Box that contain'd his Heart and Soul, (I mean his Money). He did his Endeavour to fly at me to be reveng'd on me, but he was held; but to give him a little more Comfort, I read over to him his Bill of Lading, and told him plainly, I would not deal with him, if his Goods did not anſwer his Bill. When he found he could do no good by Paſſion, he told me he would give me half his Money, if I would reſtore him his Ship and Cargo. I was very well as I was, I told him; and ſince I had got it all in my Poſſeſſion, I would have no more Dealings with him, only
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0388100100:191"/>
the odd ten thouſand Pieces of Eight more for his Ranſom. He was ſo thunder-ſtruck at this, that he did not ſo much as offer to open his Mouth to ſpeak; but kept ſo long ſilent, that I fancying he would never ſpeak again, took him upon Deck, that he might behold the lovely Proſpect of the Water; for by this time we were out of Sight of Land. His Heart then began to melt, and he fell down upon his Knees, and begg'd he might have his Liberty, notwithſtanding we had robb'd him. I was in a very great Paſſion, and order'd him to mollify the Word, and call it Over-reaching; which with much Chaſtiſement he did. But I told him he was obliged to make your Honour one Viſit, and accordingly I have brought him to wait on you.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I could not help admiring the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Ingenuity, and yet I did not greatly reliſh the Action; for tho' it was lawful Prize to us, yet I thought it was downright Robbery in him. However, I gave him the Thanks our Intereſt requir'd; and further told him (by <hi>Roberts</hi> our Interpreter) that he ſhould be very well reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Undertaking.</p>
            <p>The old <hi>Spaniard</hi> was brought on Board us, more dead than alive; and underſtanding we were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he ſpoke to me in that Language, and begg'd he might be ſet at Liberty. I told him he need not apprehend any thing, for he ſhould have his Liberty, and civil Uſage. He thank'd me as well as his Grief would give him leave, and I invited him to dine with me, which he did accordingly the ſame Day.</p>
            <p>I order'd the Cargo out of the Bark, which was very conſiderable, and moſt of the Proviſion, becauſe I fear'd it would be what we ſhould want. The other Veſſel, as belonging to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and one who could pretty well
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0388100100:192"/>
bear that Loſs, I intended to keep for our ſelves. The Bark I reſtor'd to <hi>Don Ramirez,</hi> with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bales of Goods that would prove of ſmall Uſe to us, tho' of Value to him; nay I would very willingly have given him all his Goods and Money too, if it had not been for wronging my Crew; for, as I ſaid, I look'd upon it as gain'd by Fraud. However, I ventur'd to give him back twenty thouſand Ryals, which did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to mine and my Owners Share. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd me his Acknowledgments, by giving me a very handſome Ring, that they had not taken from him, and told me, he ever thought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> generous Enemies.</p>
            <p>I caus'd all the Priſoners to be put on Board the Bark, and took my leave of 'em. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd me abundance of Thanks for my kind Uſage; and vow'd, if ever Fortune ſhould ſend any of our Countrymen among 'em, they ſhould fare the better for my Sake. I muſt own, I was not diſpleas'd with their Acknowledgments. A Man feels a ſecret Pleaſure within himſelf, when he has done a humane Action; when on the contrary, if a Perſon has been guilty of Baſeneſs, Horror and Remorſe gnaw his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>The Day after I had parted with the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I ſummon'd all my Men upon Deck, and told 'em what the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had done for 'em, and advis'd with 'em what Recompence I ſhould make him. We ſoon agreed he ſhould have five thouſand Pieces of Eight, his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion five hundred, and the reſt of 'em enter'd to a Share of the Booty we had before taken. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I ſent for 'em, and told 'em what I intended. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> return'd me ſuitable Thanks in <hi>French,</hi> for he had been inform'd I underſtood that Language. I found in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0388100100:193"/>
a ready turn of Wit and Humour, and of a Perſon that had read Mankind. He did not ſeem to be above thirty Years of Age, of a free and open Nature, having nothing of the ſtiff Formality of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> tho' born at <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Old Spain.</hi> I told him, I expected a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Life; he readily anſwer'd, he ſhould be proud to comply with my Deſires, but he begg'd I would defer it for ſome Time, till he might be a little more us'd to my Converſation; for, ſaid he ſmiling, mine has been a very merry and odd ſort of a Life, and therefore till I have more Freedom, I ſhall deſiſt, becauſe I ſhall loſe the Spirit in telling it.</p>
            <p>We ſteer'd our Courſe towards <hi>Panama,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending that our Priſoners would ſpread the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our going back again for the North Sea. In thirty ſix Degrees, and forty five Minutes, we diſcover'd a Veſſel ſteering the ſame Courſe; I order'd the Prize to chaſe her, and before Night ſhe took her. It was a Bark laden with Tallow and Hides, bound for <hi>La Conception.</hi> I repented the taking of her, for we ſoon found ſhe was but a heavy Sailor, and therefore could not keep Company with us, and it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for us to let 'em depart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Pedro Aquillio,</hi> which was the Name of of our Intelligent <hi>Spaniard,</hi> told me, he would undertake to diſpoſe of the Cargo and Bark to a good Advantage, if I could tell how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Men, which were but four, that is three <hi>Indians</hi> and a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> were very well pleas'd to be receiv'd as Servants on Board; yet we allow'd 'em a half Share in our future Purchaſes. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> we intended to detain on Board till we had made our cruiſing Voyage, and then releaſe him. So depending on <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Ingenuity, I let him go off with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0388100100:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Bark, with three <hi>Spaniards</hi> to aſſiſt him, having his Promiſe to return the next Day. We were then within five Leagues of <hi>La Conception,</hi> and therefore reſolv'd to remain in that Station till his Arrival, keeping <hi>Mamelles de Biobio,</hi> or the Dugs of <hi>Biobio</hi> (two Rocks ſo call'd) in View.</p>
            <p>The next Day we perceiv'd him coming with a Pirogue, a ſmall <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Boat with one Sail. He brought me a handſome Preſent of Fruit, and enough beſides for the whole Crew. Well, ſaid he, I have made but an indifferent Bargain; I have brought you but twenty thouſand Pieces of Eight: The old Rogue of a Governor would not give any more. He told me that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>La Conception</hi> ingroſſed all the Tallow and Hides, and forc'd the Retailers to give him his own Price; ſo he went boldly to him, and ſold him Bark and Cargo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Pedro</hi> advis'd us to cruiſe for the <hi>Manilla</hi> Ship, which was daily expected. His Advice was approv'd on all Hands, therefore Orders were given to Wood and Water the Ships for the Voyage; and accordingly we made for <hi>Juan Fernando,</hi> and arriv'd there the fifth of <hi>September</hi> 1695. It being a remarkable Day with me, it lives in my Memory; for the loſs of my Journal by an odd Accident, hinders my keeping a regular Account. We ſpent but two Days in wooding and watering, and killing Goats, which are there in great Plenty.</p>
            <p>There are three Iſlands that bear the Name of <hi>Juan Fernando,</hi> the firſt Diſcoverer, tho' there are no other Inhabitants on them than Goats. There's a noble Bay on the North Side of the Iſland, capable of containing five hundred Sail, where you anchor at ſixteen Fathom Water, a ſandy Bottom. We left it with a favourable Wind for our Deſign, and made farther up the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0388100100:195"/>
Coaſt <hi>January</hi> the firſt; and it was fear'd we had miſs'd our Booty, for the <hi>Manilla</hi> Ship ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally arrives at <hi>Acapulco</hi> about <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we reſolv'd to coaſt about for twenty Days longer, and if we fail'd of her, to return into the North Sea, with a Deſign to cruize down the Coaſt.</p>
            <p>We kept out of Sight of Land, for fear of being diſcover'd.</p>
            <p>On the ſixth we perceiv'd two Sail, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly gave 'em Chace. <hi>Don Philip</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd me it was the <hi>Manilla</hi> Ship, and a Guard-Ship along with her. We call'd a Council im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; where it was reſolv'd the Bark ſhould attack the <hi>Manilla</hi> Ship, while ours was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Man of War: And this was the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Don Pedro</hi> gave for it; that the <hi>Manilla</hi> Ship was ſo very unweildy, the Bark could play round her, and being ſo ſmall, ſhe was out of the reach of their Cannon, for they could make no Uſe but of thoſe upon their upper Deck. The Man of War ſeeing we gave 'em Chace, ſlacken'd her Sail to ſtay for us, imagining we ſhould both attack him, but he found himſelf miſtaken. Our <hi>Pink</hi> paſt him, without firing a Gun; but aſſoon as ever we came a-long Side, we gave him a Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, with a loud Huzza. He ſoon return'd it, but we ply'd him ſo cloſe, that he began to make off; but we follow'd him cloſe at the Heels, and coming under his Starboard Quarter, gave him another Broad-ſide, which brought his Main-Maſt by the Board; upon which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtruck.</p>
            <p>The Sea being very ſmooth, tho' a handſome Breeze of Wind, we mann'd our Long-boat, and I went on Board with forty Hands, well arm'd. When I came upon Deck, I order'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be taken on Board, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0388100100:196"/>
ſecur'd under Hatches; but I was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to find but ſixteen Men in the Ship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides eight that were kill'd, and not one that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd like an Officer among 'em. But we were ſoon inform'd, the Captain had order'd one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty of his Men on Board the <hi>Manilla</hi> Ship, aſſoon as they had diſcover'd us in the Morning, becauſe her Crew were moſt of 'em ſickly.</p>
            <p>We imagin'd our ſmall Veſſel muſt have warm work on't, being not above thirty five Hands in all. So we reſolv'd immediately to cut off the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Man of War, and leave her; for having loſt her Main-Maſt, ſhe could not follow us to do us any Damage; and ſix of her Men we took on Board us, who finding we were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſeem'd very willing to ſerve us; and I promis'd 'em their Share in the Booty, if we ſucceeded. Theſe ſix Men were old <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as they call themſelves, and they value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very much upon it, deſpiſing the <hi>Creolians.</hi> We made all the Sail we could after the <hi>Manilla</hi> Ship, and ſoon overtook her; for our ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel had kept her very well in Play, tho' ſhe had warm Work on't, and her Rigging was very much ſhatter'd, tho' they had not loſt a ſingle Man, but ſhe was obliged to fall a-ſtern to mend her Tackle. I order'd 'em to ſend me twenty Men on Board, which I was oblig'd to lye by for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had brought all my Guns to bear on one Side, and did not fire one till I came under her Stern; and then I pour'd 'em into her, and tack'd about to charge again. I obſerv'd a Boat buſy about her Stern, but could not imagine what they were doing. However I reſolv'd they that were in it ſhould find a difficult Matter to get on Board again. But I was much ſurpriz'd to find it my own Boat with <hi>Don Pedro</hi> in it, who
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0388100100:197"/>
had taken the occaſion in the Smoak of our firſt Broad-ſide to nail up the Rudder, ſo that the Ship could not tack about. He made what haſte he could on Board the Bark, which had now mended all her Rigging, and got under her Stern; and as faſt as the <hi>Manilla</hi> Ship ſent Men to clear her Rudder, he prevented 'em with his Small-ſhot. In the mean time we ventur'd to come a-long Side of her, notwithſtanding her monſtrous Bulk, and gave her ſuch Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they call'd out at laſt for Quarter, and ſtruck their Colours. I order'd all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to come on Board, which they did. I receiv'd 'em all very civilly, and immediately after went on Board the Prize. I was amaz'd at her vaſt Bulk. She had ſeven Decks, and built ſo ſtrong, that not one of our Shot had gone through; yet they had above ſixty Men kill'd, through their Ports, and other Vacancies; and what was very ſurprizing, we had not one, and but two wounded.</p>
            <p>They had above one hundred Men ſick on Board 'em, ſo that the Ship look'd like an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. It was very richly laden, and valu'd at 1800000 Dollars, and upwards. We found but little Money on Board, beſides the Plate belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Governor of <hi>Luconia,</hi> one of the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi> Iſlands, who was coming home to his own Country, being a Native of <hi>Mexico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' this was the richeſt Prize that ever was taken, yet we did not know well what to do with it. It would be an Impoſſibility to work her into the North Sea, or back again to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> without farther help; for we had more Priſoners by two to one, than we had Sailors on Board. So we once more advis'd with <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who counſell'd us to ſend to <hi>Acapulco,</hi> and have the Ship and Men ranſom'd.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0388100100:198"/>
We all thought it would be both difficult and dangerous. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> told us there ſhould be neither, and he would undertake to do it. But however, as it was a thing of very great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, we deſir'd he would tell us in what manner it ſhould be done; Why as thus, (ſaid he) I'll take the Bark, with the Captain of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War, the Quondam Governor, and one or two more of the beſt Quality, who ſhall make the Caſe known to the City of <hi>Acapulco,</hi> and no other way but by Letter; for I will ſuffer but one of them to go on Shore, and I'll take care to order it well enough to give you Notice, if they ſhould ſend any Force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, tho' there is no Danger they ſhould. For, added he, they have no Man of War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two hundred Leagues of 'em, that which was taken being all they had to guard their Coaſt. We were well ſatisfied with his Reaſons, and gave him leave to proceed as he thought fit; and accordingly the next Day he ſet Sail with thoſe Perſons mention'd along with him. And by the Advice of all, we follow'd him, being very well convinc'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, there was nothing of Force to be apprehended. I had fitted up the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War again, and reſolv'd to keep her, and diſpoſe of the Bark. Therefore, aſſoon as we came within Sight of Land, I order'd every thing to be taken out of her, and put on Board the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who we found was a very good Sailor.</p>
            <p>The Day following <hi>Don Pedro</hi> came on Board, with ſeveral Merchants and Perſons of Quality, to treat about the Ranſom of the Prize; and we agreed for 1200000 Dollars, after we had taken ſeveral Bales of rich Goods out of her. The Money was to be paid in ſix Days, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0388100100:199"/>
we were to ſtay where we rode; for I did not much care to truſt 'em too far.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we ſent all their ſick and wounded on Shore. The Bark we diſpos'd of for Proviſion, and other Neceſſaries, and took the Opportunity of waiting for the Money to Water our Ships. At the Time appointed, the Money came, and we ſurrender'd the Ship to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Now we agreed by joint Conſent to go home, for we were all rich enough, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the Crew thought ſo: Yet we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to touch at St. <hi>Salvador</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil</hi> (and make our Way through the <hi>Magellan</hi> Straits) as well to take in ſome Refreſhments, as to diſpoſe of the reſt of our Goods, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reen our Veſſels.</p>
            <p>Accordingly we put our Deſign in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made the beſt of our Way for the Straits of <hi>Magellan,</hi> and diſcover'd thoſe noted Clouds, which are a ſure Guide to Sailors, the third of <hi>May.</hi> We found the Weather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly cold, and the Mountains cover'd with Snow; but we were well provided with good Liquors, and all convenient Cloathing. We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor'd in <hi>Port Famine;</hi> formerly call'd <hi>Knight's Bay,</hi> by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in a Voyage 1598, with a Fleet of five Sail; where meeting with many Troubles, and to eternize the Memory of the Voyage, (it being the firſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> made to thoſe Straits) the Admiral knighted ſix of the Officers, by the Title of Knights of the furious Lion. The Oaths they receiv'd at the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony were, never to do, or conſent to do, any thing againſt their Honours, or to prejudice their preſent Voyage, to expoſe their Lives for the Service of their Commonwealth, and to do their utmoſt in driving the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from their
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0388100100:200"/>
golden World. They were inſtall'd on Shore, with a Sea-green Garter, and a Table built, with their Names engrav'd on it.</p>
            <p>We ſaw ſeveral of the Inhabitants, who were eaſily prevail'd upon to come on Board us. But I could find nothing extraordinary in their Height, as is fabulouſly reported. The talleſt I could ſee among them did not exceed ſix Foot. They are certainly a poor miſerable People, but very harmleſs; and I am apt to believe all former Stories of their monſtrous Height and Cruelty to be Fables.</p>
            <p>We got through the Straits once more into the North Sea, and by degrees came into a warmer Climate. But a terrible Storm over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took us, juſt as we were in Sight of <hi>Pepy</hi>'s Iſland, which drove us within Sight of Port <hi>Deſire,</hi> upon the Continent; and therefore we thought it the ſafeſt way to run into the Bay, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we did, and came to an Anchor in ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Fathom Water.</p>
            <p>At the South Side of the Port, lies <hi>Penguin</hi> Iſland, ſo call'd from a multiplicity of thoſe Birds reſorting there. Our Men went on ſhore, and in three Hours time brought on board five hundred of the Fowls, and ſeveral thouſands of their Eggs, which prov'd delicious Food. They are call'd <hi>Penguin,</hi> not from their Fatneſs, as ſome Authors affirm, but from their Whiteneſs mix'd with black. They are about the bigneſs of a Gooſe, weighing between nine and fourteen Pound; and tho' their chief Diet is Fiſh, yet they have no fiſhy Taſte. Their Skin is very thick, their Bill is like that of a Raven, tho' not altogether ſo crooked; their Neck is ſhort and thick, and the reſt of their Body reſembles a Gooſe, excepting the Wings, which are only two Stumps cover'd with Feathers, which they make
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0388100100:201"/>
Uſe of in Swimming. Their Feet are black, like thoſe of a Swan. They breed in Holes of the Rocks, which are ſo numerous, there is no walking hardly for fear of falling into them. When they walk on Shore 'tis upright, with their Wings hanging down, ſo that they appear in that Poſture like ſmall Pigmies. We ſtaid but two Days here, and then ſteer'd our Courſe for <hi>Rio Janeiro,</hi> or the River of <hi>January,</hi> intending to touch at St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>'s firſt, and if we did not ſucceed there, to ſail for St. <hi>Salvador.</hi> When we arriv'd there, the <hi>Portugueze</hi> would not admit us to enter the Bay, but fir'd ſeveral Guns from the Forts laden with Shot, to deter us from anchoring; we could not imagine the meaning of it, but however we left 'em in that Humour, and ſteer'd for St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> and in one and twenty Days we diſcover'd <hi>Praya de Zum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> a Place very eaſily known from a Number of white Spots, which appear like Linnen hung out to whiten, or dry.</p>
            <p>We paſt Fort St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and ſaluted it with eleven Guns, which return'd us an equal Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, without the charge of Shot, and came to an Anchor within half a League of the City; which we alſo ſaluted with eleven Guns, and receiv'd but ſeven in Return.</p>
            <p>By Advice of the Officers, we ſhar'd among the Sailors a thouſand Pieces of eight a Man, which pleas'd 'em exceedingly. The next Day, I went to wait on the Governor, who receiv'd me very civilly, and deſir'd I would dine with him. We were very magnificently ſerv'd, and a Band of <hi>Italian</hi> Muſic play'd all the while. After Dinner I made my Preſents, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of very kindly, but when I came to treat about our Commerce, he flatly deny'd me, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me it was againſt the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0388100100:202"/>
expreſs Orders, to ſuffer any Trading with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners. I begg'd his Pardon, if it was not to be comply'd with. He would have return'd my Preſent, but I preſs'd him to accept it in ſo obliging a manner, that he did; and told me in <hi>French,</hi> that ſince he ſaw my Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, he would comply with me. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent for ſeveral Merchants, and took 'em into his Cloſet, where they ſtay'd ſome time. When they came out again, the Governor told me thoſe Gentlemen would go on Board, and view our Commodities, and if we could agree, he would be anſwerable for the Money. One of the Perſons ſeem'd to be of a more free and open Diſpoſition than the <hi>Portugueze</hi> generally are. (Tho' moſt of the Inhabitants of St. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vador</hi> affect the Manners of the <hi>French.)</hi> We ſoon made an End of our Bargain, and my merry Merchant would oblige me to go a-ſhore and ſup with him that Night. He preſs'd me ſo hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, that I could not refuſe him; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I went with only my two <hi>Indian</hi> Servants, who began to be underſtood in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we arriv'd at the Merchant's Houſe, I was ſurpriz'd to find it ſo magnificent. He led us into a handſome Summer-houſe in the Garden, where he told me we were to ſup; and, ſaid he, to convince you that you are welcome, I'll bring my Wife and Daughter to keep us Company, which is reckon'd as a thing extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. But, added he, I have been in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and I find the Women are not the leſs Honeſt, for having their Liberty. I told him, I thought Conſtraint did but whet their Inventions to gain their Deſires. Said he, I am of your Mind, therefore give 'em all the Liberty they deſire, and I can't find I have had any reaſon to repent it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0388100100:203"/>
In a little time he uſher'd in the two Ladies, his Wife and Daughter, both very beautiful, and, notwithſtanding the Heat of the Climate, very fair. The Wife ſeem'd about five and thirty, the Daughter about ſixteen, and they both ſpoke very good <hi>French.</hi> Our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was kept up with all the Spirit I was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of: I ſoon diſcover'd a great deal of Wit in them both, and made 'em my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment in finding Ladies ſo extraordinary in ſo remote a Part of the World.</p>
            <p>When we had ſupp'd, the Merchant (whoſe Name was <hi>Don Jaques)</hi> told me it was his Cuſtom to provide Beds for his Gueſts, as well as Supper: And after we had walk'd a Turn or two round the Garden, we all retir'd to our ſeveral Apartments.</p>
            <p>The next Morning we drank Chocolate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and I invited <hi>Don Jaques,</hi> with his Wife and Daughter, to dine with me on Board the next Day, which he conſented to. I now begg'd Leave to be gone; but it being very hot, he had provided me a Silk <hi>Palanquin;</hi> which is a Thing like a Hammock, with a Canopy over it, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd by two Blacks, with each a Reſt to hang it on while they take Breath. This is all the Vehicle in Uſe at St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> by reaſon of the Unevenneſs and Steepneſs of the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I prepar'd for them with all the Magnificence I could the next Day. And when they ſaw the Variety of Diſhes, dreſs'd after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manner, they were mightily pleas'd; and, to add to their Satisfaction, the Muſick I had on Board play'd ſeveral elegant Pieces, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with the Trumpet I had got from on Board the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prize, (for notwithſtanding his being Trumpeter to the Garriſon of <hi>Baldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0388100100:204"/>
yet he was better pleas'd to be where he was.) We drank the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Health ſeveral times, with the Diſcharge of our Cannon: And when the Time for their going on Shore came, I faſten'd a ſmall Preſent of ſeveral ſorts of Silk upon the Wife and Daughter. <hi>Don Jaques</hi> perceiv'd what I was about, and merrily ſaid, That is not fair; we did not pay you for your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Yeſterday, and yet I believe it was as valuable as that you receiv'd to-day, at leaſt in my Opinion; I ſha'n't anſwer for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſaid he, they are both capable of ſpeaking for themſelves. I receiv'd many Compliments on all Hands; but not dealing much in them, I am very willing to forget 'em.</p>
            <p>In a Day or two after <hi>Don Jaques</hi> came on Board, and told me the Money for the Goods was ready, but I ſhould not have it, unleſs I came my ſelf to receive it. I accordingly went with him, and he made me continue there all Night, where we had the Converſation of the Ladies as before.</p>
            <p>When I was going away the next Day, he told me he ſhould ſoon find if any thing elſe beſides Money had the Power to bring me to ſee him. I told him, to convince him of that, I would come and dine with him the next Day; which accordingly I did. After Dinner I expreſs'd a Deſire of ſeeing the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Places in the City, which he comply'd with, and order'd two <hi>Palanquins</hi> to carry us.</p>
            <p>The City of St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil,</hi> is ſituated in the Bay of <hi>All-Saints,</hi> in 12 Degrees 45 Minutes Southern Latitude. It is divided into two Towns, the upper and the lower. The Streets are ſtrait, and pretty broad, but moſt of them very ſteep; and all the Goods
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0388100100:205"/>
are hoiſted in and out of the Veſſels by Machines for that purpoſe. It was formerly under the Dominion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but taken from them by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in 1624, and pretty well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by them; yet notwithſtanding that, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> retook it the next Year. I could not learn how long the <hi>Portugueze</hi> have poſſeſs'd it, but they all agree upwards of fifty Years. They have made it a regular fortify'd Place, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong; having five Forts beſides the Caſtle, well ſtor'd with Cannon, and other Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſmall Arms for ten thouſand Men. This is the uſual Seat of the Viceroy of <hi>Braſil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but when I was there it was without one, tho' he was expected every Day,</p>
            <p>The Cathedral is a magnificent Pile of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, finely adorn'd, and painted after the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Manner. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Church is a noble Structure, all of <hi>European</hi> Marble; with a fine Organ, the Pipes gilt. There are many more fine Churches, twenty in all, beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Convents and Monaſteries.</p>
            <p>This Place is alſo the Reſidence of a Biſhop, who has a handſome Palace; and for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend the Clergy, I never ſaw ſuch a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the bigneſs of the Place any where, as <hi>Benedictines, Franciſcans, Carmelites, Auguſtins, Capuchins, Dominicans,</hi> and <hi>Barefoot Fryars;</hi> (tho' I think moſt of the People I ſaw there wore no Stockings.) There are three Nunneries, well ſtor'd with Nuns, but not to be ſeen; nor hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Women in the Town, but common Whores, or black Slaves; for the <hi>Portugueze</hi> lock up their Wives and Daughters as careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they do their Money, and would have none look upon them but themſelves; except my Friend <hi>Don Jaques;</hi> which is ſomething the more extraordinary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0388100100:206"/>
It is a Place of great Trade to <hi>Guinea,</hi> and other Parts, and is accounted one of the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cities in the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. By moderate Account there may be about 20000 Whites, (or I ſhould ſay <hi>Portugueze,</hi> for they are none of the whiteſt,) and about tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Number of Slaves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Jaques</hi> would make me take five Days up in viewing the ſeveral Parts of the City, and oblig'd me to be at his Houſe without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Board during that Time. Some Part of the Day we play'd at <hi>Ombre,</hi> a Game migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily in Vogue among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze,</hi> and a very entertaining Game for three, invented by the jealous <hi>Spaniards</hi> for that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to prevent any clandeſtine Doings between two. But alas! I believe there are more Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities gain'd than loſt by it.</p>
            <p>We had provided every thing we wanted now, and began to prepare for our Departure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Jaques</hi> was very ſorry to loſe me, he told me; and indeed it was with ſome Regret I left him; for his Civility had drawn from me a Friendſhip inſenſibly. I went to take Leave of the Governour, who made me a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of <hi>American</hi> Sweetmeats, and begg'd I would dine with him, which I could not in good Manners deny. When Dinner was over, <hi>Don Jaques</hi> was ſo obligingly preſſing for me to ſup with him the laſt Time, that I could not refuſe; but I begg'd he would excuſe my ſtaying all Night, and he gave me his Word he would not preſs me. I ſent one of my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> to order the Boat to fetch me at Ten that Evening.</p>
            <p>When the time of my Stay was expir'd, I took my Leave of <hi>Don Jaques</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, after having forc'd him to accept of a
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0388100100:207"/>
Gold Watch, and the Ladies a Preſent of each a Diamond Ring, that I receiv'd from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Luconia,</hi> for my Civility in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his Plate and Jewels, when we took the <hi>Acapulco</hi> Ship in the <hi>South-Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, ſaid <hi>Don Jaques,</hi> I ſee you will pay for your Board in ſpight of my Teeth. I had taken Leave of the Wife and Daughter before, who had left us in Tears. I muſt own I thought my ſelf very much oblig'd for their Tenderneſs; and it drew ſuch a deep Melancholy upon my Face, with Thoughts of my dear Wife, that <hi>Don Jaques</hi> imagin'd it was Grief for parting with him and his Family. I did not take any Pains to undeceive him. Well, ſaid he, I ſee a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may be contracted in a few Days, as well as Love, eſpecially where there is a Harmony of Souls.</p>
            <p>We had agreed to correſpond together, and I had undertaken to ſend him ſome <hi>European</hi> Goods, if it pleas'd God to guard me ſafe to <hi>Europe.</hi> I had continu'd longer with <hi>Don Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> than I had intended to do, therefore, whatever Violence I did my ſelf, I took my Leave. <hi>Don Jaques</hi> tenderly embrac'd me, and was ſo much overwhelm'd with Grief, that I could not forbear ſympathizing with him: But I order'd his Servants, (whom I had liberally rewarded for the Trouble I gave) to ſhut the Door, to prevent their Maſter's going any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I walk'd towards the Port very melancholy, though with ſome Precipitation; but was rouz'd out of it by one of my <hi>Indians</hi> crying, Maſter, take a Care, take a Care! I turn'd about, and ſaw four <hi>Portugueze</hi> purſuing us. I made a Stand, and drew my Sword, took my Cloak from my <hi>Indian,</hi> and put it acroſs my Arm to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0388100100:208"/>
defend my ſelf the better. They all four at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd me at once; but my <hi>Indians,</hi> whom I had order'd to wear Swords on Shore, fell upon 'em furiouſly, and diſpatch'd two of 'em imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; and I had made a ſhift to drop a third, though not without receiving ſeveral Wounds. The fourth ran for it; but my <hi>Indians</hi> being as nimble-footed as Does, ſoon overtook him, and dragg'd him down the Hill by the Hair of his Head; while he cry'd out all the while, <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordia! Miſericordia!</hi> The Noiſe we made had brought up my Boat's Crew, who were all arm'd with Piſtols and Cutlaſſes; and the Guard coming in the mean time, and ſeeing my <hi>Indians</hi> dragging the Fugitive, fell upon us: But my Crew and <hi>Indians</hi> charg'd 'em ſo furiouſly, that they ſoon put 'em to Flight, though treble our Number: Though this avail'd us but little, for the whole Garriſon was coming down upon us. I then order'd my Crew to reſiſt no more, but ſubmit to 'em; for as we were innocent, I did not much fear to come off clear.</p>
            <p>The Buſtle had rouz'd <hi>Don Jaques,</hi> and his Servants, who were ſoon inform'd of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I was in, and he came in good time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his Authority; for the <hi>Portugueze</hi> began to be outragious. But the Governour had ſent a Gentleman to bring us before him: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I went, accompanied by <hi>Don Jaques.</hi> But the Wounds I had received bled ſo much, that they were oblig'd to carry me to <hi>Don Jaques</hi>'s, and ſend for a Surgeon. My Hurts were not dangerous, but I was very faint with Loſs of Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Jaques</hi> waited on the Governour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him of the Condition I was in: But the Governour not underſtanding who was the Aggreſſor, order'd a Guard of Soldiers at the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0388100100:209"/>
Door of the Houſe where I was. My Boat's Crew ſoon got on Board, and alarm'd both the Ships, who immediately weigh'd and came cloſe to Shore, where they had prepar'd to fire upon the Town, if I was not releas'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly. I underſtanding the Matter, ſent one to inform them, that the Guard was ſet upon me to ſecure me from the Inſults of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze,</hi> till the Truth of the Matter was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. This would not ſerve their Turn, but a hundred of 'em, with the Officers and <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> landed, all well arm'd, and vow'd to wait the Event on Shore. The Governour did me the Honour of a Viſit, and enquir'd into the Cauſe; and I inform'd him, as well as my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would permit me. When they had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the dead <hi>Portugueze,</hi> they found one of them was Nephew to the deceas'd Viceroy. Upon the Diſcovery of which, the <hi>Portugueze</hi> began to be very much exaſperated, and were hardly reſtrain'd from ruſhing into the Houſe, and tearing me to Pieces; for though they did not regard the Nephew, yet they had a great Veneration for his deceas'd Uncle, who behav'd himſelf with a great deal of Candour in his Poſt, and the Inhabitants mightily regretted his Loſs. The Governour appeas'd their Fury, by telling 'em I ſhould have no Favour ſhewn me if I were guilty, let the Conſequence be what it would. And immediately a Court was ſummon'd to try me, tho' it was Midnight, and I was carry'd there in a <hi>Palanquin,</hi> weak as I was. But I was oblig'd to ſend for my Lieutenant, and tell him that there was no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and alſo order'd him to ſend the Crew on Board again. When we came to the Place of Juſtice, the Governour order'd me a Seat: But the Buſineſs was ſoon ended; for the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueze</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0388100100:210"/>
we had ſecur'd, own'd that his Maſter had deſign'd to murder me, becauſe he was inform'd I was his Rival in the beautiful <hi>Donna Bianca,</hi> (which was the Daughter of <hi>Don Jaques.)</hi> I was very much ſurpris'd (as well as <hi>Don Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques)</hi> at this Report, and we both declar'd it was only a jealous Suggeſtion of the Gentleman; which every one came into: And the Grounds he had for it, was my often frequenting <hi>Don Jaques</hi>'s Houſe, upon the ſcore of Friendſhip only, and lodging there.</p>
            <p>The Governor handſomely diſmiſt me, and told me he was very ſorry I had been detain'd from my Affairs. I return'd, that I was as ſorry to be the Cauſe of ſo unhappy an Accident, in a Country where I had receiv'd ſo much Civility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Jaques</hi> begg'd I would go back to his Houſe, and ſtay till my Wounds were well; but the Governour took us aſide, and ſaid to us in <hi>French,</hi> I know, <hi>Don Jaques,</hi> 'tis your Friendſhip for the Captain that makes you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his Company; but, if I might adviſe you, I would have him go on Board upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; for though he is very innocent as to the Matter, yet I doubt ſome of the Deceaſed's Friends or Relations, which are numerous, not having Regard to Juſtice, will contrive ſome Method to diſpatch him out of the Way: for moſt of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> are jealous, malicious, and revengeful, and very ſeldom look into the Merits of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>I thank'd the Governour for his kind Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and <hi>Don Jaques,</hi> notwithſtanding his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, could not but come into what he had ſaid. I therefore order'd my ſelf to be carried on Board that Moment. It being broad Day, the Governour and his Guard would accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me to the Water-ſide, but <hi>Don Jaques</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0388100100:211"/>
would go on Board with me. In the Boat he told me he had ſome Thoughts of coming to reſide in <hi>England,</hi> for, ſaid he, I have enough, and therefore I will, in two or three Years more, leave off Traffick and live quiet in the World. But he begg'd I would write to him aſſoon as I arriv'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> and let him know the Place I had choſe to live in; for, added he, let it be where it will, if it is ever my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to arrive ſafe in <hi>Europe,</hi> I'll take another Voyage only for the Hopes of ſeeing you. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd him the Acknowledgment due to ſo much Friendſhip, and we parted with Tears on both ſides.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as I had got on Board, the Wind being fair, we weigh'd and ſtood out of the Bay. When we were out at Sea, a Letter was brought me written in <hi>French,</hi> the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of which is as follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                     <hi>I</hi> Was reſolv'd to make Tryal of you before I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd my Heart to chuſe you for a Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I am ſo well convinc'd of the Sincerity of your Soul, that I will confide in you a Secret dear to my Repoſe. I had an Amour with a beautiful Lady before I was marry'd, that produc'd the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this Letter. I have kept him conceal'd from my Family hitherto; but the Perſon I truſted with his Education and this Secret, being dead, I fear'd I ſhould find ſome Difficulty to conceal him any longer here: Therefore, depending upon your good Nature and Friendſhip, I have ventur'd to ſend him to you, with Sufficient to bear his Expences in his Education, which I would have ſuitable to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate I have in my Power to give him. I ſhall

            <p>I muſt own I was very much ſurpriz'd at this Epiſtle, and could not imagine his Reaſons for concealing it from me. I order'd the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that brought the Letter to be conducted in, and immediately enter'd my Cabin one of the beautifulleſt Boys I had ever ſet my Eyes on. He ſeem'd about Fifteen, his Hair fair and long, curling down his Shoulders: In ſhort, every Feature ſo exact and uniform, and ſo innocent withal, that I was amaz'd. At laſt I took him by the Hand and embrac'd him, and told him for his Father's ſake he ſhould be as dear to me as my own Son. But finding he did not anſwer me, for I ſpoke to him in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the ſame in <hi>French.</hi> He return'd me Thanks, and ſaid he did not doubt but he ſhould find it ſo.</p>
            <p>After ſome time, he deliver'd me a Casket, in which were Jewels to the Value of five thouſand Piſtoles, and a little Box which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a thouſand Moidores. I told him I would take as much Care of them as if they were my own.</p>
            <p>Theſe, Sir, ſaid the Youth, are deſign'd to bear my Charges. Then ordering another Box in, had it open'd, and told me what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd was a Preſent from his Father to me. When I examin'd it, I found ſix Silver Diſhes, and three dozen of Plates of the ſame Metal; a dozen of Knives, Forks, and Spoons in Gold, and half a dozen of Gold Sweet-meat Plates
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0388100100:213"/>
In a larger Box was variety of all manner of Conſerves and Cordials; and I was informed he had made ſmall Preſents to every Officer in the Ship, and to the common Sailors a Week's freſh Proviſion, with Liquor in proportion. I was amaz'd at his Bounty, for his Preſent to me was what a Prince might have receiv'd. I thought it was my Duty to ſhew all the Kindneſs I was capable of to the Son of ſo generous a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore I order'd him a Field-Bed in my own Cabin; and his Behaviour was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, that I felt as much Tenderneſs for him as if he had really been my own Child; and having Skill in Surgery, I truſted him with the Management of my Wounds; though I had a very good Ship-Surgeon, who ſupply'd him with what he wanted. My Hurts, which were not dangerous, ſoon heal'd, and I recover'd my Strength again. I could not prevail upon young <hi>Don Ferdinand, (Don Jaques</hi>'s Son) to go often upon Deck. He ſaid he would rather chuſe to ſtay in the Cabin, where he had <hi>French</hi> Books of his own, and ſome of mine to entertain him; for I had taken my Opportunity to procure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral at St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> and among the reſt a <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grammar and Dictionary, which mightily pleas'd <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> for he had a great Deſire to learn <hi>Engliſh:</hi> I gave him all the Helps I could; and he in return, inſtructed me in the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Language; ſo that in a ſhort time we could diſcourſe in either.</p>
            <p>We had reſolv'd to ſteer our Courſe for the Iſland of <hi>Tercera,</hi> the Capital of the <hi>Azores;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fifty Days Sail, we diſcover'd the Peak of one of the Iſlands of <hi>Azores,</hi> which is called <hi>Pico,</hi> from the Mountain. It is in the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Pyramid, and may be diſcovered as many Leagues off as the <hi>Pike of Teneriff;</hi> for
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0388100100:214"/>
we were then by Obſervation thirty Leagues off from it, and yet could ſee it diſtinctly.</p>
            <p>In two Days more we diſcover'd the Iſland of St. <hi>Michael.</hi> We were all pleas'd that we had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd that Part of the World we call <hi>Europe,</hi> the Birth-place of moſt of us; and what pleas'd us more was, that we had made all our Fortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 19th, 1696, we anchor'd in the Bay of <hi>Angra,</hi> the Capital of the <hi>Azores,</hi> in the Iſland <hi>Tercera.</hi> I can't give any great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to the Port, being I think it a very indifferent one. We did not deſign to ſtay long, only to get ſome Water, and ſome freſh Proviſions; for we were inform'd there was no riding out a Storm there. We got in what we wanted with all Expedition we could, while the Weather was favourable.</p>
            <p>The City is ſeated at the Bottom of the Bay, under the Brow of a Hill call'd <hi>Monto de Braſil,</hi> or the <hi>Braſil</hi> Mountain; but for what reaſon ſo call'd, I could not be inform'd. It is very well fortify'd, having two ſtrong Caſtles, and eight Batteries beſides, with Guns of thirty Pounds Shot. But it is very indifferently garriſon'd, having no more than two hundred Men in Pay, and moſt wretchedly ſupply'd, having no cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for three Years.</p>
            <p>The Town is very agreeable, having a Stream of Water running quite through it, which drives ſeveral Miles for the Uſe of the Publick; and almoſt in every Quarter are publick Fountains of excellent taſted Water. From this Place are brought the fineſt Canary-Birds, tho' leſs than thoſe of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> yet they exceed 'em far in the Excellency of their Pipes.</p>
            <p>Money is very ſcarce here, and conſequently every thing cheap. I bought two Months Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit for the Ships, much cheaper than in any

            <p>I was grown ſuch a Proficient in the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> Tongue, that I could make a ſhift to be underſtood; and by underſtanding that Language, ſoon found a Gate to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue, by the help of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who had learnt to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> very fluently. We got acquainted with one of the Fathers of the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> who ſhew'd us the Churches, and other things of Note in the City. The Cathedral is a very handſome Building, and well painted, which goes by the Name of St. <hi>Salvador;</hi> and there is no danger of miſſing that Title, and St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> every where among the <hi>Portugueze.</hi> There's no leſs than twenty, beſides the Cathedral; with four Monaſteries, and four Convents, that have each their Chapel beautifully adorn'd. When we had got what Refreſhments were wanting, we ſet ſail for the <hi>Straits,</hi> intending to touch no where, before we were got into the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean;</hi> and becauſe we met with nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in our Voyage to <hi>Gibralter;</hi> I will, to divert the Reader, give him, (inſtead of Bearing of Coaſts, Changes of Wind, and unexpected Storms,) the Life of my Companion <hi>Don Pedro Aquilio;</hi> which he related to us during the Voyage, in the following Manner.</p>

He foreſeeing what would happen, took care of his Affairs accordingly; ſold his Eſtate in <hi>France,</hi> and ſent my Mother to <hi>Sevil,</hi> the Place of his Birth, whither he ſoon follow'd. The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> having a very great Regard for him, gave him ſeveral Offices of Honour and Proſit; and when I was born, I was Son to the firſt Man in the City. My Father, by living ſo long in <hi>France,</hi> had contracted the Manners of the <hi>French;</hi> and the Formality of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſeem'd as ſtrange to him, as if he had been born in another Climate. He had ſeveral Children,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0388100100:217"/>
tho' none ſurviv'd but my ſelf. When I had Years enough over my Head to fear the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Education, he took a Reſolution of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to the College of the four Nations in <hi>Paris,</hi> to compleat my Studies. And the firſt thing I learnt, was to ſhake off all the Cuſtoms of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was ſoon done; for they had taken but ſmall Impreſſion in my Mind, becauſe I found my Father was averſe to 'em. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a Friendſhip with ſeveral young <hi>French</hi> Noblemen of my own Age; for Parity of Years is the firſt Step to Friendſhip.</p>
                        <p>When I had reach'd my fifteenth Year, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of a Miſtreſs, to compleat my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And as I found it was a Method among my Companions, to ſupplant each other in their Females without any Animoſity, I ſet my ſelf ſo willingly about it, that out of half a dozen <hi>Madonas,</hi> I made my ſelf Maſter of ſix of 'em. This occaſion'd many Plots and Contrivances to regain the flying Fair Ones: Tho' I perceiv'd moſt Money laid out in Preſents had a prevailing Force with 'em. We had our Allowance paid quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and getting all my Companions into ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, I had the good Fortune to ſtrip 'em all. They ſeem'd to be a little uneaſy, in loſing their Miſtreſſes and Money too; and my telling 'em, as I had got the Females, I ſhould have the moſt occaſion for the Money, ſignify'd nothing, but they all begg'd it as a great Favour, that I would lend 'em half what I had won, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid the next Quarter; which to oblige 'em, I comply'd with, and to play we fell again; but Fortune chang'd her amiable Looks from me, and I ſoon loſt all I had won, with my own Share too. The fickle Dame favour'd one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that would not lend any of us a Penny. This chagrin'd the reſt very much. But to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0388100100:218"/>
any more Importunity, he went away to his own Chamber, leaving room in all our Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets for the Devil to dance a Saraband, for we had not one Croſs to keep him out; and what was our greateſt Mortification, the Holydays were approaching, that us'd to give us the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of rambling into the Country. The Perſon that won our Money, happen'd to be the laſt that was added to our Society; and tho' he had not been long among us, we began to be tir'd of him, as much from his odd Humours, as his Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy. I at laſt thought of a Project to be reveng'd on him, and it was very much approv'd by the reſt of my Companions. The Holydays being come, we deſign'd for our Country Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous; but he that bore the Purſe would not go with us, without we could produce every one ſo much Money. This put us to our Shifts again: But my Man, who was an arch Wag, begg'd that I would accept of what he had; for I had been ſo lucky as to have paid him his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, before my Loſs. I accepted of his Offer, and took from him ten <hi>Lewis d'Ors:</hi> We contriv'd it ſo well, that they were ſhown to old Sir Snip, from every Perſon of our Society. Well, ſaid he, ſixty <hi>Lewis d'Ors</hi> will do our Buſineſs; but who ſhould be Purſe-bearer was what he cavil'd at; and not caring to truſt any of us, (and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to truſt him) he pitch'd upon my Man to be Caſh-keeper for us all. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he put down in his Pocket-book, ſo much Money in Bank, receiv'd of ſuch and ſuch Perſons, when in reality he had but twenty <hi>Lewis d'Ors.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When we had contriv'd every thing, we took Horſe, and rode ſix Leagues that Evening, to the Place where we deſign'd to put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our Project. We had agreed to pay every
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0388100100:219"/>
Night the Expences of the Day, and have it ſet down in my Man's Book. But when he was call'd for (as we had concerted) no Man was to be found. There was ſtrange Enquiry made to no purpoſe; and we all agreed he had taken the Opportunity to rob us, and run away with our Money. All that we had to do, was to beg of Snip to diſcharge the Houſe. But he declar'd he had not half a Piſtole in his Pocket: which we knew very well, for he had ſew'd all the reſt into his Waſtecoat. Since it falls out ſo unluckily, ſaid I, don't let us make known our Wants to the Houſe, but go to reſt, and conſult to-morrow. I lay with Snip, for fear he ſhould take it into his Head to ſneak off. In the Night, when I found he was faſt a-ſleep, I bundled up all his Cloaths, and threw them out of the Window to my Man that waited for them.</p>
                        <p>When Morning came, I deſir'd him to riſe, that we might get all together to conſult; but no Cloaths were to be found. He began to ſtorm, and ſwear, but all to no purpoſe; for not one of his Oaths would bring back a Rag of his Cloaths. He told us in his Ravings, that he had loſt ſo much Money, ſew'd up in his Waſtecoat. We upbraided him for his Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in not letting us ſhare with him; but it did not ſignifie any thing. He threaten'd to go to the <hi>Provoſt,</hi> and have the Landlord ſecur'd; and would have don't, if he had not been naked.</p>
                        <p>After raving to no Purpoſe, he was oblig'd to go to Bed again to avoid catching cold. He ask'd us what he ſhould do in his Condition, but all the Advice we gave him brought him no Conſolation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0388100100:220"/>
He was very tall, and large made, and we us'd to call him in Ridicule the <hi>Infant.</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ſell his Horſe to cloath him; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much out of Size, there was not any thing to be had ready made that would fit him: This was ſtill worſe and worſe; and tho' the Horſe was ſold for twenty <hi>Piſtoles,</hi> we contriv'd it ſo, that my Landlord ſeiz'd the Money for his Reckoning. This put him almoſt beſide himſelf, and he was ready to expire with Vexation.</p>
                        <p>I pretended to be much concern'd at this Uſage, while the reſt of our Company laugh'd at his Misfortune. I ſeem'd to be very angry with them; and told 'em I would do my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to remedy every thing. I made 'em ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, that I had juſt call'd to mind a Perſon, a Friend of mine, that liv'd in the Town, much of the Infant's Size, and I would go to borrow a Suit of Cloaths for him. He ſeem'd very much rejoyc'd at this; for he reſolv'd, aſſoon as ever he was dreſs'd, to take up the <hi>Landlord,</hi> and ſwear the Robbery againſt him.</p>
                        <p>I went as he ſuppos'd about his Cloaths; and after ſtaying ſome time below, I went up with a Bundle, and ſeem'd very much concern'd that I could not ſucceed. I told the <hi>Infant,</hi> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was gone to <hi>Lyons</hi> about Buſineſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and had carry'd all his Cloaths with him. But I had brought him a Maſquerade Habit that he had left behind him.</p>
                        <p>He expreſs'd ſome Satisfaction at the Sight of it, that he ſhould not be confin'd to lie in Bed. But, ſaid he, if it were not only for the Name of Cloaths, a Man might as well go naked, for there's no ſtirring abroad in this Dreſs.</p>
                        <p>It was the Habit of a Satyr, that we had made on purpoſe for the Occaſion, before we left <hi>Paris.</hi> When we had equip'd him, it was as much as I
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0388100100:221"/>
could do to keep my Countenance at the Figure he made; and he ſeem'd very much diſſatisfy'd with it, but however he wore it for the Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of not lying in Bed.</p>
                        <p>When we were at Dinner, we had many Contrivances to get away, but none feazable.</p>
                        <p>I told 'em at laſt, I had thought of a Deſign would certainly do our Buſineſs, and make up our Loſſes, if the <hi>Infant</hi> would conſent to it. He readily reply'd, he would ſtick at nothing to do that. Why then, ſaid I, if you'll ſuffer your ſelf to be ſhown in that Habit, as a Monſter newly arriv'd, I'll anſwer for the Succeſs of it.</p>
                        <p>After much talk, he agreed to do it, on this Proviſo, that his Face ſhould be diſguis'd. I told him, I would ſtep to my Friend's Houſe, for the Mask that was made to the Habit. I return'd and gave it to him, and he was ſoon ſatisfy'd with the Project.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding the Buſtle we made, none of the Houſe (but the Landlord) knew any thing of the Matter, and the next Day it was given out about the Town, that a Monſter was to be ſhown in the Afternoon. We had procur'd a Chain, and other Materials, to carry on the Joke; and when the time came to ſhow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, we had ſuch a Concourſe of People to ſee our Monſter (it being in the Holydays) that our Profit gave us ſome Satisfaction. For when the time of ſhowing was over, our Money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to three and twenty <hi>Piſtoles;</hi> and the Monſter behav'd himſelf ſo well with our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, that he gave a general Content.</p>
                        <p>We had taken care he ſhould appear ſo fierce, that none ſhould approach near enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Deceit. We had a great deal of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion at the ignorant People's Suggeſtions. One Country Fellow ask'd how old he was? I told
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0388100100:222"/>
him four Years, three Months, and five Days. Lord bleſs me! (cry'd he out) why, by that time he comes to be twenty, no Houſe will be able to hold him.</p>
                        <p>In fine, we ſhow'd him ſo long, that our Money mounted to upwards of one hundred Pounds, which pleas'd our <hi>Infant</hi> ſo well, that he deſir'd to continue a Monſter all the time of the Holydays. But we reſolv'd to carry the Joke no further, tho' we did not tell him ſo.</p>
                        <p>We left the <hi>Infant</hi> chain'd to the Poſt of the Window, as uſual, went down to my Landlord, and gave him Inſtructions how to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We took care to ſatisfy him very well for the Trouble he had been at.</p>
                        <p>We all rid away to the next Village, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up our Horſes, return'd on Foot, one by one, back again to the Inn; and ſtole up Stairs unperceiv'd by any one but the Landlord. The <hi>Infant,</hi> finding we ſtaid longer than ordinary, began to make a great Noiſe: which my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord hearing, ſent up one of his Servants, that knew nothing of the Secret; when the <hi>Infant</hi> ſaw him come in, he made ſeveral Signs to him; but as the Fellow knew nothing of the Jeſt, he did not much like the Action of the <hi>Infant,</hi> but ran down to his Maſter frighted out of his Wits.</p>
                        <p>We had made Peep-holes in the bordering Room, where we could perceive every Action of the <hi>Infant</hi>'s; but he was ſo very much enrag'd, that he ſat down biting his Nails for Vexation; for he began to perceive the Trick we had put upon him. After ſitting Melancholy ſome time, he roſe up, and endeavour'd to undo the Chains; but as they were ty'd cloſe behind, and made faſt to a Staple in the Wall, all his Efforts prov'd vain. All our care was to contain from laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0388100100:223"/>
which was a very hard Task. When he found he could not free himſelf, Rage entirely poſſeſs'd him; and the Noiſe he made with ſtamping, and rattling his Chains, brought up ſeveral of the Servants arm'd, who open'd the Door cautiouſly; but notwithſtanding their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ran away aſſoon as they perceiv'd his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing Action; and tumbling over one another, took the ſhorteſt way down Stairs.</p>
                        <p>When we thought he had Mortification e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, we ſent my Landlord into him with a good Horſewhip, and a Letter in his Hand. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as he had got within the Door, he ſpoke after this manner, in a Landlord-like Tone. I was pretty well aſſur'd at the beginning that thou wert a rank Cheat; but now I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of it, I will chaſtiſe thee firſt, and reaſon with thee afterwards, like other criminal Judges, puniſh firſt, and enquire into the Demerits of the Cauſe afterwards, that Juſtice may not wait for any body.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Words were follow'd with ſome ſmart Strokes, and the Dialogue ſoon began to be in much Confuſion; for between the roaring of the Infant, the bawling of my Landlord, and the ſmacking of the Whip, it was a continual jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon of Noiſe: And we were obliged all of us to own, our Hoſt executed his Commiſſion to a Hair.</p>
                        <p>When he had a little recover'd himſelf, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reaſon with his Patient; who, that he might the better hear him, laid himſelf down on his Pallate to condole his afflicted Body. But their Queſtions being very long, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers but ſhort, conſiſting of two Monoſyllables, Ay, or No, I will not trouble you with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0388100100:224"/>
After their Dialogue was over, he gave him the Letter, which diſcovered our Deſign upon him. He was thunder-ſtruck at our Combination; and utter'd ſuch Imprecations of Revenge, that my Landlord was oblig'd to anſwer him with his Whip, which ſoon reduc'd him to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                        <p>We began to be tir'd with our <hi>Infant,</hi> and ſo put an end to our Diverſion, and his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by ſending him his Cloaths; tho' ſome of our Company would have had him gone to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in that Trim.</p>
                        <p>In a few Days after the Frolick was over, he commenc'd a Suit of Law againſt us all, for a Robbery; but the Judges finding it only a Trick of Mirth, fined every one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants ſix Livres a-piece, and every one to pay his own Coſts. This but enrag'd the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant</hi> the more, and he began to meditate a more pernicious Revenge; for now he appear'd the Ridicule of the whole City, and he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtir without a Train of Boys at his Heels.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Inſtance of it was as follows: My Servant having ſome Intrigue on his Hands, had made bold with my Cloaths to carry it on; and coming home pretty late, was ſhot thro' the Back with a Piſtol Ball, juſt as he was ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the College Gates. Though it was well meant, the poor Fellow eſcap'd with Life, yet he lay dangerouſly ill for ſeveral Days. He could give no Account of the Affair at all, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen the Perſon that wounded him. But the Accident made me very uneaſie, for I was convinc'd the Favour was meant to me. This made me cautious how I ventur'd out of the College; for it was eaſie to imagine it was a Proof of the <hi>Infant</hi>'s Reſentment, who had left the College upon the loſs of his Tryal.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0388100100:225"/>
I began now to repent our Confederacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and wrote him a Note to aſſure him of my Contrition, with my Share of the Money we had taken from him. He receiv'd the Caſh, and ſent me Word he heartily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave me. Imagining him ſincere, I ventur'd into the City, and ſoon frequented my old Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous; but I had ſo much Regard for my ſelf as to get to College betimes.</p>
                        <p>One Night as I was going home, four Men in Vizor Masks ruſh'd out from behind a Wall of a Houſe that was building; They all fir'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and ran away aſſoon as they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd their Pieces. I muſt confeſs, at firſt Fear made me imagine my ſelf no Man of this World: But by degrees getting over my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, I found I had not got any Hurt. This Accident to me ſeem'd prodigious; for they were all four ſo near me, that ſeveral Grains of the Powder ſtuck in my Face. But I was brought out of my Labyrinth of Thought, when I receiv'd the following Letter the next Morning.</p>
                        <floatingText type="letter">

Though this I can ſay with a clear Conſcience, I never have yet put my Trade in Practice. Yeſterday Morning I was ſent for to the Houſe of Monſieur <hi>Gomberville,</hi> commonly call'd the <hi>Infant,</hi> who employed me to take away your Life; and, that he would be ſure of the Execution, made one of the four that fir'd upon you laſt Night; but as I had the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Arms, I took care nothing ſhould be put in 'em that was hurtful. The Acquaintance I had with your noble Father, made me the more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

concerning his Son. I beg in Juſtice to me you would keep your Chamber, and cauſe it to be reported that you are dangerouſly wounded. I need not caution you to be careful of your ſelf, for the <hi>Infant</hi>'s Malice ſeems to me implacable. We never have any Words made of theſe Things, becauſe we know how to revenge our ſelves; therefore let no one elſe know the Contents of this, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for your Life from</p>

                        <p>When I had read the Letter, I order'd my Servant to bring the Bearer before me; where I ſoon found, by his manner of Talking, that a little Money would be very acceptable to the Sender; and therefore I ſent him ten Piſtoles, with my humble Service, giving him to know that I would exactly comply with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
                        <p>I began now ſeriouſly to think on the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I had inconſiderately drawn upon my ſelf, for an innocent Frolick; and that it would be but ill truſting to the <hi>Infant</hi>'s Reſentment. I gave out that I was dangerouſly wounded; and the better to carry it on, I got a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon (a Friend of mine) to viſit me frequently.</p>
                        <p>When I had kept my Chamber long enough for the time of my Cure, I ventur'd abroad, but never without four or five of my Friends for a Guard, and came home in very good Time.</p>
                        <p>During my Confinement, I receiv'd Letters of Condolement from ſeveral of my Miſtreſſes; and when they heard of my Recovery, as many of Reproach for not coming to viſit them as uſual. One in particular, and my favourite Fair, was very preſſing for a Meeting; and her chief Reaſon was to pay her with my Preſence for the Affronts ſhe had ſuſtain'd from the <hi>Infant</hi>
                           <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0388100100:227"/>
upon my Account. I ſent her Word I would not fail waiting on her the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, after Dusk. Accordingly when the time came, I ſtole out without any of the College Marks on, and arriv'd ſafe at my <hi>Madona</hi>'s.</p>
                        <p>After Supper, and two or three Bottles of <hi>Hermitage,</hi> we went to Bed; and when we had made our ſelves as merry as we could in the dark, I addreſs'd my ſelf to Sleep: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my willingneſs to receive the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle God, he ſtill flew from me, and ſeveral Hours paſs'd without cloſing my Eyes.</p>
                        <p>About Midnight, I thought I heard Whiſpers in the next Room, which very much alarm'd me: But my Fears were trebly increas'd, when, looking through a Chink of the Door, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the <hi>Infant,</hi> and four other Fellows with Masks in their Hands, ſpreading Saw-duſt on the Floor, and on the Table lay ſeveral Sacks.</p>
                        <p>I ſoon imagin'd what their Preparations meant, therefore conſulted my Safety as well as I could in the Confuſion of my Thoughts.</p>
                        <p>I went always well arm'd ſince the laſt Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, having two Brace of Piſtols in my Pockets, a good cutting Sword, and a Stilletto. But I was confounded, when ſearching for my Cloaths where I had laid them, none could be found. I now began to think of Death ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and beg Pardon ſincerely of God for all my Sins; for I knew it would be Madneſs to think of eſcaping, naked as I was, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thing for my Defnce. In the Chaos of my Thoughts I remembred a Cloſet which had a Window that look'd into the <hi>Seine;</hi> and tho' it was three Stories from the River, yet, as I could ſwim, I thought it better to truſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence by leaping into the Water, than thoſe Cut-throats. I ſtole ſoftly to the Window,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0388100100:228"/>
but to my great Conſternation found it too faſt for me to open; but by good Fortune in gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping about, I found my Cloaths. I put 'em on with a great deal of Precipitation, and having prepar'd my Arms, reſolv'd not to die alone.</p>
                        <p>I waited ſome Time before the Chamber Door open'd. When it was open, I could perceive 'em coming in with Masks on, and the foremoſt with a Dark-lanthorn. I did not think fit to wait till they ſhould diſcover I was not in the Bed, but ruſh'd on the firſt, and ſhot him dead on the Spot; and in two ſeconds of a Minute, diſpatch'd two more, one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with my Sword, and the other with one of my Piſtols; and had made as quick work with the other two, but they fell on their Knees, and begg'd for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; which I granted, on Condition that one ſhould tye the other, which was readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with; when that was done, I bound the other my ſelf, and coming to ſecure my falſe Miſtreſs, found her expiring in the Bed. She had Breath enough left to tell me, ſhe had been caught in her own Trap; for deſigning to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon me in the Wine I drank, the Servant had miſtaken the Bottle, and given it to her.</p>
                        <p>I ask'd her the Reaſon of her Hatred to me, being, as I remember'd, guilty of no Fault. She told me, the <hi>Infant</hi> had inform'd her that I was falſe to her, which converted her Love to the moſt implacable Hatred. I muſt own, this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was Miſtreſs of my Heart, and I had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proofs of her Sincerity; but ſhe was of a Temper compos'd of Fire and Fury. She fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther told me, that I had rais'd her Rage to that height, that ſhe was reſolv'd to put an end to my Life her ſelf; not caring to truſt her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to any Hands but her own.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0388100100:229"/>
She begg'd I would forgive her, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately expired. I examin'd my two intended Murderers, and found they were Servants to the <hi>Infant,</hi> and compell'd to what they did; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reſolv'd to pardon 'em.</p>
                        <p>I thought once of going to the Provoſt, and give him a particular Account of the Action; but one of the Fellows inform'd me, he was a near Relation of the <hi>Infant</hi>'s, and had a very great Love for him, which made me apprehend his Paſſion would overcome his Juſtice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reſolv'd the next Morning to ſet out for <hi>Spain,</hi> which I put in practice before Day, and gave my Man Orders to follow me.</p>
                        <p>I left <hi>Paris</hi> with this Reflection, that from the meaneſt triffling Accident, often dreadful Effects follow'd; and a Woman once provok'd was the moſt dangerous Enemy a Man could have.</p>
                        <p>I met with nothing extraordinary in my Voyage to <hi>Cales;</hi> but when I arriv'd at <hi>Sevil,</hi> I was inform'd, my Father, who was Governor of that City, was at his Country-houſe about ſix Leagues off.</p>
                        <p>Tho' I was very much fatigu'd with my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I reſolv'd to wait on him that Night. I hir'd a Mule (for I had my Servant's Cloaths on) and ſet out. But my Beaſt being none of the beſt, tir'd with me about a League before I came to the Villa where my Father reſided.</p>
                        <p>I left him in the adjacent Village, and purſu'd my Journey on Foot. As I was willing to get to my Father's Houſe, I made all the Speed I could. And tho' it was very dark, I knew the Way perfectly.</p>
                        <p>I overtook two Men in a narrow Lane, that call'd to me, asking why I had ſtay'd ſo long, and where was <hi>Don Lewis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0388100100:230"/>
I fancy'd there was ſomething of Villany go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward by the Name of Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> being he was an inveterate Enemy of my Father's. I did not anſwer 'em immediately, which brought 'em upon me; they ſoon found their Miſtake. They ask'd me where I was going at that time of Night; I told 'em I was going to <hi>Saragoza,</hi> to my Friends, for I had ſerv'd a Gentleman in <hi>Cadiz,</hi> that had diſcharg'd me, for getting his Maid with Child; and I was obliged to walk all Night, being I had not any Money to pay for a Lodging. I anſwer'd a great many other Queſtions, with the ſame Truth and Simplicity. And after talking ſome time, two more came up to us, and ask'd the others who they had got with 'em. They went all together, and after a little talk, one that ſeem'd to be the Superior, came up to me, and told me, if I would make one of their Enterprize that Night, he would not only reward me well, but take me into his Service; but if I refus'd after he had diſclos'd it to me, they would murder me upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
                        <p>I told him I would ſtick at nothing to get Bread. Why then, ſaid Sir Gravity, my Name is Don <hi>Lewis:</hi> I have a mortal hatred to <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand Aquilio,</hi> Governor of <hi>Sevil.</hi> I have waited many Years for my Revenge, but never could get an Opportunity to execute it till now. He has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd one of my Servants into his Houſe as a Domeſtic, who this Night will open the Door to us, where I ſhall quench my Hatred of him with his Blood; and further, to diſpatch all fear of Reſiſtance, I can aſſure you there are but two more Servants in the Houſe, whom my Fellow has made drunk, which ſhall be order'd ſo, as if they had murder'd their Maſter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0388100100:231"/>
It was well for me that Darkneſs cover'd the Hemiſphere, or the old Devil could have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Confuſion in my Countenance. But notwithſtanding my Conſternation, I told him I ſhould be proud to ſerve him in this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Adventure. Gramercy, ſaid the old One, and here's ſomething to encourage thee, (clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a handful of Dollars into my Hand.)</p>
                        <p>I'll leave you to gueſs the Confuſion of my Thoughts at this Declaration, and I was caſting about in my Mind, how I ſhould prevent this intended Villany.</p>
                        <p>When we arriv'd at my Father's, we found the Treacherous Villain wating for his Maſter. Aſſoon as ever he ſaw us, he cry'd ſoftly to Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> I am glad your Honour is come; but Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> is in his Cloſet, and does not intend to go to Bed to-night, becauſe he is to be at <hi>Sevil</hi> early in the Morning, and he has ſhut his Cloſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door. Why then, ſaid Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> we'll break it open. But, return'd the Servant, he has Arms always ready in his Cloſet, and I fear the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize will be a little Difficult, for he's a tough old Blade.</p>
                        <p>Upon this Account a ſmall Pauſe enſu'd, which gave me Leiſure to think, and to the Old one I utter'd my Thoughts.</p>
                        <p>Sir, ſaid I, ſubmit this Buſineſs to me, and I'll inform you how I deſign to execute it. Your Servant ſhall accompany me to the Door of his Cloſet; and knock, and aſſoon as ever he opens it, I'll give a good Account of the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                        <p>Thou counſelleſt well, reply'd the old Don, and I'll reward thee accordingly when the Work is done. And I ſhall deſerve it, thought I to my ſelf, if my Intention ſucceeds.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0388100100:232"/>
Upon this Reſolve, we went into the Houſe, and the Fellow conducted me up Stairs very ſoftly. The Cloſet was at the end of a large Room, the Door of which I bolted on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide with one Hand, and plung'd my Ponyard to the Heart of the Fellow with the other, who drop'd dead at my Feet. At the Noiſe he made in falling, my Father cry'd out Who's there! and ruſh'd out of his Cloſet, with a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol in his Hand. I reply'd, 'Tis I, your Son.</p>
                        <p>You may imagine the Surprize my Father was in at this ſudden Appearance, and to ſee one of his Servants weltring in Blood, and dead before me. Sir, ſaid I, baniſh your Surprize, and go with me into your Cloſet, where I will inform you of this ſudden, and unlook'd-for Appearance; and muſt farther add, that the Hand of Providence, by me, has ſav'd you from Death.</p>
                        <p>My Father follow'd me into his Study, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking: Where I declar'd, in as few Words as the Time would permit. all that had befallen me that Night; and we ſoon came to a Reſolution what to do.</p>
                        <p>We took each of us a Blunderbuſs with a brace of Piſtols, went down the back Stairs, and came in upon 'em, a way they little expected. I came firſt into the Hall, as we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as the old Wretch ſaw me, he cry'd, Well my Lad, haſt thou diſpatch'd the Villain! Yes Sir, ſaid I, and have drag'd him down that you may behold what I have done. When he heard that, he gave a Leap for Joy, and came running forward to view the pleaſing Sight. But Words cannot expreſs his Looks, when he ſaw my Father confronting him with a Bluderbuſs in his Hand. He ſtood motionleſs, as if he had been turn'd to Stone.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0388100100:233"/>
The other three endeavour'd to make their Eſcape, but I diſcharg'd my Blunderbuſs, and ſtopt two of them with my haſty Meſſengers. The Report of my Piece made <hi>Don Lewis</hi> fall down, as imagining himſelf ſlain; the third Perſon finding it impoſſible to eſcape, became deſperate, and like a Stag at Bay defy'd us. He pull'd out a Stilletto, and ran upon me like an angry Lyon, and notwithſtanding I ſhot him in the Breaſt with a Brace of Balls, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in three ſeveral Places; I grappling with him, we came down together upon the Body of <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> who with our Weight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cry out; and that Moment had been the laſt of my Life, if my Father had not ran to my Aſſiſtance, and with his Sword nail'd my Antagoniſt to the Pavement.</p>
                        <p>The Report of our Fire-Arms had waken'd the two drunken Servants of my Father, who came half frighten'd out of their Senſes. By this time <hi>Don Lewis</hi> had recover'd himſelf, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death before him, fell down upon his Knees, and implor'd my Father's Mercy.</p>
                        <p>Thou baſe Man! reply'd my Father, how canſt thou expect to live after thy barbarous Attempt upon his Life that never wrong'd thee? He told him he did not expect to be forgiven, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be allow'd a Prieſt, and Confeſſion, and he would die with a hearty Penitence for his Sins.</p>
                        <p>Wretch! cry'd my Father, thou may'ſt ſee how Heaven abhors thy Fact, by blaſting thy Deſign. This Man thou ſeeſt before thee, whom thou didſt employ in thy black Deſign, is my own Son, whoſe coming hither was like an Angel ſent from Heaven to my Aſſiſtance. I ſee, return'd the <hi>Don,</hi> the Seal of Providence is upon you, and I heartily repent the Crime I
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0388100100:234"/>
intended to commit: And if you will forgive me, and forget what is paſt, I'll eſteem you as the Saver of my Life; and, to unite our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I'll match my Daughter with a noble Dowry to this your Son, and may they ever live happy.</p>
                        <p>My Father was too much a Gentleman to murder in cold Blood, though he had ſufficient Excuſe on his ſide if he had done it. On the other hand, his Daughter was a very great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, even beyond his Hopes.</p>
                        <p>After ſome ſmall Pauſe, he made him this Reply. Sir, you know within your ſelf, that you have forfeited your Life by the Law, in ſo baſely attempting mine; but as I can forgive any Injury deſign'd me, if you perform your firſt Promiſe, I am reſolv'd to forgive all that's paſt. Sir, reply'd the other (tranſported with Joy) I am ſo much oblig'd to you for my Life, that I will not ſtir out of your Houſe till I have ſign'd Articles of Agreement; and I muſt farther add, that nothing ſets my Shame more before my Eyes than this your Goodneſs.</p>
                        <p>My Father begg'd he would take a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Care how he gave way to Hatred; which, by the way, only commenc'd in my Father's getting the better of him in a Law-Suit, and was heighten'd by the King's conferring on him the Honour of the Government of <hi>Sevil,</hi> which <hi>Don Lovis</hi> had ſome Hopes of.</p>
                        <p>We took care the next Day to let the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try know, that thoſe Fellows that were kill'd had attempted to rob our Houſe, but we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving timely Notice had prevented 'em by their Deaths.</p>
                        <p>The old Gentleman was as good as his Word, for Articles of Agreement were drawn up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0388100100:235"/>
'em, and I had Leave to viſit the Lady when I thought fit. But I was obliged to go back to <hi>Sevil,</hi> to put my ſelf in an Equipage ſuitable to the Occaſion, and <hi>Don Lewis</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd after with his Daughter.</p>
                        <p>I muſt confeſs I was charm'd with her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the firſt Interview; and the Day was fix'd for our Nuptials, which rejoic'd the whole City of <hi>Sevil,</hi> that two of the nobleſt Houſes were going to bury in Oblivion their long En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                        <p>I took the Privilege of an intended Husband in my Viſits to my deſign'd Bride, and in her Converſation found ſhe had no Averſion for me, (at leaſt I thought ſo,) and I promis'd my ſelf the utmoſt Felicity in her Enjoyment.</p>
                        <p>One Morning, about a Week before the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Wedding, I came early to wait on her, but was inform'd ſhe was not come out of her Chamber: therefore I reſolv'd to take a Walk in the great Piazza of the City, to give her time to dreſs her ſelf; but as I was going out, I obſerv'd the Maid to my Miſtreſs conferring with a Country Fellow; the Sight of me, I obſerv'd, gave the Woman ſome Confuſion. My Heart told me I was concern'd in their Interview, therefore I went to the Corner of the Street, and waited till their Dialogue was over; which did not keep me long, for the Fellow ſoon parted with the Woman, and went out of the Gate that leads to <hi>Cordova.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I had my Man with me, whom I acquainted with my Fears, ordering him to dog the Fellow, and get out of him, by fair Means or foul, his Buſineſs at <hi>Don Lewis</hi>'s Houſe, and I would follow after him on Horſe-back.</p>
                        <p>Away ran my Man, and I ſoon got my Horſe, and overtook 'em about a League and a half
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0388100100:236"/>
from <hi>Sevil.</hi> When my Man got Sight of me, I obſerv'd he took a little Basket from the Countryman, and ran away over the Fields with it. I fancy'd by that he had ſucceeded in his Commiſſion, ſo turn'd my Horſe and follow'd him.</p>
                        <p>When I had overtaken him, we went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a Tuft of Trees a little out of the Road, where he told me he had made the Fellow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was ſent by <hi>Tereſa</hi> (the Name of the Maid he was conferring with) to give him No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that he would be purſu'd by a Cavalier, and forc'd to deliver what he had receiv'd from her, and perhaps be in Danger of loſing his Life; and that he had Orders to conſult with him for his Safety.</p>
                        <p>The Countryman, being none of the wiſeſt, ſoon diſcovered the whole Affair to my Man, and at Sight of me deliver'd the Basket to him, and ran to a publick Houſe in the next Village, to wait till he could get clear of me, where my Man was to bring him his Basket again. In the Basket were four Melons, and in one of them we found a Letter very artificially put up, which I took out, and with Terror of Mind read the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, which were as follows.</p>

And what prompted me the more to it, was, a Poſtſcript to her Letter, wherein ſhe bad him come in his uſual Diſguiſe, and in the dark. In order to the Accompliſhment of my Deſign, I went into a neighbouring Houſe, and wrote the following Letter, which was put in the Melon in the Room of the other.</p>

                        <p>Now all the Hopes I had were, that the Fellow knew what Diſguiſe this amorous Spark wore, and where was the Place of Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
                        <p>I left it all to my Servant, who had Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enough to outwit twenty of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman. After I had deliver'd him his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I went back to <hi>Sevil,</hi> full of Hopes and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0388100100:238"/>
Fears; and in two Hours my Man arriv'd: He gave me a Deſcription of his Converſe with the Countryman, (which was diverting enough) and how happy they were in eſcaping my Hands.</p>
                        <p>He inform'd me, the amorous Gallant came diſguis'd in the Habit of a Peaſant, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through the back Garden of <hi>Don Lewis</hi>'s Houſe by the Maid, who always attended the Hour, and convey'd him to her Apartment in the Dark; which was according to my Wiſh: and by Deſcription of the Spark's Perſon, we were not unlike as to Proportion or Age, and Darkneſs would conceal the reſt.</p>
                        <p>I ſoon provided my ſelf of the Habit I was to wear, and impatiently expected the coming Hour, which came at laſt, though the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening ones ſeem'd the longeſt of my Life.</p>
                        <p>I did not wait long before I was admitted by the too-faithful Confident. We went over the Garden to a ſmall Room at the Entrance of the Houſe, where I ſoon diſcover'd my falſe Fair-one, (tho' in the dark.) She was undreſs'd, and diſincumber'd of every Lett to Enjoyment. I found, by her eager Kiſſes and Embraces, there was no Parlying requir'd; ſo I e'en fell to and fed very heartily; my Partner in Pleaſure ſeem'd to like what was prepar'd for her; and, before we parted, gave me to underſtand I had done Wonders, and much beyond her Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>When we had dally'd away about four Hours in our Feaſting, the Maid came to tell me it was time to part, which we did, after ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Morſel.</p>
                        <p>I went immediately home, was ſoon in Bed, and had no want of any Provocative to Sleep.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0388100100:239"/>
When I aroſe in the Morning, I began to weigh maturely the laſt Night's Adventure; but could come to no Reſolution as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming my Behaviour to my falſe Miſtreſs: But I reſolv'd to be determin'd by hers.</p>
                        <p>I went to viſit her about Noon, and found her more than ordinary civil to me.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, I was ſo charm'd with the Sight of her, that I reſolv'd to give her another Viſit in my Diſguiſe the ſame Night; and all I had to do was to be firſt at the Place.</p>
                        <p>When the Time came, my Conductreſs was as ready as before; but going ſoftly in, ſhe clapt to the Door a little too haſtily, and faſten'd my Coat in't; and to give me the more Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ſhe the ſame Moment dropt the Key out of her Hand; and though I could ſee where it lay, yet I could not ſtoop for it, becauſe my Coat was ſecur'd in the Door.</p>
                        <p>After groping about ſome time, ſhe took it up, and open'd the Door to releaſe her Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: But on the very Inſtant my Rival appear'd, and, finding himſelf there before he came, ruſh'd in, and faſten'd upon me.</p>
                        <p>The Maid, at the Sight of two <hi>Sofia's,</hi> clapt to the Door in a Fright, and ran ſcreaming away; ſo we had the Happineſs to be lock'd in the Garden together. But however, to make the beſt of a bad Market, (as the Saying is,) I got my Rival down, and belabour'd him with my Fiſts; for, as good Fortune would have it, we had neither of us any offenſive Weapons.</p>
                        <p>The Noiſe of the Maid, and our buſtling, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſtiff that was Watchman to the Houſe, who, without ſaying <hi>By your Leave,</hi> had the Impudence to faſten upon my Rival by the Arm, and worry'd him very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely: But, notwithſtanding my Reaſons to the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0388100100:240"/>
contrary, I took Pity of him, and by Force of Arms deſtroy'd the Dog; that is, I held him ſo faſt about the Throat with my Hands, that his laſt Breath flew away in a Huff.</p>
                        <p>My diſguis'd Spark ſeeing himſelf ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly reliev'd, gave me Thanks for his Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and, aſſoon as ever he ſpoke, (for we had been ſullen before, neither of us having open'd our Lips) I knew him by his Tongue to be one of my particular Acquaintance.</p>
                        <p>Why how now, <hi>Don Juan!</hi> ſaid I, how came you thus diſguis'd? Nay, reply'd the <hi>Don,</hi> I ought to ask you the ſame thing. With ſeveral Queſtions and Anſwers we came to a right Underſtanding. If I had known, ſaid he, your Pretenſions here, I ſhould never have made any Attempts to your Prejudice. Come, come, ſaid I, it's very well as it is. So we turn'd that to Mirth and Ridicule, which perhaps others of our Nation would have turn'd to Blood. Our next thing was to make our Eſcape, for the whole Houſe was alarm'd, and coming upon us with their domeſtick Weapons, as Pokers, Spits, Fire-ſhovels, &amp;c. My Companion led me to a Place of the Garden, where the Wall was ſomething lower than any where elſe; and juſt as we had gain'd the Aſcent, we perceiv'd a Man mounting from the other Side; but my Friend did him the Favour to tumble him down again; he quickly got up, and ran upon him moſt furiouſly with his Poniard, and gave him ſeveral Stabs; but my Friend clos'd with him, wreſted his Weapon from him, and ſtabb'd him to the Heart.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as he was ſped, we made off; but did not go far before my Companion dropt down dead of his Wounds. I was very much griev'd at the Accident, but made the beſt of my way
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0388100100:241"/>
home, for fear I ſhould come into Trouble about it, if I was caught near the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                        <p>I went to Bed, but very much perplex'd in Mind, and had no Reſt all Night. But what was my Grief in the Morning, when my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant brought me Word, my Father and <hi>Don Juan</hi> my Friend were found murder'd, in the Habits of Peaſants, under <hi>Don Lewis</hi>'s Garden-Wall! The Relation depriv'd me of the Uſe of Speech for ſome time, and my Reaſon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook me. I was more than once going to put an End to my Life, and had certainly done it if I had not been prevented by my faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. But when my Reaſon return'd again, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of the Adventure with ſome Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for though I had all the Grief imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Loſs of ſo good a Father, yet I was of a Temper not to grieve long at any thing; and then the Fortune I thought my ſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of, appear'd ſo lovely to me, that it ſoon dry'd up my Tears.</p>
                        <p>The City imagin'd my Father came by his Death through <hi>Don Lewis</hi>'s Means, as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the antient Enmity of the two Houſes; and being found ſo near his Houſe, ſtrengthen'd the Opinion of every Body; and I was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſon ſatisfy'd to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>The Servants that brought in my Father's Body, gave me ſeveral Papers found in his Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets; among which were two Letters that partly let me into the Truth of this unhappy Adventure. The firſt was to this Purpoſe;</p>

                        <p>BE at the Weſt End of the Garden at one in the Morning, and aſcend a Ladder of Rope you will find there, and bring it over with you; near the Corner you'll perceive an Arbour, go in there, and wait till I come to conduct you to your Wiſhes. I'll take care nothing ſhall be in your way to interrupt your Privacy; and be ſure you be careful of your Tongue, for if you ſpeak, we ſhall be both undone.</p>
                        <p>My Thoughts were in the utmoſt Confuſion about the unravelling of this fatal Affair; and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over in my Imagination my paſt Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations with my Father, I remember'd in our laſt, he told me, he thought it a little of the ſooneſt for me to marry; and that it would be more for my Intereſt, to delay our Nuptials; and perhaps, ſaid he, I may give you ſufficient Reaſons for the contrary. Whatever his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were, I little thought of the true one.</p>
                        <p>I ſent a Letter to the Maid of my falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; but ſhe fearing ſhe ſhould be found out (as ſhe really was) abſconded.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Lewis</hi> ſent to condole with me in my great Loſs; but I could perceive it gave him ſome Satisfaction, that I was in actual Poſſeſſion of that Eſtate, which I had only Hopes of in the Life of my Father. His Viſit was but ſhort, yet I thought it too long; for as I had no Deſign of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0388100100:243"/>
marrying the Daughter, I was very willing to drop my Acquaintance with the Father. Tho' I gave him Hopes, when Decency would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I would not fail in my Addreſſes to his Daughter.</p>
                        <p>After the Interment of my Father, I began to examine his Affairs, and was not very well pleas'd to find the beſt Part of his Eſtate mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd for twelve Years to ſeveral Perſons; and inſtead of ſeeing my ſelf worth twenty thouſand Crowns a Year, ſoon found I was not worth the ſixth Part.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed, that my Father was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe in his way of Living, always keeping open Houſe; yet it was every body's Opinion he did not expend half his Income.</p>
                        <p>I ſometimes imagin'd there was ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand Dealing in the Affair, but it was paſt my finding out: I therefore took an odd Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, I determin'd with my ſelf to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a voluntary Baniſhment, till the term of Years on the Mortgage was expir'd.</p>
                        <p>I made a Viſit to <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> and told him of my Reſolves, and my Reaſons for it, which he could not chuſe but applaud; for it was eaſy enough to perceive Intereſt was the Jack he aim'd at. He did not preſs me to ſee his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor I him; but after Aſſurance of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancing on both ſides, we parted.</p>
                        <p>I muſt own, my Soul long'd for another Taſte of the delicious Banquet; and I hope you will excuſe me when I own to you, my Paſſion could not be call'd Love; but as I found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, I made my ſelf as eaſy as I could.</p>
                        <p>In a few Weeks I had finiſh'd my Affairs, and waited for the ſailing of the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Fleet; reſolving for the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> where I had an Uncle very rich, who had often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0388100100:244"/>
in his Letters to my Father, the great Deſire he had to ſee me.</p>
                        <p>I had rais'd out of the Ruins of my Father's Fortune ſix thouſand Crowns, without ſo much as touching any of his Plate, or Furniture; the care of thoſe Things, with all my Writings, I truſted to a near Kinſman, Superior of a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the City.</p>
                        <p>One Day, going about two Leagues out of Town, my Horſe's Girt broke, which obliged me to a light at a Sadler's to have it made good. The Man ask'd me if I would not take a walk in his Garden while he was doing his Work, which I accordingly did.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the Walk was a pretty Arbour, and in it ſat a Woman reading; who at the Sight of me, gave a great Shriek, and was for running out; but I ſtopp'd her, and begging Pardon for diſturbing her, told her I would retire, and leave her alone. But upon finding it was <hi>Tereſa,</hi> Maid to my quondam Miſtreſs, I reſolv'd to ſtay with her, that I might know ſomething of my Father's Affair.</p>
                        <p>She appear'd confounded at the Sight of me, is imagining I had come on purpoſe to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend her; but I ſoon undeceiv'd her, and with a little ſoothing Language, and a couple of Piſtoles, ſhe diſpos'd her ſelf to give me all the information ſhe could.</p>
                        <p>Sir, (ſaid ſhe) I hope you will pardon me; for what I did, was purely by the Influence of Gold.</p>
                        <p>Your Father declar'd to me, at firſt Sight of my Miſtreſs his Heart and Reaſon forſook him; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0388100100:245"/>
often declar'd he would break off the Match between you; for he was well aſſur'd you had no very violent Inclination for her, and there were other Women in <hi>Sevil,</hi> of as great a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as my Miſtreſs, that would be proud of his Alliance.</p>
                        <p>The many rich Preſents he made me, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came my Honeſty; and that unfortunate Night that brought him his Death, was to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated his Happineſs. But, ſaid ſhe, (after ſome Pauſe) I am very much at a loſs to find out one thing. What's that, Madam? ſaid I. Why, Sir, return'd <hi>Madona,</hi> ſince I know how Matters ſtand between you and my Miſtreſs, I ſhall give you to underſtand, that you were not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd Lover; and that another Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd in thoſe Delights, you perhaps thought to have the whole Poſſeſſion of; and that was the Reaſon I was ſo willing to comply with your Father, for I had intended to introduce him in the Habit of the ſaid Gentleman, unknown to my Miſtreſs, and had provided a Story accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. For aſſoon as ever the Gentleman was gone, your Father ſhould have taken his Place in the ſame Diſguiſe; and I intended to impoſe on my Miſtreſs, that her Lover was return'd to take another Farewel of her. And this Cheat was eaſy to be carry'd on, being they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Silence, old <hi>Don Louis</hi> lodging in the next Room. But what amazes me, (as I was ſaying) opening the Door to let my Miſtreſs's Lover in, another in the ſame Diſguiſe ruſh'd in upon me, which I am ſure was not your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſoon clear'd up this Affair with her, and let her know how I had ſupplanted my Rival.</p>
                        <p>She ſeem'd very much ſurpriz'd at the unravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this Secret, but was very glad ſhe had nothing to apprehend from my Reſentments; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0388100100:246"/>
that was the chief Cauſe of leaving her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, as imagining I ſhould find the Letters ſhe had ſent him. And upon this ſhe reſolv'd to go to her Miſtreſs again, for ſhe heard every Day from the Family, and knew how Matters ſtood; and that her Miſtreſs wanted her, that they might condole together for the loſs of <hi>Don Juan,</hi> her old Spark. But ſhe declar'd, ſhe was not very ſorry for his Loſs, for Mony came very hard from him; and you know Sir, ſaid ſhe, it is our Buſineſs to make Hay while the Sun ſhines.</p>
                        <p>Madam, ſaid I, ſince I know what you love beſt, if you'll purſue my Intrigue, twenty Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoles are at your Service. Indeed, Sir, return'd Madam, it muſt be ſomething very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary that I ſhall refuſe for ſuch a Sum. Why then I'll let you into my Plot, ſaid I; you ſhall inform your Miſtreſs <hi>Don Juan</hi> is not Dead, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; but after a tedious and dangerous Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was recover'd to a Miracle, but conceal'd his Revival, being under ſome Apprehenſion of anſwering for the Life of my Father.</p>
                        <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, I like your Plot ſo well that I'll anſwer for the Succeſs on't, and I'll go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it inſtantly, for I long to be fingering the Gold. Why then, ſaid I, you ſhall finger it before-hand, and when the Buſineſs is done, I'll double the Sum. She was mightily pleas'd with the Amendment to the Bargain; and the third Night after was concluded on for the Time, when I was to attend as before.</p>
                        <p>I took leave of <hi>Tereſa,</hi> and purſu'd my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, made merry with my Friends, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd.</p>
                        <p>At length the happy Moment came, that I ſo long expected. My mercenary Confident was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; I enter'd, and once more took Poſſeſſion of all my Treaſure; and as I thought it would be the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0388100100:247"/>
laſt time, was profuſe enough. My Lady ſeem'd very well pleas'd with my Night's Work, and in plain Terms told me ſo.</p>
                        <p>I had prepar'd a Letter, in which I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd every thing. When our loving Affair was over, ſhe ask'd me ſoftly how I was engaged in that Adventure. I told her as ſoftly as I could, that I knew ſhe would be inquiſitive, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being dangerous, I had brought the Account in Writing, which I put into her Hand, and with ſome regret took my Leave; for the next Day was intended for our Imbarkation. As I walk'd over the Garden, I ask'd <hi>Tereſa,</hi> how long the Amour had been between <hi>Don Juan</hi> and her Lady; ſhe told me about two Years, and this was the Commencement.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Juan,</hi> whoſe Country-houſe lay about two Leagues from my Maſter's, was ſet upon by Thieves, and dangerouſly wounded; and there had loſt his Life, if <hi>Don Lewis</hi> had not very fortunately for him come that Way at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and drove off the Thieves. <hi>Don Juan</hi> was ſo very much hurt, that it was not thought ſafe to carry him home; therefore my Maſter order'd him to his Houſe, where his Wounds kept him a great while. When he had recover'd Strength enough to walk, he uſually employ'd his time in the Garden, where my Lady often ſeeing him, fell deſperately in Love with him. She made me the Confident of her infant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and I being a very proper Perſon to be truſted with ſuch Secrets, advis'd her to let the <hi>Don</hi> ſee her, which we contriv'd thus.</p>
                        <p>She was to go into an Arbour at the farther end of the Garden, (where I had obſerv'd <hi>Don Juan</hi> ſat every Day) and pretend to be aſleep. She took all the care that was neceſſary in her Dreſs, and did as I directed her. It ſucceeded
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0388100100:248"/>
to her Wiſh; for the <hi>Don,</hi> at Sight of her, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining her an earthly Goddeſs, kneel'd and kiſs'd her Hand. She ſeem'd to wake in a pretended Fright, but it was not long before they came to a right Underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>That Place was made the Rendezvous of the Lovers, when Opportunity would permit; but he recovering (tho' he pretended a Weakneſs for ſome time) was obliged to take leave of our Houſe; tho' in the Father's Abſence, they often found Opportunity to ſatisfy their Loves; and when they reſided in Town, he continu'd his Viſits in the Diſguiſe of the Countryman he us'd to ſend to my Lady with Preſents of Fruit, and by that means they received Letters from each other.</p>
                        <p>When ſhe had finiſh'd her ſhort Relation, I gave her the tewnty Piſtoles I promis'd her, and took my Leave. She ſeem'd to be in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion about managing it with her Miſtreſs, for ſhe would certainly find her out, ſhe ſaid, when ſhe would be confirm'd of <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s Death; but ſhe comforted her ſelf with telling me, her Miſtreſs durſt not diſcloſe it to any body, for fear of betraying herſelf. But poor <hi>Tereſa</hi> little thought her Miſtreſs would find it out ſo ſoon as the next Morning, when ſhe had read my Letter, that I put into her Hand, when I left her. The next Day, I order'd my Equipage on board our Ship, which lay at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd my ſelf; but the Wind chopping about, hinder'd our ſetting Sail. I then repented the leaving my Letter with my Miſtreſs, for by the help of my Money with <hi>Tereſa,</hi> I might have made another Meal with her.</p>
                        <p>I old not think it Prudence to go on Shore, fearing her Reſentments might form ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns on my Life. I therefore contented my ſelf
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0388100100:249"/>
on Board, till the Wind ſhould prove fair for ſailing. As I was reading in my Cabin one Day alone, my Servant brought me a Letter: The Contents were theſe.</p>

My Father was a rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of that City, who going to another World, has left me a conſiderable Eſtate in this. Thoſe Perſons who had the care of my Education here, ſeem to have Deſigns againſt my Fortune; therefore I have made my Eſcape from 'em, but muſt return to my Betrayers, if you have not the Goodneſs to be my Guardian to <hi>Mexico,</hi> where I ſhall return the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation you ſhall pleaſe to lay me under, in being my Protector.</p>

                        <p>I ask'd my Man who brought the Letter, and he told me a young Negro. I bid him bring him in. I ask'd him ſeveral Queſtions, and found him ready with his Anſwers. He inform'd me, that his Father, tho' a Negro, was a Man of Subſtance, and had ſent him in his Infancy to be educated at <hi>Sevil,</hi> and for the reſt the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform'd me.</p>
                        <p>I was mightily pleas'd with the Perſon of the black Gentleman, and treated him civilly, with the Aſſurance of delivering him ſafe to his Friends at <hi>Mexico.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When we were alone, he told me he had a farther Secret to diſcover to me, if he was ſure of not being interrupted. Upon hearing this, I order'd my Servant on Shore for ſome Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and inform'd him, we need not fear any Interruption for ſome Hours.</p>

After a long Pauſe, and caſting his Eyes on the Ground, he began.</p>
                        <p>This Veil of Night would not hide my Bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if I were not convinc'd in your Knowledge of my Frailty. But if you'll conſider my Youth, Climate, and Opportunity, you will allow few of my Sex could withſtand the Temptation. Be not ſurpriz'd to find in this Diſguiſe the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> who is ſo far ſubject to the caprice of Love, as to diſcloſe to you the inmoſt Secret of her Heart.</p>
                        <p>The Letter you left with me produc'd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Effect than I believe you imagin'd; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Rage and Indignation taking Poſſeſſion of my Breaſt, a ſofter Paſſion ſtole in, and I felt all the Tenderneſs imaginable for <hi>Don Pedro.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I expect nothing but ill Uſage from you for my paſt Conduct; but if you can believe there is any Sincerity in Woman, after what I have been guilty of, I am aſſur'd you may depend on what I ſay, that no other Object ſhall ſhare my Heart with you. I do not mean the tye of Wedlock, but if you will accept of me as I am, I'll be as ſubſervient to your Commands, as your meaneſt Slave.</p>
                        <p>I was ſo confounded between Pleaſure and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, that I imagin'd all I heard and ſaw was a Dream; but being ſweetly convinc'd of the Reality, I ſaid all my Paſſion could ſuggeſt in return, not giving my ſelf time to conſider of the Oddneſs of the Accident: 'Twas ſufficient I had in Poſſeſſion all that was lovely in Woman, in my Imagination; and I had no other Thought, but how to keep her from the Knowledge of her Father on Shore, and the Sailors on Board, for we did not know when we ſhould ſet Sail.</p>

                           <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0388100100:251"/>
My Miſtreſs told me, if ſhe had not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, ſhe reſolv'd for a Nunnery, but ſince we were reconciled, ſhe had laid by all Thoughts of the Habit. She made her Eſcape from her Father's, without the Aſſiſtance, or Knowledge of any one but <hi>Tereſa.</hi> But what favour'd her Eſcape was, the Abſence of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ten Days in the Country; yet ſhe fear'd, when he came home again, he would fright <hi>Tereſa</hi> into Conſeſſion, or by Promiſes get it out of her; for that ſhe was mercenary enough to ſell any thing ſhe had to the beſt Bidder. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, we agreed to dreſs her in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Man, and let her wear her own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly we both went on Shore at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz,</hi> and ſoon equipt our ſelves with what we wanted, and on Board I brought my Spark, as a Relation of mine, that had a Mind to run his Fortune with me. The next Day the Wind proving favourable, we ſet Sail, and left our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions behind us.</p>
                        <p>I was obliged to let our Servant into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, that I might have it kept ſo; well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he had diſcover'd it himſelf, it had not been a Secret long, tho' the Fellow was very faithful to any Secret that was truſted to him.</p>
                        <p>We touch'd at the <hi>Madera</hi> Iſlands, paſs'd the Pike of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> got over the Line, duck'd our Men as uſual, and met with no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Accident; but in fifty three Days, arriv'd ſafe at the City of <hi>Sancta Domingo,</hi> (or St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick)</hi> the capital City of the Iſland <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I was very well pleas'd to find ſo delightful a Place as this was, after the Fatigue of our Voyage. My Miſtreſs and I took us a Lodging at a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s, that treated us very well—for our Money.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0388100100:252"/>
Here my Lady told me, ſhe felt the Effects of our Familiarity. I endeavour'd to perſuade her I had no Hand in't; but ſhe inſiſted upon't, that the Deed was done by me, and gave me ſome Proofs to believe it.</p>
                        <p>I was very much concern'd to find Means to hide it from the Houſe; for ſhe began to have thoſe Qualms which attend that natural Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and by the Beauty of her Face, I fear'd her Sex might ſoon be diſtinguiſh'd.</p>
                        <p>I kept her from the Sight of our Ship's Crew in the Voyage, ſhe always ſtaying in the Cabin; and it was very dangerous to diſcover a fine Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this Part of the World, becauſe there are few that are handſome.</p>
                        <p>I was upon Thorns till our Departure for <hi>Mexico;</hi> but the Fleet ſtaying longer than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, I took a Ramble to the moſt noted Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Iſland; and ſince I underſtand by your Story you never were there, I'll give you a ſhort Deſcription of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> is ſeated from ſeventeen Degrees, to nineteen Degrees Latitude, in Length about one hundred and twenty Leagues; and Breadth (about the middle Part) fifty. The Air much the ſame for Heat, as at <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> the Fruits delicious, and ſome peculiar to the Place.</p>
                        <p>The capital City, is St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> which gives a delightful Proſpect from the Fields about it, being mix'd with pleaſant Gardens and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                        <p>Here the Governor of the Iſland reſides, and here are kept all their Offices, and Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, and it is likewiſe the Store-houſe to the whole Iſland.</p>
                        <p>There are two Cities more, St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and <hi>Nue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra Sennora de alta Gracia;</hi> the laſt of which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0388100100:253"/>
is to the South, and is famous for the beſt Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate in the World.</p>
                        <p>The Cathedral of St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> is a handſome Pile of Building, and the other Churches are anſwerable to the Grandeur of the Inhabitants, whoſe very Artizans are wealthy.</p>
                        <p>The Fryers live as luxurious here, as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part of the World, and follow the Steps of their Brethren, in chuſing the nobleſt Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>This Iſland was diſcover'd by <hi>Columbus</hi> in the Year 1492, and kept in the Hands of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> ever ſince that Time; while moſt of their other Acquiſitions are fell to the <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Tho' the <hi>French</hi> have ſome Plantations in the Iſland at preſent, yet they were of their own acquiring, and not taken from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and being chiefly Hunters, and not very rich, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make no Attempt upon 'em.</p>
                        <p>No Iſland can boaſt of more convenient Ports than this, and every Port diſembogues fine Rivers (ſtor'd with palatable Fiſh) into the Sea; but then to qualify that Bleſſing, they are very much infeſted with Aligators, and Crocodiles. I ſaw one lying on the Shore-ſide like a Log of Wood, and as a Buffalo came there to drink, he ſprung upon him, dragg'd him to the Bottom, and there devour'd him; tho' they are eaſily to be avoided, from the aromatic Smell that comes from their Skin.</p>
                        <p>I was much ſurpriz'd to find in moſt Houſes, Serpents inſtead of Cats, that were greater Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Rats and Mice; but what was more pleaſing, they were not the leaſt Offenſive, having no Venom in 'em. But then, they will often play the Fox with the Poultry, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy many of them, unleſs narrowly watched.</p>
                        <p>

The <hi>Scolopendria</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is found here, and very large Scorpions; but by the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, neither of 'em hurtful.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not trouble you with any farther Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Iſland, becauſe there is not any thing to be found there, but what is upon the Continent, unleſs ſome particular Herbs; and as I am no Botaniſt, I ſhall not take any notice of 'em.</p>
                        <p>The time came at laſt for our embarking for <hi>Vera Cruz,</hi> in order to go to <hi>Mexico,</hi> and I left St. <hi>Domingo</hi> with ſome Regret; as imagining I ſhould not meet with any other Place in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> ſo pleaſant.</p>
                        <p>During our Voyage, my Miſtreſs was mightily diſorder'd.</p>
                        <p>We embark'd for <hi>Vera Cruz,</hi> where we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd without any Accident; and having no Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there, we ſet out by Land for <hi>Mexico,</hi> and got ſafe there. But enquiring for my Uncle, I was inform'd he was gone to reſide at <hi>Lima,</hi> the capital City of <hi>Peru.</hi> My Concern was the more, in that I fear'd I ſhould not meet with proper Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation at <hi>Mexico,</hi> for want of him, in the Affair of my Miſtreſs; for her Condition would not bear the Fatigue of another Removal.</p>
                        <p>I was entertain'd in the Houſe of a near Friend of my Uncle's, and one who kept a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him; he was very civil to me, and of a freer Diſpoſition than generally the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are; but he had the ſame Vanity as all the old Chriſtians have, who Pride themſelves very much upon't. I let him into the Secret of my Lady, and her Condition; and by the help of his Wife, we made her reaſſume her proper Dreſs. But we kept her private.</p>
                        <p>The time of her Delivery came, and the Product prov'd a luſty Boy, who ſtaid among us three
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0388100100:255"/>
Weeks, and then left us. I had no Scruples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout being the Father, for it was plain enough to be ſeen; it being my Picture in a little. My Miſtreſs continu'd very weak longer than the uſual Time; and I being alone with her one Day, ſhe told me ſhe was under ſome Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning our Landlord, Don <hi>Manuel,</hi> who had made her ſecretly many large Offers, and the Nurſe was his Emiſſary. I told her I had the ſame Propoſals from his Wife; and tho' the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was not diſagreeable, nay might paſs for a Beauty, where Women were ſo ſcarce, yet I could not find any Tenderneſs for her in my Heart.</p>
                        <p>After many Arguments between us, a Thought came into my Head, which I hop'd would produce ſome Mirth among us. I deſir'd my Miſtreſs to give Don <hi>Manuel</hi> ſome ſmall Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and leave the reſt to me.</p>
                        <p>My Landlord ſoon found an Opportunity, thro' my means, to ſee my Miſtreſs. She fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd my Advice, and tranſported the <hi>Don</hi> out of his Senſes; his Joy was not to be contain'd, he forgot the Gravity of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and caper'd about like a <hi>French</hi> Dancing-maſter. When I learnt all their Diſcourſe from my Miſtreſs, I begg'd her to continue her good Humour to him, and promiſe him a meeting that Day Seven-night in the Summer-houſe of the Garden. She did as I directed.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time I took my Opportunity to confabulate with the Wife, and gave her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections the Night appointed, to go to the ſame Summer-houſe, but to avoid Speech, being it was over the Water, and Men were continually paſſing to and fro. The good Woman was as much overjoy'd as her Husband; and the better to carry on my Deſign, I gave it out, that I was
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0388100100:256"/>
to go with ſome Gentlemen a hunting the Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falo for two or three Days. I deſir'd my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord (a Title I had given him out of Mirth) to take care of my Wife in my Abſence. I told my good Landlady, this was a Contrivance of mine, that we might not be ſuſpected.</p>
                        <p>My Miſtreſs had made juſt the ſame Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the <hi>Don.</hi> The Time came, and the good Man and good Woman were left to worry one another, with their extraordinary Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p>The next Day at Dinner, (for we generally eat together) Don <hi>Manuel</hi> caſt many a Sheep's Eye at my Wife, and his good Lady at me.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Day, as I was reading in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Madona</hi> came to me, and in bitter terms of Reproach gave me. much ill Language; and told me I had betray'd her to her Husband baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by giving him the Ring ſhe gave me the laſt Night. I ſoon found that ſhe had made a Preſent to her Husband of a Ring, taking him for me, and ſhe had obſerv'd it upon his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. She made ſo many Speeches about it, that at laſt I was compell'd to tell her the whole Truth, to get rid of her tireſome Paſſion, but I ſoon repented of my Declaration; for ſhe flew upon me, and with her Nails play'd the Cat with my Face, and I had much ado to diſengage my ſelf from her. So furious does a diſappointed Paſſion make a Woman.</p>
                        <p>Her confounded Temper made me reſolve to leave <hi>Mexico.</hi> The Husband began to ſuſpect ſomething of the Affair; but his Imagination, that he had the Company of my Wiſe in the Summer-houſe, curb'd his Reſentment.</p>
                        <p>The Woman's Rage was unſurmountable, and it was not in my Power to bring her to Temper: Therefore I choſe to avoid her as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0388100100:257"/>
As I was at Supper with my Miſtreſs, ſome few Days after the Accident happen'd, ſhe told me, ſhe had receiv'd a Preſent of Cordial-water from Don <hi>Manuel</hi>'s Wife. Now I had not told her of <hi>Madona</hi>'s Reſentment, becauſe I imagin'd it might make her uneaſy: But aſſoon as I heard of the Preſent, ſomething ſtruck my Mind, there was ſomething uncommon in it; I therefore deſir'd my Miſtreſs not to drink any of it. Lord ſaid ſhe, my Dear, I have already, and deſire you would taſte it too, for 'tis the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt Liquor I ever drank in my Life.</p>
                        <p>I was mightily diſturb'd at it, and two Hours diſcover'd the fatal Effects.</p>
                        <p>My Miſtreſs began to be very much out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and notwithſtanding all the Aid of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, ſhe expir'd in my Arms, and every body agreed ſhe had been poiſon'd. I had, in my Fury and Ravings, declar'd to Don <hi>Manuel</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this black Deed; and when he went to enquire after her, was inform'd ſhe went out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Night, and was ſuppos'd to have gone to the Town of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> on the Lake, to one of her Relations. Don <hi>Manuel</hi> ſent after her, but ſhe was not to be found. He grieved at the loſs of my Miſtreſs, as much as I did; and I dare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow, if he had found his Wife, he would have ſacrific'd her to the <hi>Manes</hi> of my dear Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>I was very much griev'd for the Loſs of my Miſtreſs, for I had reaſon to be convinc'd her Paſſion for me was unfeign'd. You may eaſily imagine, there was no ſtaying for me in the Houſe where this diſmal Accident happen'd; but as I was preparing to be gone, the <hi>Corrigidore</hi> ſent for me to appear before him, to give him the beſt Account I could of this Action. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him the whole Truth, as I have told it
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0388100100:258"/>
you; only I declar'd it was my Wife I had loſt. Don <hi>Manuel</hi> was ſeiz'd, and put in Priſon, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I inſiſted upon his Innocency; but he proceeded in that manner, being it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd he was acceſſary to his Wife's Eſcape. But a few Days after he was ſecur'd, News was brought, that his Wife was found murder'd in the Woods, as it was ſuppos'd by ſome <hi>Indians,</hi> as ſhe was endeavouring to make her Eſcape from the Hands of Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>Thus ſhe met her Reward for her barbarous Murder of a Woman that never wrong'd her, tho' indeed the Favour was deſign'd for me.</p>
                        <p>A few Days after this fatal Accident, I heard of ſome Merchants that deſign'd to croſs the Continent to the <hi>South Sea</hi> with a good Guard. I made Acquaintance with 'em, paid my Quota to the Charge, and ſet out along with 'em, leaving behind me the hateful City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> where I had loſt the only thing I eſteem'd on Earth. And I muſt own to you, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Philoſophy, I never thought of her for ſome time without the utmoſt Heart-breaking. I have endeavour'd indeed, by forcing my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Mirth, to bury the Remembrance; and Time, with good Company, has brought me ſome Aſſiſtance; yet nevertheleſs, I do firmly believe, no Woman's Charms will ever for the future break my Reſt; for I am ſatisfy'd, my late Miſtreſs made a Hole quite through my Heart.</p>
                        <p>But to purſue my Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>We ſet out, with a Guard of fifty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for fear of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who had made it their daily Practice to ſet upon every body that went through the Country, if not too ſtrong for 'em. I need not tell you, that <hi>Mexico</hi> is one of the fineſt Cities in the World, or that it lies
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0388100100:259"/>
upon a Lake, and no other Paſſage to it but over three broad Cauſways from different Cities on the Land. But what is ſomething extraordinary, one part of the Lake is brackiſh, and noiſome, with no living Creature in't; and the other is freſh, wholſome, and ſtor'd with palatable Fiſh. But as there are many exact Accounts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of <hi>America,</hi> and its Conqueſt, by my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Countryman <hi>Hernando Cortes,</hi> I ſhall ſay no more of it; but I will take the Liberty to add that <hi>Caeſar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> were but Pigmy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors to him; and every body will be of that Opinion, if they will give themſelves the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reading his Hiſtory.</p>
                        <p>We met with no <hi>Indians</hi> to oppoſe our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and arriv'd at <hi>Segovia,</hi> an inland Town in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd with Rocks, and but meanly built. Some of our Company ſtaid there, and I was willing to ſtay along with 'em to refreſh my ſelf; for it's but indifferent travelling over rocky Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and croſſing Rivers upon Hurdles, that is Pieces of Timber laſh'd together with Ropes; and it is ſometimes dangerous, tho' we got over ſafe with our whole Company.</p>
                        <p>I ſtaid fifteen Days at <hi>Segovia,</hi> with fifteen of my Companions. I was very much ſurpriz'd at the Relation of ſome of the Inhabitants of that Place, who told me, about two hundred of your Countrymen the Year before (Free-booters) in ſpight of all Oppoſition came from the <hi>South Sea,</hi> to the <hi>North,</hi> with a very great Booty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the <hi>Spaniards</hi> when ten to one, and poſted to all the Advantage in the World, ſeveral times. The People of <hi>Segovia</hi> talk of 'em as ſo many Devils; and that they were aided by the black Gentleman, or it had been an Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to have gone through what they did. But
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0388100100:260"/>
it muſt be confeſs'd, your Countrymen deſpiſe Hazards, and laugh at the greateſt Dangers.</p>
                        <p>After we had ſufficiently refreſh'd our ſelves, we took our Leaves of <hi>Segovia,</hi> and purſu'd our Journey to the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> with a Guard of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> ſubſervient to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And I muſt own to you, there is not a People in the World more true to their Truſt, than thoſe confederate <hi>Indians</hi> that own the Dominion of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our Journey to St. <hi>Fee</hi> was pleaſant enough, through a rich, level, pleaſant Country, and we rode upon Mules, a Beaſt of a ſure Foot; and our chief Diverſion was ſhooting of Monkies, that play'd us ſeveral comical Tricks, running up the Trees, and frequently did us the Favour to urine in our Faces, and ſometimes ſomething worſe.</p>
                        <p>When we arriv'd at St. <hi>Fee,</hi> a ſmall Town and Port in the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> we had the good Fortune of meeting with a Veſſel ready to ſet Sail for <hi>Lima.</hi> We went immediately on Board, and got clear of the Shore that Evening.</p>
                        <p>We arriv'd at <hi>Lima</hi> after a Voyage of twenty five Days; we landed at <hi>Calao,</hi> the Port that all the Ships of <hi>Spain</hi> anchor at, and one of the fineſt in the <hi>South-Sea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Town is built upon a Point of Land that runs into the Sea. It is very ſtrongly fortify'd, and well garriſon'd. I ſent my Servant to my Uncle at <hi>Lima,</hi> to acquaint him that I was coming to wait on him the next Day; but my Servant return'd in four Hours, with my Uncle's Coach, who inform'd me, that he was impatient till he ſaw me. My Uncle was Judge of the Civil Courts, and a Man in very great Power. He ſent his <hi>Major Domo</hi> to wait on me, with his Excuſe, that he had come himſelf, but that he was afflicted with the Gout. I only ſtaid
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0388100100:261"/>
till I had put on other Cloaths, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after went in the Coach with the <hi>Major Domo,</hi> and arriv'd at my Uncle's juſt within Night. He was very well pleas'd to ſee me, and careſs'd me in an extraordinary manner. But I was ſomething ſurpriz'd to find that he had reſolv'd for <hi>Spain</hi> within a Month, there to end his Days.</p>
                        <p>I told him the Story of my Father's unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Fate, only concealing his Love to <hi>Donna Elvira.</hi> He was very much ſhock'd at the News, owning to me his chief Reaſon of going to <hi>Spain,</hi> was to have the Happineſs of living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I then told him, I ſuppos'd as that could not be, that he would alter his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and think no more of his Voyage: But he anſwer'd, moſt of his Effects were gone for <hi>Spain</hi> two Months before, and that he muſt of neceſſity follow.</p>
                        <p>I gave him to underſtand, that it was not in my Power to wait upon him. He took a great deal of Pains to perſuade me to it, but when he found it was to no purpoſe, he told me ſince I was not to be prevail'd upon, he would leave me Maſter of a ſmall Fortune in <hi>Lima.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>During his Stay, he introduc'd me to moſt of the beſt Families in the City, and the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy was pleas'd to ſhow me good Countenance, and promis'd my Uncle to provide for me.</p>
                        <p>When the time came of his embarking for <hi>Spain,</hi> I waited on him on Board, where we took Leave, though not with dry Eyes; and I have repented many times that I did not accompany him. But we muſt ſubmit to Fate; and what is allotted us by Fortune will come.</p>
                        <p>He left me Maſter of a well-furniſh'd Houſe, and a Plantation whoſe Income would provide
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0388100100:262"/>
every thing Neceſſity requir'd in the middle Station of Life, with a Promiſe that at his Death I ſhould inherit the Remainder of his Eſtate; for he was a ſingle Man, and had no nearer Relation than my ſelf.</p>
                        <p>I took all the Pleaſure the Place would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; and to ſay Truth there was no want of any thing at <hi>Lima,</hi> except the Converſation of the Female Sex; though I muſt freely confeſs I did not always want that.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy prov'd very kind to me, but Death taking him away ſuddenly, I mightily griev'd his Loſs, as indeed I had Reaſon; for the Perſon that ſucceeded him prov'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. He made a general Remove of all the Officers the Deceas'd had put in Poſts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt I was one of the Sufferers; and farther, upon all Occaſions he made it his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to ſlight me; and often affronted me ſo groſly, that nothing but his Dignity ſhrouded him from my Reſentment: and many other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Power, (as the Injudicious generally co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the Frailties of their Superiors, and neglect their Virtues) treated me in the ſame Manner; but I was reſolv'd not to bear it.</p>
                        <p>One Day as I was coming from my Plantation upon my Mule, attended only with my old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, I met a Nephew of the Viceroy's in his Chaiſe, in a narrow Road, and not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give way to him, we were both at a Stand; which ſo enrag'd the cholerick Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he flew out of his Vehicle, and ran his Spado into the Belly of my Mule, which dropt down dead.</p>
                        <p>I did not want ſo much Provocation to raiſe my Choler, therefore I drew upon him, and left him in the ſame Condition with my Beaſt, grov'ling upon the Sand. He had ſeveral Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0388100100:263"/>
that attended him, who ruſh'd upon me and my Man, overpower'd us, and dragg'd us immediately to the Viceroy's Palace; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad of any Pretence to wreak his Ill-nature upon me, condemn'd me to <hi>Baldivia</hi> for Life, in ſpite of the Interceſſion of thoſe few Friends I had.</p>
                        <p>It was in vain to complain of this damn'd Trick of Fortune; and the more to plague me, he left Orders that I ſhould be diſpos'd of to <hi>Don Sancho Ramires,</hi> a Relation of his; the Wretch that I have ſufficiently reveng'd my ſelf of, and, in part, of the inhumane Viceroy; for they were Partners in Trade.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ramires</hi> us'd to put me upon the moſt ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Buſineſs, but as I had Money I uſually bought it off; for I receiv'd yearly my ſmall Eſtate from <hi>Lima,</hi> I mean from my Plantation, for the Viceroy had ſeiz'd all the reſt of my Moveables; and would have done this, but that the honeſt <hi>Indian</hi> who had the occupying of it, inſiſted on its being my Uncle's.</p>
                        <p>This old Hunks had a beautiful Daughter, that I found was in Love with a Colonel of the Garriſon of <hi>Baldivia.</hi> This Colonel, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my Condition, was not aſham'd of my Acquaintance, and often told me the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he endur'd for the young Lady.</p>
                        <p>I ask'd him if the Lady knew of his Paſſion; he inform'd me that he flatter'd himſelf with the Return, though they had never ſpoke to each other, but he had receiv'd obliging Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from her fair Eyes, from the Gallery which overlook'd the Court of Guard.</p>
                        <p>I agreed that if he would write a Letter, I'd pawn my Life ſhe ſhould have it, and an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer into the Bargain; if ſhe had any Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſend one. He embrac'd me, and thank'd
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0388100100:264"/>
me for my kind Proffer, and wrote a paſſionate Letter to the Lady; which I accompanied with another, to let her know I was devoted to her Service upon the Colonel's Account.</p>
                        <p>In two Days I had an Anſwer convey'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a hollow Tree in the Garden, as I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed in my Note to her, that waited upon the Colonel's.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Paper Meſſengers brought Matters to bear, and the kind Lady reſolv'd to venture her ſelf with the Colonel.</p>
                        <p>We contriv'd a Ladder of Ropes long enough to reach from her Window to the Terras on the Court of Guard; and I convey'd a ſmall Bundle of Packthread for her to throw down, which we faſten'd to the Ladder of Ropes, and the Lady with much Difficulty pull'd it up, and faſten'd to an Iron Cheſt which was in the Room: But as ſhe came trembling for Fear down the Ladder, it drew the Cheſt along the Floor above, which awaken'd that old Devil her Father. He immediately alarm'd all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as well as Slaves; but the Captain had got ſafe off with his Miſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>When old Huncks had ſummon'd us all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he went into the Room to ſee what the Matter was; but when he found his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſafe, his Diſtraction began to abate. I muſt own, I wiſh'd heartily we could have clear'd his Money too, as well as his Daughter. It was ſome time ere he miſs'd her, as having no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Elopement; but when he found ſhe was gone, his Paſſion was unſurmountable; for the good Lady had made bold with Writings of an Eſtate, that it ſeems were left her by an old Aunt; and I was very well pleas'd ſhe did not go empty-handed to my Colonel; for I take Money to be the Sinews of Love as well as War.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0388100100:265"/>
The inrag'd <hi>Don</hi> ran up and down like a Madman, with about a dozen of us at his Heels; and as we approach'd the Ditch of the Caſtle, which happen'd to be free from Water, being the Tide was out, but pretty well provided with Mud, ſome of his Servants imagin'd they ſaw ſomething lie on the Mud. The old <hi>Don</hi> being very peery, was ſtooping down and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to be ſatisfy'd; and the Devil prompting me juſt at the ſame time, I clapt my Knee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Bum, and down fell the poor <hi>Don</hi> into the Mud.</p>
                        <p>I was the firſt that cry'd out for Help, yet I did not make extraordinary Haſte to aſſiſt him; but at laſt Ropes were brought, and after he had flounder'd about a Quarter of an Hour, we lugg'd him up in a ſweet Pickle.</p>
                        <p>By good Luck, he did not miſtruſt that the Favour was deſign'd him, but purely acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. I had an Opportunity the next Day to find out the Lady and the happy Colonel, who had brought a Commiſſion from the Prieſt to go to Bed together. He was ſo well pleas'd with my Service, that he promis'd to ranſom me from <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and did not doubt but he ſhould ſucceed, being the <hi>Don</hi> made Money his <hi>Summum Bonum.</hi> But we were ſurpriz'd at the Refuſal, for he had ſuch a ſtrict Charge from the Viceroy of <hi>Peru</hi> to hold me faſt, that it was more his Intereſt to keep me than part with me. Nay this Propoſal open'd the old <hi>Don</hi>'s Eyes, for he ſaw plainly I was at Bottom of his Daughter's Affair. This ſo enrag'd him that he order'd a great wooden Clog to be lock'd faſt to my Leg, which I was oblig'd to lug along with me.</p>
                        <p>This Proceeding drove me almoſt to Deſpair, and I loſt all Hopes of ever procuring my Liberty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0388100100:266"/>
The Colonel and his Lady (who had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Fortune from <hi>Don Sancho)</hi> were very much griev'd at my ill Uſage, and try'd all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Means for my Liberty, but to no purpoſe. I paſt three Years in this uncomfortable Life, and had the Pleaſure to hear that my implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemy, the Viceroy of <hi>Peru,</hi> was ſummon'd to <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the Account of ſome Male-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. At the hearing of this News my Hope of Freedom began to revive, but it was ſoon clouded again; for the old Devil, <hi>Don San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> was reſolv'd to keep me a Martyr to his own Revenge; and I weather'd out two Years more in my wretched Confinement: Though, Thanks to Heaven, nothing depreſs'd my Spirits quite.</p>
                        <p>The Colonel got an Opportunity to tell me that there was a Veſſel in the Road bound for <hi>Lima:</hi> and the Captain being a very good Friend of his, he had prevailed with him to take me on Board him, if it was poſſible for me to get out of Hunks's Clutches.</p>
                        <p>I made all the Efforts imaginable, but to no purpoſe; and I was once more in my Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given up to eternal Slavery.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Night, as I was endeavouring to compoſe my troubled Thoughts, I heard a great Noiſe in the Caſtle-Yard, and was very much ſurpriz'd a while after, when I ſaw an Officer and a File of Soldiers come to ſeize me, as a Plotter againſt the State, and carry'd me to the Colonel's Lodging. But my Surprize was turn'd into Joy, when I found he had us'd this Stratagem to gain me my Freedom. I told him he had trebly repaid the Obligation he was pleas'd to ſay he lay under to me, and I was reſolv'd not to accept of my Liberty till I found what Stir <hi>Don Sancho</hi> made about it: but the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0388100100:267"/>
Colonel reſolv'd me that he had the Means in his own Hands to pacify him.</p>
                        <p>I went on Board, and ſet Sail the ſame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We had but an indifferent Voyage, being involv'd in many Storms; yet at laſt we arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Calao.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſhall, if you think fit, give you a ſhort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Baldivia,</hi> becauſe few Foreigners are permitted to enter their Port.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Baldivia,</hi> or <hi>Valdivia,</hi> takes its Name from the firſt Founder, a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The old Town ſtood a little higher than the new one, till it was deſtroy'd by the <hi>Indians.</hi> For <hi>Peter Baldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were ſuch Tyrants over the poor Natives, that they took Heart, laid an Ambuſh for 'em, and deſtroy'd 'em every one. But in the new Town they are ſufficiently guarded from their Inſults, or Danger of a foreign Enemy; which have often attempted 'em to no Purpoſe. This being reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd the richeſt Country for Gold Mines in all <hi>America,</hi> Nature has befriended 'em very much in the Strength of the Place; for there is ſo large a Sand-Bank in the Mouth of the Bay, that Veſſels are obliged to come within five hundred Yards of the Shore (which is guarded by a ſtrong Caſtle) to avoid it. It is a difficult Harbour to enter, but when you are once at Anchor, no Wind on the whole Compaſs can hurt you, tho' it blew a Storm; it is ſo well ſhelter'd by the Land on all Sides of it.</p>
                        <p>The Inhabitants are chiefly made up of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Perſons, who generally work in the Mines for ſo many Years; and the Time expir'd, they have ſo much Land of their own to cultivate; and moſt of them find the Means to be rich; but how honeſtly I'll give you leave to judge. The Country about it is very fruitful, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0388100100:268"/>
produces great Quantities of Apple Trees, from which they make very good Cyder. But the Juice of the Grape is very uncomatible there, and thoſe that do procure it muſt pay extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly for it.</p>
                        <p>This City, for it's no leſs, is eſteem'd the Key to the <hi>South-Sea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Governour and Officers are generally ſent from <hi>Lima,</hi> but the Soldiers are compos'd of thoſe Perſons that are ſent there for a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And tho' few Perſons chuſe to be ſent there, yet as few deſire to leave it when once they are ſettled.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding the People could make ſhift to live without Religion, yet there are ſeven Churches and three Monaſteries; but they ſeem to be in a ruinated Condition: And I don't doubt but an Age or two hence, thoſe that paſs that Way may find them totally ruined.</p>
                        <p>As I ſaid, we arriv'd ſafe at the Port of <hi>Calao.</hi> I was reſolv'd to remain <hi>incognito,</hi> till I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd into the Affairs of the City.</p>
                        <p>I took an Occaſion to ſend to my <hi>Indian</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, who came to me, and was very well pleas'd to find me at Liberty.</p>
                        <p>I ſent him to ſeveral of my Friends, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them what Circumſtance I lay under, who ſoon inform'd the Viceroy of my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and he as readily comply'd with my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, allowing me the Liberty I had enjoy'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was ſent to <hi>Baldivia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I once more made my Appearance at <hi>Lima,</hi> renew'd my Acquaintance, and began to divert my ſelf as before. By degrees I crept into the good Graces of the Viceroy, who gave me a Poſt in the Government, that brought me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Income; and with the Eſteem of moſt People I paſt on a whole Year.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0388100100:269"/>
The Viceroy not liking his Situation, found the Means to be recall'd to <hi>Spain:</hi> Yet recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending me to his Succeſſor, I remain'd in the ſame Station he before had given me; though I cannot brag of any more Favours beſtow'd on me by my new Superior; for he was a Man of an uncertain Temper, proud, and revengeful. He was newly marry'd to a very rich Widow of <hi>Lima,</hi> who had a very beautiful Daughter, by Report; for ſhe was not ſuffer'd to take the Liberties of the Place.</p>
                        <p>I often had a great Deſire to ſee her Face, for I had obſerv'd her veil'd many times at Church, which was all the Liberty ſhe had. I was in form'd ſhe was deſign'd a Wife for the <hi>Supreme Judge,</hi> though much againſt her Inclination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was a Diſparity of Years, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greateſt Bitter to the Sweets of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony; but nothing is conſulted now more than Wealth.</p>
                        <p>I receiv'd a Letter from my Uncle at <hi>Sevil,</hi> wherein he deſir'd I would leave <hi>Lima,</hi> and come to <hi>Spain:</hi> And, to induce me to it, he gave me the Promiſe to make me his Heir. I muſt own I began to be pretty well tir'd of this Climate; and the Time drawing on for the Expiration of my Mortgage, I ſet my ſelf to prepare things accordingly.</p>
                        <p>I diſpos'd of my Plantation to my faithful <hi>Indian,</hi> for an under Price, being I thought I was under many Obligations to him. I reſign'd up my Office in the Viceroy's Palace, indeed, becauſe I could not get Leave to diſpoſe of it.</p>
                        <p>I turn'd all my Effects into Gold-Duſt, and ſent it before me to my Uncle; and now I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waited for Company to go over Land to <hi>Vera Cruz,</hi> a Port in the North Sea, where I ſhould have Convenience of imbarking for <hi>Spain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0388100100:270"/>
I began now to think of ſettling in the World; and indeed it was almoſt time, for I had paſt my twenty-eighth Year, and at that Age the Heat of Youth ſhould be pretty well over; for if a Man cannot ſee his Follies on this ſide thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he is in Danger of being incorrigible all the Days of his Life. Beſide, I had very good Encouragement to Stability, my own Fortune, and the Proſpect of my Uncle's; who in all Probability had not many Years to live, being in his eighty-third Year.</p>
                        <p>Well then, as my Story is almoſt off the Stage, I'll throw you into the Bargain a ſhort Account of one Place more, for my Cataſtrophe, and then to my Epilogue for detaining you ſo long, and that ſhall be the Deſcription of <hi>Lima,</hi> as it is at preſent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lima,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Peru,</hi> is ſeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Leagues from the Sea-Port of <hi>Callao,</hi> in 12 Degrees 6 Minutes of Southern Latitude, and 79 Degrees 45 Minutes of Weſtern Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude. It is built in a noble Plain, with Hills at a Diſtance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Francis Pizarro</hi> was the Founder, in the Year 1535, tho' it has chang'd its Name ſince his Time, from <hi>La Ciudad de los Reges,</hi> or <hi>City of Kings,</hi> to <hi>Lima,</hi> which is only a Corruption of the <hi>Indian</hi> Word <hi>Rimac,</hi> which was the Name of an <hi>Indian</hi> Idol, formerly worſhip'd in that Place.</p>
                        <p>This is the fineſt City (next to <hi>Mexico)</hi> in all <hi>America.</hi> All the Streets are in a direct Line, exactly meaſur'd out, and much of the ſame Length and Breadth, being fifty Yards wide.</p>
                        <p>In the Heart of the City is the nobleſt Square my Eyes ever beheld, and in the midſt a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Braſs, adorn'd with eight Lions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſpouting Water, ſupply'd by the River
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0388100100:271"/>
of <hi>Lima,</hi> that runs through the Skirts of the Town, cover'd with a handſome Stone Bridge that leads to the Suburbs. Within the Suburbs is a fine publick Walk, beautify'd with Orange Trees, and in the Evening is crowded with the beſt Company of the City. Although this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſo beautiful, it was moſtly deſtroy'd by an Earthquake in the Year 1682. There are no leſs than fifty-ſeven Churches and Chappels (with thoſe that are in the Monaſteries) in this City, and twenty-four Monaſteries for Men, and twelve for Women. The Cathedral is very magnificent, as are moſt of the other Churches, tho' chiefly built with Wood from the firſt Story, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Earthquakes.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy of <hi>Peru</hi> has his Reſidence here, and is ſo powerful he hardly owns the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be his Superior. Here are likewiſe kept all the Courts of Juſtice, and from the High Court there is no Appeal. Among the reſt, they have ſettled an <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which, on my Conſcience, is worſe than that of <hi>Spain.</hi> Heaven keep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body from it; for in this Court the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant is a Witneſs, and the Accuſer is ever behind the Curtain, and to mend the Matter, the Witneſſes are never brought Face to Face.</p>
                        <p>To compleat the Grandeur of the Place, there is an Archbiſhoprick, and an Univerſity of three well-fill'd Colleges; tho' the Students don't al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follow Learning, for I have found ſome ignorant enough.</p>
                        <p>There are twelve Hoſpitals, and one of them for <hi>Indians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This City is garriſon'd with two thouſand Horſe, and ſix thouſand Foot; but very indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Troops for Service againſt a foreign Foe, being chiefly compos'd of <hi>Creolians</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> Theſe <hi>Creolians</hi> (who are ſo nam'd from owing
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0388100100:272"/>
their Birth to <hi>America)</hi> are moſt of 'em proud, lazy, and ignorant, and generally Tyrants when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have Power, tho' ſharp enough as to Trade, and will over-reach you if they can.</p>
                        <p>They are all inclin'd to Venery, and will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice every thing to gratify that Vice. The Women (who are really very handſome) gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſit at home all Day croſs-leg'd, and as mute as Fiſhes; but at Night it is cuſtomary for 'em to haunt the Streets veil'd, and will as hardly be refus'd a Favour, as the Men with us on the like Occaſion.</p>
                        <p>As I was ſitting one Evening in my Lodging, diſpatching ſome Letters for <hi>Spain,</hi> I heard ſome body knock ſoftly at my Door. My Servant was gone abroad, and therefore I aroſe and open'd it my ſelf, but was ſurpriz'd to ſee a Lady veil'd, who, without making any Words, came in and ſat down on a Couch. After ſhe had repos'd her ſelf ſome time, ſhe unveil'd, and diſcover'd to me one of the ſweeteſt Faces I had ever ſeen. I was almoſt turn'd into Stone at the Sight of ſo much Beauty, and was ready to fall down to worſhip her as a Divinity. Said ſhe, I come not here to be gaz'd at; I like you, and if you can do the ſame by me, I believe you will not uſe me ill.</p>
                        <p>Madam, I return'd, I know no other way to convince you that I like you, but one. With that I took her into an Alcove, where we ſoon came to a right Underſtanding. Aſſoon as our ſmall Matter of Buſineſs was over, ſhe deſir'd to be diſmiſs'd, yet with a Promiſe to give me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Viſit the next Evening; but, ſaid ſhe, if you ſhould chance by any Accident to ſee me in any other Place, take your Eyes from the Object, for fear of Danger; for thoſe Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Soul often betray their Truſt.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0388100100:273"/>
I promis'd to obſerve her Directions, and left her, but yet could not help my Curioſity; for when ſhe was got down Stairs, I put on my Cloak, follow'd her, and obſerv'd ſhe want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Viceroy's Palace. I was convinc'd, by the Dreſs ſhe wore, that ſhe was none of the common Sort; and much diverted I was at the Accident.</p>
                        <p>The next Day ſhe did me the Favour of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Viſit, when we paſs'd our time as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly as we could; and my <hi>Incognita</hi> ſeem'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much pleas'd with my Company.</p>
                        <p>After our Toying was over, ſhe told me ſhe was afraid of loſing me, for ſhe had heard I deſign'd for <hi>Spain.</hi> I inform'd her, nothing had Power to ſtop me, but the Paſſion I had for her.</p>
                        <p>She at laſt diſcover'd herſelf to me: She was Daughter-in-Law to the Viceroy: She told me that ſhe had reſpected me a great while, and had many Diſputes with her Honour and Love; but the former was forc'd to give way to the latter. She likewiſe let me know of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Marriage, and added that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my Perſon would make her Averſion to her Husband the ſtronger. We had many Meetings, to the Content of us both; and ſhe made me ſeveral Preſents of Jewels, which I intend to keep for her ſake, having preſerv'd them thro' all my Fortunes. Our Meetings now began to be leſs frequent, being the Wedding-Day was fix'd, which gave me a great deal of Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. To divert my Melancholy, I uſually took a Walk in the Orange-Grove, where, in my muſing Fits, I often ſtay'd longer than uſual.</p>
                        <p>As I was going home one Evening, I heard the Claſhing of Swords at a Diſtance, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after ſaw a Perſon running towards
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0388100100:274"/>
me, who cry'd, For the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſake, if you are a Gentleman, lend me your Sword, to defend my ſelf againſt a Villain who has offer'd me the vileſt indignity. I made him no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but gave him my Sword (for he look'd like a Man of Quality) and follow'd him.</p>
                        <p>Juſt as I turn'd the Corner I ſaw him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, and his Antagoniſt drop down dead.</p>
                        <p>The Gentleman ſeeing that, took to his Heels.</p>
                        <p>The Street being alarm'd with the Buſtle, as I came near the Body, I was ſeiz'd as the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. What ſtrengthen'd their Opinion, and I muſt confeſs had but an indifferent Look, was my Sword remaining in the Body of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd. All my Aſſeverations of Innocence ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd nothing: I was carried before the <hi>Corrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore;</hi> but having no Witneſſes of my aſſaulting him, and one Fellow by good Fortune proving I was not the Perſon that engag'd him firſt, I was only once more condemn'd to <hi>Baldivia.</hi> I curs'd my hard Stars a thouſand times, and the Grief of parting from my Miſtreſs was like to rid me of Life; but Time began to wear it off.</p>
                        <p>I was ſecured in the Caſtle of the City till the Veſſel was ready to ſail.</p>
                        <p>While I was confin'd, in order to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>Baldivia,</hi> a Gentleman came into the Priſon, and begg'd half an Hour's Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with me. I had been ſo liberal to the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with my Money, and pretty jovial in my Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that I believe if I had ask'd him to let me go, he would not have deney'd me; ſo that I begg'd the Favour to admit the Gentleman, and his Abſence, during our Confabulation. He obey'd me in both, and the Gentleman enter'd my Room; which, though but mean, was the beſt in the Priſon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0388100100:275"/>
Aſſoon as the Gentleman had repos'd himſelf upon a Chair, (none of the beſt) he ask'd me if I would pleaſe to refreſh my ſelf with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing the Place afforded: But I anſwering in the negative, he made half a dozen Humms and Haws, and open'd his Mouth to utter Senſe.</p>
                        <p>Sir, ſaid he, you ſee before you the unhappy Perſon that is the occaſion of your Confinement. I ſhould not be thus free with you, if I were not aſſur'd of your generous Good-nature. Once more I muſt tell you, you ſee before you the unhappy Man who is guilty of that Fact you are to ſuffer for. I am a Gentleman by Birth; and tho' I had not the good Fortune to owe my firſt Being to old <hi>Spain,</hi> yet I have this for my Conſolation, that my Parents were born at <hi>Cordova</hi> there; but the Frowns of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune driving them to this part of the World, grew aſham'd of her ill Looks, and greeted 'em with Smiles of Favour. In a few Years, <hi>Plutus</hi> the God of Wealth made 'em a Viſit, and took his Leave of 'em with a Promiſe of his frequent Return; and he prov'd as good as his Word, for in a little time Fortune became a neuter Gender, that is, believing they did not want her Aſſiſtance, they were no more her Devotees.</p>
                        <p>Sir, ſaid I, the ſooner you will pleaſe to come to plain <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> the ſooner I ſhall be in the ready Road to your Buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>Why then, ſaid he, not to keep you in Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, I am the Perſon that was oblig'd to you for your Sword on ſuch a Time, which prov'd the Inſtrument of my Revenge on a baſe Wretch, that deſerv'd an Eternity of Torments after this Life, for wronging the beſt of Women. And ſince I find you love the ſhorteſt way, without the tedious outward Flouriſhes of Rhetorick, I
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0388100100:276"/>
will inform you of my Story, with as much Brevity as I am capable of.</p>
                        <p>My Mother dy'd about ſeven Years ſince, and I may very juſtly ſay the reſt of my Father's Life was a Delirium; but Death taking Pity of his Griefs, came to his Aid, and about two Years ago I was left Maſter of a plentiful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                        <p>As Death is the End of all things, and Age muſt pay its Tribute to him, I ſhook off my Grief for my Father's Loſs; and in ſix Months after his deceaſe, fell in Love with a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of an incomparable Beauty, at leaſt in my Eye. My Fortune gave me eaſy Acceſs to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Fair, and when I had the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of converſing with the Object of my Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſhe did not ſeem averſe to my Paſſion. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing concurring to my Deſires, <hi>Hymen</hi> join'd thoſe Hands whoſe Hearts were united before.</p>
                        <p>For ſeveral Days we revell'd in the Sweets of Love; and I may juſtly ſay, Poſſeſſion had not the Power to pall Deſire; each Moment of Enjoyment ſeem'd new, and my utmoſt Wiſh was center'd in her Breaſt: But the dire Fiend, tormenting Jealouſy, at laſt crept in, and pall'd my Appetite to ardent Love; the fatal Bitter to our mutual Sweets.</p>
                        <p>I had a Perſon that I call'd my Friend, who ſhar'd the Affluence of Fortune with me: We had the ſame Deſire to Love and Hate: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought I was but poorly bleſt till my Friend ſaw the Idol of my Soul. But oh! what Pangs that fatal Moment coſt me! His Eyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Bane to all his Peace, and in one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment render'd up his Heart. I gave him Leave (for what could I refuſe to ſuch a Friend?) to viſit my Wife, when Buſineſs demanded my
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0388100100:277"/>
Abſence. He often declared his Paſſion to her, by plaintive Sighs and languiſhing Looks. When my Wife perceiv'd he importun'd her too far with his Love, ſhe threaten'd to tell me of it; but in the mean time he had acquainted me with what had paſs'd between him and my Wife. Said he, My Friend, I imagin'd your Wife was like other Women, prone to change, therefore in your Abſence I counterfeited a Paſſion for her, to ſee whether ſhe had that Regard ſhe ought to have for you, and I am pleas'd to find you have made ſo worthy a Choice.</p>
                        <p>I muſt own to you I was mightily pleas'd with this Tryal of my Friend, as believing it ſprang from his Kindneſs to me; and I had much to do to reconcile my Wife to his Viſits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She would often ſay, I wiſh your Friend be ſincere in his Profeſſions to you; for my part, I greatly doubt it.</p>
                        <p>In a little time after this Accident, I perceiv'd my Friend began to look very melancholy; I endeavour'd to ſift the Secret from him, but to no manner of Purpoſe for ſome time.</p>
                        <p>One Day, as we were riding out to take the Air together, he ſeem'd more deeply plung'd in Sorrow than uſual. I told him, I ſhould not take him for my Friend any longer, if he did not let me into the Cauſe of his Diſorder. At laſt, with much Reluctance, he told me that the good Opinion he had before conceiv'd of my Wife was falſe, for he was well aſſur'd ſhe was not true to my Bed.</p>
                        <p>You muſt imagine what a Thunder-clap this muſt be to me, from a Friend who I was aſſur'd in my ſelf would not relate a Falſehood. It was ſome Moments before I could open my Mouth; and all the time of my Silence, he ſeem'd ſo much griev'd that he had declar'd the Secret to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0388100100:278"/>
me, that I had no Doubt of the Truth of it.</p>
                        <p>When my Grief had given me Liberty of Speech, I begg'd he would give me the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Suſpicion; but he deſir'd to be excus'd till he had certain Proof of her Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, which he did not doubt but he ſhould ſoon have, tho' it was what he wiſh'd to be deceiv'd in: And farther added, he would not have me take any Notice of it, but carry it fair to her, as if nothing had happen'd; for if you ſhould, ſaid he, you'll never come to the truth of the Matter.</p>
                        <p>I promis'd to comply with him, and went home; but Heaven knows with what a Heart.</p>
                        <p>I follow'd my Friend's Advice punctually, but yet could not help ſhowing the Diſcontent of my Mind in my Countenance. My Wife was mightily concern'd for my Melancholy, and was very preſſing to know the Cauſe; and in a very tender manner ſeem'd to be diſquieted, which I took all for Art, and the Cunning of her Sex.</p>
                        <p>I muſt own to you, that ſometimes I imagin'd my Friend had deceiv'd me; but whenever we had an Opportunity of converſing, he ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd my Jealouſy to ſuch a degree, that I began to wiſh the Cauſe of it no longer in this World. And if it had not been for my revenging my ſelf on the ſuppos'd Partner of her Guilt, I had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly taken Methods to diſpatch her hence.</p>
                        <p>I had ſome Affairs to tranſact at <hi>Segovia</hi> every Year; and the time drawing on for my Journey, my Friend told me, before my Return I ſhould have Demonſtration of her Infidelity; for, ſaid he, your Abſence will give her the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhe wants, and ſhe'll be ſure to take hold of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0388100100:279"/>
It was a great while before I could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon by my Friend, to undertake really this Journey, but only to feign as if I had, that I might be convinc'd of her Perfidy, and puniſh it my ſelf; but my Friend laid me down ſo many Reaſons for it, that I at laſt very unwillingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to go. But in the mean time, ſaid he, you muſt order that I may have Admittance in your Abſence, that I may take my Opportunity to obſerve all Paſſages. Why, ſaid I, I never knew you debarr'd the Liberty of my Houſe. But you know, ſaid he, ſince my falſe Declaration of Love, to try your Wife's Virtue, ſhe has look'd upon me more like an Enemy than Friend, as knowing I was not ſincere in my Paſſion; for Women, be they ever ſo vicious, yet they abhor the Man that doubts their Virtue. Well then, ſaid I, if you will, we'll ſup together to-night; and then I'll take an Opportunity to leave Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections with my faithleſs Wife, to allow you the ſame Privileges in my Abſence, as you now have. Why then, return'd my Friend, don't you be ſurpriz'd at what I ſhall ſay to her.</p>
                        <p>We parted, and went to prepare every thing for my intended Journey. When I was at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with my Wife, I gave her ſome Hints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Friend, and that I deſir'd he ſhould have Admittance in my Abſence; I obſerv'd ſhe chang'd Colour at my Diſcourſe, and ſeem'd to be in the utmoſt Confuſion, altho' I did not ſeem to ſee it.</p>
                        <p>After ſome Talk about indifferent Matters, ſhe told me, if I thought fit, ſhe intended to live private in my Abſence, and admit of no Viſitors. For Sir, ſaid ſhe, the World will be cenſorious, and receiving Viſits from a Man, when you are from Home, is not conſiſting with our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cuſtoms. She found by my Diſcourſe that I was
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0388100100:280"/>
determin'd it ſhould be ſo, wherefore ſhe left off arguing upon that Subject: but I could perceive all the time we were together, my Reſolves ſat very uneaſy upon her; and it was with much Difficulty ſhe reſtrain'd her Tears. Her Sorrow ſtruck me to the Heart, and it was the greateſt ſtruggle I ever went through to keep my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: For I imagin'd all her Grief was to have this Spy upon her Actions.</p>
                        <p>When Night approach'd, my Friend came according to Appointment, and during our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I told my Wife, ſhe was to look upon him as my only Friend, and give him the ſame Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, as if it was my ſelf, in every thing he ſhould deſire; well knowing (I told her) he would ask nothing contrary to our ſtrict Amity.</p>
                        <p>Sir, ſaid my Friend, I am very ſorry I can't comply with your Deſires; for I have receiv'd Letters from a near Relation at <hi>Panama,</hi> and I am obliged to attend his Nuptials, being he can't make proper Marriage Settlements with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out I am upon the Spot, and I fear I ſhall hardly return this ſix Weeks. I was at firſt very much ſurpriz'd at this his ſudden Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was going to ſay ſomething upon't, till I obſerv'd he wink'd at me. I then began to remember what he ſaid to me in the Morning, that I ſhould not take Notice of what he ſaid. But I obſerv'd, the Cloud upon my Wife's Face began to diſappear by degrees, which ſeem'd to me the greateſt Proof of her Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. I was ſo provok'd with the imaginary Wrong, that I could not help ſhewing it in Words and Actions; but yet I had ſo much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in my Madneſs (for Paſſion is no leſs) that I conceal'd the real Clauſe.</p>
                        <p>My Wife ſeem'd confounded at my incoherent Anger, having never ſeen my Fury before; and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0388100100:281"/>
when my Friend was gone, begg'd I would tell her the real cauſe of my Uneaſineſs, for ſhe was well aſſur'd ſome ſecret Cauſe had ruffled my Temper; but I perſiſted in the Obſtinacy of not diſcovering it to her, and the next Day purſu'd my Journey with a diſmal Idea of what was to come.</p>
                        <p>Thought had ſo much impair'd my Strength, with its violent Workings, that I found it a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing to ſit my Horſe; and when I came to my Inn at Night, I was carry'd to Bed in a violent Feaver, and all Night was in a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium. My Servants ſent for a Phyſician, who gave me ſomething to reſiſt my Malady; and while he was with me, I utter'd ſome Words in my Ravings, that gave him to underſtand my Diſeaſe proceeded from the Mind. When I came to my ſelf, I was ſomething ſurpriz'd to hear him ſpeak to me after this Manner.</p>
                        <p>Sir, I have ſo long dealt with Diſeaſes of moſt kinds, that I have Knowledge enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive when they proceed from an ill habit of Body, or thoſe Maladies of the Mind that ſlight all Phyſic; and be not amaz'd when I tell you, I have often cur'd the Latter by wholſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. You are a young Man, and perhaps may have taken a wrong Conception of Things; if you will be pleas'd to tell me your Caſe, I'll give you my Advice without a Fee; and don't think me impertinent to deſire it, I have ſeen more Years than you. You may conceal your Name in your Relation, and if my Advice does not pleaſe you, you are but juſt where you were: I ſhall be as faithful in keeping your Secret, as your Confeſſor.</p>
                        <p>You may be aſſur'd I was very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at his Proceeding, and I eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Sincerity in his Diſcourſe, that gain'd him my Eſteem; and I was reſolv'd to let him
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0388100100:282"/>
into my Story; which I did, as much as I have to you.</p>
                        <p>After a Pauſe, he ſaid I had juſt come up to his Imagination of my Caſe; and now Sir, (ſaid he) I will proceed to my Advice. Conſider well what you are about; you have confeſs'd, your Friend own'd to you he made pretended Love to your Wife to try her Virtue, and yet I don't find he advis'd with you about it before he had put his Device in Practice. To give you my Sentiments of this Matter, I believe your Friend to be falſe to you, and that he really is in Love with your Wife. The Diſtreſs of your Spouſe, proceeded from her Indignation to him, and Love to you. His telling you, after his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon her, was no more than to be the firſt in the Declaration, as imagining ſhe would of courſe inform you with it! her keeping it a Secret from you, was, not to make you uneaſy; and his declaring his Suſpicion of her Virtue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, was either to be reveng'd on her for ſlighting his Paſſion, or to give him an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in your Abſence to wrong your Wife.</p>
                        <p>This, in ſhort, I fancy will prove the whole Truth. Neither is this Judgment hard to make, for I am apt to believe any diſintereſted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would make the ſame Judgment; your Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion has blinded yours; yet nevertheleſs, if you can give your ſelf time to think calmly, I don't in the leaſt doubt but you'll be of my Opinion. This I am aſſur'd of, Jealouſy is a certain ſign of Love; and if you ſhould in the heat of Paſſion do a raſh Deed, every Moment of your Life will prove a Torment to you. Lovers Eyes are often falſe, and too quick in falſe Creations. Call Reaſon to your Aſſiſtance; that will prove your beſt Friend. Take ſome time to think of my Advice and Counſel; Friends may aſſoon prove falſe as
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0388100100:283"/>
Wives, and you had better loſe the former than the latter.</p>
                        <p>All the while he was ſpeaking, methought I was liſtening to an Oracle; and at the end of his Diſcourſe, I could not help blaming my ſelf for my raſh Belief. I call'd over in my Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry every Moment of my Wife's Behaviour, and could not find any one Action ſtart up, to give me that hard Opinion I had raſhly conceiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her.</p>
                        <p>I return'd the Phyſician of my Mind, as well as Body, many Thanks for his cordial Advice; and would have paid him in another Coin, but I could not prevail upon him to take a ſingle Dollar. No, ſaid he, in accepting of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I ſhall make it appear, that, like Lawyers, I pleaded for my Fee. No Sir, all the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence I ſhall ask of you, is only to let me know the Truth of every thing, when the Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe is over, which I hope will not affect your Wife; And if I might throw in one Word of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice more, if you prove the Friend you have ſo much confided in to be falſe, ſhew your Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by ſlighting him, and leave Revenge to Heaven. I promis'd to follow his judicious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in every Thing, and ſo we parted with a very good Regard for each other.</p>
                        <p>I was reſolved to proceed no farther on my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but make the beſt of my Way back again; and as I went along, conſider of my Behaviour, and let Time alone for Proof. The Reaſon I gave my Servants for returning, was, that I had not Strength to purſue my Journey; which in Reality was no Falſhood, for I was weak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and I am convinc'd, that Diſorders of the Mind weaken the Body more than habitual Diſtempers. In part of my Journey back, I could not come to any Reſolution how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0388100100:284"/>
and therefore reſolved to lye one more Night upon the Road, to ſee if my Pillow would adviſe me. When I arriv'd at my Inn, one of my Servants told me <hi>Don Roderigo</hi> was juſt alighted. Hearing him nam'd, my Blood ran a wild Courſe about my Body, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately it ſtruck to my Mind ſomething was not right.</p>
                        <p>I ask'd my Servant, if <hi>Roderigo</hi> had ſeen him; he told me no, and that he ſeem'd diſguis'd, as if he did not deſire to be known. This ſtrengthen'd my Suſpicion of ſome Ill intended, or done already, and that he was making his Eſcape. I order'd my Servants not to appear: But when Supper was ready, I ſent for my Hoſt to bear me Company; where, after ſome trivial Diſcourſe, I ask'd him what Gueſts he had in the Houſe. He made no Scruple in telling me; but when he came to <hi>Don Roderigo,</hi> he declar'd he did not much like him; for he ſeem'd very willing to be private with two of his Servants, and he had obſerv'd 'em often whiſpering. They deſign, ſaid he, to be going very early in the Morning, but I don't know which Road they travel. I conceal'd my Diſturbance of Mind from my Hoſt, but reſolv'd to be going as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Don Roderigo;</hi> and to be ſure of being early enough, I determin'd not to go to Bed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Weakneſs of my Body requir'd Repoſe.</p>
                        <p>In the middle of the Night, I heard People whiſpering in the next Room, and I could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſtinguiſh <hi>Roderigo</hi>'s Voice: tho' I could gather little of their Diſcourſe, yet I could hear mine and my Wife's Name often mention'd.</p>
                        <p>At break of Day, I found they were prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be gone; and tho' I was pretty expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, yet they were got out of the Inn, before
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0388100100:285"/>
I could get on Horſe-back with my Servants. I was much vex'd at it, yet purſu'd my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney homeward. But I was very much amaz'd, when about two Leagues from <hi>Lima,</hi> I met my Wife in a Coach with her Maid, and two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Servants. The Servants, aſſoon as they ſaw me, were overjoy'd, and my Wife could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen her Mouth for ſome time. I then began to relapſe into my former Jealouſie, and imagin'd ſhe was following <hi>Don Roderigo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At laſt ſhe open'd her Mouth with a great deal of Joy. Lord, my Dear (ſaid ſhe) is it you in Reality, or are my Senſes deceiv'd? I ask'd her the Reaſon of her Journey, and her mighty Surprize. Sir, anſwer'd ſhe, that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion confounds me; have I not a Letter from you, to come with all Speed imaginable? Here it is, continu'd ſhe. I took the Letter from her, and read the Contents.</p>
                        <floatingText type="letter">

                              <p>PUrſuing my Journey, I had the Misfortune to fall from my Horſe, and break my Arm, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents my writing to you.

                        <p>There needed no Sphynx to unriddle this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigma; and I obſerv'd, by my Wife's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we both knew the Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. While we were confus'd, the Coachman that drove the Coach was ſtealing away; but
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0388100100:286"/>
my Wife cry'd out to ſtop him, for that was the Meſſenger that brought the Letter to her; and farther told her, he was to conduct her to me, for the Coachman we had before was drown'd; and that Circumſtance 'deceiv'd her more than any thing elſe: The Fellow alſo told her that I had prevail'd with a Gentleman in the Neighbourhood where I lay hurt, to ſend him to drive the Coach. I rid after the Fellow and brought him back, order'd him into the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box, and forc'd him to drive out of the Road to a neighbouring Village, where liv'd a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of my Acquaintance. He very unwillingly comply'd with my Commands; and we kept very cloſe to him, to prevent his making away. When we arriv'd at my Friend's Houſe, we ſecur'd the Fellow in a ſtrong Room, and I left two of my <hi>Indian</hi> Servants to guard him. I made my Friend acquainted with the Accident, and that this Viſit was not intended, but by meer Chance. He gave me to know I was welcome, let what would bring me there.</p>
                        <p>When my Wife and I with my Friend were alone, I tenderly embrac'd her, and begg'd her Pardon for my unjuſt Suſpicions of her Virtue, and related the whole Progreſs of my Jealouſie, without omitting the leaſt Circumſtance. She gave thanks to Heav'n, for the Danger ſhe was ſav'd from, and related to me the manner of her being deceiv'd by the Fellow that brought the Letter, as follows.</p>
                        <p>The fifth Day after you had left me, as I was muſing in the Garden, my Maid told me a Perſon had a Letter to deliver me from you. I began to tremble with timorous Apprehenſion, and my whole Frame felt violent Diſorders. I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Bearer to be brought to me; and when I had read the Letter, Grief lock'd up my
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0388100100:287"/>
Tongue, and I had not power to ſpeak for ſome time. When I had recover'd Speech, I ask'd the Fellow where you were. Madam, ſaid he, he is at Don <hi>Florio</hi>'s Country-houſe, <hi>(naming a Friend of mine, that my Wife had heard me often mention)</hi> and knowing you had never a Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, my Maſter ſent me to conduct you to your Husband. I would not ſpend time in dreſſing my ſelf, but juſt as I was, with my Maid, and the two <hi>Indians,</hi> purſu'd our Journey. I never once dream'd of any Treachery, tho' I always doubted your falſe Friend; but as he had never been to viſit me in your Abſence, it wip'd away all Suſpicions of him. I obſerv'd the Coachman, by his Looks, did not like the Company of my Servants, but I was too much concern'd for you to think of it much.</p>
                        <p>We congratulated one another again at our happy Deliverance, and admir'd the workings of Divine Providence, and the ſecond Cauſe, my friendly Phyſician.</p>
                        <p>My Wife expreſs'd a great Deſire to ſee him, to return him Acknowledgments for his inſpir'd Advice, and in the Morning I promis'd her to go to him, if we could get any convenient Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: For we were not very fond of making Uſe of the Coachman that brought her out.</p>
                        <p>I defer'd his Examination till the next Day, being too much fatigu'd to do it then, tho' I order'd he ſhould want nothing but his Liberty; for I conſider'd him only as an Inſtrument to work his Maſter's Ends. When I was up in the Morning, I order'd him to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; but after ſome time, they brought me Word he had made his Eſcape, by creeping through the Cieling of the Room, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Shingles; for it was a ſingle A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment near the Garden. I was a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy

at his getting away, as well as my Wife, for fear his Maſter ſhould make ſome Attempt upon us in the Houſe where we were; it being a quarter of a Mile from the Village, and the Gentleman, my Friend, had but few Servants. Therefore it was thought the ſafeſt Courſe for us to go immediately to <hi>Lima.</hi> And aſſoon as we could procure Mules, we ſet out, and reach'd that City without Moleſtation.</p>
                        <p>I heard nothing of the faithleſs <hi>Roderigo</hi> for ſeveral Days, neither did I think it ſtrange; for I imagin'd, if he had any Shame left, he would not dare to appear publickly at <hi>Lima;</hi> but if he did, I had reſolv'd to take my friendly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian's Advice, (which had prov'd ſo ſucceſsful to me) to ſhow my Reſentment in ſlighting him.</p>
                        <p>One Night, as ſoft Repoſe had lock'd up our Senſes, we were alarm'd from our downy Sleep, by a fearful cry of Fire! Fire! I roſe, and ran into my Wife's Apartment, where ſhe remain'd frighted almoſt to death; and as People generally in the alarm of Fire know not what they do, ſhe ran to the Chamber where the Maids lay, and dreſs'd herſelf in her Servant's Cloaths; the Maid being equally frighted, when ſhe found ſhe had no Cloaths to put on, clap'd on her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs's which I had brought after her, and was running down Stairs to free herſelf from the Danger. As ſhe was going through the Hall, I obſerv'd four Men in Masks ſeiz'd her, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd her off. I follow'd with my Sword in my Hand, till one of the villanous Company came behind me, and run me through the Back. My Servants, who came after me, bore me in faint with loſs of Blood; but by good Fortune the Wound did not prove dangerous, tho' well meant.</p>

                           <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0388100100:289"/>
We could never come by the Truth how the Houſe was ſet on Fire, tho' it was ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd; but we were aſſur'd it muſt be by ſome one of the Domeſtics. It was eaſy to judge Don <hi>Roderigo</hi> was the Cauſe on't, by running away with the Maid, as miſtaking her for my Wife, becauſe ſhe had in the Hurry put on her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs's Cloaths and Vail.</p>
                        <p>I was advis'd, by my beſt Friends, to ſummon him before the ſupream Judge, for it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to let him go on with Impunity. But he would not obey the Summons, therefore he was deſign'd to be out-law'd by due courſe of Law. But as that takes up ſeveral Months, I was oblig'd to keep a Guard in my Houſe; for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral menacing Letters frequently from him, either thrown over the Wall, or left ſo, that we could never ſecure any Perſon that brought 'em. While our Suit was going on, our new Vice-Roy arriv'd, who proving a Friend to Don <hi>Roderigo,</hi> a <hi>nolle proſequi</hi> was iſſued out, and I was obliged to ſtand at the whole Charge of the Law-ſuit. This violent and unjuſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Vice-Roy's rais'd my Gaul to that degree, that I ſaid many warm things againſt his Adminiſtration, which came to his Knowledge: for there are generally poor-ſpirited Wretches in all Governments, that have no other Merit than to improve Tales, and feed the Ears of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors with nauſeous Flattery and Lyes.</p>
                        <p>I was ſent for to the Vice-Roy, and examin'd concerning theſe Reports; and I ſo far incens'd him with my Replies to his Queſtions, that if I had not met with ſome Friends that palliated the Matter, I don't know how far his Reſentment would have carry'd him. I was diſmiſs'd with my Liberty, but a multitude of Menaces, if for the future I ever gave my Tongue another looſe;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0388100100:290"/>
and I ſoon found the Effects of his Reſentment, by loſing a ſmall Place in the Government; but as Providence had put me above wanting it, I was not much griev'd at the Loſs.</p>
                        <p>My Wife begg'd me to remove from <hi>Lima,</hi> a Place where I had receiv'd ſo many Inſults; and it was not improbable but I might receive more; which prov'd but too true.</p>
                        <p>In a few Days after I had appear'd before the Vice-Roy, the Maid that was forc'd away (by miſtaking her for my Wife) came home, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ill us'd, and brought me a Letter from the ungrateful Don <hi>Roderigo,</hi> which you may read if you pleaſe: upon that he took the Letter out of his Pocket, and I found it as follows.</p>

                        <p>The Inſolence of this Letter was not to be born, and I was as impatient to meet him, as he could be to meet with me; and I muſt own to you, I thirſted for his Blood, for his Uſage was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

the nature of Man to bear. I examin'd the poor Girl of what ſhe knew of the Wretch, who inform'd me that they put her into a Coach, and carry'd her a League out of Town; but when they found their Miſtake, the Uſage ſhe bore from 'em was inſupportable, and the Brute <hi>Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigo</hi> told his Servants, if they pleas'd to make uſe of her in the vileſt Manner, they were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The Wretches that ſerv'd ſuch a Villain, muſt have very near the ſame Sentiments of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Honeſty, or they would ſeek another Maſter; they were too forward to neglect ſuch a Cruelty, and four of 'em by turns raviſh'd her. Strangers to the nature of the Wretches, who are Superiors in this Part of the World, would imagine ſuch Deeds ſhould find Puniſhment by Law: But alas! Juſtice is fled the Place, and we may expect more Mercy from the worſt of Cannibals, than is to be found here.</p>
                        <p>The poor Creature in a little Time felt the farther Effects of their Cruelty; for they gave her a Diſtemper that ended her Life.</p>
                        <p>Before her Death ſhe gave me Knowledge of the Place where they led her; for they had not any Caution in their villanous Proceeding, but aſſoon as they had gratify'd their Luſt and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, turn'd her out of Doors.</p>
                        <p>I had no farther need of any thing to whet my Revenge; but I muſt own, the Death of this unfortunate poor Creature added Fuel to the Fire. My Wife was almoſt diſtracted at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Accident, and had no other Conſolation, but that ſhe had eſcap'd their cruel Hands.</p>
                        <p>I did not acquaint her with my Intention of ſeeking this Villain, but I made it my only Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; I went to the Place the poor Maid had directed me, where I had Information that he had left the Place, and now reſided in <hi>Lima.</hi> I was

                        <p>I choſe St. <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Field, for the Conveniency of a ſmall Publick-houſe which over-look'd it, where I went before Day, that I might diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver if he came alone; for I had but little reaſon to expect fair Play from ſuch a Villain. When the time came, I ſaw him go by the Houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; I let him paſs by me, to ſee if he was not follow'd by any of his curſed Crew; but finding none, I haſted after him, into the middle of the Field, and call'd to him; he turn'd about, and with the Image of Hell in his Face, he cry'd, I thought your Reſentment would have brought you firſt into the Field: But as I am here before you, it ſpeaks me no Coward, tho' your vile Scrawl would intimate as much. Come, ſaid I, no Words, thy Breath is Poiſon to me, it will inſect the Air; Only this Sir, ſaid he, as you had not nam'd any particular Weapon, I have made bold to bring a pair of Piſtols with me, and to let you ſee I have ſome Honour, you ſhall take your Choice. I gave him no Anſwer, but took one, and we agreed to ſtand at ſuch a Diſtance. As I was going to Fire, he cry'd out
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0388100100:293"/>
Hold! I will tell you one Secret more before we engage, and that's this; Your Piſtol is only charg'd with Powder, but mine with Ball, which I put in ſince you made the Choice; and now prepare for Death, be aſſur'd this is the laſt Moment of thy Life. I did not give my ſelf time to anſwer, but fir'd my Piſtol, and then hurl'd it at him, and had the good Fortune to cut him in the Face with it; and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Surprize his Piſtol went off without hurting me. Now, ſaid I, thou Wretch! we are once more on equal Terms, and Heav'n I hope will favour the juſteſt Cauſe. We drew, and in a few Paſſes I laid him for dead on the Ground; tho' in the Encounter I had receiv'd a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wound in the Breaſt. I went home, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my Hurt, and ſent ſecretly for a Surgeon of my Acquaintance, who dreſs'd me, and told me I was in no Danger.</p>
                        <p>My Wife was very much griev'd at the Accident, tho' ſhe could not but be pleas'd at <hi>Roderigo</hi>'s Death; yet her Fears increas'd, as imagining I ſhould ſuffer for it, by the violent Temper of the Vice-roy: But her Grief began to blow over, when in ſeveral Days after, no Enquiry was made, nor even any Notice taken of his Death.</p>
                        <p>I was very much ſurpriz'd at it, imagining I had really kill'd him.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as my Wound was well, I went to the little Houſe to enquire if they knew any thing of the Body; (for the Owner of the Houſe was formerly my Servant, and a Man of much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, who knew all my Story;) he inform'd me, that a little while after I paſt by his Houſe home again, five Perſons ran that way, and coming to the Body, ſeem'd to mourn over it, and went the Road that leads to St. <hi>Dominick; a Village a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half a Mile from the Place where we fought.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0388100100:294"/>
I imagin'd they had bury'd him privately in that Village, and went home to acquaint my Wife, who ſhar'd my Contentment.</p>
                        <p>I now went abroad as I was wont, and all the Diſcourſe was of Don <hi>Roderigo</hi>'s ſudden diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. Servants and all had left his Houſe, but no one ſuſpected any thing of his Death. Some of my Acquaintance told me, they imagin'd this to be ſome Trick of his, and that he only lay dormant to meditate ſome Miſchief to me.</p>
                        <p>I ſeem'd to come into their Fears, but in my Mind ſlighted their Advice, as imagining I had nothing to fear. I paſt on a whole Month without any Danger at all; but as I was going one Day acroſs the Bridge to a Warehouſe I had in the Suburbs, a Fellow came up to me, and privately ask'd me if I would be his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for ſome <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods. He told me a long Story, that he was oblig'd to make up a Cargo and leave this Part of the World, for his Credit began to fail, and if he did not get away ſpeedily, his Creditors would lay him up. We went to a neighbouring Tavern, where he read me his Bill of Parcels. He told me he had been encourag'd to offer his Goods to me, from the fairneſs of my Character; and was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to wait on me when he had the good Fortune to meet me. The next Day was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on for me to go and view the Goods, for I was not to pay for 'em till they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd my Warehouſe. Accordingly, as appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I went to the Houſe of the Perſon, in the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Street. I was ſhown into a Room till the Goods were brought; but as I was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome Paintings, five Men ruſh'd out of a Cloſet in the Room, and ſeiz'd me. They diſarm'd me, took out every thing that was in my Pockets, went out, and lock'd me in.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0388100100:295"/>
You may imagine the Surprize I was in, which was very much increas'd when I ſaw my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>Don Roderigo</hi> enter the Room. I in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion thought I had ſeen a Ghoſt, for he look'd very pale; but he ſoon convinc'd me of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And have I got you at laſt? ſaid he: I now will revenge my ſelf at leiſure; but to compleat my Revenge, I have ſent a Token for your Wife, that I may raviſh her before thy Face; and then I'll deviſe Tortures to rack e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Joint about thee. He gave me to know that he had ſent my Watch for a Token, and that ſhe would bring ſuch a Sum of Money to pay for the Goods. The Torment of my Soul no Tongue can expreſs; and I am aſſur'd, if they had not taken my Sword from me, I had put an End to my wretched Life.</p>
                        <p>The inhumane Villain inſulted me ſo much, that I ruſh'd upon him, unarm'd as I was, and had certainly choak'd him, if his wicked Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants had not dragg'd me from him.</p>
                        <p>It is well, ſaid he, I have no other Paſſion but Luſt reigning in my Breaſt at this Inſtant; but when I have ſated my Deſires on thy Wife, I'll then add another Pang for this Uſage; but in the mean time I'll leave you to think of this Matter alone, for I fancy you don't much care for my Company.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as he had made an End of this Speech, he and his Gang went out, and faſten'd the Door on the other ſide. I'll give you Leave to imagine the Confuſion of my Thoughts. I remain'd ſome time without moving; but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally caſting my Eyes on the Door, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd there was a Bar to ſhut it on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. I immediately barr'd it, and began to look about to ſee if I could find any thing for my Defence; but to my Grief could perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0388100100:296"/>
I enter'd the Cloſet, and ſearch'd there, but to no purpoſe. Looking upon the Floor of the Cloſet, I perceiv'd one of the Boards ſeem'd to be looſe: I eſſay'd to pull it up, but wanted ſome Engine to effect it. I at laſt thought of the Bar of the Door, ran to it, and by main Force wrench'd it from the Staple; for I thought if it would not ſerve me to make my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, it would ſerve me to defend my ſelf: but I eaſily forc'd up the Board, and with my Bar beat down the Ceiling under me. I was reſolv'd to explore the hidden Place, whatever was the Conſequence; for it could not be worſe than to remain where I was. I therefore ventur'd down, though ſomething of a difficult Deſcent; for the Joyces were ſo cloſe together, I had much ado to force my Body through; but at laſt, with much Difficulty, I preſs'd through, and had a deſperate Fall to the Ground.</p>
                        <p>I ſoon found I had got into a Cooper's Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, for there were ſeveral Pipe-ſtaves, and Tools to work with. I ſeiz'd upon ſome of them, and by Force wrench'd open the Cellar-Door, which led me once more into the Street before <hi>Don Roderigo</hi>'s Houſe. I did not give my ſelf Time to conſider, but ran towards the Bridge to get to my own Houſe; and juſt as I enter'd the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> Street, I met my Wife with her Maid, and the Wretch that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy'd me to the Houſe. I ran upon him, ſeiz'd him by the Throat, and flung him over the Bridge, where he met with the Reward of his Villany. I had not Power of Speech to inform my Wife of the Accident, but made Signs for her to go home. By this time it was dark; and the profligate Villain <hi>Don Roderigo,</hi> fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his curſed Emiſſary ſtaid too long, came out of his Door which fac'd the Bridge. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0388100100:297"/>
as I diſcover'd him, I ran towards him, and ſeiz'd him: Now Villain, ſaid I, I will not part with thee till thou haſt render'd up thy Soul to Hell. We both ſtruggled, and I kept him down; but the reſt of his Company coming up to his Aſſiſtance, I quitted him; and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſee if I could meet with ſome one arm'd, I had the good Fortune to light on you. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as I receiv'd your Sword, I ran back, and juſt met the Villain as he was entring his Door. I ran the Weapon into his very Heart; and I believe you were a better Witneſs of his Death than my ſelf, being you were found near the Body.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as I ſaw him fall I made the beſt of my way home, not imagining you would meet with any farther Damage than the Loſs of your Sword.</p>
                        <p>The Darkneſs of the Night, I fancy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd me from the Servants that came to the Aſſiſtance of their Maſter, for I never once was ſuſpected; or perhaps if they did know me, Fear kept 'em from diſcovering me.</p>
                        <p>When I heard of your Tryal, I came my ſelf into Court, and if you had been condemn'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to have diſcover'd the Truth; but finding you were to be baniſhed to <hi>Baldivia,</hi> I conceal'd the Fact, imagining I had it in my Power to gain your Freedom, by paying your Ranſom; which was the Reaſon I came now to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, to offer you my Service in that, or any thing elſe that lies in my Power. I return'd him Thanks for his Offer; and conſidering his Story, I told him I was glad I was in ſome ſort an Inſtrument of his Revenge. He would force upon me a Ring, and two hundred Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gold, and begg'd he might be rank'd in the Number of my Friends. He made me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0388100100:298"/>
Viſits, and once brought his Wife with him. She was a very handſome Woman, and ſeem'd to have a great deal of Wit. She made me ſeveral very handſome Compliments in behalf of her Husband, and begg'd I would accept of their Pictures ſet round with fine oriental Pearls.</p>
                        <p>He accompany'd me on Board when our Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was to ſet Sail, putting in the Captain's Hands freſh Proviſion, and ſeveral ſorts of good Liquor to comfort me in my Voyage.</p>
                        <p>I had the Happineſs to have Pirates for my Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Suflerers; and the Viceroy had given out, to take off all Cenſure from him, that I encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd 'em in their Piracy.</p>
                        <p>We took our Leaves, with Proteſtations of a laſting Friendſhip; and I liv'd as merrily as I could, till the Day we had the good Fortune to meet with you, which has not given me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reaſon to change my Humour.</p>

            <p>WE were mightily diverted with the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and I found I was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd when I took him for a Man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the World.</p>
            <p>We had now gain'd the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and had enter'd the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea: But I muſt confeſs I could not ſee the <hi>African</hi> Shore, without Numbers of Sighs for Misfortunes paſt; and I found my Griefs renew'd with the Remembrance: And all the Mitigation I had was the affectionate Concern from <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> to whom I had told my whole Story. We had not made a Day's Sail in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> ere we perceiv'd two Sail making towards us. I muſt own I had no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to engage, being ſo richly laden; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by the Advice of both the Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, made all the Sail I could to avoid 'em. But our Veſſels being foul with ſo long a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and never once clean'd during our whole
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0388100100:299"/>
Courſe, they gain'd upon us, do what we could. When we found there was no getting from 'em without Fighting, we were as much deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd on the other Hand to fight our Ships to the Bottom of the Sea rather than ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Having fix'd this Reſolution, we prepar'd for the Engagement; and when we had got all Things in Readineſs, we leſſen'd our Sails that they might come up to us. I order'd every Sailor to load as many ſmall Arms as they could, and not to fire a Gun till I gave 'em Orders; but aſſoon as ever they had fir'd the great Guns, to diſcharge their ſmall Arms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em. I could not prevail upon <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> to keep below, though I ſaw Fear livelily painted in his Face. When they came within Piſtol-ſhot of our Ship they hail'd us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to ſtrike immediately. We made no other Anſwer than with our Guns and ſmall Arms, which ſurpriz'd 'em, and did 'em a great deel of Damage in their Rigging; for cutting the Topſail Halliards with our Shot, the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail fell down upon the Cap, and hinder'd their Ship's Way very much; and I believe we might have made our Eſcape. But I perceiv'd the <hi>Villars</hi> was hard put to it, (our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man of War, whom I had nam'd the <hi>Villars</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that dear One.) By this time we were prepar'd again, and I order'd every Man, aſſoon as they had diſcharg'd, to lye flat upon their Bellies till we had receiv'd the Fire of the Enemy; which accordingly we did. They fir'd in upon us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but kill'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>oſe up all together, and fir'd in our ſmall Shot. We had ſo damag'd their Rigging with this Broadſide, that we fell aſtern till we were charg'd again; and then I gave our Men Orders to fire into the Body of the Ship, and point their Guns low on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0388100100:300"/>
which we ſoon found had the deſir'd Effect: For they had ſeveral Shots between Wind and Water, ſo that they were oblig'd to heel the Ship on the Starboard Side, to prevent the Water running in on the Larboard. I ſeeing there was not much to be fear'd from her, bore down to aſſiſt the <hi>Villars,</hi> becauſe ſhe was over-match'd. But when her Antagoniſt found my Deſign, and underſtood the Condition of the other Ship, ſhe made all the Sail ſhe could, and fled for it. We did not think fit to follow her, but ſent a Boat on Board, to enquire how it ſtood with 'em in the <hi>Villars.</hi> They ſent me Word they had loſt eight Men, had three wounded, and were very much mawl'd in their Rigging, as well as their Hull, and had receiv'd a Shot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Wind and Water, and the Ship leak'd very much. I bad 'em ſearch for it; but there was no coming at it; therefore I order'd them to get out as many of the Goods as they could, and bring them on Board me. The Weather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very favourable, they went to Work as faſt as they could.</p>
            <p>Our Men brought me Word that the Ship we had engag'd was ſinking. They fir'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Guns for Aſſiſtance, and their Conſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt out of Sight, I bore down to help them all I could; but before we could come to 'em ſhe ſunk to the Bottom. The Men had put out their Long-boat and Barge, and were got in them, and made towards us. Aſſoon as they came within hearing, they call'd out for <hi>Quarter,</hi> which I promis'd 'em they ſh uld have. There were 123 of 'em; and as their Number exceeded ours, we were oblig'd to confine 'em, for fear they ſhould take it in their Heads to ſet upon us.</p>
            <p>The Captain was kill'd in the Engagement, but the Lieutenant inform'd me they were two
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0388100100:301"/>
Men of War, of forty Guns each, ſet out from <hi>Barcelona</hi> to cruiſe upon the Coaſt; and mann'd each with two hundred Men: But the reſt of their Crew were either kill'd, or being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſunk with the Ship. I did not think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to carry 'em to <hi>Italy,</hi> for fear it ſhould prove prejudicial to <hi>Don Antonio;</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that in removing the Goods on Board the <hi>Villars,</hi> they had found out the Leak and ſtopp'd it, I intended to put 'em on board her, and give 'em the Ship with their Liberty; but firſt I order'd out the Guns and Ammunition, and her Goods, leaving 'em nothing but Proviſion and Water, which they return'd me many Thanks for, and ſo we parted.</p>
            <p>The next Day there aroſe ſuch a Storm as we had never felt before, and continu'd in the utmoſt Violence for fourteen Days, ſo that now we were in Danger of drowning; and I believe moſt would have parted with their Wealth to have been ſafe on Shore. At laſt we diſcover'd Land, but were very much ſurpriz'd to find it <hi>Candia,</hi> for now we began to be in fear of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirates. So we reſolv'd to ſteer for <hi>Zant</hi> as faſt as we could, and there make Dividend of our Prize-Money and Goods. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we arriv'd there ſafely, <hi>Sept.</hi> 3. 1696.</p>
            <p>This Iſland of <hi>Zant</hi> belongs to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> therefore we were out of Danger from the <hi>Turks.</hi> The Town, which bears the ſame Name with the Iſland, is above a Mile in Length, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Beach of the Bay. It is built moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Stone, and has a noble Look from the Sea. To the Weſt of the Town ſtands the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, built on a high and very ſteep Hill, where moſt of the Merchants dwell, and is very near as big as the City below. It is a Biſhop's See, and the Governour is of the Nobility of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0388100100:302"/>
The chief Commodities they deal in are Wine, Oyl, and Currants, which are eſteem'd of the beſt Growth. They grow on Vines like other Grapes, and are gather'd in <hi>July,</hi> and then pack'd in Hogſheads ready for the Merchants.</p>
            <p>Our Men being well pleas'd they were out of Danger, and in a Place where Wine was to be bought cheap, traffick'd ſo much for that Commodity, that moſt of them fell into dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſeaſes; therefore I reſolv'd to leave <hi>Zant,</hi> and make for <hi>Sapienza,</hi> an Iſland with a good Harbour, not inhabited, where they would not be under the like Temptation; ſo we came to an Anchor there, <hi>Sept.</hi> 8. I order'd twelve Guns on Shore, and rais'd a Platform capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending us from the inſults of an Enemy. In a pleaſant Green we put up a large Tent, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſmaller by it for the Officers and Sailors: But I having but one Bed put up on Shore, <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> was forc'd to lie with me, tho' as I thought very unwillingly. Our ſharing the ready Money took us up four Days. I reſerv'd a fourth Part to my Owners, which amounted to upwards of ſixty thouſand Pound; and a twelfth Part for my ſelf, which, with what Preſents and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things that I had, amounted to the value of fifty thouſand Pound. Every Sailor from firſt to laſt ſhar'd above twelve hundred Pound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; but when we came to divide the Goods, we knew not which way to go about it; ſo with one common Conſent of the Sailors, I was oblig'd to accept of them, without paying one Penny for them.</p>
            <p>We ſet Sail for <hi>Oſtia</hi> the next Day, after we had finiſh'd our Dividend, and arriv'd there <hi>Nov.</hi> 1. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Voyage of two Years and ſeven Months, and the richeſt Prize that ever came into any Port of <hi>Italy.</hi> I ſent a Letter to <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> to give him
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0388100100:303"/>
Notice of my Arrival, and Advice to come and take Care of his Cargo. In two Days, he, <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Iſabella,</hi> and their little Son came on Board in a Pleaſure-Boat. I found they were in Mourning, and I told 'em I was afraid to ask 'em who it was for; they inform'd me that <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s Father had been dead above two Years, but they had reſolv'd never to wear any other Colour, till they had ſeen me. Never was a more tender Meeting between Friends, than between us; and I muſt confeſs, for ſome time all my Cares lay huſh'd.</p>
            <p>When I came to inform <hi>Don Antonio</hi> of the Wealth I had brought him home, he ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd: For beſides the Money which I told him of, the Goods I had on Board exceeded in value the Freight I went out with. I could hardly prevail upon him to accept of ſuch a Sum of Money, till I inform'd him it was but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Due, and that I had very near as much to my own Share.</p>
            <p>I preſented <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> to <hi>Antonio</hi> and his Lady, who ſeem'd very much pleas'd with him; and <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> out of his free merry Humour, told me he hop'd I would not forget him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was older, for he thought he had more Right to my Friendſhip than <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> being he was an older Acquaintance. I let 'em into ſome of his Life and Humour: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him yery friendly; and we all went to <hi>Don Antonio</hi>'s <hi>Villa</hi> together.</p>
            <p>After ſtaying a Week, I began to be tir'd with ſo much Pleaſure, and therefore begg'd Leave of <hi>Don Antonio</hi> to viſit <hi>Rome,</hi> only to ſhew <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> that celebrated Place. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> ſent before to his Palace to prepare for our Reception, and the next Day we follow'd. We viſited all the Rarities, ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0388100100:304"/>
where we might ſee the Grandeur of the antient <hi>Romans</hi> by thoſe ſtupendous Ruins ſtill left. As <hi>Rome</hi> was formerly a Nurſery of War and Greatneſs, it is now a Nurſery of Arts, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Painting, Architecture, and Muſick. There have flouriſh'd in one Century, <hi>Lanfranio, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichino, Pietro du Cortona,</hi> the <hi>Poſſine's, Camaſſei, Guercin da Cento, Chivoli, Andrea Sacchi,</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Raphael, Hannibal Carac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Then <hi>Palladio, Vitruvius, Scamoz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi, Pozza,</hi> and many more, famous for Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture. Then the divine <hi>Corelli</hi> for Muſick, whoſe ſweet Compoſitions will be always new; and we may ſay by him as a great <hi>Engliſh</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſaid of our Countryman <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> that the former had pull'd up the Roots of Muſick, as the latter of Poetry, and tranſplanted 'em into their own Gardens, where all thoſe that follow muſt borrow a Branch from them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſay any thing more of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor of <hi>Naples,</hi> where we went once more, upon <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Account. I would have perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to have begun his Studies at <hi>Rome,</hi> (for I ſuppos'd him a <hi>Roman Catholick)</hi> but he would not hear of it, and begg'd he might go with me into <hi>England,</hi> which I promis'd him he ſhould.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Donna Iſabella</hi> had an Orphan Couſin, that liv'd with her, of a vaſt Fortune, beautiful to a Miracle; who having ſeen Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> fell deſperately in Love with him. But he did not ſeem to have the leaſt Regard for her. <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> diſcover'd to me the Secret, and pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Experience his Kinſwoman, deſir'd I would foward the Match. But when <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> underſtood my Deſires, he fell upon his Knees, and begg'd I would never mention it
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0388100100:305"/>
more; for he had made a ſolemn Reſolution never to marry any Woman breathing. I preſs'd him all I could, and laid the Folly of ſuch a raſh Reſolve before him; but it was preaching to a Tempeſt; and all my Arguments had no Power upon him. On the other hand, the merry <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was as deep in Love with <hi>Donna Felicia,</hi> which was the Name of the Orphan Lady. But his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Courtſhip was ſo odd, and out of the way, that he caus'd more Diverſion than we could have imagin'd. If ſhe went to Bed, he would lay himſelf down at her Chamber Door, and ſing Songs all Night; that if ſhe had any Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have reſted, he was reſolv'd ſhe ſhould not; and he would often ſay, he intended to plague her into a Complyance. If ſhe went into the Garden, he was ſure to follow her cloſe; or even at Church, he would often tell her, it was in vain to pray for a Bleſſing from Heaven, when ſhe was committing Murder with every Look. In ſhort, he would often force a Smile from the afflicted Lady her ſelf.</p>
            <p>I was ſtill endeavouring with <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> to forget his raſh Vow: But he deſir'd me, in ſuch moving T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ms, not to intreat him further, that I reſolv'd never to trouble him any more on that Theme. Notwithſtanding which, I begg'd of <hi>Donna Iſabella</hi> to try what ſhe could do with him, for I imagin'd Complaiſance might work more upon him than Friendſhip. She ſent for him into her Cloſet, and they remain'd together ſeveral Hours; and I was very much pleas'd the next Day to ſee him walking in the Garden, only with <hi>Donna Felicia.</hi> I did not think it proper to interrupt them; but when I had an Opportunity, I declar'd my Satisfaction, and told him I eaſily forgave his not complying with me, and yielding to the Perſwaſion of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0388100100:306"/>
               <hi>Donna Iſabella.</hi> He ſeem'd in ſome Confuſion at what I ſaid to him, which I attributed to his denying me, and his Condeſcenſion to <hi>Donna Iſabella.</hi> But in a few Days after that, I was ſomething more ſurpriz'd to ſee <hi>Don Pedro</hi> eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addreſſing <hi>Donna Felicia,</hi> and ſhe regarding him more favourably than uſual. And my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was encreas'd, when <hi>Donna Iſabella</hi> told me the nuptial Day was fix'd between <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and <hi>Donna Felicia.</hi> I told her I was very well pleas'd, the Lady had ſo ſoon forgot her violent Paſſion; but I added, that the ſtronger the Flame, the ſhorter the Duration. If ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd <hi>Donna Iſabella,</hi> we may hope your Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is bury'd long ſince. I told her, I did not Love like others, for I was reſolv'd to carry mine with me to the Grave. By what I have formerly heard (return'd <hi>Donna Iſabella)</hi> from you, as well as my Husband, you have not the leaſt glimpſe of Hopes. Madam, ſaid I, that is the Reaſon I muſt deſpair; for no other Fire ſhall ever warm my Breaſt, but what was kindled there by my firſt Flame. We had much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the ſame Subject, and <hi>Donna Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> told me at laſt, I was a Pattern for all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lovers.</p>
            <p>When we were at <hi>Naples,</hi> I had provided Goods and Conveniency of ſending to St. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vador,</hi> according to my Promiſe given to <hi>Don Jaques;</hi> and the Veſſel being to touch at <hi>Oſtia,</hi> was to ſend to me for my Letters to <hi>Don Jaques.</hi> I deſir'd <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> to write to his Father; but he begg'd to be excus'd, for fear it ſhould fall into the Hands of his Lady; and for the ſame Reaſon he begg'd I would be cautious how I mention'd him. I told him he ſhould ſee what I had wrote before I ſent it; which was as follows.</p>

            <p>I wrote this Letter in the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Language, and ſhew'd it to <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> who approv'd of what I had written.</p>
            <p>I had diſpos'd of the reſt of my Goods on Board, and the Money amounted to upwards of fifteen thouſand Pound; but I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0388100100:308"/>
upon <hi>Don Antonio</hi> to accept of one Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>No, my dear Friend, ſaid he, you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy brought me the Fortune of a Nobleman; tho' it is not worldly Wealth I covet. I have all the Earth contains in the Poſſeſſion of my adorable Wife: and even that, my greateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, is owing to you; and all the Allay of Joy I have, is, that I cannot ſee you as bleſt as I am. But, continu'd he, Time that wears out all things, will, I hope, cure this amorous Sickneſs of your Soul. I let him know my Grief was as fix'd as Deſtiny, and I had nothing elſe to do but to wing to the Place where the Joy of my Life did once reſide; with this only Hope, that the lively Imagination of my Loſs would put an end to all my Sorrows, by ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me into the Arms of Death.</p>
            <p>He was ſo very much concern'd for me that he could not avoid ſhedding Tears; and us'd all the Arguments he could to perſuade me to reſide in <hi>Italy.</hi> I told him I had more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to go for my native Country than what I had given him, and that was the Education of young <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> who begg'd to cultivate his Studies in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I turn'd all my Money into Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, well knowing the Caſualties that attend Travellers; and I intended to go by Land to <hi>Flanders,</hi> with <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> my two faithful <hi>Indians,</hi> and one Servant more.</p>
            <p>All my <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sailors that I had pick'd up by the Way, had by my Conſent their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and were gone to their ſeveral Homes, in Circumſtances beyond their Expectations; though they all declar'd, if I intended another Voyage, they would never forſake me. Some
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0388100100:309"/>
of my <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sailors had married <hi>Italian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſo deſign'd to ſettle in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I deſir'd <hi>Don Antonio</hi> to take Charge of the Ship, he told me he had nothing to do with it, declaring it was mine, and therefore deſir'd I would make no more Words about it; for, ſaid he, you don't know but you may meet with ſomething to change your Mind, and we may have the Satisfaction of ſeeing you once more.</p>
            <p>In a few Days after this, the Nuptials were celebrated between <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and <hi>Donna Felicia,</hi> who deſign'd for <hi>Spain</hi> (aſſoon as I left <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)</hi> where he intended to take up the Mortgage of his Eſtate, the Time being almoſt expir'd. I muſt own, the Uncertainty of Women's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers gave me much Cogitation; and I thought this Marriage was a very odd Thing.</p>
            <p>I now began to think of my Journey; but firſt I order'd a Goldſmith to make me every way the ſame Parcel of Plate as I received as a Preſent from <hi>Don Jaques de Ramires,</hi> which I preſented to <hi>Donna Iſabella,</hi> that ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me. She gave me many Thanks for it, but ſeem'd very unwilling to accept of it a great while. I told her, as merrily as I could, if ſhe made any more Words about it, I would return her the Ship that bore her Name, and would be no longer under her Command. Well, ſaid ſhe, I'll accept 'em; but as you allow me to be your Owner, I'll give you Orders in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that you muſt not break open till you come in ſuch a Latitude, that is, a Fortnight after you are ſettled in <hi>England.</hi> I promis'd to obey her punctually. The next Day ſhe gave me a ſeal'd Paper, which ſhe told me were the Orders ſhe mention'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0388100100:310"/>
I had given my Lieutenant Charge of the Ship, with Directions to make for <hi>Briſtol</hi> with all the Expedition practicable.</p>
            <p>The next Day, being <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. 1696, I took my Leave of all my Acquaintance; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I am not us'd to weep, could not forbear ſhedding ſome Tears at parting with ſuch true Friends as <hi>Don Antonio</hi> and his Lady had prov'd. I rode the firſt Day overwhelm'd with Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and not one Thought of being poſſeſs'd of ſuch a Fortune, from nothing, in ſo ſhort a Time, ever enter'd my Breaſt. But ſeeing <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> by his Countenance partake of my Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I was forc'd to appear leſs melancholy, to oblige him to be ſo too.</p>
            <p>I would have ſhewn him the Rarities of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in our Travels, but he ſeem'd very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Curioſity: And we arriv'd at <hi>Antwerp</hi> without any Adventure. We ſtaid ſome time there to recover the Fatigue of our Journey, but more upon <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Account, being he was ſomething indiſpos'd, having never tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd on Horſe-back ſo far before.</p>
            <p>As we approach'd the Town, he and my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> were ſurpriz'd to ſee the Manner of Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. The Boys and Girls would run before you, and of a ſudden ſtop ſhort, ſtand upon their Heads, and clap their Hands, ſaying their Prayers all the while.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Antwerp</hi> is finely ſeated upon the River <hi>Scheld;</hi> it is very well fortify'd, and upon the Walls are planted Trees that give an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Shade, and make it pleaſant Walking. The Caſtle, both ſtrong and beautiful, was founded by the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> The City in Bigneſs may compare with <hi>Briſtol;</hi> their Streets ſpacious, and Houſes very magnificent. The Church of <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> their Cathedral, is a ſuperb Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

and of that Neatneſs, that the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, of <hi>Germany,</hi> would often ſay <hi>it was only fit to be kept in a Caſe.</hi> The Inſide is as glorious and neat as the Out. The Paintings were perform'd by Sir <hi>Peter Paul Rubens,</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and are equal to any thing that ever he did. The Jeſuits Church is alſo very beautiful, adorn'd with abundance of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Marble Pillars, and all the Pannels painted by the ſame Hand as the other. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral more beautiful Churches and Chappels; but as theſe mention'd are the chief, we ſhall take no farther Notice of 'em.</p>
            <p>The third of <hi>April,</hi> (having pretty well reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd our Fatigue by a Reſt of ten Days) we ſet out for <hi>Calais,</hi> being the ſhorteſt Cut to <hi>Dover,</hi> and arriv'd there <hi>April</hi> 6; making ſhort Stages.</p>
            <p>From this Place we might behold the white Cliffs of <hi>Dover.</hi> I muſt own I had ſome ſecret Satisfaction in viewing my native Country: and the next Day, early in the Morning, we embark'd, and reach'd the Town by Noon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a very favourable Paſſage. Here landing, I had like to have loſt one of my <hi>Indians.</hi> Slinging his Horſes into the Boat, he would get upon the Back of one of them, thinking he would go out quietly. But juſt upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, a Veſſel riding by the <hi>Peer</hi> fired a Gun, and frighted the Horſe to ſuch a degree, that he plung'd into the Sea, and ſwam from the Shore; and the <hi>Indian</hi> being thrown off with the Start, had his Foot ſo entangled in the Stirrup, that (notwithſtanding his Skill in Swimming) he muſt have inevitably periſh'd, if the other <hi>Indian,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Misfortune, had not plung'd in, and with a Knife cut the String. He then took the Horſe by the Bridle with one Hand, and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0388100100:312"/>
with the other, brought him ſafe to Shore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> not being over-pleas'd with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Horſe-back, we took the Flying-Coach the next Day, and ſafely arriv'd at <hi>London.</hi> I order'd my <hi>Engliſh</hi> Servant and the two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> with our Baggage, to make two Days of it; and gave 'em Directions to wait at the Place where the Coach inn'd, till I ſent for 'em.</p>
            <p>When we arriv'd at <hi>London,</hi> I did not care to go to any of my Acquaintance, but rather choſe to lie at a <hi>Bagnio</hi> for a Day or two; but I ſent privately for my Uncle's Clerk, that had endeavour'd to prevent my being kidnapp'd by putting a Letter in my Pocket, mention'd in the Beginning of this Relation. He came to me according to my Deſire, but was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd and ſurpriz'd to ſee me, though he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew me at firſt, for I had not ſent him my Name.</p>
            <p>He inform'd me that my Uncle had been dead above a Year, and had left his Eſtate to his eldeſt Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Buſineſs to his youngeſt and him: But they would often talk of me, not believing I was in the Land of the Living; yet they had increas'd my ſmall Eſtate with their utmoſt Care, intending, if ever I came back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to reſtore it to me. I let him into my whole Hiſtory, and he was very much pleas'd to hear that I had gain'd ſuch a plentiful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. I got him to provide us convenient Lodgings, and private, for I did not intend to go abroad much; and alſo to go to the Inn to fetch my Servants.</p>
            <p>My two <hi>Indians</hi> ſpoke <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well, and I had learnt 'em to write and read; and being in modern Habits, they were not much gaz'd at.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0388100100:313"/>
The Time being expir'd that I was to look into my Commiſſion, (as <hi>Donna Iſabella</hi> call'd it) I reſolv'd to break it open, having ſome Curioſity. But it was gone, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all my Search, I could not gain any Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of it. I could not imagine how I ſhould loſe that, and nothing elſe. I muſt own I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uneaſie, fearing it might be ſomething of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance I was to do for <hi>Donna Iſabella;</hi> therefore I diſpatch'd a Letter to <hi>Italy,</hi> to tell 'em of my ſafe Arrival, and my Loſs of the Packet, (and to ſend me a freſh one) with Directions where to write to me.</p>
            <p>While I ſtaid in Town, I purchas'd an Eſtate of 2000<hi>l.</hi> a Year in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and yet had 25000<hi>l.</hi> left, which I employ'd in the publick Funds. And now I had ſettled my Eſtate, as well as that I had for <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> I was willing to forward him in his Studies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ſend him to <hi>Oxford</hi> with a Tutor. But he ſtill begg'd to ſtay a little longer with me.</p>
            <p>I therefore took a Reſolution of going to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> only with <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> and one Servant, with no other Buſineſs than to ſee the Place where my loſt Treaſure once liv'd.</p>
            <p>When we were arriv'd, I enquir'd which was the Houſe that Mr. <hi>Villars,</hi> late Merchant, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dwelt in. We ſoon found it out, but were inform'd one Capt. <hi>Kendrick</hi> dwelt there. I was inquiſitive to know if there was any Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of one <hi>Suſan,</hi> who was formerly Maid to Mrs. <hi>Villars,</hi> Daughter to the deceas'd Merchant; and at laſt got Information that ſhe liv'd at a Country Houſe near the Sea-ſide.</p>
            <p>I went immediately away for the Place, tho' near thirty Mile off, and late in the Evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Before we had rid far, the Skies became gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0388100100:314"/>
and a violent Storm threaten'd us, which ſoon overtook us with ſuch Fury, that we were forc'd to put into a little Houſe out of the Road for Shelter. When we came within, we could not ſee any Body in't but a little Child, playing with ſome Toys it had before it; and all we could get out of it was, that <hi>Mamma</hi> would come by and by. It was as lovely a Child as ever I ſaw, and we were ſtill admiring it, when a Man and Woman came in. They were much amaz'd to find us there; but I begg'd their Pardon, and told 'em the Storm drove us in to take Shelter.</p>
            <p>The Man told us we were very welcome to ſuch as his Houſe afforded, but he fear'd we ſhould find but poor Accommodation. In ſhort, the Storm kept up in its full Force, and now it grew dark, and we were two Mile from any Inn; and to add to our Diſtreſs, we were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Road. The Man ſeeing us ſo put to it, told us he had but two Beds, but we ſhould be welcome to 'em, ſuch as they were.</p>
            <p>I told him I would gratifie him for his Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and thereupon gave him a Guinea. He was very well pleas'd with my Preſent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhew it in his Looks, as well as the Woman. I gave him another, to provide us ſomething to eat, and to take care of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. He ſaid he had but bad Stable-room, but if I pleas'd he would take my Servant, and all the Horſes, (with one of his own to bring him back again) and leave 'em at an Inn in the neighbouring Village. I agreed to it; and while he was gone I ask'd the good Woman many Queſtions about the Child which we ſaw there, and ſoon ſound it was none of their own, but a Gentlewoman's, a Stranger to them, and one they had never ſeen but once. Why, ſaid I,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0388100100:315"/>
how are you paid for the keeping of it? She ſeem'd amaz'd at my Queſtion, and was ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe anſwer'd me; but at laſt ſhe ſaid ſhe was always very well paid.</p>
            <p>I finding ſhe did not much care for talking upon that Subject, chang'd the Diſcourſe. Soon after the Man came in, and we went to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I would have had <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> to have lain with me; but the Man underſtanding we uſually lay aſunder, would give us both the Beds, and they would ſit up. I ask'd them where the Child lay; and they told us in a Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. I began to be concerned for the Infant, though without giving any Reaſon. When we had ſupp'd, we went to Bed, and had but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reſt; and when we roſe in the Morning, (it proving fair and pleaſant) we reſolved to walk to the Inn where our Horſes were, with our Hoſt for our Guide. When we arriv'd, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd him with another Guinea; and would have got immediately on Horſe-back, but <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> was ſo very much diſorder'd that he was not able to mount. I was very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for his Indiſpoſition, and begg'd he would repoſe himſelf there, while I purſu'd my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; with a Promiſe to return the next Day, or ſend my Servant for him. He conſented that it ſhould be ſo, and I ſet forward.</p>
            <p>Coming to a Place where ſeveral Roads met, I was confounded to know the right, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſome time at a Stand, not knowing which to take: But hearing ſeveral Voices in an adjacent Barn, I made up to it on Foot, giving my Horſe to my Man. The nearer I approach'd, the more Noiſe they made; but I could not underſtand 'em. This awaken'd my Curioſity, and I ſtole ſoftly to the Barn, where I could obſerve through a Crevice (unſeen) upwards
wards
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0388100100:316"/>
of twenty Gypſies, ſitting in a Huddle, with a Child in the midſt ſtark naked, which they were rubbing over with Walnut-Shells; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time it cry'd they ſet up that confus'd Noiſe. But I was very much ſurpriz'd to find in that Child the Features of that I had ſeen the Night before at my Country Landlord's. I beckon'd my Servant to come near with my Horſes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arm'd, I made to the Barn Door, and forc'd it open. I ask'd 'em, in an imperious Manner, what they were doing with that Child; and further affirm'd they had ſtole it from ſuch a Place, giving them to underſtand I had People coming to apprehend 'em. Upon hearing this, they all took to their Heels; and ſome (I found) that had come there with Crutches, ran very nimbly away without 'em; but the Child was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. I now began to conſider with my ſelf what I had done; and that I had gotten a Child, but did not know what to do with it. They had rubb'd the poor thing all over with the green Walnut-Shells, that made it look like one of their Fraternity. By good Fortune they had left his Cloaths behind 'em, as alſo ſome Rags, which I ſuppoſe were to be put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the others.</p>
            <p>My man and I dreſs'd it as well as we could, and aukwardly enough; but when we had finiſh'd (notwithſtanding my Haſte) I reſolv'd to go back again, and enquire into this Affair. When we came to the Inn, I gave the Infant to the Care of the Woman of the Houſe till my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and underſtanding <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> was gone to Reſt, I proceeded to my Hoſt's Houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbing him. When we arriv'd there, I met the Woman at the Door. Pray, (ſaid I to her) good Woman, where's the Child that I ſaw here laſt Night? Where's the Child? (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0388100100:317"/>
the Woman ſnappingly) why the Child's in his Cradle aſleep. Let me ſee it; ſaid I. No, ſaid ſhe, I won't diſturb it for you, nor no one elſe. I told her peremptorily I would ſee it that Inſtant, in ſpight of her, for I fear'd ſome foul Play. She ſeeing me reſolute, and lighting from my Horſe; Well Sir, ſeeing you are ſo deſirous (ſaid ſhe) I'll go and bring it to you. When ſhe was gone, I began to imagine my ſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, and that Children might be very like, without being the ſame; but I knew a Guinea would ſoon reconcile her to my Rudeneſs. I ſtaid waiting a conſiderable time, taken up with ſeveral Thoughts; and not obſerving how long I had waited, till my Man told me the old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was long a coming. I began to call, and no body anſwering, I order'd him to go in, and ſee for her. He came out again, and told me ſhe was not in the Houſe, nor any one elſe; but that he believ'd ſhe had ſlip'd out of the back Door, and got away through the Garden. I began to think there was ſomething very extraordinary in the Adventure of the Child, and reſolv'd to be ſtrict in the Examination. I enter'd the Houſe my ſelf, and ſearch'd, but to no Purpoſe. I ſent my Man in the mean time in purſuit of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But he return'd without her. There was never a Neighbouring-houſe to enquire, no near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Village where I had left the Child. So I had juſt got on Horſeback in order to go back, when I perceiv'd the Man coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own Houſe. I ſpur'd on to meet him, and he ſeem'd much concern'd; I ſeiz'd him by the Collar, and told him, I came to ſecure him, for the Murder of the Child I ſaw at his Houſe laſt Night. The Man was in ſuch a terrible Fright at what I ſaid, that he was more dead than alive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sure Sir, ſaid he, it can't be, it is not
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0388100100:318"/>
murder'd. I bid him produce it, or he ſhould be try'd for it. In ſhort, I frighted the poor Fellow ſo much, that he told me, if I would have a little Patience, he would tell me all that he knew concerning it (ſtill crying, I hope it is not murder'd.) I told him the Child was ſafe. We went back to his Houſe, where after the Fellow had a little compos'd himſelf, he made me the following Relation.</p>
            <p>About three Years ago, a Gentlewoman came to my Wife, and made a Bargain with her to keep this Infant, and by paying us handſomely, we imagin'd it belong'd to ſome Perſon of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; for we receiv'd ten Pounds every Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that before it was due. The Lady would often take the Child for a Day or two, and return it again. My Wife, being a worldly Woman, laid ſeveral Plots how to know the truth of the Child, but to no Purpoſe; but by all Circumſtances we believ'd the Parents did not care for owning it. One Day my Wife told me ſhe had a Deſign in her Head, but ſhe would not diſcloſe it, till ſhe could be ſure of ſucceeding; and when the Lady came the next time to take the Child away for a Day as uſual, my Wife was in Conference with her for ſome time. And when ſhe was gone, ſhe told me that ſhe had prevail'd upon the Lady to pay her one hundred Pounds before hand, and that ſhe brought her to it, by telling her we ſhould make a Purchaſe of the Houſe we live in. In ſhort, my Wife (who wears the Breeches) made me conſent to carry on the Deceit; and the next Day the Lady brought the Child, and the hundred Pound and gave it my Wife, without any thing under my Hand, and left us in a ſmall time after. When ſhe was gone, my Wife diſcours'd me after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0388100100:319"/>
Husband, we have now one hundred and fifty Pounds (for we had been very ſaving) beſides our Goods, and Cattle, which will fetch us one hundred more. With this Money we may go into my Country (which was the <hi>Iſle of Man)</hi> and live contentedly all our Lives, without any fears of bad Crops, and ill Markets. Well, but ſaid I, what will become of the Child. I quickly found by her Expreſſions that ſhe reſolv'd to murder it. I was ſtruck with Horror at her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and notwithſtanding her violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, oppos'd her in't; and told her, upon no Conditions would I conſent to do ſo barbarous a Deed. I found her ſo fix'd upon the deſign of Murder, that I was at laſt, as the lighteſt Evil, obliged to conſent to her ſelling it to a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Gypſies;</hi> but with the greateſt Reluctance in the World; which was executed this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But we had diſpos'd of every thing before hand, with Intention to have gone for <hi>Briſtol</hi> two Days hence; for we were aſſur'd the Lady would not come again for ſome time.</p>
            <p>When he had done, I inform'd him how I came to meet with the Child. I then began to examine if he did not know where the Lady liv'd; and at laſt he confeſs'd he dogg'd her to her Houſe one Day, ſet on by his Wife, but would never diſcover it to her, for fear of her playing ſome Trick. I prevail'd with him to go with me, and ſhew me the Houſe, with the promiſe of a Reward, and letting him go after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. We ſet out (after he had got a Horſe) and in two Hours arriv'd at a pleaſant Houſe, ſurrounded by a ſmall River, and almoſt cover'd with Trees. I ſtopp'd ſome time to view it, and through a little Avenue ſaw two Women gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flowers; one had her Face turn'd towards us, which the Man ſaid was the Woman that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0388100100:320"/>
us'd to come to ſee the Child, and that was the Place ſhe carry'd it to. I order'd my Man to take the Horſes to the next Town, about half a Mile off, and come to me again. But I needed not have bid mine Hoſt to have gone about his Buſineſs; for he being fearful of the Event, got away without our perceiving it.</p>
            <p>When my Man was gone, I walk'd about to view the Houſe, but I had loſt ſight of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and it began to rain again. I ſtood up for Shelter from the Weather under a large Oak; and had but juſt got there, when a Woman came out of the Gate, with her Miſtreſs's Service, to invite me in. I was very well pleas'd with the Invitation, and went into the Houſe, where I was met by the Gentlewoman, a very handſome Lady. She told me, as I look'd like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe deſir'd I would take Shelter there till the Storm was over. I return'd her the Thanks her Civility deſerv'd, and we ſat down, but were immediately interrupted with ringing at the Gate; and I perceiv'd, through a ſmall Window, a Gentleman in a Scarlet-cloak a-light from his Horſe, and go in quite through the Houſe. The Lady begg'd my Pardon, and told me, ſhe was obliged to go keep another Lady Company while that Perſon was there, but would wait on me aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as poſſible again. As my Curioſity had brought me there, I had no Thoughts of going away till I had ſatisfy'd it in ſome meaſure. I could hear the Man's Voice very plain, who ſeem'd to threaten a Lady with a great many Hardſhips as to her Fortune, if ſhe would not conſent to his Love. The Lady anſwer'd in ſo low a Voice, that I could not hear what ſhe ſaid, but I found her Anſwers did but inrage him the more. They talk'd a great while, and at laſt they ſeem'd to be ſilent. I hearing the Door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0388100100:321"/>
ſtep'd back into the Room where the Lady left me. She came to me again, and ſat down. I hope, Sir, (ſaid ſhe) you'll pardon my Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but I could not wait on you before. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, (return'd I) I ought to beg your Pardon for taking Poſſeſſion of your Houſe here, who am an utter Stranger to you. We were interrupted in our Compliments, by the Voice of a Perſon that ſcream'd out Murder! Murder!—We both ran out, and ſhe coming to the Door where the Noiſe was, we found it ſhut, and the Voice ſtill calling out for Help. I burſt it open with my Foot, and, with my Sword in my Hand, ran into the Room, where I found the Gentleman that came in the Cloak, endeavouring to force a Lady. I gave him a Stroke upon the Head, and bid him turn about and defend himſelf; which he did, with many bitter Exclamations. But after ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I had the good Fortune to diſarm him; and he having receiv'd ſeveral Wounds, drop'd down with loſs of Blood. The Lady he had attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſtill in a Swoon; and the Buſtle had brought ſeveral Women Servants into the Room. I retir'd into the Chamber I came from, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd the Lady to take ſome care of the Wretch, who deſerv'd Death; but I wiſh'd might ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, to prevent farther Trouble. She took my Advice, and ſent to the next Town for a Surgeon, who ſoon came, and my Man along with him by Accident. Perceiving his Wounds were not dangerous, (for I ſtood by while the Surgeon dreſs'd him) and finding the Houſe in too much Confuſion to be better inform'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Child, I was about to take my Leave. But the Lady I had ſo timely reſcu'd, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd her Fright, deſir'd ſhe might thank me for ſo great a Providence. I was eaſily perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtay, and immediately a Lady came into the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0388100100:322"/>
Room. But, good God! what Tranſports did I feel, when in that Lady, I beheld every Feature of my dear Mrs. <hi>Villars.</hi> Our Eyes were fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other, and the Sight of me rais'd ſuch a tumult of Joy in her Breaſt, that combating with her unſettled Heart, ſhe fell down in a Swoon again. The other Lady at firſt knew not the Meaning of our Diſorder: But when I call'd her my dear Wife, and other extravagant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of my Love, ſhe ſoon gueſs'd the Truth, and ſeem'd as much tranſported as we were. Words would but wrong the Sentiments we felt for each other. Therefore, let the Reader (if poſſible) gueſs the Joy of two Lovers meeting, after imagining each other no longer in this World. We thought it was all a Dream; but at laſt being convinc'd of the Reality, we ſent privately for the Parſon, and were ty'd by the outward Ceremony of the Church, whoſe Hearts had been divinely united long before; and that Night I took once more Poſſeſſion of what I valu'd above all the World could give.</p>
            <p>The next Day, I ſent for <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> to partake in our Joy, but was inform'd his Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition had increas'd upon him ſo much, that it was dangerous to remove him. This was ſome allay to my Joy, for I had a real Friendſhip for him. I told my dear Wife, the Obligation I had to his Father. I now deſir'd to know the Particulars of her wonderful Eſcape, which ſhe related to me after the following manner.</p>
            <p>You know, ſaid ſhe, when we parted at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinez,</hi> our Hearts foreboded ſomething would follow prejudicial to our Loves. I was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Eſcape; if I had, it is very probable I might have avoided the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that befell me: But he got a Veſſel to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him to <hi>Sallee,</hi> (as he inform'd me, when I was
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0388100100:323"/>
their Priſoner again) and by the Way, met with his Maſter <hi>Hamet;</hi> who wrote a Letter to the Governor of <hi>Mammora,</hi> and ſent <hi>Muſtapha</hi> with it, while he intended to wait near the Coaſt to guard us back. When they had ſeiz'd me, they hurry'd me away immediately on board a Veſſel, and ſail'd upon the Inſtant; and before Night met with <hi>Hamet,</hi> where I was carry'd on Board. He upbraided me in Terms, that gave me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect worſe Treatment from him; but I told him, rather than ſubmit to his nauſeous Love, I would ſtarve my ſelf to Death, if I could find no other means to rid me of Life. The next Day a Storm ariſing of a ſudden, blew down one of their Maſts, and drove 'em back again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sight of the Port of <hi>Mammora;</hi> but to avoid it, they ran beyond it, and the Storm continu'd. In the Evening it began to abate, and he ſteer'd his Courſe back again; but before it was dark a Ship appear'd in View. And notwithſtanding he had loſt ſeveral Men in a former Engagement, he reſolv'd to ſet upon this Veſſel; and it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Calm he got up to her with rowing. The other Veſſel knowing what ſhe was, began with us firſt, and fir'd very briskly.</p>
            <p>The Fight continu'd about an Hour, as near as I could gueſs; for all my Employment was to pray, that ſome lucky Shot would end that Life, which was ſo burthenſome to me. When the Noiſe of the Ordnance ceas'd, I had not Curioſity enough to go to ſee how Affairs ſtood. But judge my Surprize and Pleaſure, when I tell you the firſt Man that enter'd the Cabin, was the Mate that I had made Captain, as I mention'd to you in the Relation of my firſt Misfortune.</p>
            <p>How Madam! cry'd he, is it you! thank Heav'n my Voyage is at End. Come Madam, (continu'd he) I'll carry you to one that thinks

her Life a Burden till you are ſafe, being your Danger is owing to her. I had not Power to return him an Anſwer, or ask him who it was he meant, I was ſo confounded with Thought. He carry'd me on board of his own Ship, where he brought Mrs. <hi>Suſan</hi> to me. My Heart was ſo full of Content, that for a Moment you had ſlipt out of my Memory.</p>
            <p>The Ship of <hi>Hamet</hi>'s was juſt ſinking, for they had ſhot her between Wind and Water, and could not come to ſtop it. They had taken out as many of their Goods as the time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and all the Men that were wounded (before ſhe Sunk). I let 'em into your Story, and the mutual Affection we had; and in Return the Captain gave me the following Account of their getting away from <hi>Sallee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know, Madam, (ſaid he) the <hi>Moors</hi> were not very ſtrict in ſearching us; and I had at the firſt Sight of 'em (judging what they were) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd all the Merchants Money deſign'd for Trade, as well as what I had of my own about my Cloaths, and in a great Fur Cap, which I wore upon my Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hamet</hi> being ſatisfy'd with you, and what he found beſides, would not ſell us for Slaves, but gave us the Liberty of walking about the Town, with a ſmall Allowance of Proviſion, till we could ſend a Perſon to <hi>England</hi> for a thouſand Pounds, which was the Ranſom of both Ship and Men. In a little time, I became acquainted with one of the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Sallee,</hi> whom I prevail'd upon by the force of Money to buy the Ship, and pay for our Ranſom; which he did, without any one's concerning themſelves about it. We did all we could to find you out, but to no purpoſe; ſo we were obliged to ſet Sail for <hi>England.</hi>

In our Voyage home, Mrs. <hi>Suſan</hi> inform'd we with your Story, not concealing even her own Part in't; and I found her ſo ſincere in her Repentance, that I could not help pitying her, which ſoon roſe a ſofter Paſſion; and aſſoon as we arriv'd in <hi>England,</hi> the Ceremony of the Church compleated my Happineſs. We acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Kendrick,</hi> your Ladyſhip's Guardian and Steward, with your Misfortune; who, with the Advice of us, fitted the Ship out in your Name, with a ſufficient Quantity of Money for your Ranſom, if it were poſſible for us to hear of you; and by meeting with you now, we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd what we intended. I return'd 'em many Thanks, (eſpecially Mrs. <hi>Suſan,</hi> who would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her Husband, in hopes to meet with me.) I deſir'd Captain <hi>Morrice,</hi> (which is the Name of Mrs. <hi>Suſan</hi>'s Husband) to ſteer towards <hi>Mammora,</hi> but he told me it was not ſafe: For as there was a War proclaim'd between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the Ambaſſador could not anſwer it if he did not make us Prize; and we were further inform'd by one of the <hi>Renegado</hi> Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that he was very well aſſur'd they were ſail'd for <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Notice we directed our Courſe, with this Hope, that you would ſoon arrive in <hi>England,</hi> and find me out; for I remember'd in the Story of my Misfortunes, I gave you Marks enough to let you know where I was to be found. Before we made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, I found my ſelf with Child, and the very Imagination had like to have coſt me my Life, for fear the Father of the unborn Infant would not come time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſave my Credit; for though I was well aſſur'd of your Honour, yet I knew the cenſuring World would be apt to blame my Conduct. I
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0388100100:326"/>
could hide nothing from the faithful <hi>Suſan,</hi> who join'd her Fears with mine.</p>
            <p>When we came into <hi>Briſtol</hi> Channel, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with <hi>Suſan</hi> about my Management, and I at laſt reſolv'd to live Private, till I could hear ſome News of you. But I was obliged to let Mr. <hi>Kenderick</hi> my Steward into the Knowledge of my Arrival, tho' he was a Stranger to my Condition.</p>
            <p>I ſent to <hi>London,</hi> in hopes of hearing ſome News of you; but having kept the Name of your Uncle a Secret in your Relation, our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours prov'd fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>My Melancholy encreas'd with my Condition; and for fear of a Diſcovery, I went into <hi>Wales,</hi> with a Relation of Mrs. <hi>Suſan</hi>'s, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd of a Boy, that prov'd the greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to my ſinking Heart; for in his Face was every Feature of his dear Father. I brought him back again here, and had him put to Nurſe, as a Child to a Relation of Mrs. <hi>Suſan</hi>'s, and had reſolv'd but this very Day to have ſent for him home, that I might always have the Satisfaction of having him in my Sight.</p>
            <p>My Steward, finding I was under a Neceſſity of living Private, began to talk to me of Love; and often proceeded ſo far (after finding I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd his Paſſion) to tell me, if I would not conſent to make him my Husband, he would take care my Eſtate ſhould come into his Hands. Though I could have ſoon broke his Deſigns as to my Fortune, yet my ſolitary Dwelling pleas'd me ſo well, that I gave him good Words, which did but more encourage his Inſolence, till it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to that Pitch you ſo happily deliver'd me from.</p>

I ſoon found, by my Wife's Relation, that the Infant I had ſo marvellouſly ſav'd, was our own Child. When I related the Accident of meeting with the Child, my Wife expreſs'd ſo much Feat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Terror, Tenderneſs and Joy, that I thought the different Paſſions would have taken away her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. By this we may learn, there is a ruling Providence that regulates every Action of our Lives, when they tend to Virtue.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Kendrick,</hi> (the Perſon that made the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon my Wife) was ſoon inform'd of our happy Meeting; and his Wounds mending e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day, he begg'd we would favour him with a Viſit, (which we comply'd with) where he ask'd Pardon for all paſt Offences in ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Manner, that we were eaſily prevail'd upon to forgive him.</p>
            <p>He ſent for all the Books of Accounts and Writings, that belong'd to my Wife's Eſtate, and deliver'd 'em up to us.</p>
            <p>The ſame Day Captain <hi>Morrice</hi> arriv'd from <hi>France;</hi> where he went by the Deſire of my Wife, as her laſt Hope, to know if he could gain any Intelligence of me. He was ſo very diligent in his Commiſſion, that he got to the Speech of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de St. Olon,</hi> who inform'd him of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the Veſſel, and returning, and of my Voyage to <hi>Italy.</hi> I rewarded him by ſeveral handſome Preſents for his Trouble, and found in all his Actions, a downright blunt ſincere Honeſty, which drew me into a Friendſhip for him. I now began to think of <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Illneſs, and reſolv'd to go with my Wife to make him a Viſit; and my dear Wife was ſo impatient to embrace the Child, ſhe would not let me ſtay to finiſh my Affairs with Mr. <hi>Kendrick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we were upon our Journey, we were met by a Relation of mine, Son to that barbarous

Uncle that had Kidnap'd me. He was in the Country when I arriv'd at <hi>London.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Injury I had ſuffer'd from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I could not help receiving him with the utmoſt Affection; for we were both of an Age, and very like as to our Perſons, being brought up together till the Death of my Father, which created a Friendſhip for each other.</p>
            <p>He brought me a Packet from <hi>Italy,</hi> and in it one inclos'd from <hi>Don Jaques,</hi> ſent from St. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdor.</hi> I broke open that firſt, which was as follows.</p>

What Words can expreſs the Amazement I felt, at the reading this laſt Letter! My Thoughts were confounded in Thought, and a Chaos of Ideas poſſeſs'd my Brain. I was in ſo much Confuſion, that I thought of returning home again, to conſider of this ſtrange Turn. Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Circumſtances convinc'd me, how blind I was in not diſcovering it ſooner. My Soul was immediately fill'd with the moſt tender Pity; and I had not the uſe of Words to declare my Sentiments to my Wife and Couſin. Sometimes I would imagine it was all a fictitious Dream; yet at laſt I was not diſpleas'd, that I had it in my Power to reſtore to <hi>Don Jaques</hi> his long loſt Daughter. My Wife was as much concern'd as I was, and my Couſin could hardly believe it. I ſoon found that ſhe had taken care the Packet ſhould not fall into my Hands; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd me ſhe would not have her Diſguiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd. The next Day we reſolv'd to viſit her, and form my Reſolution from my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>When we arriv'd at the Inn, we found her dreſs'd at a Table, with Paper, Pens and Ink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, but very weak. I preſented my Wife and Couſin to her. She ſaluted 'em, and ſeem'd mightily pleas'd with my good Fortune, and was very much concern'd her Indiſpoſition would not admit her waiting on me, to partake in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Her Weakneſs was ſo prevalent, that ſhe could hardly utter her Words. She knew nothing of receiving the Packet from my Couſin, but after we had ſat ſome time, I gave her the Letter from her Father; which, aſſoon as ſhe had read, ſhe fell backward upon the Bed in a Swoon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0388100100:332"/>
The Noiſe we made at this Accident brought ſeveral People into the Room; and among the reſt my Landlady, who it ſeems had fell deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in Love with her, as imagining her to be a Man. She made ſuch aukward Complainings, that, if our Minds had been at eaſe, would have produc'd much Mirth; but among her Actions, ſhe unbutton'd her Cloaths, to give her Breath, and ſoon diſcover'd her Miſtake in the Object of her Wiſhes. When ſhe found by her Breaſts that ſhe was a Woman, ſhe ran down Stairs with the utmoſt Precipitation, and left us alone to recover her. When we had brought her to her Senſes again, ſhe ſoon found that we had diſcover'd her Sex; and the Grief and Shame at the Accident had like to have thrown her again into her Swooning. It was ſome time before we could bring her to her ſelf: But, ſhe found by my Diſcourſe, that I underſtood the whole Secret.</p>
            <p>After a long Pauſe, ſaid ſhe, I did not intend to let my Frailty be known to you till after my Death; but ſince it is diſcover'd, I beg you will have ſome Regard to my Memory, and I ſhall die contented. I begg'd her not to talk of Death, but live to comfort her griev'd Parents. It is too late, ſaid ſhe, to talk of any Comfort, for I have call'd my greateſt Friend Death to my Aid, who is juſt now arriv'd. Upon uttering theſe Words, a deadly Paleneſs poſſeſs'd her Face, and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſeiz'd her Limbs: She had juſt Strength enough to declare to us that ſhe had taken a Doſe of Poiſon, provided for the Occaſion, bought of an Apothecary of the Town; and that ſhe was juſt going to write a Letter to me, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by our ſudden Appearance, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were only to ſee her ſecretly bury'd, and if poſſible to have conceal'd her Sex and Story from the World. She had hardly made an End, before
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0388100100:333"/>
her Speech forſook her, and Life in all Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance fled the beauteous Dwelling. My Wife was not preſent at this Accident, being her eager Deſire had carry'd her to her Child; but ſhe came in before it was over. My Couſin ſeem'd more oppreſs'd with Grief than any of us, for Love had taken full Poſſeſſon of his Heart.</p>
            <p>While Sorrow had lock'd up all our Tongues, the Apothecary came in, in a ſtrange Confuſion; for the Report had ſoon diſpers'd it ſelf all over that little Village. Sir, ſaid he to me, don't be concern'd at the Condition you ſee the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in, for he is not dead, he has only took a ſleeping Potion. I partly gueſs'd his Deſign, when he apply'd to me for Poiſon; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Price he paid for it, convinc'd me it was for ſome ſiniſter Deſign; and therefore I happily impos'd upon him.</p>
            <p>This News reviv'd us all again, eſpecially my Couſin, who I thought would have gone di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted for Joy; and to ſee his impatient watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her Life's return, (if we may call it ſo) only gave me further Proof, that one Look is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to fix Love for ever in the Soul. The Apothecary, during this interval of Life and Death, pour'd Cordials into her Mouth to help the Operation; and at laſt ſhe open'd her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing Eyes, and gaz'd around her, as if ſhe had been in another World: But we ſoon convinc'd her of the Apothecary's Deceit, at which ſhe ſeem'd in the utmoſt Confuſion, and gave us to underſtand that Life was forc'd upon her againſt her Inclination, and ſhe would ſhake it off.</p>
            <p>We gave her all the Comfort we were capable of; and my Wife told her if ſhe talk'd any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death, it was only that ſhe could not bear to ſee us happy. This as it were rous'd her from her Lethargy. Well then, ſaid ſhe, I will
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0388100100:334"/>
live, if it be only to convince you, that I am pleas'd to ſee my Captain bleſs'd (for ſhe would always call me ſo.) After we had a little compos'd her, we left her with my Couſin, to look after our Child, who was in the ſame Place; which had prov'd the ſecret Inſtinct of Nature; for at the firſt Sight in the Houſe of his unnatural Nurſe, I could not help feeling a tender Regard for him. When we had ſatisfy'd our Inn, we prevail'd upon <hi>Donna Bianca</hi> (now no longer <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand)</hi> to come into the Coach with us, and we arriv'd that Evening at <hi>Briſtol;</hi> where we took Poſſeſſion of the Houſe (which Captain <hi>Kendrick</hi> had liv'd in) that belong'd to my Wife. We ſtaid ſome time there to ſettle my Wife's Affairs, and as much to recover <hi>Donna Bianca</hi>'s Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>My Couſin by his Aſſiduity gain'd very much of her Eſteem, but ſhe freely declar'd ſhe had no Room in her Heart for Love: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, with much Importunity, we prevail'd upon her to accept him for a Husband; and her Eſteem ſoon came up to a more tender Paſſion. Aſſoon as the Ceremony was over, we took a Journey to <hi>London</hi> to ſettle our Affairs there, and provide for my expected Gueſts.</p>
            <p>One Morning as we were purſuing our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, coming near the Skirts of a Wood, we heard ſeveral Groans, which alarm'd us; but as we had too many People about us arm'd, to ſear any thing, we came out of the Coach to know the Reaſon: Where we found a Woman wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in Blood, being ſtabb'd in ſeveral Places with a Sword. When I came to take a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er View, I found it was my former Maſter (the Watch-maker's) Wife. I could not help having Compaſſion for any Perſon in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, therefore order'd her to be taken up and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0388100100:335"/>
put in the Coach. <hi>Donna Bianca</hi> open'd her Breaſt, and ſtopp'd her Wounds as well as ſhe could, till we could get a Surgeon that I had order'd to be ſent for. She ſoon knew me, and cry'd out, Sure Heaven has ſent you that know my Guilt to be Witneſs of my Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: The Wrongs I have done my Husband have purſu'd me to my Grave. When I had robb'd him of all I could lay my Hands on, I made my Eſcape to <hi>Ireland,</hi> chang'd my Name, and ſet up for a greater Fortune than I really was. I had many Suitors, but Heaven, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me, made me place my Affections on a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that courted me for my Money: And tho' I ſoon underſtood he had but very little Eſtate, yet Love prevail'd with me to make him my Husband. He ſoon ſpent both his own and my Fortune, and by contracting many Debts was forc'd to fly for <hi>England;</hi> and finding no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, took to the Highway, where he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many Robberies. He lodg'd me in a neighbouring Village; but our Place of Meeting was generally in this Wood, for fear of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. This Morning he came, according to Appointment, where he began his Diſcourſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Manner. I had no Inclination for you when I firſt marry'd you, but now I utterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor you, therefore am reſolv'd to part with you: But I have another Reaſon beſides my Hatred to you, which is this; I have it in my Power to marry an old Woman, very rich; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary to ſend you out of the World, for fear our Marriage ſhould come to her Ears, and ſpoil my Fortune. He follow'd his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with theſe Wounds, which he gave me, and rode into the Wood, without my once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to open my Mouth; for Aſtoniſhment had ty'd up my Tongue. I told her, I hop'd
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0388100100:336"/>
Heaven had given her all its Puniſhment in this World. That's all the Hope I have, ſaid ſhe, and in my unfeigned Repentance; for I feel Death approaching. We obſerv'd ſhe was juſt expiring; and before the Surgeon came, ſhe gave up her laſt Breath, calling upon Heaven for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. I gave Orders for her Funeral, and ſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Murderer, but to no Purpoſe. But I heard he was taken for the High-way, ſome time after, and executed at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd the Murder of his Wife. Thus we ſee the Hand of Heaven, though ſlow in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, yet always overtakes the Guilty. When I had given Directions for her Funeral, we purſu'd our Journey, and arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Antonio</hi> and his Lady arriv'd firſt, in a private Capacity; not caring to make a Show according to their Birth, to be taken Notice of. And in a few Days after came <hi>Don Jaques</hi> and his Lady, in a Ship of their own, in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the <hi>Iſabella</hi> which my Lieutenant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that had ſprung a Leak which oblig'd her to put into <hi>Lisbon</hi> to refit, where <hi>Don Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> joyfully met with her.</p>
            <p>I had deſir'd <hi>Donna Bianca</hi> once more to put on her Boy's Cloaths; for I intended agreeably to ſurprize her Parents.</p>
            <p>I was oblig'd to take Lodgings for <hi>Don Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi>'s Family, being they intended to take a convenient Houſe in the City. Aſſoon as mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Careſſes were over, Grief again took Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Souls for the Loſs of their Child. After condoling with 'em ſome time, I begg'd 'em to hope for the beſt, and that it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hear of her again. They ſhook their Heads, and told me that Thought was long gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0388100100:337"/>
over, and they had no Hope but in Time to wear away their unhappy Loſs.</p>
            <p>I told 'em I had a Kinſman, as much as I could remember the Features of their beautiful Daughter, as like her as a Man could be like a Woman. They expreſs'd a great Deſire to ſee him. I told 'em I had invited him with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relation to ſup with us on purpoſe. We had taken care before, that <hi>Donna Bianca</hi> ſhould Ombre her Face, and ſpeak nothing but <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on purpoſe to carry on the Deceit. 'Till the time of their coming, we ſpent in relating our Accidents in the Voyage. I told 'em how much I was ſurpriz'd at the Likeneſs of my Couſin to their Daughter: for I had given 'em to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it was a Relation I had never ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I left <hi>England:</hi> which was Truth.</p>
            <p>When the Time I had appointed came, <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Bianca</hi> and my Couſin enter'd. I preſented 'em to <hi>Don Jaques</hi> and his Wife, as my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and they ſaluted 'em as utter Strangers. But when they ſaw and heard <hi>Donna Bianca,</hi> they burſt into Tears at the great Reſemblance in both Voice and Features, as they ſaid, to their Daughter. She carry'd it on as long as ſhe could, ſpeaking <hi>Engliſh</hi> all the while; but at laſt their Tears prevail'd ſo much upon her Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſhe begg'd leave to retire, but would return immediately. I made an Apology for my Kinſman to <hi>Don Jaques</hi> and his Wife, and told 'em he would return in a very little time. The Space of their Abſence was fill'd with Sighs and Tears; and as I knew their Grief would ſoon be over, I never attempted to comfort 'em.</p>
            <p>When they were ready, they ſent a Servant to tell me a Gentleman wanted to ſpeak with
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0388100100:338"/>
me. I retir'd, and came in again immediately, and told 'em our Company would be encreas'd, for another Relation and his Wife were juſt coming in to ſup with us; and upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant my Couſin enter'd, leading by the Hand <hi>Donna Bianca.</hi> They both ran and kneel'd down before <hi>Don Jaques</hi> and his Wife. At the Sight of their Daughter, the Mother fell backward in the Chair in a Swoon; and <hi>Don Jaques</hi> was in ſuch a Surprize that he could not open his Mouth, but expreſs'd his Joy by Tears, Kiſſes, and Embraces; and his Lady coming to her ſelf, had like to have ſtifled her with her Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
            <p>They did not ask any reaſonable Queſtions till the Torrent of their Joy was poured out. After the firſt Tranſports were over, <hi>Donna Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anca</hi> told her own Story. She ſaid, the firſt time I din'd at their Houſe in St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> Love flew into her Heart; and knowing the Modeſty due to her Sex, ſhe was reſolv'd never to diſcover it till ſhe found the State of mine: Yet finding her Paſſion daily increaſe, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Day of my Departure, ſhe procured ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly the Habit of a Man, with all other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and convey'd herſelf on Board in the Boat that carry'd the Preſents her Father had ſent me; and counterfeited the Letter ſhe gave me as from her Father. Every thing anſwered my Wiſh, ſaid ſhe; but I ſoon found my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had no Heart to beſtow. It is needleſs to tell how many bitter Sighs and Tears that Knowledge coſt me: But it is now buried in Oblivion. Then ſhe proceeded to beg their Pardon for her raſh Folly, as ſhe call'd it; and they were too much overjoy'd not to forgive her every thing; and they expreſt a great deal
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0388100100:339"/>
of Satisfaction in that they could now call me their Relation. We liv'd in all the Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imaginable, returning Heaven our grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thanks for its bounteous Mercy. And now I am ſettled, I'll take Leave of my Reader with this Couplet of the Poet:

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Dangers at Sea are certainly more imminent than thoſe on Shore; even in the faireſt Weather, the Space is very ſmall betwen this World and the next.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſopher was, in my Opinion, much in the right, when ask'd by a Friend if he would go to a neighbouring Iſland in the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpont</hi> to hunt, anſwer'd, if he ſhould be guilty of ſo much Folly, he ſhould have no other Hope but of returning ſafe back, for thoſe that truſted their Lives to the Sea ventur'd with a changing Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>I embark'd on Board Captain <hi>Cox,</hi> bound for <hi>Charles-town</hi> in <hi>Carolina,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and his Family, and arriv'd ſafe there without any
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0388100100:342"/>
great Hazard, juſt when Captain <hi>Moor</hi> had made a Deſcent upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> a Plantation to the Southward of <hi>Carolina,</hi> and return'd with conſiderable Booty. By ſome of the <hi>Colony</hi> his Proceedings were cenſur'd with Injuſtice, being the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Rupture between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> but all Stratagems are lawful in War.</p>
            <p>Some time after, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> reſenting the Uſage of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> fitted out five Sail of Men of War, and ſeveral Tranſports, to repay them in their own Coin.</p>
            <p>They landed eight hundred Men in the Bay, and ſent two Trumpeters to Sir <hi>Nathaniel John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> at that time Governour of <hi>Charles-town,</hi> to ſurrender; but he ſent 'em word back, as the Place was intruſted to him by the Queen his Miſtreſs, he was reſolv'd to hold it out to the laſt. The Meſſengers inform'd their Admiral of Sir <hi>Nathaniel</hi>'s Reſolution, and likewiſe added, that the Town was too well Mann'd to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily taken. He thought better on't, recall'd his Men, and ſail'd away.</p>
            <p>This Attempt very much alarm'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and put 'em upon fortifying <hi>Charles-town,</hi> which at preſent may laugh at all Attempts from a Foreign Foe, or the native <hi>Indians,</hi> who us'd before to infeſt 'em daily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles-town,</hi> or <hi>Charles</hi> City, the Capital of <hi>Carolina,</hi> is ſituated upon a Neck of Land form'd by a River on each ſide, (nam'd <hi>Aſhley</hi> and <hi>Cooper</hi> Rivers, from the firſt Plantations) well ſtor'd with Fiſh. There was when I was there but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different wooden Church; but before I left the Place, Subſcriptions were taken in to build a regular Stone Building. There are upwards of a thouſand Houſes, very neatly built, with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens almoſt to every Houſe. There is Plenty of every Thing for the Life of Man to be
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0388100100:343"/>
found at <hi>Charles-town.</hi> It lies in 32 deg. 40 min. Northern Latitude. The Trade of this Place is more conſiderable for its Bigneſs than any other Plantation in <hi>America;</hi> it being the Southermoſt Settlement belonging to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> upon the Continent; and I have been inform'd they have Dealings three hundred Leagues up the Country, which is very much facilitated by the numerous navigable Rivers that come from the Mountains. The Climate is very wholeſome. Tho' moſt <hi>Europeans</hi> have at their firſt Arrival the Diſtemper of the Country, which proceeds from Change of Air and Diet; yet I had the good Fortune to eſcape with a ſwell'd Arm, which had like to have ended in the Mortification of a Finger; but I was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily cur'd by the Care and Advice of Madam <hi>Rhett,</hi> the only good Surgeon on the Place: Tho' were I to enumerate her other good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, my ſmall Tract would exceed in Bulk my Intentions: I ſhall only ſay, another <hi>Dacter</hi> may be found in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſtaid at <hi>Charles-town</hi> upwards of eight Months, and was well entertain'd by the courteous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; for I muſt own Pleaſure as well as Profit induc'd me to travel, though I have no Inclination that way now.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> the Perſon concern'd with me in Trade, was oblig'd to go to <hi>Bermuda,</hi> being Secretary and Provoſt-Marſhal of the <hi>Summer-Iſlands;</hi> and in a ſhort time after I follow'd with his Family. We met with no other Accident than a large Shark that follow'd our Veſſel ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Days together, and the Maſter told me he was well aſſur'd ſome One on Board would die. I laugh'd at his Superſtition, and endeavour'd to rally him out of it, but he ſtill perſiſted in his Opinion. When the Shark appear'd firſt,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0388100100:344"/>
every Body was in good Health, but in three Days time a Woman Paſſenger expir'd of a Fever; whom we committed to the Waves, and was probably entombed in the Bowels of the Shark, for he took his leave of us the ſame Day. The Maſter told me he had made it his Obſervation for ſeveral Years, and was never once out. 'Tis not impoſſible but the Shark at Sea has the ſame Inſtinct as the Vulture at Land.</p>
            <p>When I arriv'd at St. <hi>George</hi>'s, the Capital of <hi>Bermudas,</hi> I was as well pleas'd with the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and Inhabitants as I was at <hi>Carolina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>George</hi>'s Town is ſeated in the Bottom of a Bay of the ſame Name, and is very well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd. It contains about two hundred Houſes, with a Church ſomething handſomer than that of <hi>Charles-town.</hi> The Incumbent was the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. <hi>Holland,</hi> a Perſon of a good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I had a Preſent, an <hi>Antelope</hi>'s Foot ſet in Gold, for a Tobacco-Stopper, which I was to deliver to the Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> his Patron; but it was loſt among my other Things in my Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.</p>
            <p>There is a perpetual Spring to be obſerv'd in theſe Iſlands, and the old Leaves never drop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are thruſt out by new ones. Their Fruit is in Bloſſoms, Buds, and Ripe at the ſame time. The Air is generally temperate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubilous, but now and then troubled with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Thunder and Lightning; and I have been ſhown ſeveral Rocks that they ſay were ſplit by Lightning.</p>
            <p>I was informed by a Gentleman that had coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along theſe Iſlands, that their Number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to 378, but above 300 of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no other Name than Rocks; and moſt of the others that are inhabited have not above half a dozen Houſes upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0388100100:345"/>
The Soil of all the cultivated Iſlands is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, being very fruitful; and ſome People ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they were once join'd, making one intire Iſland, but were divided as they are now by the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sea: And what gives them ground for this Opinion is, that the Waves daily leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the ſmall ones. But this is only Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to ſay that the former Inhabitants gain'd much by Pirates; and even ſome that had large Plantations when I was there, were little better at firſt than Sea-Robbers.</p>
            <p>The late Queen being inform'd of it, order'd Mr. <hi>Larkins</hi> with a Commiſſion to try Pirates, where-ever they reſorted in her Dominions in <hi>America.</hi> I happen'd to be at <hi>Bermuda</hi> when he arriv'd there. He acquainted the People in Power with his Commiſſion, but met with a very cold Reception from 'em: But however, he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his Deſign, and iſſu'd out Warrants to ſeize the ſuſpected Perſons. Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> as Provoſt-Marſhal, was oblig'd to execute the Warrants; but he met with Reſiſtance every where, and was very ill us'd by ſome of them, even to the Hazard of his Life.</p>
            <p>The Governour, whoſe Name was <hi>Bennet,</hi> as he repreſented the Monarch of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould have aſſiſted Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and Mr. <hi>Larkins;</hi> but whether he was afraid of offending the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, or not enquiring truly into the Matter, Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and Mr. <hi>Larkins</hi> were ſeiz'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon. Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> firſt made his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, and arriv'd ſafe in <hi>England;</hi> where he ſet forth his Caſe, and had all the Redreſs he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd: He was order'd back, and re-inſtated in his former Poſt.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that oppos'd him, I am inform'd, had repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Letters from <hi>England,</hi> upon his Account;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0388100100:346"/>
but when Hate is fix'd in the Minds of ſome Men, 'tis never to be rooted out: Their Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities roſe as high as ever, and he was once more oblig'd to abandon the Iſland. There is now depending a Suit in Law between the Governour and Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who are both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and there is no doubt but Juſtice will take Place.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Larkins</hi> was put into the Dungeon of the Priſon, and it was the common Report, he was deny'd even Food to ſuſtain Life; and would have certainly expir'd for Want, if he had not made his Eſcape in the Habit of a Woman, with the Aſſiſtance of a true Friend; which is hard to find any where, but more eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Men of Power in <hi>America:</hi> But his Confinement had ſo worn him, and he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſo many Diſtempers by his Ill-Uſage, that he expir'd in his Voyage home.</p>
            <p>As I ſaid before, this Iſland was in former Times the common Receptacle for Pirates, and indeed their chiefeſt Gain proceeded from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with them. Here they came to ſpend what Money they got, and recreate themſelves; it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very convenient for 'em, between 32 and 33 Degrees of N. Latitude, and 300 Leagues from the Continent or any other Iſland.</p>
            <p>Among their Trees, the <hi>Cedar</hi> is the moſt plentiful, which they uſe even for Firing. I have ſeen Veſſels of a hundred Ton built with Cedar; and moſt of the Houſes are compos'd of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Laws <hi>ſhould</hi> be the ſame as thoſe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but Power is generally Chief Judge in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica:</hi> Yet if a Perſon never comes under the Laſh of the Superior, there is very comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Living at <hi>Bermuda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0388100100:347"/>
Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Capt. <hi>Bayley,</hi> and my ſelf, had joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought a Veſſel of about 140 Ton, and we had got in all our Freight but Tobacco, which we were to take in at <hi>Virginia,</hi> and then make up with the Fleet for <hi>England.</hi> While we were fitting out our Veſſel, Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was employ'd in his own Affairs, therefore the Care of his Share was committed to me.</p>
            <p>We ſet Sail from <hi>Bermuda, April</hi> 5, 1710, with a fair Gale, which continu'd till we loſt Sight of the Iſlands; but in the Night a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Wind ſprang up, and blowing very freſh at N. N. E. carry'd us to the Southward of the <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas;</hi> and it was the greateſt Providence in the World we were not ſtav'd upon the Rocks; but with great Difficulty we got clear of them, being oblig'd to ply it to Windward three Days.</p>
            <p>We had the Misfortune to find our Ship none of the beſt Sailors; yet in four Days we got in our proper Latitude; and the Wind conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing pretty fair, we made very good Way. We had no other Diverſion than taking Dolphins with our Fizgig; but in my Opinion it is but indifferent Food.</p>
            <p>We were forty one, including Paſſengers; and many of thoſe being ſick with the Rocking of the Ship, made it uncomfortable living among them; and I wiſh'd my ſelf once more on Shore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 12 we were alarm'd at Sight of a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel we diſcover'd, which we imagin'd to be a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Privateer. We crouded all the Sail we could to avoid her, which would have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to do, if immediately after the Wind had not chang'd to S. S. E. a very ſtrong Gale. We bore away before it, and ere Night loſt Sight of her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0388100100:348"/>
As we were at Supper in the Cabin, a Son of Capt. <hi>Bayley</hi>'s came and told his Father that the Colour of the Water was chang'd; but his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reprimanded him, and told him he had loſt his Senſes, for it was impoſſible to be near any Shore. When the Sea changes its Colour, 'tis an evident Token Land is not far off. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd the ſame Courſe under a Foreſail; but our Terror and Surprize was not to be expreſt, when in the Morning Watch, the Captain, who being upon Deck diſcover'd Land right a-head, came down into my Cabin, and with Tears in his Eyes deſir'd I would riſe. I knew by his Looks ſomething extraordinary was the Matter, and got upon Deck to be reſolv'd, for Capt. <hi>Bayley</hi> had not Power to utter a Word. I ſoon found the Danger, for I perceiv'd we were in View of <hi>Virginia,</hi> near <hi>Ronoke</hi> Sand-Banks. We did all that was in our Power to weather 'em, but our Ship having a round Head, ſhe would not obey the Helm; therefore we all agreed to make in for the Land, hoping, as it ſeem'd a bold Shore, it was Tide of Flood, and then we might through Providence land ſafe. But it proving Tide of Ebb, we bulg'd upon the <hi>Ronoke</hi> Sand-Banks, but by lightning the Ship, and cutting our Maſts by the Board, we got clear of that; but keeping ſtill in for the Shore, we ſtruck upon the ſecond Sand-Bank, but not very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, ſo we threw out our Anchors in hopes we might ride out the Tide; but the Wind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, we dragg'd 'em, and were violently thrown upon another Sand-Bank, where our Ship ſtuck, and the Waves daſh'd over us. We had ſeveral Women with Children on Board, and their diſmal Cries pierc'd my very Heart. We order'd the Boat out, to ſee if we could gain the Shore that way. I jump'd into her one of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0388100100:349"/>
the firſt, but ere we could leave the Side of the Ship, ſhe was ſtav'd in Pieces. All we could do in this Exigence was get into the Ship again; and with much difficulty we compaſs'd it, being dragg'd in by main Force; yet if I had not held faſt hold by the Coat of one that was in the Water with me, and the Foot of another, I muſt have ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably periſh'd, for I was under the Keel. When I had got Footing upon Deck, I fetch'd my Box out of my Cabin, and was for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Money, which amounted to Fifty Pound. While I was buſying my ſelf with uncording my Box, the Captain's Siſter reprimanded me for thinking on my Money, when all their Lives were in Danger. I muſt own, other Thoughts had been more ſuitable to my Condition, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was aſham'd of what I was about, and had no other Regard than to aſſiſt in ſaving our ſelves. It prov'd a fruitleſs Labour in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to get off the Veſſel, therefore we laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all Hopes of ſaving the Cargo.</p>
            <p>We had two Blacks on Board that belong'd to Capt. <hi>Bayley,</hi> that were excellent Divers (for the Surge was ſo violent no one could ſtem the Billows but by diving) who offer'd to get with a Rope on Shore, and faſten it from the Ship to a Stump of a Tree; and divine Providence had ſo order'd it, there was not any Thing like a Tree for half a Mile on each Side of us. I told the Captain it look'd like a good Omen, and, by the Help of God, I did not doubt but we ſhould get ſafe on Shore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Negroes</hi> with much Difficulty did as they had intended, and by the Help of the Rope came back to the Ship. Capt. <hi>Bayley,</hi> his Wife, and Mate, ventur'd into the Water firſt, upon the Awning of the Ship, and got ſafe on Shore; tho' it broke aſſoon as they were landed. But

my Ears are even pierc'd this Moment with the Cries of his poor Children that were in the Ship, which was more terrible to me than the Storm. I offer'd to help 'em upon the Rope, but they were in ſuch Frights and Terrors that I could not prevail upon 'em to venture.</p>
            <p>Two of the Sailors got upon the Rope juſt as I was going to venture, and with their Buſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling had very near thrown me once more into the Sea. I offer'd my Aſſiſtance to the Capain's Siſter, but ſhe was as timorous as the Children, and fed her ſelf with vain Hopes that the Waves would leave 'em by degrees, and they might with leſs Danger get on Shore. I took my Leave of all that were on Board, and recommending them and my ſelf to the Care of Heaven, I got into the Water and laid faſt hold on the Rope, and, with the Aſſiſtance of one of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> got ſome Diſtance from the Ship; but the Waves drove back with ſuch an Impetuoſity that I was many times in Danger of loſing my Hold, and ſo be carried into the main Sea; which had certainly came to paſs, if I had not been aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Black; for every time a great Sea was coming to break over us, he would cry out, <hi>For the Lord's Sake, Maſter, hold faſt:</hi> And whenever he call'd to me, I ſettled my ſelf to receive the Force of the Waves, which would as oft over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm me; and I poured out my Prayers to God for his Aſſiſtance. At laſt, with much Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, I could feel my Feet touch the Ground ſometimes, and by degrees, with the utmoſt Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, got Footing; and at every Retire of the Waves ſet my ſelf to running. When they drove back upon the Shore, I ſeiz'd upon the Rope, or otherwiſe I had been daſh'd to pieces on the Sand. But at laſt my Strength began to fail me, with the violent Fatigue I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0388100100:351"/>
and if the <hi>Negro</hi> had not dragg'd me on the Sands, (whoſe Strength alſo was almoſt gone) I muſt, after all my Strugglings for Life, have reſign'd my ſelf to the Waves.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as I could recover my Spirits, I gave the divine Creator of all things, Thanks for my wonderful Delivery from the Jaws of Death; which was ſtill more wonderful, for aſſoon as I had let go the Rope (ſome other Perſons venturing the ſame way) it broke, ſo that not one of the unfortunate Wretches came on Shore, but were ſwallow'd up by the Waves.</p>
            <p>A-while after I had got on Shore, Captain <hi>Bayley,</hi> his Wife, and the Mate came down to me, and inform'd me that they could find no Road, nor any Inhabitants. This News re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd our Griefs, for we ſeem'd to be in as much Danger of Starving now, as of Drowning before: And to increaſe our Dread, it was not above three Hours to Night, and then we had the wild Bears to fear.</p>
            <p>While we were lamenting our Condition, we heard ſomebody hollow up in the Woods, which reviv'd our drooping Senſes: But running to ſee who it was, we, much to our Grief, found it to be one of the Sailors that eſcap'd, who was hollowing to his Companion; and they were both as drunk as 'twas poſſible for them to be, with Rum, before they left the Ship. Such Beaſts are ſome Sailors, that even the greateſt Dangers will not deter them from Drinking, if they have an Opportunity.</p>
            <p>When we were all together, (that is, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, his Wife, and Mate, two white Sailors, two <hi>Negroes,</hi> and my ſelf,) we reſolv'd to walk to the Southward, to ſee if it were poſſible to find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Habitations; but in leſs than an Hour, our
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0388100100:352"/>
Journey was ſtopp'd by an impenetrable Wood, and we were obliged to return.</p>
            <p>We then went Northward, but were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by large Swamps, and not the leaſt Mark of any Plantation. Thus, maroon'd as we were, we went back again, and could perceive the poor Wretches in the Veſſel, lifting up their Hands to us for Succour; but we could neither give 'em Aſſiſtance or Comfort. I made 'em Signs to let 'em know our Condition was as bad as theirs, and that they had nothing to think on but Heaven.</p>
            <p>It growing near Night, ſome of the poor Creatures ventur'd into the Water, but were ſoon drown'd. In ſhort, every Object we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held increas'd our Horror. None of us had eat or drank for two Days, beſides our Fatigue. Tho' quite caſt down my ſelf, I endeavour'd to chear my Fellow-Sufferers; and that we might be ſhelter'd from the Inclemency of the Night (which, to add to our wretched Condition, prov'd a rainy one) we by joint Conſent and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, while the Day laſted, pluck'd down a good Number of <hi>Palmetoe</hi> Leaves; and with Pieces of Trees (which we tore, for we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Knife among us) built us up a Hut, and ſhelter'd it from the Weather as well as we could.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Palmetoe</hi> Leaf is very large, and the ſame that they make the plaited Straw of, which forms the fineſt Hats, that come from <hi>Bermuda</hi> and <hi>Carolina.</hi> It was a very melancholy Reflection to think of our Condition: Nothing to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but the bare wet Ground, and our Cloaths that cover'd us were thoſe upon our Backs, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with Rain and Salt-Water; no Food, nor Hopes of getting any; and I was even ready to expire with Thirſt. While the Hut was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0388100100:353"/>
to allay my Drouth, I ſtole by my ſelf, urin'd in my Tobacco-Box, and drank it with as great a Guſto as ever I have done <hi>French</hi> Claret before or ſince.</p>
            <p>When I came to lie down in our wretched Tenement, the Place was full; but I e'en laid my ſelf down upon 'em, (and tho' a Woman was among us, had no Thoughts of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sexes) and by degrees made Room for my ſelf. Notwithſtanding their complaining of Legs and Arms, I held my Tongue, and, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all my Wants and Misfortunes, ſlept ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till Morning: But with the Day Reflection return'd, ſharpen'd with the extreameſt Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>When we had got all together again, (that is, ſeven of us, for one of the drunken Sailors was found dead ſome Diſtance from our Cabin, as we might well imagine, with Cold and Want, and ſpoil'd an excellent Proverb, <hi>That drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Men never get any Harm)</hi> by my Advice we addreſs'd our ſelves to the All-ſeeing Power for Succour; all but the Mate, who told us that Praying alone would not do, therefore while we <hi>pray'd,</hi> he would go <hi>ſeek.</hi> After our extempore Oriſons were over, we roſe up, and reſolv'd to go into the Woods, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it was poſſible, ſomething to kill our Hunger. But as we turn'd toward the Beach, we ſaw the Mate with another Man, a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to us, coming towards us. The Dove could not be a more pleaſing Sight to the Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> when he return'd with the Olive-Branch in his Mouth, than that Stranger was to us. We ran with all the Speed which our weak Condition would admit of, to meet him. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Arm he had got a little Tub of Butter that the Sea had thrown up; and though mixt
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0388100100:354"/>
with Sand and Gravel, we as greedily devour'd it as if it had been Partridge or Pheaſant; but our Misfortune was, when we had tir'd our ſelves with Eating, for I can't ſay we were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd, we all of us grew Sick, and caſt it up again.</p>
            <p>The Stranger, to relieve us, gave us a Couple of Limes among us, which we greedily devour'd, and to the Butter again. But what was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Surprize to us, our Mate inform'd us a Puncheon of freſh Water was thrown on Shore. We eagerly ran, and my Tobacco-Box ſerv'd us inſtead of a Cup. The Mate, who had ſlak'd his Thirſt before, would not let us drink too much, for fear of endangering our Lives; but with this indifferent Repaſt we recover'd our fainting Spirits, and were more able to bear the Fatigue of the Day.</p>
            <p>Our Veſſel was drove cloſe on Shore, but broke in many Pieces; and it was a melancholy Sight to behold the dead Bodies covering the Sand: But what had almoſt kill'd Capt. <hi>Bayley</hi> and his Wife with Sorrow, were the Bodies of his Siſter and one of his Children half buried in the Sands. For my own part, I had no other thing to grieve for but the Loſs of my Cargo, which conſiſted of <hi>Cotton, Indigo,</hi> and Straw Ware; which, if it had arriv'd ſafe to <hi>England,</hi> would have yielded to my own Share fifteen hundred Pound: Tho' the Loſs of my <hi>Harpſichord</hi> and <hi>Italian Timbrel</hi> I moſt regretted, whoſe Remains I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd upon the Shore; and the whole Strand was cover'd with <hi>Bermuda</hi> Hats. Some we pick'd up; and among other pieces of the Wreck, the Mate diſcover'd my Box floating on the Surface, which by good Fortune he dragg'd on Shore. In it was my Money, Linnen, and Books of Accounts. We kept this private from the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0388100100:355"/>
Stranger, and bury'd it in a Place I had mark'd by ſeveral Obſervations: For he had given us to underſtand, it was his uſual Cuſtom, after a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storm, to come to the Sand-Banks in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Shipwrecks; therefore we were not aſſur'd he might not find Means to deſtroy us in Hopes of what we had on Shore, or leave us without aſſiſting us to ſome Plantation.</p>
            <p>When we had done all we could about our Wreck, we took leave of the miſerable Sight, and ſet forward to the Stranger's Plantation, which was about ten Miles off. He led us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Woods by certain Marks on Trees, which we were ignorant of; but the Inhabitants know how to find one another's Plantations by thoſe Marks; and in four Hours (for I had my Watch in my Pocket when I was ſhipwreck'd) we once more beheld the pleaſing Sight of a Chimney ſmoaking, which was the Habitation of our Guide. You may imagine the Joy we had to enter once more into a Houſe, after our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hardſhips. But when we came there, we found but indifferent Accommodation. There were no other Eatables to be got, but a little hung Beef, and <hi>Humminy,</hi> (that is, <hi>Indian</hi> Corn ground, mix'd with Milk, and dry'd before the Fire:) but this was Feaſting to us; for Hunger is the beſt Sauce.</p>
            <p>There were but two Beds in the Houſe, which the Family complimented us with. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and his Wife had one, and Mr. <hi>Burnam</hi> and I had the other.</p>
            <p>I deferr'd going for my Box till the ſecond Day after our Arrival; for I was very much out of Order with the Fatigue I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went; and by lying on the wet Ground I had loſt my Hearing, which I did not recover through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till my Arrival in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0388100100:356"/>
The Mate, 'two <hi>Negroes,</hi> and my ſelf, ſet out with one to guide us to the Place of our Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck; but we were ſo long in looking for my Box, that we were ready to give over all Search: But juſt as we were thinking of returning, the Mate happily found it out.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Negroes</hi> took it by Turns, and we brought it ſafe to the Plantation.</p>
            <p>I had a good Parcel of Linnen in it, which I lent to my Fellow-Sufferers: But it was an odd Sight to diſcover ſo many Scare-crows, with tatter'd Coats and fine ruffled Shirts on.</p>
            <p>Our Hoſt was very well ſatisfy'd for our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment with what he found of the Wreck.</p>
            <p>We ſtaid here five Days to refreſh our ſelves, and then reſolv'd to go up the River to wait on Colonel <hi>Carew,</hi> Deputy-Governor of <hi>North-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina;</hi> a Gentleman I had the Honour of being acquainted with. We hir'd a Canoo with two Sails, and embark'd, Capt. <hi>Baily,</hi> his Wife, the Mate, two Blacks and the Sailor, with another from the Plantation to aſſiſt us. We ſail'd up <hi>Ronoke</hi> Sound with a freſh Gale, and at ſeven a-clock the next Morning ſtopp'd at Colonel <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew</hi>'s Plantation, who out of his known Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy entertained us very handſomely. We took our leaves, and at eight a-clock the ſame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came before the Governour's Houſe, ſituate on the River <hi>Notaway,</hi> which runs into the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noke</hi> about fifty Leagues from the Sea.</p>
            <p>I ſent up one of the Men to acquaint the Governour I was come to wait on him; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inſtant he came down to the Shore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by Capt. <hi>Cratbach,</hi> a Native of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muda</hi> Iſland, and one I had long been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with. He had left <hi>Bermuda</hi> ſince we came away, and the Governour and he had juſt been wiſhing I had eſcap'd the Storm as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger came to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0388100100:357"/>
Aſſoon as ever he ſaw me, he cry'd out, I am ſorry for your Misfortune, I can eaſily perceive an ill Wind drove you hither. He would not ſuffer us to talk much, but hurry'd the whole Company into his Dining-Room, where ſtood a Supper and a Bowl of Punch, with ſeveral Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen his Gueſts. He begg'd their Pardon, but told 'em they ſhould neither eat nor drink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had ſatisfy'd our ſelves; and we ſoon clear'd what was put before us: and then another Supper was provided for the whole Company, which we had our Shares of, notwithſtanding what we had eaten before.</p>
            <p>The Governour was but ill provided with Beds, therefore Capt. <hi>Bayley</hi> and his Wife went to Mr. <hi>Glover</hi>'s, a neighbouring Gentleman; and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary would have me home with him, about a Mile from the Governour's. When we came to his Houſe, we found a Quarter of a <hi>Shote</hi> (a young Hog) and a Turkey on the Table. I ſat down once more, and made a hearty Supper; and I muſt own, I never thought I ſhould bring my Stomach to its proper Tone again. After we had drank very heartily, we went to Bed. The next Morning we breakfaſted upon broil'd Fowls and Chocolate. (<hi>My Readers, if any, I hope will not ridicule my taking Notice ſo often of Eating, till<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they put themſelves in my ſtarv'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Day we went to dine with a Friend of the Secretary's; and as we were at Dinner, a Meſſenger came from the Governour and Capt. <hi>Bayley,</hi> to inform me a Veſſel was going that Inſtant for <hi>Kakatan,</hi> (a Harbour where the <hi>Virginia</hi> Fleet make up, and with the Convoy ſet ſail all together for <hi>England)</hi> and that Capt. <hi>Bayley</hi> and the reſt of my unfortunate Company waited on Board for me. Notwithſtanding my Stomach,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0388100100:358"/>
I was oblig'd to make all the Diſpatch I could to the Place where the Veſſel lay; but to my great Misfortune, the Wind proving fair for them, they were oblig'd to take the Advantage; and when I arriv'd at the Port they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of Sight. I was very much concern'd at this Loſs of my Paſſage, for it was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable I might not get ſuch another Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity till the Fleet was gone, and then I ſhould be oblig'd to ſtay till next Year.</p>
            <p>The Governour ſeeing me ſo much concern'd, offer'd me his Horſe to go to <hi>Kakatan</hi> by Land, about 120 Leagues from the Place where we were; and he procured me a Guide, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Quaker,</hi> who for ten Pieces of Eight agreed to accompany me, and bring the Governour's Horſe back again.</p>
            <p>We ſet out immediately; for I had no Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to carry: becauſe Capt. <hi>Bayley,</hi> as imagining I would come time enough, had got all my Things on Board.</p>
            <p>We rode that Day about twenty Mile, thro' unfrequented Woods; but my Guide knew the Way by the above-mention'd Marks upon Trees. We came to a Quaker's Plantation; and all the Compliments my Guide us'd to him was only this, <hi>Friend, I have brought along with me a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck'd Gentleman, who is going to</hi> Kakatan, <hi>and deſires a Lodging to-night;</hi> who was anſwer'd by our new Hoſt, <hi>Friend, come in; thou art welcome.</hi> And indeed he made his Words good, for we had plenty of every thing, and a handſome Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lie in, the beſt in the Houſe. I was very much pleas'd with his Converſation, for I found him a Man of a ſound Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>In the Morning when I was going, I offer'd to pay him for what I had; but he ſeem'd much offended at my Propoſition. Said he, <hi>My Houſe</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0388100100:359"/>
               <hi>is no Inn, and we ſee Strangers ſo very ſeldom, that they are always welcome when they come; and God forbid that I ſhould leſſen the Store of an unfortunate Man, like thy ſelf.</hi> In ſhort, this is the Treatment I met with in my ſix Days Travel. Hoſpitality is commendable in all Countries, and <hi>England</hi> was once famous for it, but it ſeems at preſent baniſh'd to <hi>America.</hi> The third Day my Horſe tumbled with me into a deep Swamp, and I was not only in danger of drowning, but of having my Brains daſh'd out with his Hoofs in his Floundering. I continu'd ſo long in this Condition, that I gave my ſelf up for loſt; for my Guide could not come to aſſiſt me, without being in the ſame Danger. At laſt, my Horſe, with much ſtruggling, got Foot on firm Ground; by good Fortune I had got hold of the Stirrup, and he drew me up with him, to the great Joy of my Guide, who gave me for gone.</p>
            <p>You muſt imagine I was not very eaſy in the reſt of my Day's Journey, which I was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to ride all cover'd with Water and Mud. But our Hoſt, where we lay at Night, got all my Things clean and dry by the time I roſe in the Morning.</p>
            <p>Our firſt four Days we travell'd through vaſt Woods, without ſeeing any humane Creature, but at the Plantations where we din'd and ſupp'd; and our Stages were very different, ſometimes more than twenty Mile aſunder, and at other times not above ſeven. Monſtrous Snakes I ſaw of different Kinds, but none attempted to come near us till the fifth Day; when, as we were riding along, my Horſe gave a Start, and ran on with me five hundred Yards before I could ſtop him. I turn'd about, and ſaw a <hi>Rattle-Snake,</hi> of a monſtrous Bulk, ſpring at my Guide, who happen'd at that time to be behind me;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0388100100:360"/>
and it was very well he was, for if I had been in his Place, I ſhould certainly have met with Death, in not knowing how to avoid it.</p>
            <p>Their manner of ſpringing upon any thing is this; they fold themſelves up in Rings, then clap their Tail to the Ground, and dart upon their Prey: But as they are ſome time in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, a Perſon may avoid 'em, who knows their Manner.</p>
            <p>There is but one Way to cure the Bite of theſe venomous Creatures, and that is to apply immediately the Fundament of a Fowl to the Wound, and keep it there till it be dead; which does not always happen. If the Fowl dies, there is Hope of a Cure; but if it does not, all the Phyſicians in the World can't help you. My Guide told me, this was one of the largeſt he had ever ſeen. I believe it was near ſix Yards in Length, and as thick as a luſty Man's Thigh. It is very rare for 'em to come ſo near the Roads, but this being little frequented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was the Reaſon of it. The Rattle, which is in their Tail, makes an odd Sort of a Noiſe. When I was at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> a Gentleman ſhow'd me the Rattle. It was about a Yard and a half long, in ſmall Joints, cover'd with a thin tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Skin, like your white Gold-beater's Skin. They ſay they have a Joint grows every Year; but I can't tell who can prove it. The Rattle, as it lay folded in my Hand, ſeem'd ſo light that if I had not ſeen it there I could not have perceiv'd it by the Weight.</p>
            <p>The laſt Day's Journey was one of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt I had ever travell'd in my Life, in a fine ſweet Road, ſhaded by Trees for many Miles together, and through 'em on each ſide, nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Plantations, with a well cultivated Glebe.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0388100100:361"/>
The whole Proſpect put me in Mind of the Vale of <hi>Eveſham</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixth Night I lay at the Father's of my Guide, having one Day's Journey more to reach <hi>Kakatan.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> the Name of my Guide's Father, was Owner of a handſome Plantation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>James</hi> River; and there were ſo many about it that it look'd like a little Town.</p>
            <p>The next Day after my Arrival, being <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> there was a general Aſſembly of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and moſt of the Elders din'd with Mr. <hi>Ratcliff.</hi> When Dinner was ſerv'd, they began in their uſual manner with their long Graces, and when one had made an end, another roſe up to begin; but Mr. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> begg'd, upon my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that they would for once abridge the Motion of the Spirit, and let it take its full Scope for an After-Grace.</p>
            <p>We had Notice from <hi>Kakatan,</hi> that the Fleet would not ſail for ſome time; ſo I ſtaid with my friendly Quaker four Days, who treated me very generouſly. I call'd for his Son to diſmiſs him back to the Governor, with the Horſes: As I was paying him the Money I agreed for, his Father coming in by Accident, was very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him, and declared he would diſown him for his Child if he took a Penny. I was not at all pleas'd with the Refuſal, for the poor Man had taken a great deal of Pains with me; wherefore meeting by Chance with four Yards of Muſlin to be ſold, I bought it, and made him a Preſent of it unknown to his Father; tho' I had ſome Difficulty to make him accept of it, after what his Father had ſaid to him.</p>
            <p>The fourth Day after my Arrival, we had No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the Fleet would ſail in a few Days. This gave me a great deal of Uneaſineſs; for I could not get to <hi>Kakatan</hi> without a Boat, and Mr.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0388100100:362"/>
               <hi>Ratcliff</hi>'s was broke to Pieces ſome time before I came there. But he ſeeing the Uneaſineſs I labour'd under, procur'd one: Yet another Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty aroſe, we could not gain, even for Money, any Body to row us. Well, ſaid Mr. <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> ſince we have got a Boat, thou ſhalt not be made uneaſie for want of People to work it, I and my Children will go along with thee. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we ſet out, and arrived at <hi>Kakatan:</hi> But we were ſurpriz'd not to find above five Sail there, and one of 'em that Veſſel that Capt. <hi>Bayley</hi> went in; ſo I had the Satisfaction of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Things again.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the Fleet's not being there, the Place was ſo full of People in Expectation of it, that there was no Lodging to be had. I was not ſo much concern'd for my ſelf as for my generous Quaker, who was to meet with ſuch bad Accommodation for his good Nature in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying me.</p>
            <p>I met with a Gentleman bound for <hi>England,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Le Cruce,</hi> at preſent a Wine-Merchant in St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Lane, who ſeeing the Shifts we were put to, offer'd me half his Bed, which I accepted of for my Friendly Quaker, but I could not prevail upon him to take it: therefore I lay with Mr. <hi>Le Cruce</hi> my ſelf, and Mr. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> with his Sons made what Shift they could upon the Ground.</p>
            <p>It was the Report of every one, that the Fleet would not get together in four Months, ſo I reſolved to take a Trip to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in the mean time.</p>
            <p>I did not know how to faſten a Preſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> for his Civility, for he would not hear of any thing like it; but at laſt I found out this Method. I bought a Runlet of Rum, a Thing very much in Eſteem among the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0388100100:363"/>
and I begg'd Mr. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> to add to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations I had already received from him, by taking Charge of it and a Letter to one Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> a Planter in his Neighbourhood. In the Letter I ſent to Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> was one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd for Mr. <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where I inform'd him the Rum was to him, only as a ſmall Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for the many Obligations he had laid me under.</p>
            <p>The next Day he and his Sons took their leave of me, even without taking any thing for the Hire of the Boat, tho' I had bargain'd for it before I left the Place.</p>
            <p>The Veſſel that was to carry me to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was not clear'd of her Lading, therefore I was oblig'd to ſtay ſeven Days at <hi>Kakatan,</hi> which is no Place of Reſort but only once a Year, at the Time the Fleet makes up for <hi>England;</hi> ſo there are not many Conveniences expected there.</p>
            <p>The Day before I fail'd for <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Letter from my Friendly Quaker, with a Preſent of a powder'd <hi>Shote</hi> and ſeveral Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, which he ſent me by Water.</p>
            <p>The Letter was as follows.</p>

            <p>The Veſſel had but one Cabin in it, which was taken up by a Woman-Paſſenger; ſo that I was oblig'd to make ſhift to warp my ſelf up in the Sail; and the Spray of the Waves beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0388100100:364"/>
over us now and then, I had but a wet Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and tho' it was nothing to what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went before, yet I got more Cold by it. We made ſo good Way that we got up to <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Delaware</hi> River the ſecond Evening; and we prevail'd upon the Maſter to ſtay there all Night, where I got a good Lodging at a publick Houſe, being the firſt time I had paid for any thing ſince my Shipwreck.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> the Capital of the County of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> is a handſome well-built Town, ſtanding upon an Eminence, which gives you a pleaſant View from the River <hi>Delaware.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> were the firſt Founders, but did not poſſeſs it long. There are now above 500 handſome Houſes, and Foundations for ſeveral more. As it is daily increaſing in Wealth by Trade, we may imagine it will increaſe in Buildings and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. I have been inform'd they have diſcover'd in the Neighbourhood of this Town a fine Iron Mine.</p>
            <p>The Day following we din'd at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle neat Town on the ſame River, conſiſting of near three hundred Houſes. We were very handſomely entertain'd there by a Gentleman of the Place, who would accompany us to <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.</hi> We had a pleaſant Voyage, with many delightful Proſpects of Towns, Villages, and Plantations, on both ſides of the River; and in the Evening we landed at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Penſylvania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penſylvania</hi> takes its Name from <hi>William Penn,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Son to Sir <hi>William Penn,</hi> Admiral of a Squadron in the <hi>Dutch</hi> War, where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd like a Man of Courage and Conduct. His Son, the preſent Proprietor, met with ſome Difficulty in obtaining his Patent, by reaſon he
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0388100100:365"/>
had declar'd himſelf Head of the People call'd <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penſylvania</hi> is compos'd of all that Tract of Land, with its Iſlands, Rivers, Coaſts, and Bays, which lies from forty to forty-five Degrees of North Latitude, and is one of the richeſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in his Majeſty's foreign Dominions.</p>
            <p>The Air is pleaſant, wholeſome, and uncloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or very rarely overcaſt. Tho' the Winter is ſomething colder, and the Summer hotter than in <hi>England,</hi> yet the Inhabitants have known ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Winters together without Froſts. The Day in the Summer is two Hours ſhorter than ours, and in Winter two Hours longer; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally better for Buſineſs of all kinds. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is a Tract of Ground as well ſeated as any in the World, for Pleaſure and Profit. It is bounded on the Eaſt by <hi>Weſt-Jerſey,</hi> on the Weſt by <hi>Virginia, Canada</hi> on the North, and <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on the South; all, except <hi>Canada,</hi> fine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlements.</p>
            <p>The original Inhabitants of all theſe Places are ſuppos'd to be the ten Tribes of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were ſcatter'd; but from whence they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Authority, even for this Suppoſition, I can't imagine. 'Tis true, ſome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtoms are among the <hi>Indians;</hi> but as every Nation and People have Cuſtoms peculiar to themſelves, in my Opinion there is nothing to be gather'd from thence. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they have ſomething of the Countenance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they obſerve New Moons, and offer their Firſt-Fruits to their Idols. They are moſt of 'em well made, and exactly proportion'd in their Features, without the thick Lips and flat Noſes of the <hi>Negroes.</hi> They are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good natur'd and inoffenſive, ſlow to Anger, but hard to be appeas'd; a courteous
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0388100100:366"/>
and humane Behaviour will gain upon 'em more than Severity: It is very ſeldom they wrong a good Maſter, but I have known 'em frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venture their Lives for 'em. Their Language is very lofty and high ſounding, but not copious, for one Word hath ſeveral Meanings. I'll give you, from my Friend Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> a ſhort Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen.</p>
            <p>Hodi hita nee huska apeechi, nee machi <hi>Penſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> huska dogwachi keſhow apeechi nowa, huska hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chetena koon peo.</p>
            <p>Thus in <hi>Engliſh:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farewell, my Friend. I ſhall go ſhortly to <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi> We ſhall have a cold Moon preſently, and hard Froſts will ſoon follow.</p>
            <p>They throw their Children into the Water aſſoon as born, to harden their Bodies. The Buſineſs of the Men is to fiſh or hunt, and the Women to Till their Ground, and look after their Children, who commonly go alone at nine Months. They are moſt of them knowing in Botany; and if at any time viſited with Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cure themſelves by their Knowledge in Herbs and Roots. They are exceeding charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and if any among 'em have the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be lame or blind, they take care they ſhall want for nothing. The Boys go a hunting or fiſhing with the Father at ſix Years old; and when they are experienced in both, and arrive to their ſixteenth Year, they may marry. The Girls ſtay at home with their Mother, who inſtructs them in her Buſineſs. The Women are very modeſt and chaſte, and you can't affront them more than by ſaying any thing to the contrary of either. Adultery is puniſh'd with Death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0388100100:367"/>
Their Habitations are generally mean and ſmall, and their Utenſils a Pot, and two or three Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhes, with a Bowl; and when they travel, they lie in the Woods about a Fire, to keep the wild Beaſts from them. They are People of a merry Diſpoſition, continually laughing and ſinging, even at their Work. They have ſome particular Songs among 'em, though but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Tunes, and their Inſtruments of Muſick are as poor. They are generally given to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety; but if they once get Liquor of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans,</hi> they never give over till dead drunk; and I have ſeen 'em lye in the middle of the Roads and Streets, like ſo many Dogs. Aſſoon as ever they come to themſelves, they plunge into the Water, and gather ſome Herbs, ſqueeze 'em into a Calabaſh, which they drink; by which Means they are recover'd, and are never ſick after their Debauches. Their Age generally comes up to ſeventy, and very few to eighty. I have heard one <hi>Indian</hi> ſpeaking to another, when on his Death-Bed, of the Uncertainty of this Life, and how happy he ſhould be in the Company of their God, where would be no want of Corn, or Wood, or any Thing that was needful for him. But there is a great Number inſtructed in the Chriſtian Faith. There are <hi>Indian</hi> Schools to teach 'em Writing as well as Reading; and moſt of 'em are very docile.</p>
            <p>The Country of <hi>Penſylvania</hi> abounds with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing neceſſary for the Life of Man, even for the moſt luxurious.</p>
            <p>The Woods afford fine Pidgeons, Pheaſants, Quails, Partridges, Woodcocks, Snipes, wild Turkies, and various other Birds. About the Rivers, Geeſe, Ducks, Swans, Teal, Divers, Brands, &amp;c. In the Rivers (generally a gravelly Bottom) are to be found Herrings, Smelts,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0388100100:368"/>
Roach, Dace, Eels, Perch, Salmon, Trout, Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Shadds, Cats-heads, Sheeps-heads, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more; with fine large Oyſters, preferable to any I ever taſted in <hi>England;</hi> and when any of theſe are brought to Market, you may buy 'em very reaſonably.</p>
            <p>The Wood produce Cedar, Mulberry, Vines, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> were the firſt Foreigners that came to theſe Parts; but they made but few Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; their chief Buſineſs was to trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> for Skins, Furrs, &amp;c. and give them in Exchange, Rum, Beer, and Sugar. The next that appear'd was a Colony from <hi>Sweden,</hi> who began to plant and manure the Ground. The <hi>Dutch</hi> were offended at theſe Interlopers, as they call'd 'em, and threaten'd to make War upon 'em; which was prevented by the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring the Plantations to 'em, who return'd home.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Dutch</hi> War, Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> made a Deſcent upon 'em, outed 'em quite, and took Poſſeſſion of it for the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1666, and left a Relation of his, of the ſame Name, as Governour; but the next Year the <hi>Dutch</hi> got the Maſtery again; and the few <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were there, ſettled themſelves in the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, better provided with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt an Invader.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> remain'd Poſſeſſors of this pleaſant Country till the Peace was concluded between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and then it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd once again to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but no great Progreſs was made there till 1682, the Year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0388100100:369"/>
Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> had gain'd the Patent for it. In leſs than a Year there were a hundred Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes built, and form'd into a Town, to which Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> gave the Name of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> (or Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love.) A Place for its Situation very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſeated high upon a Neck of Land, form'd by two fine navigable Rivers, two hundred Miles from the Sea; yet Ships of five hundred Ton can unlade on the Key.</p>
            <p>The Country about it is rich, well water'd and wooded; the Earth producing a vaſt Increaſe. They reap their Corn about the Beginning of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gardens and Orchards yield all Roots, Fruits and Flowers we have in <hi>England,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral peculiar only to the Country. The Air is ſo healthy that there is no Occaſion for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, being they find Cures for their acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſeaſes by Simples; and the People ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, there's no want of a Lawyer among them; and if any Difference happens, a third Perſon makes up the Matter, without the Charge of a Law-Suit. This Country is divided into ſix Counties or Diviſions, and each County ſends ſix Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the Aſſembly at <hi>Philadelphia. Cheſter</hi> 6; <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> 6; <hi>Kent</hi> 6; <hi>Bucks</hi> 6; <hi>Suſſex</hi> 6; and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> 6. All theſe mention'd Places have Yearly Fairs, and Weekly Markets, being very conveniently ſituated for Commerce with the Country about 'em.</p>
            <p>They have excellent Copper Mines, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce better Copper than any in <hi>England,</hi> both for Colour and Fineſs. Coal Mines have been lately found; and ſeveral mineral Waters that perform the ſame Office as <hi>Bath, Tunbridge,</hi> or <hi>Epſom.</hi> There is alſo found good Stone for Building, that proves hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and laſting, and another thin Stone which they Tile their Houſes with, being much neater than our
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0388100100:370"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tile. Alſo Loadſtones, and the <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> Stone, having a Subſtance like Cotton in the Veins, which will not conſume in the Fire.</p>
            <p>The Woods produce Wolves, Panthers, Bears, Deer, Hares, Antelopes, Foxes, Rackoons, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, Squirrels, Bevers, &amp;c. whoſe Skins yield great Profit to the Taker; and a Creature call'd a <hi>Poſſum,</hi> that has a falſe Belly into which the young ones retire in time of Danger: Alſo the Flying-Squirrel, with Wings like thoſe of a Bat; and I have often ſeen it fly from Tree to Tree.</p>
            <p>Red Deer, Buffalos, and <hi>Elks</hi> are common in the Woods, and delicious Food; but they are generally purchas'd from the <hi>Indians,</hi> (tho' at a very reaſonable Rate) they being the People that beſt know how to hunt them. There is a Reward given 'em for killing a Bear or Wolf, which has very much leſſen'd the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of both; though any Perſon has the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to hunt, fiſh, or fowl, without being moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There's alſo Plenty of Otters about the Rivers, and ſuch a multitude of Frogs in the <hi>Swamps</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">A <hi>Swamp</hi> is much of the ſame kind as the <hi>Boggs</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> that they diſturb you with their Croaking; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Bull-Frog,</hi> that makes a Noiſe ſomething like that Beaſt, and is the Baſe to all the others.</p>
            <p>If the diſtreſs'd People of <hi>England</hi> knew the Comforts of <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> and the caſy Means there is of a Livelihood, they would never ſtay where they are, in a continual Scene of Want and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Even the meaneſt Servant has better Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than thoſe in <hi>England.</hi> If criminal Perſons were ſent over there, they would find Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet be reſtrain'd in the Vices for which they were puniſh'd: For a Thief there is to return Four-fold what he has ſtole; and if he has not wherewithal to do that, he's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to work it out. But every thing is in
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0388100100:371"/>
ſuch Plenty there, they would have no Occaſion to exerciſe their Talents that Way.</p>
            <p>Their Beef, Mutton, Pork, Lamb, Veal, &amp;c. is equal to our Meat in <hi>England,</hi> with which they trade to the <hi>Leeward-Iſlands,</hi> and bring in Return, Rum, Sugar, Moloſſos, and Pieces of Eight. Their Horſes are ſtrong, handſome, and hardy, and ſeldom feed on any thing but Graſs; and after the hardeſt Day's Work, are turn'd out hot into the Fields, yet get no Harm.</p>
            <p>The Country produces great Numbers of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Pear Trees, with which they make great Quantities of Cyder and Perry, that is very wholeſome and well taſted.</p>
            <p>There are many large, beautiful, well-built Towns in the Province of <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> of which, as I ſaid before, <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is the chief. It is a noble, large, and populous City, ſtanding on as much Ground as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſeated upon a Neck of Land form'd by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Delaware</hi> and the <hi>Schuylkill,</hi> both navigable many Leagues above the City. It is built ſquare in Form of a Cheſs-Board, with each Front fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one of the Rivers.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Streets near two Mile long, as wide as <hi>Holborn,</hi> and better built, after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manner. The chief are <hi>Broad-ſtreet, King-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> tho' there are ſeveral other handſome Streets that take their Names from the Productions of the Country; as <hi>Mulberry, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, Beech, Saſſafras, Cedar, Vine, Aſh,</hi> and <hi>Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut Streets.</hi> From theſe Streets run great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Courts, Yards, and Allies, with well-built Houſes in 'em. There are ſeveral Coves and Docks where large Ships are built; and by a moderate Computation, there has been launch'd from the Stocks of this City in forty Year, near 300 Sail of Ships, beſides Small-Craft, which may in ſome ſort
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0388100100:372"/>
give us an Idea of the Opulency of the Place. Many of their Merchants keep their Coaches, and the Tradeſmens Shops and Streets are well frequented. All Religions are tolerated here, which is one Means to increaſe the Riches of the Place. The People of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſh'd, have a neat, well-built Church, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Year 1695, and I am inform'd the Foundation is laid for another. The <hi>Quakers</hi> (who are the major Part of the Inhabitants) have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meetings. There is a <hi>Swediſh</hi> reform'd Church, Mr. <hi>Rudman</hi> the Incumbent, a Man of ſingular Learning and Piety; who is as much follow'd by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> when he preaches, as the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> I ſhall beg leave to give one Inſtance of his Humility and Piety. When Subſcriptions were taking in to build the Church, he ſubſcrib'd a conſiderable Sum; but when call'd upon for the Money, he had it not in his Power to pay it; yet to keep his Word, he contracted with the Maſter-Builder for ſo much a-day, to carry the Hod, till he had work'd his Subſcription-Money out. This was an Inſtance of his Piety and Zeal for Religion; and I fancy if Churches were to be built after the ſame Manner in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Iſland, the Work would go but ſlowly on. There are ſingle Houſes upon the Key that have coſt 6000 <hi>l.</hi> the Building. Mr. <hi>Badcock</hi>'s Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe is a noble, large Building, and has in it one ſingle Veſſel that will hold eight Ton of Liquor.</p>
            <p>In this City is held the Courts of the Province, and the Aſſembly meet here, which is in the nature of a dependant Parliament, as in thoſe Cities of <hi>France</hi> that are diſtant from the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. There are three Fairs in the Year, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Week two Markets. In time of the Fairs the City is ſo throng'd, as well as the adjacent Plantations, that it is hard to find a Lodging.</p>

The Government and Conſtitutions are the ſame as in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Council is compos'd of the Proteſtants and Quakers, but the Publick Officers are taken out of the former. The Governour is nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the reſt of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Officers are, Maſter of the Rolls, four Judges, a Judge of the Admiralty, Secretary, Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General, Treaſurer, Publick Regiſter, Clerk of the Peace, as alſo a Commiſſary, and a Survey-or-General. Theſe, with eight Members of the Council, form the Government of the City. The Number of the Inhabitants is generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be upwards of 15000, beſides Slaves. There is hardly any Trade in <hi>England</hi> but the ſame may be met with in <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> and every Mechanick has better Wages; a Journeyman Taylor has twelve Shillings a Week, beſides his Board; and every other Trade in Proportion has the ſame Advantage.</p>
            <p>There is a Poſt-Office lately erected, which goes to <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England, Charles-town</hi> in <hi>Carolina,</hi> and the other neighbouring Places. The uncultivated Ground, which is not grubb'd, ſells for ten times the Value it did at firſt; though there is none of that ſort within ten Miles round the City: And that within the Neighbourhood that was ſold for ten Pound at firſt, will fetch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three hundred now. All Women's Work is very dear there, and that proceeds from the ſmallneſs of the Number, and the Scarcity of Workers; for even the meaneſt ſingle Women marry well there, and being above Want are above Work. The Proprietor of this fine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (as I ſaid before) is <hi>William Pen,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who has a ſine Seat call'd <hi>Pensbury,</hi> built on three Iſlets, if I may ſo call 'em; for a Branch of the River <hi>Delaware</hi> runs thrice round it. In his Orchards and Gardens may be found all the

Fruits, Roots, and Herbs that are in <hi>England,</hi> and many more peculiar to the Country. There is very good Paper made in <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> Linen, Druggets, Crapes, Camblets, and Serges, with which they trade. Moſt of the Merchants, and ſome Tradeſmen, have handſome Country Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, well and conveniently furniſh'd. No Inſults from the <hi>Indians</hi> were ever heard of here, which is more than any of our other Plantations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Continent can ſay; neither are there any of them us'd as Slaves, but they are paid as well as the <hi>Europeans</hi> for their Commodities or Labour; and there are more Chriſtians among 'em than in any other Nation in <hi>America,</hi> for their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Moſt of them bring up their Children to read and write, and ſome of them are bound Apprentice to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who prove as good Workmen at the Buſineſs they follow as their Maſters. In ſhort, in the midſt of War they enjoy the Tranquility of Peace. They are too far diſtant from the Sea to fear the Invaſion of a foreign Enemy, and there are ſeveral Places of Strength upon the River of <hi>Delaware,</hi> before they can arrive at <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> Yet when I was there, the Town was alarm'd with a falſe Report that the <hi>French</hi> had landed within the Bay, and committed ſeveral Acts of Hoſtility. It was judg'd by ſome, that this Report was ſpread abroad, on purpoſe to ſee how active the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be to defend themſelves, and whether the <hi>Quakers</hi> were to be depended upon in caſe of an Invaſion. The Governor got at the Head of about 700 Men, and exhorted the <hi>Brethren</hi> to ſtand up for the Defence of their Lives and Eſtates; but they declar'd the carnal Weapon did not belong to them, yet they would retire and pray for us. The People of the Town brought out their Proviſion and Liquor, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0388100100:375"/>
freely gave it among the Soldiers, who made as free with it. Before Night, News came that it was a falſe Alarm, which I believe did not diſpleaſe any of us.</p>
            <p>In the Heat of the Day I ſometimes took a Walk with ſome of the Town to <hi>Fair Mount,</hi> a pleaſant Place ſhaded with Trees on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Schuylkill.</hi> As we were coming home one Day, deep in Diſcourſe with one another, as I was ſtepping over a Stile, I ſaw ſtretch'd on the Ground before me a Snake, as I ſuppoſe aſleep. I had not Power to draw my Leg back again, but my Foot fell juſt upon the Head and part of the Neck of the Reptile, more by the particular Direction of Providence, than my Deſign. It ſprung up ſo quick, and twiſted round my Right Leg and Body with ſuch Force that I was in Fear of being ſtrangled; however, I kept my Foot fix'd faſt upon its Head, and in a little time it fell down dead. It is almoſt impoſſible for Words to deſcribe what I felt at this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; the very Touch of it about my Leg and Body had very near taken away my Breath: and it was the greateſt Providence in the World I did not take my Foot from the Head of the Snake; for if I had, it would certainly have bit me. It was a conſiderable time before I could ſhake off my Apprehenſion, and I was downright ſick with the Fright the whole Day after. Some of my Companions had the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to meaſure it: It was in Length two Yards nine Inches, and ten Inches about from the Neck to within a Yard of the Tail. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member very well, after this Accident, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I had Occaſion to croſs a Stile, in <hi>Penſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> or <hi>Old England,</hi> I ever took Care to look before me; ſo laſting is the Impreſſion of Fear and Danger upon the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:0388100100:376"/>
I continu'd at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> near four Months, and was very well entertain'd by the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Place: I am pleas'd I have it in my Power to pay 'em my publick Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Thanks for all their Favours; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Reverend Mr. <hi>Brooks,</hi> whom I met with by Chance at <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> His Buſineſs there was to raiſe Subſcriptions for a new Church near <hi>New-York:</hi> When he heard of my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, he was ſo generous and charitable as to offer to lend me a Sum of Money he had in his Hands, upon my bare Word only, which I was to return to him from <hi>England</hi> by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for Propagating the Goſpel in Foreign Parts. As I was not in want of it, I did not accept his intended Favour, but I ſhall ever gratefully remember his kind Intentions.</p>
            <p>I muſt not forget the many Obligations I had the Honour to receive from his Excellency Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Evans,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> the Commiſſary, who was particularly civil to me. Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, tho' of the ſame Name, are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe related than by marrying the Daughters of Mr. <hi>Moor,</hi> the Collector of the King's Cuſtoms. The Commiſſary is juſt gone for <hi>Philadelphia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, having been in <hi>England</hi> near a Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month, about an Affair between the preſent Governor Sir <hi>William Keith</hi> and him, relating to the King's Cuſtoms. Among the reſt of my Friends, I muſt not forget the facetious Mr. <hi>Staples,</hi> Dancing-Maſter, who was the firſt Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> that did me the Honour of a Viſit, and to his merry Company I owe the paſſing of many a dull Hour, that probably might have lain heavy upon the Hands of a Man under my Circumſtances, depriv'd of Fortune, in a ſtrange Country, having no Friends, in whoſe Power it was to aſſiſt me, nearer than
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0388100100:377"/>
               <hi>England;</hi> for Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was too much involv'd in his own troubleſome Affairs at <hi>Bermuda,</hi> to expect any thing from him. But the Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> is rooted in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for it is the greateſt Crime among them not to ſhow the utmoſt Civility to Strangers: And if I were oblig'd to live out of my native Country, I ſhould not be long puzzled in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Place of Retirement, which ſhould be <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia.</hi> There the oppreſs'd in Fortune or Principles may find a happy <hi>Aſylum,</hi> and drop quietly to their Graves without Fear or Want.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> News arriv'd that the Fleet would be ready to ſail from <hi>Kaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> the latter End of the Month, ſo that I now began to bend my Thoughts towards my native Country. I pick'd up at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> four more Companions that intended the ſame Voyage; and <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5 we took leave of our Friends, and the lovely City of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which I ſhall always remember with the utmoſt Satisfaction. We hir'd a Boat to carry us down the <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> and lay the firſt Night at a Planter's, an Acquaintance of one of my Companions, who treated us with the uſual Civilities of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The next Day we din'd on Board our Boat, and at Night arriv'd at <hi>Lewis,</hi> about 50 Leagues from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and 20 from the Sea. We ſtaid here three Days. This Town is the Capital of <hi>Suſſex</hi> County, and is built upon the <hi>Hoorkill,</hi> a River that runs into the <hi>Delaware.</hi> A little below begins the Bay of <hi>Delaware,</hi> which is form'd by Cape <hi>William</hi> and Cape <hi>James,</hi> this laſt is the utmoſt Bounds of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi> While we ſtaid here, I had the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to go into the Woods to ſee 'em gather Honey, it being free for any one, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0388100100:378"/>
from its great Plenty; and you may buy the beſt Bees-wax at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for four Pence a Pound. At <hi>Lewis</hi> we had ſome of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Oyſters and Cockles I ever ſaw in my Life; ſome of the former were ſix Inches Diameter out of the Shell, and very well taſted. At this Place they make a rich Soup, compos'd of theſe, and other Shell-fiſh, which is very nouriſhing and palatable. From <hi>Lewis</hi> we were to walk over an Iſthmus of eight Mile, that parts <hi>Delaware</hi> River, and <hi>Cheſapeak</hi> Bay, which would ſave us three or four Days Sailing, for we had Notice of a Ship call'd the <hi>Globe,</hi> a new Veſſel of near five hundred Ton, and twenty-four Guns, that was at <hi>Kakatan,</hi> and would be willing to receive Paſſengers. We ſet out from <hi>Lewis</hi> with Horſes to carry what little Baggage we had, but we choſe to walk it on Foot our ſelves. We din'd at a pleaſant Plantation about the mid-way of our Journey, but found it a difficult matter to prevail upon a Couple of young Girls to come near us at firſt, for they took us for Privateers; but at laſt we prevail'd upon 'em, and they call'd their Father, &amp;c. who made very much of us. One of the Girls perceiving I had a Watch in my Hand to ſee what time of Day it was, begg'd to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; but it was very pleaſant to ſee her Fear, when ſhe touch'd it, and would not be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but it was alive, from its going and the Noiſe it made. I ask'd her if ſhe had never ſeen or heard of a Watch before. She told me ſhe had never ſeen one, but her Siſter had read of 'em. I only mention this to ſhew the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Innocence of thoſe Inhabitants of <hi>America,</hi> that live retir'd in the Country; for they told me they had neither of 'em been four
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0388100100:379"/>
Mile from their own Houſe in their Lives.</p>
            <p>We took Leave of our Planter and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and got that Night to a Plantation on <hi>Cheſapeak</hi> Bay, where we lay all Night, and were well entertain'd. The next Day we ſet about getting a Boat to carry us to <hi>Kakatan;</hi> but we met with a great deal of Difficulty in procuring one, and were three Days before we could ſucceed; but at laſt we got one by Accident, that was coming up the Bay. We got on Board, and arriv'd at <hi>Kakatan</hi> the ſame Evening. <hi>Kakatan</hi> is no more than a large Cove, where all the Fleet rendezvous in order to ſet Sail for <hi>England.</hi> There are ſome few Houſes ſcatter'd up and down the Bay, which go at great Rates upon this Occaſion. It lies about ten Leagues up the River of <hi>Cheſapeak;</hi> which River divides <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi> It is the greateſt River upon the Continent in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Dominions, and the fartheſt navigable up in the Country; and many other Rivers fall into it. We enquir'd for the <hi>Globe,</hi> and ſoon agreed with the Captain for his great Cabin, at a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Rate, and he ſeem'd pleas'd with his Company. We provided what little Neceſſaries we wanted, as ſome freſh Proviſions, Liquor, &amp;c. and on <hi>Sept.</hi> 4. the Commadore hung out the Signal for Sailing.</p>
            <p>I thought it was a noble Sight to ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ships under Sail all together. There were upwards of two hundred Sail of Merchant-Men, beſides four Sail of Men of War for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy.</p>
            <p>We drove down the River, and at Night got over-againſt the <hi>Virginia</hi> Capes, Cape <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and Cape <hi>Charles,</hi> which form the Mouth of <hi>Cheſapeak</hi> Bay. The next Day we left the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0388100100:380"/>
main Land aſtern, and we had Orders from the Commadore to ſpread our ſelves, for fear we ſhould fall foul of each other in the Night. We continu'd ſailing ſeveral Days together with a proſperous Gale. <hi>Sept.</hi> 28, the Skies threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd us with a Storm; we reev'd our Sails in Expectation of it, but it blew ſo violently at laſt that we were oblig'd to lie under a reeft Foreſail; and it was well we had a good ſtout Ship under us, or we had periſh'd. Our Fleet was ſoon ſcatter'd, and we ſaw ſeveral of them ſink in View, with their whole Crew; and it was not in the Power of the other Ships to ſuccour 'em. I now began to think I ſhould be bury'd in the Deep, tho' our Captain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gave us great Hopes in the Goodneſs and Strength of the Ship; for ſhe was well rigg'd and fitted, it being her firſt Voyage. We were terribly toſs'd all Night, and when the Morning dawn'd, we could not perceive one of the Fleet; ſo we were oblig'd to ſail alone, which gave me many melancholy Reflections: However, we had this to comfort us, that the Storm was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; and the next Day, to my great Joy, we diſcover'd forty of our ſcatter'd Fleet, and one Man of War. When we could come within Hailing, we receiv'd a diſmal Account of the Loſs of above thirty of the Fleet, that founder'd at Sea. Some of the Men were ſav'd, as alſo part of the Cargo of ſeven or eight, but the reſt went to the Bottom.</p>
            <p>One Reaſon of the Weakneſs of the Ships was their being unſheath'd; and ſtaying four Months beyond their uſual Time, the Worms had got into their Bottoms.</p>
            <p>We ſail'd together with a fair Wind till we came upon the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> and then we had
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0388100100:381"/>
the Misfortune of being diſpers'd in the Night; and our Danger was the greater in being ſo near an Enemy's Country. The next Day we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Sail making up to us: We ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd it was a <hi>French</hi> Privateer. There were three Ships of us in Company: we got together to conſult, and at laſt it was agreed to prepare for the Fight, though in a very poor Condition for an Engagement. Some of the Sailors ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd us to meet 'em, which Advice was taken. We immediately crouded all the Sail we could, and got our Hands upon Deck, Paſſengers and all; and having the Wind of 'em, we bore down upon 'em, which had the deſired Effect; for aſſoon as they perceiv'd us chaſing 'em, they made all the Sail they could to get from us, and in a little time got out of our Sight. We were very well pleas'd with our Stratagem, and continu'd our Courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 3, we diſcover'd <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Chalky Cliffs gave us all a vaſt Delight. We coaſted along the Channel with the pleaſing Hopes of once more fetting our Feet upon our native Country; and <hi>Nov.</hi> 7. we got ſafe into <hi>Deal</hi> Harbour. We ſtaid there but one Night, and hir'd Horſes to go to <hi>Canterbury;</hi> from whence we took a Coach to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and the next Day went in the Paſſage-Boat to <hi>London.</hi> As we were going up the River, a Ship out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward-bound came ſo ſuddenly upon us, that we were in the utmoſt Danger of being run over. Moſt of the Paſſengers got up, ready to lay hold of the Tackling of the Ship to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but by Providence, ſhe miſt us by about two Inches. This put me in Mind of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Human Life, and that a Man may
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0388100100:382"/>
meet with Death, when he imagines himſelf paſt all Danger.</p>
            <p>I landed at <hi>London, Nov.</hi> 15, 1710. I gave God Thanks for his many and ſignal Mercies, where I hope I am ſettled for the Remnant of my Life, without truſting my ſelf any more to the Dangers of the tempeſtuous Sea.</p>
