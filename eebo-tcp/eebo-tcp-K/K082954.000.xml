            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE defects of our ſyſtem of poor laws have lately engaged the attention of the public; and a variety of eminent writers upon the ſubject have diſcuſſed ſeveral parts of it with great ability: my object is, to add ſome ſupplemental remarks to what they have laid down, which I think may tend to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and confirm the opinions of thoſe who have recommended houſes of induſtry.</p>
            <p>The moſt eligible method of drawing up a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral plan for the ſupport of the poor would poſſibly be, to mark off in ſome of the beſt treatiſes which have been publiſhed upon the ſubject, ſuch principles and practical obſervation as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear moſt firmly founded upon political reaſon, or drawn from facts properly ſtated; theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached materials may be reduced to their general heads, and the vacancies in the outline eaſily marked in: an architect from a few veſtiges and ruined members of columns, is able with the greateſt degree of certainty to make a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the building in all its original magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: the happineſs of a great people, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0575401100:3"/>
worthy the ſame enlightened and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering attention, which has frequently been miſapplied to reſtore ſome gothic deſign of claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical antiquity.</p>
            <p>But it is by no means my intention to purſue the ſubject ſo extenſively: the only points I mean to go into are, the ſtate of the preſent bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and charge of the poors rate, the different expence of maintaining the poor in the preſent mode, and in incorporated diſtricts; and the probable amount of the advantage of adopting Mr. Gilbert's plan, with ſuch alterations as may be found neceſſary: I ſhall endeavour likewiſe to add ſomething to what has been ſaid upon the advantages of a better and more regular educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the poor, and how far ſuch incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are favourable or adverſe to the ſpirit of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt conſider the charge of the rate, laying down firſt this diſtinction, that by charge we are to underſtand the ſum paid, be the value of money what it will, by burthen, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſum to our ability to pay it. Mr. Potter, in a very ingenious pamphlet publiſhed laſt year upon this ſubject, ſtates the total a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the poor's rate at three millions, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0575401100:4"/>
advance in nine years at 800,000: during that period the price of proviſions has increaſed in a geometrical progreſſion, the increment of the poor rates has at laſt followed the ſame law, (<note n="*" place="bottom">Apendix, Note A. B.</note>two poſitions which will be demonſtrated in the Appendix) the rate of the 8th year will be 2,898,370l. and the augmentation of perpetual expence the ninth 101,630; and the value of this perpetuity, at 3½ per cent. 2,903,714; the increaſed charge therefore to the public, is equal to that ſum added to the funded debt at 3½ per cent. This augmentation gives the annual increaſe of the rate 3,506 per cent. and by the table in the Appendix, this rate of increaſe appears very moderate.</p>
            <p>Taking the ſurplus of the public revenue, which may in time of peace be applied to the diſcharge of the debt at 900,000l. a ſum it was ſuppoſed to produce before the annual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 400,000 from the Eaſt India company was withdrawn; the value of the perpetuity 2,903,714 exceeds that ſum in proportion as 3⅕ to 1.</p>
            <p>Hence the poor rate appears to increaſe the national expence three times as faſt as that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0575401100:5"/>
ſurplus can diminiſh it, uniformly applied to the diſcharge of that debt in the time of peace; ſuppoſing it to increaſe every year even with the ſame celerity as the poor rate.</p>
            <p>It may be worth while, in order to point out the true extent of a charge thus increaſing, to enquire what ſum of money the public ought to pay down, to be delivered from it for ever.</p>
            <p>Divide 100 by the difference of the rate of increaſe, and the rate of intereſt (uniformly taken at 3½) the quotient will be the number of years purchaſe of the original ſum, which will equal the required payment.<note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix, Note D.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe the 1ſt.</hi> If we ſuppoſe the rate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue perpetually the ſame, or without increaſe, it will be worth 28½ years purchaſe: let the preſent amount be 2,500,000 only, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe money will be 71,250,000.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe the 2d.</hi> Let the annual increment be 1½, or about ½, the increaſe of the price of proviſions; the number of years purchaſe will then amount to 50, and the ſum 125 millions: very nearly equal the funded debt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe the 3d.</hi> The leaſt rate of advance given in the tables, is 2,39 per cent. and to be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0575401100:6"/>
from a charge perpetually increaſing in that ratio, the public ought to give 90,09 years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; or a ſum exceeding 225 millions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe the 4th.</hi> But the increaſe of charge exceeds the rate of intereſt: if it were barely equal, the former ſubſtracted from the latter leaves no remainder, and the number of years purchaſe becomes 100/0, or infinite.</p>
            <p>The truth of this laſt concluſion may be eaſily proved in the following manner; the rate at the end of the firſt year becomes by the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition 103,5, the preſent value of which is 100; at the end of the ſecond year it is increaſed to 107,12, the preſent value of which is 100: rate of the third year 110,87, the fourth 114,75, the preſent value of each of which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 100; ſo that to be diſcharged from the next year's rate, we muſt pay down a ſum equal to the preſent or 100l.; for the next two 200; the three firſt years 300, or ſo many years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the preſent value of the rate as we mean to be diſcharged from: therefore to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from all future expence, we muſt pay down a ſum equal to the preſent rate, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the number of years to the end of time, or infinity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0575401100:7"/>How far the poor rate has been an increaſing burthen, is the next particular which offers itſelf to our conſideration.</p>
            <p>As ſpecie repreſents ſome real value in goods and commodities, the burthen of a rate muſt be in proportion to that real value which the ſpecie it raiſes repreſents; if at one time 100l. repreſent, or will purchaſe twice the real value in goods and neceſſaries which it does at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a man who pays 10l. to a rate at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer period, has double the real value taken from him which he would have in the latter; or the <hi>burthen</hi> is double upon him: in general, the burthen is always to be eſtimated by the value of money and the ſum conjointly, or their product: when the value of money augments, the burthen increaſes with it; when it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, it decreaſes in the ſame proportion.</p>
            <p>Having the rate of increaſe of the charge given, to determne that of the burthen, we muſt endeavour to diſcover the annual decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the value of money.</p>
            <p>The real value of a ſum of money at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent periods, is proportioned to the number of people it will maintain with the neceſſaries of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0575401100:8"/>The price of wheat, and the intereſt of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, have been both conſidered as the ſtandard of this value: the former, being perhaps the greateſt article of neceſſary conſumption, and much affecting the price of the reſt, will have a great effect upon it; but not one can riſe or fall without influencing it in ſome meaſure.</p>
            <p>The rate of intereſt is a ſtandard ſtill more inadequate: this rate has continued the ſame for ſome years laſt paſt, if particular circumſtances have not rather contributed to raiſe it: 100l. at the end of the year produces 3l. 10s. ten years after it produces the ſame ſum; but will that ſum at thoſe different periods repreſent or equal the ſame real value of the neceſſaries of life? To prove 100l. of the ſame value at the one period as at the other, we muſt make this aſſumption, that 3l. 10s. at the end, is equal in value, or repreſents the ſame real value with 3l. 10s. at the beginning; the very principle wanted to be proved.</p>
            <p>To determine the value of money, we muſt find the quantity of commodities in kind which a certain number of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in a year, and multiply each ſeparate quantity by its price in the given year, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe together for a total: repeat the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0575401100:9"/>
ſame operation for any other year, and the two ſums will be reciprocally as the value of money at thoſe periods: or the greater ſum will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the value of money at the cheaper period, the leſs at the dearer.</p>
            <p>But if we want to enquire into the law of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe, more of theſe periods muſt be taken, and the hypotheſis tried by the totals they exhibit.</p>
            <p>The account of the ſtate of the houſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry at Nacton, drawn up by order of the Houſe of Commons, contains all the different prices of wheat, beef, malt, and cheeſe for 17 years; and the variations for every year care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully marked: I reduced the different prices of each article in every year to a mean, and from thence formed the four tables given in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</p>
            <p>This account begins with the year from Eaſter 1757 to 58; the average of the firſt four years will give the mean price of wheat Michaelmas 59; the following four Michaelmas 63, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding five at Eaſter 68, and the laſt four Michaelmas 72: this operation is to be repeated with the other three tables, and we may thus obtain a correct ſtate of the advance upon each of theſe commodities for thirteen years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0575401100:10"/>To aſcertain the quantities conſumed in kind of each of theſe particulars, I copied an account of the conſumption of eight weeks, from the books of the houſe of induſtry at Heckingham; this gives us the total conſumption of 2016 perſons for one week, from whence we eaſily deduce that of ten perſons for a year. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the quantity of every article of this reſult by its price in each of the four years above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the ſum of the prices of all the articles in each year will be as the value of money that year, if thoſe articles had compriſed all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life.</p>
            <p>To inſert the reſt, I computed from the beſt information I could procure, and principally derived from the ſame houſe, the additional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence at this preſent, for cloathing, fireing, &amp;c. and found it amount to 30s. a man. I then ſuppoſed the advance upon theſe articles, two thirds that of the others, that I might be ſure the concluſion might be below the truth.</p>
            <p>The reſult of theſe operations gives us the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing rate of increaſe for the price of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:

            <p>Theſe coincide ſo nearly with the numbers above them, as to point out that ſuch a law nearly took place. Whatever the cauſe of this decrement of the value of money may have been, it ſeems nearly uniform for the given time.</p>
            <p>The annual decrement of the value of money during the whole period was 2,89 per cent. but in the firſt four years, it amounted to 3,63 per cent. The rate of advance of the price of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was conſiderably more from 59 to 63, than from 63 to the preſent time; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the general received opinion; it appears in thoſe four years to have been accelerated ,75 annually per cent. nearly ¼ more than its mean increaſe: the four years from whence the ſecond term is obtained, are the years 61, and thoſe immediately following; and this irregularity ſeems to form no objection to the law, but to be the effect of the great ſums of money the ſucceſſes of the laſt war brought into the nation: a cauſe which was barely beginning to operate
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0575401100:12"/>
in the firſt period of four years, the average of which is therefore nearer its true level.</p>
            <p>I have choſen to explain the principles upon which theſe tables are grounded at ſome length, as the conſequences deduced from them, upon a very important queſtion treated of in the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, differ from what is delivered by ſome very reſpectable writers.</p>
            <p>From what has been here laid down, we are able to determine the ratio of increaſe of the burthen of the poor rate: an eſtate which laſt year paid to the rate 100, will be by the average advance charged 103,506 for the expence of the preſent; but by the riſe of proviſions 102,89 at the end of a year, is equal in value to 100 at the beginning; therefore the burthen of thoſe two periods will be in proportion of 102,89 to 103,506, or as 100 to 100,6, and the advance of the charge is to the advance of the burthen as 6 to 1 nearly.</p>
            <p>The further obſervations I had to make upon this head are referred to the Appendix;<note n="*" place="bottom">Note E.</note> I have there demonſtrated the operations of this payment upon the price of proviſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0575401100:13"/>The laſt thing remaining is to determine the probable ſaving to the public, by adopting a general bill for houſes of induſtry.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall be able to give a much more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain anſwer to the queſtion, by enquiring what would probably have been the ſum ſaved, if ſuch a bill had taken place at the ſame time Colnies and Carlton hundreds were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and having diſcovered that, we ſhall eaſily determine the advantage ſought.</p>
            <p>The year ending at Eaſter 1753, was the middle term of the ſeven years, from which their average charge was aſſeſt: I collected the rates of ten pariſhes for that year and the year 74, ſix of them ſituated near the incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated hundred, and added to them four pariſhes in Norfolk: the charge in the firſt of theſe years amounted to 806..6, &amp;c. and in the laſt to 1345..5, &amp;c. the annual rate of advance appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be 2,39 per cent. Upon theſe grounds we find the preſent value of all the payments of a diſtrict equal to the incorporated hundreds for the laſt 17 years; the difference between this ſum and the preſent value of all the payments of the corporation, adding the balance between
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0575401100:14"/>
their debt and ſtock, will give the amount of the ſum ſaved in ſeventeen years paſt.</p>
            <p>The annual payment of the hundreds is 1487..13, &amp;c. which increaſing in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuppoſed, would have become at the latter period 2506..7: from this we obtain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable preſent value of the ſums which would have been expended for maintaining the poor in the hundred,<note n="*" place="bottom">Note D.</note>

            <p>The rate of intereſt in theſe computations has been taken 4 per cent. the rate of advance of the charge has been taken 2,39; while the price of proviſions by the table has increaſed 2,89 per cent. this muſt be far beneath the average increaſe; as the price of labour though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what augmented, has not increaſed faſter, or even equally with the price of neceſſaries; and

the number of paupers relieved has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally increaſing: all theſe circumſtances toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have co-operated to leſſen the account given of the value of the charge of maintaining the poor under the preſent laws.</p>
            <p>On the other hand the ſum ſaved at Nacton has been the leaſt of any houſe I have exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the weekly expence of a pauper excluſive of repairs, furniture, ſurgeons and officers, has been at Nacton 2s. 7d. at Melton 2s. 1½d. and at Heckingham 1s. 10½d. either of the two latter would have given the advantages much more.</p>
            <p>A method which would have brought us far nearer the truth, would have been to have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the mean advance of the rates exhibited in the table as the advance of the poors rate, and compared the total expence for ſeventeen years upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, with the mean ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a houſe of induſtry; the weekly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence at Melton approaches neareſt to ſuch a medium.</p>

            <p>The probable amount of the rates of Colnies increaſing every year 3,506 per cent. would be at the end of ſeventeen years equal the average 1487 l. multipied by 1,03506<hi rend="sup">22</hi>; twenty-two years being paſt ſince the year when the amount equaled the average; this difference therefore is 32,933 years purchaſe of the preſent rate: if therefore a bill had been paſſed at that period to have incorporated ⅔ of the kingdom, as ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

above, the preſent value of the paſt and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaving would at this time have been 65,866,000; or (taking intereſt at 3½ per cent) at its firſt eſtabliſhment ſeventeen years ſince, 36,701,000 l. which was the value then, of the difference of expence to the nation, between the two modes of providing for the poor.</p>
            <p>But the annual increaſe of the rates ſince has a little exceeded the diſcount on the former ſum, therefore the preſent value of the difference is at leaſt ſixty-five million.</p>
            <p>The future expence 137384 is nearly equal 54 × 2506 and therefore about fifty-four years purchaſe of the preſent rates.</p>
            <p>The rate of annual advance in this ſtate per cent. 2,18 about 9/10 of the leaſt increaſe near the preſent period, I have been able to diſcover.</p>
            <p>And the charge of the two different modes is to each other, as 88884 to 193450; or as 1 to 2 2/11 very nearly.</p>
            <p>If we ſuſpect a concluſion to be exaggerated which brings out the value of a rate fifty-four years purchaſe, the reſult of the following ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may tend to deſtroy the objections we entertain againſt it: Admit the true value of a rent charge to be ſo high as 3½ per cent. and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0575401100:22"/>
that for twenty-five years laſt paſt, the rates of a pariſh have increaſed in the ſame proportion we have ſeen them for a conſiderable period laſt paſt, and then ſtop forever: how many years purchaſe of the firſt year's rate is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ſuch a perpetual payment?</p>
            <p>Here the rate of increaſe ſomewhat exceeds the rate of intereſt; but admitting it to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and the rates of the pariſh 100 l. a year: by reaſoning as before on the ſame caſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent value of the firſt twenty-five years pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the beginning of the term will be 2500 l. or twenty-five years purchaſe; the remaining perpetuity at the end of the term, will be worth the rate of the twenty-ſixth year, multiplied by 28½ the number of years purchaſe it is worth, if it continues without augmentation for ever: but the preſent value of that rate at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the twenty-five years is equal 100 l. and the value of the perpetuity 2850 l. or 28½ years purchaſe of the original rate: ſuch a rate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appears to be worth 25 × 28½ = 53½ years purchaſe; the reduced hypotheſis gives it fifty-four years.</p>
            <p>A pariſh which twenty-five years ago had given to redeem its poor rates, the then preſent
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0575401100:23"/>
vale of all the ſums it has paid ſince, added to the perpetuity of the preſent rate, would have ſaved all the probable future advance upon it; therefore 53½ years purchaſe was leſs than the value of ſuch a rate by all the probable future ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; an hypotheſis which ſtates it at 54, muſt fall nearly as far below the truth — we ſee that all the reaſons which might have been then urged againſt its being an eligible contract, would at this inſtant been refuted by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the paſt period; and what arguments can be now brought againſt it, which could not have been urged with equal or ſuperior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability then; they had not then to encounter and bear of the paſt period.</p>
            <p>But to remove every degree of doubt about the reſult, I added together the rates of all the pariſhes which I had taken for long periods: all of them but one accidentally happen to give the loweſt annual increaſe; the rate of increaſe of the whole thus added was ſomething under the general advance, being equal to 3,4742 per cent. the rates for the term of twenty-five years were worth at the beginning of that period 24,09, and the remainder of the perpetuity 28,39; the whole 52,48: which deducted form 54, leaves

about 1½ years purchaſe of the rates twenty-five years ſince, or about 17/26 of the value of a rate at preſent, as equal to all the future advances which may happen.</p>
            <p>That I may finiſh here every thing that relates to calculation, I ſhall add ſome obſervations on the bills of mortality in houſes of induſtry; on the proportion of power to be granted to guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and directors; and on the probablility of theſe inſtitutions being neglected in future pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods.</p>
            <p>The regiſters in houſes of induſtry have uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been kept in the general mode: But the names of the paupers who died, with their ages and diſtempers, and day of admiſſion into the houſe, has been generally entered into the report book at Heckingham ſince March 1772: by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that entry, and ſuch information as the governor ſupplied me with concerning ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a period, I was able to diſtinguiſh thoſe who died of diſtempers with which they were admitted into the houſe, from thoſe who died by diſorders contracted after their entry: the number of the former in this period were 70, of the latter 123; but during this term a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever raged very much both in the houſe and country from Chriſtmas 73 to Midſummer 74;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0575401100:25"/>
in periods of average health theſe numbers were as 21 to 22; and therefore taking a medium between theſe proportions, the corrected reſult comes out as 21 to 29, and the deaths 29/50 of the total exhibited by the regiſters: as theſe diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have not been made in thoſe returns to the houſe of commons I have ſeen, I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inſert them here, to obviate an objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which might otherwiſe be very reaſonably made to the mortality of the ſeveral houſes.</p>
            <p>In the time of the general illneſs mentioned, forty-nine died admitted ill from the country, and an hundred and one reſident in the houſe; this diſorder, which was of the putrid kind, was brought into the houſe from the country: the ſtate of the air ſeemed at that time particularly fatal to old perſons, of the latter number no leſs than twenty were above ſeventy-five; the ſmall pox carried off ſix or ſeven, and three were loſt by inoculation; incidents which will reduce the number nearly to its juſt proportion.</p>
            <p>When we want information we are generally ſo happy as to diſcover, what would have been the proper form to digeſt records, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are ſo kept as to be of very little uſe; I am ſenſible that the ſcale upon which theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0575401100:26"/>
are formed, is not ſo extenſive as it ought to be; but they are the beſt grounds I could procure: I had drawn up ſome obſervations upon regiſters before I knew what had been done upon that ſubject by Dr. Price, I incorporated his obſervations afterward with my own, and have given them in the Appendix.</p>
            <p>It was an obſervation of one of the directors of this houſe, and confirmed by the governor, that the children when admitted had too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a very meagre emaciated appearance; and that the difference between thoſe newly entered, and thoſe who had been in the houſe ſome time, was very ſtriking: in that caſe it muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a number of uſeful lives to ſociety.</p>
            <p>The only ſufficient reaſon for entruſting a ſet of men with the exerciſe of any power, or the expenditure of a certain revenue, is their intereſt in the application of it, or their ability or both conjointly: in conſidering theſe particulars we ſhall eaſily determine how far the old law, which in its operation has flung the diſpoſition of the ſums collected for the poor into the hands of the overſeers in the firſt inſtance, was political or right; we ſhall be thence likewiſe able to form an idea, what weight their diſſent to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0575401100:27"/>
incorporation of a particular diſtrict ought to carry; and with what reaſon they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of an abridgement of their powers by the late acts.</p>
            <p>The average length of leaſes throughout the kingdom is difficult to aſcertain; but though we cannot aſſign a term of years which ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely equal it, we may aſſume one, which we are ſenſible from the nature of things muſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceed it: to compute the proportional inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the landlord and tenant in the poor rates, I have therefore ſuppoſed all the lands in the kingdom under leaſes of fourteen years, and upon that ſuppoſition the intereſt of the owners to that of the occupiers will be as 14⅔ to 1: but this gives the tenant's intereſt greatly above the true value; had we ſtated the average length of leaſes at nine years, it would have fallen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably ſhort of half as much.</p>
            <p>Had theſe two claſſes of men been equally raiſed above temptation, equally enlightned with reſpect to the true political principles upon which the extenſive detail of police depends, in that caſe ſuch would have been the proportion in which authority juſtly would have been diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to them: it is true, that among the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0575401100:28"/>
there are perſons to be found reſpectable for their character and information; I am not certain whether Emerſon farms his own eſtate: but a conſtant attendance upon their own affairs, and an education not training them much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, will ſtamp a general character upon the whole claſs, which will render them improper for public duties: yet ſuch is the order of the the people to whom the ſpirit of the laws now in being commits the expenditure of a revenue, whoſe preſent purchaſe appears to be equal to the national debt: expoſed to the peculation or miſmanagement of every diſhoneſt or ignorant man to whoſe charge it is intruſted: experience points out what numbers may be fairly ranged under both theſe heads—an error in legiſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perhaps ſingle in its kind.</p>
            <p>The magiſtrate has by law ſome check upon the officer; but the inſtances of poſſible miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct are ſo numerous, that the remedy in its operation is far from being in any degree equally extenſive with the evil —Every ſubſequent check poſſible may be provided, but where the expenditure of a fund in the firſt inſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuperior direction, is lodged in the hands of the moſt improper claſs of people, the manner
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0575401100:29"/>
in which it will be applied will be ſtrongly marked with the characters of the men: a ſtream which takes its riſe and flows over a ſoil full of mineral particles will imbibe all its nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious qualities; nor will it be greatly altered by the addition of a trifling rivulet, which may fall into it in ſome part or other of its courſe.</p>
            <p>But to this it may be replied, "that there will be little advantage reſulting to the public, from removing theſe powers out of the hands of perſons who may abuſe, to place them in the hands of thoſe who will abſolutely neglect the uſe of them; while the ſpirit which planned and formed a new inſtitution ſubſiſts, the attendance given by the managers is conſtant; but like every other kind of enthuſiaſm it is ſtrongeſt at its firſt apparance; difficulties in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on damp it, but the tedium of attendance wear it out entirely: the original inſtitutors had a kind of perſonal attachment to their own plan, which engaged many others to a duty which bore the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of perſonal attention to them; but to their ſucceſſors it is only a common care in which they are equally engaged with many; this is a ſecond and certain ſource of diminution of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and what is the ſum total which we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0575401100:30"/>
obtain by the alteration of eſtabliſhed ſyſtems? to exchange old abuſes with old names, for old abuſes with new ones.</p>
            <p>This is an objection which has been much dwelt upon; we muſt meaſure the effect of theſe cauſes to diminiſh the attendance of directors by what experience has already pointed them out to be: the moſt proper inſtance will be that of the oldeſt eſtabliſhment of this kind, where they will diſcover themſelves moſt fully and clearly: and here it has happened that every one of the cauſes mentioned in the objection have operated with greater force than in any other inſtance which (to the beſt of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) can be produced: the average numbers attending the annual meetings at Nacton from 60 to 75 incluſive, were for the firſt five years ten, the ſecond 12⅖, the third 134/5, and in the laſt year 20: the book from whence I extracted this account goes back no further than 1760.</p>
            <p>Another branch of ſubject which I propoſed to conſider was the advantages of a better and more regular education, which this ſyſtem in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree provides for the poor.</p>
            <p>The elegant and fanciful Rouſſeau has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked all education in general; and made
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0575401100:31"/>
happineſs to conſiſt in every human ſavage, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone in his cave, being very dirty, wearing no cloaths, and keeping his nails long enough to dig his own pignuts; this puts him above the artificial wants contracted in ſociety: but a much ſuperior philoſopher of our own country has particularly written againſt the education of the poor; and very clearly demonſtrated that ſharpers, highwaymen, and pickpockets, were the moſt patriot characters: his concluſion from this principle was very properly drawn: you muſt ſuffer your poor to remain uneducated, otherwiſe they will not be quite ſo beneficial to the public.</p>
            <p>Bad principles in philoſophy joined with great and uſeful diſcoveries, ſeem to have the ſame fortune with the little qualities of great men: they have ſo much falſe luſture flung upon them by the neighbourhood they ſtand in, that they almoſt ſeem to ſhine by their own light: it is particularly unlucky for my preſent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that theſe objections againſt the utility of education ſtand in ſuch reſpectable company; that will be enough to deter me from attacking them in detail, but not from laying down what I think may be urged on the contrary ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0575401100:32"/>The man who writes, and the man who reads, have frequently very different opinions of the importance of the branch of the ſubject under preſent conſideration; but the conſequences which I think may be drawn from this head, will induce me to go into it with particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>Thoſe paſſions whoſe irregular indulgencies produce the worſt effects in ſociety, do not attain any degree of ſtrength before the period of a common education is paſſed; and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſympathy and compaſſion implanted in mind by nature, diſcover themſelves there a long while previous to them: for this reaſon, in the earlier ſtages of life, we receive and retain impreſſions of virtue much eaſier than thoſe of vice; on account of their nearer analogy to that ſet of emotions which then reign in their full ſtrength, while thoſe which afterwards attain more than power enough to counterbalance them, have not yet arrived at force or maturity.— Impreſſions of this kind early made on the mind, are long retained; and being frequently repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by virtue of that repetition become ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and habitually infixed, as to obtain the ſame force and permanent efficacy with thoſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0575401100:33"/>
originally ſtamped there by nature: in this manner a few firſt principles early inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and frequently repeated, win their way into the heart, and maturer years fortify by reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what habit before had rendered almoſt a ſecond nature.</p>
            <p>We cannot long perſonate any character but that ſome part of it will attach itſelf to us and become our own; that warmth with which we endeavour to render the deception compleat, carries us beyond the mark deſigned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts appearance into reality: the conſtant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an internal principle produces the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance of it; and by a kind of reflex operation, the aſſuming the external appearance, conſtantly fortifies or even gives birth to the internal principle: we have frequently ſeen a bare external ſhew of religion improve into ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine piety; while a mock defence of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate maxims of the <hi>morales lubriques,</hi> or an air of libertiniſm worn in the gaiety of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy hour, has fixed a bias on the mind which has not with eaſe been ſhaken off: thoſe who have attacked the utility of all inſtitutions for the education of the children of the poor, have owned that they produce an external appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0575401100:34"/>
of decorum, induſtry, and aſſiduity, the tendency of theſe external appearances to ſtrike deeper root, and improve into reality, converts this conceſſion into a ſtrong argument in favour of ſuch inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>To live agreeably in any ſociety, our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conduct muſt be ſuch as not to draw upon ourſelves any particular degree of diſeſteem from it: few people I believe were ever ſo abſurd as to go for pleaſure, or even to propoſe tolerable conveniency to themſelves, in a road where there is an inceſſant multitude continually thronging the oppoſite way: elbowed on one ſide, puſhed on another, 'tis hard to ſtruggle againſt popular opinion: there are not many practical principles whoſe operations by an inſpection into the actions of mankind at large we can diſcover to be ſo extenſive, and in their effects ſo infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: a kind of external force operating upon us either prevents us from deviating from that train of action public opinion has marked out for us, or the pain we receive from every excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity quickly recals us to it: if we ſhould admit that the efficacy of that education I am recommending extends no further than correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our opinions, without correcting our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0575401100:35"/>
the oblique effect of ſuch reformation of our ſentiment muſt be well worth ſecuring, and be productive of the moſt advantageous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to the manners and morals of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Let us endeavour to trace its effects from the obſervation I had before laid down: a man who by a better education is improved only in his judgment of virtue and vice, when the merits of an individual with whom he is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected by relation, prejudice or favour, comes to be diſcourſed of, will candidly pronounce of them according to thoſe improved ſentiments he has imbibed; far the greater part of ſociety ſtand in this very identical relation to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of which it is compoſed; hence the public at large will appreciate the merits of any action the better, the more generally thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipales by which it ought to be judged are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; that general cenſure on every deviation becomes more preciſe, more enlightened, and more certainly paſſed: the train of action mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by public opinion being rendered more agreeable to the laws of reaſon and virtue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more agreeable to the public intereſt, and in the path thus marked out for them, the generality of mankind will always walk. But
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0575401100:36"/>
whatever lights the ſuperior part of mankind may thus enjoy, if they do not reach the claſs below, they will certainly fail of producing this effect among them. If a man do not run counter to the ſentiments of that claſs of life in which his principal connections lay, to violate the ideas of right or wrong entertained by thoſe much above, or much below, can little affect him; in this reſpect he may be ſaid to live in a different ſociety; and from hence ariſes the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that theſe grounds of judgment ſhould be equally diffuſed in every rank of life.</p>
            <p>Nor does it form a reaſonable objection to ſuch an education, <q>that its effects are by no means infallible: that nature and paſſion will frequently triumph over ſuch ſlight obſtacles as habit and education oppoſe to them; that their efficacy is always found leaſt when the moſt urgent neceſſity calls for their ſupport: there are ſome men whoſe violent appetites tranſport them with ſuch exceſs, that no edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation can infuſe a proper counterpoiſe to them; other whoſe paſſions balanced in the exacteſt moral equilibrium, are ſo harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized as to preclude the neceſſity of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of inſtruction; with the former it muſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0575401100:37"/>
be inefficatious, with the latter ſuperfluous.</q> But in the ſcale of human diſpoſitions there are many intermediate degrees between theſe two extreme limits, near which we find them very thinly ſcattered; and almoſt every character occupies a ſpace much nearer the middle point than is commonly aſſigned; conſequently the conſtant operation of habit and education (though their power were much leſs than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhows it to be) may determine on which ſide they ſhall be found; and it would be abſurd to reject any deſign generally uſeful, becauſe its benefit could not be extended to every uncommon caſe an inventive imagination can propoſe.—Education operates on the mind with a gentle and ſecret influence: yet this unſeen bias, though not diſcoverable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in one or two particular inſtances, will be clearly diſcerned in a ſeries of many actions, and form the predominant character of them. It is like a ſlight bias given to a die; which in a large number of caſts will not fail to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate itſelf in a degree proportioned to its ſtrength, with ſuch a regulated certainty that we are able almoſt infallibly before hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine its preciſe effect, though from ſome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0575401100:38"/>
aſſignable cauſes, it may not be indicated in a ſingle experiment.</p>
            <p>Though the general inſtitution of houſes of induſtry will not provide for the education of all the children of the poor, yet the good effect which would reſult from a general proviſion will be anſwered in proportion to the extent of the partial proviſion propoſed.</p>
            <p>The reaſoning above laid down ſeems in ſome degree confirmed by an effect already experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: it was an obſervation of the governor of one of thoſe houſes I have viſited, that the children born in the houſe or admitted very young, were the moſt orderly and induſtrious: thoſe whoſe relations or parents came into the houſe with them, being abetted and encouraged by their friends, were extremely irregular and idle; and that this difference in their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was very perceptible. A remark which clearly points out two facts very important to the preſent ſubject, that the training the children of the poor receive in their cottages is of the worſt kind, and that the education and controul of a houſe of induſtry provides an adequate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0575401100:39"/>But theſe inſtitutions have been attacked upon another ground: it has been alledged that <q>a pauper is deprived of his civil liberty by being ſhut up in one of theſe magnificent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and put under the controul of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor: nor does the inconſiſtency end here, every law ſhould have a certain analogy to the principle upon which the government of a ſtate is founded: where it is inconſiſtent with it, it claſhes with and tends to weaken that principle if it be only local; if general, it ſaps its very foundation: this maxim is the fundamental ground of the true ſpirit of law in every country: the principle of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is civil liberty, and can that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple remain unimpaired, when a law is made, which actually reduces a great number, and ſubjects half a people to a probability of perſonal confinement?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before we admit this reaſoning (which I think I have propoſed in its full force) it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſee how low down the idea of civil liberty can extend in the freeſt government; and in what manner a diſciple of Locke, the moſt enlightened and zealous advocate of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, would take it up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0575401100:40"/>Every man, he would reply, when he enters into ſociety, gives up a certain proportion of his natural liberty to the magiſtrate, in return for the protection he receives from him; and the remainder, after ſuch a ſurrender, is called his civil liberty. If beſide protection he want maintenance, and have no property to procure it, he then becomes a ſervant to ſome individual; which<note n="*" place="bottom">Locke on civil government, B. II. c. 7.</note> 
               <q>commonly puts him into the family of his maſter, and under the ordinary diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline thereof; and gives his maſter a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary power over him, which extends to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contained in the contract and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—that maſter and ſervant are names as old as hiſtory,</q> that is, as the hiſtory of civilized ſociety and human happineſs. If the ſtate or a diſtrict which provides maintenance for thoſe who have no property to procure it, do not acquire the ſame rights over the perſons maintained, it muſt be from ſome difference in the circumſtances of the caſe. A ſervant goes into the family of his maſter and the <hi>ordinary diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> thereof—by an expreſs contract into which he is obliged to enter by the impoſſibility of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0575401100:41"/>
without it; from which he <hi>cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged</hi> until the end of his contract, if he be able to ſupport himſelf in a manner he likes better: the ſervice he undertakes to do in return for maintenance and wages <hi>generally overpaying conſiderably the expence to his maſter.</hi>—A pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per enters into a houſe of induſtry provided by the diſtrict, and <hi>the diſcipline thereof defined by written laws</hi>—by a tacit contract into which he is obliged to enter by the impoſſibility of ſubſiſting without it—from which <hi>he is of courſe diſcharged</hi> if he be able to ſupport himſelf in a manner he likes better—and his ſervice in return for maintenance and gratuities is generally <hi>much beneath the expence</hi> to the diſtrict. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences then appear to be theſe, the ſervant is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ordinary diſcipline of his maſter's houſe, which in its nature muſt be ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary—the pauper in a houſe of induſtry to a diſcipline defined by written laws—the ſervant is not diſengaged from his maſter until the end of his contract, although he be able to ſupport himſelf in a manner he likes better—in that caſe the pauper is of courſe diſcharged—the laſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in which theſe ſtates are contradiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, appears to be that the ſervices of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0575401100:42"/>
former are beneficial to the individual, thoſe of the latter do not nearly repay the expences of the diſtrict which maintains him—What rights can the pauper retain in the latter caſe, where upon the whole he is a burthen upon the public, which the ſervant has not a tittle to in the former, where upon the whole his labours are beneficial to the individual would be difficult to diſcover: the only reaſon which can make againſt a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict having this power is, that it reduces the poor to a worſe ſituation than the preſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being attended with any conſiderable benefit to ſociety: the error of the former part of this reaſoning has been very ably refuted by an<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Potter's obſervations, p. 25, 31.</note> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial ſtate of their ſituations under both theſe ſyſtems, which the enquiries I have made upon this ſubject enable me to pronounce not exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated: that of the latter I flatter myſelf to have demonſtrated in the former part of this eſſay.</p>
            <p>After all, is it certain that the liberty remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the poor, conſidered as an aggregate body, is at all abridged by theſe inſtitutions? or that it does not gain in one reſpect more than it loſes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0575401100:43"/>
in another? A pauper at preſent cannot remove from the place of his ſettlement without a certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, which the officers may refuſe to grant; the general adminiſtration of this law is nearly as rigorous as the ſpirit of it: in diſtricts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the latter acts of incorporation, a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>muſt</hi> be granted for the pauper to remove to any place within them: the liberty of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by the old law circumſcribed to a ſingle pariſh, is by the new one extended to large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict; all the poor are benefited by this enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while but a ſmall part of them are put under the reſtraint complained of: balance theſe circumſtances, and we ſhall be induced to think, that the poor enjoy upon the whole a greater proportion of civil liberty under the new than old law.</p>
            <p>We may further obſerve, that this new ſyſtem in its conſequences is highly favourable to every improvement in legiſlation, and the ſpirit of that civil liberty to which it is held out as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſubverſive: the happineſs and freedom of every ſtate depend ultimately upon the laws by which it is governed—If we enquire what is the leaſt poſſible reſtraint of law in a ſtate? the anſwer will be, it ought to be ſuch as added to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0575401100:44"/>
the reſtrant which the manners of a people op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to thoſe irregularities which deſtroy the peace of ſociety, forms a ſufficient counterpoize to thoſe paſſions which would betray us into them, for if it be leſs it is inadequate, if more unneceſſary: and every unneceſſary reſtraint is a degree of deſpotiſm. An inſtitution which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the manners of ſociety, makes way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a more moderate and improved ſyſtem of legiſlation: agreeably to theſe obſervations it has been found, that thoſe refinements in civil policy which take place in polite ages and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would be of no uſe when endeavoured to be put in practice in a hoard of barbarians, on account of their ſavage ferocity of manners: as theſe manners have gradually improved, laws (<note n="*" place="bottom">Are the laws you have given the Athenians the beſt ſyſtems poſſible?

But theſe advanced virtues muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated through the greater part of ſociety before thoſe ſucceſſive amendments in legiſlation can be introduced; and here we diſcover in a ſtriking light the further utility of thoſe inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which tend ſo eminently to reform the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and manners of the inferior members of the ſtate, of which that majority is compoſed: every advancement toward a more perfect ſyſtem of laws, in its turn promotes the virtue of ſociety: theſe reciprocal improvements are in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner multiplied to a degree of infinity, like the images of an object placed between two oppoſite reflectors.</p>
            <p>When we ſurvey the manners of mankind in this ſtate of continual and gradual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the proſpect ſo much brightens upon us, that we are led to imagine, that thoſe excellent forms of government and regulations of ſociety, which have ſubſiſted only in the minds of a few abſtracted philoſophers, will ſome ages hence be actually realized. If one view the gradual advances which have taken place in the ſcience of legiſlation, we ſhall diſcover, that they have always had a tendency to this, as that

ultimate point to which nature originally deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed human ſociety to attain and reſt in, and which alone is worthy that noble appellation, <hi>the State of Nature.</hi> I am not now to be told that this is looked upon rather as a matter of curious ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the ingenious amuſement of a few men of refined imagination, than as a thing which ever can exiſt: the negative of ſuch a queſtion ought always to be maintained, with the ſame diffidence and reſerve with which the affirmative is advanced: there are certainly ſome inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which now exiſt, and are celebrated as maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pieces of policy, which the moſt penetrating politicians once cenſured, as plauſible in idea, but what would be found in the execution, chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical and impracticable: I venture to aſſign as an inſtance of this, the noble edifice of the conſtitution of England; planned by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, founded by the labours, cemented by the blood of a long illuſtrious line of legiſlators, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, and heroes.

                  <head>On the Burthen of the Public Debt.</head>
                  <p>A Writer of the firſt abilities, Dr. Price, has in a late publication repreſented the burthen of the national debt to be ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, as to threaten the ſubverſion of public credit: as the data I have collected to point out to what degree the burthen of the poor rate is augmented, and the principles laid down to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it, appeared to me during my enquiries upon this latter ſubject to apply equally to the former, I ſhall endeavour to diſcover upon theſe grounds what has been the increaſe of the public burthen ſince the commencement of the laſt war, what operation it has had upon the price of proviſion, and the probable period in which we may expect to be able to diſcharge it.</p>
                  <p>There cannot be a ſubject on which an error on either ſide can be attended with worſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; an opinion of the near danger of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic bankruptcy produces almoſt all the evils which could come upon us were the danger
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0575401100:49"/>
real: it annihilates public credit, it tempts the attacks of our enemies, to which our ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fears make us oppoſe a very ineffectual reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; it deſtroys that public vigour, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering ſpirit of private enterprize, which form the beſt treaſure and happineſs of a ſtate, and even where they do not find ability create it. —But the danger is equal on the oppoſite ſide: When a nation has but a few laſt means of ſafety left, if they be ſquandered away by a confidence in reſources which do not exiſt, it renders certain and precipitates a ruin which wiſer meaſures might have avoided.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible of the difficulty and extent of the ſubject; which is to be enquired into upon the principles of a ſcience which I never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued to any great length, and which I have ſome years entirely laid aſide; and believe I ſhould have ſuppreſſed any obſervations which might have occurred to me upon it, if the enlightened attention of the public which ſome late writers of great merit have called out, had not rendered it almoſt impoſſible for any error to paſs into a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral opinion.</p>
                  <p>The burthen of a tax, or the total taxes of a country, muſt be in proportion to that part of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0575401100:50"/>
the ſubſiſtence of the people which it takes away: if a tax took away 1/10 part of the ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a people twenty years ſince, and an equal portion at this preſent time, its burthen is preciſely equal: if it take away more it increaſes, if leſs it diminiſhes: Money repreſents ſome real value in goods and commodities, and if a tax at two different periods take away the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of 1/10 of our ſubſiſtence, the buthen of that tax upon a people at thoſe different times is equal.</p>
                  <p>In this calculation and thoſe which follow I take the ſum of our annual charges and my data in general from Dr. Price: the amount of the taxes in 55 was 5,097,617, excluſive of the land tax at two ſhillings in the pound 866,666; and the total payment 5,964,283: from which the difference of the burthen in that year, and the year 74, when the total amount of the taxes was ten million, is eaſily derived: we are firſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate what ſum of money in 74 was of equal value with the ſum of the taxes in 55; this term comprehends nineteen years, admit the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of money to have decreaſed at the rate of 2,16 per cent. annually, for the whole term: the real
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0575401100:51"/>
value then of 5,964,283 in 55, was equal to 5,964283 × 1,0216<hi rend="sup">19</hi> or 8,963,800, in 74: or theſe ſums at thoſe periods were equal burthens upon the people.</p>
                  <p>The taxes in 1774 amounted to ten millions; the proportion of the public burthens in 55 and 74 was as 89638 to 100,000; or as 1 to 1, 11: but the reſult would have been as 1 to 1, 67, if we had confounded the charge and the burthen as the ſame thing; a mode of proceeding which gives the advance of the latter ſix times too great: for this reaſon the concluſions of Dr. Price, and thoſe writers who never lay down that diſtinction when they treat of increaſing burthens, and the meaſure of their effect upon the national credit, muſt be erroneous.</p>
                  <p>The annual decrement of the value of money upon which this calculation and ſome which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low are founded, is I think aſſigned with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: the article in the table from which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it which advanced with the greateſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was corn: yet it ſeemed uniform through all the period obſerved, which points out a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent cauſe. Many might be eaſily inſtanced, that luxury introduced by the fortunes made in the laſt war, over and above the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0575401100:52"/>
of an increaſe of wealth; a change of the manner of life in the farmers who raiſe theſe commodities; who have in their own conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſubſtituted more expenſive articles, inſtead of the cheaper and ſimpler which formerly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them: and the fortunes made by many in a ſhort time, which have excited the avidity of almoſt all to grow rich in haſte: theſe if entered into at length would be found beſt to correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond to the effects obſerved. If the former years of the period (for which the regiſter of prices I have uſed was kept) were rather more plentiful than the latter, the exportation permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then tended on the other hand to raiſe thoſe prices, and the reſtraint in the latter to diminiſh them: and during thoſe years of greater plenty the advance was found moſt rapid: but that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance could not be owing to exportation only, or the ſame cauſe at any other period would have produced the ſame effect: nor would any thing but a deficiency in the productions of the earth increaſing every year, produce it, which can with no probability be ſuppoſed: it was out of the power of an uniform deficiency to have cauſed it: the price muſt have come to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt heigth in a ſhort time, and there remained
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0575401100:53"/>
fixed indeed, but not progreſſive.—But that the annual decrement of the value of money might be ſuſpected of no exaggeration, I have ſuppoſed the value of corn to have riſen only half the ſum the Nacton table points out, and from thence deduced the rate of decreaſe 2,16 per cent. annually.</p>
                  <p>If we had taken the fall of money 2,89 as exhibited in the table, the burthen of the taxes would have appeared diminiſhed 1/40, or 245,610 l. yearly: that of the peace eſtabliſhment 1/13, and that of the debt increaſed 1/10</p>
                  <p>The public annual charges are compounded of the intereſt of the debt added to the other current expences, which may deſerve to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſeparately. The debt at the beginning of of the laſt war was ſeventy-two millions, and ſuppoſing the intereſt paid the public creditors equal in both times, ſuch a burthen was equal to 108,2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0,000 at the end of 74. The public debt then amounted to 137 millions, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the national burthens in thoſe years was as 108 to 137, or as 1 to 1,266. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the burthen and actual ſum the ſame, would give this rate of increaſe as 1 to 1,903:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0575401100:54"/>
or the difference of burthen nearly 3,4 times too much.</p>
                  <p>If we deduct the intereſt of the debt from 5,964,283 l. the total taxes of 55, the remainder will be the peace eſtabliſhment together with the ſums applied to the diſcharge of the debt: the intereſt amounts to 2,565,000 l. admitting it to be proportional to that of the preſent debt; the difference applied to the purpoſes mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove amount to 3,399,283 l. which equalled in value 5,108,900 in 74: the remainder of the public revenue in 74 applied to theſe purpoſes after the diſcharge of the intereſt of the funded debt was 5,119,320, exceeding the former ſum 1/500 which gives the addition to the burthen. During the laſt peace we have annually paid off 916,666 l. of the debt, during the former 750,000, the difference is 166,666 l.</p>
                  <p>The expence of the peace eſtabliſhment has been loudly objected to: it appears however from the laſt conſideration to have been a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing burthen, though a much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force has been kept up by ſea and land than before the commencement of the laſt war.</p>
                  <p>The debt in 1715 was fifty-five millions, and nearly the ſame it is to be ſuppoſed at the peace
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0575401100:55"/>
of Utrecht. The national intereſt then was ſix per cent. the preſent debt 137, its intereſt 3½; and admitting both theſe ſums to be redeemable funded debts, the intereſt on each will be 3,300,000 l. and 4,795,000 l. if we calculate the value of money for 1715 from an average of ten years of which that is the middle term, we ſhall find a revenue of 3,300,000 at that period, equal in value to 4,699,000 in 1774. Our burthen therefore in thoſe forty-nine years is augmented barely 1/50; and we may in reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this ſubject ſuppoſe them perfectly equal.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to follow from this concluſion, that the total of all our national exertions ſince the peace of Utrecht, have been no more than equal to our abilities; becauſe our burthens have not been increaſed.</p>
                  <p>That there is no more reaſon to apprehend a national bankruptcy now, than there was at that period; and the fears which were then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, have been ſince refuted by experience.</p>
                  <p>It has been obſerved of late years that ſome of our funds have become more productive, the advantages reſulting to the nation from ſuch a circumſtance deſerve a little attention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0575401100:56"/>The proportion of the preſent value of the perpetuity of an encreaſing to a fixed fund, is as the rate of intereſt, to the difference between that and the advance—That of a decreaſing fund, as the intereſt to the ſum of the intereſt and rate of advance—And that of an increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a decreaſing fund, as that ſum to the difference mentioned above. An example will make this ſufficiently clear—Let there be three funds each of 100,000, the firſt increaſing 1½ per cent. annually, the ſecond fixed, the third decreaſing at the ſame rate the firſt increaſes; let 3½ be the rate of intereſt, the value of the increaſing fund will be to that which remains fixed as 3½ the rate of intereſt to 2 the difference of the advance and intereſt, or as 7 to 4: the real value of the firſt is five millions, the ſecond 2,857,142, and the difference 2,142,858—The value of the decreaſing to the fixed fund will be 3½ to 5, or 7 to 10, and the perpetuity of the third fund will be 2,000,000, the loſs 857,142; and the difference between the increaſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing fund 3½+1½, to 3½−1½, as 5 to 2.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the loſs upon five funds perpetually decreaſing at the rate of 1½ per cent is only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the gain upon two increaſing funds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0575401100:57"/>And let there be ſeven pariſhes aſſeſt at an equal ſum to the poors rate, let the charges of five annually decreaſe at 1½ per cent. and the remaining two increaſe at the ſame rate; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the former will be balanced by the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the latter.</p>
                  <p>After having ſaid ſo much on the relative meaſures of burthens, the next ſubject which naturally offers itſelf to our conſideration is its abſolute meaſure, or what every man pays in the pound in proportion to his conſumption of commodities.</p>
                  <p>There are no data I believe to determine this queſtion exactly, the utmoſt we can do is by a probable conjecture to approach near the truth.</p>
                  <p>A land tax of 4s. in the pound according to the aſſeſſments, was ſome years ago eſtimated to raiſe no more than 1s. 6d. of the rack rent: the rent of the kingdom will thus appear to amount to 23 millions; the product taken as three times the rent 69 millions; admit the additional value of our manufactures 2/7 of our whole production, the value of our manufactures will thus come out 27,600,000; and ſuppoſing ⅔ conſumed at home, that conſumption amounts to 18,400,000l. and our exports to 9,200,000. For which we
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0575401100:58"/>
import foreign commodities of which the value to the conſumer will be 10,120,000, reckoning 10 per cent. only for freight and mercantile pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; I have here ſuppoſed no balance of trade in our favour: our annual conſumption therefore appears to be 97,520,000 l. add 10 millions the ſum of the taxes, and the total expence of the kingdom is 10,752,000 a year, and the abſolute meaſure of the burthen <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of our total expence; ſomething leſs than 1..10½ in the pound. Mr. Maſſie in 1761 calculated the taxes paid by the farmer in proportion to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption at 1s. 10d. in the pound; upon what ground he formed his concluſion I do not know.</p>
                  <p>The intereſt of the debt being nearly half the taxes its burthen will be 11¼ in the pound. Mr. Hanway has endeavoured to compute the annual conſumption of the kingdom upon different principles; he begins his account with a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which can no ways be admitted, that the ordinary rent is twenty times the value of a land tax at one ſhilling in the pound, this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently gives the reſult far too little.</p>
                  <p>That the land annually produces on a medium four rents, I have ſuppoſed but three.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0575401100:59"/>That the other articles to be added are half the produce, exceeding the proportion aſſumed here as 5 to 4.</p>
                  <p>If he had ſuppoſed the rents to bear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon eſtimated proportion to the land tax, the conſumption of the kingdom would have come out 138 millions annually; the total expence of taxes and conſumption 148; the burthen 1/15, or more nearly 1s. 5d. in the pound.</p>

                  <p>Suppoſing the unreduced advance of prices drawn from the tables true, it appears that the price of proviſions and the money levied in taxes, have ſince the beginning of the laſt war advanced almoſt in equal degrees; it may be proper therefore to examine upon this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, whether the increaſe of the public expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have not raiſed the prices of proviſion, and thus created an apparent ability to ſupport them, at the expence of a much heavier evil.</p>

the price of neceſſaries will remain the ſame—Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine now by a deficiency of the productions of the earth, or any other cauſe, the quantity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in one ſingle year is reduced in a certain proportion, as for inſtance 1/39; it is evident the price of proviſions will riſe that year in ſome ſimilar proportion, not perhaps preciſely equal, ſuppoſe it 5 per cent. the next year upon the return of the old quantity they will fall again nearly to their original rate, which they will after a certain period acquire: if this period extend to five years (for the term is of no importance) and the decreaſe of price every year be equal, or that the addition to the firſt price ſhall be in the 1ſt year 5, the 2d 4, the 3d 3, the 4th 2, the 5th 1, the 6th 0, or return to its old level— let the quantity of proviſions to be diminiſhed again a ſecond year, the effect of the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt year will have left an advance of four upon the price, the preſent year increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es this with an additional advance of five, ſo that the total advance of the ſecond year will be nine; in like manner for the third year, the advance from the deficiency of the firſt will be three, the ſecond four, the total ſeven, and generally in the</p>

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">If we ſuppoſe theſe decrements continual proportionals inſtead of equal quantities, the numbers and ſums will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes of powers, the reſult the ſame, and the form of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration: but the arithmetical progreſſion will be more univerſally underſtood.</note> Here we ſee that the price of proviſion, by withdrawing every year 1/30 of the whole quantity, increaſes continually to the fifth year; but in the ſixth and ſeventh year, and ever after, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe is made; the effect is in that year come to a maximum.</p>
                  <p>And let the price of neceſſaries increaſe dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this period from any other cauſe acting in conjunction with this; as for inſtance the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the quantity of money, in the ſame number of years the effect of the annual dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of proviſion will be at its greateſt height, and at all ſubſequent periods, the rate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0575401100:62"/>
of price will go on in the ſame proportion as if it had been effected by the quantity of money alone.</p>
                  <p>If inſtead of commodities in kind their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative ſpecie had been ſubſtituted, its effect would have been the ſame, if the ſums taken had at the different times aſſigned, repreſented the ſame real value: for no reaſon can be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed why taking away the repreſentative ſhould produce a greater effect than taking away the real value repreſented by it.</p>
                  <p>When the proportion of neceſſaries thus taken or ſpecie repreſenting them uniformly increaſes, it continually tends to increaſe the price of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which then has no maximum. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the burthen of the poor rate has been 1,00616 for nine years laſt paſt; its efficacy to raiſe the price of proviſion has poſſibly been to that of all the other cauſes operating with it as 616 to 2,89, about ⅙ of the whole.</p>
                  <p>When the burthen decreaſes the prices of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion (if no other cauſes operate) decreaſe with it. If we admit the decrement of the value of money which the table gives to be true, the burthen of our annual taxes ſince the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laſt war has decreaſed 1/40; therefore
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0575401100:63"/>
                     <hi>a fortiori</hi> they have not been the cauſe of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement in the value of money.</p>
                  <p>If we reaſon from the reduced hypotheſis which gives the value of money 2,16, our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then being now no more than it was at the death of Queen Anne, the preſent difference of the price of proviſion compared with that of three or four years after, cannot be aſcribed to it: for if it had continued the ſame during the whole interval, it would have produced its utmoſt effect in three or four years after the peace of Utrecht; and the ſubſequent advances muſt have been attributed to ſome other cauſe.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſtriking difference between the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a debt with its annual intereſt levied upon the public, and a tax of the ſame amount applied to the current ſervice: for the two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual payments of the public ſimply as ſuch would produce the ſame effect upon the price of proviſion: but if there had been no fund to veſt the capital of the debt in, a great part of the money now compoſing it would have been laid out in the purchaſe of lands; this would have increaſed their price; to reimburſe himſelf this extraordinary expence, the new purchaſer raiſes his rents, and this raiſes the price of proviſion.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0575401100:64"/>
And the intereſt paid to foreigners again dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes its efficacy, being a diminution of the quantity of money in the kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But admitting the decrement of the value of money aſſigned too high, there is another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I think puts this beyond a doubt: a nation which funds inſtead of defraying the current expences of war and peace by immediate taxation, at firſt is eaſed of paying the principal, by only taking the burthen of the intereſt: as the debt increaſes this intereſt increaſes until it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as much as would have equalled the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage expence of war and peace if there had been no debt; its laſt ſtage is where the intereſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that average. During the firſt two peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods the ſum of all its taxes will have been much leſs than in the former ſyſtem, and therefore they will have produced an effect conſiderably leſs in raiſing the price of proviſions; we are now nearly in the ſecond of theſe periods as I ſhall have preſently occaſion to ſhew, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proviſions have hitherto been cheaper on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our funding.</p>
                  <p>Yet I am by no means inclined to extenuate the conſequences of a ſyſtem, which if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from in time, may ſtill for a certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0575401100:65"/>
continue to lighten our own burthens by the ruin of poſterity: but a general diſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from views which I conceive preſent our ſituation in too dark a point of light, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and even diſable us from making uſe of thoſe reſources which remain to us. Though the debt appears not to have been an increaſing burthen, funding may very well be conceived to be an ineligible mode of defraying the public expence. Let us therefore enquire into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent value of the difference of our ſyſtem of fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that of raiſing ſuch taxes uniformly ſince the beginning of laſt war, as would have compleatly diſcharged the ſums it was then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to borrow, at the end of that term of years for which we might reaſonably expect the continuance of peace. This ſum added to our peace eſtabliſhment will give us the amount of our taxes in caſe we had no debt, and enable us to determine the loſs of the kingdom by funding according to the preſent ſtate of that debt.</p>
                  <p>The proportion of the number of years of war to thoſe of peace ſince the commencement of the preſent century, has been as 7 to 12: the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the laſt war begun in the ſpring of 1756, and included ſeven years; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0575401100:66"/>
expectation of peace was twelve years. The debt contracted in the war was 76 millions, and ſuppoſing the annual grants all equal, the extraordinary expence amounted to 10,857,142l. per annum, an extraordinary revenue of 5,011,400, would have diſcharged that debt with its intereſt by the time another war would probably have commenced: we muſt add to this the peace eſtabliſhment for the army, navy, civil liſt, and the annual debt upon theſe articles amounting to 4,850,000l. and the whole reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue annually raiſed upon the public would thus amount to 9,861,400l. which falls ſhort of the preſent ſum raiſed by the taxes 139,600 l. about 1/70.</p>
                  <p>During the peace the debt has been dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to 65 millions, but to have diſcharged that ſum in the ſame term of time, 4,286,066l. a year muſt have been levied in additional taxes, or in the whole 14,016,746l.: in both theſe caſes we ſhould have begun the ſubſequent war with the ſame debt upon us we did the former, but the different ſums of money to be raiſed upon the people to bring us into the ſame ſituation would have been as 98 to 140, or as 7 to 10: which I think to be the difference of the real value to the kingdom in our preſent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0575401100:67"/>
between the ſyſtem of funding and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed above.</p>
                  <p>If the debt were annihilated it does not ſeem that we ſhould be able to reduce our taxes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the probability of being obliged to create a new one; becauſe the intereſt of the debt is very nearly equal the ſum we ſhould annually pay to prevent coming into that circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding, this points out the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of purſuing for a certain term of years the moſt efficacious methods of reducing the public debt: I therefore proceed to enquire into the means Dr. Price has recommended to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this.</p>
                  <p>He has ſuppoſed we may be able at leaſt to obtain of America a fund of 300,000 a year.</p>
                  <p>The colonies are ſaid to double their numbers in 25 years, but let us ſuppoſe the term 35 in which the quantity of land flung into cultivation is doubled. If a tax be laid upon the land already broken up, amounting to 300,000 per annum, which he ſeems upon the authority of Lord Shelburne to conſider as attainable, and all future grants be aſſeſt at half as much again for the ſame quantity of land; the rate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of cultivated land will be 2 1/35 or 1,219
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0575401100:68"/>
per hundred acres yearly; which would be the increaſe of the tax if the lands newly brought into cultivation were aſſeſt at the ſame rate with the old; but they are ſuppoſed to pay half as much again, or the tax to increaſe 1,8285 per cent yearly, and taking the intereſt of money at 3 1/2, and the debt at 137 million, it would be diſcharged in 70,3 years by that fund, and an annual burthen of 4,880,0<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0 annihilated, with a clear addition to the revenue at the end of that term of 1,066,530 l.</p>
                  <p>There is one particular property attending ſuch a mode of taxation, that all frauds at the original aſſeſſment, and thoſe which may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted afterwards, act contrary to and will near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy each others effect. A fixed ſum is to be paid; if the preſent poſſeſſor in his account delivered in diminiſh the quantity of land he holds, ſuch a diminution will augment the tax upon equal quantities, and the ſum will remain the ſame; but it will alſo augment the revenue from lands afterwards brought into cultivation in the proportion of 3 to 2: and if the future frauds in reſpect of quantity be equal to the paſt, the revenue will upon the whole gain; if they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0575401100:69"/>
exceed them in proportion of three to two, it will not loſe.</p>
                  <p>But beſide the tax from the colonies, which I ſuppoſe to remain as ſtated above, the following are ſome of the reſources which he points out as remaining to the nation for the diſcharge of the debt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The annual ſurplus of the revenue 300,000l.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The land tax to be continued at 4s. in the pound the amount of the additional ſhilling 450,000 nearly to be thus applied.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In 1781 there will be an addition to the annual ſaving of 189,863l.—18,986,300l. principal debt falling from 4 per cent. to 3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In 1782 a further addition of 22,500l.— 4,500,000l. more being reduced from 3½ to 3 per cent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In 18 years the greateſt part of 224,580l. per annum annuities will be extinguiſhed; as theſe will fall into the ſavings gradually, let us ſuppoſe them all to ſubſiſt together 12 years, and then at once to fall off. Then in 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>8 the fund will be further augmented 224580l.</p>
                  <p>Theſe funds conjointly will diſcharge the debt in <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> years, and if we further were to ſuppoſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0575401100:70"/>
the affairs of the Eaſt India Company ſo far retrieved, as to be able in two or three years to pay 300,000 a year to government, the debt will be diſcharged in 37 years nearly.</p>
                  <p>In determining this period I ſuppoſed the rate of intereſt 3¾ per cent. for the following reaſons; when a fund ſinks below par, as for inſtance to 90, it may be privately bought up; if it riſe above as to 110, the creditor will ſubmit to a reduction of 8 per cent. rather than be paid off at 100: theſe particulars have been fully point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by Dr. Price, I have therefore ſuppoſed their effect equal to ¼ per cent. added to the common rate of intereſt.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible perhaps to form any well-grounded hypotheſis of the future annual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of the value of money; but upon a ſuppoſition that it will be for the next 71 years ⅔ what the following table gives it for the term it comprehends, that our future wars ſhall have the ſame proportional length as the former in this century, and our operations be as extenſive as in the laſt, our new debt will be paid off in 30,88 years, the whole in 72, and the burthen continue nearly the ſame during the entire term of payment. But toward the latter end of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0575401100:71"/>
theſe periods, the diſcharge of the debt might be perhaps too much accelerated; and ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of money be flung into the hands of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic creditors, as muſt greatly and rapidly encreaſe the price of land and conſequently of proviſion; the effects this might produce upon commerce and induſtry merit ſome conſideration, there is a limit which the payment of the Britiſh creditors ought not to exceed; when it gets to that, it might perhaps be expedient with the overplus to begin to diſcharge the principal due to foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which therefore it would be right to reſerve 'till nearly the laſt; becauſe we might be obliged to ſtop in the courſe of payment earlier than we otherwiſe ſhould be neceſſitated to; nor ought even that in any period of its diſcharge to exceed a certain proportion of the balance of trade in our favour, it might otherwiſe deprive us of our ſpecie.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall cloſe theſe obſervations on the debt with a recapitulation of what has been endeavoured to be proved:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That the burthen of the taxes from 56 to 74 increaſed 11/100.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0575401100:72"/>II. That in reaſoning upon this ſubject if we conſider burthen and charge as ſynonimous terms, the increaſe reſulting will be ſix times too much.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That the increaſe of the burthen of the debt in the ſame period is only 266/1000, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſecond method of eſtimating it, it appears to be 903/1000, or 3,4 times too great.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That the peace eſtabliſhment has not been an increaſing burthen, notwithſtanding the ſuperior force kept up.</p>
                  <p>That the burthen of the annual ſum paid to the public creditors, was the ſame nearly at the peace of Utrecht as at preſent.</p>
                  <p>The burthen of paying off the debt with a given annuity at that period the intereſt 6 per cent. and that of the preſent the intereſt 3 ½ per cent. would be found not differing in a very great proportion: but to aſſign this, it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to go into a detail exceeding the limit which ſhould be allowed to a ſubject merely col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral.</p>
                  <p>That the gain by a fund which becomes annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more productive, greatly overbalances the loſs by a decreaſing fund.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0575401100:73"/>That the ſyſtem of funding has not yet raiſed the price of neceſſaries.</p>
                  <p>That the abſolute burthen of the taxes is 1s. 10½d in the pound, of the debt 11¼d: but that the difference between the preſent ſyſtem of funding, and impoſing ſuch taxes as might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably at the diſcharge the expence of one war by the commencement of the following, is as 10 to 7.</p>
                  <p>But that all fears of public bankruptcy, grounded upon a meaſure of public burthens, which does not take the decreaſe of the value of money into conſideration, appear for that reaſon ill founded.</p>
                  <p>That theſe concluſions may be compared and underſtood with more facility, I have digeſted them into the form of a table.</p>

               <p>Annual advance per cent. 2,89 for thirteen years the whole term; 3,63 for the firſt four years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0575401100:79"/>This annual advance is equal the annual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of the value of money.</p>
               <p>The numbers in the laſt article, ſundries, were found in the following manner; the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for 10 paupers in one year, from the beſt eſtimate of particular articles I could obtain, amounted to 15l. the rate of increaſe was then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed equal to ⅔ that of the other articles.</p>
               <p>But there is an apparent irregularity in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; an acceleration in the firſt period of ,74 per cent. the cauſe of this, and its preciſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure may very probably be aſſigned.</p>
               <p>We very eaſily diſcover two temporary cauſes of acceleration which then took place; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of taxes, and the fortunes made in the laſt war, and brought over from the Eaſt Indies. We will ſuppoſe the effect of the latter ⅗ that of the former: The annual average increaſe of the debt laſt war was about 11 millions, and in the middle of that period we are conſidering it was nearly 126 millions, and the annual increment of the burthen 11/126; we found the abſolute bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then when the debt was 137 millions to be 11¼ in the pound; at 126 it therefore was 10¼, and the increment in pence 112,75/126: admit with Dr. Price that ¼ more is raiſed upon the public for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0575401100:80"/>
commodities by the increaſe of taxes, than the ſum paid to government; the total increment of the price of proviſions will be 140,9375/126, or in the terms of a pound <gap reason="math">

                  </gap> for the acceleration of the increaſe of the price of proviſion = ,7457 per cent. but the mean advance by the table ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be 2,89, the accelerated advance 3,63, and the effect of the accelerating cauſe ,74 as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined above.</p>
               <p>To this it may be objected that it has been demonſtrated, that taking the decrement 2,89 the increaſe of taxes has not raiſed the price of proviſions in 19 years, but the reaſons alledged above not only admit that the taxes in ſome of the given years increaſe the prices of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, but even aſſign the quantity of that aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
               <p>The period mentioned was during the war, the operation of a tax newly laid on is to raiſe the price of neceſſaries, and conſequently to drop the value of money: during a war of ſeven years, if taxes increaſe in a ſuperior proportion to the fall of the value of money, the public
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0575401100:81"/>
burthen increaſes; if money continue to fall (as the table points it out) in every ſucceſſive year of peace the ſame tax will have leſs value, or become a leſs burthen than the former; and as there are twelve years of peace to ſeven years of war, the decrement of burthen in twelve years, taking the yearly rate 2, 89, will balance the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in ſeven.</p>
               <p>The numbers therefore corrected by removing theſe cauſes of perturbation would ſtand thus:

               <p>I muſt obſerve here, that the correction of the numbers, founded on a probable hypotheſis, is probably, but not perhaps mathematically true; there being no demonſtration of the aſſumption on which it is founded, it is certain however that ⅝ of the irregularity ought to be ſubtracted, if we allow no efficacy to the influx of money; but whatever be allowed will abate the remaining ⅜. There is the greateſt probability that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual decrement of the value of money has not been over-rated after the reduction I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0575401100:82"/>
it is much more probable that it falls ſhort of the true meaſure.</p>
               <p>Conſiderable uſes might (I ſhould be inclined to think) be derived from accurate tables kept in this manner.—Government has already or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered regiſters to be kept of the principle arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in it; if the others were likewiſe added, the buſineſs of granting relief to the poor, might be regulated upon ſuch fixed principles as to be always proportioned to the neceſſity of the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per applying for relief in every variation of prices: the quantities of the different neceſſaries of life to be conſumed in kind by a family of every probable number, may be found with very little difficulty; then the different expence of maintaining ten men for a year deduced as above may be given in the firſt column of a table, and in a line with every different charge (which need not exceed twelve in number) the weekly expence of a family of every different ſize: ſuch a table might be compriſed in one folio page and need no alteration for many years. The prices of many articles of proviſion are I believe delivered in at the quarter ſeſſions; a clerk might every half year draw out an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the charge of ſupporting ten men an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0575401100:83"/>
at the rates of the time being; it would be compleated in four or five ſhort multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The numbers in the line oppoſite the neareſt ſum in the table, would give the weekly expence of a family of every probable ſize: the the weekly earnings of the pauper ſubſtracted from this, will give the weekly allowance: proper diſcretionary additions may be made in caſe of ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>If the relief thus proper to be granted to a family of every ſize (tranſcribed from the general table) were publiſhed in the provincial papers at the ſame times, they would form a check upon either the avarice or profuſe folly of a pariſh officer.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly ſome very good conſequences might be derived from general abſtracts of the accounts of the different houſes of induſtry being yearly advertiſed in the county papers, with the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage expence of maintaining ten paupers for the laſt year, compared with the charge of the ſame number formed by the prices of that part of the country, as in the forgoing article. If ſuch an inſtitution by the negligence of the directors in general ſhould be ſuffered to fall into improper hands (of which I think there is no probable
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0575401100:84"/>
danger) this compariſon would be an account of their miſmanagement, the meaſure of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly defined, and their own accuſation to the public. The different expence of maintaining that number of paupers in different houſes would be eaſily compared, and the cauſe examined into by the director of that diſtrict whoſe charge amounted to the greater ſum: it would be a check upon the unneceſſary expence or illiberal parſimony of either, and all ſuch corporations be continually approaching to the beſt plan of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for their poor.</p>
               <p>It would render this new ſyſtem likewiſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being made more general: the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the abuſe of ſuch inſtitution ariſes from the want of a ſufficient number of directors, but diminiſhing the probability you make fewer directors neceſſary.</p>
               <p>We may thus likewiſe approach tolerably near the ſolution of a political difficulty of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; to regulate the price of labour by the ſtate; if ever it ſhould be found expedient to attempt ſuch a meaſure.</p>
               <p>The legiſlature may know at what mean price the public intereſt requires work of a certain kind to be fixed, but determine that price inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0575401100:85"/>
by ſtatute, and every labourer (let his ſtrength or ſkill be ever ſo different, as the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of neither can be defined) receives equal wages: as the value of money falls, there will be a neceſſity of frequently altering the ſtatute, or the labourers are reduced to the moſt abject diſtreſs: fixing labour of different kinds to rates which riſe and fall by the prices of proviſions deduced from a table formed in the manner I have given, would take away the latter objection, but leaves the firſt. To remedy that, when a ſervant was hired for a certain period, the ſum fixed by agreement might be conſidered as a rate or proportion; and the payment ſhould increaſe or decreaſe with the variations of the value of money. A ſhort annual table might be given before Michaelmas for the whole kingdom, which would contain every variation of rate, or the juſtices of the peace for the ſeparate counties might draw up one at the preceding ſeſſions, as the prices of the different counties are not perfectly equal. It is eaſy to ſee that there would never be occaſion for any alteration of the rate of hireing—That the labourer would be paid according to his abilities and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his maſter for his ſervices—That he would always receive the real value in proportion to the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0575401100:86"/>
terms of his agreement, inſtead of a nominal ſum— Wages always bearing nearly the ſame proportion to the price of proviſions, equal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would generally procure an equal quantity at every price; which would tend to diminiſh popular inſurrections.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the price of labour to be now a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of years behind the price of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as four or five; every other circumſtance is eaſily deduced from that point of time when fixed: but there certainly is ſome delicacy requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in fixing it.</p>
               <p>I had occaſion to conſider before in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, the effect of a land tax in a country not fully ſettled, but where population and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment advanced with great rapidity. If far the greater part or the whole of the revenue a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try draws from its colonies were by ſuch a tax, the rate of which was made fixed and permanent, it would give greater ſecurity to the coloniſt for the peaceable enjoyment of the reſt of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, than ſucceſſive taxes impoſed at various times to make up the ſame amount. There certainly is no injuſtice in ſubjecting a future age to bear the ſame burthens, and contribute the ſame real value to the parent ſtate their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors did; if the abſolute taxation for equal
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0575401100:87"/>
quantities of land varied every ten years, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the variation of the value of money in the colony for the preceding term, deduced from a table of this kind, the burthen of an individual would at the moſt diſtant period of time always be in proportion to his ability, and be equal upon equal property. The money produced by it would increaſe in a complicate proportion of the increaſe of the ſettlement, and the riſe of proviſions; this augmentation would continue after ſuch a ſettlement was fully peopled, in proportion as they applied themſelves to arts and commerce. For a people ſtrong by ſea, without numerous land forces, large iſlands, but ſuch as are not capable of ſupporting above 600,000 inhabitants, ſeem the beſt ſettlements. If leſs, their people will ſoon ceaſe to increaſe, and the ſettlement be entirely cultivated; and perhaps there is a vigour of character, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of refinement attainable in a middling ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety which ſmaller one's are not capable of: if they be larger, it may be difficult to reſtrain them in the bounds of a proper ſubordination, and they have this further recommendation, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to have ſeparated them, and prevented all temptations to a dirty detail of inſidious left

                  <p>The loſs to an individual from a ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney taken from him a given number of years ſince, is equal to its preſent amount at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound intereſt.</p>
                  <p>The whole uſe and benefit to an individual of equal ſums, for equal times, are equal: and his loſs by being deprived of them is equal. Let a man be ſuppoſed to have paid a given ſum (for inſtance 100l) ten years ſince to any rate or tax; he has loſt the uſe and benefit of 100 pounds for the term of ten years paſt, and for
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0575401100:97"/>
ever after—Let him at the ſame time have laid aſide 100l. to increaſe at compound intereſt to this period at four per cent. this ſum will have amounted to 148l. at the end of the term: if then this ſum be taken from him by a ſecond rate or taxation, what is it he loſes? the uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of 100l. for the paſt term of ten years, and for ever after. But his loſs in the firſt caſe is equal to that in the ſecond, or equal to a preſent loſs of the amount of the ſum for the given term at compound intereſt.</p>
                  <p>What has been demonſtrated of one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual paying a certain ſum, holds true of any ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate body of individuals paying any ſums.</p>
                  <p>And for ſimilar reaſons the loſs to an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual in being obliged to pay a given ſum, at the end of a given term of years, is leſs than if he had been compelled to pay it immediately.</p>
                  <p>This will be readily admitted in the caſes of two kinds of people, thoſe who put out money at intereſt, becauſe their income exceeds their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, or who borrow for the contrary reaſon; but are the intermediate claſs who neither hoard nor borrow affected the ſame way?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0575401100:98"/>If the intereſt of the ſum taken away be ſmall in proportion to ſuch a man's income, ſuppoſe 1/500 part, it may become imperceptible but is nevertheleſs real: for if poſſible ſuppoſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that it was abſolutely nothing; then it would be nothing if multiplied indefinitely, or fifty times for inſtance: but an accumulation of ſuch nothings as cut off 1/10 part of a man's income who did not ſave before, would be found a real difference.</p>
                  <p>Some concluſions upon a queſtion of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence having been lately drawn from principles contrary to theſe, it will not perhaps be thought unneceſſary to have given this demonſtration of them at length before the following calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
