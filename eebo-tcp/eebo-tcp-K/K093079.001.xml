            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IN an age like the preſent, wherein literary merit of every kind ſo much abounds, and is at the ſame time ſo much encouraged; many poetical performances which deſerve a longer remembrance than fugitive pieces uſually meet with, are daily thrown upon the public, and left to periſh in oblivion. To ſelect theſe from the trifling productions of the day, has ever been conſidered as an uſeful employment: and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable reception which Mr. DODSLEY's ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Collection of Poems obtained from the public, is ſufficient to encourage any perſon who has the means in his power to continue that deſervedly eſteemed Miſcellany. Several at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of this ſort have been made, but none have acquired ſo much reputation as to render the preſent undertaking uſeleſs or unneceſſary.
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0376600101:4"/>
Twelve years are now elapſed ſince the laſt volumes of that work were publiſhed, in which time it is not to be ſuppoſed that there has been ſo great a dearth of genius, but that many pieces have made their appearance which are not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the beſt preſerved in that Miſcellany. Of the truth of this obſervation, the Editor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the following Collection, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled from the beſt productions publiſhed within that time, which Mr. DODSLEY had not the opportunity of ſeeing, with the addition of many other pieces, which with all his diligence were overlooked by him. With what degree of judgment this Collection is made, the Editor ſubmits to the determination of the public; the greater part of the poetical pieces of the laſt thirty years have paſſed through his hands, and as of them the following Volumes are compoſed, he hopes they will not be conſidered as in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Supplement to the work of which they are deſigned as a Continuation. He flatters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he has not ſuffered private friendſhip to obtrude any piece into this Collection, which is unworthy of the reſt, and great care has been
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0376600101:5"/>
taken to prevent the inſertion of any performance which has not been approved by gentlemen of diſtinguiſhed reputation; but as he is ſenſible that the taſte of perſons is very different, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects not after all that every piece will meet with equal applauſe, being convinced of the truth of Mr. DODSLEY's obſervation, <q rend="inline">"That it is impoſſible to furniſh out an entertainment of this nature, where every part ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by every gueſt."</q>

               <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>Abelard and Eloiſa flouriſhed in the twelfth century; they were two of the moſt diſtinguiſhed perſons of their age in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate paſſion. After a long courſe of calamities they retired each to a ſeveral convent, and conſecrated the remainder of their days to religion. It was many years after this ſeparation, that a letter of Abelard to a friend, which contained the hiſtory of his misfortunes, fell into the hands of Eloiſa: this occaſioned thoſe celebrated letters (out of which the following is partly extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) which give ſo lively a picture of the ſtruggles of grace and nature, virtue and paſſion.</p>

But when, by ſome accident, they are ſet on fire, they then produce dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſions, very deſtructive to the miners; and burſting out of the pits with great impetuoſity, like the fiery eruptions from burning mountains, force along with them ponderous bodies to a great height in the air.</note>,</l>

By ſuch fires, ſeveral collieries have been intirely deſtroyed; of which there are inſtances near Newcaſtle, and in other parts of England, and in the ſhire of Fife in Scotland; in ſome of which places, the fire has continued burning for ages.

Theſe breaks, the miners call Dykes; and when they come at one of them, their firſt care is to diſcover whether the ſtarta in the part adjoining be higher or lower than in the part where they have been working: or, (to uſe their own terms) whether the coal be caſt down, or caſt up. If it be caſt down, they ſink a pit to it; but if it be caſt up to any conſiderable height, they are often-times obliged, with great labour and expence, as at the place here deſcribed, to carry forwards a level or long gallery through the rock, until they again arrive at the ſtratum of coal.</note>, the miner's way to cloſe,</l>

                        <hi>While pent within the iron womb,</hi> &amp;c.] The author hath here taken occaſion to celebrate the fire-engine, the invention of which does ſuch honour to this nation. He has endeavoured to deſcribe, in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etic manner, the effects of the elaſtic ſteam, and the great power of the atmoſphere; which, by their alternate actions, give force and motion to the beam of this engine, and by it, to the pump-rods, which elevate the water through tubes, and diſcharge it out of the mine. It appears, from pretty exact calculations, that it would require about 550 men, or a power equal to that of 110 horſes, to work the pumps of one of the largeſt fire-engines now in uſe, (the diameter of whoſe cylinder is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty inches) and thrice that number of men to keep an engine of this ſize conſtantly at work. And that as much water may be raiſed by an engine of this ſize kept conſtantly at work, as can be drawn up by 2520 men with rollers and buckets, after the manner now daily practiſed in many mines; or as much as can be borne up on the ſhoulders of twice that number of men; as is ſaid to be done in ſome of the mines of Peru.—So great is the power of the air in one of thoſe engines.</p>
                     <p>There are four fire-engines belonging to this colliery; which, when all at work, diſcharge from it about 1228 gallons every minute, at thirteen ſtrokes; 1,768,320 gallons every twenty-four hours. By the four engines here employed, nearly twice the above-mentioned quantity of water might be diſcharged from mines that are not above ſixty or ſeventy fathoms deep, which depth is rarely exceeded in the Newcaſtle collieries, or in any of the Engliſh collieries, thoſe of Whitehaven ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                     <p>The reader may find an account of Savery's engine in Harris's Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con Technicum.—Many great improvements have been made to it ſince, and are daily making; ſeveral of which are related in the Philoſophical Tranſactions. The beſt account of it, its various improvement and uſes, is, I think, in Dr. Deſaguliers's courſe of experimental philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, vol. 11.</p>

                        <hi>Sweet Keſwick's vale,</hi> &amp;c.] This delightful vale is thus elegantly deſcribed by the late ingenious Dr. Brown in a letter to a friend. <q rend="inline">"In my way to the north from Hagley, I paſſed through Dovedale; and, to ſay the truth, was diſappointed in it. When I came to Buxton, I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited another or two of their romantic ſcenes; but theſe are inferior to Dovedale. They are all but poor miniatures of Keſwick; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds them more in grandeur than I can give you to imagine; and more, if poſſible, in beauty than in grandeur.<p>"Inſtead of the narrow ſlip of valley which is ſeen at Dovedale, you have at Keſwick a vaſt amphitheatre, in circumference above twenty miles. Inſtead of a meagre rivulet, a noble living lake, ten miles round, of an oblong form, adorned with a variety of wooded iſlands. The rocks indeed of Dovedale are finely wild, pointed, and irregular; but the hilis are both little and unanimated; and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds, moraſs, and bruſhwood. But at Keſwick, you will, on one ſide of the lake, ſee a rich and beautiful landſkip of cultivated fields, riſing to the eye in fine inequalities, with noble groves of oak, happily diſperſed; and climbing the adjacent hills, ſhade above ſhade, in the moſt various and pictureſque forms. On the oppoſite ſhore, you will find rocks and cliffs of ſtupendous height, hanging broken over the like in horrible grandeur, ſome of them a thouſand feet high, the woods climbing up their ſteep and ſhaggy ſides, where mortal foot never yet approached: on theſe dreadful heights the eagles build their neſts; a variety of water-falls are ſeen pouring from their ſummits, and tumbling in vaſt ſheets from rock to rock in rude and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible magnificence: while on all ſides of this immenſe amphitheatre the lofty mountains riſe round, piercing the clouds in ſhapes as ſpiry and fantaſtic as the very rocks of Dovedale. To this I muſt add the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble bays and promontories: in other parts they finely retire from it, and often open in abrupt chaſms or clefts, through which at hand you ſee rich and uncultivated vales, and beyond theſe, at various diſtance, mountain riſing over mountain; among which, new proſpects preſent themſelves in miſt, till the eye is loſt in an agreeable perplexity.</p>
                           <q>
                              <l>Where active fancy travels beyond ſenſe,</l>
                              <l>And pictures things unſeen.—</l>
                           </q>
                           <p>Were I to analyſe the two places into their conſtituent principles, I ſhould tell you, that the full perfection of Keſwick conſiſts of three cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, beauty, horror, and immenſity united; the ſecond of which alone is found in Dovedale. Of beauty it hath little; nature having left it almoſt a deſert: neither its ſmall extent, nor the diminutive and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs form of the hills, admit magnificence; but to give you a complete idea of theſe three perfections, as they are joined in Keſwick, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Pouſſin. The firſt ſhould throw his delicate ſunſhine over the cultivated vales, the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered cots, the groves, the lake, and wooded iſlands. The ſecond ſhould daſh out the horror of the rugged cliffs, the ſteeps, the hanging woods, and foaming water-falls; while the grand pencil of Pouſſin ſhould crown the whole with the majeſty of the impending mountains.</p>
                           <p>"So much, for what I would call the permanent beauties of this aſtoniſhing ſeene. Were I not afraid of being tireſome, I could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties. I would ſail round the lake, anchor in every bay, and land you on every promontory and iſland. I would point out the perpetual change of proſpect: the woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by turns vaniſhing or riſing into view: now gaining on the ſight, hanging over our heads in their full dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, beautifully dreadful; and now, by a change of ſituation, aſſuming new romantic ſhapes, retiring and leſſening on the eye, and inſenſibly loſing themſelves in an azure miſt. I would remark the contraſt of light and ſhade, produced by the morning and evening ſun; the one gilding the weſtern, the other the eaſtern ſide of this immenſe amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre; while the vaſt ſhadow projected by the mountains buries the oppoſite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate: the natural variety of colouring which the ſeveral objects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce is no leſs wonderful and pleaſing: the ruling tincts in the valley being thoſe of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various, ariſing from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the graſs, and corn-fields: theſe are finely contraſted by the grey rocks and cliffs; and the whole heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by the yellow ſtreams of light, the purple hues, and miſty azure of the mountains. Sometimes a ſerene air and clear ſky diſcloſe the tops of the higheſt hills: at others, you ſee the clouds involving their ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, reſting on their ſides, or deſcending to their baſe, and rolling among the vallies, as in a vaſt furnace; when the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder; then, too, the clouds are ſeen in vaſt bodies ſweeping along the hills in gloomy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while the lake joins the tumult, and toſſes like a ſea: but in calm weather the whole ſcene becomes new: the lake is a perfect mirror; and the landſkip in all its beauty: iſlands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are ſeen inverted, and floating on its ſurface. I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where, if you dare approach the ridge, a new ſcene of aſtoniſhment preſents itſelf; where the valley, lake, and iſlands, ſeem lying at your feet; where this expanſe of water ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears diminiſhed to a little pool amidſt the vaſt and immeaſurable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that ſurround it; for here the ſummits of more diſtant hills appear beyond thoſe you have already ſeen; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <l>My lays unpractis'd, pour into my verſe</l>
               <l>The flow harmonious, while th' enchanted Muſe</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Diffuſive Nature, who with liberal hand</l>
               <l>Scatters her bounties round, and decks the Spring</l>
               <l>In all its gay attire, the Virgin's cheek</l>
               <l>Fluſhes with beauty, and adorns her brow</l>
               <l>With charms attractive; ſhapes her faultleſs form</l>
               <l>With ſkill unerring, on her breaſt beſtows</l>
               <l>The ſnowy hue, while o'er her ſhining neck</l>
               <l>In wanton ringlets flows her ebon hair</l>

Diſhevell'd, graceful, and her ſparkling eyes</l>
               <l>Dart kindling flame: majeſtic on ſhe moves,</l>
               <l>Conſcious of native worth, and ſmiling love</l>
               <l>Alluring. Hither, ye! whoſe hard'ned hearts</l>
               <l>Ne'er felt a lover's pangs, ah! hither come,</l>
               <l>To feel the force of Beauty: here ſurvey,</l>
               <l>In radiant luſtre, the bewitching grace,</l>
               <l>Which from the dawn of time o'er Nature held</l>
               <l>Her ſoft domain. Since firſt the vital ſpark</l>
               <l>Awak'd the human breaſt, and Man aroſe</l>
               <l>To conſcious being, the fair female form</l>
               <l>Dazzled his eye, and thro' his panting breaſt</l>
               <l>Shot Beauty's ray. When in primaeval Spring</l>
               <l>Life uncorrupted roll'd its golden hours,</l>
               <l>Free from th' attacks of Vice, as yet unſour'd</l>
               <l>With Pain corroding; nor Diſeaſe had rear'd</l>
               <l>Her ſnaky creſt to blaſt their blooming days:</l>
               <l>Then Beauty reign'd, and form'd the ſacred tye</l>

               <l>The blood fierce-boiling flows, ſubduing Love</l>
               <l>Still reigns in man, to poliſh and refine</l>
               <l>His barbarous mind: nor, till the ſoothing flame</l>

When in each fair and fertile field</l>

               <l>Refreſhment o'er my ſoothed ſenſe;</l>

Ruſtle the breezes lightly borne</l>
               <l>Or deep-embattled ears of corn:</l>
               <l>Round ancient elm with humming noiſe,</l>
