            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN HISTORY OF BIRDS.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. Of Birds in General.</head>
               <p>WE are now come to a beautiful and loqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious race of animals,
that embelliſh our foreſts, amuſe our walks, and exclude ſolitude from
our moſt ſhady retirements. From theſe man has nothing to fear; their
pleaſures, their deſires, and even their animoſities, only ſerve to
enliven the general picture of Nature, and give har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to meditation.</p>
               <p>No part of Nature appears deſtitute of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The
woods, the waters, the depths of the earth, have their reſpective tenants;
while the yielding air, and thoſe tracts of ſeeming ſpace where man never
can aſcend, are alſo <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0823900105:5"/> paſſed through by multitudes of
the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful beings of the creation.</p>
               <p>Every order and rank of animals ſeems fitted for its
ſituation in life; but none more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently than birds; they ſhare in
common with the ſtronger race of quadrupedes the vegetable ſpoils of the
earth, are ſupplied with ſwiftneſs to compenſate for their want of
force; and have a faculty of aſcending into the air to avoid that power which
they cannot oppoſe.</p>
               <p>The bird ſeems formed entirely for a life of eſcape; and
every part of the anatomy of the animal ſeems calculated for ſwiftneſs.
As it is deſigned to riſe upon air, all its parts are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
light, and expand a large ſurface without ſolidity.</p>
               <p>In a comparative view with man, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſeems much
ruder and more imperfect; and they are in general found incapable of the
docility even of quadrupedes. Indeed, what great degree of ſagacity can be
expected in animals whoſe eyes are almoſt as large as their brain? However,
though they fall below qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes in the ſcale of Nature, and are leſs
imitative of human endowments; yet they hold the next rank, and far ſurpaſs
fiſhes and inſects, both in the ſtructure of their bodies and in their
ſagacity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0823900105:6"/>As in mechanics the moſt curious
inſtruments are generally the moſt complicated, ſo it is in anatomy. The
body of man preſents the greateſt variety upon diſſection; quadrupedes,
leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly formed, diſcover their defects in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of
their conformation; the mechaniſm of birds is ſtill leſs complex;
fiſhes are furniſhed with fewer organs ſtill; whilſt inſects, more
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect than all, ſeem to fill up the chaſm that ſeparates animal from
vegetable nature. Of man, the moſt perfect animal, there are but three or
four ſpecies; of quadrupedes, the kinds are more numerous; birds are more
various ſtill; fiſhes yet more; but inſects afford ſo very great a
variety, that they elude the ſearch of the moſt inquiſitive
purſuer.</p>
               <p>Quadrupedes, as was ſaid, have ſome diſtant reſemblance
in their internal ſtructure with man; but that of birds is entirely
diſſimilar. As they ſeem chiefly formed to inhabit the empty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of
air, all their parts are adapted to their deſtined ſituation. It will be
proper therefore, before I give a general hiſtory of birds, to enter into a
ſlight detail of their anatom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
               <p>As to their external parts, they ſeem ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly adapted
for ſwiftneſs of motion. The ſhape of their body is ſharp before, to
pierce and make <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0823900105:7"/> way through the air; it then riſes by a
gentle ſwelling to its bulk, and falls off in an expanſive tail, that helps
to keep it buoyant, while the fore-parts are cleaving the air by their
ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. From this conformation, they have often been compared to a
ſhip making its way through water; the trunk of the body anſwers to the
hold, the head to the prow, the tail to the rudder, and the wings to the oars;
from whence the poets have adopted the metaphor of <hi>remigium alarum,</hi>
when they deſcribe the wavy motion of a bird in flight.</p>
               <p>What we are called upon next to admire in the external formation
of birds is, the neat po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the feathers, lying all one way,
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering at once the purpoſes of warmth, ſpeed, and ſecurity. They
moſtly tend backward, and are laid over one another in an exact and regular
order, armed with warm and ſoft down next the body, and more ſtrongly
fortified and curiouſly cloſed externally, to fence off the injuries of the
weather. But, leſt the feathers ſhould ſpoil by their violent attrition
againſt the air, or imbibe the moiſture of the atmoſphere, the animal is
furniſhed with a gland behind, containing a proper quantity of oil, which can
be preſſed out by the bird's bill, and laid ſmoothly over every feather
that wants to be dreſſed for the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0823900105:8"/> occaſion. This gland
is ſituated on the rump, and furniſhed with an opening or excretory duct;
about which grows a ſmall tuft of feathers, ſomewhat like a painter's
pencil. When, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the feathers are ſhattered or rumpled, the bird,
turning its head backwards, with the bill catches hold of the gland, and,
preſſing it, forces out the oily ſubſtance, with which it anoints the
disjoined parts of the feathers; and, drawing them out with great
aſſiduity, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and places them in due order; by which they unite
more cloſely together. Such poultry, however, as live for the moſt part
under cover, are not furniſhed with ſo large a ſtock of this fluid as
thoſe birds that reſide in the open air. The feathers of an hen, for
inſtance, are pervious to every ſhower; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſwans, geeſe,
ducks, and all ſuch as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has directed to live upon the water, have
their feathers dreſſed with oil from the very firſt day of their leaving
the ſhell. Thus their ſtock of fluid is equal to the neceſſity of its
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Their very fleſh contracts a flavour from it, which renders
it in ſome ſo very rancid, as to make it utterly unfit for food; however,
though it injures the fleſh, it improves the feathers for all the domeſtic
purpoſes to which they are uſually converted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0823900105:9"/>Nor are the feathers with which birds are
covered leſs an object of admiration. The ſhaft of every feather is made
proportionably ſtrong; but hollow below for ſtrength and lightneſs, and
above filled with a pith to feed the growth of vane or beard that ſprings
from the ſhaft of the feather on either ſide. All theſe feathers are
placed generally according to their length and ſtrength, ſo that the
largeſt and ſtrongeſt feathers in flight have the greateſt ſhare of
duty. The vane, or beard of the feather, is formed with equal contrivance and
care. It conſiſts not of one continued membrane; becauſe, if this were
broken, it could not eaſily be repaired; but it is compoſed of many layers,
each ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in itſelf reſembling a feather, and lying againſt each
other in cloſe conjunction. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhaft of the feather, theſe
layers are broad, and of a ſemicircular form, to ſerve for ſtrength, and
for the cloſer grafting them one againſt another when in action. Towards
the outer part of the vane, theſe layers grow ſlender and taper to be more
light. On their under ſide they are thin and ſmooth, but their upper outer
edge is parted into two hairy edges, each ſide having a different ſort of
hairs, broad at bottom, and ſlender and bearded above. By this mechaniſm,
the hooked beards of one layer <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0823900105:10"/> always lye next the
ſtraight beards of the next, and by that means lock and hold each other.</p>
               <p>The next object that comes under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in
contemplating an animal that flies, is the wing, the inſtrument by which this
wonderful progreſſion is performed. In ſuch birds as fly, they are
uſually placed at that part of the body which ſerves to poize the whole,
and ſupport it in a fluid that at firſt ſeems ſo much lighter than
itſelf. They anſwer to the fore-legs in quadrupedes, and at the extremity
of this they have a certain finger-like appendix, which is uſually called the
<hi>baſtard-wing.</hi> This inſtrument of flight is furniſhed with
quills, which differ from the common feathers only in their ſize being
larger, and alſo from their ſpringing from the deeper part of the ſkin,
their ſhafts lying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cloſe to the bone. The beards of theſe
quills are broad on one ſide and more narrow on the other, both which
contribute to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive motion of the bird and the cloſeneſs of
the wing. The manner in which moſt birds avail themſelves of theſe is
firſt thus: they quit the earth with a bound, in order to have room for
flapping with the wing; when they have room for this, they ſtrike the body of
air beneath the wing with a violent motion, and with the whole under ſurface
of the ſame; but <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0823900105:11"/> then, to avoid ſtriking the air with
equal vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the upper ſide as they riſe, the wing is inſtantly
contracted; ſo that the animal riſes by the impulſe till it ſpreads the
wing for a ſecond blow. For this reaſon, we always ſee birds chuſe to
riſe againſt the wind, becauſe they have thus a greater body of air on
the under than the upper ſide of the wing. For theſe reaſons alſo large
fowls do not riſe eaſily, both becauſe they have not ſufficient room at
firſt for the motion of their wings, and becauſe the body of air does not
lie ſo directly under the wing as they riſe.</p>
               <p>In order to move the wings, all birds are furniſhed with two
very ſtrong pectoral muſcles, which lie on each ſide of the
breaſt-bone. The pectoral muſcles of quadrupedes are trifling in
compariſon to thoſe of birds. In quadrupedes, as well as in man, the
muſcles which move the thighs and hinder parts of the body are by far the
ſtrongeſt, while thoſe of the arms are feeble; but in birds, which make
uſe of their wings, the contrary obtains; the pectoral muſcles that move
the wings or arms are of enormous ſtrength, while thoſe of the thighs are
weak and ſlender. By means of theſe, a bird can move its wings with a
degree of ſtrength which, when compared to the animal's ſize, is 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0823900105:12"/> almoſt incredible. The flap of a ſwan's wing would
break a man's leg; and a ſimilar blow from an eagle has been known to lay a
man dead in an inſtant. Such, conſequently, is the force of the wing, and
ſuch its lightneſs, as to be inimitable by art. No machines that human
ſkill can contrive are capable of giving ſuch force to ſo light an
apparatus. The art of flying, therefore, that has ſo often and ſo
fruitleſsly been ſought after, muſt, it is feared, for ever be
unattainable; ſince as man encreaſes the force of his flying machine, he
muſt be obliged to encreaſe its weight alſo.</p>
               <p>In all birds, except nocturnal ones, the head is ſmaller, and
bears leſs proportion to the body than in quadrupedes, that it may more
readily divide the air in flying, and make way for the body, ſo as to render
its paſſage more eaſy. Their eyes alſo are more flat and depreſſed
than in quadrupedes; a circle of ſmall plates of bone, placed ſcalewiſe,
under the outer coat of the organ, encompaſſes the pupil on each, to
ſtrengthen and defend it from injuries. Beſide this, birds have a kind of
ſkin, called the nictitating membrane, with which, like a veil, they can at
pleaſure cover their eyes, though their eyelids continue open. This membrane
takes its riſe from the greater or <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0823900105:13"/> more obtuſe corner
of the eye, and ſerves to wipe, cleanſe, and probably to moiſten its
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. The eyes, though they outwardly appear but ſmall, yet
ſeparately, each almoſt equals the brain; whereas in man the brain is more
than twenty times larger than the orbit of the eye. Nor is this organ in birds
leſs adapted for viſion by a particular expanſion of the optic nerve,
which renders the impreſſions of external objects more vivid and
diſtinct.</p>
               <p>From this conformation of the eye it follows, that the ſenſe
of ſeeing in birds is infinitely ſuperior to that of other animals. Indeed,
this piercing ſight ſeems neceſſary to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's ſupport and
ſafety. Were this organ blunter, from the rapidity of the bird's motion, it
would be apt to ſtrike againſt every object in its way; and it could
ſcarcely find ſubſiſtence unleſs poſſeſſed of a power to
diſcern its food from above with aſtoniſhing ſagacity. An hawk, for
inſtance, perceives a lark at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which neither men nor dogs could
ſpy; a kite, from an almoſt imperceptible height in the clouds, darts down
on its prey with the moſt unerring aim. The ſight of birds, therefore,
exceeds what we know in moſt other animals, and excels them both in
ſtrength and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0823900105:14"/>All birds want the external ear ſtanding
out from the head; they are only furniſhed with holes that convey ſounds to
the auditory ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. It is true, indeed, that the horned owl, and one or two
more birds, ſeem to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ears; but what bears that reſemblance
are only feathers ſticking out on each ſide of the head, but no way
neceſſary to the ſenſe of hearing. It is probable, however, that the
feathers encompaſſing the ear-holes in birds ſupply the defect of the
exterior ear, and collect ſounds to be tranſmitted to the internal
ſenſory. The extreme delicacy of this organ is eaſily proved by the
readineſs with which birds learn tunes, or repeat words, and the great
exactneſs of their pronunciation.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe of ſmelling ſeems not leſs vivid in the
generality of birds. Many of them <hi>wind</hi> their prey at an immenſe
diſtance, while others are equally protected by this ſenſe againſt
their inſidious purſuers. In decoys, where ducks are caught, the men who
attend them univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally keep a piece of turf burning near their mouths, upon
which they breathe, leſt the fowl ſhould ſmell them, and conſequently
fly away. The univerſality of this practice puts the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it
beyond a doubt, and proves the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme delicacy of the ſenſe of
ſmelling, at leaſt in this ſpecies of the feathered creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0823900105:15"/>Next to the parts for flight, let us view
the legs and feet miniſtring to motion. They are both made light for the
eaſier tranſportation through the air. The toes in ſome are webbed, to
fit them for the waters; in others they are ſeparate, for the better holding
objects, or clinging to trees for ſafety. Such as have long legs have alſo
long necks, as otherwiſe they would be incapable of gathering up their food,
either by land or water. But it does not hold, however, that thoſe who have
long necks ſhould have long legs, ſince we ſee that ſwans and geeſe,
whoſe necks are extremely long, have very ſhort legs, and theſe chiefly
employed in ſwimming.</p>
               <p>Thus every external part hitherto noticed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears adapted to
the life and ſituation of the animal; nor are the inward parts, though leſs
immediately appropriated to flight, leſs neceſſary to ſafety. The bones
of every part of the body are extremely light and thin; and all the muſcles,
except that immediately moving the wings, extremely ſlight and feeble. The
tail, which is compoſed of quill feathers, ſerves to counterbalance the
head and neck, it guides the animal's flight like a rudder, and greatly
aſſiſts it either in its aſcent or when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0823900105:16"/>If we go on to examine birds internally, we
ſhall find the ſame wonderful conformation fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them for a life in air,
and encreaſing the ſurface by diminiſhing the ſolidity. In the firſt
place, their lungs, which are commonly called the ſole, ſtick faſt to the
ſides of the ribs and back, and can be very little diluted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.
But to make up for this, which might impede their breathing, the ends of the
branches of the wind-pipe open into them, while theſe have openings into the
cavity of the belly, and convey the air drawn in by breathing into certain
receptacles like bladders, running along the length of the whole body. Nor are
theſe openings obſcure, or difficult to be diſcerned; for a probe
thruſt into the lungs of a fowl will eaſily find a paſſage into the
belly; and air blown into the wind-pipe will be ſeen to diſtend the
animal's body like a bladder. In quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes this paſſage is ſtopped by
the midriff; but in fowls the communication is obvious; and conſequently they
have a much greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of taking a long and large inſpiration. It is
ſometimes alſo ſeen that the wind-pipe makes many convolutions within the
body of the bird, and it is then called the labyrinth; but of what uſe
theſe convolutions are, or why the wind-pipe ſhould make ſo many turnings
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0823900105:17"/> within the body of ſome birds, is a difficulty for which
no naturaliſt has been able to account.</p>
               <p>This difference of the wind-pipe often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in animals that
to all appearance are of the ſame ſpecies. Thus in the tame ſwan, the
wind-pipe makes but a ſtraight paſſage into the lungs; while in the wild
ſwan, which to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal appearance ſeems the ſame animal, the
wind-pipe pierces through the breaſt-bone, and there has ſeveral turnings,
before it comes out again and goes to enter the lungs. It is not to form the
voice that theſe turnings are found, ſince the fowls that are without them
are vocal; and thoſe, particularly the bird juſt now mentioned, that have
them, are ſilent. Whence therefore, ſome birds derive that loud and various
modulation in their warblings is not eaſily to be accounted for; at leaſt,
the knife of the anatomiſt goes but a ſhort way in the inveſtigation. All
we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of, is, that birds have much louder voices, in reſpect to
their bulk, than animals of any other kind; for the bellowing of an ox is not
louder than the ſcream of a peacock.</p>
               <p>In theſe particulars, birds pretty much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble each other
in their internal conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but there are ſome varieties which we
ſhould more attentively obſerve. All birds have, properly ſpeaking, but
one ſtomach; <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0823900105:18"/> but this is very different in different
kinds. In all the rapacious kinds that live upon animal food, as well as in
ſome of the fiſh-feeding tribe, the ſtomach is peculiarly formed. The
oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus, or gullet, in them is found replete with glandulous bodies,
which ſerves to dilate and macerate the food as it paſſes into the
ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which is always very large in proportion to the ſize of the bird,
and generally wrapped round with fat, in order to encreaſe its warmth and
powers of digeſtion.</p>
               <p>Granivorous birds, or ſuch as live upon fruits, corn, and
other vegetables, have their inteſtines differently formed from thoſe of
the rapacious kind. Their gullet dilates juſt above the breaſt-bone, and
forms itſelf into a pouch or bag, called the crop. This is replete with
ſalivary glands, which ſerve to moiſten and ſoften the grain and other
food which it contains. Theſe glands are very numerous, with longitudinal
openings, which emit a whitiſh and a viſcous ſubſtance. After the dry
food of the bird has been macerated for a convenient time, it then paſſes
into the belly, where, inſtead of a ſoft moiſt ſtomach, as in the
rapacious kinds, it is ground between two pair of muſcles, commonly called
the gizzard, covered on the inſide with a ſtony ridgy coat, and almoſt
cartilaginous. <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0823900105:19"/> Theſe coats, rubbing againſt each
other, are capable of bruiſing and attenuating the hardeſt ſubſtances,
their action being often compared to that of the grinding-teeth in man and
other animals. Thus the organs of digeſtion are in a manner reverſed in
birds. Beaſts grind their food with their teeth, and then it paſſes into
the ſtomach, where it is ſoftened and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. On the contrary, birds
of this ſort firſt macerate and ſoften it in the crop, and then it it is
ground and comminuted in the ſtomach or gizzard. Birds are alſo careful to
pick up ſand, gravel, and other hard ſubſtances, not to grind their food,
as has been ſuppoſed, but to prevent the too violent action of the coats of
the ſtomach againſt each other.</p>
               <p>Moſt birds have two appendices or blind guts, which in
quadrupedes are always found ſingle. Among ſuch birds as are thus
ſupplied, all carnivorous fowl, and all birds of the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row kind, have
very ſmall and ſhort ones: water-fowl, and birds of the poultry kind, the
longeſt of all. There is ſtill another appendix obſervable in the
inteſtines of birds, reſembling a little worm, which is nothing more than
the remainder of that paſſage by which the yolk was conveyed into the guts
of the young chicken, while yet in the egg and under incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0823900105:20"/>The outlet of that duct which conveys the
bile into the inteſtines is, in moſt birds, a great way diſtant from the
ſtomach; which may ariſe from the danger there would be of the bile
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitating into the ſtomach in their various rapid motions, as we ſee
in men at ſea; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their biliary duct is ſo contrived, that this
regurgitation cannot take place.</p>
               <p>All birds, though they want a bladder for urine, have large
kidneys and ureters, by which this ſecretion is made, and carried away by one
common canal. 
<q rend="inline">"Birds," ſays Harvey, "as well as ſerpents,
which have ſpongy lungs, make but little water, becauſe they drink but
little. They, therefore, have no need of a bladder; but their urine diſtils
down into the common canal, deſigned for receiving the other excrements of
the body. The urine of birds differs from that of other animals; for, as there
is uſually in urine two parts, one more ſerous and liquid, the other more
thick and groſs, which ſubſides to the bottom; in birds, this part is
moſt abundant, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the reſt by its white or
ſilver colour. This part is found not only in the whole inteſtinal canal,
but is ſeen alſo in the whole channel of the ureters, which may be
diſtinguiſhed from the coats of the kidneys <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0823900105:21"/> by their
whiteneſs. This milky ſubſtance they have in greater plenty than the more
thin and ſerous part; and it is of a middle conſiſtence, between limpid
urine and the groſſer parts of the faeces. In paſſing through the
ureters, it reſembles milk curdled or lightly condenſed; and, being caſt
forth eaſily, congeals into a chalky cruſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this ſimple conformation of the animal, it ſhould
ſeem that birds are ſubject to few diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; and, in fact, they have
but few. There is one, however, which they are ſubject to, from which
quadrupedes are in a great meaſure exempt: this is the annual molting which
they ſuffer; for all birds whatſoever obtain a new covering of feathers
once a year, and caſt the old. During the molting ſeaſon, they ever
appear diſordered; thoſe moſt remarkable for their courage then loſe
all their fierceneſs; and ſuch as are of a weakly conſtitution often
expire under this natural operation. No feeding can maintain their ſtrength;
they all ceaſe to breed at this ſeaſon; that nouriſhment which goes to
the production of the young is wholly abſorbed by the demand required for
ſupplying the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent plumage.</p>
               <p>This molting time, however, may be arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially accelerated;
and thoſe who have the <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0823900105:22"/> management of ſinging birds
frequently put their ſecret in practice. They encloſe the bird in a dark
cage, where they keep it exceſſively warm, and throw the poor little animal
into an artificial fever; this produces the molt; his old feathers fall before
their time, and a new ſet take place, more brilliant and beautiful than the
former. They add, that it mends the bird's ſinging, and encreaſes its
vivacity; but it muſt not be concealed, that ſcarce one bird in three
ſurvives the operation.</p>
               <p>The manner in which Nature performs this operation of molting is
thus: the quill or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when firſt protruded from the ſkin and come to
its full ſize, grows harder as it grows older, and receives a kind of
perioſteum or ſkin round the ſhaft by which it ſeems attached to the
animal. In proportion as the quill grows older, its ſides, or the bony pen
part, thicken; but its whole diameter ſhrinks and decreaſes. Thus, by the
thickening of its ſides, all nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from the body becomes more
ſparing; and, by the decreaſe of its diameter, it becomes more looſely
fixed in its ſocket, till at length it falls out. In the mean time, the
rudiments of an incipient quill are beginning below. The ſkin forms itſelf
into a little bag, which is fed <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0823900105:23"/> from the body by a ſmall
vein and artery, and which every day encreaſes in ſize till it is
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded. While the one end vegetates into the beard or vane of the feather,
that part attached to the ſkin is ſtill ſoft, and receives a conſtant
ſupply of nouriſhment, which is diffuſed through the body of the quill by
that little light ſubſtance which we always find within when we make a pen.
This ſubſtance, which as yet has received no name that I know of, ſerves
the growing quill as the umbilical artery does an infant in the womb, by
ſupplying it with nouriſhment, and diffuſing that nouriſhment over the
whole frame. When, however, the quill is come to its full growth, and requires
no further nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, the vein and artery become leſs and leſs, till
at laſt the little opening by which they communicated with the quill becomes
wholly obliterated; and the quill thus deprived con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in its ſocket for
ſome months, till in the end it ſhrinks, and leaves room for a repetition
of the ſame proceſs of nature as before.</p>
               <p>The molting ſeaſon commonly obtains from the end of ſummer
to the middle of autumn. The bird continues to ſtruggle with this malady
during the winter, and Nature has kindly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that when there are the
feweſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0823900105:24"/> that then the animal's appetite
ſhall be leaſt craving. At the beginning of ſpring, when food begins
again to be plenty, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's ſtrength and vigour return. It is then that
the abundance of proviſions, aided by the mildneſs of the ſeaſon,
incite it to love, and all Nature ſeems teeming with life, and diſpoſed
to continue it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Generation, Neſtling and Incubation of
Birds.</head>
               <p>THE return of ſpring is the beginning of pleaſure. Thoſe
vital ſpirits which ſeemed locked up during the winter, then begin to
expand; vegetables and inſects ſupply abundance of food; and the bird
having more than a ſufficiency for its own ſubſiſtence, is impelled to
transfuſe life as well as to maintain it. Thoſe warblings which had been
huſhed during the colder ſeaſons, now begin to animate the fields; every
grove and buſh reſounds with the challenge of anger, or the call of
allurement. This delightful concert of the grove, which is ſo much admired by
man, is no way ſtudied for his amuſement: it is uſually the call of the
male to the female; his efforts to ſooth her during the times of incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation:
or it is a challenge between two males, for the affections of ſome common
favourite.</p>
               <p>It is by this call that birds begin to pair at the approach of
ſpring, and provide for the ſupport of a future progeny. The loudeſt
notes are uſually from the male; while the hen ſeldom expreſſes her
conſent, but in a ſhort, interrupted <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0823900105:26"/> twittering. This
compact, at leaſt for the ſeaſon, holds with unbroken faith: many birds
live with inviolable fidelity together for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; and when one dies,
the other is always ſeen to ſhare the ſame fate ſoon after. We muſt
not take our idea of the conjugal fidelity of birds from obſerving the
poultry in our yards, whoſe freedom is abridged, and whoſe manners are
totally corrupted by ſlavery. We muſt look for it in our fields and our
foreſts, where nature continues in unadulterated ſimplicity; where the
number of males is generally equal to that of females; and where every little
animal ſeems prouder of his progeny than pleaſed with his mate. Were it
poſſible to compare ſenſations, the male of all wild birds ſeems as
happy in the young brood as the female; and all his former careſſes, all
his ſoothing melodies, ſeem only aimed at that important occaſion when
they are both to become parents, and to educate a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny of their own
producing. The pleaſures of love appear dull in their effects, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the interval immediately after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of their young. They both
ſeem, at that ſeaſon, tranſported with pleaſure; every action
teſtifies their pride, their importance, and tender ſolicitude.</p>
               <p>When the buſineſs of fecundation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0823900105:27"/> the female then begins to lay. Such eggs as have been
impregnated by the cock are prolific; and ſuch as have not (for ſhe lays
often without any congreſs whatſoever) continue bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and are only
addled by incubation. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, however, to laying, the work of neſtling
becomes the common care; and this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with no ſmall degree of
aſſiduity and apparent deſign. It has been aſſerted, that birds of
one kind always make their neſts in the ſame manner, and of the ſame
materials; but the truth is, that they vary this as the materials, places, or
climates happen to differ. The red-breaſt, in ſome parts of England, makes
its neſt with oak leaves, where they are in greateſt plenty; in other parts
with moſs and hair. Some birds, that with us make a very warm neſt, are
leſs ſolicitous in the tropical climates, where the heat of the weather
promotes the buſineſs of incubation. In general, however, every ſpecies
of birds has a peculiar archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture of its own; and this adapted to the
number of eggs, the temperature of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, or the reſpective heat of
the little animal's own body. Where the eggs are numerous, it is then incumbent
to make the neſt warm, that the animal heat may be equally diffuſed to them
all. Thus the wren, and all the ſmall birds, <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0823900105:28"/> make the
neſt very warm; for having many eggs, it is requiſite to diſtribute
warmth to them in common: on the contrary, the plover, that has but two eggs,
the eagle, and the crow, are not ſo ſolicitous in this reſpect, as their
bodies are capable of being applied to the ſmall number upon which they
ſit. With regard to climate, water-fowl, that with us make but a very
ſlovenly neſt, are much more exact in this particular, in the colder
regions of the north. They there take every precaution to make it warm; and
ſome kinds ſtrip the down from their breaſts, to line it with greater
ſecurity.</p>
               <p>In general, however, every bird reſorts to hatch in thoſe
climates and places where its food is found in greateſt plenty; and always at
that ſeaſon when proviſions are in the greateſt abundance. The large
birds, and thoſe of the aquatic kinds, chuſe places as remote from man as
poſſible, as their food is in general different from that which is
cultivated by human labour. Some birds, which have only the ſerpent to fear,
build their neſts depending from the end of a ſmall bough, and form the
entrance from below; being thus ſecured either from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or the
monkey tribes. But all the little birds which live upon fruits and corn, and
that are too often unwelcome intruders upon the <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0823900105:29"/> fruits of
human induſtry, in making their neſts, uſe every precaution to conceal
them from man. On the other hand, the great birds, remote from human ſociety,
uſe every precaution to render theirs inacceſſible to wild beaſts or
vermin.</p>
               <p>Nothing can exceed the patience of birds while hatching; neither
the calls of hunger, nor the near approach of danger, can drive them from the
neſt. They are often fat upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to ſit, yet before incubation is
over, the female is uſually waſted to ſkin and bone. Ravens and crows,
while the females are ſitting, take care to provide them with food; and this
in great abundance. But it is different with moſt of the ſmaller kinds:
during the whole time the male ſits near his mate upon ſome tree, and
ſooths her by his ſinging; and often when ſhe is tired takes her place,
and patiently continues upon the neſt till ſhe returns. Sometimes, however,
the eggs acquire a degree of heat too much for the purpoſes of hatching: in
ſuch caſes, the hen leaves them to cool a little; and then returns to
ſit, with her uſual perſeverance and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>So great is the power of inſtinct, in animals of this claſs,
that they ſeem driven from one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to another, and continue almoſt
paſſive under its influence. Reaſon we cannot call it, 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0823900105:30"/> ſince the firſt dictates of that principle would be
ſelf-preſervation: 
<q rend="inline">"Take a brute," ſays Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, "out of his
inſtinct, and you find him wholly deprived of underſtanding. With what
caution," continues he, "does the hen provide herſelf a neſt in places
unfrequented, and free from noiſe and diſturbance! When ſhe has laid her
eggs in ſuch a manner that ſhe can cover them, what care does ſhe take in
turning them frequently, that all parts may partake of the vital warmth! When
ſhe leaves them to provide for her neceſſary ſuſtenance, how
punctually does ſhe return before they have time to cool, and become
incapable of producing an animal! In the ſummer you ſee her giving
herſelf greater freedoms, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her care for above two hours
together: but in winter, when the rigour of the ſeaſon would chill the
principles of life, and deſtroy the young one, ſhe grows more aſſiduous
in her attendance, and ſtays away but half the time. When the birth
approaches, with how much nicety and attention does ſhe help the chick to
break the priſon! not to take notice of her covering it from the injuries of
the weather, providing it with proper nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and teaching it to help
itſelf; nor to mention her forſaking the neſt, if, after the 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0823900105:31"/> uſual time of reckoning, the young one does not make its
appearance. A chymical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not be followed with greater art or
diligence than is ſeen in the hatching a chick, though there are many birds
that ſhew an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater ſagacity: yet at the ſame time the hen,
that has all this ſeeming ingenuity, (which is indeed abſolutely
neceſſary for the propagation of the ſpecies) conſidered in other
reſpects, is without the leaſt glimmerings of thought or common ſenſe:
ſhe miſtakes a piece of chalk for an egg, and ſits upon it in the ſame
manner; ſhe is inſenſible of any encreaſe or diminution in the number
of thoſe ſhe lays; ſhe does not diſtinguiſh between her own, and
thoſe of another ſpecies; and when the birth appears of never ſo
different a bird, will cheriſh it for her own. An hen followed by a brood of
ducks, ſhall ſtand affrighted at the edge of the pond, trembling for the
fate of her young, which ſhe ſees venturing into ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an
element. As the different principle which acts in theſe different animals
cannot be termed reaſon, ſo when we call it inſtinct, we mean ſomething
we have no knowledge of. It appears to me the immediate direction of
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and ſuch an operation of the Supreme Being as that which
determines all the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of matter to their proper centers."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0823900105:32"/>The production of the young, as was ſaid,
ſeems to be the great aera of a bird's happineſs. Nothing can at that time
exceed its ſpirit and induſtry: the moſt timid becomes courageous in the
defence of its young. Birds of the rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious kind, at this ſeaſon, become
more than uſually fierce and active. They carry their prey, yet throbbing
with life, to the neſt, and early accuſtom their young to habits of
ſlaughter and cruelty. Nor are thoſe of milder natures leſs buſily
employed; the little birds then diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their ſinging, taken up with
more import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant purſuits of common ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>While the young are yet unfledged, and continue in the neſt,
the old ones take care to provide them with a regular ſupply; and, leſt one
ſhould take all nouriſhment from the reſt, they feed each of the young in
their turn. If they perceive that man has been buſy with their neſt, or has
handled the little ones, they abandon the place by night, and provide their
brood a more ſecure, though leſs commodious retreat. When the whole family
is fully plumed, and capable of avoiding danger by flight, they are then led
forth when the weather is fine, and taught the paternal art of providing for
their ſubſiſtence. They are led to the places where their food lies; they
are ſhewn the method of <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0823900105:33"/> diſcovering or carrying it
away; and then led back to the neſt, for a day or two longer. At length, when
they are completely qualified to ſhift for themſelves, the old ones take
them abroad, and leading them to the accuſtomed places, forſake them for
the laſt time; and all future connexion is ever at an end.</p>
               <p>Thoſe birds which are hatched and ſent out earlieſt in the
ſeaſon are the moſt ſtrong and vigorous; thoſe, on the other hand,
that have been delayed till the midſt of ſummer, are more feeble and
tender, and ſometimes incapable of ſuſtaining the rigours of the
enſuing winter. Birds themſelves ſeem ſenſible of this difference,
and endeavour to produce early in the ſpring. If, however, their efforts are
obſtructed by having their neſts robbed, or ſome ſimilar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
they ſtill perſevere in their efforts for a progeny; and it often happens
that ſome are thus retarded till the midſt of winter. What number of eggs
any bird can lay in the courſe of a ſeaſon is not aſcertained; but this
is true, that ſuch as would have laid but two or three at the moſt, if
their neſts be robbed, or their eggs ſtolen, will lay above ten or twelve.
A common hen, if moderately fed, will lay above an hundred from the beginning
of ſpring to the latter end of autumn. In general, however, it 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0823900105:34"/> obtains, that the ſmalleſt and weakeſt animals are
the moſt prolific, while the ſtrong and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious are abridged by
ſterility. Thus, ſuch kinds as are eaſily deſtroyed, are as readily
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; and Nature, where ſhe has denied the power of reſiſtance, has
compenſated by the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility attending procreation.</p>
               <p>Birds in general, though they have ſo much to fear from man
and each other, are ſeldom ſcared away from their uſual haunts. Although
they be ſo perfectly formed for a wandering life, and are ſupplied with
powers to ſatisfy all their appetites, though never ſo remote from the
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, though they are ſo well fitted for changing place with eaſe and
rapidity, yet the greateſt number remain contented in the diſtricts where
they have been bred, and by no means exert their deſires in proportion to
their endowments. The rook, if undiſturbed, never deſires to leave his
native grove; the black-bird ſtill frequents its accuſtomed hedge; and the
red-breaſt, though ſeemingly mild, claims a certain diſtrict, from whence
he ſeldom moves, but drives out every one of the ſame ſpecies from thence
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pity. They are excited to migration by no other motives but thoſe of
fear, climate, or hunger. It muſt be from one of theſe powerful motives
that the birds, which are called birds of <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0823900105:35"/> paſſage,
every year forſake us for ſome time, and make their regular and expected
returns.</p>
               <p>Nothing has more employed the curioſity of mankind than
theſe annual emigrations; and yet few ſubjects continue ſo much involved
in darkneſs. It is generally believed, that the cauſe of their retreat from
theſe parts of Europe is either a ſcarcity of food at certain ſeaſons,
or the want of a ſecure aſylum from the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of man during the
time of courtſhip and bringing up their young. Thus the ſtarling, in
Sweden, at the approach of winter, finding ſubſiſtence no longer in that
kingdom, deſcends every year into Germany; and the hen chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finches of the
ſame country are ſeen every year to fly through Holland in large flocks, to
paſs their winter in a milder climate. Others, with a more daring ſpirit,
prepare for journies that might intimidate even human perſeverance. Thus the
quails in ſpring forſake the burning heats of Africa for the milder ſun
of Europe; and, when they have paſſed the ſummer with us, ſteer their
ſlight back to enjoy in Egypt the temperate air, which then begins to be
delightful. This with them ſeems a preconcerted under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. They unite
together in ſome open place, for ſome days before their departure, and, by
an odd kind of chattering, ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0823900105:36"/> on the method
to proceed. When their plan is reſolved upon, they all take flight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and often appear in ſuch numbers, that, to mariners at ſea, they ſeem
like a cloud that reſts upon the horizon. The boldeſt, ſtrongeſt, and
by far the greateſt number, make good their intention; but many there are
who, not well apprized of their own force for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, grow weary in
the way and, quite ſpent by the fatigues of their flight, drop down into the
ſea, and ſometimes upon deck, thus becoming an eaſy prey to the
mariner.</p>
               <p>Of the vaſt quantity of water-fowl that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent our
ſhores, it is amazing to reflect how few are known to breed here. The cauſe
that principally urges them to leave this country ſeems to be not merely the
want of food, but the deſire of a ſecure retreat. Our country is too
populous for birds ſo ſhy and timid as the greateſt number of theſe
are. When great part of our iſland was a mere waſte, an uncultivated tract
of woods and marſhes, many ſpecies of birds which now migrate remained with
us throughout the year. The great heron and the crane, that have now forſaken
this country, in former times bred familiarly in our marſhes, and ſeemed to
animate our fens. Their neſts, like thoſe of moſt cloven-footed
water-fowl, were <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0823900105:37"/> built on the ground, and expoſed to
every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader. But as rural oeconomy encreaſed, theſe animals were more
and more diſturbed. Before they had little to fear, as the ſurrounding
marſh defended them from all the carnivorous quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes, and their own
ſtrength from birds of prey; but upon the intruſion of man, and by a long
ſeries of alarms, they have at length been obliged to ſeek, during the
ſummer, ſome lonely habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, at a ſafe diſtance from every
deſtroyer.</p>
               <p>Of the numerous tribes of the duck kind, we know of no more than
five that breed here; the tame ſwan, the tame gooſe, the ſheldrake, the
eider duck, and a few of the wild ducks. The reſt contribute to form that
amazing mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of water-fowl which annually repair to the dreary lakes and
deſarts of Lapland from the more ſouthern countries of Europe. In thoſe
extenſive and ſolitary retreats, they perform the duties of incubation and
nutrition in full ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. There are few of this kind that may not be
traced to the northern deſerts, to countries of lakes, rivers, ſwamps, and
mountains, covered with thick and gloomy foreſts, that afford ſhelter
during ſummer to the timid animals, who live there in undiſturbed
ſecurity. In thoſe regions, from the thickneſs of the foreſts, the
ground remains moiſt and penetrable during the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0823900105:38"/>
ſeaſon; the woodcock, the ſnipe, and other ſlender billed birds, can
there feed at eaſe; while the web-footed birds find more than ſufficient
plenty of food from the number of inſects, which ſwarm there to an
incredible degree. The days there are long; and the beautiful meteorous nights
afford them every opportunity of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſo minute a food, which is
probably of all others the moſt grateful. We are not to be aſtoniſhed,
therefore, at the amazing numbers of fowl that deſcend from theſe regions
at the approach of winter; numbers to which the army of Xerxes was but trifling
in compariſon; and which Linnaeus has obſerved for eight whole days and
nights to cover the ſurface of the river Calix.</p>
               <p>This migration from the north uſually begins in September,
when they quit their retreats, and diſperſe themſelves over all the
ſouthern parts of Europe. It is not unpleaſing to obſerve the order of
their flight; they generally range themſelves in a long line, or they
ſometimes make their march angularly, two lines uniting in the center like
the letter V reverſed. The bird which leads at the point ſeems to cleave
the air, to facilitate the paſſage for thoſe which are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. When
fatigued with this laborious ſtation, it falls back into one of the wings of
the file, <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0823900105:39"/> while another takes its place. With us they make
their appearance about the beginning of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, circulate firſt round our
ſhores, and, when compelled by ſevere froſt, betake themſelves to our
lakes and rivers. Some, indeed, of the web-footed fowl, of hardier
conſtitutions than the reſt, abide the rigours of their northern climate
the whole winter; but when the cold reigns there with more than uſual
ſeverity, they are obliged to ſeek for more ſouthern ſkies. They then
repair with the reſt for ſhelter to theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; ſo that the diver,
the wild ſwan, and the ſwallow-tailed ſheldrake, viſit our coaſts but
ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that only when compelled by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of their winters at
home.</p>
               <p>It has been often a ſubject of aſtoniſhment, how animals
to all appearance ſo dull and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſhould perform ſuch long
journeys, ſhould know whither to ſteer, and when to ſet out upon ſuch a
great undertaking. It is probable that the ſame inſtinct which governs all
their other actions operates alſo here. They rather follow the weather than
the country; they ſteer only from colder or warmer climates into thoſe of
an oppoſite nature; and, finding the variations of the air as they proceed in
their favour, go on till they find land to repoſe on. It cannot be
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they have any memory of the country <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0823900105:40"/>
where they might have ſpent a former winter; it cannot be ſuppoſed that
they ſee the country to which they travel from their height in the air;
ſince, though they mounted for miles, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity of the globe would
intercept their view; it muſt therefore only be, that they go on as they
continue to perceive the atmoſphere more ſuitable to their preſent wants
and diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>All this ſeems to be pretty plain; but there is a
circumſtance attending the migration of ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows which wraps this
ſubject in great obſcurity. It is agreed on all hands, that they are ſeen
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grating into warmer climates, and that in amazing numbers, at the approach
of the European win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Their return into Europe is alſo as well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
about the beginning of ſummer; but we have another account, which ſerves to
prove that numbers of them continue torpid here during the winter; and, like
bats, make their retreat into old walls, the hollow of trees, or even ſink
into the deepeſt lakes, and find ſecurity for the winter ſeaſon, by
remaining there in cluſters at the bottom. However this latter circumſtance
may be, their retreat into old walls is too well authenticated to remain a
doubt at preſent. The difficulty, therefore, is to account for this
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in theſe animals thus variouſly preparing to encounter the
winter. It was ſuppoſed that <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0823900105:41"/> in ſome of them the
blood might loſe its motion by the cold, and that thus they were rendered
torpid by the ſeverity of the ſeaſon; but Mr. Buffon having placed many
of this tribe in an ice-houſe, found that the ſame cold by which their
blood was congealed was fatal to the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; it remains, therefore, a doubt to
this hour whether there may not be a ſpecies of ſwallows, to all external
appearance like the reſt, but differently formed within, ſo as to fit them
for a ſtate of inſenſibility during the winter here. It was
ſuggeſted, indeed, that the ſwallows found thus torpid were ſuch only
as were too weak to undertake the migration, or were hatched too late to join
the general convoy; but it was upon theſe that Mr. Buffon tried his
experiment; it was theſe that died under the operation.</p>
               <p>Thus there are ſome birds which by migrating make an
habitation of every part of the earth; but in general every climate has birds
peculiar to itſelf. The feathered inhabitants of the temperate zone are but
little remarkable for the beauty of their plumage; but then the ſmaller kinds
make up for this defect by the melody of their voices. The birds of the torrid
zone are very bright and vivid in their colours; but they have ſcreaming
voices, or are totally ſilent. The frigid zone, on the other hand, where the 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0823900105:42"/> ſeas abound with fiſh, are ſtocked with birds of the
aquatic kind, in much greater plenty than in Europe; and theſe are generally
cloathed with a warmer coat of feathers; or they have large quantities of fat
lying underneath the ſkin, which ſerves to defend them from the rigours of
the climate.</p>
               <p>In all countries, however, birds are a more long-lived claſs
of animals than the quadrupedes or inſects of the ſame climate. The life of
man himſelf is but ſhort, when compared to what ſome of them enjoy. It is
ſaid that ſwans have been known to live three hundred years: geeſe are
often ſeen to live fourſcore; while linnets, and other little birds, though
impriſoned in cages, are often found to reach fourteen or fifteen. How birds,
whoſe age of perfection is much more early than that of quadrupedes, ſhould
yet live comparatively ſo much longer, is not eaſily to be accounted for:
perhaps, as their bones are lighter, and more porous than thoſe of
quadrupedes, there are fewer obſtructions in the animal machine; and Nature,
thus finding more room for the operations of life, it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to a
greater extent.</p>
               <p>All birds in general are leſs than quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes; that is, the
greateſt of one claſs far ſurpaſs the greateſt of the other in
magnitude <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0823900105:43"/> The oſtrich, which is the greateſt of birds,
bears no proportion to the elephant; and the ſmalleſt humming-bird, which
is the leaſt of the claſs, is ſtill far more minute than the mouſe. In
theſe the extremities of Nature are plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernible; and in forming
them ſhe appears to have been doubtful in her operations: the oſtrich,
ſeemingly covered with hair, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of flight, making near approaches
to the quadrupede claſs; while the humming-bird, of the ſize of an
humble-bee, and with a flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering motion, ſeems nearly allied to the
inſect.</p>
               <p>Theſe extremities of this claſs are rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of human
curioſity than utility: it is the middle order of birds which man has taken
care to propagate and maintain. Of thoſe which he has taken under his
protection, and which adminiſter to his pleaſures or neceſſities, the
greateſt number ſeem creatures of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The variety of climate to
which he conſigns them, the food with which he ſupplies them, and the
purpoſes for which he employs them, produce amazing varieties, both in their
colours, ſhape, magnitude, and the taſte of their fleſh. Wild birds are,
for the moſt part, of the ſame magnitude and ſhape; they ſtill keep the
prints of primaeval nature ſtrong upon them: except in a few they generally
maintain <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0823900105:44"/> their very colour: but it is otherwiſe with
do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic animals; they change at the will of man—of the tame pigeon,
for inſtance, it is ſaid that they can be bred to a feather.</p>
               <p>As we are thus capable of influencing their form and colour,
ſo alſo is it frequent to ſee equal inſtances of our influencing their
habitudes, appetites and paſſions. The cock, for inſtance, is
artificially formed into that courage and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity which he is ſeen to
poſſeſs; and many birds teſtify a ſtrong attachment to the hand that
feeds them: how far they are capable of inſtruction, is manifeſt to thoſe
who have the care of hawks. But a ſtill more ſurprizing inſtance of this,
was ſeen ſome time ago in London: a canary bird was taught to pick up the
letters of the alphabet, at the word of command, ſo as to ſpell any
perſon's name in company; and this the little animal did by motions from its
maſter, which were imperceptible to every other ſpectator. Upon the whole,
however, they are inferior to quadrupedes in docility; and ſeem more
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically impelled by all the power of inſtinct.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the Diviſion of Birds.</head>
               <p>THOUGH birds are fitted for ſporting in air, yet as they find
their food upon the ſurface of the earth, there ſeems a variety equal to
the different aliments with which it tends to ſupply them. The flat and
burning deſart, the rocky cliff, the extenſive fen, the ſtormy ocean, as
well as the pleaſing landſcape, have all their peculiar inhabitants. The
moſt obvious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction therefore of birds, is into thoſe that live by
land, and thoſe that live by water; or, in other words, into <hi>land
birds,</hi> and <hi>water fowl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no difficult matter to diſtinguiſh land from water
fowl, by the legs and toes. All land birds have their toes divided, without any
mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane or web between them; and their legs and feet ſerve them for the
purpoſes of running, graſping, or climbing. On the other hand, water fowl
have their legs and feet formed for the purpoſes of wading in water, or
ſwimming on its ſurface. In thoſe that wade, the legs are uſually long
and naked; in thoſe that ſwim, the toes are webbed together, as we ſee in
the feet of a gooſe, which ſerve, like oars, to drive <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0823900105:46"/>
them forward with greater velocity. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, therefore, of land and
water fowl, is as diſtinct as their habits; and Nature herſelf ſeems to
offer us this obvious diſtribution, in methodizing animals of the feathered
creation.</p>
               <p>However, a diſtinction ſo comprehenſive goes but a ſhort
way in illuſtrating the different tribes of ſo numerous a claſs. The
number of birds already known, amounts to above eight hundred; and every
perſon who turns his mind to theſe kinds of purſuits, is every day adding
to the catalogue. It is not enough, therefore, to be able to diſtinguiſh a
land from a water fowl; much more is ſtill required: to be able to
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the different kinds of birds from each other; and even the
varieties in the ſame kind, when they happen to offer. This certainly is a
work of great difficulty; and perhaps the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment will not repay the
labour. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part of mankind will not withdraw all their attention
from more important purſuits, to give it entirely up to what promiſes to
repay them only with a very confined ſpecies of amuſement. In my
diſtribution of birds, therefore, I will follow Linnaeus in the firſt
ſketch of his ſyſtem; and then leave him, to follow the moſt natural
diſtinctions, in enumerating the different kinds that admit of an hiſtory,
or require a deſcription<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0823900105:47"/>Linnaeus divides all birds into ſix
claſſes: namely, into birds of the <hi>rapacious kind,</hi> birds of the
<hi>pie kind,</hi> birds of the <hi>poultry kind,</hi> birds of the
<hi>ſparrow kind,</hi> birds of the <hi>duck kind,</hi> and birds of the
<hi>crane kind.</hi> The four firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the various kinds of land
birds; the two laſt, thoſe that belong to the water.</p>
               <p>Birds of the <hi>rapacious kind</hi> conſtitute that claſs
of carnivorous fowl that live by rapine. He diſtinguiſhes them by their
beak, which is hooked, ſtrong, and notched at the point; by their legs, which
are ſhort and muſcular, and made for the purpoſes of tearing; by their
toes, which are ſtrong and knobbed; and their talons, which are ſharp and
crooked; by the make of their body, which is muſcular; and their fleſh,
which is impure: nor are they leſs known by their food, which conſiſts
entirely of fleſh; their ſtomach, which is membranous; and their manners,
which are fierce and cruel.</p>
               <p>Birds of the <hi>pie kind</hi> have the bill differing from the
former: as in thoſe it reſembled an hook, deſtined for tearing to pieces;
in theſe it reſembles a wedge, fitted for the purpoſe of cleaving. Their
legs are formed ſhort and ſtrong for walking; their body is ſlender and
impure, and their food miſcellaneous. They neſtle in trees; and the male
feeds the female during the time of incubation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0823900105:48"/>Birds of the <hi>poultry kind</hi> have the
bill a little convex, for the purpoſes of gathering their food. The upper
chap hangs over the lower; their bodies are fat and muſcular, and their
fleſh white and pure. They live upon grain, which is moiſtened in the crop.
They make their neſt on the ground, without art; they lay many eggs, and
uſe promiſcuous venery.</p>
               <p>Birds of the <hi>ſparrow kind</hi> comprehend all that
beautiful and vocal claſs that adorn our fields and groves, and gratify every
ſenſe in its turn. Their bills may be compared to a forceps that catches
hold: their legs are formed for hopping along; their bodies are tender; pure in
ſuch as feed upon grain, impure in ſuch as live upon inſects. They live
chiefly in trees; their neſts are artificially made, and their amours are
obſerved with connubial fidelity.</p>
               <p>Birds of the <hi>duck kind</hi> uſe their bill as a kind of
ſtrainer to their food; it is ſmooth, covered with a ſkin, and nervous at
the point. Their legs are ſhort, and their feet formed for ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the
toes being webbed together. Their body is fat, inclining to rancidity. They
live in waters, and chiefly build their neſts upon land.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the order of birds that belong to the waters,
thoſe of the <hi>crane kind</hi> have the <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0823900105:49"/> bill formed
for the purpoſes of ſearching and examining the bottom of pools: their legs
are long, and formed for wading; their toes are not webbed; their thighs are
half naked; their body is ſlender, and covered with a very thin ſkin; their
tail is ſhort, and their fleſh ſavoury. They live in lakes upon animals,
and they chiefly build their neſts upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Such is the diviſion of Linnaeus, with reſpect to this
claſs of animals; and at firſt ſight it appears natural and
comprehenſive. But we muſt not be deceived by appearances: the ſtudent,
who ſhould imagine he was making a progreſs in the hiſtory of nature,
while he was only thus making arbitrary diſtributions, would be very much
miſtaken. Should he come to enter deeper into this naturaliſt's plan, he
would find birds the moſt unlike in nature thrown together into the ſame
claſs; and find animals joined, that entirely differ in climate, in
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes, in manners, in ſhape, colouring and ſize. In ſuch a
diſtribution, for inſtance, he would find the humming-bird and the raven,
the rail and the oſtrich, joined in the ſame family. If when he aſked
what ſort of a creature was the humming-bird, he were told that it was in the
ſame claſs with the carrion crow, would he not think himſelf impoſed 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0823900105:50"/> upon? In ſuch a caſe, the only way to form any idea of
the animal whoſe hiſtory he deſires to know, is to ſee it; and that
curioſity very few have an opportunity of gratifying. The number of birds is
ſo great, that it might exhauſt the patience not only of the writer, but
the reader, to examine them all: in the preſent confined undertaking it would
certainly be impoſſible. I will therefore now attach myſelf to a more
natural method: and, ſtill keeping the general diviſion of Linnaeus before
me, enter into ſome deſcription of the moſt noted, or the moſt worth
knowing.</p>
               <p>Under one or other claſs, as I ſhall treat them, the reader
will probably find all the ſpecies, and all the varieties that demand his
curioſity. When the leader of any tribe is deſcribed, and its hiſtory
known, it will give a very tolerable idea of all the ſpecies contained under
it. It is true, the reader will not thus have his knowledge ranged under ſuch
preciſe diſtinctions; nor can he be able to ſay, with ſuch fluency,
that the rail is of the oſtrich claſs: but what is much more material, he
will have a tolerable hiſtory of the bird he deſires to know, or at leaſt
of that which moſt reſembles it in nature.</p>
               <p>However, it may be proper to apprize the <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0823900105:51"/>
reader that he will not here find his curioſity ſatisfied, as in ſome of
the former volumes, where we often took Mr. Buffon for our guide. Thoſe who
have hitherto written the natural hiſtory of birds, have in general been
contented with telling their names, or deſcribing their toes or their
plumage. It muſt often therefore happen, that inſtead of giving the
hiſtory of a bird, we muſt be content to importune the reader with merely
its deſcription. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divide the following hiſtory of birds,
with Linnaeus, into ſix parts: in the firſt of which I will give ſuch as
Briſſon has ranged among the rapacious birds; next thoſe of the pie kind;
and thus go on through the ſucceeding claſſes, till I finiſh with
thoſe of the duck kind. But before I enter upon a ſyſtematic detail, I
will beg leave to give the hiſtory of three or four birds, that do not well
range in any ſyſtem. Theſe, from their great ſize, are ſufficiently
diſtinguiſhable from the reſt; and from their incapacity of flying, lead
a life a good deal differing from the reſt of the feathered creation. The
birds I mean are the Oſtrich, the Caſſowary, the Emu, the Dodo, and the
Solitaire.</p>

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0823900105:53"/>IN beginning with the feathered tribe, the
firſt animal that offers ſeems to unite the claſs of quadrupedes and of
birds in itſelf. While it has the general outline and properties of a bird,
yet it retains many of the marks of the quadrupede. In appearance the oſtrich
reſembles the camel, and is almoſt as tall; it is covered with a plumage
that reſembles hair much more nearly than feathers, and its internal parts
bear as near a ſimilitude to thoſe of the quadrupede as of the bird
creation. It may be conſidered, therefore, as an animal made to fill up that
chaſm in nature which ſeparates one claſs of beings from another.</p>
               <p>The oſtrich is the largeſt of all birds. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers affirm
that they are ſeen as tall as a man on horſeback; and even ſome of
thoſe that have been brought into England were above ſeven feet high. The
head and bill ſomewhat reſemble thoſe of a duck; and the neck may be
likened to that of a ſwan, but that it is much longer; the legs and thighs
reſemble thoſe of an hen; though the whole appearance bears a ſtrong
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to that of a camel. But to be more <pb facs="tcp:0823900105:54"/>

particular; it is uſually ſeven feet high from the top of the head to the
ground; but from the back it is only four; ſo that the head and neck are
above three feet long. From the top of the head to the rump, when the neck is
ſtretched out in a right line, it is ſix feet long, and the tail is about a
foot more. One of the wings, without the feathers, is a foot and an half; and
being ſtretched out, with the feathers, is three feet.</p>
               <p>The plumage is much alike in all; that is, generally black and
white; though ſome of them are ſaid to be grey. The greateſt feathers are
at the extremities of the wings and tail, and the largeſt are generally
white. The next row is black and white; and of the ſmall feathers, on the
back and belly, ſome are white and others black. There are no feathers on the
ſides, nor yet on the thighs, nor under the wings. The lower part of the
neck, about half way, is covered with ſtill ſmaller feathers than thoſe
on the belly and back; and thoſe, like the former, alſo are of different
colours.</p>
               <p>All theſe feathers are of the ſame kind, and peculiar to the
oſtrich; for other birds have ſeveral ſorts, ſome of which are-ſoft
and downy, and others hard and ſtrong. Oſtrich feathers are almoſt all as
ſoft as down, being utterly <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0823900105:57"/> unfit to ſerve the animal
for flying, and ſtill leſs adapted to be a proper defence againſt
external in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. The feathers of other birds have the webs broader on one
ſide than the other, but thoſe of the oſtrich have their ſhaft exactly
in the middle. The upper part of the head and neck are covered with a very fine
clear white hair, that ſhines like the briſtles of a hog; and in ſome
places there are ſmall tufts of it, conſiſting of about twelve hairs,
which grow from a ſingle ſhaft about the thickneſs of a pin.</p>
               <p>At the end of each wing, there is a kind of ſpur almoſt like
the quill of a porcupine. It is an inch long, being hollow and of an horny
ſubſtance. There are two of theſe on each wing; the largeſt of which is
at the extremity of the bone of the wing, and the other a foot lower. The neck
ſeems to be more ſlender in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that of other birds, from its
not being furniſhed with feathers. The ſkin in this part is of a livid
fleſh colour, which ſome improperly would have to be blue. The bill is
ſhort and pointed, and two inches and an half at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. The external
form of the eye is like that of a man, the upper eye-lid being adorned with
eye-laſhes which are longer than thoſe on the lid below. The tongue is
ſmall, very ſhort, <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0823900105:58"/> and compoſed of cartilages,
ligaments, and membranes, intermixed with fleſhy fibres. In ſome it is
about an inch long, and very thick at the bottom. In others it is but half an
inch, being a little forked at the end.</p>
               <p>The thighs are very fleſhy and large, being covered with a
white ſkin, inclining to redneſs, and wrinkled in the manner of a net,
whoſe meſhes will admit the end of a finger. Some have very ſmall
feathers here and there on the thighs; and others again have neither feathers
nor wrinkles. What are called the legs of birds in this are covered before with
large ſcales. The end of the foot is cloven, and has two very large toes,
which, like the leg, are covered with ſcales. Theſe toes are of unequal
ſizes. The largeſt, which is on the inſide, is ſeven inches long,
including the claw, which is near three fourths of an inch in length, and
almoſt as broad. The other toe is but four inches long, and is without a
claw.</p>
               <p>The internal parts of this animal are formed with no leſs
ſurprizing peculiarity. At the top of the breaſt, under the ſkin, the fat
is two inches thick; and on the fore-part of the belly, it is as hard as
ſuet, and about two inches and an half thick in ſome places. It has two
diſtinct ſtomachs. The firſt, which is lowermoſt, in 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0823900105:59"/> its natural ſituation ſomewhat reſembles the crop in
other birds; but it is conſiderably larger than the other ſtomach, and is
furniſhed with ſtrong muſcular fibres, as well circular as lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudinal.
The ſecond ſtomach, or gizzard, has outwardly the ſhape of the ſtomach
of a man; and upon opening is always found filled with a variety of
diſcordant ſubſtances; hay, graſs, barley, beans, bones, and ſtones,
ſome of which exceed in ſize a pullet's egg. The kidneys are eight inches
long and two broad, and differ from thoſe of other birds in not being divided
into lobes. The heart and lungs are ſeparated by a midriff, as in
quadrupedes; and the parts of generation alſo bear a very ſtrong
reſemblance and analogy.</p>
               <p>Such is the ſtructure of this animal forming the ſhade that
unites birds and quadrupedes; and from this ſtructure its habits and manners
are entirely peculiar. It is a native only of the torrid regions of Africa, and
has long been celebrated by thoſe who have had occaſion to mention the
animals of that region. Its fleſh is proſcribed in Scripture as unfit to be
eaten; and moſt of the ancient writers deſcribe it as well known in their
times. Like the race of the elephant, it is tranſmitted down without mixture;
and has never been known to breed <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0823900105:60"/> out of that country
which firſt produced it. It ſeems formed to live among the ſandy and
burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſarts of the torrid zone; and, as in ſome meaſure it owes its
birth to their genial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, ſo it ſeldom migrates into tracts more
mild or more fertile. As that is the peculiar country of the elephant, the
rhinoceros, and camel, ſo it may readily be ſuppoſed capable of affording
a retreat to the oſtrich. They inhabit from preference the moſt ſolitary
and horrid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, where there are few vegetables to cloath the ſurface
of the earth, and where the rain never comes to refreſh it. The Arabians
aſſert that the oſtrich never drinks; and the place of its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
ſeems to confirm the aſſertion. In theſe formidable regions,
oſtriches are ſeen in large flocks, which to the diſtant ſpectator
appear like a regiment of cavalry, and have often alarmed a whole caravan.
There is no deſert, how barren ſoever, but what is capable of ſupplying
theſe animals with proviſion; they eat almoſt every thing; and theſe
barren tracts are thus doubly grateful, as they afford both food and
ſecurity. The oſtrich is of all other animals the moſt voracious. It will
devour leather, graſs, hair, iron, ſtones, or any thing that is given. Nor
are its powers of digeſtion leſs in ſuch things as are digeſtible.
Thoſe ſubſtances which the <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0823900105:61"/> coats of the ſtomach
cannot ſoften, paſs whole; ſo that glaſs, ſtones, or iron, are
excluded in the form in which they were devoured. All metals, indeed, which are
ſwallowed by any animal, loſe a part of their weight, and often the
extremities of their figure, from the action of the juices of the ſtomach
upon their ſurface. A quarter piſtole, which was ſwallowed by a duck,
loſt ſeven grains of its weight in the gizzard before it was voided; and it
is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that a ſtill greater diminution of weight would happen in the
ſtomach of an oſtrich; conſidered in this light, therefore, this animal
may be ſaid to digeſt iron; but ſuch ſubſtances ſeldom remain long
enough in the ſtomach of any animal to undergo ſo tedious a
diſſolution. However this be, the oſtrich ſwallows almoſt every thing
preſented to it. Whether this be from the neceſſity which ſmaller birds
are under of picking up gravel to keep the coats of their ſtomach aſunder,
or whether it be from a want of diſtinguiſhing by the taſte what
ſubſtances are fit and what incapable of digeſtion; certain it is, that
in the oſtrich diſſected by Ranby there appeared ſuch a quantity of
heterogeneous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that it was wonderful how any animal could
digeſt ſuch an overcharge of nouriſhment. Valiſnieri alſo found the
firſt ſtomach filled with <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0823900105:62"/> a quantity of incongruous
ſubſtances; graſs, nuts, cords, ſtones, glaſs, braſs, copper, iron,
tin, lead, and wood; a piece of ſtone was found among the reſt that weighed
more than a pound. He ſaw one of theſe animals that was killed by devouring
a quantity of quick-lime. It would ſeem that the oſtrich is obliged to fill
up the great capacity of its ſtomach in order to be at eaſe; but that
nutritious ſubſtances not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, it pours in whatever offers to
ſupply the void.</p>
               <p>In their native deſerts, however, it is probable they live
chiefly upon vegetables, where they lead an inoffenſive and ſocial life;
the male, as Thevenot aſſures us, aſſorting with the female with
connubial fidelity. They are ſaid to be very much inclined to venery; and the
make of the parts in both ſexes ſeems to confirm the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. It is
probable alſo they copulate, like other birds, by compreſſion; and they
lay very large eggs, ſome of them being above five inches in diameter, and
weighing above fifteen pounds. Theſe eggs have a very hard ſhell,
ſomewhat reſembling thoſe of the crocodile, except that thoſe of the
latter are leſs and rounder.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſon for laying depends on the climate where the
animal is bred. In the northern parts <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0823900105:63"/> of Africa, this
ſeaſon is about the beginning of July; in the ſouth, it is about the
latter end of December. Theſe birds are very prolific, and lay generally from
forty to fifty eggs at one clutch. It has been commonly reported that the
female depoſits them in the ſand; and, covering them up, leaves them to be
hatched by the heat of the climate, and then permits the young to ſhift for
themſelves. Very little of this however is true: no bird has a ſtronger
affection for her young than the oſtrich, nor none watches her eggs with
greater aſſiduity. It happens, indeed, in thoſe hot climates, that there
is leſs neceſſity for the continual incuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the female; and ſhe
more frequently leaves her eggs, which are in no fear of being chilled by the
weather: but though ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forſakes them by day, ſhe always
carefully broods over them by night; and Kolben, who has ſeen great numbers
of them at the Cape of Good Hope, affirms that they ſit on their eggs like
other birds, and that the male and female take this office by turns, as he had
frequent opportunities of obſerving. Nor is it more true what is ſaid of
their forſaking their young after they are excluded the ſhell. On the
contrary, the young ones are not even able to walk for ſeveral days after
they are hatched. During this <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0823900105:64"/> time, the old ones are very
aſſiduous in ſupplying them with graſs, and very careful to defend them
from danger: nay, they encounter every danger in their defence. It was a way of
take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them among the ancients, to plant a number of ſharp ſtakes round
the oſtrich's neſt in her abſence, upon which ſhe pierced herſelf at
her return. The young, when brought forth, are of an aſh colour the firſt
year, and are covered with feathers all over. But in time theſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
drop; and thoſe parts which are covered aſſume a different and more
becoming plumage.</p>
               <p>The beauty of a part of this plumage, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the long
feathers that compoſe the wings and tail, is the chief reaſon that man has
been ſo active in purſuing this harmleſs bird to its deſerts, and
hunting it with no ſmall degree of expence and labour. The ancients uſed
thoſe plumes in their helmets; the ladies of the eaſt make them an ornament
in their dreſs; and among us, our undertakers and our fine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtill
make uſe of them to decorate their hearſes and their hats. Thoſe feathers
which are plucked from the animal while alive are much more valued than thoſe
taken when dead, the latter being dry, light, and ſubject to be
worm-eaten.</p>
               <p>Beſide the value of their plumage, ſome of 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0823900105:65"/> the ſavage nations of Africa, hunt them alſo for their
fleſh; which they conſider as a dainty. They ſometimes alſo breed
theſe birds tame to eat the young ones, of which the female is ſaid to be
the greateſt delicacy. Some nations have obtained the name of Struthophagi,
or Oſtrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaters, from their peculiar fondneſs for this food; and even the
Romans themſelves were not averſe to it. Apicius gives us a receipt for
making ſauce for the oſtrich; and Heliogabalus is noted for having
dreſſed the brains of ſix hundred oſtriches in one diſh; for it was
his cuſtom never to eat but of one diſh in a day, but that was an
expenſive one. Even among the Europeans now, the eggs of the oſtrich are
ſaid to be well taſted, and extremely nouriſhing; but they are too
ſcarce to be fed upon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a ſingle egg be a ſufficient
entertainment for eight men.</p>
               <p>As the ſpoils of the oſtrich are thus valuable, it is not to
be wondered at that man has become their moſt aſſiduous purſuer. For
this purpoſe, the Arabians train up their beſt and fleeteſt horſes, and
hunt the oſtrich ſtill in view. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of all other varieties of the
chaſe, this, though the moſt laborious, is yet the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining. As
ſoon as the hunter comes within <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0823900105:66"/> ſight of his prey, he
puts on his horſe with a gentle gallop, ſo as to keep the oſtrich ſtill
in ſight; yet not ſo as to terrify him from the plain into the mountains.
Of all known animals that make uſe of their legs in running, the oſtrich is
by far the ſwifteſt: upon obſerving himſelf therefore purſued at a
diſtance, he begins to run at firſt but gently; either inſenſible of
his danger, or ſure of eſcaping. In this ſituation he ſomewhat
reſembles a man at full ſpeed; his wings, like two arms, keep working with
a motion correſpondent to that of his legs; and his ſpeed would very ſoon
ſnatch him from the view of his purſuers, but, unfortunately for the
ſilly creature, inſtead of going off in a direct line, he takes his
courſe in circles; while the hunters ſtill make a ſmall courſe within,
relieve each other, meet him at unexpected turns, and keep him thus ſtill
employed, ſtill followed for two or three days together. At laſt, ſpent
with fatigue and famine, and finding all power of eſcape impoſſible, he
endeavours to hide himſelf from thoſe enemies he cannot avoid, and covers
his head in the ſand, or the firſt thicket he meets. Sometimes, however, he
attempts to face his purſuers; and, though in general the moſt gentle
animal in nature, when driven to deſperation, he defends himſelf with 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0823900105:67"/> his beak, his wings and his feet. Such is the force of his
motion, that a man would be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unable to withſtand him in the
ſhock.</p>
               <p>The Struthophagi have another method of taking this bird: they
cover themſelves with an oſtrich's ſkin, and paſſing up an arm
through the neck, thus counterfeit all the motions of this animal. By this
artifice they approach the oſtrich, which becomes an eaſy prey. He is
ſometimes alſo taken by dogs and nets: but the moſt uſual way is that
mentioned above.</p>
               <p>When the Arabians have thus taken an oſtrich, they cut its
throat, and making a liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture below the opening, they ſhake the bird, as one
would rinſe a barrel: then taking off the ligature, there runs out from the
wound in the throat, a conſiderable quantity of blood, mixed with the fat of
the animal; and this is conſidered as one of their greateſt dainties. They
next flea the bird; and of the ſkin, which is ſtrong and thick, ſometimes
make a kind of veſt, which anſwers the purpoſes of a cuiraſs and a
buckler.</p>
               <p>There are others who, more compaſſionate or more provident,
do not kill their captive, but endeavour to tame it, for the purpoſes of
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying thoſe feathers which are in ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. The
inhabitants of Dara and Lybia breed up whole flocks of them, and they are tamed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0823900105:68"/> with very little trouble. But it is not for their feathers
alone that they are prized in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſtate; they are often ridden
upon, and uſed as horſes. Moore aſſures us, that at Joar he ſaw a man
travelling upon an oſtrich; and Adanſon aſſerts that, at the factory of
Podore, he had two oſtriches, which were then young, the ſtrongeſt of
which ran ſwifter than the beſt Engliſh racer, although he carried two
Negroes on his back. As ſoon as the animal perceived that it was thus loaded,
it ſet off running with all its force, and made ſeveral circuits round the
village; till at length the people were obliged to ſtop it, by barring up the
way. How far this ſtrength and ſwiftneſs may be uſeful to mankind, even
in a poliſhed ſtate, is a matter that perhaps deſerves enquiry.
Poſterity may avail themſelves of this creature's abilities; and riding
upon an oſtrich may one day become the favourite, as it moſt certainly is
the ſwifteſt, mode of conveyance.</p>
               <p>The parts of this animal are ſaid to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible to many
ſalutary purpoſes in medicine. The fat is ſaid to be emollient and
relaxing; that while it relaxes the tendons, it fortifies the nervous
ſyſtem; and being applied to the region of the loins, it abates the pains
of the ſtone in the kidney. The ſhell of the egg powdered, 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0823900105:69"/> and given in proper quantities, is ſaid to be uſeful
in promoting urine, and diſſolving the ſtone in the bladder. The
ſubſtance of the egg itſelf is thought to be peculiarly nouriſhing:
however, Galen, in mentioning this, aſſerts, that the eggs of hens and
pheaſants are good to be eaten; thoſe of geeſe and oſtriches are the
worſt of all.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. The Emu.</head>
               <p>OF this bird, which many call the American Oſtrich, but little
is certainly known. It is an inhabitant of the New Continent; and the
tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers who have mentioned it, ſeem to have been more ſolicitous in
proving its affinity to the oſtrich, than in deſcribing thoſe
peculiarities which diſtinguiſh it from all others of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
creation.</p>
               <p>It is chiefly found in Guiana, along the banks of the Oroonoko,
in the inland provinces of Braſil and Chili, and the vaſt foreſts that
border on the mouth of the river Plata. Many other parts of South America were
known to have them; but as men multiplied, theſe large and timorous birds
either fell beneath their ſuperior power, or fled from their vicinity.</p>
               <p>The Emu, though not ſo large as the oſtrich, is only
ſecond to it in magnitude. It is by much the largeſt bird in the New
Continent; and is generally found to be ſix feet high, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring from its
head to the ground. Its legs are three feet long; and its thigh is near as
thick as that of a man. The toes differ from thoſe <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0823900105:71"/> of
the oſtrich; as there are three in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican bird, and but two in the
former. Its neck is long, its head ſmall, and the bill flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, like that of
the oſtrich; but, in all other reſpects, it more reſembles a
Caſſowary, a large bird, to be deſcribed hereafter. The form of the body
appears round; the wings are ſhort, and entirely unfitted for flying, and it
entirely wants a tail. It is covered from the back and rump with long feathers,
which fall backward, and cover the anus: theſe feathers are grey upon the
back, and white on the belly. It goes very ſwiftly, and ſeems
aſſiſted in its motion by a kind of tubercle behind, like an heel, upon
which, on plain ground, it treads very ſecurely: in its courſe it uſes a
very odd kind of action, lifting up one wing, which it keeps elevated for a
time; till letting it drop, it lifts up the other. What the bird's intention
may be in thus keeping only one wing up, is not eaſy to diſcover; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it makes uſe of this as a ſail to catch the wind, or whether as a rudder to
turn its courſe, in order to avoid the arrows of the Indians, yet remains to
be aſcertained: however this be, the emu runs with ſuch a ſwiftneſs,
that the fleeteſt dogs are thrown out in the purſuit. One of them, finding
itſelf ſurrounded by the hunters, darted among the dogs with ſuch fury
that they <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0823900105:72"/> made way to avoid its rage; and it eſcaped, by
its amazing velocity, in ſafety to the mountains.</p>
               <p>As this bird is but little known, ſo travellers have given a
looſe to their imaginations in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing ſome of its actions, which
they were conſcious could not be eaſily contradicted. This animal, ſays
Nierenberg, is very peculiar in the hatching of its young. The male com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
twenty or thirty of the females to lay their eggs in one neſt; he then, when
they have done laying, chaſes them away, and places himſelf upon the eggs;
however, he takes the ſingular precaution of laying two of the number
aſide, which he does not ſit upon. When the young ones come forth, theſe
two eggs are addled; which the male having foreſeen, breaks one, and then
another, upon which multitudes of flies are found to ſettle; and theſe
ſupply the young brood with a ſufficiency of proviſion, till they are
able to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Wafer aſſerts, that he has ſeen great
quantities of this animal's eggs on the deſert ſhores, north of the river
Plata; where they were buried in the ſand, in order to be hatched by the heat
of the climate. Both this, as well as the preceding account, may be doubted:
and it is more probable that it was the crocodile's eggs which Wafer had
ſeen, which are undoubtedly hatched in that manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0823900105:73"/>When the young ones are hatched, they are
familiar, and follow the firſt perſon they meet. I have been followed
myſelf, ſays Wafer, by many of theſe young oſtriches; which, at
firſt, are extremely harmleſs and ſimple: but as they grow older, they
become more cunning and diſtruſtful; and run ſo ſwift, that a greyhound
can ſcarcely overtake them. Their fleſh, in general, is good to be eaten;
eſpecially if they be young. It would be no difficult matter to rear up
flocks of theſe animals tame, particularly as they are naturally ſo
familiar: and they might be found to anſwer domeſtic purpoſes, like the
hen, or the turkey. Their maintenance could not be expenſive, if, as
Narborough ſays, they live entirely upon graſs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. The Caſſowary.</head>
               <p>THE Caſſowary is a bird which was firſt brought into
Europe by the Dutch, from Java, in the Eaſt-Indies, in which part of the
world it is only to be found. Next to the preceding, it is the largeſt and
the heavieſt of the feathered ſpecies.</p>
               <p>The caſſowary, though not ſo large as the former, yet
appears more bulky to the eye; its body being nearly equal, and its neck and
legs much thicker and ſtronger in proportion; this conformation gives it an
air of ſtrength and force, which the fierceneſs and ſingularity of its
countenance conſpire to render formidable. It is five feet and an half long,
from the point of the bill to the extremity of the claws. The legs are two feet
and an half high, from the belly to the end of the claws. The head and neck
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are a foot and an half; and the largeſt toe, including the claw, is
five inches long. The claw alone of the leaſt toe, is three inches and a half
in length. The wing is ſo ſmall, that it does not appear; it being hid
under the feathers of the back. In other birds, a part of <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0823900105:77"/>
the feathers ſerve for flight, and are different from thoſe that ſerve
for merely covering; but in the caſſowary, all the feathers are of the
ſame kind, and outwardly of the ſame colour. They are generally double;
having two long ſhafts, which grow out of a ſhort one, which is fixed in
the ſkin. Thoſe that are double, are always of an unequal length; for
ſome are fourteen inches long, particularly on the rump; while others are not
above three. The beards that adorn the ſtem or ſhaft, are from about half
way to the end, very long, and as thick as an horſe hair, without being
ſubdivided into fibres. The ſtem or ſhaft is flat, ſhining, black, and
knotted below; and from each knot there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a beard: likewiſe, the
beards at the end of the large feathers are perfectly black; and towards the
root of a grey tawny colour; ſhorter, more ſoft, and throwing out fine
fibres, like down; ſo that nothing appears except the ends, which are hard
and black; becauſe the other part, compoſed of down, is quite covered.
There are feathers on the head and neck; but they are ſo ſhort, and thinly
ſown, that the bird's ſkin appears naked, except towards the hinder part of
the head, where they are a little longer. The feathers which adorn the rump,
are extremely thick; but do not differ, in other <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0823900105:78"/>
reſpects, from the reſt, excepting their being longer. The wings, when they
are deprived of their feathers, are but three inches long; and the feathers are
like thoſe on other parts of the body. The ends of the wings are adorned with
five prickles, of different lengths and thickneſs, which bend like a bow:
theſe are hollow from the roots to the very points, having only that ſlight
ſubſtance within which all quills are known to have. The longeſt of
theſe prickles is eleven inches; and it is a quarter of an inch in diameter
at the root, being thicker there than towards the extremity; the point ſeems
broken off.</p>
               <p>The part, however, which moſt diſtinguiſhes this animal is
the head; which, though ſmall, like that of an oſtrich, does not fail to
inſpire ſome degree of terror. It is bare of feathers, and is in a manner
armed with an helmet of horny ſubſtance, that covers it from the root of
the bill to near half the head backwards. This helmet is black before and
yellow behind. Its ſubſtance is very hard, being formed by the elevation of
the bone of the ſkull; and it conſiſts of ſeveral plates, one over
another, like the horn of an ox. Some have ſuppoſed that this was ſhed
every year with the feathers; but the moſt probable opinion is, that it only
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foliates <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0823900105:79"/> ſlowly like the beak. To the peculiar oddity
of this natural armour may be added the colour of the eye in this animal, which
is a bright yellow, and the globe being above an inch and an half in diameter,
give it an air equally fierce and extraordinary. At the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the upper
eye-lid, there is a row of ſmall hairs, over which there is another row of
black hair, which look pretty much like an eye-brow. The lower eye-lid, which
is the largeſt of the two, is furniſhed alſo with plenty of black hair.
The hole of the ear is very large and open, being only covered with ſmall
black feathers. The ſides of the head, about the eye and ear, being
deſtitute of any covering, are blue, except the middle of the lower eye-lid,
which is white. The part of the bill which anſwers to the upper jaw in other
animals, is very hard at the edges above, and the extremity of it like that of
a turkey-cock. The end of the lower mandible is ſlightly notched, and the
whole is of a greyiſh brown, except a green ſpot on each ſide. As the
beak admits a very wide opening, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes not a little to the bird's
menacing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The neck is of a violet colour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to that of
ſlate; and it is red behind in ſeveral places, but chiefly in the middle.
About the middle of the neck before, at the riſe of the <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0823900105:80"/>
large feathers, there are two proceſſes formed by the ſkin, which
reſemble ſomewhat the gills of a cock, but that they are blue as well as
red. The ſkin which covers the fore-part of the breaſt, on which this bird
leans and reſts, is hard, callous, and without feathers. The thighs and legs
are covered with feathers, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely thick, ſtrong, ſtraight, and
covered with ſcales of ſeveral ſhapes; but the legs are thicker a little
above the foot than in any other place. The toes are likewiſe covered with
ſcales, and are but three in number; for that which ſhould be behind is
wanting. The claws are of a hard ſolid ſubſtance, black without and white
within.</p>
               <p>The internal parts are equally remarkable. The caſſowary
unites with the double ſtomach of animals that live upon vegetables, the
ſhort inteſtines of thoſe that live upon fleſh. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines of
the caſſowary are thirteen times ſhorter than thoſe of the oſtrich.
The heart is very ſmall, being but an inch and an half long, and an inch
broad at the baſe. Upon the whole, it has the head of a warrior, the eye of a
lion, the defence of a porcupine, and the ſwiftneſs of a courſer.</p>
               <p>Thus formed for a life of hoſtility, for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying others,
and for its own defence, it might be expected that the caſſowary was one of
the <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0823900105:81"/> moſt fierce and terrible animals of the creation.
But nothing is ſo oppoſite to its natural character, nothing ſo different
from the life it is contented to lead. It never attacks others; and inſtead
of the bill, when attacked, it rather makes uſe of its legs, and kicks like
an horſe, or runs againſt its purſuer, beats him down, and treads him to
the ground.</p>
               <p>The manner of going of this animal is not leſs extraordinary
than its appearance. Inſtead of going directly forward, it ſeems to kick up
behind with one leg, and then making a bound onward with the other, it goes
with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious velocity, that the ſwifteſt racer would be left far
behind.</p>
               <p>The ſame degree of voraciouſneſs which we perceived in the
oſtrich, obtains as ſtrongly here. The caſſowary ſwallows every thing
that comes within the capacity of its gullet. The Dutch aſſert that it can
devour not only glaſs, iron, and ſtones, but even live and burning coals,
without teſtifying the ſmalleſt fear, or feeling the leaſt injury. It
is ſaid that the paſſage of the food through its gullet is performed ſo
ſpeedily, that even the very eggs which it has ſwallowed whole paſs
through it unbroken, in the ſame form they went down. In fact, the alimentary
canal of this animal, as was obſerved <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0823900105:82"/> above, is
extremely ſhort; and it may happen that many kinds of food are indigeſtible
in its ſtomach, as wheat or currants are to man, when ſwallowed whole.</p>
               <p>The caſſowary's eggs are of a grey aſh colour, inclining
to green. They are not ſo large nor ſo round as thoſe of the oſtrich.
They are marked with a number of little tubercles of a deep green, and the
ſhell is not very thick. The largeſt of theſe is found to be fifteen
inches round one way, and about twelve the other.</p>
               <p>The ſouthern parts of the moſt eaſtern Indies ſeems to
be the natural climate of the caſſowary. His domain, if we may ſo call
it, begins where that of the oſtrich terminates. The latter has never been
found beyond the Ganges; while the caſſowary is never ſeen nearer than
the iſlands of Banda, Sumatra, Java, the Molucca Iſlands, and the
correſponding parts of the continent. Yet even here this animal ſeems not
to have multiplied in any conſiderable degree, as we find one of the kings of
Java making a preſent of one of theſe birds to the captain of a Dutch
ſhip, conſidering it as a very great rarity. The oſtrich, that has kept
in the deſert and unpeopled regions of Africa, is ſtill numerous, and the
unrivalled tenant of its own inhoſpitable cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. But the caſſowary,
that is the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <pb facs="tcp:0823900105:83"/>

               <head>CHAP. VII. The Dodo.</head>
               <p>MANKIND have generally made ſwiftneſs the attribute of
birds; but the Dodo has no title to this diſtinction. Inſtead of exciting
the idea of ſwiftneſs by its appearance, it ſeems to ſtrike the
imagination as a thing the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy and inactive of all nature. Its
body is maſſive, almoſt round, and covered with grey feathers; it is
juſt barely ſupported upon two ſhort thick legs like pillars, while its
head and neck riſe from it in a manner truly groteſque. The neck, thick and
purſy, is joined to the head, which conſiſts of two great chaps, that
open far behind the eyes, which are large, black and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent; ſo that the
animal when it gapes ſeems to be all mouth. The bill therefore is of an
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary length, not flat and broad, but thick, and of a bluiſh white,
ſharp at the end, and each chap crooked in oppoſite directions. They
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble two pointed ſpoons that are laid together by the backs. From all
this reſults a ſtupid and voracious phyſiognomy; which is ſtill more
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by a bordering of feathers round the root of the beak, and which
give the appearance of an <pb facs="tcp:0823900105:88"/>

animals implies ſtrength, in this only contributes to inactivity. The
oſtrich, or the caſſowary, are no more able to fly than the animal before
us; but then they ſupply that defect by their ſpeed in running. The dodo
ſeems weighed down by its own hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, and has ſcarce ſtrength to
urge itſelf forward. It ſeems among birds what the ſloth is among
quadrupedes, an unreſiſting thing, equally incapable of flight or defence.
It is furniſhed with wings, covered with ſoft aſh-coloured feathers, but
they are too ſhort to aſſiſt it in flying. It is furniſhed with a
tail, with a few ſmall curled feathers; but this tail is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned
and diſplaced. Its legs are too ſhort for running, and its body too fat to
be ſtrong. One would take it for a tortoiſe that had ſupplied itſelf
with the feathers of a bird; and that thus dreſſed out with the
inſtruments of flight, it was only ſtill the more unwieldy.</p>
               <p>This bird is a native of the Iſle of France; and the Dutch,
who firſt diſcovered it there, called it in their language the
<hi>nauſeous bird,</hi> as well from its diſguſting figure as from the
bad taſte of its fleſh. However, ſucceeding obſervers contradict this
firſt report, and aſſert that its fleſh is good and wholeſome eating.
It is a ſilly <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0823900105:92"/> ſimple bird, as may very well be
ſuppoſed from its figure, and is very eaſily taken. Three or four dodos
are enough to dine an hundred men.</p>
               <p>Whether the dodo be the ſame bird with that which ſome
travellers have deſcribed under the bird of Nazareth, yet remains uncertain.
The country from whence they both come is the ſame; their incapacity of
flying is the ſame; the form of the wings and body in both are ſimilar; but
the chief difference given is in the colour of the feathers, which in the
female of the bird of Nazareth are ſaid to be extremely beautiful; and in the
length of their legs, which in the dodo are ſhort; in the other, are
deſcribed as long. Time and future obſervation muſt clear up theſe
doubts; and the teſtimony of a ſingle witneſs, who ſhall have ſeen
both, will throw more light on the ſubject than the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of an
hundred philoſophers.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of Rapacious Birds in General.</head>
               <p>THERE ſeems to obtain a general reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in all the
claſſes of nature. As among quadrupedes a part were ſeen to live upon the
vegetable productions of the earth, and another part upon the fleſh of each
other, ſo among birds; ſome live upon vegetable food, and others by rapine,
deſtroying all ſuch as ſuch as want force or ſwiftneſs to procure
their ſafety. By thus peopling the woods with animals of different
diſpoſitions, Nature has wiſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the multiplication of life;
ſince, could we ſuppoſe that there were as many ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals produced as
there were vegetables ſupplied to ſuſtain them, yet there might ſtill
be another claſs of animals formed, which could find a ſufficient
ſuſtenance by feeding upon ſuch of the vegetable feeders as happened to
fall by the courſe of nature. By this contrivance, a greater number will be
ſuſtained upon the whole; for the numbers would be but very thin were every
creature a candidate for the ſame food. Thus, by ſupplying a variety of
appetites, Nature has alſo multiplied life in her productions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0823900105:94"/>In thus varying their appetites, Nature has
alſo varied the form of the animal; and while ſhe has given ſome an
inſtinctive paſſion for animal food, ſhe has alſo furniſhed them
with powers to obtain it. All land-birds of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious kinds are
furniſhed with a large head, and a ſtrong crooked beak, notched at the end,
for the purpoſe of tearing their prey. They have ſtrong ſhort legs, and
ſharp crooked talons for the purpoſe of ſeizing it. Their bodies are
formed for war, being fibrous and muſcular; and their wings for ſwiftneſs
of flight, being well feathered and expanſive. The ſight of ſuch as prey
by day is aſtoniſhingly quick; and ſuch as ravage by night, have their
ſight ſo fitted as to ſee objects in darkneſs with extreme
preciſion.</p>
               <p>Their internal parts are equally formed for the food they ſeek
for. Their ſtomach is ſimple and membranous, and wrapped in fat to
encreaſe the powers of digeſtion; and their inteſtines are ſhort and
glandular. As their food is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent and juicy, they want no length of
inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinal tube to form it into proper nouriſhment. Their food is fleſh;
which does not require a ſlow digeſtion, to be converted into a
ſimilitude of ſubſtance to their own.</p>
               <p>Thus formed for war, they lead a life of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude 
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0823900105:95"/> and rapacity. They inhabit, by choice, the moſt lonely
places and the moſt deſert mountains. They make their neſts in the clefts
of rocks, and on the higheſt and moſt inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible trees of the
foreſt. Whenever they appear in the cultivated plain, or the warbling grove,
it is only for the purpoſes of depredation; and are gloomy intruders on the
general joy of the landſcape. They ſpread terror wherever they approach:
all that variety of muſic which but a moment before enlivened the grove, at
their appearing is inſtantly at an end: every order of leſſer birds
ſeek for ſafety, either by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment or flight; and ſome are even
driven to take protection with man, to avoid their leſs merciful
purſuers.</p>
               <p>It would indeed be fatal to all the ſmaller race of birds, if,
as they are weaker than all, they were alſo purſued by all; but it is
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived wiſely for their ſafety, that every order of carnivorous birds
ſeek only for ſuch as are of the ſize moſt approaching their own. The
ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle flies at the buſtard or the pheaſant; the ſparrow-hawk purſues
the thruſh and the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. Nature has provided that each ſpecies ſhould
make war only on ſuch as are furniſhed with adequate means of eſcape. The
ſmalleſt birds avoid their purſuers by the extreme agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0823900105:96"/> rather than the ſwiftneſs of their flight; for every
order would ſoon be at an end, if the eagle, to its own ſwiftneſs of
wing, added the verſality of the ſparrow.</p>
               <p>Another circumſtance which tends to render the tyranny of
theſe animals more ſupportable is, that they are leſs fruitful than other
birds; breeding but few at a time. Thoſe of the larger kind ſeldom produce
above four eggs, often but two; thoſe of the ſmaller kinds, never above
ſix or ſeven. The pigeon, it is true, that is their prey, never breeds
above two at a time; but then ſhe breeds every month in the year. The
carnivorous kinds only breed annually, and of conſequence their fecundity is
ſmall in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</p>
               <p>As they are fierce by nature, and are difficult to be tamed,
ſo this fierceneſs extends even to their young, which they force from the
neſt ſooner than birds of the gentler kind. Other birds ſeldom forſake
their young till able, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely, to provide for themſelves; the rapacious
kinds expel them from the neſt at a time when they ſtill ſhould protect
and ſupport them. This ſeverity to their young proceeds from the
neceſſity of providing for themſelves. All animals that, by the
conformation of their ſtomach and inteſtines, are obliged to live upon
fleſh, and <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0823900105:97"/> ſupport themſelves by prey, though they
may be mild when young, ſoon become fierce and miſchievous, by the very
habit of uſing thoſe arms with which they are ſupplied by Nature. As it
is only by the deſtruction of other animals that they can ſubſiſt, they
become more furious every day; and even the parental feelings are overpowered
in their general habits of cruelty. If the power of obtaining a ſupply be
difficult, the old ones ſoon drive their brood from the neſt to ſhift for
themſelves, and often deſtroy them in a fit of fury cauſed by hunger.</p>
               <p>Another effect of this natural and acquired ſeverity is, that
almoſt all birds of prey are unſociable. It has long been obſerved, by
Ariſtotle, that all birds, with crooked beaks and talons, are ſolitary:
like quadrupedes of the cat kind, they lead a lonely wandering life, and are
united only in pairs, by that inſtinct which overpowers their rapacious
habits of enmity with all other animals. As the male and female are often
neceſſary to each other in their purſuits, ſo they ſometimes live
together; but, except at certain ſeaſons, they moſt uſually prowl
alone; and, like robbers, enjoy in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude the fruits of their plunder.</p>
               <p>All birds of prey are remarkable for one <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0823900105:98"/>
ſingularity, for which it is not eaſy to account. All the males of theſe
birds are about a third leſs, and weaker than the females; contrary to what
obtains among quadrupedes, among which the males are always the largeſt and
boldeſt: from thence the male is called, by falconers, a <hi>tarcel</hi>;
that is, a tierce or third leſs than the other. The reaſon of this
difference cannot proceed from the neceſſity of a larger body in the
fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male for the purpoſes of breeding, and that her volume is thus encreaſed
by the quantity of her eggs; for in other birds, that breed much faſter, and
that lay in much greater proportion, ſuch as the hen, the duck, or the
pheaſant, the male is by much the largeſt of the two. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the
cauſe, certain it is, that the females, as Willoughby expreſſes it, are
of greater ſize, more beautiful and lovely for ſhape and colours,
ſtronger, more fierce and generous, than the males; whether it may be that it
is neceſſary for the female to be thus ſuperior; as it is incumbent upon
her to provide, not only for herſelf, but her young ones alſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds, like quadrupedes of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous kind, are
all lean and meagre. Their fleſh is ſtringy and ill-taſted, ſoon
corrupting, and tinctured with the flavour of that animal <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0823900105:99"/>
food upon which they ſubſiſt. Nevertheleſs, Belonius aſſerts, that
many people admire the fleſh of the vulture and falcon, and dreſs them for
eating, when they meet with any accident that unfits them for the chace. He
aſſerts, that the Oſprey, a ſpecies of the eagle, when young, is
excellent food; but he contents himſelf with adviſing us, to breed theſe
birds up for our pleaſure rather in the field, than for the table.</p>
               <p>Of land birds of a rapacious nature, there are five kinds. The
eagle kind, the hawk kind, the vulture kind, the horned, the ſcreech owl
kind. The diſtinctive marks of this claſs, are taken from their claws and
beak: their toes are ſeparated: their legs are feathered to the heel: their
toes are four in number; three before, one behind: their beak is ſhort, thick
and crooked.</p>
               <p>The eagle kind is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by his beak,
which is ſtraight till towards the end, when it begins to hook downwards.</p>
               <p>The vulture kind is diſtinguiſhed by the head and neck: he
is without feathers.</p>
               <p>The hawk kind by the beak; being hooked from the very root.</p>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0823900105:102"/> THE Golden Eagle is the largeſt and the
nobleſt of all thoſe birds that have received the name of Eagle. It weighs
above twelve pounds. Its length is three feet; the extent of its wings, ſeven
feet four inches; the bill is three inches long, and of a deep blue colour; and
the eye of an hazel colour. The ſight and ſenſe of ſmelling are very
acute. The head and neck are cloathed with narrow ſharp pointed fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and of a deep brown colour, bordered with tawny; but thoſe on the crown of
the head, in very old birds, turn grey. The whole body, above as well as
beneath, is of a dark brown; and the feathers of the back are finely clouded
with a deeper ſhade of the ſame. The wings when cloathed reach to the end
of the tail. The quill feathers are of a chocolate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the ſhafts white.
The tail is of a deep brown, irregularly barred and blotched with an obſcure
aſh-colour, and uſually white at the roots of the feathers. The legs are
yellow, ſhort, and very ſtrong, being three inches in circumference, and
feathered to the very feet. <pb facs="tcp:0823900105:103"/>

are covered with large ſcales, and armed with the moſt formidable claws,
the middle of which are two inches long.</p>
               <p>In the rear of this terrible bird follow the the <hi>ring tailed
eagle,</hi> the <hi>common eagle,</hi> the <hi>bald eagle,</hi> the <hi>white
eagle,</hi> the <hi>kough-footed eagle,</hi> the <hi>erne,</hi> the <hi>black
eagle,</hi> the <hi>oſprey,</hi> the <hi>ſea-eagle,</hi> and the
<hi>crowned eagle.</hi> Theſe, and others that might be added, form different
ſhades in this fierce family; but have all the ſame rapacity, the ſame
general form, the ſame habits, and the ſame manner of bringing up their
young.</p>
               <p>In general, theſe birds are found in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous and
ill-peopled countries, and breed among the loftieſt cliffs. They chuſe
thoſe places which are remoteſt from man, upon whoſe poſſeſſions
they but ſeldom make their depredations, being contented rather to follow the
wild game in the foreſt than to riſque their ſafety to ſatisfy their
hunger.</p>
               <p>This fierce animal may be conſidered among birds as the lion
among quadrupedes; and in many reſpects they have a ſtrong ſimilitude to
each other. They are both poſſeſſed of force, and an empire over their
fellows of the foreſt. Equally magnanimous, they diſdain ſmaller plunder;
and only purſue animals worthy the conqueſt. It is not till after having
been long <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0823900105:106"/> provoked, by the cries of the rook or the
magpie, that this generous bird thinks fit to puniſh them with death: the
eagle alſo diſdains to ſhare the plunder of another bird; and will take
up with no other prey but that which he has acquired by his own purſuits. How
hungry ſoever he may be, he never ſtoops to carrion; and when ſatiated,
he never returns to the ſame carcaſs, but leaves it for other animals, more
rapacious and leſs delicate than he. Solitary, like the lion, he keeps the
deſart to himſelf alone; it is as extraordinary to ſee two pair of eagles
in the ſame mountain, as two lions in the ſame foreſt. They keep
ſeparate, to find a more ample ſupply; and conſider the quantity of their
game as the beſt proof of their dominion. Nor does the ſimilitude of
theſe animals ſtop here: they have both ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eyes, and nearly of
the ſame colour; their claws are of the ſame form, their breath equally
ſtrong, and their cry equally loud and terrifying. Bred both for war, they
are enemies of all ſociety: alike fierce, proud, and incapable of being
eaſily tamed. It requires great patience and much art to tame an eagle; and
even though taken young, and brought under by long aſſiduity, yet ſtill
it is a dangerous domeſtic, and often turns its force againſt its maſter.
When <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0823900105:107"/> brought into the field for the purpoſes of
fowling, the falconer is never ſure of its attachment: that innate pride, and
love of liberty, ſtill prompt it to regain its native ſolitudes; and the
moment the falconer ſees it, when let looſe, firſt ſtoop towards the
ground, and then riſe perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly into the clouds, he gives up all his
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer labour for loſt; quite ſure of never beholding his late priſoner
more. Sometimes, however, they are brought to have an attachment for their
feeder: they are then highly ſerviceable, and liberally provide for his
pleaſures and ſupport. When the falconer lets them go from his hand, they
play about and hover round him till their game preſents, which they ſee at
an immenſe diſtance, and purſue with certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>Of all animals the eagle flies higheſt; and from thence the
ancients have given him the epithet of <hi>the bird of Heaven.</hi> Of all
others alſo, he has the quickeſt eye; but his ſenſe of ſmelling is
far inferior to that of the vulture. He never purſues, therefore, but in
ſight; and when he has ſeized his prey, he ſtoops from his height, as if
to examine its weight, always lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on the ground before he carries it
off. As his wing is very powerful, yet, as he has but little ſuppleneſs in
the joints of the leg, he <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0823900105:108"/> finds it difficult to riſe
when down; however, if not inſtantly purſued, he finds no difficulty in
carrying off geeſe and cranes. He alſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away hares, lambs, and
kids; and often deſtroys fawns and calves, to drink their blood, and carries
a part of their fleſh to his retreat. Infants themſelves, when left
unattended, have been deſtroyed by theſe rapacious creatures; which
probably gave riſe to the fable of Gany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede's being ſnatched up by an
eagle to heaven.</p>
               <p>An inſtance is recorded in Scotland of two children being
carried off by eagles; but fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately they received no hurt by the way; and,
the eagles being purſued, the children were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unhurt out of the
neſts to the affrighted parents.</p>
               <p>The eagle is thus at all times a formidable neighbour; but
peculiarly when bringing up its young. It is then that the female, as well as
the male, exert all their force and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to ſupply their young. Smith,
in his Hiſtory of Kerry, relates, that a poor man in that country got a
comfortable ſubſiſtence for his family, during a ſummer of famine, out
of an eagle's neſt, by robbing the eaglets of food, which was plentifully
ſupplied by the old ones. He protracted their aſſiduity beyond the
uſual <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0823900105:109"/> time, by clipping the wings, and retarding the
flight of the young; and very probably alſo, as I have known myſelf, by
ſo tying them as to encreaſe their cries, which is always found to
encreaſe the parent's diſpatch to procure them proviſion. It was lucky,
however, that the old eagles did not ſurprize the countryman as he was thus
employed, as their reſentment might have been dangerous.</p>
               <p>It happened ſome time ago, in the ſame country, that a
peaſant reſolved to rob the neſt of an eagle, that had built in a ſmall
iſland, in the beautiful lake of Killarney. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtripped, and
ſwam in upon the iſland while the old ones were away; and, robbing the
neſt of its young, he was preparing to ſwim back, with the eaglets tied in
a ſtring; but, while he was yet up to his chin in the water, the old eagles
returned, and, miſſing their young, quickly fell upon the plunderer, and,
in ſpite of all his reſiſtance, diſpatched him with their beaks and
talons.</p>
               <p>In order to extirpate theſe pernicious birds, there is a law
in the Orkney Iſlands which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles any perſon that kills an eagle to a
hen out of every houſe in the pariſh in which the plunderer is killed.</p>
               <p>The neſt of the eagle is uſually built in the moſt
inacceſſible cliff of the rock, and often <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0823900105:110"/> ſhielded
from the weather by ſome jutting crag that hangs over it. Sometimes, however,
it is wholly expoſed to the winds, as well ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as above; for the
neſt is flat, though built with great labour. It is ſaid that the ſame
neſt ſerves the eagle during life; and indeed the pains beſtowed in
forming it ſeems to argue as much. One of theſe was found in the Peak of
Derbyſhire; which Willoughby thus deſcribes. 
<q rend="inline">"It was made of great ſticks, reſting one
end on the edge of a rock, the other on two birch-trees. Upon theſe was a
layer of ruſhes, and over them a layer of heath, and upon the heath ruſhes
again; upon which lay one young one, and an addle egg; and by them a lamb, a
hare, and three heath-pouts. The neſt was about two yards ſquare, and had
no hollow in it. The young eagle was of the ſhape of a goſhawk, of almoſt
the weight of a gooſe, rough footed, or feathered down to the foot, having a
white ring about the tail."</q> Such is the place where the female eagle
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſits her eggs; which ſeldom exceed two at a time in the larger
ſpecies, and not above three in the ſmalleſt. It is ſaid that ſhe
hatches them for thirty days: but frequently, even of this ſmall number of
eggs, a part is addled; and it is extremely rare to find three eaglets in the 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0823900105:111"/> ſame neſt. It is aſſerted, that as ſoon as the
young ones are ſomewhat grown, the mother kills the moſt feeble or the
moſt voracious. If this happens, it muſt proceed only from the
neceſſities of the parent, who is incapable of providing for their
ſupport; and is content to ſacrifice a part to the welfare of all.</p>
               <p>The plumage of the eaglets is not ſo ſtrongly marked as when
they come to be adult. They are at firſt white; then inclining to yellow; and
at laſt of light brown. Age, hunger, long cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and diſeaſes, make
them whiter. It is ſaid, they live above an hundred years; and that they at
laſt die, not of old age, but from the beaks turning inward upon the under
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and thus preventing their taking any food. They are equally
remarkable, ſays Mr. Penant, for their longevity, and for their power of
ſuſtaining a long abſence from food. One of this ſpecies, which has now
been nine years in the poſſeſſion of Mr. Owen Holland, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
lived thirty-two years with the gentleman who made him a preſent of it; but
what its age was when the latter received it from Ireland, is unknown. The
ſame bird alſo furniſhes a proof of the truth of the other remark; having
once, through the neglect of ſervants, endured hunger for twenty-one days,
without any ſuſtenance whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0823900105:112"/>Thoſe eagles which are kept tame, are fed
with every kind of fleſh, whether freſh or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting; and when there is a
deficiency of that, bread, or any other proviſion, will ſuffice. It is very
dangerous approaching them if not quite tame; and they ſometimes ſend forth
a loud piercing lamentable cry, which renders them ſtill more formidable. The
eagle drinks but ſeldom; and perhaps, when at liberty, not at all, as the
blood of his prey ſerves to quench his thirſt. His excrements are always
ſoft and moiſt, and tinged with that whitiſh ſubſtance which, as was
ſaid before, mixes in birds with the urine.</p>
               <p>Such are the general characteriſtics and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes of the
eagle; however, in ſome theſe habitudes differ, as the Sea Eagle and the
Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey live chiefly upon fiſh, and conſequently build their neſts on
the ſea-ſhore, and by the ſides of rivers, on the ground among reeds; and
often lay three or four eggs, rather leſs than thoſe of a hen, of a white
eliptical form. They catch their prey, which is chiefly fiſh, by darting down
upon them from above. The Italians compare the violent deſcent of theſe
birds on their prey, to the fall of lead into water; and call them Aquilla
Piombina, or the Leaden Eagle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0823900105:113"/>Nor is the Bald Eagle, which is an
inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of North Carolina, leſs remarkable for habits peculiar to
itſelf. Theſe birds breed in that country all the year round. When the
eaglets are juſt covered with down and a ſort of white wooly feathers, the
female eagle lays again. Theſe eggs are left to be hatched by the warmth of
the young ones that continue in the neſt; ſo that the flight of one brood
makes room for the next, that are but juſt hatched. Theſe birds fly very
heavily; ſo that they cannot overtake their prey, like others of the ſame
denomination. To remedy this, they often attend a ſort of fiſhing-hawk,
which they purſue, and ſtrip the plunderer of its prey. This is the more
remarkable, as this hawk flies ſwifter than they. Theſe eagles alſo
generally attend upon fowlers in the winter; and when any birds are wounded,
they are ſure to be ſeized by the eagle, though they may fly from the
fowler. This bird will often alſo ſteal young pigs, and carry them alive to
the neſt, which is compoſed of twigs, ſticks and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh: it is large
enough to fill the body of a cart; and is commonly full of bones half eaten,
and putrid fleſh, the ſtench of which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</p>
               <p>

               <p>WE might now come to ſpeak of the vulture kind, as they hold
the next rank to the eagle; but we are interrupted in our method, by the
conſideration of an enormous bird, whoſe place is not yet aſcertained; as
naturaliſts are in doubt whether to refer it to the eagle tribe, or to that
of the vulture. Its great ſtrength, force, and vivacity, might plead for its
place among the former; the baldneſs of its head and neck might be thought to
degrade it among the latter. In this uncertainty, it will be enough to
deſcribe the bird, by the lights we have, and leave fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hiſtorians to
ſettle its rank in the feathered creation. Indeed, if ſize and ſtrength,
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with rapidity of flight and rapacity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve pre-eminence, no
bird can be put in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with it.</p>
               <p>The Condor poſſeſſes, in an higher degree than the
eagle, all the qualities that render it formidable, not only to the feathered
kind, but to beaſts, and even to man himſelf. Acoſta, Garcilaſſo, and
Deſmarchais, aſſert, that it is eighteen feet acroſs, the wings
extended. <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0823900105:121"/> The beak is ſo ſtrong as to pierce the
body of a cow; and two of them are able to devour it. They do not even
abſtain from man himſelf: but fortunately there are but few of the
ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; for if they had been plenty, every order of animals muſt have
carried on an unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful war againſt them. The Indians aſſert,
that they will carry off a deer, or a young calf, in their talons, as eagles
would an hare or a rabbit; that their ſight is piercing, and their air
terrible; that they ſeldom frequent the foreſts, as they require a large
ſpace for the diſplay of their wings; but that they are found on the
ſea-ſhore, and the banks of rivers, whither they deſcend from their
heights of the mountains. By later accounts we learn, that they come down to
the ſea-ſhore only at certain ſeaſons, when their prey happens to fail
them upon land; that they then feed upon dead fiſh, and ſuch other
nutritious ſubſtances as the ſea throws up on the ſhore. We are
aſſured, however, that their countenance is not ſo terrible as the old
writers have repreſented it; but that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of a milder nature than
either the eagle or the vulture.</p>
               <p>Condamine has frequently ſeen them in ſeveral parts of the
mountains of Quito, and obſerved them hovering over a flock of ſheep; and
he <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0823900105:122"/> thinks they would, at a certain time, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to carry one off, had they not been ſcared away by the ſhepherds. Labat
acquaints us, that thoſe who have ſeen this animal, declare that the body
is as large as that of a ſheep; and that the fleſh is tough, and as
diſagreeable as carrion. The Spaniards themſelves ſeem to dread its
depredations; and there have been many inſtances of its carrying off their
children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Strong, the maſter of a ſhip, as he was ſailing along
the coaſts of Chili, in the thirty-third degree of ſouth latitude,
obſerved a bird ſitting upon a high cliff near the ſhore, which ſome of
the ſhip's company ſhot with a leaden bullet and killed. They were greatly
ſurprized when they beheld its magnitude; for when the wings were extended,
they meaſured thirteen feet from one tip to the other. One of the quills was
two feet four inches long; and the barrel, or hollow part, was ſix inches and
three quarters, and an inch and an half in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>We have a ſtill more circumſtantial account of this amazing
bird, by P. Feuillée, the only traveller who has accurately deſcribed
it: 
<q rend="inline">"In the valley of Ilo in Peru, I diſcovered a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, perched on a high rock before me: I approached within gun-ſhot and
fired; but, <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0823900105:123"/> as my piece was only charged with
ſwan-ſhot, the lead was not able ſufficiently to pierce the bird's
feathers. I perceived, however, by its manner of flying, that it was wounded;
and it was with a good deal of difficulty that it flew to another rock, about
five hundred yards diſtant on the ſea-ſhore. I therefore charged again
with ball, and hit the bird under the throat, which made it mine. I accordingly
ran up to ſeize it; but, even in death it was terrible, and defended itſelf
upon its back, with its claws extended againſt me, ſo that I ſcarce knew
how to lay hold of it. Had it not been mortally wounded, I ſhould have found
it no eaſy matter to take it; but I at laſt dragged it down from the rock,
and with the aſſiſtance of one of the ſeamen, I carried it to my tent,
to make a coloured drawing. 
<p> "The wings of this bird, which I meaſured very exactly,
were twelve feet three inches (Engliſh) from tip to tip. The great fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that were of a beautiful ſhining black, were two feet four inches long. The
thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the beak was proportionable to the reſt of the body; the
length about four inches; the point hooked downwards, and white at its
extremity; and the other part <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0823900105:124"/> was of a jet black. A
ſhort down, of a brown colour, covered the head; the eyes were black, and
ſurrounded with a circle of red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh brown. The feathers, on the breaſt,
neck and wings, were of a light brown; thoſe on the back were rather darker.
Its thighs were covered with brown feathers to the knee. The thigh bone was ten
inches long; the leg five inches: the toes were three before, and one behind:
that behind was an inch and an half; and the claw with which it was armed, was
black, and three quarters of an inch. The other claws were in the ſame
proportion; and the leg was covered with black ſcales, as alſo the toes;
but in theſe the ſcales were larger.</p> 
                     <p> "Theſe birds uſually keep in the mountains, where they
find their prey: they never deſcend to the ſea-ſhore, but in the rainy
ſeaſon; for as they are very ſenſible of cold, they go there for
greater warmth. Though theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are ſituated in the torrid zone,
the cold is often very ſevere; for a great part of the year they are covered
with ſnow, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in winter.</p> 
                     <p> "The little nouriſhment which theſe birds find on the
ſea-coaſt, except when the tempeſt drives in ſome great fiſh, obliges
the condor <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0823900105:125"/> to continue there but a ſhort time. They
uſually come to the coaſt at the approach of evening; ſtay there all
night, and fly back in the morning."</p> 
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is doubted whether this animal be proper to America only, or
whether it may not have been deſcribed by the naturaliſts of other
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. It is ſuppoſed, that the great bird called the Rock,
deſcribed by Arabian writers, and ſo much exaggerated by fable, is but a
ſpecies of the condor. The great bird of Tarnaſſar, in the Eaſt Indies,
that is larger than the eagle, as well as the vulture of Senegal, that carries
off children, are probably no other than the bird we have been deſcribing.
Ruſſia, Lapland, and even Switzerland and Germany, are ſaid to have known
this animal. A bird of this kind was ſhot in France, that weighed eighteen
pound, and was ſaid to be eighteen feet acroſs the wings: however, one of
the quills was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed only as being larger than that of a ſwan; ſo
that probably the breadth of the wings may have been exaggerated, ſince a
bird ſo large would have the quills more than twice as big as thoſe of a
ſwan. However this be, we are not to regret that it is ſcarcely ever ſeen
in Europe, as it appears to be one of the moſt formidable enemies of mankind.
In the deſerts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomac, <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0823900105:126"/> where it is chiefly
ſeen, men ſeldom venture to travel. Thoſe wild regions are very
ſufficient of themſelves to inſpire a ſecret horror: broken
precipices—prowling panthers—foreſts only vocal with the
hiſſing of ſerpents—and mountains rendered ſtill more terrible by
the condor, the only bird that ventures to make its reſidence in thoſe
deſerted ſituations.</p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0823900105:128"/> THE firſt rank in the deſcription of
birds, has been given to the eagle; not becauſe it is ſtronger or larger
than the vulture, but becauſe it is more generous and bold. The eagle,
unleſs preſſed by famine, will not ſtoop to carrion; and never devours
but what he has earned by his own purſuit. The vulture, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is
indelicately voracious; and ſeldom attacks living animals, when it can be
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the dead. The eagle meets and ſingly oppoſes his enemy;
the vulture, if it expects reſiſtance, calls in the aid of its kind, and
baſely overpowers its prey by a cowardly combination. Putrefaction and
ſtench, inſtead of deterring, only ſerves to allure them. The vulture
ſeems among birds, what the jackall and hyaena are among quadrupedes, who
prey upon carcaſſes, and root up the dead.</p>
               <p>Vultures may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from all thoſe of
the eagle kind, by the nakedneſs of their heads and necks, which are without
fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and only covered with a very ſlight down, or a few ſcattered
hairs. Their eyes are more <pb facs="tcp:0823900105:129"/>

prominent; thoſe of the eagle being buried more in the ſocket. Their claws
are ſhorter, and leſs hooked. The inſide of the wing is covered with a
thick down, which is different in them from all other birds of prey. Their
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is not ſo upright as that of the eagle; and their flight more
difficult and heavy.</p>
               <p>In this tribe we may range the golden, the aſh-coloured, and
the brown vulture, which are inhabitants of Europe; the ſpotted, and the
black vulture of Egypt; the bearded vulture; the Braſilian vulture, and the
king of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of South America. They all agree in their nature; being
equally indolent, yet rapacious and unclean.</p>
               <p>The Golden Vulture ſeems to be the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the kind;
and is in many things like the golden eagle, but larger in every proportion.
From the end of the beak, to that of the tail, it is four feet and an half; and
to the claws end, forty-five inches. The length of the upper mandible is
almoſt ſeven inches; and the tail twenty-ſeven in length. The lower part
of the neck, breaſt and belly, are of a red colour; but on the tail it is
more faint, and deeper near the head. The feathers are black on the back; and
on the wings and tail, of a yellowiſh brown. Others of the kind differ from
this in colour and <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0823900105:132"/> dimenſions; but they are all
ſtronly marked by their naked heads, and beak ſtraight in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
but hooking at the point.</p>
               <p>They are ſtill more ſtrongly marked by their nature, which,
as has been obſerved, is cruel, unclean, and indolent. Their ſenſe of
ſmelling, however, is amazingly great; and Nature, for this purpoſe, has
given them two large apertures or noſtrils without, and an extenſive
olfactory membrane within. Their inteſtines are formed differently from
thoſe of the eagle kind; for they partake more of the formation of ſuch
birds as live upon grain. They have both a crop and a ſtomach; which may be
regarded as a kind of gizzard, from the extreme thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the muſcles
of which it is compoſed. In fact, they ſeem adapted inwardly, not only for
being carnivorous, but to eat corn, or whatſoever of that kind comes in their
way.</p>
               <p>This bird, which is common in many parts of Europe, and but too
well known on the weſtern continent, is totally unknown in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. In
Egypt, Arabia, and many other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Africa and Aſia, vultures are
found in great abundance. The inſide down of their wing is converted into a
very warm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable kind of fur, and is commonly ſold in the Aſiatic
markets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0823900105:133"/>Indeed, in Egypt, this bird ſeems to be
of ſingular ſervice. There are great flocks of them in the neighbourhood of
Grand Cairo, which no perſon is permitted to deſtroy. The ſervice they
render the inhabitants, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring all the carrion and filth of that
great city; which might otherwiſe tend to corrupt and putrify the air. They
are commonly ſeen in company with the wild dogs of the country, tearing a
carcaſs very deliberately together. This odd aſſociation produces no
quarrels; the birds and quadrupedes ſeem to live amicably, and nothing but
harmony ſubſiſts between them. The wonder is ſtill the greater, as both
are extremely rapacious, and both lean and bony to a very great degree;
probably having no great plenty even of the wretched food on which they
ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>In America, they lead a life ſomewhat ſimilar. Wherever the
hunters, who there only purſue beaſts for the ſkins, are found to go,
theſe birds are ſeen to purſue them. They ſtill keep hovering at a
little diſtance; and when they ſee the beaſt flead and abandoned, they
call out to each other, pour down upon the carcaſs, and, in an inſtant,
pick its bones as bare and clean as if they had been ſcraped by a knife.</p>
               <p>At the Cape of Good Hope, in Africa, they <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0823900105:134"/>
ſeem to diſcover a ſtill greater ſhare of dexterity in their methods of
carving. 
<q rend="inline">"I have," ſays Kolben, "been often a
ſpectator of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they have anatomized a dead body: I ſay
anatomized, for no artiſt in the world could have done it more cleanly. They
have a wonderful method of ſeparating the fleſh from the bones, and yet
leaving the ſkin quite entire. Upon coming near the carcaſs, one would not
ſuppoſe it thus deprived of its internal ſubſtance, till he began to
examine it more cloſely; he then finds it, literally ſpeaking, nothing but
ſkin and bone. Their manner of performing the operation, is this: they
firſt make an opening in the belly of the animal, from whence they pluck out
and greedily devour the entrails; then entering into the hollow which they have
made, they ſeparate the fleſh from the bones, without ever touching the
ſkin. It often happens that an ox returning home alone to its ſtall from
the plow, lies down by the way: it is then, if the vultures perceive it, that
they fall with fury down, and inevitably devour the unfortunate animal. They
ſometimes attempt them grazing in the fields; and then, to the number of a
hundred, or more, make their attack all at once and together."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0823900105:135"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">"They are attracted by carrion," ſays
Cateſby, "from a very great diſtance. It is pleaſant to behold them, when
they are thus eating, and diſputing for their prey. An eagle generally
preſides at theſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and makes them all keep their diſtance
till he has done. They then fall too with an excellent appetite: and their
ſenſe of ſmelling is ſo exquiſite, that the inſtant a carcaſs
drops, we may ſee the vultures floating in the air from all quarters, and
come ſouſing on their prey."</q> It is ſuppoſed by ſome, that they
eat nothing that has life; but this is only when they are not able: for when
they can come at lambs, they ſhew no mercy; and ſerpents are their ordinary
food. The manner of thoſe birds is to perch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeveral
together, on the old pine and cypreſs-trees; where they continue all the
morning, for ſeveral hours, with their wings unfolded: nor are they fearful
of danger, but ſuffer people to approach them very near, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when
they are eating.</p>
               <p>The ſloth, the filth, and the voraciouſneſs of theſe
birds, almoſt exceed credibility. In the Brazils, where they are found in
great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, when they light upon a carcaſs, which they have liberty to
tear at their eaſe, they ſo <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0823900105:136"/> gorge themſelves, that
they are unable to fly; but keep hopping along when they are purſued. At all
times, they are a bird of ſlow flight, and unable readily to raiſe
themſelves from the ground; but when they have over-fed, they are then
utterly helpleſs: but they ſoon get rid of their burthen; for they have a
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of vomiting up what they have eaten, and then they fly off with greater
facility.</p>
               <p>It is pleaſant, however, to be a ſpectator of the
hoſtilities between animals that are thus hateful or noxious. Of all
creatures, the two moſt at enmity, is the vulture of Brazil, and the
crocodile. The female of this terrible am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibious creature, which in the
rivers of that part of the world grows to the ſize of twenty-ſeven feet,
lays it eggs, to the number of one or two hundred, in the ſands, on the
ſide of the river, where they are hatched by the heat of the climate. For
this purpoſe, ſhe takes every precaution to hide from all other animals the
place where ſhe depoſes her burthen: in the mean time, a number of
vultures, or galinaſſos, as the Spaniards call them, ſit, ſilent and
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, in the branches of ſome neighbouring foreſt, and view the
crocodile's operations, with the pleaſing expectations of ſucceeding
plunder. They patiently wait till the crocodile <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0823900105:137"/> has laid
the whole number of her eggs, till ſhe has covered them carefully under the
ſand, and until ſhe is retired from them to a convenient diſtance. Then,
all together, encouraging each other with cries, they pour down upon the
neſt, hook up the ſand in a moment, lay the eggs bare, and devour the whole
brood without remorſe. Wretched as is the fleſh of theſe animals, yet
men, perhaps when preſſed by hunger, have been tempted to taſte it.
No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more lean, ſtringy, nauſeous, and unſavory. It is in vain
that, when killed, the rump has been cut off; in vain the body has been
waſhed, and ſpices uſed to overpower its prevailing odour; it ſtill
ſmells and taſtes of the carrion by which it was nouriſhed, and ſends
forth a ſtench that is inſupportable.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds, at leaſt thoſe of Europe, uſually lay two
eggs at a time, and produce but once a year. They make their neſts in
inacceſſible cliffs, and in places ſo remote that it is rare to find
them. Thoſe in our part of the world, chiefly reſide in the places where
they breed, and ſeldom come down into the plains, except when the ſnow and
ice, in their native retreats, has baniſhed all living animals but
themſelves: they then come from their heights, and brave the perils they
muſt encounter in a more cultivated <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0823900105:138"/> region. As carrion
is not found, at thoſe ſeaſons, in ſufficient quantity, or
ſufficiently remote from man to ſuſtain them, they prey upon rabbits,
hares, ſerpents, and whatever ſmall game they can overtake or
overpower.</p>
               <p>Such are the manners of this bird in general; but there is one
of the kind, called the King of the Vultures, which, from its extraordinary
figure, deſerves a ſeparate deſcription. This bird is a native of
America, and not of the Eaſt Indies, as thoſe who make a trade of ſhewing
birds would induce us to believe. This bird is larger than a turkey-cock; but
is cheifly remarkable for the odd formation of the ſkin of the head and neck,
which is bare. This ſkin ariſes from the baſe of the bill, and is of an
orange colour; from whence it ſtretches on each ſide to the head: from
thence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, like an indented comb, and falls on either ſide,
according to the motion of the head. The eyes are ſurrounded by a red ſkin,
of a ſcarlet colour; and the iris has the colour and luſtre of pearl. The
head and neck are without feathers, covered with a fleſh-coloured ſkin on
the upper part, a fine ſcarlet behind the head, and a duſkier coloured
ſkin before: farther down behind the head, ariſes a little tuft of black
down, from whence iſſues and extends beneath <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0823900105:139"/> the
throat, on each ſide, a wrinkled ſkin, of a browniſh colour, mixed with
blue, and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh behind: below, upon the naked part of the neck, is a
collar, formed by ſoft longiſh feathers, of a deep aſh colour, which
ſurround the neck, and cover the breaſt before. Into this collar the bird
ſometimes withdraws its whole neck, and ſometimes a part of its head; ſo
that it looks as if it had withdrawn the neck into the body. Thoſe marks are
ſufficient to diſtinguiſh this bird from all others of the vulture kind;
and it cannot be doubted, but that it is the moſt beautiful of all this
deformed family: however, neither its habits nor inſtincts vary from the
reſt of the tribe; being, like them, a ſlow cowardly bird, living chiefly
upon rats, lizards, and ſerpents; and upon carrion or excrement, when it
happens in the way. The fleſh is ſo bad, that even ſavages themſelves
cannot abide it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. Of the Falcon Kind and its Affinities.</head>
               <p>EVERY creature becomes more important in the hiſtory of nature
in proportion as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with man. In this view, the ſmalleſt
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, or the moſt ſeemingly contemptible inſect, is a ſubject
more deſerving attention than the moſt flouriſhing tree or the moſt
beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of the feathered creation. In this view, the falcon is a more
important animal than the eagle or the vulture; and, though ſo very
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive in the compariſon, is notwithſtanding, from its connexion with
our pleaſures, a much more intereſting object of curioſity.</p>
               <p>The amuſement of hawking, indeed, is now pretty much given
over in this kingdom; for, as every country refines, as its encloſures become
higher and cloſer, thoſe rural ſports muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently decline, in
which the game is to be purſued over a long extent of country, and where,
while every thing retards the purſuer below, nothing can ſtop the object of
his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit above.</p>
               <p>Falconry, that is now ſo much diſuſed among us, was the
principal amuſement of our <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0823900105:141"/> anceſtors. A perſon of
rank ſcarce ſtirred out without his hawk on his hand; which in old
paintings is the criterion of nobility. Harold, afterwards king of England,
when he went on a moſt important embaſſy into Normandy, is drawn in an
old bas-relief, as embarking with a bird on his fiſt and a dog under his arm.
In thoſe days, it was thought ſufficient for noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's ſons to wind the
horn, and to carry their hawk fair, and leave ſtudy and learning to the
children of meaner people. Indeed, this diverſion was in ſuch high eſteem
among the great all over Europe, that Frederic, one of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of
Germany, thought it not beneath him to write a treatiſe upon hawking.</p>
               <p>The expence which attended this ſport was very great: among
the old Welch princes, the king's falconer was the fourth officer in the
ſtate; but, notwithſtanding all his honours, he was forbid to take more
than three draughts of beer from his horn, leſt he ſhould get drunk and
neglect his duty. In the reign of James the Firſt, Sir Thomas Monſon is
ſaid to have given a thouſand pounds for a caſt of hawks; and ſuch was
their value in general, that it was made felony in the reign of Edward the
Third to ſteal a hawk. To take its eggs, even in a perſon's own ground, was
puniſhable with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0823900105:142"/> for a year and a day,
together with a fine at the king's pleaſure. In the reign of Elizabeth, the
impriſonment was reduced to three months; but the offender was to lie in
priſon till he got ſecurity for his good behaviour for ſeven years
farther. In the earlier times, the art of gunning was but little practiſed,
and the hawk then was valuable, not only for its affording diverſion, but for
its procuring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies for the table that could ſeldom be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any
other way.</p>
               <p>Of many of the ancient falcons uſed for this purpoſe, we at
this time know only the names, as the exact ſpecies are ſo ill deſcribed,
that one may be very eaſily miſtaken for another. Of thoſe in uſe at
preſent, both here and in other countries, are the gyr-falcon, the falcon,
the lanner, the ſacre, the hobby, the keſtril, and the merlin. Theſe are
called the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winged hawks, to diſtinguiſh them from the goſs-hawk, the
ſparrow hawk, the kite, and the buzzard, that are of ſhorter wing, and
either too ſlow, too cowardly, too indolent, or too obſtinate, to be
ſerviceable in contributing to the pleaſures of the field.</p>
               <p>The generous tribe of hawks, as was ſaid, are
diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by the peculiar length of their wings, which
reach nearly as low <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0823900105:143"/> as the tail. In theſe, the firſt
quill of the wing is nearly as long as the ſecond; it terminates in a point
which begins to diminiſh from about an inch of its extremity. This
ſufficiently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the generous breed from that of the baſer
race of kites, ſparrow-hawks, and buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, in whom the tail is longer than
the wings, and the firſt feather of the wing is rounded at the extremity.
They differ alſo in the latter having the fourth feather of the wing the
longeſt; in the generous race it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſecond.</p>
               <p>This generous race, which have been taken into the ſervice of
man, are endowed with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural powers that the other kinds are not
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of. From the length of their wings, they are ſwifter to
purſue their game; from a confidence in this ſwiftneſs, they are bolder
to attack it; and, from an innate generoſity, they have an attachment to
their feeder, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a docility which the baſer birds are
ſtrangers to.</p>
               <p>The gyr-falcon leads in this bold train. He exceeds all other
falcons in the largeneſs of his ſize, for he approaches nearly to the
mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the eagle. The top of the head is flat and of an aſh colour,
with a ſtrong, thick, ſhort, and blue beak. The feathers of the back 
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0823900105:144"/> and wings are marked with black ſpots, in the ſhape
of an heart; he is a courageous and fierce bird, nor fears even the eagle
himſelf; but he chiefly flies at the ſtork, the heron, and the crane. He is
moſtly found in the colder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the north, but loſes neither his
ſtrength nor his courage when brought into the milder climates.</p>
               <p>The falcon, properly ſo called, is the ſecond in magnitude
and fame. There are ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties in this bird; but there ſeem to be only
two that claim diſtinction; the falcon gentil and the peregrine faulcon; both
are much leſs than the gyr, and ſomewhat about the ſize of a raven. They
differ but ſlightly, and perhaps only from the different ſtates they were
in when brought into captivity. Thoſe differences are eaſier known by
experience than taught by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. The falcon gentil moults in March,
and often ſooner; the peregrine falcon does not moult till the middle of
Auguſt. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine is ſtronger in the ſhoulder, has a larger eye, and
yet more ſunk in the head; his beak is ſtronger, his legs longer, and the
toes better divided.</p>
               <p>Next in ſize to theſe is the lanner, a bird now very little
known in Europe; then follows the ſacre, the legs of which are of a 
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0823900105:145"/> bluiſh colour, and ſerve to diſtinguiſh that
bird; to them ſucceeds the hobby, uſed for ſmaller game, for daring
larks, and ſtooping at quails. The keſtril was trained for the ſame
purpoſes; and laſtly the merlin; which though the ſmalleſt of all the
hawk or falcon kind, and not much larger than a thruſh, yet diſplays a
degree of courage that renders him formidable even to birds ten times his
ſize. He has often been known to kill a partridge or a quail at a ſingle
pounce from above.</p>
               <p>Some of the other ſpecies of ſluggiſh birds were now and
then trained to this ſport, but it was when no better could be obtained; but
theſe juſt deſcribed were only conſidered as birds of the nobler races.
Their courage in general was ſuch, that no bird, not very much above their
own ſize, could terrify them; their ſwiftneſs ſo great, that ſcarce
any bird could eſcape them; and their docility ſo remarkable, that they
obeyed not only the commands, but the ſigns of their maſter. They remained
quietly perched upon his hand till their game was fluſhed, or elſe kept
hovering round his head, without ever leaving him but when he gave
permiſſion. The common falcon is a bird of ſuch ſpirit, that, like a
conqueror in a country, he keeps all birds in awe and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0823900105:146"/> to his prowſe. Where he is ſeen flying wild, as I
often had an opportunity of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the birds of every kind, that
ſeemed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to diſregard the kite or the ſparrow-hawk, fly with
ſcreams at his moſt diſtant appearance. Long before I could ſee the
falcon, I have ſeen them with the utmoſt ſigns of terror en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to
avoid him; and, like the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants of a country before a victorious army,
every one of them attempting to ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Even the young falcons,
though their ſpirit be depreſſed by captivity, will, when brought out
into the field, venture to fly at barnacles and wild geeſe, till, being
ſoundly bruſhed and beaten by thoſe ſtrong birds, they learn their
error, and deſiſt from meddling with ſuch unwieldy game for the
future.</p>
               <p>To train up the hawk to this kind of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſo as to hunt
for his maſter, and bring him the game he ſhall kill, requires no ſmall
degree of ſkill and aſſiduity. Numberleſs trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes have been
written upon this ſubject, which are now, with the ſport itſelf, almoſt
utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: indeed, except to a few, they ſeem utterly
unintelligible; for the falconers had a language peculiar to themſelves, in
which they converſed and wrote, and took a kind of profeſſional pride in
uſing no other. A modern reader, I ſuppoſe, would be little edified by
one of the <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0823900105:147"/> inſtructions, for inſtance, which we find
in Willoughby, when he bids us 
<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>draw our falcon out of the mew twenty days
before we enſeam her. If ſhe truſs and carry, the remedy is, to coſſe
her talons, her powſe, and petty ſingle.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But, as it certainly makes a part of natural hiſtory to ſhew
how much the nature of birds can be wrought upon by harſh or kind treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I will juſt take leave to give a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the manner of training
an hawk, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of thoſe cant words with which men of art have thought
proper to obſcure their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>In order to train up a falcon, the maſter begins by clapping
on ſtraps upon his legs, which are called jeſſes, to which there is
faſtened a ring with the owner's name, by which, in caſe he ſhould be
loſt, the finder may know where to bring him back. To theſe alſo are
added little bells, which ſerve to mark the place where he is, if loſt in
the chace. He is always carried on the fiſt, and is obliged to keep without
ſleeping. If he be ſtubborn, and attempts to bite, his head is plunged into
water. Thus, by hunger, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fatigue, he is conſtrained to ſubmit
to having his head covered by a hood or cowl, which covers his eyes. This
troubleſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment continues often for three days and 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0823900105:148"/> nights without ceaſing. It rarely happens but at the
end of this his neceſſities, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of light, make him loſe
all idea of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and bring down his natural wildneſs. His maſter
judges of his being tamed when he permits his head to be covered without
reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and when uncovered he ſeizes the meat before him
contentedly. The repetition of theſe leſſons by degrees enſures
ſucceſs. His wants being the chief principle of his depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it is
endeavoured to encreaſe his appetite by giving him little balls of flannel,
which he greedily ſwallows. Having thus excited the appetite, care is taken
to ſatisfy it; and thus gratitude attaches the bird to the man who but juſt
before had been his tormentor.</p>
               <p>When the firſt leſſons have ſucceeded, and the bird
ſhews ſigns of docility, he is carried out upon ſome green, the head is
uncovered, and, by flattering him with food at different times, he is taught to
jump on the fiſt, and to continue there. When confirmed in this habit, it is
then thought time to make him acquainted with the lure. This lure is only a
thing ſtuffed like the bird the falcon is deſigned to purſue, ſuch as
an heron, a pidgeon, or a quail, and on this lure they always take care to give
him his food. It is quite neceſſary that the bird ſhould 
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0823900105:149"/> not only be acquainted with this but fond of it, and
delicate in his food when ſhewn it. When the falcon has flown upon this, and
taſted the firſt morſel, ſome falconers then take it away; but by this
there is a danger of daunting the bird; and the ſureſt method is, when he
flies to ſeize it to let him feed at large, and this ſerves as a recompence
for his docility. The uſe of this lure is to flatter him back when he has
flown in the air, which it ſometimes fails to do; and it is always
requiſite to aſſiſt it by the voice and the ſigns of the maſter.
When theſe leſſons have been long repeated, it is then neceſſary to
ſtudy the character of the bird; to ſpeak fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to him if he be
inattentive to the voice; to ſtint in his food ſuch as do not come kindly
or readily to the lure; to keep waking him if he be not ſufficiently
familiar; and to cover him frequently with the hood if he fears darkneſs.
When the familiarity and the docility of the bird are ſufficiently confirmed
on the green, he is then carried into the open fields, but ſtill kept faſt
by a ſtring which is about twenty yards long. He is then uncovered as before;
and the falconer, calling him at ſome paces diſtance, ſhews him the lure.
When he flies upon it he is permitted to take a large morſel of the food
which is tied to it. The next day the lure is ſhewn him at 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0823900105:150"/> a greater diſtance, till he comes at laſt to fly to
it at the utmoſt length of his ſtring. He is then to be ſhewn the game
itſelf alive, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled or tame, which he is deſigned to purſue.
After having ſeized this ſeveral times with his ſtring, he is then left
entirely at liberty, and carried into the field for the purpoſes of
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing that which is wild. At that he flies with avidity; and when he has
ſeized it, or killed it, he is brought back by the voice and the lure.</p>
               <p>By this method of inſtruction, an hawk may be taught to fly at
any game whatſoever; but falconers have chiefly confined their purſuit only
to ſuch animals as yield them profit by the capture or pleaſure in the
purſuit. The hare, the partridge, and the quail, repay the trouble of taking
them; but the moſt delightful ſport is the falcon's purſuit of the heron,
the kite, or the wood-lark. Inſtead of flying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly forward, as ſome
other birds do, theſe, when they ſee themſelves threatened by the
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the hawk, immediately take to the ſkies. They fly almoſt
perpendicularly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, while their ardent purſuer keeps pace with their
flight, and tries to riſe above them. Thus both diminiſh by degrees from
the gazing ſpectator below, till they are quite loſt in the clouds; but
they are ſoon ſeen deſcending, <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0823900105:151"/> ſtruggling
together, and uſing every effort on both ſides; the one of rapacious
inſult, the other of deſperate defence. The unequal combat is ſoon at an
end; the falcon comes off victorious, and the other, killed or diſabled, is
made a prey either to the bird or the ſportſman.</p>
               <p>As for other birds, they are not ſo much pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, as they
generally fly ſtraight forward, by which the ſportſman loſes ſight of
the chace, and, what is ſtill worſe, runs a chance of loſing his falcon
alſo. The purſuit of the lark by a couple of merlins is conſidered, to
him only who regards the ſagacity of the chace, as one of the moſt
delightful ſpectacles this exerciſe can afford. The amuſement is, to
ſee one of the merlins climbing to get the aſcendant of the lark, while the
other, lying low for the beſt advantage, waits the ſucceſs of its
companion's efforts; thus while the one ſtoops to ſtrike its prey, the
other ſeizes it at its coming down.</p>
               <p>Such is the natural and acquired habits of theſe birds, which
of all others have the greateſt ſtrength and courage relative to their
ſize. While the kite or the goſs-hawk approach their prey ſide-ways,
theſe dart perpendicularly, in their wild ſtate, upon their game, and
devour it on the ſpot, or carry it off, if not too large for their power of
flying. They are ſometimes <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0823900105:152"/> ſeen deſcending
perpendicularly from the clouds, from an amazing height, and darting down on
their prey with inevitable ſwiftneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>The more ignoble race of birds make up by cunning and
aſſiduity what theſe claim by force and celerity. Being leſs
courageous, they are more patient; and, having leſs ſwiftneſs, they are
better ſkilled at taking their prey by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. The kite, that may be
diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt of this tribe by his forky tail and his
ſlow floating motion, ſeems almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever upon the wing. He appears to
reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the boſom of the air, and not to make the ſmalleſt
effort in flying. He lives only upon accidental carnage, as almoſt every bird
in the air is able to make good its retreat againſt him. He may be therefore
conſidered as an inſiduous thief who only prowls about and, when he finds a
ſmall bird wounded, or a young chicken ſtrayed too far from the mother,
inſtantly ſeizes the hour of calamity, and, like a famiſhed glutton, is
ſure to ſhew no mercy. His hunger, indeed, often urges him to acts of
ſeeming deſperation. I have ſeen one of them fly round and round for a
while to mark a clutch of chickens, and then on a ſudden dart like lightning
upon the unreſiſting little <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0823900105:153"/> animal, and carry it
off, the hen in vain crying out, and the boys hooting and caſting ſtones to
ſcare it from its plunder. For this reaſon, of all birds the kite is the
good houſewife's greateſt tormentor and averſion.</p>
               <p>Of all obſcene birds, the kite is the beſt known; but the
buzzard among us is the moſt plenty. He is a ſluggiſh inactive bird, and
often remains perched whole days together upon the ſame bough. He is rather
an aſſaſſin than a purſuer; and lives more upon frogs, mice, and
inſects, which he can eaſily ſeize, than upon birds which he is obliged
to follow. He lives in ſummer by robbing the neſts of other birds, and
ſucking their eggs, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the owl kind in his countenance
than any other rapacious bird of day. His figure implies the ſtupidity of his
diſpoſition; and ſo little is he capable of inſtruction from man, that
it is common to a proverb to call one who cannot be taught, or continues
obſtinately ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, a buzzard. The honey-buzzard, the moor-buzzard, and
the hen-harrier, are all of this ſtupid tribe, and differ chiefly in their
ſize, growing leſs in the order I have named them. The goſs-hawk and
ſparrow hawk are what Mr. Willoughby calls ſhort winged birds, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently unfit for training, however injurious <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0823900105:154"/>
they may be to the pidgeon-houſe or the ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. They have been indeed
taught to fly at game; but little is to be obtained from their efforts, being
difficult of inſtruction and capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in their obedience. It has been
lately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, however, by one whoſe authority is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable, that
the ſparrow-hawk is the boldeſt and the beſt of all others for the
pleaſure of the chace.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. The Butcher-Bird.</head>
               <p>BEFORE I conclude this ſhort hiſtory of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious birds
that prey by day, I muſt take leave to deſcribe a tribe of ſmaller birds,
that ſeem from their ſize rather to be claſſed with the harmleſs
order of the ſparrow-kind; but that from their crooked beak, courage, and
appetites for ſlaughter, certainly deſerve a place here. The leſſer
butcher-bird is not much above the ſize of a lark; that of the ſmalleſt
ſpecies is not ſo big as a ſparrow; yet, diminutive as theſe little
animals are, they make themſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to birds of four times their
dimenſions.</p>
               <p>The greater butcher bird is about as large as a thruſh; its
bill is black, an inch long, and hooked at the end. This mark, together with
its carnivorous appetites, ranks it among the rapacious birds; at the ſame
time that its legs and feet, which are ſlender, and its toes, formed
ſomewhat differently from the former, would ſeem to make it the ſhade
between ſuch birds as live wholly upon fleſh, and ſuch as live chiefly
upon inſects and grain.</p>
               <p>Indeed, its habits ſeem entirely to correſpond 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0823900105:156"/> with its conformation, as it is found to live as well
upon fleſh as upon inſects, and thus to partake in ſome meaſure of a
double nature. However, its appetite for fleſh is the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent; and
it never takes up with the former when it can obtain the latter. This bird,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leads a life of continual combat and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. As from its
ſize it does not much terrify the ſmaller birds of the foreſt, ſo it
very frequently meets birds willing to try its ſtrength, and it never
declines the engagement.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful to ſee with what intrepidity this little
creature goes to war with the pie, the crow, and the keſtril, all above four
times bigger than itſelf, and that ſometimes prey upon fleſh in the
ſame manner. It not only fights upon the defenſive, but often comes to the
attack, and always with advantage, particularly when the male and female unite
to protect their young, and to drive away the more powerful birds of rapine. At
that ſeaſon, they do not wait the approach of their invader; it is
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that they ſee him preparing for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault at a
diſtance. It is then that they ſally forth with loud cries, wound him on
every ſide, and drive him off with ſuch fury, that he ſeldom ventures to
return to the charge. In theſe kinds of diſputes, they generally come off
with <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0823900105:157"/> the victory; though it ſometimes happens that
they fall to the ground with the bird they have ſo fiercely fixed upon, and
the combat ends with the deſtruction of the aſſailant as well as the
defender.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon, the moſt redoubtable birds of prey
reſpect them; while the kite, the buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and the crow, ſeems rather to
fear than ſeek the engagement. Nothing in nature better diſplays the
reſpect paid to the claims of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, than to ſee this little bird,
apparently ſo contemptible, fly in company with the lanner, the falcon, and
all the tyrants of the air, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fearing their power, or avoiding their
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.</p>
               <p>As for ſmall birds, they are its uſual food. It ſeizes
them by the throat, and ſtrangles them in an inſtant. When it has thus
killed the bird or inſect, it is aſſerted by the beſt authority, that
it fixes them upon ſome neighbouring thorn, and, when thus ſpitted, pulls
them to pieces with its bill. It is ſuppoſed that as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has not given
this bird ſtrength ſufficient to tear its prey to pieces with its feet, as
the hawks do, it is obliged to have recourſe to this extraordinary
expedient.</p>
               <p>During ſummer, ſuch of them as conſtantly reſide here,
for the ſmaller red butcher-bird migrates, remain among the mountainous parts
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0823900105:158"/> of the country; but in winter they deſcend into the
plains and nearer human habitations. The larger kind make their neſts on the
higheſt trees, while the leſſer build in buſhes in the fields and
hedge-rows. They both lay about ſix eggs, of a white colour, but encircled at
the bigger end with a ring of browniſh red. The neſt on the outſide is
compoſed of white moſs, interwoven with long graſs; within, it is well
lined with wool, and is uſually fixed among the forking branches of a tree.
The female feeds her young with caterpillars and other inſects while very
young; but ſoon after accuſtoms them to fleſh, which the male procures
with ſurprizing induſtry. Their nature alſo is very different from other
birds of prey in their parental care; for, ſo far from driving out their
young from the neſt to ſhift for themſelves, they keep them with care;
and even when adult they do not forſake them, but the whole brood live in one
family together. Each family lives apart, and is generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the
male, female, and five or ſix young ones; theſe all maintain peace and
ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among each other, and hunt in concert. Upon the returning
ſeaſon of courtſhip this union is at an end, the family parts for ever,
each to eſtabliſh a little houſehold of its own. It is eaſy to
diſtinguiſh theſe birds at a diſtance, <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0823900105:159"/> not only
from their going in companies, but alſo from their manner of flying, which is
always up and down, ſeldom direct or ſide-ways.</p>
               <p>Of theſe birds there are three or four different kinds; but
the greater aſh-coloured butcher-bird is the leaſt known among us. The red
backed butcher-bird migrates in autumn, and does not return till ſpring. The
woodchat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the former except in the colour of the back, which is
brown and not red as in the other. There is ſtill another, leſs than either
of the former, found in the marſhes near London. This too is a bird of prey,
although not much bigger than a tit-mouſe; an evident proof that an animal's
courage or rapacity does not depend upon its ſize. Of foreign birds of this
kind there are ſeveral; but as we know little of their manner of living, we
will not, inſtead of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, ſubſtitute mere deſcription. In fact,
the colours of a bird, which is all we know of them, would afford a reader but
ſmall entertainment in the enumeration. Nothing can be more eaſy than to
fill volumes with the different ſhades of a bird's plumage; but theſe
accounts are written with more pleaſure than they are read; and a ſingle
glance of a good plate or a picture imprints a juſter idea than a volume
could convey.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Of Rapacious Birds of the Owl Kind that prey by
Night.</head>
               <p>HITHERTO we have been deſcribing a tribe of animals who,
though plunderers among their fellows of the air, yet wage war boldly in the
face of day. We now come to a race equally cruel and rapacious; but who add to
their ſavage diſpoſition, the further reproach of treachery, and carry on
all their depredations by night.</p>
               <p>All birds of the owl kind may be conſidered as nocturnal
robbers, who, unfitted for taking their prey while it is light, ſurprize it
at thoſe hours of reſt when the tribes of Nature are in the leaſt
expectation of an enemy. Thus there ſeems no link in Nature's chain broken;
no where a dead inactive repoſe; but every place, every ſeaſon, every
hour of the day and night, is buſtling with life, and furniſhing
inſtances of induſtry, ſelf-defence, and invaſion.</p>
               <p>All birds of the owl kind have one common mark, by which they
are diſtinguiſhed from others; their eyes are formed for ſeeing better in
the duſk, than in the broad glare of ſun-ſhine. As in the eyes of tigers
and cats, that are formed <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0823900105:161"/> for a life of nocturnal
depredation, there is a quality in the retina that takes in the rays of light
ſo copiouſly as to permit their ſeeing in places almoſt quite dark;
ſo in theſe birds there is the ſame conformation of that organ, and
though, like us, they cannot ſee in a total ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of light, yet they
are ſufficiently quick-ſighted, at times when we remain in total
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. In the eyes of all animals Nature hath made a complete
proviſion, either to ſhut out too much light, or to admit a ſufficiency,
by the contraction and dilatation of the pupil. In theſe birds the pupil is
capable of opening very wide, or ſhutting very cloſe: by contracting the
pupil, the brighter light of the day, which would act too powerfully upon the
ſenſibility of the retina, is excluded; by dilating the pupil, the animal
takes in the more faint rays of the night, and thereby is enabled to ſpy its
prey, and catch it with greater facility in the dark. Beſide this, there is
an irradiation on the back of the eye, and the very iris itſelf has a faculty
of reflecting the rays of light, ſo as to aſſiſt viſion in the gloomy
places where theſe birds are found to frequent.</p>
               <p>But though owls are dazzled by too bright a day-light, yet they
do not ſee beſt in the darkeſt nights, as ſome have been apt to
imagine. It is in the duſk of the evening, or the grey of 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0823900105:162"/> the morning, that they are beſt fitted for ſeeing;
at thoſe ſeaſons when there is neither too much light, nor too little. It
is then that they iſſue from their retreats, to hunt or to ſurprize their
prey, which is uſually attended with great ſucceſs: it is then that they
find all other birds aſleep, or preparing for repoſe, and they have only to
ſeize the moſt unguarded.</p>
               <p>The nights when the moon ſhines are the times of their moſt
ſucceſsful plunder; for when it is wholly dark, they are leſs qualified
for ſeeing and purſuing their prey: except, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by moonlight, they
contract the hours of their chace; and if they come out at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of
duſk in the evening, they return before it is totally dark, and then riſe
by twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the next morning to purſue their game, and to return, in like
manner, before the broad day-light begins to dazzle them with its
ſplendor.</p>
               <p>Yet the faculty of ſeeing in the night, or of being entirely
dazzled by day, is not alike in every ſpecies of theſe nocturnal birds:
ſome ſee by night better than others; and ſome are ſo little dazzled by
day-light, that they perceive their enemies and avoid them. The common White or
Barn Owl, for inſtance, ſees with ſuch exquiſite acuteneſs in the
dark, that though the barn has been ſhut at night, and the light 
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0823900105:163"/> thus totally excluded, yet it perceives the ſmalleſt
mouſe that peeps from its hole: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Brown Horn Owl is often
ſeen to prowl along the hedges by day, like the ſparrow-hawk; and
ſometimes with good ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>All birds of the owl kind may be divided into two ſorts;
thoſe that have horns, and thoſe without. Theſe horns are nothing more
than two or three feathers that ſtand up on each ſide of the head over the
ear, and give this animal a kind of horned appearance. Of the horned kind is,
the Great Horned Owl, which at firſt view appears as large as an eagle. When
he comes to be obſerved more cloſely, however, he will be found much
leſs. His legs, body, wings and tail, are ſhorter; his head much larger and
thicker: his horns are compoſed of feathers, that riſe above two inches and
an half high, and which he can erect or depreſs at pleaſure: his eyes are
large and tranſparent, encircled with an orange-coloured iris: his ears are
large and deep, and it would appear that no animal was poſſeſſed with a
more exquiſite ſenſe of hearing: his plumage is of a reddiſh brown,
marked on the back with black and yellow ſpots, and yellow only upon the
belly.</p>
               <p>Next to this is the Common Horned Owl, of a much ſmaller
ſize than the former, and with <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0823900105:164"/> horns much ſhorter.
As the great owl was five feet from the tip of one wing to the other, this is
but three. The horns are but about an inch long, and conſiſt of ſix
feathers, variegated with black and yellow.</p>
               <p>There is ſtill a ſmaller kind of the horned owl, which is
not much larger than a black-bird; and whoſe horns are remarkably ſhort,
being compoſed but of one feather, and that not above half an inch high.</p>
               <p>To theſe ſucceeds the tribe without horns. The Howlet, which
is the largeſt of this kind, with duſky plumes, and black eyes; the Screech
Owl, of a ſmaller ſize, with blue eyes, and plumage of an iron grey; the
White Owl, about as large as the former, with yellow eyes and whitiſh
plumage; the Great Brown Owl, leſs than the former, with brown plumage and a
brown beak; and laſtly, the Little Brown Owl, with yellowiſh coloured eyes,
and an orange-coloured bill. To this catalogue might be added others of foreign
denominations, which differ but little from our own, if we except the Harfang,
or Great Hudſon's Bay Owl of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which is the largeſt of all the
nocturnal tribe, and as white as the ſnows of the country of which he is a
native.</p>
               <p>All this tribe of animals, however they may differ in their
ſize and plumage, agree in their <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0823900105:165"/> general
characteriſtics of preying by night, and having their eyes formed for
nocturnal viſion. Their bodies are ſtrong and muſcular; their feet and
claws made for tearing their prey; and their ſtomachs for digeſting it. It
muſt be remarked, however, that the digeſtion of all birds that live upon
mice, lizards, or ſuch like food, is not very perfect; for though they
ſwallow them whole, yet they are always ſeen ſome time after to
diſgorge the ſkin and bones, rolled up in a pellet, as being
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtible.</p>
               <p>In proportion as each of theſe animals bears the day-light
beſt, he ſets forward earlier in the evening in purſuit of his prey. The
great horned owl is the foremoſt in leaving his retreat; and ventures into
the woods and thickets very ſoon in the evening. The horned, and the brown
owl, are later in their excurſions: but the barn owl ſeems to ſee beſt
in profound dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſeldom leaves his hiding-place till
midnight.</p>
               <p>As they are incapable of ſupporting the light of the day, or
at leaſt of then ſeeing and readily avoiding their danger, they keep all
this time concealed in ſome obſcure retreat, ſuited to their gloomy
appetites, and there continue in ſolitude and ſilence. The cavern of a
rock, the darkeſt part of an hollow tree, the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments 
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0823900105:166"/> of a ruined and unfrequented caſtle, ſome obſcure
hole in a farmer's out-houſe, are the places where they are uſually found:
if they be ſeen out of theſe retreats in the day-time, they may be
conſidered as having loſt their way; as having by ſome accident been
thrown into the midſt of their enemies, and ſurrounded with danger.</p>
               <p>Having ſpent the day in their retreat, at the approach of
evening they ſally forth, and ſkim rapidly up and down along the hedges.
The barn-owl indeed, who lives chiefly upon mice, is contented to be more
ſtationary: he takes his reſidence upon ſome ſhock of corn, or the
point of ſome old houſe; and there watches in the dark, with the utmoſt
perſpicacity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</p>
               <p>Nor are theſe birds by any means ſilent; they all have an
hideous note; which, while purſuing their prey, is ſeldom heard; but may be
conſidered rather as a call to courtſhip. There is ſomething always
terrifying in this call, which is often heard in the ſilence of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
and breaks the general pauſe with an horrid variation. It is different in
all; but in each it is alarming and diſagreeable. Father Kircher, who has
ſet the voices of birds to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, has given all the tones of the owl note,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0823900105:167"/> which makes a moſt tremendous melody. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the
prejudices of mankind are united with their ſenſations to make the cry of
the owl diſagreeable. The ſcreech-owl's voice was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſidered
among the people, as a preſage of ſome ſad calamity that was ſoon to
enſue.</p>
               <p>They ſeldom, however, are heard while they are preying; that
important purſuit is always attended with ſilence, as it is by no means
their intention to diſturb or forwarn thoſe little ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals they wiſh to
ſurprize. When their purſuit has been ſucceſsful, they ſoon return to
their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, or to their young, if that be the ſeaſon. If, however,
they find but little game, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their queſt ſtill longer; and it
ſometimes happens that, obeying the dictates of appetite rather than of
prudence, they purſue ſo long that broad day breaks in upon them, and
leaves them dazzled, bewildered, and at a diſtance from home.</p>
               <p>In this diſtreſs they are obliged to take ſhelter in the
firſt tree or hedge that offers, there to continue concealed all day, till
the returning darkneſs once more ſupplies them with a better plan of the
country. But it too often happens that, with all their precaution to conceal
themſelves, they are ſpied out by the other birds of the place, and are
ſure to receive <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0823900105:168"/> no mercy. The black-bird, the
thruſh, the jay, the bunting, and the red-breaſt, all come in file, and
employ their little arts of inſult and abuſe. The ſmalleſt, the
feebleſt, and the moſt contemptible of this unfortunate bird's enemies, are
then the foremoſt to injure and torment him. They encreaſe their cries and
turbulence round him, flap him with their wings, and are ready to ſhew their
courage to be great, as they are ſenſible that their danger is but ſmall.
The unfortunate owl, not knowing where to attack or where to fly, patiently
ſits and ſuffers all their inſults. Aſtoniſhed and dizzy, he only
replies to their mockeries by aukward and ridiculous geſtures, by turning his
head, and rolling his eyes with an air of ſtupidity. It is enough that an owl
appears by day to ſet the whole grove into a kind of uproar. Either the
averſion all the ſmall birds have to this animal, or the
conſciouſneſs of their own ſecurity, makes them purſue him without
ceaſing, while they encourage each other by their mutual cries to lend
aſſiſtance in this laudable undertaking.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens, however, that the little birds purſue
their inſults with the ſame impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent zeal with which the owl himſelf
had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his depredations. They hunt him the whole day until evening
returns; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0823900105:169"/> him his faculties of ſight
once more, he makes the foremoſt of his purſuers pay dear for their former
ſport: nor is man always an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſpectator here. The bird-catchers
have got an art of counterfeiting the cry of the owl exactly; and, having
before limed the branches of an hedge, they ſit unſeen and give the call.
At this, all the little birds flock to the place where they expect to find
their well-known ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but inſtead of finding their ſtupid anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt
they are ſtuck faſt to the hedge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This ſport muſt be put
in practice an hour before night-fall in order to be ſucceſsful; for if it
is put off till later, thoſe birds which but a few minutes ſooner came to
provoke their enemy, will then fly from him with as much terror as they juſt
before ſhewed inſolence.</p>
               <p>It is not unpleaſant to ſee one ſtupid bird made in ſome
ſort a decoy to deceive another. The great horned owl is ſometimes made
uſe of for this purpoſe, to lure the kite when fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coners deſire to catch
him for the purpoſes of training the falcon. Upon this occaſion they clap
the tail of a fox to the great owl to render his figure extraordinary; in which
trim he ſails ſlowly along, flying low, which is his uſual manner. The
kite, either curious to obſerve this odd kind of animal, or perhaps
inquiſitive <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0823900105:170"/> to ſee whether it may not be proper for
food, flies after, and comes nearer and nearer. In this manner he continues to
hover, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to deſcend, till the falconer ſetting a
ſtrong-winged hawk againſt him, ſeizes him for the purpoſe of training
his young ones at home.</p>
               <p>The uſual place where the great horned owl breeds is in the
cavern of a rock, the hollow of a tree, or the turret of ſome ruined
caſtle. Its neſt is near three feet in diameter, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of
ſticks, bound together by the fibrous roots of trees, and lined with leaves
on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. It lays about three eggs, which are larger than thoſe of a
hen, and of a colour ſomewhat reſembling the bird itſelf. The young ones
are very voracious, and the parents not leſs expert at ſatisfying the call
of hunger. The leſſer owl of this kind never makes a neſt for itſelf,
but always takes up with the old neſt of ſome other bird, which it has
often been forced to abandon. It lays four or five eggs; and the young are all
white at firſt, but change colour in about a fortnight. The other owls in
general build near the place where they chiefly prey; that which feeds upon
birds in ſome neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grove, that which preys chiefly upon mice near
ſome farmer's yard, where the proprietor of the place takes care to give it
perfect ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0823900105:171"/> In fact, whatever miſchief one
ſpecies of owl may do in the woods, the barn-owl makes a ſufficient
recompenſe for, by being equally active in deſtroying mice nearer home;
ſo that a ſingle owl is ſaid to be more ſerviceable than half a dozen
cats, in ridding the barn of its domeſtic vermin. 
<q rend="inline">"In the year 1580," ſays an old writer, "at
Hallontide, an army of mice ſo over-run the marſhes near Southminſter,
that they eat up the graſs to the very roots. But at length a great number of
ſtrange painted owls came and devoured all the mice. The like happened again
in Eſſex about ſixty years after."</q>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude our account of theſe birds, they are all very
ſhy of man, and extremely indocile and difficult to be tamed. The white owl
in particular, as Mr. Buffon aſſerts, cannot be made to live in captivity;
I ſuppoſe he means if it be taken when old. 
<q rend="inline">"They live," ſays he, "ten or twelve days in
the aviary where they are ſhut up; but they refuſe all kind of
nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and at laſt die of hunger. By day they remain without moving
upon the floor of the aviary; in the evening, they mount on the higheſt
perch, where they continue to make a noiſe like a man ſnoring with his
mouth open. This ſeems deſigned as a call <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0823900105:172"/> for their
old companions without; and, in fact, I have ſeen ſeveral others come to
the call, and perch upon the roof of the aviary, where they made the ſame
kind of hiſſing, and ſoon after permitted themſelves to be taken in a
net."</q>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Birds of the Poultry Kind.</head>
               <p>FROM the moſt rapacious and noxious tribe of birds, we make a
tranſition to thoſe which of all others are the moſt harmleſs and the
moſt ſerviceable to man. He may force the rapacious tribes to aſſiſt
his pleaſures in the field, or induce the ſmaller warblers to delight him
with their ſinging; but it is from the poultry kind that he derives the
moſt ſolid advantages, as they not only make a conſiderable addition to
the neceſſaries of life, but furniſh out the greateſt delicacies to
every entertainment.</p>
               <p>Almoſt if not all the domeſtic birds of the poultry kind
that we maintain in our yards are of foreign extraction; but there are others
to be ranked in this claſs that are as yet in a ſtate of nature; and
perhaps only wait till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſufficiently ſcarce to be taken under
the care of man to multiply their propagation. It will appear remarkable
enough, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much the tame poultry which we have imported from
diſtant climates has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and how much thoſe wild birds of the
poultry kind that have never yet been taken <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0823900105:175"/> into keeping
have been diminiſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. They are all thinned; and many of the
ſpecies, eſpecially in the more cultivated and populous parts of the
kingdom, are utterly unſeen.</p>
               <p>Under birds of the poultry kind I rank all thoſe that have
white fleſh, and, comparatively to their head and limbs, have bulky bodies.
They are furniſhed with ſhort ſtrong bills for picking up grain, which is
their chief and often their only ſuſtenance. Their wings are ſhort and
concave; for which reaſon they are not able to fly far. They lay a great many
eggs; and, as they lead their young abroad the very day they are hatched, in
queſt of food, which they are ſhewn by the mother, and which they pick up
for themſelves, they generally make their neſts on the ground. The toes of
all theſe are united by a membrane as far as the firſt articulation, and
then are divided as in thoſe of the former claſs.</p>
               <p>Under this claſs we may therefore rank the common cock, the
peacock, the turkey, the pintada or Guinea hen, the pheaſant, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard,
the grous, the partridge, and the quail. Theſe all bear a ſtrong
ſimilitude to each other, being equally granivorous, fleſhy, and delicate 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0823900105:176"/> to the palate. Theſe are among birds what beaſts of
paſture are among quadrupedes, peaceable tenants of the field, and ſhunning
the thicker parts of the foreſt, that abounds with numerous animals who carry
on unceaſing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities againſt them.</p>
               <p>As Nature has formed the rapacious claſs for war, ſo ſhe
ſeems equally to have fitted theſe for peace, reſt, and ſociety. Their
wings are but ſhort, ſo that they are ill formed for wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering from one
region to another; their bills are alſo ſhort, and incapable of annoying
their oppoſers; their legs are ſtrong indeed; but their toes are made for
ſcratching up their food, and not for holding or tearing it. Theſe are
ſufficient indications of their harmleſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; while their bodies, which
are fat and fleſhy, render them unwieldy travellers, and incapable of
ſtraying far from each other.</p>
               <p>Accordingly we find them chiefly in ſociety; they live
together; and though they may have their diſputes, like all other animals,
upon ſome occaſions; yet, when kept in the ſame diſtrict, or fed in the
ſame yard, they learn the arts of ſubordination; and, in proportion as each
knows his ſtrength, he ſeldom tries a ſecond time the combat where he has
once been worſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0823900105:177"/>In this manner, all of this kind ſeem to
lead an indolent voluptuous life: as they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed internally with a
very ſtrong ſtomach, commonly called a gizzard, ſo their
voraciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſcarce knows any bounds. If kept in cloſe captivity, and
ſeparated from all their former companions, they ſtill have the pleaſure
of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left; and they ſoon grow fat and unwieldy in their priſon. To
ſay this more ſimply, many of the wilder ſpecies of birds, when cooped or
caged, pine away, grow gloomy, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe all ſuſtenance
whatever; none except thoſe of the poultry kind grow fat, who ſeem to
loſe all remembrance of their former liberty, ſatisfied with indolence and
plenty.</p>
               <p>The poultry kind may be conſidered as ſenſual epicures,
ſolely governed by their appetites. The indulgence of theſe ſeems to
influence their other habits, and deſtroys among them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubial
fidelity for which moſt other kinds are remarkable. The eagle and the falcon,
how fierce ſoever to other animals, are yet gentle and true to each other;
their connexions when once formed continue till death; and the male and female
in every exigence and every duty lend faithful aſſiſtance to each other.
They aſſiſt each other in the production of their young, in 
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0823900105:178"/> providing for them when produced; and even then, though
they drive them forth to fight their own battles, yet the old ones ſtill
retain their former affection to each other, and ſeldom part far
aſunder.</p>
               <p>But it is very different with this luxurious claſs I am now
deſcribing. Their courtſhip is but ſhort, and their congreſs
fortuitous. The male takes no heed of his offspring; and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the
pleaſure of getting, leaves to the female all the care of providing for
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. Wild and irregular in his appetites, he ranges from one to
another; and claims every female which he is ſtrong enough to keep from his
fellows. Though timorous when oppoſed to birds of prey, yet he is incredibly
bold among thoſe of his own kind; and but to ſee a male of his own
ſpecies is ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a combat. As his deſires extend to all,
every creature becomes his enemy that pretends to be his rival.</p>
               <p>The female, equally without fidelity or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, yields to
the moſt powerful. She ſtands by, a quiet meretricious ſpectator of their
fury, ready to reward the conqueror with every compliance. She takes upon
herſelf all the labour of hatching and bringing up her <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0823900105:179"/>
young, and chuſes a place for hatching as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote as poſſible from the
cock. Indeed, ſhe gives herſelf very little trouble in making a neſt, as
her young ones are to forſake it the inſtant they part from the
ſhell.</p>
               <p>She is equally unaſſiſted in providing for her young, that
are not fed with meat put into their mouths, as in other claſſes of the
feathered kind, but peck their food, and, forſaking their neſts, run here
and there, following the parent wherever it is to be found. She leads them
forward where they are likely to have the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of grain, and
takes care to ſhew by pecking, the ſort proper for them to ſeek for.
Though at other times voracious, ſhe is then abſtemious to an extreme
degree; and, intent only on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for and ſhewing her young clutch their
food, ſhe ſcarce takes any nouriſhment herſelf. Her parental pride
ſeems to overpower every other appetite; but that decreaſes in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as her young ones are more able to provide for themſelves, and then all her
voracious habits return.</p>
               <p>Among the other habits peculiar to this claſs of birds is that
of duſting themſelves. They lie flat in ſome duſty place, and with
their wings and feet raiſe and ſcatter the duſt over 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0823900105:180"/> their whole body. What may be their reaſon for thus
doing it is not eaſy to explain. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the heat of their bodies is ſuch,
that they require this powder to be interpoſed between their feathers to keep
them from lying too cloſe together, and thus encreaſing that heat with
which they are incommoded.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Cock.</head>
               <p>ALL birds taken under the protection of man loſe a part of
their natural figure, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not only in their habits but their very
form. Climate, food, and captivity, are three very powerful agents in producing
theſe alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and thoſe birds that have longeſt felt their
influence under human direction, are the moſt likely to have the greateſt
variety in their figures, their plumage, and their diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>Of all other birds, the cock ſeems to be the oldeſt
companion of mankind, to have been firſt reclaimed from the foreſt, and
taken to ſupply the accidental failure of the luxuries or neceſſities of
life. As he is thus longeſt under the care of man, ſo of all others perhaps
he exhibits the greateſt number of varieties, there being ſcarce two birds
of this ſpecies that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly reſemble each other in plumage and form. The
tail, which makes ſuch a beautiful figure in the generality of theſe birds,
is yet found en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely wanting in others; and not only the tail but the rump
alſo. The toes, which are uſually four in all animals of the poultry kind,
yet in <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0823900105:182"/> a ſpecies of the cock are found to amount to
five. The feathers, which lie ſo ſleek and in ſuch beautiful order in
moſt of thoſe we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, are in a peculiar breed all
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and ſtand ſtaring the wrong way. Nay, there is a ſpecies that
comes from Japan, which inſtead of feathers ſeems to be covered over with
hair. Theſe and many other varieties are to be found in this animal, which
ſeem to be the marks this early priſoner bears of his long captivity.</p>
               <p>It is not well aſcertained when the cock was firſt made
domeſtic in Europe; but it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally agreed that we firſt had him in
our weſtern world from the kingdom of Perſia. Ariſtophanes calls the cock
the Perſian bird, and tells us he enjoyed that kingdom before ſome of its
earlieſt monarchs. This animal was in fact known ſo early even in the
moſt ſavage parts of Europe, that we are told the cock was one of the
forbidden foods among the ancient Britons. Indeed, the domeſtic fowl ſeems
to have baniſhed the wild one. Perſia itſelf, that firſt introduced it
to our acquaintance, ſeems no longer to know it in its natural form; and if
we did not find it wild in ſome of the woods of India, as well as thoſe of
the iſlands in the Indian Ocean, we might begin to doubt, as

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0823900105:185"/> we do with regard to the ſheep, in what form it
firſt exiſted in a ſtate of nature.</p>
               <p>But thoſe doubts no longer exiſt: the cock is found in the
iſlands of Tinian, in many others of the Indian Ocean, and in the woods on
the coaſts of Malabar, in his ancient ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependance. In his wild
condition, his plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is black and yellow, and his comb and wattles yellow
and purple. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peculiarity alſo in thoſe of the Indian
woods; their bones which when boiled with us are white, as every body knows, in
thoſe are as black as ebony. Whether this tincture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their food,
as the bones are tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured red by feeding upon madder, I leave to the
diſcuſſion of others: ſatisfied with the fact, let us decline
ſpeculation.</p>
               <p>In their firſt propagation in Europe, there were
diſtinctions then that now ſubſiſt no longer. The ancients eſteemed
thoſe fowls whoſe plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was rediſh as invaluable; but as for the white
it was conſidered as utterly unfit for domeſtic purpoſes. Theſe they
regarded as ſubject to become a prey to rapacious birds; and Ariſtotle
thinks them leſs fruitful than the former. Indeed, his diviſion of thoſe
birds ſeems taken from their culinary uſes; the one ſort he calls
generous and noble, being remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for fecundity; the other ſort, ignoble
and <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0823900105:186"/> uſeleſs, from their ſterility. Theſe
diſtinctions differ widely from our modern notions of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity in this
animal; that which we call the game-cock being by no means ſo fruitful as the
ungenerous dunghill-cock, which we treat with contempt. The Athenians had their
cock-matches as well as we; but it is probable they did not enter into our
refinement of chuſing out the moſt barren of the ſpecies for the
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of combat.</p>
               <p>However this be, no animal in the world has greater courage than
the cock when oppoſed to one of his own ſpecies; and in every part of the
world where refinement and poliſhed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have not entirely taken place,
cock-fighting is a principal diverſion. In China, India, the Philipine
Iſlands, and all over the eaſt, cock-fighting is the ſport and
amuſement even of kings and princes. With us it is declining every day; and
it is to be hoped it will in time become only the paſtime of the loweſt
vulgar. It is the opinion of many that we have a bolder and more valiant breed
than is to be found elſewhere; and ſome, indeed, have entered into a
ſerious diſcuſſion upon the cauſe of ſo flattering a
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. But the truth is, they have cocks in China as bold, if not
bolder, than ours; and, what would ſtill be conſidered as valuable 
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0823900105:187"/> among cockers here, they have more ſtrength with
leſs weight. Indeed, I have often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered why men who lay two or three
hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds upon the proweſs of a ſingle cock, have not taken every
method to improve the breed. Nothing, it is probable, could do this more
effectually than by croſſing the ſtrain, as it is called, by a foreign
mixture; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having recourſe even to the wild cock in the foreſts
of India would not be uſeful, I leave to their conſideration. However, it
is a mean and ungenerous amuſement, nor would I wiſh much to promote it.
The truth is, I could give ſuch inſtructions with regard to cock-fighting,
and could ſo arm one of theſe animals againſt the other, that it would be
almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the adverſary's cock to ſurvive the firſt or
ſecond blow; but, as Boerhave has ſaid upon a former occaſion, when he
was treating upon poiſons, 
<q rend="inline">"to teach the arts of cruelty is equivalent to
committing them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This extraordinary courage in the cock is thought to proceed
from his being the moſt ſalacious of all other birds whatſoever. A
ſingle cock ſuffices for ten or a dozen hens; and it is ſaid of him that
he is the only animal whoſe ſpirits are not abated by indulgence. But then
he ſoon grows old; the radical moiſture is <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0823900105:188"/>
exhauſted; and in three or four years he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes utterly unfit for the
purpoſes of impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. 
<q rend="inline">"Hens alſo," to uſe the words of
Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby, "as they for the greateſt part of the year daily lay eggs,
cannot ſuffice for ſo many births, but for the moſt part after three
years become effete and barren: for when they have exhauſted all their
ſeed-eggs, of which they had but a certain quantity from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they
muſt neceſſarily ceaſe to lay, there being no new ones generated
within."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The hen ſeldom clutches a brood of chickens above once a
ſeaſon, though inſtances have been known in which they produced two. The
number of eggs a domeſtic hen will lay in the year are above two hundred,
provided ſhe be well fed and ſupplied with water and liberty. It matters
not much whether ſhe be trodden by the cock or no; ſhe will continue to
lay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the eggs of this kind can never by hatching be brought to
produce a living ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. Her neſt is made without any care, if left to
herſelf; a hole ſcratched into the ground, among a few buſhes, is the
only preparation ſhe makes for this ſeaſon of patient expectation.
Nature, almoſt exhauſted by its own fecundity, ſeems to inform her of the
proper time for hatching, which ſhe herſelf teſtifies by a clucking 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0823900105:189"/> note, and by diſcontinuing to lay. The good
houſewives, who often get more by their hens laying than by their chickens,
often artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially protract this clucking ſeaſon, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
entirely remove it. As ſoon as their hen begins to cluck, they ſtint her in
her proviſions; which, if that fails, they plunge her into cold water; this,
for the time, effectually puts back her hatching; but then it often kills the
poor bird, who takes cold and dies under the operation.</p>
               <p>If left entirely to herſelf, the hen would ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom lay above
twenty eggs in the ſame neſt, without attempting to hatch them: but in
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as ſhe lays, her eggs are removed; and ſhe continues to lay,
vainly hoping to encreaſe the number. In the wild ſtate, the hen ſeldom
lays above fifteen eggs; but then her proviſion is more difficultly obtained,
and ſhe is perhaps ſenſible of the difficulty of maintaining too numerous
a family.</p>
               <p>When the hen begins to ſit, nothing can exceed her
perſeverance and patience; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues for ſome days immoveable; and
when forced away by the importunities of hunger, ſhe quickly returns.
Sometimes alſo her eggs become too hot for her to bear, eſpecially if ſhe
be furniſhed with too warm a neſt within doors, for then ſhe is obliged
to leave them to cool a little: thus the warmth of the neſt only retards 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0823900105:190"/> incubation, and often puts the brood a day or two back
in the ſhell. While the hen ſits, ſhe carefully turns her eggs, and even
removes them to different ſituations; till at length, in about three weeks,
the young brood begin to give ſigns of a deſire to burſt their
confinement. When by the repeated efforts of their bill, which ſerves like a
pioneer on this occaſion, they have broke themſelves a paſſage through
the ſhell, the hen ſtill continues to ſit till all are excluded. The
ſtrongeſt and beſt chickens generally are the firſt candidates for
liberty; the weakeſt come behind, and ſome even die in the ſhell. When
all are produced, ſhe then leads them forth to provide for themſelves. Her
affection and her pride ſeem then to alter her very nature, and correct her
imperfections. No longer voracious or cowardly, ſhe abſtains from all food
that her young can ſwallow, and flies boldly at every creature that ſhe
thinks is likely to do them miſchief. Whatever the invading animal be, ſhe
boldly attacks him; the horſe, the hog, or the maſtiff. When marching at
the head of her little troop, ſhe acts the commander, and has a variety of
notes to call her numerous train to their food, or to warn them of approaching
danger. Upon one of theſe occaſions, I have ſeen the whole brood run for
ſecurity into the <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0823900105:191"/> thickeſt part of an hedge, while
the hen herſelf ventured boldly forth, and faced a fox that came for plunder.
With a good maſtiff, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we ſoon ſent the invader back to his
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; but not before he had wounded the hen in ſeveral places.</p>
               <p>Ten or twelve chickens are the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that a good
hen can rear and clutch at a time; but as this bears no proportion to the
number of her eggs, ſchemes have been ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to clutch all the eggs of an
hen, and thus turn her produce to the greateſt advantage. By theſe
contrivances it has been obtained that a hen that ordinarily produces but
twelve chickens in the year, is found to produce as many chickens as eggs, and
conſequently often above two hundred. The contrivance I mean is the
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial method of hatching chickens in ſtoves, as is practiſed at Grand
Cairo; or in a chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical elaboratory properly graduated, as has been effected
by Mr. Reaumur. At Grand Cairo, they thus produce ſix or ſeven thouſand
chickens at a time; where, as they are brought forth in their mild ſpring,
which is warmer than our ſummer, the young ones thrive without clutching. But
it is otherwiſe in our colder and unequal climate; the little animal may,
without much difficulty, be hatched from the <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0823900105:192"/> ſhell;
but they almoſt all periſh when excluded. To remedy this, Reaumur has made
uſe of a woolen hen, as he calls it; which was nothing more than putting the
young ones in a warm baſket, and clapping over them a thick woolen canopy. I
ſhould think a much better ſubſtitute might be found; and this from among
the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies themſelves. Capons may very eaſily be taught to clutch a
freſh brood of chickens throughout the year; ſo that when one little colony
is thus reared, another may be brought to ſucceed it. Nothing is more common
than to ſee capons thus employed; and the manner of teaching them is this:
firſt the capon is made very tame, ſo as to feed from one's hand; then,
about evening, they pluck the feathers off his breaſt, and rub the bare
ſkin with nettles; they then put the chickens to him, which preſently run
under his breaſt and belly, and probably rubbing his bare ſkin gently with
their heads, allay the ſtinging pain which the nettles had juſt produced.
This is repeated for two or three nights, till the animal takes an affection to
the chickens that have thus given him relief, and continues to give them the
protection they ſeek for: perhaps alſo the querulous voice of the chickens
may be pleaſant to him in miſery, and invite him to ſuccour the
diſtreſt. He from <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0823900105:193"/> that time brings up a brood of
chickens like a hen, clutching them, feeding them, clucking, and performing all
the functions of the tendereſt parent. A capon once accuſtomed to this
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, will not give over; but when one brood is grown up, he may have
another nearly hatched put under him, which he will treat with the ſame
tenderneſs he did the former.</p>
               <p>The cock, from his ſalaciouſneſs, is allowed to be a
ſhort lived animal; but how long theſe birds live, if left to themſelves,
is not yet well aſcertained by any hiſtorian. As they are kept only for
profit, and in a few years become unfit for generation, there are few that,
from mere motives of curioſity, will make the tedious experiment of
maintaining a proper number till they die. Aldrovandus hints their age to be
ten years; and it is probable that this may be its extent. They are ſubject
to ſome diſorders, which it is not our buſineſs to deſcribe; and as
for poiſons, beſides nux vomica, which is fatal to moſt animals except
man, they are injured, as Linnaeus aſſerts, by elder-berries; of which they
are not a little fond.</p>

               <head>CHAP III. Of the Peacock.</head>
               <p>THE Peacock, by the common people of Italy, is ſaid to have
the plumage of an angel, the voice of a devil, and the guts of a thief. In
fact, each of theſe qualities mark pretty well the nature of this
extraordinary bird. When it appears with its tail expanded, there is none of
the feathered creation can vie with it for beauty; yet the horrid ſcream of
its voice ſerves to abate the pleaſure we find from viewing it; and ſtill
more, its inſatiable gluttony and ſpirit of depredation make it one of the
moſt noxious domeſtics that man has taken under his protection.</p>
               <p>Our firſt peacocks were brought from the Eaſt Indies; and we
are aſſured, that they are ſtill found in vaſt flocks, in a wild
ſtate, in the iſlands of Java and Ceylone. So beautiful a bird, and one
eſteemed ſuch a delicacy at the tables of the luxurious, could not be
permitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long at liberty in its diſtant retreats. So early as
the days of Solomon, we find in his navies, among the articles imported from
the Eaſt, apes and peacocks. Aelian relates, <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0823900105:195"/> that they
were brought into Greece from ſome barbarous country, and were held in ſuch
high eſteem among them, that a male and female were valued at above thirty
pounds of our money. We are told alſo, that when Alexander was in India, he
found them flying wild, in vaſt numbers, on the banks of the river Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotis,
and was ſo ſtruck with their beauty, that he laid a ſevere fine and
puniſhment on all who ſhould kill or diſturb them. Nor are we to be
ſuprized at this, as the Greeks were ſo much ſtruck with the beauty of
this bird, when firſt brought among them, that every perſon paid a fixed
price for ſeeing it; and ſeveral people came to Athens, from Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon and
Theſſaly, purely to ſatisfy their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.</p>
               <p>It was probably firſt introduced into the Weſt, merely on
account of its beauty; but mankind, from contemplating its figure, ſoon came
to think of ſerving it up for a different en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. Aufidius Hurco
ſtands charged by Pliny with being the firſt who fatted up the peacock for
the feaſts of the luxurious. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there may be of delicacy in the
fleſh of a young peacock, it is certain an old one is very indifferent
eating; nevertheleſs, there is no mention made of chuſing the youngeſt:
it is <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0823900105:196"/> probable they were killed indiſcriminately, the
beauty of the feathers in ſome meaſure ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the appetite.
Hortenſius the orator was the firſt who ſerved them up at an
entertainment at Rome; and from that time they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one of the
greateſt ornaments of every feaſt. Whether the Roman method of cookery,
which was much higher than ours, might not have rendered them more palatable
than we find them at preſent, I cannot tell: but certain it is, they talk of
the peacock as being the firſt of viands.</p>
               <p>Its fame for delicacy, however, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue very long; for
we find, in the times of Francis the Firſt, that it was a cuſtom to ſerve
up peacocks to the tables of the great, with an intention not to be eaten, but
only to be ſeen. Their manner was to ſtrip off the ſkin; and then
preparing the body with the warmeſt ſpices, they covered it up again in its
former ſkin, with all its plumage in full diſplay, and no way injured by
the preparation. The bird thus prepared, was often preſerved for many years
without corrupting; and it is aſſerted of the peacock's fleſh, that it
keeps longer unputrefied than that of any other animal. To give a higher zeſt
to theſe entertainments, on weddings particularly, they filled the bird's
beak and throat with cotton <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0823900105:197"/> and camphire, which they
ſet on fire, to amuſe and delight the company. I do not know that the
peacock is much uſed at our entertainments at preſent, except now and then
at an alderman's dinner or a common-council feaſt, when our citizens
reſolve to be ſplendid; and even then it is never ſerved with its cotton
and camphire.</p>
               <p>Like other birds of the poultry kind, the peacock feeds upon
corn; but its chief predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is for barley. But as it is a very proud and
fickle bird, there is ſcarce any food that it will not at times covet and
purſue. Inſects and tender plants are often eagerly ſought at a time that
it has a ſufficiency of its natural food pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided more nearly. In the
indulgence of theſe capricious purſuits, walls cannot eaſily confine it;
it ſtrips the tops of houſes of their tiles or thatch, it lays waſte the
labours of the gardener, roots up his choiceſt ſeeds, and nips his
favourite flowers in the bud. Thus its beauty but ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſes for the
miſchief it occaſions; and many of the more homely looking fowls are very
deſervedly preferred before it.</p>
               <p>Nor is the peacock leſs a debauchee in its affections, than a
glutton in its appetites. He is ſtill more ſalacious than even the cock;
and though not poſſeſſed of the ſame vigour, yet burns with more
immoderate deſire. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0823900105:198"/> five females at
leaſt to attend him; and if there be not a ſufficient number, he will even
run upon and tread the ſitting hen. For this reaſon, the pea-hen
endeavours, as much as ſhe can, to hide her neſt from the male, as he would
otherwiſe diſturb her ſitting, and break her eggs.</p>
               <p>The pea-hen ſeldom lays above five or ſix eggs in this
climate before ſhe ſits. Ariſtotle deſcribes her as laying twelve; and
it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, in her native climate, ſhe may be thus prolific; for it is
certain, that in the foreſts where they breed naturally, they are numerous
beyond expreſſion. This bird lives about twenty years; and not till its
third year has it that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful variegated plumage that adorns its tail.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"In the kingdom of Cambaya," ſays Tave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
"near the city of Baroch, whole flocks of them are ſeen in the fields. They
are very ſhy, however, and it is impoſſible to come near them. They run
off ſwifter than the partridge; and hide themſelves in thickets, where it
is impoſſible to find them. They perch, by night, upon trees; and the
fowler often approaches them at that ſeaſon with a kind of banner, on which
a peacock is painted to the life, on either ſide. A lighted torch is fixed on
the top of this decoy; and the peacock, when diſturbed, flies to what it
takes <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0823900105:199"/> for another, and is thus caught in a nooze
prepared for that purpoſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>There are varieties of this bird, ſome of which are white,
others creſted: that which is called the Peacock of Thibet, is the moſt
beautiful of the feathered creation, containing in its plumage all the moſt
vivid colours, red, blue, yellow, and green, diſpoſed in an almoſt
artificial order, as if merely to pleaſe the eye of the beholder.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. The Turkey.</head>
               <p>THE natal place of the cock and the peacock is pretty well
aſcertained, but there are ſtronger doubts concerning the Turkey; ſome
contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it has been brought into Europe from the Eaſt Indies many
centuries ago; while others aſſert, that it is wholly unknown in that part
of the world, that it is a native of the New Continent, and that it was not
brought into Europe till the diſcovery of that part of the world.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who contend for the latter opinion, very truly
obſerve, that among all the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have of Eaſtern birds, that
of the turkey is not to be found; while, on the contrary, it is very well known
in the New Continent, where it runs wild about the woods. It is ſaid, by
them, to be firſt ſeen in France, in the reign of Francis the Firſt; and
in England, in that of Henry the Eighth; which is about the time when Mexico
was firſt conquered by Spain. On the other hand, it is aſſerted, that the
turkey, ſo far from being unknown in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope before that time, was known even
to the <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0823900105:201"/> antients; and that Aelian has given a pretty
juſt deſcription of it. They alledge, that its very name implies its having
been brought from ſome part of the Eaſt; and that it is found, among other
dainties ſerved up to the tables of the great, before that time among
ourſelves. But what they pretend to be the ſtrongeſt proof is, that
though the wild turkey be ſo very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in America, yet the natives cannot
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to tame it; and though hatched in the ordinary manner, nothing can
render it domeſtic. In this diverſity of opinions, perhaps it is beſt to
ſuſpend aſſent, till more lights are thrown on the ſubject; however,
I am inclined to concur with the former opinion.</p>
               <p>With us, when young, it is one of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt of all birds;
yet, in its wild ſtate, it is found in great plenty in the foreſts of
Canada, that are covered with ſnow above three parts of the year. In their
natural woods, they are found much larger than in their ſtate of domeſtic
captivity. They are much more beautiful alſo, their feathers being of a dark
grey, bordered at the edges with a bright gold colour. Theſe the ſavages of
the country weave into cloaks to adorn their perſons, and faſhion into fans
and umbrellas, but never once think of taking into keeping animals that the
woods furniſh <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0823900105:202"/> them with in ſufficient abundance.
Savage man ſeems to find a delight in precarious poſſeſſion. A great
part of the pleaſure of the chace lies in the uncertainty of the purſuit,
and he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to abridge himſelf in any accidental ſucceſs that
may attend his fatigues. The hunting the turkey therefore, makes one of his
principal diverſions; as its fleſh contributes chiefly to the ſupport of
his family. When he has diſcovered the place of their retreat, which, in
general, is near fields of nettles, or where there is plenty of any kind of
grain, he takes his dog with him, which is trained to the ſport, (a faithful
rough creature, ſuppoſed to be originally reclaimed from the wolf) and he
ſends him into the midſt of the flock. The turkies no ſooner perceive
their enemy, than they ſet off running at full ſpeed, and with ſuch
ſwiftneſs that they leave the dog far behind them: he follows
nevertheleſs, and ſenſible they muſt ſoon be tired, as they cannot go
full ſpeed for any length of time, he, at laſt, forces them to take
ſhelter in a tree, where they ſit quite ſpent and fatigued, till the
hunter comes up, and, with a long pole, knocks them down one after the
other.</p>
               <p>This manner of ſuffering themſelves to be deſtroyed,
argues no great inſtinct in the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0823900105:203"/> and indeed,
in their captive ſtate, they do not appear to be poſſeſſed of much.
They ſeem a ſtupid, vain, querulous tribe, apt enough to quarrel among
themſelves, yet without any weapons to do each other an injury. Every body
knows the ſtrange antipathy the turkey-cock has to a red colour; how he
briſtles, and, with his peculiar gobbling ſound, flies to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack it. But
there is another method of encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the animoſity of theſe birds
againſt each other, which is often practiſed by boys, when they have a mind
for a battle. This is no more than to ſmear over the head of one of the
turkies with dirt, and the reſt run to attack it with all the ſpeed of
impotent animoſity: nay, two of them, thus diſguiſed, will fight each
other till they are almoſt ſuffocated with fatigue and anger.</p>
               <p>But though ſo furious among themſelves, they are weak and
cowardly againſt other animals, though far leſs powerful than they. The
cock often makes the turkey keep at a diſtance; and they ſeldom venture to
attack him but with united force, when they rather oppreſs him by their
weight, than annoy him by their arms. There is no animal, how contemptible
ſoever, that will venture boldly to face the turkey-cock, that he will not
fly from. On the contrary, with the inſolence of a bully, he purſues any 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0823900105:204"/> thing that ſeems to fear him, particularly lap-dogs
and children, againſt both which he ſeems to have a peculiar averſion. On
ſuch occaſions, after he has made them ſcamper, he returns to his female
train, diſplays his plumage around, ſtruts about the yard, and gobbles out
a note of ſelf-approbation.</p>
               <p>The female ſeems of a milder, gentler diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Rather
querulous than bold, ſhe hunts about in queſt of grain, and purſuit of
inſects, being particularly delighted with the eggs of ants and caterpillars.
She lays eighteen or twenty eggs, larger than thoſe of a hen, whitiſh, but
marked with ſpots reſembling the freckles of the face. Her young are
extremely tender at firſt, and muſt be carefully fed with curd chopped with
dock leaves; but as they grow older, they become more hardy, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the
mother to conſiderable diſtances, in purſuit of inſect food, which they
prefer to any other. On theſe occaſions, however, the female, though ſo
large and, as it would ſeem, ſo powerful a bird, gives them but very little
protection againſt the attacks of any rapacious animal that comes in her way.
She rather warns her young to ſhift for themſelves, than prepares to defend
them. 
<q rend="inline">"I have heard," <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0823900105:205"/> ſays
the Abbe la Pluche, "a turkey hen, when at the head of her brood, ſend forth
the moſt hideous ſcream, without knowing as yet the cauſe: however, her
young, immediately when the warning was given, ſkulked under the buſhes,
the graſs, or whatever elſe offered for ſhelter or protection. They even
ſtretched themſelves at their full length upon the ground, and continued
lying as motionleſs as if they were dead. In the mean time, the mother, with
her eyes directed upwards, continued her cries and ſcreaming as before. Upon
looking up to where ſhe ſeemed to gaze, I diſcovered a black ſpot
juſt under the clouds, but was unable at firſt to determine what it was;
however, it ſoon appeared to be a bird of prey, though at firſt at too
great a diſtance to be diſtinguiſhed. I have ſeen one of theſe
animals continue in this violent agitated ſtate, and her whole brood pinned
down as it were to the ground, for four hours together; whilſt their
formidable ſoe has taken his circuits, has mounted, and hovered directly over
their heads: at laſt, upon diſappearing, the parent began to change her
note, and ſent forth another cry, which in an inſtant gave life to the
whole trembling tribe, and they all flocked round her with expreſſions of 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0823900105:206"/> pleaſure, as if conſcious of their happy eſcape
from danger."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When once grown up, turkies are very hardy birds, and feed
themſelves at very little expence to the farmer. Thoſe of Norfolk are
ſaid to be the largeſt of this kingdom, weighing from twenty to thirty
pounds. There are places, however, in the Eaſt Indies, where they are known
only in their domeſtic ſtate, in which they grow to the weight of ſixty
pounds.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. The Pheaſant.</head>
               <p>IT would ſurprize a ſportſman to be told that the
pheaſant which he finds wild in the woods, in the remoteſt parts of the
kingdom, and in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, which can ſcarce be ſaid to have an owner, is a
foreign bird, and was at firſt artificially propagated amongſt us. They
were brought into Europe from the banks of the Phaſis, a river of Colchis, in
Aſia Minor; and from whence they ſtill retain their name.</p>
               <p>Next to the peacock, they are the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of birds, as
well for the vivid colour of their plumes as for their happy mixtures and
variety. It is far beyond the power of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to draw any thing ſo
gloſſy, ſo bright, or points ſo finely blending into each other. We are
told that when Craeſus, king of Lydia, was ſeated on his throne, adorned
with royal magnificence, and all the barbarous pomp of eaſtern ſplendour,
he aſked Solon if he had ever beheld any thing ſo fine! The Greek
phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, no way moved by the objects before him, or taking a pride in
his native ſimplicity, replied, that after having ſeen the beautiful 
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0823900105:208"/> plumage of the pheaſant, he could be aſtoniſhed at
no other finery.</p>
               <p>In fact, nothing can ſatisfy the eye with a greater variety
and richneſs of ornament than this beautiful creature. The iris of the eyes
is yellow; and the eyes themſelves are ſurrounded with a ſcarlet colour,
ſprinkled with ſmall ſpecks of black. On the fore-part of the head there
are blackiſh feathers mixed with a ſhining purple. The top of the head and
the upper part of the neck are tinged with a darkiſh green that ſhines like
ſilk In ſome, the top of the head is of a ſhining blue, and the head
itſelf, as well as the upper part of the neck, appears ſometimes blue and
ſometimes green, as it is differently placed to the eye of the ſpectator.
The feathers of the breaſt, the ſhoulders, the middle of the back, and the
ſides under the wings, have a blackiſh ground, with edges tinged of an
exquiſite colour, which appears ſometimes black and ſometimes purple,
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different lights it is placed in; under the purple there is a
tranſverſe ſtreak of gold colour. The tail, from the middle feathers to
the root, is about eighteen inches long; the legs, the feet and the toes, are
of the colour of horn. There are black ſpurs on the legs, ſhorter than
thoſe of a cock; there is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0823900105:209"/> that connects
two of the toes together; and the male is much more beautiful than the
female.</p>
               <p>This bird, though ſo beautiful to the eye, is not leſs
delicate when ſerved up to the table. Its fleſh is conſidered as the
greateſt dainty; and when the old phyſicians ſpoke of the
whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs of any viands, they made their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the
fleſh of the pheaſant. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, notwithſtanding all theſe perfections
to tempt the curioſity or the palate, the pheaſant has multiplied in its
wild ſtate; and, as if diſdaining the protection of man, has left him to
take ſhelter in the thickeſt woods and the remoteſt foreſts. All others
of the domeſtic kind, the cock, the turkey, or the pintada, when once
reclaimed, have ſtill continued in their domeſtic ſtate, and perſevered
in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and appetites of willing ſlavery. But the pheaſant, though
taken from its native warm retreats, where the woods ſupply variety of food,
and the warm ſun ſuits its tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, has ſtill continued
its attachment to native freedom; and now wild among us, makes the moſt
envied ornament of our parks and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, where he feeds upon acorns and
berries, and the ſcanty produce of our chilling cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0823900105:210"/>This ſpirit of independance ſeems to
attend the pheaſant even in captivity. In the woods, the hen pheaſant lays
from eighteen to twenty eggs in a ſeaſon; but in a domeſtic ſtate ſhe
ſeldom lays above ten. In the ſame manner, when wild, ſhe hatches and
leads up her brood with patience, vigilance and courage; but when kept tame,
ſhe never ſits well; ſo that a hen is generally her ſubſtitute upon
ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and as for leading her young to their food, ſhe is
utterly ignorant of where it is to be found; and the young birds ſtarve, if
left ſolely to her protection. The pheaſant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on every account,
ſeems better left at large in the woods than reclaimed to priſtine
captivity. Its fecundity when wild is ſufficient to ſtock the foreſt; its
beautiful plumage adorns it; and its fleſh retains a higher flavour from its
unlimited freedom.</p>
               <p>However, it has been the aim of late to take theſe birds once
more from the woods, and to keep them in places fitted for their reception.
Like all others of the poultry kind, they have no great ſagacity, and
ſuffer themſelves eaſily to be taken. At night they rooſt upon the
higheſt trees of the wood; and by day they come down into the lower brakes
and buſhes, where their food is chiefly found. They gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0823900105:211"/> make a kind of flapping noiſe when they are with the
females; and this often apprizes the ſportſman of their retreats. At other
times he tracks them in the ſnow, and frequently takes them in ſprings. But
of all birds they are ſhot moſt eaſily, as they always make a whirring
noiſe when they riſe, by which they alarm the gunner, and being a large
mark, and flying very ſlow, there is ſcarce any miſſing them.</p>
               <q> 
                  <l>Ah! what avail his gloſſy, varying dyes,</l> 
                  <l>His purpled creſt and ſcarlet-circled eyes,</l> 
                  <l>The vivid green his ſhining plumes unfold,</l> 
                  <l>His painted wings, and breaſt that flames with gold?</l> 
                  <bibl>POPE.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>When theſe birds are taken young into keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they become as
familiar as chickens; and when they are deſigned for breeding, they are put
together in a yard, five hens to a cock; for this bird, like all of the poultry
kind, is very ſalacious. In her natural ſtate the female makes her neſt
of dry graſs and leaves; the ſame muſt be laid for her in the
pheaſandry, and ſhe herſelf will ſometimes properly diſpoſe them.
If ſhe refuſes to hatch her eggs, then a common hen muſt be got to
ſupply her place, which taſk ſhe will perform with perſeverance and
ſucceſs. The young ones are very difficult to be reared; and they muſt be
ſupplied with <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0823900105:212"/> ants-eggs, which is the food the old one
leads them to gather when wild in the woods. To make theſe go the farther,
they are to be chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up with curds or other meat; and the young ones are to
be fed with great exactneſs, both as to the quantity and the time of their
ſupply. This food is ſometimes alſo to be varied, and wood-lice, ear
wigs, and other inſects, are to make a variety. The place where they are
reared muſt be kept extremely clean; their water muſt be changed twice or
thrice a day; they muſt not be expoſed till the dew is off the ground in
the morning; and they ſhould always be taken in before ſun-ſet. When they
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come adult, they very well can ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they are
particularly fond of oats and barley.</p>
               <p>In order to encreaſe the breed, and make it ſtill more
valuable, Longolius teaches us a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that appears very peculiar. The
pheaſant is a very bold bird when firſt brought into the yard among other
poultry, not ſparing the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, nor even ſuch young cocks and hens as it
can maſter; but after a time it will live tamely among them, and will at
laſt be brought to couple with a common hen. The breed thus produced take
much ſtronger after the pheaſant than the hen; and in a few
ſucceſſions, if they <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0823900105:213"/> be let to breed with the
cock-pheaſant, for the mixture is not barren, there will be produced a
ſpecies more tame, ſtronger, and more prolific; ſo that he adds, that it
is ſtrange why moſt of our pheaſandries are not ſtocked with birds
produced in this manner.</p>
               <p>The pheaſant, when full grown, ſeems to feed indifferently
upon every thing that offers. It is ſaid by a French writer, that one of the
king's ſportſmen ſhooting at a parcel of crows, that were gathered round
a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, to his great ſurprize upon coming up, found that he had
killed as many pheaſants as crows. It is even aſſerted by ſome, that
ſuch is the carnivorous diſpoſition of this bird, that when ſeveral of
them are put together in the ſame yard, if one of them happens to fall
ſick, or ſeems to be pining, that all the reſt will fall upon, kill, and
devour it. Such is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of books; thoſe who have frequent
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of examining the manners of the bird itſelf, know what credit
ought to be given to ſuch an account.</p>
               <p>Of the pheaſant, as of all other domeſtic fowl, there are
many varieties. There are white pheaſants, creſted pheaſants, ſpotted
pheaſants; but of all others, the golden pheaſant of China is the moſt
beautiful. It is a doubt whether the <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0823900105:214"/> peacock itſelf
can bear the compariſon. However, the natives of China would not have us
conſider it as their moſt beautiful bird, though all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with
eyes, reſembling in miniature thoſe of a peacock. By their accounts, it is
far exceeded by the fongwhang, an imaginary bird, of which they give a moſt
phantaſtic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. It is thus that the people of every country,
though poſſeſſed of the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, have ſtill others
that they would perſuade ſtrangers they enjoy, which have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence only
in the imagination.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. The Pintada or Guinea-Hen.</head>
               <p>THIS is a very remarkable bird, and in ſome meaſure unites
the characteriſtics of the phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and the turkey. It has the fine
delicate ſhape of the one, and the bare head of the other. To be more
particular, it is about the ſize of a common hen; but as it is ſupported on
longer legs it looks much larger. It has a round back, with a tail turned
downwards like a partridge. The head is covered with a kind of caſque; and
the whole plumage is black or dark grey, ſpeckled with white ſpots. It has
wattles under the bill, which do not proceed from the lower chap as in cocks,
but from the upper, which gives it a very peculiar air, while its reſtleſs
gait and odd chuckling ſound diſtinguiſh it ſufficiently from all other
birds whatever.</p>
               <p>It is well known all over Europe, and even better than with us,
as the nations that border on the Mediterranean probably had it before us from
thoſe parts of Africa which lay neareſt. Accordingly we find it in
different countries called by different names, from the place whence they had
it. They are by <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0823900105:216"/> ſome called the Barbary-hen; by
others, the Tamis bird; and by others, the bird of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia. We have given it
the name of that part of Africa from whence probably it was firſt
brought.</p>
               <p>In many parts of their native country, they are ſeen in vaſt
flocks together, feeding their young, and leading them in queſt of food. All
their habits are like thoſe of the poultry-kind, and they agree in every
other reſpect, except that the male and female are ſo much alike, that they
can hardly be diſtinguiſhed aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The only difference lies in the
wattles deſcribed above, which in the cock are of a blueiſh caſt; in the
hen, they are more inclining to a red. Their eggs, like their bodies, are
ſpeckled; in our climate, they lay but five or ſix in a ſeaſon; but
they are far more prolific in their ſultry regions at home. They are kept
among us rather for ſhew than uſe, as their fleſh is not much eſteemed,
and as they give a good deal of trouble in the rearing.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. The Buſtard.</head>
               <p>THE Buſtard is the largeſt land-bird that is a native of
Britain. It was once much more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than it is at preſent; but the
encreaſed cultivation of the country, and the extreme delicacy of its
fleſh, has greatly thinned the ſpecies; ſo that a time may come when it
may be doubted whether ever ſo large a bird was bred among us. It is probable
that long before this the buſtard would have been extirpated, but for its
peculiar manner of feeding. Had it continued to ſeek ſhelter among our
woods, in proportion as they were cut down, it muſt have been deſtroyed. If
in the foreſt, the fowler might approach it without being ſeen; and the
bird, from its ſize, would be too great a mark to be eaſily miſſed. But
it inhabits only the open and extenſive plain, where its food lies in
abundance, and where every invader may be ſeen at a diſtance.</p>
               <p>The buſtard is much larger than the turkey, the male generally
weighing from twenty-five to twenty ſeven pounds. The neck is a foot long,
and the legs a foot and a half. The <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0823900105:218"/> wings are not
proportionable to the reſt of the body, being but four feet from the tip of
one to the other; for which reaſon the bird flies with great difficulty. The
head and neck of the male are aſh-coloured; the back is barred
tranſverſely with black, bright, and ruſt colour. The greater quill
feathers are black; the belly white; and the tail, which conſiſts of twenty
feathers, is marked with broad black bars.</p>
               <p>It would ſeem odd, as was hinted before, how ſo large a
land-bird as this could find ſhelter in ſo cultivated a country as England;
but the wonder will ceaſe when we find it only in the moſt open countries,
where there is ſcarce any approaching without being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. They are
frequently ſeen in flocks of fifty or more, in the extenſive downs of
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury Plain, in the heaths of Suffex and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeſhire, the
Dorſetſhire uplands, and ſo on as far as Eaſt Lothian in Scotland. In
thoſe extenſive plains, where there are no woods to ſcreen the
ſportſman, nor hedges to creep along, the buſtards enjoy an indolent
ſecurity. Their food is compoſed of the berries that grow among the heath,
and the large earth-worms that appear in great quantities on the downs before
ſun-riſing in ſummer. It is in vain that the fowler creeps forward to
approach them, <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0823900105:219"/> they have always centinels placed at
proper eminences, which are ever on the watch, and warn the flock of the
ſmalleſt appearance of danger. All therefore that is left the
ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is the comfortleſs view of their diſtant ſecurity. He may
wiſh, but they are in ſafety.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens that theſe birds, though they are
ſeldom ſhot by the gun, are often run down by grey-hounds. As they are
voracious and greedy, they often ſacrifice their ſafety to their appetite,
and feed themſelves ſo very fat, that they are unable to fly without great
preparation. When the grey-hound, therefore, comes within a certain diſtance,
the buſtard runs off flapping its wings, and endeavouring to gather air
enough under them to riſe; in the mean time, the enemy approaches nearer and
nearer, till it is too late for the bird even to think of obtaining ſafety by
flight; for juſt at the riſe there is always time loſt, and of this the
bird is ſenſible; it continues, therefore, on the foot until it has got a
ſufficient way before the dog for flight, or until it is taken.</p>
               <p>As there are few places where they can at once find proper food
and ſecurity, ſo they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally continue near their old haunts, ſeldom
wandering above twenty or thirty miles from home. As their food is replete with
moiſture, <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0823900105:220"/> it enables them to live upon theſe dry
plains, where there are ſcarcely any ſprings of water, a long time without
drinking. Beſides this, Nature has given the males an admirable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine for
their ſecurity againſt thirſt. This is a pouch, the entrance of which
lies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under the tongue, and capable of holding near ſeven quarts
of water. This is probably filled upon proper occaſions, to ſupply the hen
when ſitting, or the young before they can fly.</p>
               <p>Like all other birds of the poultry-kind, they change their
mates at the ſeaſon of incubation, which is about the latter end of
ſummer. They ſeparate in pairs if there be a ſufficiency of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males for
the males; but when this happens to be otherwiſe, the males fight until one
of them falls. In France, they often find ſome of thoſe victims to
gallantry dead in the fields, and no doubt are not diſpleaſed at the
occaſion.</p>
               <p>They make their neſts upon the ground, only juſt ſcraping
a hole in the earth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lining it with a little long graſs or
ſtraw. There they lay two eggs only, almoſt of the ſize of a gooſe egg,
of a pale olive brown, marked with ſpots of a darker colour. They hatch for
about five weeks, and the young ones run about as ſoon as they are out of the
ſhell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0823900105:221"/>The buſtards aſſemble in flocks in
the month of October, and keep together till April. In winter, as their food
becomes more ſcarce, they ſupport themſelves indiſcriminately, by
feeding on moles, mice, and even little birds, when they can ſeize them. For
want of other food, they are contented to live upon turnep leaves and ſuch
like ſucculent vegetables. In ſome parts of Switzerland, they are found
frozen in the fields in ſevere weather; but when taken to a warm place they
again recover. They uſually live fifteen years, and are incapable of being
propagated in a domeſtic ſtate, as they probably want that food which
beſt agrees with their appetite.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The Grous and its Affinities.</head>
               <p>THE Cock of the Wood, the Black Cock, the Grous, and the
Ptarmigan—Theſe are all birds of a ſimilar nature, and chiefly found
in heathy mountains and piny foreſts, at a diſtance from mankind. They
might once indeed have been common enough all over England, when a great part
of the country was covered with heath; but at preſent their numbers are
thinned: the two firſt of this kind are utterly unknown in the ſouth, and
have taken refuge in the northern parts of Scotland, where the extenſive
heaths afford them ſecurity, and the foreſts ſhelter.</p>
               <p>The cock of the wood is ſometimes of the ſize of a turkey,
and often weighs near four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pounds; the black cock, of which the male is
all over black, though the female is of the colour of a partridge, is about the
ſize of a hen, and, like the former, is only found with us in the highlands
of Scotland; the grous is about half as large again as a partridge, and its
colour much like that of a wood-cock, but redder; the ptarmigan is ſtill
ſomewhat leſs, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0823900105:223"/> and is of a pale brown or
aſh-colour. They are all diſtinguiſhable from other birds of the poultry
kind, by a naked ſkin, of a ſcarlet colour, above the eyes, in the place
and of the figure of eye-brows.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to be ſomething extraordinary, that all the larger
wild animals of every ſpecies chuſe the darkeſt and the inmoſt
receſſes of the woods for their reſidence, while the ſmaller kinds come
more into the open and cultivated parts, where there is more food and more
danger. It is thus with the birds I am deſcribing: while the cock of the wood
is ſeldom ſeen, except on the inacceſſible parts of heathy mountains,
or in the midſt of piny foreſts, the grous is found, in great numbers, in
the neighbourhood of corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, where there is heath to afford retreat and
ſhelter. Their food too ſomewhat differs; while the ſmaller kind lives
upon heath bloſſoms, cranberries, and corn, the larger feeds upon the cones
of the pine-tree; and will ſometimes entirely ſtrip one tree, before it
offers to touch thoſe of another, though juſt beſide him. In other
reſpects, the manners of theſe birds are the ſame; being both equally
ſimple in their diet, and licentious in their amours.</p>
               <p>The Cock of the Wood, for it is from him we will take our
deſcription, is, as was ſaid, <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0823900105:224"/> chiefly fond of a
mountainous and wooded ſituation. In winter he reſides in the darkeſt and
inmoſt part of the woods; in ſummer he ventures down from his retreats, to
make ſhort depredations on the farmer's corn. The deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his fleſh in
ſome meaſure ſets a high price upon his head; and as he is greatly
ſought after, ſo he continues, when he comes down from the hills, always on
his guard. Upon theſe occaſions, he is ſeldom ſurprized; and thoſe
who would take him, muſt venture up to find him in his native retreats.</p>
               <p>The cock of the wood, when in the foreſt, attaches himſelf
principally to the oak and the pine-tree; the cones of the latter ſerving for
his food, and the thick boughs for an habitation. He even makes a choice of
what cones he ſhall feed upon; for he ſometimes will ſtrip one tree bare
before he will deign to touch the cones of another. He feeds alſo upon ant's
eggs, which ſeem a high delicacy to all birds of the poultry kind:
cranberries are likewiſe often found in his crop; and his gizzard, like that
of domeſtic fowls, contains a quantity of gravel, for the purpoſes of
aſſiſting his powers of digeſtion.</p>
               <p>At the earlieſt return of ſpring, this bird begins to feel
the genial influence of the ſeaſon. During the month of March, the
approaches <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0823900105:225"/> of courtſhip are continued, and do not
deſiſt till the trees have all their leaves, and the foreſt is in full
bloom. During this whole ſeaſon, the cock of the wood is ſeen at
ſun-riſe, and ſetting extremely active upon one of the largeſt branches
of the pine-tree. With his tail raiſed and expanded like a fan, and the wings
drooping, he is ſeen walking backward and forward, his neck ſtretched out,
his head ſwolen and red, and making a thouſand ridiculous poſtures: his
cry, upon that occaſion, is a kind of loud exploſion, which is inſtantly
followed by a noiſe like the whetting of a ſcythe, which ceaſes and
commences alternatively for about an hour, and is then terminated by the ſame
exploſion.</p>
               <p>During the time this ſingular cry continues, the bird ſeems
entirely deaf, and inſenſible of every danger: whatever noiſe may be made
near him, or even though fired at, he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues his call; and this is
the time that ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men generally take to ſhoot him. Upon all other
occaſions, he is the moſt timorous and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bird in nature: but now he
ſeems entirely abſorbed by his inſtincts; and ſeldom leaves the place
where he firſt begins to feel the acceſſes of deſire. This
extraordinary cry, which is accompanied by a clapping of the wings, is no 
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0823900105:226"/> ſooner finiſhed, than the female hearing it
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, approaches, and places herſelf under the tree, from whence the cock
deſcends to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate her. The number of females that, on this occaſion,
reſort to his call, is uncertain; but one male generally ſuffices for
all.</p>
               <p>The female is much leſs than her mate, and entirely unlike him
in plumage, ſo that ſhe might be miſtaken for a bird of another
ſpecies: ſhe ſeldom lays more than ſix or ſeven eggs, which are
white, and marked with yellow, of the ſize of a common hen's egg: ſhe
generally lays them in a dry place and a moſſy ground, and hatches them
without the company of the cock. When ſhe is obliged, during the time of
incubation, to leave her eggs in queſt of food, ſhe covers them up ſo
artfully, with moſs or dry leaves, that it is extremely difficult to
diſcover them. On this occaſion, ſhe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely tame and tranquil,
however wild and timorous in ordinary. She often keeps to her neſt, though
ſtrangers attempt to drag her away.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the young ones are hatched, they are ſeen running
with extreme agility after the mother, though ſometimes they are not entirely
diſengaged from the ſhell. The hen leads them forward, for the firſt
time, into the woods, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0823900105:227"/> ſhews them ant's eggs, and the
wild moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-berries, which, while young, are their only food. As they grow
older, their appetites grow ſtronger, and they then feed upon the tops of
hether and the cones of the pine-tree. In this manner they ſoon come to
perfection: they are an hardy bird, their food lies every where before them,
and it would ſeem that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in great abundance. But this
is not the caſe; their numbers are thinned by rapacious birds and beaſts of
every kind; and ſtill more by their own ſalacious conteſts.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the clutching is over, which the female performs in
the manner of an hen, the whole brood follows the mother for about a month or
two; at the end of which the young males entirely forſake her, and keep in
great harmony together till the beginning of ſpring. At this ſeaſon, they
begin, for the firſt time, to feel the genial acceſs; and then adieu to all
their former friendſhips! They begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider each other as rivals; and
the rage of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence quite extinguiſhes the ſpirit of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
They fight each other, like game cocks; and at that time are ſo inattentive
to their own ſafety, that it often happens that two or three of them are
killed at a ſhot. It is probable, <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0823900105:228"/> that in theſe
conteſts, the bird which comes off victorious takes poſſeſſion of the
female ſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, as it is certain they have no faithful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments<note n="*" place="bottom">This account of the Cock of the Wood is taken from the

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Partridge and its Varieties.</head>
               <p>THE Partridge may be particularly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as belonging to
the ſportſman. It is a bird which even our laws have taken under
protection; and, like a peacock or a hen, may be ranked as a private property.
The only difference now is, that we feed one in our farms, the other in our
yards; that theſe are contented captives; thoſe, ſervants that have it in
their power to change their maſter, by changing their habitation.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Theſe birds," ſays Willoughby, "hold the
principal place in the feaſts and entertainments of princes; without which
their feaſts are eſteemed ignoble, vulgar, and of no account. The Frenchmen
do ſo highly value, and are ſo fond of the partridge, that if they be
wanting, they utterly ſlight and deſpiſe the beſt ſpread tables; as
if there could be no feaſt without them."</q> But however this might be in
the times of our hiſtorian, the partridge is now too common in France to be
conſidered as a delicacy; and this, as well as every other ſimple diſh,
is exploded for luxuries of a more compound invention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0823900105:230"/>In England, where the partridge is much
ſcarcer, and a great deal dearer, it is ſtill a favourite delicacy at the
tables of the rich; and the deſire of keeping it to themſelves, has
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to make laws for its preſervation, no way harmonizing with the
general ſpirit of Engliſh legiſlation. What can be more arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary than
to talk of preſerving the game; which, when defined, means no more than that
the poor ſhall abſtain from what the rich have taken a fancy to keep for
themſelves? If theſe birds could, like a cock or a hen, be made legal
property, could they be taught to keep within certain diſtricts, and only
feed on thoſe grounds that belong to the man whoſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments they
improve, it then might, with ſome ſhew of juſtice, be admitted, that as a
man fed them ſo he might claim them. But this is not the caſe; nor is it in
any man's power to lay a reſtraint upon the liberty of theſe birds, that,
when let looſe, put no limits to their excurſions. They feed every where;
upon every man's ground; and no man can ſay, theſe birds are fed only by
me. Thoſe birds which are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by all, belong to all; nor can any one
man, or any ſet of men, lay claim to them, when ſtill continuing in a
ſtate of nature.</p>
               <p>I never walked out about the environs of <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0823900105:231"/>
Paris, that I did not conſider the immenſe quantity of game that was
running almoſt tame on every ſide of me, as a badge of the ſlavery of the
people; and what they wiſhed me to obſerve as an object of triumph, I
always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded with a kind of ſecret compaſſion: yet this people have
no game-laws for the remoter parts of the kingdom; the game is only
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a few places for the king; and is free in moſt places elſe.
In England, the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is general; and the peaſant has not a right to
what even ſlaves, as he is taught to call them, are found to
poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>Of partridges there are two kinds; the grey and the red. The red
partridge is the largeſt of the two, and often perches upon trees; the grey,
with which we are beſt acquainted in England, is moſt prolific, and always
keeps on the ground.</p>
               <p>The partridge ſeems to be a bird well known all over the
world, as it is found in every country, and in every climate; as well in the
frozen regions about the pole, as the torrid tracts under the equator. It even
ſeems to adapt itſelf to the nature of the climate where it reſides. In
Greenland, the partridge, which is brown in ſummer, as ſoon as the icy
winter ſets in, begins to take a covering ſuited to the 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0823900105:232"/> ſeaſon: it is then cloathed with a warm down
beneath; and its outward plumage aſſumes the colour of the ſnows
amongſt which it ſeeks its food. Thus it is doubly fitted for the place, by
the warmth and the colour of its plumage; the one to defend it from the cold,
the other to prevent its being noticed by the enemy. Thoſe of Barakonda, on
the other hand, are longer legged, much ſwifter of foot, and chuſe the
higheſt rocks and precipices to reſide in.</p>
               <p>They all, however, agree in one character, of being immoderately
addicted to venery; and, as ſome writers affirm, often to an unnatural
degree. It is certain, the male will purſue the hen even to her neſt; and
will break, her eggs, rather than not indulge his inclinations. Though the
young ones have kept together in flocks during the winter, when they begin to
pair in ſpring, their ſociety diſperſes; and combats, very terrible
with reſpect to each other, enſue. Their manners, in other circumſtances,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble all thoſe of poultry in general; but their cunning and
inſtincts ſeem ſuperior to thoſe of the larger kinds. Perhaps, as they
live in the very neighbourhood of their enemies, they have more frequent
occaſion to put their little arts in practice; and learn, by habit, the means
of <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0823900105:233"/> evaſion or ſafety. Whenever, therefore, a dog or
other formidable animal approaches their neſt, the female uſes every means
to draw him away. She keeps juſt before him, pretends to be incapable of
flying, juſt hops up and then falls down before him, but never goes off ſo
far as to diſcourage her purſuer. At length, when ſhe has drawn him
entirely away from her ſecret treaſure, ſhe at once takes wing, and
fairly leaves him to gaze after her in deſpair.</p>
               <p>After the danger is over, and the dog with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, ſhe then
calls her young, who aſſemble at once at her cry, and follow where ſhe
leads them. There are generally from ten to fifteen in a covey; and, if
unmoleſted, they live from fifteen to ſeventeen years.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral methods of taking them, as is well known;
that by which they are taken in a net, with a ſetting dog, is the moſt
pleaſant, as well as the moſt ſecure. The dog, as every body knows, is
trained to this exerciſe, by a long courſe of education: by blows and
careſſes he is taught to lie down at the word of command; a partridge is
ſhewn him, and he is then ordered to lie down; he is brought into the field,
and when the ſportſman perceives where the covey lies, he orders his dog to
crouch: at length the <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0823900105:234"/> dog, from habit, crouches wherever
he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches a covey; and this is the ſignal which the ſportſman
receives for unfolding and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the birds with his net. A covey thus
caught, is ſometimes fed in a place proper for their reception; but they can
never be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly tamed, like the reſt of our domeſtic poultry.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. The Quail.</head>
               <p>THE laſt of the poultry kind that I ſhall mention is the
Quail; a bird much ſmaller than any of the former, being not above half the
ſize of a partridge. The feathers of the head are black, edged with ruſty
brown; the breaſt is of a pale yellowiſh red, ſpotted with black; the
feathers on the back are marked with lines of pale yellow, and the legs are of
a pale hue. Except in the colours thus deſcribed, and the ſize, it every
way reſembles a partridge in ſhape; and, except that it is a bird of
paſſage, all others of the poultry kind, in its habits and nature.</p>
               <p>The quail is by all known to be a bird of paſſage; and yet
if we conſider its heavy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of flying, and its dearth of plumage, with
reſpect to its corpulence, we ſhall be ſurprized how a bird ſo
apparently ill qualified for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, ſhould take ſuch extenſive
journeys. Nothing however is more certain: 
<q rend="inline">"When we ſailed from Rhodes to Alexandria,"
ſays Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius, "about autumn, many quails, flying from the north to the
ſouth, were taken in our ſhip; and ſailing at ſpring-time the contrary 
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0823900105:236"/> way, from the ſouth to the north, I obſerved them on
their return, when many of them were taken in the ſame manner."</q> This
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is confirmed by many others; who aver, that they chuſe a north wind
for theſe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the ſouth wind being very unfavourable, as it
retards their flight, by moiſtening their plumage. They then fly two by two;
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, when their way lies over land, to go faſter by night than by
day; and to fly very high, to avoid being ſurprized or ſet upon by birds of
prey. However, it ſtill remains a doubt whether quails take ſuch long
journies as Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius has made them perform. It is now aſſerted by ſome,
that the quail only migrates from one province of a country to another. For
inſtance, in England, they fly from the inland counties, to thoſe bordering
on the ſea, and continue there all the winter. If froſt or ſnow drive
them out of the ſtubble fields or marſhes, they then retreat to the ſea
ſide, ſhelter themſelves among the weeds, and live upon what is thrown up
from the ſea upon ſhore. Particularly in Eſſex, the time of their
appearance upon the coaſts of that country exactly coincides with their
diſappearance from the more internal parts of the kingdom; ſo 
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0823900105:237"/> that what has been ſaid of their long flights, is
probably not ſo well founded as is generally ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are much leſs prolific than the partridge;
ſeldom laying more than ſix or ſeven whitiſh eggs, marked with ragged,
ruſt coloured ſpots. But their ardour in courtſhip yields ſcarce to any
other bird, as they are fierce and cruel at that ſeaſon to each other,
fighting moſt deſperately, and (a puniſhment they richly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve)
being at that time very eaſily taken. Quail-fighting was a favourite
amuſement among the Athenians: they abſtained from the fleſh of this
bird, deeming it unwholeſome, as ſuppoſing that it fed upon the white
hellebore; but they reared great numbers of them, for the pleaſure of
ſeeing them fight; and ſtaked ſums of money, as we do with regard to
cocks, upon the ſucceſs of the combat. Faſhion, however, has at preſent
changed with regard to this bird; we take no pleaſure in its courage, but its
fleſh is conſidered as a very great delicacy.</p>
               <p>Quails are eaſily caught by a call: the fowler, early in the
morning, having ſpread his net, hides himſelf under it, among the corn; he
then imitates the voice of the female, with his quail-pipe, which the cock
hearing, approaches with the utmoſt aſſiduity; when he has got under 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0823900105:238"/> the net, the fowler then diſcovers himſelf, and
terrifies the quail, who attempting to get away, entangles himſelf the more
in the net, and is taken. The quail may thus very well ſerve to illuſtrate
the old adage, that every paſſion, carried to an inordinate exceſs, will
at laſt lead to ruin.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Birds of the Pie Kind.</head>
               <p>IN marſhalling our army of the feathered creation, we have
placed in the van a race of birds long bred to war, and whoſe paſſion is
ſlaughter; in the center we have placed the ſlow and heavy laden, that are
uſually brought into the field to be deſtroyed; we now come to a kind of
light infantry, that partake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſpirit of the two former,
and yet belonging to neither. In this claſs we muſt be content to marſhal
a numerous irregular tribe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly armed, with different purſuits,
appetites, and manners; not formidably formed for war, and yet generally
delighting in miſchief; not ſlowly and uſefully obedient, and yet without
any profeſſed enmity to the reſt of their fellow tenants of air.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak without metaphor, under this claſs of birds we may
arrange all that noiſy, reſtleſs, chattering, teizing tribe that lies
between the hen and the thruſh, that, from the ſize of the raven down to
that of the wood-pecker, flutter round our habitations and, rather with the
ſpirit <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0823900105:241"/> of pilferers than of robbers, make free with
the fruits of human induſtry.</p>
               <p>Of all the other claſſes, this ſeems to be that which the
leaſt contributes to furniſh out the pleaſures or ſupply the
neceſſities of man. The falcon hunts for him; the poultry tribe ſupplies
him with luxurious food; and the little ſparrow race delight him with the
melody of their warblings. The crane kind make a ſtudied variety in his
entertainments; and the claſs of ducks are not only many of them delicate in
their fleſh, but extremely uſeful for their feathers. But in the claſs of
the pie kind there are few except the pidgeon that are any way uſeful. They
ſerve rather to teize man than to aſſiſt or amuſe him. Like
faithleſs ſervants, they are fond of his neighbourhood, becauſe they
moſtly live by his labour; but their chief ſtudy is what they can plunder
in his abſence, while their deaths make him no atonement for their
depredation.</p>
               <p>But though, with reſpect to man, this whole claſs is rather
noxious than beneficial; though he may conſider them in this light, as
falſe, noiſy, troubleſome neighbours, yet, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to each other,
no claſs of birds are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, ſo active, or ſo well fitted for
ſociety. Could we ſuppoſe a kind of morality among <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0823900105:242"/>
birds, we ſhould find that theſe are by far the moſt induſtrious, the
moſt faithful, the moſt conſtant, and the moſt connubial. The rapacious
kinds drive out their young before they are fit to ſtruggle with adverſity;
but the pie kind cheriſh their young to the laſt. The poultry claſs are
faithleſs and promiſcuous in their courtſhip; but theſe live in pairs,
and their attachments are wholly confined to each other. The ſparrow kind
frequently overleap the bounds of Nature and make illicit varieties; but
theſe never. They live in harmony with each other; every ſpecies is true to
its kind, and tranſmits an unpolluted race to poſterity.</p>
               <p>As other kinds build in rocks or upon the ground, the chief
place where theſe build is in trees or buſhes; the male takes his ſhare
in the labours of building the neſt; and often relieves his mate in the
duties of incubation. Both take this office by turns; and when the young are
excluded, both are equally active in making them an ample proviſion.</p>
               <p>They ſometimes live in ſocieties; and in theſe there are
general laws obſerved, and a kind of republican form of government
eſtabliſhed among them. They watch not only for the general ſafety, but
for that of every other bird of the grove. How often have we ſeen a fowler, 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0823900105:243"/> ſtealing in upon a flock of ducks or wild geeſe,
diſturbed by the alarming note of a crow or a magpie: its ſingle voice gave
the whole thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs tribe warning, and taught them in good time to look to
their ſafety.</p>
               <p>Nor are theſe birds leſs remarkable for their inſtincts
than their capacity for inſtruction. There is an apparent cunning or
archneſs in the look of the whole tribe; and I have ſeen crows and ravens
taught to fetch and carry with the docility of a ſpaniel. Indeed, it is often
an exerciſe that without teaching all this tribe are but too fond of. Every
body knows what a paſſion they have for ſhining ſubſtances and ſuch
toys as ſome of us put a value upon. A whole family has been alarmed at the
loſs of a ring; every ſervant has been accuſed, and every creature in the
houſe, conſcious of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, ſuſpected each other, when,
to the utter ſurprize of all, it has been found in the neſt of a tame
magpie or a jack-daw that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had ever thought of.</p>
               <p>However, as this claſs is very numerous, it is not to be
ſuppoſed that the manners are alike in all. Some, ſuch as the pidgeon,
are gentle and ſerviceable to man; others are noxious, capricious, and
noiſy. In a few ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral characters they all agree; namely, in 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0823900105:244"/> having hoarſe voices, ſlight active bodies, and a
facility of flight, that baffles even the boldeſt of the rapacious kinds in
the purſuit. I will begin with thoſe birds which moſt properly may be
ſaid to belong to this claſs, and go on till I finiſh with the pidgeon,
an harmleſs bird, that reſembles this tribe in little elſe except their
ſize, and that ſeems to be the ſhade uniting the pie and the ſparrow
kind into one general picture.</p>
               <p>It is not to be expected that in this ſketch of the great
magazine of Nature we can ſtop ſingly to contemplate every object. To
deſcribe the number that offers would be tedious, and the ſimilitude that
one bears another would make the hiſtory diſguſting. As an hiſtorian in
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the actions of ſome noble people does not ſtop to give the
character of every private man in the army, but only of ſuch as have been
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by their conduct, courage, or treachery; ſo ſhould the
hiſtorian of Nature only ſeize upon the moſt ſtriking objects before
him; and, having given one common account of the moſt remarkable, refer the
peculiarities of the reſt to their general deſcription.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Raven, the Crow, and their
Affinities.</head>
               <p>THE raven, the carrion-crow, and the rook, are birds ſo well
known, that a long deſcription would but obſcure our ideas of them. The
raven is the largeſt of the three, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt not
only by his ſize, but by his bill being ſomewhat more hooked than that of
the reſt. As for the carrion-crow and the rook, they ſo ſtrongly
reſemble each other, both in make and ſize, that they are not eaſily
diſtinguiſhed aſunder. The chief difference to be found between them lies
in the bill of the rook; which, by frequently being thruſt into the ground to
fetch out grubs and earth-worms, is bare of feathers as far as the eyes, and
appears of a whitiſh colour. It differs alſo in the purple ſplendour or
gloſs of its feathers, which in the carrion-crow are of a more dirty black.
Nor is it amiſs to make theſe diſtinctions, as the rook has but too
frequently ſuffered for its ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the carrion-crow; and thus an
harmleſs bird, that feeds only upon inſects and corn, has been deſtroyed
for another that feeds upon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, and is often deſtructive among young
poultry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0823900105:246"/>The manners of the raven and the
carrion-crow are exactly ſimilar; they both feed upon carrion; they fly only
in pairs; and will deſtroy other birds if they can take them by ſurprize.
But it is very different with the rook, the daw, and the Corniſh chough,
which may be all ranked in this order. They are ſociable and harmleſs; they
live only upon inſects and grain; and wherever they are, inſtead of
injuring other birds, they ſeem centinels for the whole feathered creation.
It will be proper, therefore, to deſcribe theſe two ſorts according to
their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective appetites, as they have nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon but the very
ſtrong ſimilitude they bear to each other in their colour and
formation.</p>
               <p>The raven is a bird found in every region of the world: ſtrong
and hardy, he is uninfluenced by the changes of the weather; and when other
birds ſeem numbed with cold, or pining with famine, the raven is active and
healthy, buſily employed in prowling for prey, or ſporting in the coldeſt
atmoſphere. As the heats at the line do not oppreſs him, ſo he bears the
cold of the polar countries with equal indifference. He is ſometimes indeed
ſeen milk white; and this may probably be the effect of the rigorous
cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the north. It is moſt likely that this change is wrought upon
him as upon moſt other <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0823900105:247"/> animals in that part of the
world, where their robes, particularly in winter, aſſume the colour of the
country they inhabit. As in old age, when the natural heat decays, the hair
grows grey, and at laſt white, ſo among theſe animals the cold of the
climate may produce a ſimilar languiſhment of colour, and may ſhut up
thoſe pores that conveyed the tincturing fluids to the extremeſt parts of
the body.</p>
               <p>However this may be, white ravens are often ſhown among us,
which, I have heard ſome ſay, are rendered thus by art; and this we could
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſuppoſe if they were as eaſily changed in their colour as they
are altered in their habits and diſpoſitions. A raven may be reclaimed to
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every purpoſe to which birds can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. He may be trained
up for fowling like an hawk; he may be taught to fetch and carry like a
ſpaniel; he may be taught to ſpeak like a parrot; but the moſt
extraordinary of all is, that he can be taught to ſing like a man. I have
heard a raven ſing the Black Joke with great diſtinctneſs, truth, and
humour.</p>
               <p>Indeed, when the raven is taken as a domeſtic, he has many
qualities that render him extremely amuſing. Buſy, inquiſitive, and
impudent, he goes every where, affronts and drives off the dogs, plays his
pranks on the poultry, and is <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0823900105:248"/> particularly aſſiduous
in cultivating the good will of the cook-maid, who ſeems to be the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of the family. But then, with the amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualities of a favourite, he often
alſo has the vices and defects. He is a glutton by nature, and a thief by
habit. He does not confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to petty depredations on the pantry or
the larder; he ſoars at more magnificent plunder; at ſpoils that he can
neither exhibit nor enjoy; but which, like a miſer, he reſts ſatisfied
with having the ſatisfaction of ſometimes viſiting and contemplating in
ſecret. A piece of money, a tea-ſpoon, or a ring, are always tempting baits
to his avarice; theſe he will ſlily ſeize upon, and if not watched will
carry to his favourite hole.</p>
               <p>In his wild ſtate, the raven is an active and greedy
plunderer. Nothing comes amiſs to him; whether his prey be living or long
dead it is all the ſame, he falls to with a voracious appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; and when he
has gorged himſelf, flies to acquaint his fellows that they may participate
of the ſpoil. If the carcaſe be already in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of
ſome more powerful animal, a wolf, a fox, or a dog, the raven ſits at a
little diſtance, content to continue an humble ſpectator till they have
done. If in his flights he perceives no hopes of carrion, and his ſcent is
ſo exquiſite <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0823900105:249"/> that he can ſmell it at a vaſt
diſtance, he then contents himſelf with more unſavory food, fruits,
inſects, and the accidental deſert of a dunghill.</p>
               <p>This bird chiefly builds its neſt in trees, and lays five or
ſix eggs of a pale green colour, marked with ſmall browniſh ſpots. They
live ſometimes in pairs, and ſometimes they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in great numbers the
neighbourhood of populous cities, where they are uſeful in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring thoſe
carcaſes that would otherwiſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefy and infect the air. They build in
high trees or old towers, in the beginning of March with us in England, and
ſometimes ſooner, as the ſpring is more or leſs advanced for the
ſeaſon. But it is not always near towns that they fix their retreats: they
often build in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented places, and drive all other birds from their
vicinity. They will not permit even their young to keep in the ſame
diſtrict, but drive them off when they are ſufficiently able to ſhift for
themſelves. Martin, in his deſcription of the Weſtern Iſles, avers,
that there are three little iſlands among the number which are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by a
pair of ravens each, that drive off all other birds with great cries and
impetuoſity.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the injury theſe birds do in picking out the
eyes of ſheep and lambs, when <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0823900105:250"/> they find them ſick
and helpleſs, a vulgar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is paid them as being the birds that fed
the prophet Elijah in the wilderneſs. This prepoſſeſſion in favour of
the raven is of very ancient date, as the Romans themſelves, who thought the
bird ominous, paid it from motives of fear the moſt profound veneration. One
of theſe that had been kept in the temple of Caſtor, as Pliny informs us,
flew down into the ſhop of a taylor, who took much delight in the viſits of
his new acquaintance. He taught the bird ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tricks; but particularly to
pronounce the names of the emperor Tiberius and the whole royal family. The
taylor was beginning to grow rich by thoſe who came to ſee this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
raven, till an envious neighbour, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at the taylor's ſucceſs,
killed the bird, and deprived the taylor of his future hopes of fortune. The
Romans, however, took the poor taylor's part; they puniſhed the man who
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the injury, and gave the raven all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of a magnificent
interment.</p>
               <p>Birds in general live longer than quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes; and the raven is
ſaid to be one of the moſt long-lived of the number. Heſiod aſſerts
that a raven will live nine times as long as a man; but though this is
fabulous, it is certain that ſome of them have been known to live near 
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0823900105:251"/> an hundred years. This animal ſeems poſſeſſed
of thoſe qualities that generally produce lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity, a good appetite and
great exerciſe. In clear weather, the ravens fly in pairs to a great height,
making a deep loud noiſe, different from that of their uſual croaking.</p>
               <p>The carrion-crow reſembles the raven in its appetites, its
laying, and manner of bringing up its young. It only differs in being leſs
bold, leſs docile, and leſs favoured by mankind.</p>
               <p>The rook leads the way in another, but a more harmleſs train,
that have no carnivorous appetites, but only feed upon inſects and corn. The
royſton crow is about the ſize of the two former. The breaſt, belly,
back, and upper part of the neck, being of a pale aſh-colour; the head and
wings gloſſed over with a fine blue. He is a bird of paſſage,
viſiting this kingdom in the beginning of winter and leaving it in the
ſpring. He breeds, however, in different parts of the Britiſh dominions;
and his neſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enough in trees in Ireland. The jack-daw is black,
like all the former, but aſh-coloured on the breaſt and belly. He is not
above the ſize of a pigeon. He is docile and loquacious. His head being large
for the ſize of his body, which, as has been remarked, argues him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
and crafty. He builds in ſteeples, old <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0823900105:252"/> caſtles, and
high rocks, laying five or ſix eggs in a ſeaſon. The Corniſh chough is
like a jack-daw, but bigger, and almoſt the ſize of a crow. The feet and
legs are long like thoſe of a jack-daw, but of a red colour; and the plumage
is black all over. It frequents rocks, old caſtles, and churches, by the
ſea-ſide, like the daw; and with the ſame noiſy aſſiduity. It is
only ſeen along the weſtern coaſts of England. Theſe are birds very
ſimilar in their manners, feeding on grain and inſects, living in
ſociety, and often ſuffering general caſtigation from the flock for the
good of the community.</p>
               <p>The rook, as is well known, builds in woods and foreſts in the
neighbourhood of man, and ſometimes makes choice of groves in the very
midſt of cities for the place of its retreat and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. In theſe it
eſtabliſhes a kind of legal conſtitution, by which all intruders are
excluded from coming to live among them, and none ſuffered to build but
acknowledged natives of the place. I have often amuſed myſelf with
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their plan of policy from my window in the Temple, that looks upon
a grove where they have made a colony in the midſt of the city. At the
commencement of ſpring, the rookery, which during the continuance of winter
ſeemed to have been deſerted, or only <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0823900105:253"/> guarded by
about five or ſix, like old ſoldiers in a garriſon, now begins to be once
more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented; and in a ſhort time all the buſtle and hurry of
buſineſs is fairly commenced. Where theſe numbers reſided during the
winter is not eaſy to gueſs; perhaps in the trees of hedge-rows to be
nearer their food. In ſpring, however, they cultivate their native trees;
and, in the places where they were themſelves hatched, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to
propagate a future progeny.</p>
               <p>They keep together in pairs; and when the offices of courtſhip
are over, they prepare for making their neſts and laying. The old
inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the place are all already provided; the neſt which ſerved
them for years before, with a little trimming and dreſſing will ſerve
very well again; the difficulty of neſtling lies only upon the young ones who
have no neſt, and muſt therefore get up one as well as they can. But not
only the materials are wanting, but alſo the place in which to fix it. Every
part of a tree will not do for this purpoſe, as ſome branches may not be
ſufficiently forked; others may not be ſufficiently ſtrong; and ſtill
others may be too much expoſed to the rockings of the wind. The male and
female upon this occaſion are, for ſome days, ſeen examining all the
trees of the grove very attentively; and <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0823900105:254"/> when they have
fixed upon a branch that ſeems fit for their purpoſe, they continue to fit
upon and obſerve it very ſedulouſly for two or three days longer. The
place being thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon, they begin to gather the materials for their
neſt; ſuch as ſticks and fibrous roots, which they regularly diſpoſe
in the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial manner. But here a new and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
obſtacle ariſes. It often happens that the young couple have made choice of
a place too near the manſion of an older pair, who do not chuſe to be
incommoded by ſuch trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome neighbours. A quarrel therefore inſtantly
enſues; in which the old ones are always vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</p>
               <p>The young couple, thus expelled, are obliged again to go through
the fatigues of deliberating, examining, and chuſing; and having taken care
to keep their due diſtance, the neſt begins again, and their induſtry
deſerves commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But their alacrity is often too great in the
beginning; they ſoon grow weary of bringing the materials of their neſt
from diſtant places; and they very eaſily perceive that ſticks may be be
provided nearer home, with leſs honeſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but ſome degree of
addreſs. Away they go, therefore, to pilfer as faſt as they can; and
wherever they ſee a neſt unguarded, they take care to rob it of the very
choiceſt ſticks of <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0823900105:255"/> which it is compoſed. But
theſe thefts never go unpuniſhed; and probably upon complaint being made
there is a general puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. I have ſeen eight or ten rooks
come upon ſuch occaſions, and ſetting upon the new neſt of the young
couple all at once, tear it in pieces in a moment.</p>
               <p>At length, therefore, the young pair find the neceſſity of
going more regularly and honeſtly to work. While one flies to fetch the
materials, the other ſits upon the tree to guard it; and thus in the ſpace
of three or four days, with a ſkirmiſh now and then between, the pair have
fitted up a commodious neſt compoſed of ſticks without, and of fibrous
roots and long graſs within. From the inſtant the female begins to lay, all
hoſtilities are at an end; not one of the whole grove, that a little before
treated her ſo rudely, will now venture to moleſt her; ſo that ſhe
brings forth her brood with patient tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Such is the ſeverity with
which even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive rooks are treated by each other; but if a foreign rook
ſhould attempt to make himſelf a denizen of their ſociety, he would meet
with no favour; the whole grove would at once be up in arms againſt him, and
expel him without mercy.</p>
               <p>In ſome countries theſe birds are conſidered as a benefit,
in others as a nuiſance: their chief <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0823900105:256"/> food is the worm
of the dorbeetle and corn; thus they may be ſaid to do as much ſervice by
deſtroying that noxious inſect, as they do injury by conſuming the
produce of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman's induſtry.</p>
               <p>To this tribe of the crow-kind, ſome foreign ſorts might be
added: I will take notice only of one, which from the extraordinary ſize and
faſhion of its bill muſt not be paſſed in ſilence. This is the Calao,
or horned Indian raven, which exceeds the common raven in ſize, and habits of
depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. But what he differs in from all other birds is the beak, which,
by its length and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vature at the end, appears deſigned for rapine; but
then it has a kind of horn ſtanding out from the top, which looks ſomewhat
like a ſecond bill, and gives this bird, otherwiſe fierce and ugly, a very
formidable appearance. The horn ſprings out of the forehead, and grows to the
upper part of the bill, being of great bulk; ſo that near the forehead it is
four inches broad, not unlike the horn of the rhinoceros, but more crooked at
the tip. Were the body of the bird anſwerable in ſize to the head, the
calao would exceed in magnitude even the vulture or the eagle. But the head and
beak are out of all proportion, the body being not much larger than that of a
hen. Yet even here there are varieties; for in ſuch of thoſe birds as come 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0823900105:257"/> from different parts of Africa, the body is
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the beak; in ſuch as come from the Molucca Iſlands, the
beak bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the body. Of what uſe this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
excreſcence is to the bird is not eaſy to determine; it lives, like others
of its kind, upon carrion, and ſeldom has a living enemy to cope with: Nature
ſeems to ſport in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of many animals, as if ſhe were willing
to exhibit inſtances as well of variety as oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy in their formation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the Magpie and its Affinities.</head>
               <p>THERE are ſuch a variety of birds that may be diſtributed
under this head, that we muſt not expect very preciſe ideas of any. To have
a ſtraight ſtrong bill, legs formed for hopping, a body of about the ſize
of a magpie, and party coloured plumage, are the only marks by which I muſt
be contented to diſtinguiſh this nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous phantaſtic tribe, that add to
the beauty, though not to the harmony of our landſcapes. In fact, their
chattering every where diſturbs the melody of the leſſer warblers; and
their noiſy courtſhip not a little damps the ſong of the linnet and the
nightingale.</p>
               <p>However, we have very few of this kind in our woods compared to
thoſe in the neighbourhood of the line. There they not only paint the ſcene
with the beauty and the variety of their plumage, but ſtun the ear with their
vociferation. In thoſe luxurious foreſts, the ſinging birds are ſcarce
ever heard, but a hundred varieties of the pie, the jay, the roller, the
chatterer and the toucan, are continually in motion, and with their illuſive
mockeries diſturb or divert the ſpectator, as he happens to be
diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0823900105:259"/>The magpie is the chief of this kind with
us, and is too well known to need a deſcription. Indeed, were its other
accompliſhments equal to its beauty, few birds could be put in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition.
Its black, its white, its green and purple, with the rich and gilded
combination of the gloſſes on its tail, are as fine as any that adorn the
moſt beautiful of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered tribe. But it has too many of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of a beau, to depreciate theſe natural perfections: vain, reſtleſs, loud,
and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, it is an unwelcome intruder every where; and never
miſſes an opportunity, when it finds one, of doing miſchief.</p>
               <p>The magpie bears a great reſemblance to the butcher-bird in
its bill, which has a ſharp pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs near the end of the upper chap, as
well as in the ſhortneſs of its wings, and the form of the tail, each
feather ſhortening from the two middlemoſt. But it agrees ſtill more in
its food, living not only upon worms and inſects, but alſo upon ſmall
birds when they can be ſeized. A wounded lark, or a young chicken ſeparated
from the hen, are ſure plunder; and the magpie will even ſometimes ſet
upon and ſtrike a black-bird.</p>
               <p>The ſame inſolence prompts it to teize the largeſt animals
when its inſults can be offered <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0823900105:260"/> with ſecurity. They
often are ſeen perched upon the back of an ox or a ſheep, pecking up the
inſects to be found there, chattering and tormenting the poor animal at the
ſame time, and ſtretching out their necks for combat, if the beaſt turns
its head backward to reprehend them. They ſeek out alſo the neſts of
birds; and, if the parent eſcapes, the eggs make up for the deficiency: the
thruſh and the black-bird are but too frequently robbed by this
aſſaſſin, and this in ſome meaſure cauſes their ſcarcity.</p>
               <p>No food ſeems to come amiſs to this bird; it ſhares with
ravens in their carrion, with rooks in their grain, and with the cuckoo in
bird's eggs: but it ſeems poſſeſſed of a providence ſeldom uſual
with gluttons; for when it is ſatisfied for the preſent, it lays up the
remainder of the feaſt for another occaſion. It will even in a tame ſtate
hide its food when it has done eating, and after a time return to the ſecret
hoard with renewed appetite and vociferation.</p>
               <p>In all its habits it diſcovers a degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
unuſual to other birds. Its neſt is not leſs remarkable for the manner in
which it is compoſed than for the place the magpie takes to build it in. The
neſt is uſually placed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous enough, either in the middle of
ſome <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0823900105:261"/> hawthorn buſh, or on the top of ſome high
tree. The place, however, is always found difficult of acceſs; for the tree
pitched upon uſually grows in ſome thick hedge-row, fenced by brambles at
the root; or ſometimes one of the higher buſhes is fixed upon for the
purpoſe. When the place is thus choſen as inacceſſible as poſſible
to men, the next care is to fence the neſt above ſo as to defend it from
all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enemies of air. The kite, the crow, and the ſparrow-hawk,
are to be guarded againſt; as their neſts have been ſometimes plundered
by the magpie, ſo it is reaſonably feared that they will take the firſt
opportunity to retaliate. To prevent this, the magpie's neſt is built with
ſurprizing labour and ingenuity.</p>
               <p>The body of the neſt is compoſed of hawthorn branches; the
thorns ſticking outward, but well united together by their mutual
inſertions. Within it is lined with fibrous roots, wool, and long graſs,
and then nicely plaiſtered all round with mud and clay. The body of the
neſt being thus made firm and commodious, the next work is to make the canopy
which is to defend it above. This is compoſed of the ſharpeſt thorns,
wove together in ſuch a manner as to deny all entrance except at the door,
which is juſt large enough to permit egreſs and <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0823900105:262"/>
regreſs to the owners. In this fortreſs the male and female hatch and bring
up their brood with ſecurity, ſheltered from all attacks but thoſe of the
climbing ſchool-boy, who often finds his torn and bloody hands too dear a
price for the eggs or the young ones. The magpie lays ſix or ſeven eggs, of
a pale green colour, ſpotted with brown.</p>
               <p>This bird, in its domeſtic ſtate, preſerves its natural
character with ſtrict propriety. The ſame noiſy, miſchievous habits
attend it to the cage that marked it in the woods; and being more cunning, ſo
it is alſo a more docile bird than any other taken into keeping. Thoſe who
are deſirous of teaching it to ſpeak, have a fooliſh cuſtom of cutting
its tongue, which only puts the poor animal to pain, without improving its
ſpeech in the ſmalleſt degree. Its ſpeaking is ſometimes very
diſtinct; but its ſounds are too thin and ſharp to be an exact imitation
of the human voice, which the hoarſe raven and parrot can counterfeit more
exactly.</p>
               <p>To this tribe we may refer the Jay, which is one of the moſt
beautiful of the Britiſh birds. The forehead is white, ſtreaked with black;
the head is covered with very long feathers, which it can erect into a creſt
at pleaſure; the whole neck, back, breaſt and belly, are of a 
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0823900105:263"/> faint purple, daſhed with grey; the wings are moſt
beautifully barred with a lovely blue, black and white; the tail is black, and
the feet of a pale brown. Like the magpie, it feeds upon fruits, will kill
ſmall birds, and is extremely docile.</p>
               <p>The Chatterer alſo, which is a native of Germany, may be
placed in this rank; and is ſomewhat leſs than the former. It is variegated
with a beautiful mixture of colours; red, aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, cheſnut and yellow:
but what diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes it from all other birds, are the horny appendages
from the tips of ſeven of the leſſer quill feathers, which ſtand bare
of beards, and have the colour and gloſs of the beſt red ſealing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wax.</p>
               <p>The Roller is not leſs beautiful than any of the former. The
breaſt and belly are blue; the head green; and the wings variegated with
blue, black and white. But it may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all others by a
ſort of naked tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles or warts near the eyes, which ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contribute to encreaſe its beauty.</p>
               <p>To this claſs may be added a numerous liſt from all the
tropical foreſts of the eaſt and weſt; where the birds are remarkable for
diſcordant voices and brilliant plumage. I will fix only upon one, which is
the moſt ſingular of all the <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0823900105:264"/> feathered creation.
This is the Toucan, a bird of the pie kind, whoſe bill is nearly as large as
the reſt of its whole body.</p>
               <p>Of this extraordinary bird there are four or five varieties. I
will only deſcribe the red beaked toucan; and as the figure of this bird
makes the principal part of its hiſtory, I will follow Edwards through all
the minutiae of its ſingular conformation. It is about the ſize of and
ſhaped like a jack-daw, with a large head to ſupport its monſtrous bill:
this bill, from the angles of the mouth to its point, is ſix inches and an
half; and its breadth, in the thickeſt part, is a little more than two. Its
thickneſs near the head, is one inch and a quarter; and it is a little
rounded along the top of the upper chap, the under ſide being round alſo;
the whole of the bill extremely ſlight and a little thicker than parchment.
The upper chap is of a bright yellow, except on each ſide, which is of a fine
ſcarlet colour; as is alſo the lower chap, except at the baſe, which is
purple. Between the head and the bill there is a black line of ſeparation all
round the baſe of the bill; in the upper part of which the noſtrils are
placed, and are almoſt covered with feathers; which has occaſioned ſome
writers to ſay, that <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0823900105:265"/> the toucan has no noſtrils.
Round the eyes, on each ſide of the head, is a ſpace of bluiſh ſkin,
void of feathers, above which the head is black, except a white ſpot on each
ſide joining to the baſe of the upper chap. The hinder part of the neck,
the back, wings, tail, belly and thighs, are black. The under ſide of the
head, throat, and the beginning of the breaſt, are white. Between the white
on the breaſt, and the black on the belly, is a ſpace of red feathers, in
the form of a new moon, with its horns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The legs, feet and claws, are
of an aſh-colour; and the toes ſtand like thoſe of parrots, two before,
and two behind.</p>
               <p>It is reported, by travellers, that this bird, though
furniſhed with ſo formidable a beak, is harmleſs and gentle, being ſo
eaſily made tame, as to ſit and hatch its young in houſes. It feeds
chiefly upon pepper, which it devours very greedily, gorging itſelf in ſuch
a manner, that it voids it crude and unconcocted. This, however, is no
objection to the natives from uſing it again; they even prefer it before that
pepper which is freſh gathered from the tree: and ſeem perſuaded that the
ſtrength and heat of the pepper is qualified by the bird, and that all its
noxious qualities are thus exhauſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0823900105:266"/>Whatever be the truth of this report,
nothing is more certain than that the toucan lives only upon a vegetable diet;
and in a domeſtic ſtate, to which it is frequently brought in the warm
countries where it is bred, it is ſeen to prefer ſuch food to all other.
Pozzo, who bred one tame, aſſerts, that it leaped up and down, wagged the
tail, and cried with a voice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of a magpie. It fed upon the
ſame things that parrots do; but was moſt greedy of grapes, which, being
plucked off one by one, and thrown in the air, it would moſt dexterouſly
catch before they fell to the ground. Its bill, he adds, was hollow, and upon
that account very light, ſo that it had but little ſtrength in ſo
apparently formidable a weapon; nor could it peck or ſtrike ſmartly
therewith. But its tongue ſeemed to aſſiſt the efforts of this unwieldy
machine: it was long, thin and flat, not unlike one of the feathers on the neck
of a dunghill cock; this it moved up and down, and often extended five or ſix
inches from the bill. It was of a fleſh colour, and very remarkably fringed
on each ſide with very ſmall filaments, exactly reſembling a feather.</p>
               <p>It is probable that this long tongue has greater ſtrength than
the thin hollow beak that <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0823900105:267"/> contains it. It is likely that
the beak is only a kind of ſheath for this peculiar inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, uſed by
the toucan, not only in making itſelf a neſt, but alſo in obtaining its
proviſion. Nothing is more certain, than that this bird builds its neſt in
holes of trees, which have been previouſly ſcooped out for this purpoſe;
and it is not very likely that ſo feeble a bill could be very ſerviceable
in working upon ſuch hard materials.</p>
               <p>Be this as it will, there is no bird ſecures its young better
from external injury than the toucan. It has not only birds, men, and
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents to guard againſt, but a numerous tribe of monkies, ſtill more
prying, miſchievous and hungry than all the reſt. The toucan, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſcoops out its neſt into the hollow of ſome tree, leaving only a hole
large enough to go in and out at. There it ſits, with its great beak,
guarding the entrance; and if the monkey ventures to offer a viſit of
curioſity, the toucan gives him ſuch a welcome, that he preſently thinks
proper to pack off, and is glad to eſcape with ſafety.</p>
               <p>This bird is only found in the warm climates of South America,
where it is in great requeſt, both for the delicacy of its fleſh, which is
tender <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0823900105:268"/> and nouriſhing, and for the beauty of its
plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, particularly the feathers of the breaſt. The ſkin of this part
the Indians pluck off, and, when dry, glue to their cheeks; and this they
conſider as an irreſiſtible addition to their beauty.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Wood-pecker and its Affinities.</head>
               <p>WE come now to the numerous tribe of Wood-peckers; a claſs
eaſily diſtinguiſhable from all others, both for their peculiar
forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their method of procuring food, and their manner of providing a
place of ſafety for their young. Indeed, no other claſs of birds ſeems
more immediately formed for the method of life they purſue, being fitted by
nature, at all points, for the peculiarity of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. They live
chiefly upon the inſects contained in the body of trees; and for this
purpoſe are furniſhed with a ſtraight, hard, ſtrong, angular and
ſharp bill, made for pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and boring. They have a tongue of a very great
length; round, ending in a ſharp, ſtiff, bony thorn, dentated on each
ſide, to ſtrike ants and inſects when diſlodged from their cells. Their
legs are ſhort and ſtrong, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of climbing. Their toes
ſtand two forward, and two backward; which is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſerviceable in
holding by branches of trees. They have hard ſtiff tails, to lean upon when
climbing. They feed only upon inſects, <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0823900105:270"/> and want that
inteſtine, which anatomiſts call the caecum; a circumſtance peculiar to
this tribe only.</p>
               <p>Of this bird there are many kinds, and many varieties in each
kind. They form large colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the foreſts of every part of the world.
They differ in ſize, colour, and appearance; and agree only in the marks
above-mentioned, or in thoſe habits which reſult from ſo peculiar a
conformation. Inſtead, therefore, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into a minute
diſcrimination of every ſpecies, let us take one for a pattern, to which
all the reſt will be found to bear the ſtrongeſt affinity. Words can but
feebly deſcribe the plumage of a bird; but it is the province of hiſtory to
enter into a detail of every animal's purſuits and occupations.</p>
               <p>The Green Wood-ſpite or Wood-pecker is called the Rain-Fowl in
ſome parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; becauſe, when it makes a greater noiſe than
ordinary, it is ſuppoſed to foretell rain. It is about the ſize of a jay;
the throat, breaſt and belly are of a pale greeniſh colour; and the back,
neck and covert feathers of the wings are green. But the tongue of this little
animal makes its moſt diſtinguiſhed characteriſtic, as it ſerves for
its ſupport and defence. As was ſaid above, the wood-pecker feeds upon
inſects; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0823900105:271"/> on thoſe which are lodged
in the body of hollow or of rotting trees. The tongue is its inſtrument for
killing and procuring this food; which cannot be found in great plenty. This is
round, ending in a ſtiff, ſharp, bony tip, dentated on both ſides, like
the beard of an arrow; and this it can dart out three or four inches from the
bill, and draw in again at pleaſure. Its prey is thus transfixed, and drawn
into the bill, which, when ſwallowed, the dart is again launched at freſh
game. Nothing has employed the attention of the curious in this part of
anatomy, more than the contrivance by which the tongue of this bird performs
its functions with ſuch great celerity. The tongue is drawn back into the
bill by the help of two ſmall round cartilages, faſtened into the fore
mentioned bony tip, and running along the length of the tongue. Theſe
cartilages, from the root of the tongue, take a circuit beyond the ears; and
being reflected backwards to the crown of the head, make a large bow. The
muſcular, ſpongy fleſh of the tongue, encloſes theſe cartilages, like
a ſheath; and is ſo made, that it may be extended or contracted like a
worm. The cartilages indeed have muſcles accompanying them along their whole
length backwards. But there is ſtill another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0823900105:272"/> for there is a broad muſcle, joining the cartilages to
the bones of the ſkull, which, by contracting or dilating, forces the
cartilages forward through the tongue, and then forces the tongue and all
through the bill, to be employed for the animal's preſervation, in piercing
its prey.</p>
               <p>Such is the inſtrument with which this bird is provided; and
this is the manner in which this inſtrument is employed. When a wood-pecker,
by its natural ſagacity, finds out a rotten hollow tree, where there are
worms, ant's eggs, or inſects, it immediately prepares for its operations.
Reſting by its ſtrong claws, and leaning on the thick feathers of its tail,
it begins to bore with its ſharp ſtrong beak, until it diſcloſes the
whole internal habitation. Upon this, either through pleaſure at the ſight
of its prey, or with a deſire to alarm the inſect colony, it ſends forth
a loud cry, which throws terror and confuſion into the whole inſect tribe.
They creep hither and thither, ſeeking for ſafety; while the bird
luxuriouſly feaſts upon them at leiſure, darting its tongue with unerring
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and devouring the whole brood.</p>
               <p>The wood-pecker, however, does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine its depredations
ſolely to trees, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lights upon the ground, to try its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0823900105:273"/> tune at an ant-hill. It is not ſo ſecure of prey
there as in the former caſe, although the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are much greater. They lie
generally too deep for the bird to come at them; and it is obliged to make up
by ſtratagem the defect of power. The wood-pecker firſt goes to their
hills, which it pecks, in order to call them abroad; it then thruſts out its
long red tongue, which being like a worm, and reſembling their uſual prey,
the ants come out to ſettle upon in great numbers; however, the bird watching
the propereſt opportunity, withdraws its tongue at a jerk, and devours the
devourers. This ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem it continues till it has alarmed their fears; or
till it is quite ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>As the wood pecker is obliged to make holes in trees to procure
food, ſo is it alſo to make cavities ſtill larger to form its neſt and
to lay in. This is performed, as uſual, with the bill; although ſome have
affirmed that the animal uſes its tongue, as a gimblet, to bore with. But
this is a miſtake; and thoſe that are curious, may often hear the noiſe
of the bill making its way in large woods and foreſts. The wood-pecker
chuſes, however, for this purpoſe, trees that are decayed, or wood that is
ſoft, like beech, elm and poplar. In theſe, with very little trouble, it
can make holes as exactly round <pb facs="tcp:0823900105:274"/>

                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0823900105:275"/> as a mathematician could with
compaſſes. One of theſe holes the bird generally chuſes for its own
uſe, to neſtle, and bring up its young in: but as they are eaſily made,
it is delicate in its choice, and often makes twenty before one is found fit to
give entire ſatisfaction. Of thoſe which it has made and deſerted, other
birds, not ſo good borers, and leſs delicate in their choice, take
poſſeſſion. The jay and the ſtarling lay their eggs in theſe holes;
and bats are now and then found in peaceable poſſeſſion. Boys
ſometimes have thruſt in their hands with certain hopes of plucking out a
bird's egg; but, to their great mortification have had their fingers bitten by
a bat at the bottom.</p>
               <p>The wood-pecker takes no care to line its neſt with feathers
or ſtraw; its eggs are depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in the hole, without any thing to keep
them warm, except the heat of the parent's body. Their number is generally five
or ſix; always white, oblong, and of a middle ſize. When the young are
excluded, and before they leave the neſt, they are adorned with a ſcarlet
plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage under the throat, which adds to their beauty.</p>
               <p>In our climate, this bird is contented with ſuch a wainſcot
habitation as has been deſcribed for its young; but in the warmer regions of

to protect and hatch their naſcent progeny. A traveller who walks into the
foreſts of thoſe countries, among the firſt ſtrange objects that excite
curioſity, is ſtruck with the multitude of bird's-neſts hanging at the
extremity of almoſt every branch. Many other kind of birds build in this
manner; but the chief of them are of the wood-pecker kind: and indeed, there is
not, in the whole hiſtory of nature, a more ſingular inſtance of the
ſagacity of thoſe little animals in protecting themſelves againſt
ſuch enemies as they have moſt occaſion to fear. In cultivated countries,
a great part of the caution of the feathered tribe is to hide or defend their
neſts from the invaſions of man, as he is their moſt dreaded enemy. But
in the depth of thoſe remote and ſolitary foreſts, where man is but
ſeldom ſeen, the little bird has nothing to apprehend from man. The parent
is careleſs how much the neſt is expoſed to general notice; ſatisfied
if it be out of the reach of thoſe rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious creatures that live by robbery
and ſurprize. If the monkey or the ſnake can be guarded againſt, the bird
has no other enemies to fear: for this purpoſe, its neſt is built upon the
depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing points of the moſt outward branches of a tall tree, ſuch as the
banana or the plantane. On <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0823900105:279"/> one of thoſe immenſe
trees, is ſeen the moſt various, and the moſt inimical aſſemblage of
creatures that can be imagined. The top is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by monkies of ſome
particular tribe, that drive off all others; lower down twine about the great
trunk numbers of the larger ſnakes, patiently waiting till ſome unwary
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal comes within the ſphere of their activity; and at the edges of the
tree hang theſe artificial neſts, in great abundance, inhabited by birds of
the moſt delightful plumage.</p>
               <p>The neſt is uſually formed in this manner: When the time of
incubation approaches, they fly buſily about, in queſt of a kind of moſs,
called, by the Engliſh inhabitants of thoſe countries, <hi>old man's
beard.</hi> It is a fibrous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not very unlike hair, which
bears being moulded into any form, and ſuffers being glued together. This,
therefore, the little wood-pecker, called by the natives of Braſil, the
Guiratemga, firſt glues by ſome viſcous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, gathered in the
foreſt, to the extremeſt branch of a tree; then building downward, and
ſtill adding freſh materials to thoſe already procured, a neſt is
formed, that depends, like a pouch, from the point of the branch: the hole to
enter at, is on the ſide; and all the interior parts are lined with the finer
fibres of the ſame ſubſtance, which compoſe the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0823900105:280"/>Such is the general contrivance of theſe
hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neſts; which are made, by ſome other birds, with ſtill
ſuperior art. A little bird of the Groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beak kind, in the Philippine
iſlands, makes its neſt in ſuch a manner that there is no opening but
from the bottom. At the bottom the bird enters, and goes up through a funnel,
like a chimney, till it comes to the real door of the neſt, which lies on one
ſide, and only opens into this funnel.</p>
               <p>Some birds glue their neſt to the leaf of the banana-tree,
which makes two ſides of their little habitation; while the other two are
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially compoſed by their own induſtry. But theſe, and all of the
kind, are built with the ſame precautions to guard the young againſt the
depredations of monkies and ſerpents, which abound in every tree. The neſt
hangs there, before the ſpoilers, a tempting object, which they can only gaze
upon, while the bird flies in and out, without danger or moleſtation, from
ſo formidable a vicinity.</p>

                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0823900105:282"/> THERE are few birds that have more
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and puzzled the learned than this. Some have deſcribed it as an
inhabitant of the air, living only upon the dew of heaven, and never reſting
below; others have acquieſced in the latter part of its hiſtory, but have
given it flying inſects to feed on. Some have aſſerted that it was
without feet, and others have ranked it among the birds of prey.</p>
               <p>The great beauty of this bird's plumage, and the deformity of
its legs, ſeem to have given riſe to moſt of theſe erroneous reports.
The native ſavages of the Molucca Iſlands, of which it is an inhabitant,
were very little ſtudious of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hiſtory; and, perceiving the
inclination the Europeans had for this beautiful bird, carefully cut off its
legs before they brought it to market; thus concealing its greateſt
deformity, they conſidered themſelves entitled to riſe in their demands
when they offered it for ſale. One deceit led on to another; the buyer
finding the bird without legs, naturally enquired after them; and the ſeller
as naturally began to aſſert that it <pb facs="tcp:0823900105:283"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">

                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0823900105:285"/> had
none. Thus far the European was impoſed upon by others; in all the reſt he
impoſed upon himſelf. Seeing ſo beautiful a bird without legs, he
concluded that it could live only in air, where legs were unneceſſary. The
extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſplendour of its plumage aſſiſted this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and
as it had heavenly beauty, ſo it was aſſerted to have an heavenly
reſidence. From thence its name, and all the falſe reports that have been
propagated concerning it.</p>
               <p>Error, however, is ſhort-lived; and time has diſcovered that
this bird not only has legs, but very large ſtrong ones for its ſize.
Credulity when undeceived runs into the oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; and ſoon after
this harmleſs bird was branded with the character of being rapacious, of
deſtroying all thoſe of ſmaller ſize, and, from the amazing rapidity of
its flight, as qualified peculiarly for extenſive rapine. The real hiſtory
of this pretty animal is at preſent tolerably well known; and it is found to
be as harmleſs as it is beautiful.</p>
               <p>There are two kinds of the bird of Paradiſe; one about the
ſize of a pigeon, which is more common; the other not much larger than a
lark, which has been deſcribed more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. They are both
ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from all other birds, not only by the
ſuperior <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0823900105:286"/> vivacity of their tints, but by the feathers
of the tail, there being two long ſlender filaments growing from the upper
part of the rump, theſe are longer than the bird's body, and bearded only at
the end. By this mark the bird of Paradiſe may be eaſily known, but ſtill
more eaſily by its gaudy livery, which being ſo very brilliant, demands to
be minutely deſcribed.</p>
               <p>This bird appears to the eye as large as a pigeon, though in
reality the body is not much greater than that of a thruſh. The tail, which
is about ſix inches, is as long as the body; the wings are large compared
with the bird's other dimenſions. The head, the throat and the neck are of a
pale gold colour. The baſe of the bill is ſurrounded by black feathers, as
alſo the ſide of the head and throat, as ſoft as velvet, and changeable
like thoſe on the neck of a mallard. The hinder part of the head is of a
ſhining green, mixed with gold. The body and wings are chiefly covered with
beautiful brown, purple and gold feathers. The upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the tail
feathers are of a pale yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and thoſe under them white and longer than
the former; for which reaſon the hinder part of the tail appears to be all
white. But what chiefly excites curioſity are, the two long naked feathers
above-mentioned, which ſpring <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0823900105:287"/> from the upper part of
the rump above the tail, and which are uſually about three feet long. Theſe
are bearded only at the beginning and the end; the whole ſhaft for above two
feet nine inches being of a deep black, while the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered extremity is of a
changeable colour, like the mallard's neck.</p>
               <p>This bird, which for beauty exceeds all others of the pie kind,
is a native of the Molucca Iſlands, but found in greateſt numbers in that
of Aro. There, in the delightful and ſpicy woods of the country, do theſe
beautiful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fly in large flocks; ſo that the groves which produce
the richeſt ſpices produce the fineſt birds alſo. The inhabitants
themſelves are not inſenſible of the pleaſure theſe afford, and give
them the name of God's birds, as being ſuperior to all others that he has
made. They live in large flocks, and at night generally perch upon the ſame
tree. They are called by ſome, the Swallows of Ternate, from their rapid
flight, and from their being continually on the wing in purſuit of inſects,
their uſual prey.</p>
               <p>As the country where they are bred has its tempeſtuous
ſeaſon, when rains and thunders continually diſturb the atmoſphere,
theſe birds are then but ſeldom ſeen. It is thought that 
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0823900105:288"/> they then fly to other countries where their food
appears in greater abundance; for, like ſwallows, they have their ſtated
times of return. In the beginning of the month of Auguſt, they are ſeen in
great numbers flying together; and, as the inhabitants would have us believe,
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their king, who is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by the luſtre
of his plumage, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and veneration which is paid him. In the
evening they perch upon the higheſt trees of the foreſt, particularly one
which bears a red berry, upon which they ſometimes feed, when other food
fails them. In what manner they breed, or what may be the number of their
young, as yet remains for diſcovery.</p>
               <p>The natives, who make a trade of killing and ſelling theſe
birds to the Europeans, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceal themſelves in the trees where they
reſort, and having covered themſelves up from ſight in a bower made of
the branches, they ſhoot at the birds with reedy arrows; and, as they
aſſert, if they happen to kill the king, they then have a good chance for
killing the greateſt part of the flock. The chief mark by which they know the
king is by the ends of the feathers in his tail, which have eyes like thoſe
of a peacock. When they have taken a number <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0823900105:289"/> of theſe
birds, their uſual method is to gut them and cut off their legs; they then
run a hot iron into the body, which dries up the internal moiſture; and
filling the cavity with ſalts and ſpices, they ſell them to the Europeans
for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect trifle.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. The Cuckoo and its Varieties.</head>
               <p>FROM a bird of which many fables have been reported, we paſs
to another that has not given leſs ſcope to fabulous invention. The note of
the cuckoo is known to all the world; the hiſtory and nature of the bird
itſelf ſtill remains in great obſcurity. That it devours its parent, that
it changes its nature with the ſeaſon, and becomes a ſparrow-hawk, were
fables invented of this bird, and are now ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently refuted. But where it
reſides in winter, or how it provides for its ſupply during that
ſeaſon, ſtill continues undiſcovered.</p>
               <p>This ſingular bird, which is ſomewhat leſs than a pigeon,
ſhaped like a magpie, and of a greyiſh colour, is diſtinguiſhed from
all other birds, by its round prominent noſtrils. Having diſappeared all
the winter, it diſcovers itſelf in our country early in the ſpring, by
its well known call. Its note is heard earlier or later as the ſeaſon
ſeems to be more or leſs forward, and the weather more or leſs inviting.
From the chearful voice of this bird the farmer may be inſtructed in the real
advancement of the year. <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0823900105:291"/> The fallibility of human
calendars is but too well known; but from this bird's note the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
may be taught when to ſow his moſt uſeful ſeeds, and do ſuch work as
depends upon a certain temperature of the air. Theſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered guides come
to us heaven-taught, and point out the true commencement of the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The cuckoo, that was ſilent ſome time after its appearance,
begins at firſt feebly, and at very diſtant intervals, to give its call,
which, as the ſummer advances, improves both in its frequency and loudneſs.
This is an invitation to courtſhip, and uſed only by the male, who ſits
generally perched upon ſome dead tree, or bare bough, and repeats his ſong,
which he loſes as ſoon as the genial ſeaſon is over. His note is
pleaſant though uniform; and, from an aſſociation of ideas, ſeldom
occurs to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory without reminding us of the ſweets of ſummer.
Cuſtom too has affixed a more ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous aſſociation to this note; which,
however, we that are batchelors need be in no pain about. This reproach ſeems
to ariſe from this bird's making uſe of the bed or neſt of another to
depoſit its own brood in.</p>
               <p>However this may be, nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than that the
female makes no neſt of her own. She repairs for that purpoſe to the neſt
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0823900105:292"/> of ſome other bird, generally the water-wagtail or
hedge ſparrow, and, having devoured the eggs of the owner, lays her own in
their place. She uſually lays but one, which is ſpeckled, and of the ſize
of a blackbird's. This the fond fooliſh bird hatches with great
aſſiduity, and, when excluded, finds no difference in the great ill-looking
changeling from her own. To ſupply this voracious creature, the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
nurſe toils with unuſual labour, no way ſenſible that ſhe is feeding
up an enemy to her race, and one of the moſt deſtructive robbers of her
future progeny.</p>
               <p>It was once doubted whether theſe birds were carnivorous; but
Reaumur was at the pains of breeding up ſeveral, and found that they would
not feed upon bread or corn; but fleſh and inſects were their favourite
nouriſhment. He found it a very difficult taſk to teach them to peck; for
he was obliged to feed them for a full month, after they were grown as big as
the mother. Inſects, however, ſeemed to be their peculiar food when young;
for they devoured fleſh by a kind of conſtraint, as it was always put into
their mouths; but meal-worm inſects they flew to, and ſwallowed of their
own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord moſt greedily. Indeed, their gluttony is not to be wondered at,
when we conſider the <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0823900105:293"/> capacity of their ſtomach,
which is enormous, and reaches from the breaſt-bone to the vent. It is partly
membranous, partly muſcular, and of a prodigious capacity; yet ſtill they
are not to be ſuppoſed as birds of prey, for they have neither the
ſtrength nor the courage. On the contrary, they are naturally weak and
fearful, as appears by their flying from ſmall birds which every where
purſue them. The young birds are brown mixed with black; and in that ſtate
they have been deſcribed by ſome authors as old ones.</p>
               <p>The cuckoo, when fledged and fitted for flight, follows its
ſuppoſed parent but for a little time; its appetites for inſect food
encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it finds no great chance for a ſupply in imitating its
little inſtructor, it parts good friends, the ſtep-child ſeldom offering
any violence to its nurſe. Nevertheleſs, all the little birds of the grove
ſeem to conſider the young cuckoo as an enemy, and revenge the cauſe of
their kind by their repeated inſults. They purſue it wherever it flies, and
oblige it to take ſhelter in the thickeſt branches of ſome neighbouring
tree. All the ſmaller birds form the train of its purſuers; but the
wry-neck, in particular, is found the moſt active in the chaſe; and from
thence it has been called by many <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0823900105:294"/> the cuckoo's attendant
and provider. But it is very far from following with a friendly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it
only purſues as an inſulter, or a ſpy, to warn all its little companions
of the cuckoo's depredations.</p>
               <p>Such are the manners of this bird while it continues to
reſide, or to be ſeen amongſt us. But early, at the approach of winter,
it totally diſappears, and its paſſage can be traced to no other counrty.
Some ſuppoſe that it lies hid in hollow trees; and others that it
paſſes into warmer climates. Which of theſe opinions is true is very
uncertain, as there are no facts related on either ſide that can be totally
relied on. To ſupport the opinion that they remain torpid during the winter,
at home, Willoughby introduces the following ſtory, which he delivers upon
the credit of another. 
<q rend="inline">"The ſervants of a gentleman, in the country,
having ſtocked up, in one of their meadows, ſome old dry rotten willows,
thought proper, on a certain occaſion, to carry them home. In heating a
ſtove, two logs of this timber were put into the furnace beneath, and fire
applied as uſual. But ſoon, to the great ſurprize of the family, was
heard the voice of a cuckoo, ſinging three times from under the ſtove.
Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at ſo extraordinary a cry in winter <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0823900105:295"/> time,
the ſervants ran and drew the willow logs from the furnace, and in the
midſt one of them ſaw ſomething move: wherefore, taking an ax, they
opened the hole, and thruſting in their hands, firſt they plucked out
nothing but feathers; afterwards they got hold of a living animal; and this was
the cuckoo that had waked ſo very opportunely for its own ſafety. It was,
indeed," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues our hiſtorian, "briſk and lively, but wholly naked and
bare of feathers, and without any winter proviſion in its hole. This cuckoo
the boys kept two years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alive in the ſtove; but whether it
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid them with a ſecond ſong, the author of the tale has not thought fit
to inform us."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt probable opinion on this ſubject is, that as quails
and wood-cocks ſhift their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in winter, ſo alſo does the
cuckoo; but to what country it retires, or whether it has been ever ſeen on
its journey, are queſtions that I am wholly incapable of reſolving.</p>
               <p>Of this bird there are many kinds in various parts of the world,
not only differing in their colours but their ſize. Briſſon makes not
leſs than twenty-eight ſorts of them; but what ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy they bear to our
Engliſh cuckoo I will not take upon me to determine. He talks of one, 
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0823900105:296"/> particularly of Braſil, as making a moſt horrible
noiſe in the foreſts; which, as it ſhould ſeem, muſt be a very
different note from that by which our bird is diſtinguiſhed at home.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Parrot and its Affinities.</head>
               <p>THE Parrot is the beſt known among us of all foreign birds, as
it unites the greateſt beauty with the greateſt docility. Its voice alſo
is more like a man's than that of any other; the raven is too hoarſe, and the
jay and magpie too ſhrill, to reſemble the truth; the parrot's note is of
the true pitch, and capable of a number of modulations that even ſome of our
orators might wiſh in vain to imitate.</p>
               <p>The eaſe with which this bird is taught to ſpeak, and the
great number of words which it is capable of repeating, are no leſs
ſurprizing. We are aſſured, by a grave writer, that one of theſe was
taught to repeat a whole ſonnet from Petrarch; and that I may not be wanting
in my inſtance, I have ſeen a parrot, belonging to a diſtiller, who had
ſuffered pretty largely in his circumſtances from an informer who lived
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite him, very ridiculouſly employed. This bird was taught to

cage over againſt the informer's houſe, and delighted the whole
neighbourhood with its perſevering exhortations.</p>
               <p>Willoughby tells a ſtory of a parrot, which is not ſo dull
as thoſe uſually brought up when this bird's facility of talking happens to
be the ſubject. 
<q rend="inline">"A parrot belonging to king Henry the Seventh,
who then reſided at Weſtminſter, in his palace by the river Thames, had
learned to talk many words from the paſſengers as they happened to take
water. One day, ſporting on its perch, the poor bird fell into the water, at
the ſame time crying out, as loud as he could, <hi>A boat, twenty pound for a
boat.</hi> A waterman, who happened to be near, hearing the cry, made to the
place where the parrot was floating, and taking him up reſtored him to the
king. As it ſeems the bird was a favourite, the man inſiſted that he
ought to have a reward rather equal to his ſervices than his trouble; and, as
the parrot had cried twenty pounds, he ſaid the king was bound in honour to
grant it. The king at laſt agreed to leave it to the parrot's own
determination, which the bird hearing, cried out, <hi>Give the knave a
groat.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>The parrot, which is ſo common as a foreign bird with us, is
equally ſo as an indignous bird in the climates where it is produced. The
fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0823900105:302"/> ſwarm with them; and the rook is not better
known with us than the parrot in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every part of the Eaſt and
Weſtern Indies. It is in vain that our naturaliſts have attempted to
arrange the various ſpecies of this bird; new varieties daily offer to puzzle
the ſyſtem-maker, or to demonſtrate the narrowneſs of his cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.
Linnaeus makes the number of its varieties amount to forty-ſeven; while
Briſſon doubles the number, and extends his catalogue to ninety-five.
Perhaps even this liſt might be encreaſed, were every accidental change of
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to be conſidered as conſtituting a new ſpecies. But, in fact,
natural hiſtory gains little by theſe diſcoveries; and as its dominions
are extended it becomes more barren. It is aſſerted, by ſenſible
travellers, that the natives of Braſil can change the colour of a parrot's
plumage by art. If this be true, and I am apt to believe the information, they
can make new ſpecies at pleaſure, and thus cut out endleſs work for our
nomenclators at home.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who uſually bring theſe birds over are content to
make three or four diſtinctions, to which they give names; and with theſe
diſtinctions I will content myſelf alſo. The large kind, which are of the
ſize of a raven, are called Maccaws; the next ſize are ſimply called
Parrots; thoſe which are entirely white are called Lories; and 
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0823900105:303"/> the leſſer ſize of all are called Parakeets. The
difference between even theſe is rather in the ſize than in any other
peculiar conformation, as they are all formed alike, having toes two before and
two behind for climbing and holding; ſtrong hooked bills for breaking open
nuts, and other hard ſubſtances, on which they feed; and loud harſh
voices, by which they fill their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive woods with clamour.</p>
               <p>But there are further peculiarities in the conformation: and
firſt, their toes are contrived in a ſingular manner, which appears when
they walk or climb, and when they are eating. For the firſt purpoſe they
ſtretch two of their toes forward and two backward; but when they take their
meat, and bring it to their mouths with their foot, they dexterouſly and
nimbly turn the greater hind toe forward, ſo as to take a firmer graſp of
the nut or the fruit they are going to feed on, ſtanding all the while upon
the other leg. Nor even do they preſent their food in the uſual manner; for
other animals turn their meat inwards to the mouth; but theſe, in a
ſeemingly aukward poſition, turn their meat outwards, and thus hold the
hardeſt nuts, as if in one hand, till with their bills they break the
ſhell, and extract the kernel.</p>
               <p>The bill is faſhioned with ſtill greater pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarites; 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0823900105:304"/> for the upper chap, as well as the lower, are both
moveable. In moſt other birds the upper chap is connected, and makes but one
piece with the ſkull; but in theſe, and in one or two ſpecies of the
feathered tribe more, the upper chap is connected to the bone of the head by a
ſtrong membrane, placed on each ſide, that lifts and depreſſes it at
pleaſure. By this contrivance they can open their bills the wider; which is
not a little uſeful, as the upper chap is ſo hooked and ſo over-hanging,
that, if the lower chap only had motion, they could ſcarce gape
ſufficiently to take any thing in for their nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Such are the uſes of the beak and the toes when uſed
ſeparately, but they are often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed both together when the bird is
exerciſed in climbing. As theſe birds cannot readily hop from bough to
bough, their legs not being adapted for that purpoſe, they uſe both the
beak and the feet; firſt catching hold with the beak, as if with a hook, then
drawing up the legs and faſtening them, then advancing the head and the beak
again, and ſo putting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the body and the feet alternately, till they
attain the height they aſpire to.</p>
               <p>The tongue of this bird ſomewhat reſembles that of a man;
for which reaſon, ſome pretend <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0823900105:305"/> that it is ſo well
qualified to imitate the human ſpeech; but the organs by which theſe
ſounds are articulated lie farther down in the throat, being performed by the
great motion which the os hyoides has in theſe birds above others.</p>
               <p>The parrot, though common enough in Europe, will not, however,
breed here. The climate is too cold for its warm conſtitution; and though it
bears our winter when arrived at maturity, yet it always ſeems ſenſible
of its rigour, and loſes both its ſpirit and appetite during the colder
part of the ſeaſon. It then becomes torpid and inactive, and ſeems quite
changed from that buſtling loquacious animal which it appeared in its native
foreſts, where it is almoſt ever upon the wing. Notwithſtanding, the
parrot lives even with us a conſiderable time, if it be properly attended to;
and, indeed, it muſt be owned, that it employs but too great a part of ſome
people's attention.</p>
               <p>The extreme ſagacity and docility of the bird may plead as the
beſt excuſe for thoſe who ſpend whole hours in teaching their parrots
to ſpeak; and, indeed, the bird, on thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſeems the
wiſeſt animal of the two. It at firſt obſtinately reſiſts all
inſtruction; but ſeems to be won by perſeverance, makes a few attempts to
imitate the firſt ſounds, and when <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0823900105:306"/> it has got one
word diſtinct, all the ſucceeding come with greater facility. The bird
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally learns moſt in thoſe families where the maſter or miſtreſs
have the leaſt to do; and becomes more expert, in proportion as its
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors are idly aſſiduous. In going through the towns of France
ſometime ſince, I could not help obſerving how much plainer their parrots
ſpoke than ours, and how very diſtinctly I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their parrots
ſpeak French, when I could not underſtand our own, though they ſpoke my
native language. I was at firſt for aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the different
qualities of the two lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and was for entering into an elaborate
diſcuſſion on the vowels and conſonants; but a friend that was with me
ſolved the difficulty at once, by aſſuring me that the French women
ſcarce did any thing elſe the whole day than ſit and inſtruct their
feathered pupils; and that the birds were thus diſtinct in their leſſons
in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of continual ſchooling.</p>
               <p>The parrots of France are certainly very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, but nothing to
thoſe of the Braſils, where the education of a parrot is conſidered as a
very ſerious affair. The Hiſtory of Prince Maurice's parrot, given us by
Mr. Locke, is too well known to be repeated here; but Cluſius aſſures us
that the parrots of that country are the moſt <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0823900105:307"/>
ſenſible and cunning of all animals not endued with reaſon. The great
parrot, called the Aicurous, the head of which is adorned with yellow, red and
violet, the body green, the ends of the wings red, the feathers of the tail
long and yellow; this bird, he aſſerts, which is ſeldom brought into
Europe, is a prodigy of underſtanding. 
<q rend="inline">"A certain Braſilian woman, that lived in a
village two miles diſtant from the iſland on which we reſided, had a
parrot of this kind which was the wonder of the place. It ſeemed endued with
ſuch underſtanding, as to diſcern and comprehend whatever ſhe ſaid to
it. As we ſometimes uſed to paſs by that woman's houſe, ſhe uſed to
call upon us to ſtop, promiſing, if we gave her a comb, or a
looking-glaſs, that ſhe would make her parrot ſing and dance to entertain
us. If we agreed to her requeſt, as ſoon as ſhe had pronounced ſome
words to the bird, it began not only to leap and ſkip on the perch on which
it ſtood, but alſo to talk and to whiſtle, and imitate the ſhoutings
and exclamations of the Braſilians when they prepare for battle. In brief,
when it came into the woman's head to bid it ſing, it ſang; to dance, it
danced. But if, contrary to our promiſe, we refuſed to give the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the
little preſent agreed on, the parrot <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0823900105:308"/> ſeemed to
ſympathize in her reſentment, and was ſilent and immoveable; neither
could we, by any means, provoke it to move either foot or tongue."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſagacity, which parrots ſhew in a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſtate,
ſeems alſo natural to them in their native reſidence among the woods.
They live together in flocks, and mutually aſſiſt each other againſt
other animals, either by their courage or their notes of warning. They
generally breed in hollow trees, where they make a round hole, and do not line
their neſt within. If they find any part of a tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to rot from the
breaking off a branch, or any ſuch accident, this they take care to ſcoop,
and to make the hole ſufficiently wide and convenient; but it ſometimes
happens that they are content with the hole which a wood-pecker has wrought out
with greater eaſe before them; and in this they prepare to hatch and bring up
their young.</p>
               <p>They lay two or three eggs; and probably the ſmaller kind may
lay more; for it is a rule that univerſally holds through nature, that the
ſmalleſt animals are always the moſt prolific; for being, from their
natural weakneſs, more ſubject to devaſtation, Nature finds it
neceſſary to repleniſh the ſpecies by ſuperior fecundity. In general,
however, the number of their eggs <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0823900105:309"/> is ſtinted to two,
like thoſe of the pigeon, and they are about the ſame ſize. They are
always marked with little ſpecks, like thoſe of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge; and ſome
travellers aſſure us, that they are always found in the trunks of the
talleſt, ſtraighteſt, and the largeſt trees. The natives of theſe
countries, who have little elſe to do, are very aſſiduous in ſpying out
the places where the parrot is ſeen to neſtle, and generally come with
great joy to inform the Europeans, if there be any, of the diſcovery. As
thoſe birds have always the greateſt docility that are taken young, ſuch
a neſt is often conſidered as worth taking ſome trouble to be
poſſeſſed of; and, for this purpoſe, the uſual method of coming at
the young is, by cutting down the tree. In the fall of the tree it often
happens that the young parrots are killed; but if one of them ſurvives the
ſhock, it is conſidered as a ſufficient recompence.</p>
               <p>Such is the avidity with which theſe birds are ſought when
young; for it is known they always ſpeak beſt when their ear has not been
anticipated by the harſh notes of the wild ones. But as the natives are not
able upon all occaſions to ſupply the demand for young ones, they are
contented to take the old; and for that purpoſe ſhoot them in the woods
with heavy arrows, headed <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0823900105:310"/> with cotton, which knocks down
the bird with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out killing it. The parrots thus ſtunned are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried home:
ſome die, but others recover, and, by kind uſage and plentiful food, become
talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and noiſy.</p>
               <p>But it is not for the ſake of their converſation alone that
the parrot is ſought after among the ſavages; for, though ſome of them
are but tough and ill-taſted, yet there are other ſorts, particularly of
the ſmall parakeet tribe, that are very delicate food. In general it obtains,
that whatever fruit or grain theſe birds moſtly feed upon, their fleſh
partakes of the flavour, and becomes good or ill taſted, according to the
quality of their particular diet. When the guava is ripe, they are at that
ſeaſon fat and tender; if they feed upon the ſeed of the acajou, their
fleſh contracts an agreeable flavour of garlick; if they feed upon the ſeed
of the ſpicy trees, their fleſh then taſtes of cloves and cinnamon;
while, on the contrary, it is inſupportably bitter if the berries they feed
on are of that quality. The ſeed of the cotton-tree intoxicates them in the
ſame manner as wine does man; and even wine itſelf is drunk by parrots, as
Ariſtotle aſſures us, by which they are thus rendered more talkative and
amuſing. But of all food, they are fondeſt of the carthamus, or baſtard 
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0823900105:311"/> ſaffron; which, though ſtrongly purgative to man,
agrees perfectly with their conſtitution, and fattens them in a very ſhort
time.</p>
               <p>Of the parakeet kind in Braſil, Labat aſſures us, that
they are the moſt beautiful in their plumage, and the moſt talkative birds
in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They are very tame, and appear fond of mankind; they ſeem
pleaſed with holding parley with him; they never have done; but while he
continues to talk, anſwer him, and appear reſolved to have the laſt word:
but they are poſſeſſed of another quality which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to put
an end to this aſſociation: their fleſh is the moſt delicate
imaginable, and highly eſteemed by thoſe who are fonder of indulging their
appetites than their ears. The fowler walks into the woods, where they keep in
abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; but as they are green, and exactly the colour of the leaves among
which they ſit, he only hears their prattle, without being able to ſee a
ſingle bird; he looks round him, ſenſible that his game is within
gun-ſhot in abundance, but is mortified to the laſt degree that it is
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſee them. Unfortunately for theſe little animals, they
are reſtleſs and ever on the wing, ſo that in flying from one tree to
another he has but too frequent opportunities of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them; for as
ſoon as they have ſtripped <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0823900105:312"/> the tree on which they
ſate of all its berries, ſome one of them flies off to another; and, if
that be found fit for the purpoſe, it gives a loud call, which all the reſt
reſort to. That is the opportunity the fowler has long been waiting for; he
fires in among the flock while they are yet on the wing; and he ſeldom fails
of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a part of them. But it is ſingular enough to ſee them
when they find their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions fallen. They ſet up a loud outcry, as if
they were chiding their deſtroyer, and do not ceaſe till they ſee him
preparing for a ſecond charge.</p>
               <p>But, though there are ſo many motives for deſtroying theſe
beautiful birds, they are in very great plenty; and in ſome countries on the
coaſt of Guinea, they are conſidered by the Negroes as their greateſt
tormentors. The flocks of parrots perſecute them with their unceaſing
ſcreaming; and devour whatever fruits they attempt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce by art in
their little gardens. In other places they are not ſo deſtructive, but
ſufficiently common; and, indeed, there is ſcarce a country of the tropical
climates that has not many of the common kinds as well as ſame peculiarly its
own. Travellers have counted more than an hundred different kinds on the
continent of Africa only; there is one country in particular, 
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0823900105:313"/> north of the Cape of Good Hope, which takes its name
from the multitude of parrots which are ſeen in its woods. There are white
parrots ſeen in the burning regions of Ethiopia; in the Eaſt-Indies, they
are of the largeſt ſize; in South-America, they are docile and talkative;
in all the iſlands of the Pacific Sea and the Indian Ocean, they ſwarm in
great variety and abundance, and add to the ſplendour of thoſe woods which
Nature has dreſſed in eternal green.</p>
               <p>So generally are theſe birds known at preſent, and ſo
great is their variety, that nothing ſeems more extraordinary than that there
was but one ſort of them known among the ancients, and that at a time when
they pretended to be maſters of the world. If nothing elſe could ſerve to
ſhew the vanity of a Roman's boaſt, the parrot-tribe might be an
inſtance, of which there are an hundred kinds now known, not one of which
naturally breeds in the countries that acknowledged the Roman power. The green
parakeet, with a red neck, was the firſt of this kind that was brought into
Europe, and the only one that was known to the ancients from the time of
Alexander the Great to the age of Nero. This was brought from India; and when
afterwards the Romans began to ſeek and <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0823900105:314"/> and rummage
through all their dominions, for new and unheard of luxuries, they at laſt
found out others in Gaganda, an iſland of Ethiopia, which they conſidered
as an extraordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
               <p>Parrots have uſually the ſame diſorders with other birds;
and they have one or two peculiar to their kind. They are ſometimes ſtruck
by a kind of apoplectic blow, by which they fall from their perches, and for a
while ſeem ready to expire. The other is the growing of the beak, which
becomes ſo very much hooked as to deprive them of the power of eating.
Theſe infirmities, however, do not hinder them from being long-lived; for a
parrot well kept will live five or ſix and twenty years.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The Pigeon and its Varieties.</head>
               <p>THIS is one of the birds which, from its great fecundity, we
have, in ſome meaſure, reclaimed from a ſtate of nature, and taught to
live in habits of dependance. Indeed, its fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity ſeems to be encreaſed
by human culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſince thoſe pigeons that live in a wild ſtate, in
the woods, are by no means ſo fruitful as thoſe in our pigeon-houſes
nearer home. The power of encreaſe in moſt birds depends upon the quantity
of their food; and it is ſeen, in more than one inſtance, that man, by
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying food in plenty, and allowing the animal at the ſame time a
proper ſhare of freedom, has brought ſome of thoſe kinds which are known
to lay but once a year, to become much more prolific.</p>
               <p>The tame pigeon, and all its beautiful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, derive their
origin from one ſpecies, the Stock Dove only, the Engliſh name, implying
its being the ſtock or ſtem from whence the other domeſtic kinds have
been propagated. This bird, in its natural ſtate, is of a deep blueiſh
aſh colour; the breaſt daſhed with a fine change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able 
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0823900105:316"/> green and purple; its wings marked with two black bars;
the back white, and the tail barred near the end with black. Theſe are the
colours of the pigeon in a ſtate of nature; and from theſe ſimple tints
has man by art propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated a variety that words cannot deſcribe, nor even
fancy ſuggeſt. However, Nature ſtill perſeveres in her great out-line;
and though the form, colour, and even the fecundity of theſe birds may be
altered by art, yet their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural manners and inclinations continue ſtill
the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſtock-dove, in its native woods, differs from the
ring-dove, a bird that has never been reclaimed, by its breeding in the holes
of rocks and the hollows of trees. All other birds of the pigeon-kind build
like rooks, in the topmoſt branches of the foreſt, and chuſe their
habitation as remote as poſſible from man. But this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſoon takes
to build in artificial cavities; and, from the temptation of a ready
proviſion and numerous ſociety, eaſily ſubmits to the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of man.
Still, however, it preſerves its native colour for ſeveral generations, and
becomes more variegated only in proportion as it removes from the original
ſimplicity of its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring in the woods.</p>
               <p>The dove-houſe pigeon, as is well known, <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0823900105:317"/> breeds every month; but then it is neceſſary to ſupply it with
food when the weather is ſevere, or the fields are covered with ſnow. Upon
other occaſions, it may be left to provide for itſelf; and it generally
repays the owner for his protection. The pigeon lays two white eggs, which
moſt uſually produce young ones of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſexes. For the laying of
each egg, it is neceſſary to have a particular congreſs with the male;
and the egg is uſually depoſited in the afternoon. When the eggs are thus
laid, the female in the ſpace of fifteen days, not including the three days
during which ſhe is employed in laying, continues to hatch, relieved at
intervals by the male. The turns are uſually regulated with great
exactneſs. From three or four o'clock in the evening till nine the next day,
the female continues to ſit; ſhe is then relieved by the male, who takes
his place from ten till three, while his mate is feeding abroad. In this manner
they ſit alternately till the young are excluded. If, during this term, the
female de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays to return at the expected time, the male follows, and drives her
to the neſt; and, ſhould he in his turn be dilatory, ſhe retaliates with
equal ſeverity.</p>
               <p>The young ones when hatched require no food for the three
firſt days, only wanting to <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0823900105:318"/> be kept warm, which is an
employment the female takes entirely upon herſelf. During this period, ſhe
never ſtirs out, except for a few minutes to take a little food. From this
they are fed for eight or ten days, with corn or grain of different kinds,
which the old ones gather in the fields, and keep treaſured up in their
crops, from whence they throw it up again into the mouths of their young ones
who very greedily demand it.</p>
               <p>As this method of feeding the young from the crop is different
in birds of the pigeon-kind from all others, it demands a more detailed
explanation. Of all birds, for its ſize, the pigeon has the largeſt crop,
which is alſo made in a manner quite peculiar to the kind. In two of theſe
that were diſſected by a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, it was
found that if the anatomiſt blew air into the wind-pipe, it diſtended the
crop or gullet to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious ſize. This was the more extraordinary as
there ſeemed to be no communication what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever between theſe two
receptacles, as the conduit by which we breathe, as every one knows, leads to a
very different receptacle from that where we put our food. By what apertures
the air blown into the lungs of the pigeon makes its way into the crop, is
unknown; but <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0823900105:319"/> nothing is more certain than that theſe
birds have a power of filling the crop with air; and ſome of them, which are
called croppers, diſtend it in ſuch a manner, that the bird's breaſt
ſeems bigger than its body. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar mechaniſm of this part is not
well known; but the neceſſity for it in theſe animals is pretty obvious.
The pigeon, as we all know, lives entirely upon grain and water: theſe are
mixed together in the crop; and in the ordinary way are digeſted in
proportion as the bird lays in its proviſion. But to feed its young, which
are very voracious, it is neceſſary to lay in a ſtore greater than
ordinary, and to give the food a kind of half maceration to ſuit their tender
appetites. The heat of the bird's body, aſſiſted by air and numerous
glands ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating a milky fluid, are the moſt neceſſary inſtruments
for this operation; but, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the food macerates it begins to
ſwell alſo; and the crop muſt of conſequence be conſiderably dilated.
Still, however, the air which is contained in it gives the bird a power of
contracting it at pleaſure; for if it were filled with more ſolid
ſubſtances, the bird could have no power to compreſs it. But this is not
the caſe, the bird can compreſs its crop at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and driving out
the air, can thus drive <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0823900105:320"/> out the food alſo, which is
forced up the gullet like a pellet from a pop-gun. The young ones open-mouthed
receive this tribute of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are thus fed three times a day. In
feeding, the male uſually ſupplies the young female; while the old female
ſupplies the young of the oppoſite ſex. The food with which they are
ſupplied is more macerated in the beginning; but as they grow older, the
parents give it leſs preparation, and at laſt drive them out to ſhift for
themſelves. When well fed, however, the old ones do not wait for the total
diſmiſſion of their young; but, in the ſame neſt, are to be found
young ones almoſt fit for flight, and eggs hatching, at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>The fidelity of the turtle-dove is proverbial, and makes the
uſual compariſon of ſuch poets as are content to repeat what others have
ſaid before them; but the pigeon of the dove-houſe is not ſo faithful;
and, having been ſubjected to man, it puts on licentiouſneſs among its
other domeſtic habits. Two males are often ſeen quarreling for the ſame
miſtreſs; and when the female admits the addreſſes of a new gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
her old companion ſeems to bear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with ſome marks of
diſpleaſure, abſtains from her company, or if he approaches, it is only
to chaſtiſe her. There have been inſtances when two males, being
diſpleaſed with their <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0823900105:321"/> reſpective mates, have
thought proper to make an exchange, and have lived in great harmony with their
new companions.</p>
               <p>So great is the produce of this bird in its domeſtic ſtate,
that near fifteen thouſand may in the ſpace of four years be produced from
a ſingle pair. But the ſtock-dove ſeldom breeds above twice a year; for,
when the winter months come, the whole employment of the fond cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is rather
for ſelf-preſervation, than tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a poſterity. They ſeem,
however, to have a ſtronger attachment to their young than thoſe who are
found to breed ſo often; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that inſtinct acts more powerfully
upon them in their ſtate of nature, or that their affections are leſs
divided by the multiplicity of claims.</p>
               <p>It is from a ſpecies of theſe, therefore, that thoſe
pigeons which are called Carriers, and are uſed to convey letters, are
produced. Theſe are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from all others by their eyes,
which are compaſſed about with a broad circle of naked white ſkin, and by
being of a dark blue or blackiſh colour. It is from their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to
their native place, and particularly where they have brought up their young,
that theſe birds are employed in ſeveral countries as the moſt
expeditious carriers. They are firſt <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0823900105:322"/> brought from the
place where they were bred, and whither it is intended to ſend them back with
information. The letter is tied under the bird's wing, and it is then let
looſe to return. The little animal no ſooner finds itſelf at liberty,
than its paſſion for its native ſpot directs all its motions. It is
ſeen, upon theſe occaſions, flying directly into the clouds to an amazing
height; and then, with the greateſt certainty and exactneſs, directing
itſelf by ſome ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtinct towards home, which lies
ſometimes at many miles diſtance, bringing its meſſage to thoſe to
whom it is directed. By what marks they diſcover the place, by what chart
they are guided in the right way, is to us utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; certain it is,
that in the ſpace of an hour and an half they perform a journey of forty
miles; which is a degree of diſpatch three times greater than the fleeteſt
quadrupede can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Theſe birds are not brought up at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with as
much care as formerly, when they were ſent from governors in a beſieged
city to generals that were coming to relieve it without; when they were ſent
from princes to their ſubjects with the tidings of ſome fortunate event, or
from lovers to their miſtreſſes with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their
paſſion. The only uſe we now ſee made of them, is to be let fly at
Tyburn, when the cart is drawn away; pretty much as <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0823900105:323"/> when
ſome antient heroe was to be interred, an eagle was let off from the funeral
pile, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete his apotheoſis.</p>
               <p>The varieties of the tame pigeon are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, that it
would be a vain attempt to mention them: ſo much is the figure and the colour
of this bird under human controul, that pigeon-fanciers, by coupling a male and
fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male of different ſorts, can breed them, as they expreſs it, to a
feather. From hence we have the various names of Croppers, Carriers,
Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobines, Powters, Runts, and Turbits: all birds that at firſt might have
accidentally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the ſtock-dove; and then, by having theſe
varieties ſtill heightened by food, cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and paring, different ſpecies
have been produced. But there are many ſpecies of the wild pigeon which,
though bearing a ſtrong affinity to the ſtock-dove, are, nevertheleſs,
ſufficiently different from it to deſerve a diſtinct deſcription. The
Ring-dove is of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; a good deal larger than the former, and building
its neſt, with a few dry ſticks, in the boughs of trees. This ſeems a
bird much fonder of its native freedom than the former; and attempts have been
frequently made to render it domeſtic: but they have hitherto proved
fruitleſs; for, though their eggs have <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0823900105:324"/> been hatched by
the tame pigeon in a dove-houſe, yet, as ſoon as they could fly, they
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways betook themſelves to the woods where they were firſt produced. In
the beginning of winter, theſe aſſemble in great flocks in the woods, and
leave off cooing; nor do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this note of courtſhip till the
beginning of March, when the genial ſeaſon, by ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with food,
renews their deſires.</p>
               <p>The turtle-dove is a ſmaller, but a much ſhyer, bird than
any of the former. It may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by the
iris of the eye, which is of a fine yellow, and by a beautiful crimſon circle
that encompaſſes the eye-lids. The fidelity of theſe birds is noted; and
a pair being put in a cage, if one dies, the other will not ſurvive it. The
turtle-dove is a bird of paſſage, and few or none remain in our northern
climates in winter. They fly in flocks when they come to breed here in
ſummer, and delight in open, mountainous, ſandy countries. But they build
their neſts in the midſt of woods, and chuſe the moſt retired
ſituations for incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. They feed upon all ſorts of grain, but are
fondeſt of millet-ſeed.</p>
               <p>To this ſhort liſt might be added a long ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of
foreign pigeons, of which we know little more than the plumage and the names: 
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0823900105:325"/> indeed, the variety of their plumage is as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful as
the names by which they are known are harſh and diſſonant. The
Ocotzimtzcan, for inſtance, is one of the moſt ſplendid tenants of the
Mexican foreſts; but few, I believe, would deſire to learn the name, only
to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that it is covered with purple, green, and yellow plumage. To
deſcribe ſuch birds, the hiſtorian's pen is not half ſuch an uſeful
implement as the painter's pencil.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Birds of the Sparrow Kind in General.</head>
               <p>STILL deſcending from the larger to the ſmaller, we come to
birds of the ſparrow kind; or that claſs of beautiful little animals that,
being leſs than the pigeon, go on diminiſhing till we arrive at the
humming-bird, the ſmalleſt of the feathered creation.</p>
               <p>The birds which compoſe this claſs, chiefly live in the
neighbourhood of man, and are his greateſt favourites. The falcon may be more
eſteemed, and the turkey more uſeful; but theſe he conſiders as
ſervants, not as friends; as animals reclaimed merely to ſupply him with
ſome of the conveniences of life: but theſe little painted ſongſters
have his affections, as well from their beauty as their melody; it is this
delightful claſs that fill his groves with harmony, and lift his heart to
ſympathize with their rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. All the other claſſes are either mute or
ſcreaming; it is this diminutive tribe only that have voices equal to the
beauty of their figures; equally adapted to rejoice man, and delight each
other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0823900105:328"/>As they are the favourites of man, ſo
they are chiefly ſeen near him. All the great birds dread his vicinity, and
keep to the thickeſt darkneſs of the foreſt, or the brow of the moſt
craggy precipice: but theſe ſeldom reſort to the thicker parts of the
wood; they keep near its edges, in the neighbourhood of cultivated fields; in
the hedge-rows of farm-grounds; and even in the yard, mixing with the
poultry.</p>
               <p>It muſt be owned, indeed, that their living near man is not a
ſociety of affection on their part, as they approach inhabited grounds merely
becauſe their chief proviſion is to be found there. In the depth of the
deſart, or the gloom of the foreſt, there is no grain to be picked up; none
of theſe tender buds that are ſo grateful to their appetites; inſects,
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that make ſo great a part of their food, are not found there
in abundance; their natures being unſuited to the moiſture of the place. As
we enter, therefore, deeper into uncultivated woods, the ſilence becomes more
profound; every thing carries the look of awful ſtillneſs; there are none
of thoſe warblings, none of thoſe murmurs that awaken attention, as near
the habitations of men; there is nothing of that confuſed buzz, formed by the
united though <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0823900105:329"/> diſtant voices of quadrupedes and birds;
but all is profoundly dead and ſolemn. Now and then, indeed, the traveller
may be rouzed from this lethargy of life, by the voice of an heron, or the
ſcream of an eagle; but his ſweet little friends and warblers have totally
forſaken him.</p>
               <p>There is ſtill another reaſon for theſe little birds
avoiding the depths of the foreſt; which is, that their moſt formidable
enemies uſually reſide there. The greater birds, like robbers, chuſe the
moſt dreary ſolitudes for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats; and, if they do not find they
make a deſart all around them. The ſmall-birds fly from their tyranny, and
take protection in the vicinity of man, where they know their more unmerciful
foes will not venture to purſue them.</p>
               <p>All birds, even thoſe of paſſage, ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a
certain diſtrict to provide food and center in. The red-breaſt or the wren
ſeldom leaves the field where it has been brought up, or where its young have
been excluded; even though hunted it flies along the hedge, and ſeems fond of
the place with an imprudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance. The fact is, all theſe ſmall
birds mark out a territory to themſelves, which they will permit none of
their own ſpecies to remain in; they guard their dominions with the moſt 
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0823900105:330"/> watchful reſentment; and we ſeldom find two male
tenants in the ſame hedge together.</p>
               <p>Thus, though fitted by nature for the moſt wandering life,
theſe little animals do not make ſuch diſtant excurſions, during the
ſeaſon of their ſtay, as the ſtag or the leveret. Food ſeems to be
the only object that puts them in motion, and when that is provided for them in
ſufficient plenty they never wander. But as that is ſeldom permanent
through the year, almoſt every bird is then obliged to change its abode. Some
are called birds of paſſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are obliged to take long
journeys for this purpoſe; but, ſtrictly ſpeaking, almoſt every other
kind are birds of paſſage, though their migration may not be to places ſo
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. At ſome particular ſeaſon of the year, all ſmall birds migrate
either from one county to another, or from the more inland provinces towards
the ſhore.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral perſons who get a livelihood by watching
the ſeaſons when our ſmall birds begin to migrate from one county to
another, and by taking them with nets in their paſſage. The birds are found
to fly, as the bird-catchers term it, chiefly during the month of October, and
part of September and November. There is alſo another flight in March, which
is much leſs conſiderable than that in autumn. <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0823900105:331"/> Nor
is it leſs remarkable, that ſeveral of theſe ſpecies of flight-birds
make their appearance in regular ſucceſſion. The pippit, for inſtance,
begins its flight every year about Michaelmas, when they are caught in
greateſt number. To this the wood-lark ſucceeds, and continues its flight
till towards the middle of October; other birds follow, but are not ſo
punctually perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical; the green-finch does not begin till the froſt obliges
it to ſeek for a change. Theſe birds, during thoſe months, fly from
day-break till twelve at noon; and there is afterwards a ſmall flight from
two till night. Such are the ſeaſons of the migration of the birds, which
have been uſually conſidered as ſtationary, and on theſe occaſions
they are caught in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as they are on their journey. But the
ſame arts uſed to allure them upon other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions would be utterly
fruitleſs, as they avoid the nets with the moſt prudent circumſpection.
The autumnal flight probably conſiſts of the parents conducting their
new-fledged young to thoſe places where there is ſufficient proviſion,
and a proper temperament of the air during the winter ſeaſon; and their
return in ſpring is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly from an attachment to the place which was
found ſo convenient before for the purpoſes of neſtling and
incubation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0823900105:332"/>Autumn is the principal ſeaſon when
the bird-catcher employs his art to catch theſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers. His nets are a
moſt ingenious piece of mechaniſm, being generally twelve yards and a half
long, and two yards and a half wide, and ſo contrived as from a flat
poſition to riſe on each ſide, and clap over the birds that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyed
to come between them. The birds in their paſſage are always obſerved to
fly againſt the wind; hence there is a great contention among the
bird-catchers which ſhall gain the wind; for example, if it is weſterly,
the bird-catcher who lays his nets moſt to the eaſt, is ſure of the
moſt plentiful ſport if his call-birds are good. For this purpoſe, he
generally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries five or ſix linnets, two gold-finches, two green-finches,
one wood-lark, one red-poll, and perhaps a bull-finch, a yellow-hammer, a
tit-lark, and an aberdavine: theſe are placed at ſmall diſtances from the
nets in little cages. He has beſides what he calls his flur-birds, which are
placed upon a moveable perch, which the bird-catcher can raiſe at pleaſure
by means of a ſtring; and theſe he always lifts gently up and down as the
wild bird approaches. But this is not enough to allure the wild bird down; it
muſt be called by one of the call-birds in the cages; and theſe, by being
made to moult pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0823900105:333"/> in a warm cage, call louder
and better than thoſe that are wild and at freedom. There even appears a
malicious joy in theſe call-birds to bring the wild ones into the ſame
ſtate of captivity, while at the ſame time their call is louder and their
plumage brighter than in a ſtate of nature. Nor is their ſight or hearing
leſs exquiſite, far exceeding that of the bird-catcher; for the inſtant
the wild birds are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, notice is given by one to the reſt of the
call-birds, who all unite in the ſame tumultuous ecſtacy of pleaſure. The
call-birds do not ſing upon theſe occaſions as a bird does in a chamber,
but incite the wild ones by ſhort jerks, which, when the birds are good, may
be heard at a great diſtance. The allurement of this call is ſo great, that
the wild bird hearing it is ſtopped in its moſt rapid flight; and, if not
already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nets, lights boldly within twenty yards perhaps of
the bird-catcher, and on a ſpot which it would otherwiſe have quite
diſregarded. This is the opportunity wiſhed for, and the bird-catcher
pulling a ſtring, the nets on each ſide riſe in an inſtant, and clap
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly down on the poor little unſuſpecting vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitant. Nay, it
frequently happens that if half a flock only are caught, the remaining half
will immediately afterwards light between the nets, <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0823900105:334"/> and
ſhare the fate of their companions. Should only one bird eſcape, this
unhappy ſurvivor will alſo venture into danger till it is caught; ſuch a
faſcinating power have the call-birds.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it is not eaſy to account for the nature of this call,
whether it be a challenge to combat, an invitation to food, or a prelude to
courtſhip. As the call-birds are all males, and as the wild birds that attend
to their voice are moſt frequently males alſo, it does not ſeem that love
can have any influence in their aſſiduity. Perhaps the wild females, in
theſe flights, attend to and obey the call below, and their male companions
of the flight come down to bear them company. If this be the caſe, and that
the females have unfaithfully led their mates into the nets, they are the
firſt that are puniſhed for their infidelity; the males are only made
captives for ſinging; while the females are indiſcriminately killed, and
ſold to be ſerved up to the tables of the delicate.</p>
               <p>Whatever be the motives that thus arreſt a flock of birds in
their flight, whether they be of gallantry or of war, it is certain that the
ſmall birds are equally remarkable for both. It is, perhaps, the genial
deſire that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires the courage of moſt animals; and that being
greateſt in the males, gives them a <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0823900105:335"/> greater degree of
valour than the females. Small birds, being extremely amorous, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
brave. However contemptible theſe little warriors are to larger creatures,
they are often but too formidable to each other; and ſometimes fight till one
of them yields up his life with the vlctory. But their contentions are
ſometimes of a gentler nature. Two male birds ſhall ſtrive in ſong
till, after a long ſtruggle, the loudeſt ſhall entirely ſilence the
other. During theſe contentions, the female ſits an attentive ſilent
auditor, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the loudeſt ſongſter with her company during
the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Singing among birds is almoſt univerſally the prerogative of
the male. With them it is the reverſe of what occurs in the human kind. Among
the feathered tribe, the heavieſt cares of life fall to the lot of the
female. Hers is the fatigue of incubation, and to her devolves the principal
fatigue of nurſing the helpleſs brood. To alleviate theſe fatigues, and
to ſupport her under them, Nature has given the ſong to the male. This
ſerves as a note of blandiſhment at firſt to attract her affections; it
ſerves as a note to delight her during the time of her incubation; but it
ſerves ſtill farther as a note of ſecurity, to aſſure her that no
danger threatens <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0823900105:336"/> to moleſt her. The male, while his
mate is hatching, ſits upon ſome neighbouring tree, continuing at once to
watch and to ſing. While his voice is heard, the female reſts in confident
ſecurity; and, as the poet expreſſes it, appears 
<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>moſt bleſſed when moſt
unſeen:</hi>
                  </q> But if any appearance of danger offers to intrude, the male,
that a moment before was ſo loud and ſportive, ſtops all of a ſudden;
and this is a moſt certain ſignal to his mate to provide for her own
ſecurity.</p>
               <p>The neſt of little birds ſeems to be of a more delicate
contrivance than that of the larger kinds. As the volume of their bodies is
ſmaller, the materials of which their neſts are compoſed are generally
warmer. It is eaſy to conceive that ſmall things keep heat a ſhorter time
than thoſe that are large. The eggs, therefore, of ſmall birds require a
place of more conſtant warmth than thoſe of great ones, as being liable to
cool more quickly; and accordingly their neſts are built warmer and deeper,
lined on the inſide with ſofter ſubſtances, and guarded above with a
better covering. But it ſometimes happens that the little archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects are
diſturbed in their operations, and then they are obliged to make a neſt;
not ſuch as they wiſh, but ſuch as they can. The bird, 
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0823900105:337"/> whoſe neſt has been robbed ſeveral times, builds
up her laſt in a very ſlovenly manner, conſcious that, from the near
approach of winter, ſhe muſt not take time to give her habitation every
poſſible advantage it is capable of receiving. When the neſt is
finiſhed, nothing can exceed the cunning which the male and female em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to
conceal it. If it is built in buſhes, the pliant branches are ſo
diſpoſed as to hide it entirely from the view; if it be built among moſs,
nothing outwardly appears to ſhew that there is an habitation within. It is
always built near thoſe places where food is found in greateſt abundance;
and they take care never to go in or out while there is any one in ſight. The
greater birds continue from their neſt for ſome time, as their eggs take no
damage in their abſence; but the little birds are aſſiduous while they
ſit, and the neſt is always occupied by the male when the female is obliged
to ſeek for ſuſtenance.</p>
               <p>The firſt food of all birds of the ſparrow kind is worms and
inſects. Even the ſparrow and the gold-finch, that when adult feed only
upon grain, have both been fed upon inſects while in the neſt. The young
ones, for ſome time after their excluſion from the ſhell, require no
food; but the parent ſoon finds by their chirping <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0823900105:338"/> and
gaping that they begin to feel the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of hunger, and flies to provide
them a plentiful ſupply. In her abſence, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to lie cloſe
together, and cheriſh each other by their mutual warmth. During this interval
alſo, they preſerve a perfect ſilence, uttering not the ſlighteſt
note till the parent returns. Her arrival is always announced by a chirrup,
which they perfectly underſtand, and which they anſwer all together, each
petitioning for its portion. The parent diſtributes a ſupply to each by
turns, cautiouſly avoiding to gorge them, but to give them often though
little at a time. The wren will in this manner feed ſeventeen or eighteen
young ones, without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over one of them.</p>
               <p>Such is the manner in which theſe birds bring forth and hatch
their young; but it yet remains to uſher them from the neſt into life, and
this they very aſſiduouſly perform. When they are fully fledged, and
fitted for ſhort flights, the old ones, if the weather be fair, lead them a
few yards from the neſt, and then compel them to return. For two or three
ſucceeding days they are led out in the ſame manner, but each day to ſeek
more diſtant adventures. When it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they can fly, and ſhift
for themſelves, then the parents forſake them for ever, and 
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0823900105:339"/> pay them no more attention than they do to other birds
in the ſame flock. Indeed, it would ſeem among theſe little animals that,
from the moment their young are ſet out, all future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion ceaſes
between the male and female; they go ſeparate ways, each to provide for
itſelf, during the rigours of winter; and, at the approach of ſpring, each
ſeeks for a new aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate.</p>
               <p>In general, birds, when they come to pair in ſpring,
aſſociate with thoſe of their own age and place of abode. Their
ſtrength or courage is generally in proportion to their age; the oldeſt
females firſt feel the acceſſes of deſire, and the oldeſt males are
the boldeſt to drive off all younger pretenders. Thoſe next in courage and
deſire, become pretenders, till they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all provided in turn. The
youngeſt come laſt; as, in fact, they are the lateſt in their
inclinations. But ſtill there are ſeveral, both males and females, that
remain unprovided for; either not happening to meet with each other, or at
leaſt not during the genial interval. Whether theſe mix with ſmall birds
of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies, is a doubt which naturaliſts have not been able
thoroughly to reſolve. Addiſon, in ſome beautiful Latin lines, inſerted
in the Spectator, is entirely of opinion that birds <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0823900105:340"/>
obſerve a ſtrict chaſtity of manners, and never admit the careſſes of
a different tribe.</p>
               <q> 
                  <l>Chaſte are their inſtincts, faithful is their fire,</l> 
                  <l>No foreign beauty tempts to falſe deſire:</l> 
                  <l>The ſnow-white veſture, and the glittering crown,</l> 
                  <l>The ſimple plumage, or the gloſſy down,</l> 
                  <l>Prompt not their love. The patriot bird purſues</l> 
                  <l>His well acquainted tints, and kindred hues.</l> 
                  <l>Hence through their tribes no mix'd polluted flame,</l> 
                  <l>No monſter breed to mark the groves with ſhame:</l> 
                  <l>But the chaſte blackbird, to its partner true,</l> 
                  <l>Thinks black alone is beauty's favourite hue:</l> 
                  <l>The nightingale, with mutual paſſion bleſt,</l> 
                  <l>Sings to its mate, and nightly charms the neſt:</l> 
                  <l>While the dark owl, to court his partner flies,</l> 
                  <l>And owns his offspring in their yellow eyes.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But whatever may be the poet's opinion, the probability is
againſt this fidelity among the ſmaller tenants of the grove. The great
birds are much more true to their ſpecies than theſe; and, of
conſequence, the varieties among them are more few. Of the oſtrich, the
caſſowary, and the eagle, there are but few ſpecies; and no arts that man
can uſe, could probably induce them to mix with each other.</p>
               <p>But it is otherwiſe with the ſmall birds we are
deſcribing; it requires very little trouble to make a ſpecies between a
goldfinch and <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0823900105:341"/> a canary-bird, between a linnet and a
lark. They breed frequently together; and produce a race not, like the mules
among quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes, incapable of breeding again; for this motley mixture are as
fruitful as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. What is ſo eaſily done by art, very probably
often happens in a ſtate of nature; and when the male cannot find a mate of
his own ſpecies, he flies to one of another, that, like him, has been left
out in pairing. This ſome hiſtorians think may have given riſe to the
great variety of ſmall birds that are ſeen among us; ſome uncommon
mixture might firſt have formed a new ſpecies, and this might have been
continued down, by birds of this ſpecies chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to breed together.</p>
               <p>Whether the great variety of our ſmall birds may have ariſen
from this ſource, cannot now be aſcertained; but certain it is, that they
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble each other very ſtrongly, not only in their form and plumage, but
alſo in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and manner of living. The goldfinch, the linnet, and
the yellow-hammer, though obviouſly of different ſpecies, yet lead a very
ſimilar life; being equally an active, lively, ſalacious tribe, that
ſubſiſt by petty thefts upon the labours of mankind, and repay them with
a ſong. Their neſts bear a ſimilitude; and <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0823900105:342"/>

all about the ſame time in hatching their young, which is uſually fifteen
days. Were I therefore to deſcribe the manners of theſe with the ſame
minuteneſs that I have done the greater birds, I ſhould only preſent the
reader with a repetition of the ſame accounts; animated neither by novelty
nor information. Inſtead, therefore, of ſpecifying each ſort, I will
throw them into groupes; uniting thoſe together that practiſe the ſame
manners, or that are remarkable for ſimilar qualifications.</p>
               <p>Willaughby has divided all the ſmaller birds into thoſe that
have ſlender bills, and thoſe that have ſhort and thick bills. Thoſe
with ſlender bills, chiefly live upon inſects; thoſe with ſhort,
ſtrong bills, live moſtly upon fruits and grain. Among ſlender billed
birds, he enumerates the thruſh, the blackbird, the fieldfare, the
ſtarling, the lark, the titmouſe, the water-wagtail, the nightingale, the
red-ſtart, the robin red-breaſt, the beccafigo, the ſtone-chatter, the
whinchat, the goldfinch, the white-throat, the hedge-ſparrow, the pettichaps,
the golden crowned wren, the wren, the humming-bird, and ſeveral other
ſmall birds of the ſparrow kind, unknown in this part of the world.</p>
               <p>All theſe, as was ſaid, live for the moſt part 
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0823900105:345"/> upon inſects; and are conſequently of particular
benefit to man. By theſe are his grounds cleared of the pernicious ſwarms
of vermin that devour the budding leaves and flowers; and that even attack the
root itſelf, before ever the vegetable can come to maturity. Theſe ſeek
for and deſtroy the eggs of inſects that would otherwiſe propagate in
numbers beyond the arts of man to extirpate: they know better than man where to
ſeek for them; and thus at once ſatisfy their own appetites, and render him
the moſt eſſential ſervices.</p>
               <p>But this is not the only merit of this tribe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in it we have the ſweeteſt
ſongſters of the grove; their notes are ſofter, and their manner more
muſically ſoothing than thoſe of hard billed birds. The foremoſt in
muſical fame are, the nightingale, the thruſh, the blackbird, the lark, the
red-breaſt, the black-cap, and the wren.</p>
               <p>Birds of the ſparrow kind, with thick and ſhort bills, are
the groſsbeak, the greenfinch, the bullfinch, the croſsbill, the
houſe-ſparrow, the chaffinch, the brambling, the goldfinch, the linnet, the
ſiſkin, the bunting, the yellow-hammer, the ortolan, the wheat-ear, and
ſeveral other foreign birds, of which we know rathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the names than the hiſtory. Theſe chiefly feed upon
fruits, grain, and corn. They are often <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0823900105:346"/> troubleſome to
man, as they are a numerous tribe: the harveſt often ſuffers from their
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations; and while they are driven off from one end of the field, they
fly round, and come in at the other. But theſe alſo have their uſes: they
are frequently the diſtributors of ſeeds into different diſtricts:
thoſe grains which they ſwallow, are ſometimes, not wholly digeſted;
and theſe, laid upon a ſoil congenial to them, embelliſh the face of
nature with that agreeable variety which art but vainly attempts to imitate.
The miſletoe plant, which we often ſee growing on the tops of elm and other
trees, has been thought to be propagated in this manner; yet, as it is often
ſeen growing on the under ſide of the branch, and ſometimes on a
perpendicular ſhoot, it ſeems extraordinary how a ſeed could be
depoſited in that ſituation. However this be, there are many plants
propagated from the depoſitions of birds; and ſome ſeeds are thought to
thrive the better, for firſt having undergone a kind of maceration in the
ſtomach of the little animal, before it is voided on the ground.</p>
               <p>There are ſome agreeable ſongſters in this tribe alſo;
and thoſe who like a loud piercing pipe, endued with great variety and
perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, will be pleaſed moſt with their ſinging. The
ſongſters of this claſs are the canary-bird, <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0823900105:347"/> the
linnet, the chaffinch, the goldfinch, the greenfinch, the bullfinch, the
brambling, the ſiſkin, and the yellow-hammer. The note of theſe is not
ſo generally pleaſing as that of the ſoft billed bird, but it uſually
holds longer; and, in a cage, theſe birds are more eaſily fed, and
hardy.</p>
               <p>This claſs of ſmall birds, like all the greater, has its
wanderers, that leave us for a ſeaſon, and then return, to propagate, to
ſing, or to embelliſh the landſcape here. Some of this ſmaller kind,
indeed, are called birds of paſſage, that do not properly come under the
denomination; for though they diſappear in one place, they never leave the
kingdom, but are ſeen ſomewhere elſe. But there are many among them, that
take longer flights, and go to a region colder or warmer, as it ſuits their
conſtitutions. The field-fare and the red-wing breed, paſs their ſummers
in Norway, and other cold countries, and are tempted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our mild
winters, and to thoſe various berries which then abound with us, and make
their principal food. The hawfinch and the croſsbill are uncertain
viſitants, and have no ſtated times of migration. Swallows of every
ſpecies diſappear at the approach of winter. The nightingale, the
black-cap, the fly-catcher, <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0823900105:348"/> the willow-wren, the
wheat-ear, the whin-chat, and the ſtone-chatter, leave us long before the
approach of winter; while the ſiſkin and the linnet only forſake us when
our winters are more than uſually ſevere. All the reſt of the ſmaller
tribe never quit this country; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſevereſt rigours of the
climate.</p>
               <p>Yet it muſt not be ſuppoſed that the manners of our little
birds prevail in all other countries; and that ſuch kinds as are ſtationary
with us, never wander in other parts of Europe: on the contrary, it happens
that many of thoſe kinds which are birds of paſſage in England, are
ſeen, in other places, never to depart, but to make one country their fixed
reſidence, the whole year round. It is alſo frequent, that ſome birds,
which with us are faithful reſidents, in other kingdoms put on the nature of
birds of paſſage, and diſappear for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The ſwallow, that with us is particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked for being
a bird of paſſage, in Upper Egypt, and in the iſland of Java, breeds and
continues the whole year, without ever diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. Larks, that remain with
us the year throughout, are birds of paſſage in Sweden; and forſake that
climate in winter, to return again with the returning ſpring. The chaffinch,
that with us is ſtationary, appears during the <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0823900105:349"/> winter
in Carolina and Virginia; but diſappears totally in ſummer, to breed in the
more north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern regions. In Sweden alſo, theſe little birds are ſeen
returning, at the approach of ſpring, from the warmer climates, to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate; which being accompliſhed by the latter end of autumn, the males
and females ſeparate; the males to continue among their native ſnows, the
females to ſeek a warmer and gentler winter. On this occaſion, they are
ſeen in flocks, that darken all the air, without a ſingle male among them,
making their way into the more ſouthern regions of Denmark, Germany, and
Holland. In this amazon-like retreat, thouſands fall by the way; ſome by
fatigue, ſome by want; but the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by the nets of the fowler;
the taking them being one of the chief amuſements among the gentry where they
paſs. In ſhort, the change of country with all this little tribe, is rather
a pilgrimage than a journey; a migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rather of neceſſity than of
choice.</p>
               <p>Having thus given a general idea of the birds of this claſs,
it will be proper to give ſome account of the moſt remarkable among
them.</p>

kind by its ſuperior ſize, being much larger than any of them. It differs
ſcarcely in any other reſpect from the throſtle, except that the ſpots
on the breaſt are larger. It builds its neſt in buſhes, or on the ſide
of ſome tree, as all of this kind are found to do, and lays four or five eggs
in a ſeaſon. Its ſong is very fine, which it begins in ſpring,
ſitting on the ſummit of a high tree. It is the largeſt bird of all the 
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0823900105:351"/> feathered tribe that has muſic in its voice; the note
of all greater birds being either ſcreaming, chattering, or croaking. It
feeds on inſects, holly, and miſletoe-berries; and ſometimes ſends
forth a very diſagreeable ſcream when frighted or diſturbed.</p>
               <p>The black-bird, which in cold countries, and particularly upon
the Alps, is ſometimes ſeen all over white, is a beautiful and a canorous
bird, whiſtling all the ſpring and ſummer-time with a note at a
diſtance the moſt pleaſing of all the grove. It is the deepeſt toned
warbler of the woods; but it is rather unpleaſant in a cage, being loud and
deafening. It lays four or five bluiſh eggs, in a neſt uſually built at
the ſtump of ſome old hawthorn, well plaiſtered on the inſide with
clay, ſtraw, and hair.</p>
               <p>Pleaſing, however, as this bird may be, the blue-bird,
deſcribed by Bellonius, is in every reſpect far ſuperior. This beautiful
animal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reſembles a black-bird in all but its blue colour. It lives
in the higheſt parts of the Alps, and even there chuſes the moſt craggy
rocks and the moſt frightful precipices for its reſidence. As it is rarely
caught, it is in high eſtimation even in the countries where it breeds, but
ſtill more valuable when carried from home. It not only whiſtles in the
moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0823900105:352"/> manner, but ſpeaks with an
articulate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct voice. It is ſo docile, and obſerves all things with
ſuch diligence, that, though waked at midnight by any of the family, it will
ſpeak and whiſtle at the word of command. Its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, about the beginning
of winter, from blue becomes black, which changes to its original hue on the
firſt approaches of ſpring. It makes its neſt in deep holes, in very high
and inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſolitudes, and removes it not only from the
acceſſes of man, but alſo hides it with ſurprizing cunning from the
ſhammoy, and other wild beaſts that might annoy its young.</p>
               <p>The manner of taking this beautiful bird is ſaid to be this.
The fowlers, either by chance or by lying in wait, having found out the place
where it builds, take with them a ſtrong ſtilt or ſtake, ſuch as the
climbers of rocks make uſe of to aſſiſt them in their aſcent. With
the aſſiſtance of this, they mount where an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpectator
would think it impoſſible to aſcend, covering their heads at the ſame
time to ward off any danger of the falling of pebbles or ſtones from above.
At length, with extreme toil and danger, having arrived at the neſt, they
draw it up from the hole in which it is uſually buried, and cheriſh the
young with an aſſiduity equal to the pains they took to obtain them. It 
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0823900105:353"/> produces for the moſt part five young, and never more;
it ſeldom deſcends into the plain country; flies ſwifter than a
black-bird, and uſes the ſame food.</p>
               <p>The field-fare and the red-wing make but a ſhort ſtay in
this country. With us they are inſipid tuneleſs birds, flying in flocks,
and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively watchful to preſerve the general ſafety. All their
ſeaſon of muſic and pleaſure is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the more northern
climates, where they ſing moſt delightfully, perched among the foreſts of
maples, with which thoſe countries abound. They build their neſts in
hedges; and lay ſix bluiſh green eggs ſpotted with black.</p>
               <p>The Stare, diſtinguiſhable from the reſt of this tribe by
the gloſſy green of its feathers, in ſome lights, and the purple in
others, breeds in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low trees, eaves of houſes, towers, ruins, cliffs, and
often in high rocks over the ſea. It lays four or five eggs of a pale
greeniſh aſh-colour; and makes it neſt of ſtraw, ſmall fibres of
roots, and ſuch like. Its voice is rougher than the reſt of this kind; but
what it wants in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of its note, it compenſates by the facility with
which it is taught to ſpeak. In winter theſe birds aſſemble in vaſt
flocks, and feed upon worms and inſects. At the approach of ſpring, they
aſſemble in fields, as if in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation <pb n="324" facs="tcp:0823900105:354"/>
together, and for three or four days ſeem to take no nouriſhment: the
greater part leave the country; the reſt breed here and bring up their
young.</p>
               <p>To this tribe might be added above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other birds of
nearly the thruſh ſize, and living like them upon fruit and berries. Words
could not afford variety enough to deſcribe all the beautiful tints that
adorn the foreign birds of the thruſh kind. The brilliant green of the
emerald, the flaming red of the ruby, the purple of the amethyſt, or the
bright blue of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, could not by the moſt artful combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
ſhew any thing ſo truely lively or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to the ſight as the
feathers of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coqui or the tautotol. Paſſing, therefore, over
theſe beautiful, but little known, birds, I will only mention the American
mock-bird, the favourite ſongſter of a region where the birds excel rather
in the beauty of their plumage than the ſweetneſs of their notes.</p>
               <p>This valuable bird does not ſeem to vie with the feathered
inhabitants of that country in the beauty of its plumage, content with
qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications that endear it to mankind much more. It is but a plain bird to
the eye, about the ſize of a thruſh, of a white and grey colour, and a
reddiſh bill. It is poſſeſſed not only of its own 
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0823900105:355"/> natural notes, which are muſical and ſolemn, but it
can aſſume the tone of every other animal in the wood, from the wolf to the
raven. It ſeems even to ſport itſelf in leading them aſtray. It will at
one time allure the leſſer birds with the call of their males, and then
terrify them when they have come near with the ſcreams of the eagle. There is
no bird in the foreſt but it can mimick; and there is none that it has not at
times deceived by its call. But, not like ſuch as we uſually ſee famed
for mimicking with us, and who have no particular merit of their own, the mock
bird is ever ſureſt to pleaſe when it is moſt itſelf. At thoſe
times it uſually frequents the houſes of the American planters; and,
ſitting all night on the chimney-top, pours forth the ſweeteſt and the
moſt various notes of any bird whatever. It would ſeem, if accounts be
true, that the deficiency of moſt other ſong-birds in that country is made
up by this bird alone. They often build their neſts in the fruit-trees about
houſes, feed upon berries and other fruits, and are eaſily rendered
domeſtic.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the Nightingale and other ſoft billed
Song-Birds.</head>
               <p>THE Nightingale is not only famous among the moderns for its
ſinging, but almoſt every one of the ancients who undertook to deſcribe
beautiful nature, has contributed to raiſe its reputation. 
<q rend="inline">"The nightingale," ſays Pliny, "that, for
fifteen days and nights hid in the thickeſt ſhades, continues her note
without intermiſſion, deſerves our attention and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. How
ſurpriſing that ſo great a voice can reſide in ſo ſmall a body!
ſuch perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſo minute an animal! With what a muſical
propriety are the ſounds it produces modulated! The note at one time drawn
out with a long breath, now ſtealing off into a different cadence, now
interrupted by a break, then changing into a new note by an unexpected
tranſition, now ſeeming to renew the ſame ſtrain, then deceiving
expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation! She ſometimes ſeems to murmur within herſelf; full, deep,
ſharp, ſwift, drawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, trembling; now at the top, the middle, and the
bottom of the ſcale! In ſhort, in <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0823900105:357"/> that little bill
ſeems to reſide all the melody which man has vainly laboured to bring from
a variety of muſical inſtruments. Some even ſeem to be poſſeſſed
of a different ſong from the reſt, and contend with each other with great
ardour. The bird overcome is then ſeen only to diſcontinue its ſong with
its life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This moſt famous of the feathered tribe viſits England in
the beginning of April, and leaves us in Auguſt. It is found but in ſome of
the ſouthern parts of the country, being totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in Scotland,
Ireland, or North Wales. They frequent thick hedges and low coppices, and
generally keep in the middle of the buſh, ſo that they are rarely ſeen.
They begin their ſong in the evening, and generally continue it for the whole
night. For weeks together, if undiſturbed, they ſit upon the ſame tree;
and Shakeſpear rightly deſcribes the nightingale ſitting nightly in the
ſame place, which I have frequently obſerved ſhe ſeldom parts from.</p>
               <p>From Pliny's deſcription, we ſhould be led to believe this
bird poſſeſſed of a perſevering ſtrain; but, though it is in fact
ſo with the nightingale in Italy, yet in our hedges in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the little
ſongſtreſs is by no means ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral of her muſic. Her note is
ſoft, various, and interrupted; ſhe ſeldom holds it without a 
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0823900105:358"/> pauſe above the time that one can count twenty. The
nightingale's pauſing ſong would be the proper epithet for this bird's
muſic with us, which is more pleaſing than the warbling of any other bird,
becauſe it is heard at a time when all the reſt are ſilent.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of May, the nightingale prepares to make its
neſt, which is formed of the leaves of trees, ſtraw and moſs. The neſt
being very eagerly ſought after, is as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſecreted; ſo that but
very few of them are found by the boys when they go upon theſe purſuits. It
is built at the bottom of hedges, where the buſhes are thickeſt and beſt
covered. While the female continues ſitting, the male at a good diſtance,
but always within hearing, chears the patient hour with his voice, and, by the
ſhort interruption of his ſong, often gives her warning of approaching
danger. She lays four or five eggs; of which but a part, in our cold climate,
come to maturity.</p>
               <p>The delicacy, or rather the fame, of this bird's muſic, has
induced many to abridge its liberty to be ſecured of its ſong. Indeed, the
greateſt part of what has been written concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in our country,
conſiſts in directions how to manage it for domeſtic ſinging; while the
hiſtory of the bird is confined to dry receipts <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0823900105:359"/> for
fitting it for the cage. Its ſong, however, in captivity is not ſo very
alluring; and the tyranny of taking it from thoſe hedges where only it is
moſt pleaſing, ſtill more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciates its impriſoned efforts. Geſner
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that it is not only the moſt agreeable ſongſter in a
cage, but that it is poſſeſſed of a moſt admirable faculty of
talking. He tells the following ſtory in proof of his aſſertion, which he
ſays was communicated to him by a friend. 
<q rend="inline">"Whilſt I was at Ratiſbone," ſays his
correſpondent, "I put up at an inn, the ſign of the Golden Crown, where my
hoſt had three nightingales. What I am going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat is wonderful,
almoſt incredible, and yet is true. The nightingales were placed
ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, ſo that each was ſhut up by itſelf in a dark cage. It
happened at that time, being the ſpring of the year, when thoſe birds are
wont to ſing indefatigably, that I was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the ſtone, that
I could ſleep but very little all night. It was uſual then about midnight,
when there was no noiſe in the houſe, but all ſtill, to hear the two
nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales jangling, and talking with each other, and plainly imitating
men's diſcourſes. For my part I was almoſt aſtoniſhed with wonder;
for at this time, when all was quiet elſe, they <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0823900105:360"/> held
conference together, and repeated what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had heard among the gueſts
by day. Thoſe two of them that were moſt notable, and maſters of this
art, were ſcarce ten foot diſtant from one another. The third hung more
remote, ſo that I could not ſo well hear it as I lay abed. But it is
wonderful to tell how thoſe two provoked each other; and by anſwering,
invited and drew one another to ſpeak. Yet did they not confound their words,
or talk both together, but rather utter them alternately and of courſe.
Beſides, the daily diſcourſe of the gueſts, they chanted out two
ſtories, which generally held them from midnight till morning; and that with
ſuch modulations and inflections, that no man could have taken to come from
ſuch little creatures. When I aſked the hoſt if they had been taught, or
whether he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their talking in the night, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, no: the
ſame ſaid the whole family. But I, who could not ſleep for nights
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, was perfectly ſenſible of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. One of their
ſtories was concerning the tapſter and his wife, who refuſed to follow
him to the wars as he deſired her; for the huſband endeavoured to
perſuade his wife, as far as I underſtood by the birds, that he 
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0823900105:361"/> would leave his ſervice in that inn, and go to the
wars in hopes of plunder. But ſhe refuſed to follow him, reſolving to
ſtay either at Ratiſbone, or go to Nuremberg. There was a long and
earneſt contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and all this dialogue the birds repeated.
They even repeated the unſeemly words which were caſt out between them, and
which ought rather to have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and kept a ſecret. But the
birds, not knowing the difference between modeſt, immodeſt, honeſt and
filthy words, did out with them. The other ſtory was concerning the war which
the emperor was then threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening againſt the proteſtants; which the birds
probably heard from ſome of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals that had conferences in the
houſe. Theſe things did they repeat in the night after twelve o'clock, when
there was a deep ſilence. But in the day-time, for the moſt part, they were
ſilent, and ſeemed to do nothing but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and revolve with
themſelves upon what the gueſts conferred together as they ſat at table,
or in their walks. I verily had never believed our Pliny writing ſo many
wonderful things concerning theſe little creatures, had I not myſelf ſeen
with my eyes, and heard them with my ears uttering ſuch things as I have 
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0823900105:362"/> related. Neither yet can I of a ſudden write all or
call to rememberance every particular that I have heard."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the ſagacity aſcribed to the nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale; it is but
to have high reputation for any one quality, and the world is ready enough to
give us fame for others to which we have very ſmall pretenſions. But there
is a little bird, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther celebrated for its affection to mankind than its
ſinging, which however, in our climate, has the ſweeteſt note of all
others. The reader already perceives that I mean the red-breaſt, the well
known friend of man, that is found in every hedge, and makes it vocal. The note
of other birds is louder, and their inflections more capricious; but this
bird's voice is ſoft, tender, and well ſupported; and the more to be valued
as we enjoy it the greateſt part of the winter. If the nightingale's ſong
has been compared to the fiddle, the red-breaſt's voice has all the delicacy
of the flute.</p>
               <p>The red-breaſt, during the ſpring, haunts the wood, the
grove, and the garden; it retires to the thickeſt and ſhadieſt hedge-rows
to breed in. But in winter it ſeems to become more domeſtic, and often to
claim protection from man. Moſt of the ſoft billed birds, the nightingale,
the ſwallow, and the tit-mouſe, <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0823900105:363"/> leave us in the
winter, when their inſect food is no longer offered in plenty; but the
red-breaſt continues with us the year round, and endeavours to ſupport the
famine of winter by chirping round the warm habitations of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by coming
into thoſe ſhelters where the rigour of the ſeaſon is artificially
expelled, and where inſects themſelves are found in greater numbers,
attracted by the ſame cauſe.</p>
               <p>This bird breeds differently in different places: in ſome
countries, its neſt is uſually found in the crevice of ſome moſſy
bank, or at the foot of an hawthorn in hedge-rows; in others, it chuſes the
thickeſt coverts, and hides its neſt with oak leaves. The eggs are from
four to five, of a dull white, with reddiſh ſtreaks.</p>
               <p>The lark, whether the ſky lark, the wood, or the tit-lark,
being all diſtinguiſhable from other little birds by the length of their
heel, are louder in their ſong than either of the former, but not ſo
pleaſing. Indeed, the muſic of every bird in captivity produces no very
pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſations; it is but the mirth of a little animal
inſenſible of its unfortunate ſituation; it is the landſcape, the
grove, the golden break of day, the conteſt upon the hawthorn, the fluttering
from branch to branch, the ſoaring in the air, and the anſwering of its
young, <pb n="334" facs="tcp:0823900105:364"/> that gives the bird's ſong its true reliſh.
Theſe united, improve each other, and raiſe the mind to a ſtate of the
higheſt, yet moſt harmleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation. Nothing can in this ſituation
of mind be more pleaſing than to ſee the lark warbling upon the wing;
raiſing its note as it ſoars until it ſeems loſt in the immenſe
heights above us; the note continuing, the bird itſelf unſeen; to ſee it
then deſcending with a ſwell as it comes from the clouds, yet ſinking by
degrees as it approaches its neſt, the ſpot where all its affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are
centered; the ſpot that has prompted all this joy.</p>
               <p>The lark builds its neſt upon the ground, beneath ſome turf
that ſerves to hide and ſhelter it. The female lays four or five eggs, of a
duſky hue in colour, ſomewhat like thoſe of a plover. It is while ſhe
is ſitting that the male thus uſually entertains her with his ſinging;
and while he is riſen to an imperceptible height, yet he ſtill has his
loved partner in his eye, nor once loſes ſight of the neſt either while
he aſcends or is deſcending. This harmony continues ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months,
beginning early in the ſpring on pairing. In winter they aſſemble in
flocks, when their ſong forſakes them, and the bird-catchers deſtroy them
in great numbers for the tables of the luxurious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0823900105:365"/>The Black-cap and the Wren, though ſo
very diminutive, are yet prized by ſome for their ſinging. The former is
called by ſome the mock nightingale; and the latter is admired for the
loudneſs of its note, compared to the little body from whence it iſſues.
It muſt be confeſſed that this diſproportion between the voice of a
bird and its ſize, in ſome meaſure demands our wonder. Quadrupedes in
this reſpect may be conſidered as mutes to them. The peacock is louder than
the lion, and the rabbit is not ſo loud as the wren. But it muſt be
conſidered that birds are very differently formed; their lungs in ſome
meaſure are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended through their whole body, while in quadrupedes they lie
only in the breaſt. In birds there are a variety of cells which take in the
air, and thus pour forth their contents at the little animal's command. The
black-cap and the wren, therefore, are as reſpectable for their voices as
they might be deemed incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for their ſize.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſoft billed birds, thus prized for their
ſinging, are rendered domeſtic, and brought up with aſſiduity by ſuch
as are fond of their voices in a cage. The ſame method of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſerves
for all, as their food and their habits are nearly the ſame. The manner of
taking <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0823900105:366"/> and treating them, particularly the nightingale,
is this. A nightingale's neſt may be found by obſerving the place where the
male ſings, and then by ſticking two or three meal-worms (a kind of maggot
found in flower on ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring thorn, which when he ſees he will
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly bear away to his young. By liſtening, he then may be heard with
the female chirping to the young ones while they are feeding. When the neſt
is found, if the young ones are not fledged enough to be taken, they muſt not
be touched with the hands, for then the old ones will perceive it, and entice
them away. They ſhould not be taken till they are almoſt as full of
feathers as the old ones; and, though they refuſe their meat, yet, by opening
their bills, you may give them two or three ſmall bits at a time, which will
make them ſoon grow tame, when they will feed themſelves. They ſhould be
put neſt and all into a little baſket, which ſhould be covered up warm;
and they ſhould be fed every two hours. Their food ſhould be ſheep's
hearts, or other raw fleſh meat, chopped very fine, and all the ſtrings,
ſkins, and fat, taken away. But it ſhould always be mixed with hard hen's
eggs, upon which they will feed and thrive abundantly.</p>
               <p>They ſhould then be put in cages like the 
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0823900105:367"/> nightingale's back cage, with a little ſtraw or dry
moſs at the bottom; but when they are grown large they ſhould have ant's
mold. They ſhould be kept very clean, as indeed ſhould all ſinging-birds
whatſoever; for otherwiſe they will have the cramp, and perhaps the claws
will drop off. In autumn they will ſometimes abſtain from their food for a
fortnight, unleſs two or three meal-worms be given them twice or thrice a
week, or two or three ſpiders in a day; they muſt likewiſe have a little
ſaffron in their water. Figs chopped ſmall among their meat will help them
to recover their fleſh. When their legs are cramped, they ſhould be
anointed with freſh butter, or capon's fat, three or four days together. If
they grow melancholly, put white ſugar-candy into their water, and feed them
with ſheep's-heart, giving them three or four meal-worms in a day, and a few
ants with their eggs. They ſhould alſo have ſaffron in their water.</p>
               <p>With regard to adult birds, thoſe that are taken before the
twenty-third of April are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the beſt, becauſe after that they
begin to pair. They uſually haunt woods, coppices, and quickſet hedges,
where they may be taken in trap cages baited with meal-worms. They ſhould be
placed as near the ſpot where the <pb n="338" facs="tcp:0823900105:368"/> bird ſings as
poſſible; and before you fix the trap, turn up the earth twice the breadth
of the cage, becauſe they will there look for food. They are alſo taken
with lime twigs, placing them upon the hedge where they uſually ſing; and
there ſhould be meal-worms ſtuck at proper places to draw them into the
ſnare. After they are taken, their wings ſhould be gently tied with thread,
to prevent their beating themſelves againſt the cage. This ſhould be
firſt hung in a private place, that the bird may not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed; and it
ſhould be fed every two hours, at fartheſt, with ſheep's-heart and egg
minced very fine, mixing it with meal-worms. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the firſt food muſt
be worms, ants, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars, and flies. You muſt, to feed the bird, take it
in your hand, and open the bill with a ſtick made thick at one end, giving it
the inſects, or four or five bits of food as big as peas, to entice it to
eat. Its common food ſhould be mixed with ants, ſo that when the bird goes
to pick the ants it may pick up ſome of that alſo. The nightingale, when
caged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſing about the latter end of November, and continues its
ſong till June.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Canary-bird, and other hard billed
Singing-birds.</head>
               <p>THE Canary-bird is now become ſo common, and has continued
ſo long in a domeſtic ſtate, that its native habits, as well as its
native country, ſeem almoſt forgotten. Though, by the name, it appears that
theſe birds came ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from the Canary Iſlands, yet we have it only
from Germany, where they are bred up in great numbers, and ſold into
different parts of Europe. At what period they were brought into Europe is not
well known; but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that about a century ago they were ſold at
very high prices, and kept only for the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great. They have
ſince been multiplied in great abundance; and their price is diminiſhed in
proportion to their plenty.</p>
               <p>In its native iſlands, a region equally noted for the beauty
of its landſcapes and the harmony of its groves, the canary-bird is of a
duſky grey colour, and ſo different from thoſe uſually ſeen in
Europe, that ſome have even doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of the ſame ſpecies.
With us, they have that variety of colouring uſual in all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic 
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0823900105:370"/> fowls; ſome white, ſome mottled, ſome beautifully
ſhaded with green; but they are more eſteemed for their note than their
beauty, having a high piercing pipe, as indeed all thoſe of the finch tribe
have, continuing for ſome time in one breath without intermiſſion, then
raiſing it higher and higher by degrees, with great variety.</p>
               <p>It is this that has rendered the canary-bird next to the
nightingale the moſt celebrated ſongſter; and, as it is more eaſily
reared than any of the ſoft billed birds, and continues its ſong throughout
the year, it is rather the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in our houſes. Rules, therefore,
have been laid down, and copious inſtructions given, for breeding theſe
birds in a domeſtic ſtate; which, as a part of them may conduce towards the
natural hiſtory of the bird, I will take leave to tranſcribe.</p>
               <p>In chuſing the canary-bird, thoſe are beſt that appear
with life and boldneſs, ſtanding upright upon the perch like a
ſparrow-hawk, and not apt to be frighted at every thing that ſtirs. If its
eyes look chearful, and not drowſy, it is a ſign of health; but, on the
contrary, if it hides its head under the wing, and gathers its body up, theſe
are ſymptoms of its being out of order. In chuſing them the melody of the 
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0823900105:371"/> ſong ſhould alſo be minded: ſome will open with
the notes of the nightingale, and, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through a variety of modulations,
end like the tit-lark. Others will begin like the ſky-lark; and, by a ſoft
melodious turn, fall into the notes of the nightingale. Theſe are leſſons
taught this bird in its domeſtic ſtate, and generally taught it by others;
but its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive note is loud, ſhrill, piercing, and enough to deafen the
hearers. There are perſons who admire each of theſe ſongs, but the
ſecond is in the moſt general eſtimation.</p>
               <p>Canary-birds ſometimes breed all the year round; but they
moſt uſually begin to pair in April, and to breed in June and Auguſt.
Thoſe are ſaid to be the beſt breeders that are produced between the
Engliſh and the French.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter end of March, a cock and a hen ſhould be
put together in a ſmall cage, where they will peck at each other in the
beginning, but will ſoon become thoroughly reconciled. The room where they
are kept to breed ſhould be ſo ſituated as to let the birds have the
benefit of the morning ſun, and the windows ſhould be of wire, not glaſs,
that they may enjoy the benefit of the air. The floor of the room ſhould be
kept clean, and ſometimes there ſhould be dry gravel or ſand ſifted
upon <pb n="342" facs="tcp:0823900105:372"/> it. There ſhould alſo be two windows, one at
each end, and ſeveral perches at proper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for the birds to
ſettle on, as they fly backwards and forwards. A tree in the middle of the
room would be the moſt convenient to divert the birds, and ſometimes to
ſerve for building their neſts upon.</p>
               <p>In Germany they prepare a large room, and build it in the manner
of a barn, being much longer than broad, with a ſquare place at each end, and
ſeveral holes to go into thoſe ſquare places. In thoſe outlets they
plant ſeveral ſorts of trees, in which the birds take great delight to
ſing and breed. The bottom of the place they ſtrew with ſand, and upon it
caſt rape-ſeed, chick-weed and groundſil, which the old birds feed upon
while breeding. In the body of the houſe they put all ſorts of ſtuff for
building the neſt, and brooms, one under the other, in all the corners, for
the birds to build in. Theſe they ſeparate by partitions from each other,
to prevent thoſe above flying down upon, or otherwiſe incommoding ſuch as
breed below. The light alſo is excluded, for no bird is fond of having light
come to its neſt.</p>
               <p>With us, the apparatus for breeding is leſs expenſive; a
little breeding-cage ſometimes ſuffices, but ſeldom any thing more
extenſive <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0823900105:373"/> than a ſmall room. While the birds are
pairing it is uſual to feed them with ſoft meat; that is, bread,
maw-ſeed, a little ſcalded rape-ſeed, and near a third part of an egg.
The room ſhould be furniſhed with ſtuff for making their neſts; ſuch
as fine hay, wool, cotton, and hair. Theſe materials ſhould be thoroughly
dry, and then mixed and tied together in ſuch a manner that the birds may
readily pull out what they want. This ſhould be hung in a proper part of the
room, and the male will take his turn in building the neſt, ſitting upon
the eggs, and feeding the young. They are generally two or three days in
building their neſts; the hen commonly lays five eggs; and in the ſpace of
fourteen days the young will be excluded. So prolific are theſe birds
ſometimes that the female will be ready to hatch a ſecond brood before the
firſt are able to quit the neſt. On theſe occaſions, ſhe leaves the
neſt and the young to provide herſelf with another to lay her new brood in.
In the mean time, the male, more faithful to the duties of his truſt, breeds
up the young left behind, and fits them for a ſtate of independance.</p>
               <p>When the young ones are excluded, the old ones ſhould be
ſupplied with a ſufficiency of ſoft food every day, with likewiſe
freſh greens, <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0823900105:374"/> ſuch as cabbage, lettuce, and
chick-weed; in June, ſhepherd's purſe; and in July and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, plantane.
They are never to have groundſil after the young are excluded. With theſe
different delicacies, the old ones will take particular care to feed and bring
up their young; but it is uſual when they can feed themſelves to be taken
from the neſt and put into cages. Their meat then is the yolk of an egg
boiled hard, with an equal quantity of fine bread, and a little ſcalded
rape-ſeed: this muſt be bruiſed till it becomes fine, and then it may be
mixed with a little maw-ſeed; after which, blend all together; which is to be
ſupplied them freſh every day.</p>
               <p>The canary-bird, by being kept in company with the linnet or the
gold-finch, pairs and produces a mixed breed, more like the canary-bird, and
reſembling it chiefly in its ſong. Indeed, all this tribe with ſtrong
bills and piercing notes, and feeding upon grain, have the moſt ſtrong
ſimilitude to each other, and may juſtly be ſuppoſed, as Mr. Buffon
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, to come from the ſame original. They all breed about the ſame
time; they frequent the ſame vegetables; they build in the ſame hedges and
trees; and are brought up for the cage with the ſame food and precautions.
The linnet, the bull-finch, and the gold-finch, when <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0823900105:375"/> we
know the hiſtory of the canary-bird, have ſcarce any peculiarities that can
attract our curioſity, or require our care. The only art neceſſary with
all thoſe that have no very fine note is to breed them up under ſome more
pleaſing harmoniſt. The gold-finch learns a fine ſong from the
nightingale; and the linnet and bull-finch may be taught, forgetting the wild
notes of nature, to whiſtle a long and regular tune.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the Swallow and its Affinities.</head>
               <p>AN idea of any one bird in the former claſſes will give us
ſome tolerable conception of the reſt. By knowing the linnet, or the
canary-bird, we have ſome notion of the manners of the gold-finch; by
exhibiting the hiſtory of the nightingale, we ſee alſo that of the
black-cap or the tit-mouſe. But the ſwallow tribe ſeems to be entirely
different from all the former: different in their form, different in their
habits, and unlike in all the particulars of their hiſtory.</p>
               <p>In this tribe is to be found the Goat ſucker, which may be
ſtyled a nocturnal ſwallow: it is the largeſt of this kind, and is known
by its tail, which is not forked, like that of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſwallow. It begins
its flight at evening, and makes a loud ſingular noiſe, like the whur of a
ſpinning-wheel. To this alſo belongs the Houſe-ſwallow, which is too
well known to need a deſcription: the Martin, inferior in ſize to the
former, and the tail much leſs forked; it differs alſo in its neſt, which
is covered at top, while that of the houſe-ſwallow is open; and the Swift,
rather larger than the houſe-ſwallow, with all the <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0823900105:377"/>
toes ſtanding forward; in which it differs from the reſt of its kind. All
theſe reſemble each other ſo ſtrongly, that it is not without
difficulty the ſmaller kinds are known aſunder.</p>
               <p>Theſe are all known by their very large mouths, which, when
they fly, are always kept open; they are not leſs remarkable for their
ſhort ſlender feet, which ſcarce are able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weight of
their bodies; their wings are of immoderate extent for their bulk; their
plumage is gloſſed with a rich purple; and their note is a ſlight
twittering, which they ſeldom exert but upon the wing.</p>
               <p>This peculiar conformation ſeems attended with a ſimilar
peculiarity of manners. Their food is inſects, which they always purſue
flying. For this reaſon, during fine weather, when the inſects are moſt
likely to be abroad, the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows are for ever upon the wing, and ſeen
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing their prey with amazing ſwiftneſs and agility. All ſmaller
animals, in ſome meaſure, find ſafety by winding and turning, when they
endeavour to avoid the greater: the lark thus evades the purſuit of the hawk;
and man the crocodile. In this manner, inſects upon the wing endeavour to
avoid the ſwallow; but this bird is admirably fitted by nature to purſue
them through their ſhorteſt turnings. Beſides a <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0823900105:378"/>
great length of wing, it is alſo provided with a long tail, which, like a
rudder, turns it in its moſt rapid motions; and thus, while it is
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the greateſt ſwiftneſs, it is alſo
poſſeſſed of the moſt extreme agility.</p>
               <p>Early, therefore, in the ſpring, when the returning ſun
begins to rouze the inſect tribe from their annual ſtate of torpidity, when
the gnat and the beetle put off their earthly robes and venture into air, the
ſwallow then is ſeen returning from its long migration beyond the ocean,
and making its way feebly to the ſhore. At firſt, with the timidity of a
ſtranger, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears but ſeldom, and flies but ſlowly and heavily along.
As the weather grows warmer, and its inſect ſupply encreaſes, it then
gathers greater ſtrength and activity. But it ſometimes happens that a
rainy ſeaſon, by repelling the inſects, ſtints the ſwallow in its
food; the poor bird is then ſeen ſlowly ſkimming along the ſurface of
the ground, and often reſting after a flight of a few minutes. In general,
however, it keeps on the wing, and moving with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity that nothing can
eſcape. When the weather promiſes to be fair, the inſect tribe feel the
genial influence, and make bolder flights; at which time the ſwallow follows
them in their aerial journeys, and often riſes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible 
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0823900105:379"/> heights in the purſuit. When the weather is likely to
be foul, the inſects feel the firſt notices of it; and from the ſwallow's
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing low we are often apprized of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching change.</p>
               <p>When ſummer is fairly begun, and more than a ſufficient
ſupply for ſuſtaining the wants of nature every where offers, the
ſwallow then begins to think of forming a progeny. The neſt is built with
great induſtry and art; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the common ſwallow, which builds
it on the tops of chimnies. The martin ſticks it to the eaves of houſes.
The goat-ſucker, as we are told, builds it on the bare ground. This neſt is
built with mud from ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring brook, well tempered with the bill,
moiſtened with water for the better adheſion; and ſtill farther kept
firm, by long graſs and fibres: within it is lined with gooſe feathers,
which are ever the warmeſt and the neateſt. The martin covers its neſt at
top, and has a door to enter at; the ſwallow leaves her's quite open. But our
European neſts are nothing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with thoſe the ſwallow builds
on the coaſts of China and Coromandel; the deſcription of which I will
give, in the plain honeſt phraſe of Willoughby. 
<q rend="inline">"On the ſea-coaſt of the kingdom of China,"
ſays he, "a ſort of <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0823900105:380"/> party-coloured birds, of the
ſhape of ſwallows, at a certain ſeaſon of the year, which is their
breeding-time, come out of the mid-land country to the rocks, and from the foam
or froth of the ſea-water daſhing againſt the bottom of the rocks, gather
a certain clammy, glutinous matter, perchance the ſpawn of whales or other
young fiſhes, of which they build their neſts, wherein they lay their eggs
and hatch their young. Theſe neſts the Chineſe pluck from the rocks, and
bring them, in great numbers, into the Eaſt-Indies to ſell. They are
eſteemed, by gluttons, as great delicacies; who, diſſolving them in
chicken or mutton-broth, are very fond of them; far before oyſters,
muſhrooms, or other dainty and lickoriſh morſels."</q> What a pity this
luxury hath not been introduced among us; and then our great feaſters might
be enabled to eat a little more!</p>
               <p>The ſwallow uſually lays from five to ſix eggs, of a white
colour, ſpeckled with red; and ſometimes breeds twice a year. When the
young brood are excluded, the ſwallow ſupplies them very plentifully, the
firſt brood particularly, when ſhe finds herſelf capable of producing two
broods in a year. This happens when the parents come early, when the ſeaſon
is peculiarly mild, <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0823900105:381"/> and when they begin to pair ſoon.
Sometimes they find a difficulty in rearing even a ſingle neſt,
particularly when the weather has been ſevere, or their neſts have been
robbed in the beginning of the ſeaſon. By theſe accidents, this
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant taſk is ſometimes deferred to the middle of September.</p>
               <p>At the latter end of September they leave us; and for a few days
previous to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, aſſemble, in vaſt flocks, on houſe-tops,
as if deliberating on the fatiguing journey that lay before them. This is no
ſlight under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, as their flight is directed to Congo, Senegal, and along
the whole Morocco ſhore. There are ſome, however, left behind in this
general expedition, that do not part till eight or ten days after the reſt.
Theſe are chiefly the latter weakly broods, which are not yet in a condition
to ſet out. They are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even too feeble to venture, till the
ſetting in of winter; while their parents vainly exhort them to efforts which
inſtinct aſſures them they are incapable of performing. Thus it often
happens, that the wretched little families, being compelled to ſtay, periſh
the firſt cold weather that comes; while the tender parents ſhare the fate
of their offspring, and die with their new-fledged brood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0823900105:382"/>Thoſe that migrate, are firſt
obſerved to arrive in Africa, as Mr. Adanſon aſſures us, about the
beginning of October. They are thought to have performed their fatiguing
journey in the ſpace of ſeven days. They are ſometimes ſeen, when
interrupted by contrary winds, wavering in their courſe far off at ſea, and
lighting upon whatever ſhip they find in their paſſage. They then ſeem
ſpent with famine and fatigue; yet ſtill they boldly venture, when
refreſhed by a few hours reſt, to renew their flight, and continue the
courſe which they had been ſteering before.</p>
               <p>Theſe are facts, proved by inconteſtible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; yet it
is a doubt whether all ſwallows migrate in this manner, or whether there may
not be ſome ſpecies of this animal that, though externally alike, are ſo
internally different, as to be very differently affected by the approach of
winter. We are aſſured, from many, and theſe not contemptible
witneſſes, that ſwallows hide themſelves in holes under ground, joined
cloſe together, bill againſt bill, and feet againſt feet. Some inform us
that they have ſeen them taken out of the water, and even from under the ice,
in bunches, where they are aſſerted to paſs the winter without motion.
Reaumur, who particularly intereſted himſelf in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, 
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0823900105:383"/> received ſeveral accounts of bundles of ſwallows
being thus found in quarries and under the water. Theſe men, therefore, have
a right to ſome degree of aſſent; and are not to loſe all credit from
our ignorance of what they aver.</p>
               <p>All, however, that we have hitherto diſſected, are formed
within like other birds; and ſeem to offer no obſervable variety. Indeed,
that they do not hide themſelves under water, has been pretty well proved, by
the noted experiment of Friſch, who tied ſeveral threads died in
water-colours, round the legs of a great number of ſwallows, that were
preparing for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture: theſe, upon their return the enſuing
ſummer, brought their threads back with them, no way damaged in their colour;
which they moſt certainly would, if, during the winter, they had been
ſteeped in water: yet ſtill this is a ſubject on which we muſt
ſuſpend our aſſent, as Klein, the naturaliſt, has brought ſuch a
number of proofs, in defence of his opinion, that ſwallows are torpid in
winter, as even the moſt incredulous muſt allow to have ſome degree of
probability.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Humming-bird and its Varieties.</head>
               <p>HAVING given ſome hiſtory of the manners of the moſt
remarkable birds of which accounts can be obtained, I might now go to a very
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive tribe, remarkable for the ſplendour and the variety of their
plumage: but the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the colours of a beautiful bird, has
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it that can inform or entertain; it rather excites a longing, which
it is impoſſible for words to ſatisfy. Naturaliſts, indeed, have
endeavoured to ſatisfy this deſire, by coloured prints; but, beſide that
theſe at beſt give only a faint reſemblance of nature, and are a very
indifferent kind of painting, the bird itſelf has a thouſand beauties, that
the moſt exquiſite artiſt is incapable of imitating. They, for
inſtance, who imagine they have a complete idea of the beauty of the little
tribe of Manikin birds, from the pictures we have of them, will find
themſelves deceived, when they compare their draughts with nature. The
ſhining greens, the changeable purples, and the gloſſy reds, are beyond
the reach of the pencil; and very far beyond the coloured print, which is but a
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0823900105:385"/> poor ſubſtitute to painting. I have therefore
declined entering into a minute deſcription of foreign birds of the ſparrow
kind; as ſounds would never convey an adequate idea of colours.</p>
               <p>There is one ſpecies, however, that I will conclude the
hiſtory of this claſs with; as, though the leaſt, it will certainly be
allowed the moſt beautiful of all others. In quadrupedes, the ſmalleſt
animals are noxious, ugly and loathſome; the ſmalleſt of birds are the
moſt beautiful, innocent and ſportive. Of all thoſe that flutter in the
garden, or paint the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, the Humming-bird is the moſt delightful to
look upon, and the moſt inoffenſive.</p>
               <p>Of this charming little animal, there are ſix or ſeven
varieties, from the ſize of a ſmall wren, down to that of an humble-bee. An
European could never have ſuppoſed a bird exiſting ſo very ſmall, and
yet completely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out with a bill, feathers, wings, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, exactly reſembling thoſe of the largeſt kind. A bird not
ſo big as the end of one's little finger, would probably be ſuppoſed but
a creature of imagination, were it not ſeen in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite numbers, and as
frequent as butterflies in a ſummer's day, ſporting in the fields of
Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, from flower to flower, and extracting their ſweets with its little
bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0823900105:386"/>The ſmalleſt humming-bird is about the
ſize of an hazel-nut. The feathers on its wings and tail are black; but
thoſe on its body, and under its wings, are of a greeniſh brown, with a
fine red caſt or gloſs, which no ſilk or velvet can imitate. It has a
ſmall creſt on its head, green at the bottom, and as it were gilded at the
top; and which ſparkles in the ſun like a little ſtar in the middle of
its forehead. The bill is black, ſtraight, ſlender, and of the length of a
ſmall pin. The larger humming-bird is near half as big as the common wren,
and without a creſt on its head; but, to make amends, it is covered, from the
throat half way down the belly, with changeable crimſon coloured feathers,
that, in different lights, change to a variety of beautiful colours, much like
an opal. The heads of both are ſmall, with very little round eyes as black as
jet.</p>
               <p>It is inconceivable how much theſe add to the high finiſhing
and beauty of a rich luxurious weſtern landſcape. As ſoon as the ſun is
riſen, the humming-birds, of different kinds, are ſeen fluttering about the
flowers, without ever lighting upon them. Their wings are in ſuch rapid
motion, that it is impoſſible to diſcern their colours, except by their
glittering. They <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0823900105:387"/> are never ſtill, but continually in
motion, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting flower after flower, and extracting its honey as if with a
kiſs. For this purpoſe they are furniſhed with a forky tongue, that
enters the cup of the flower and extracts its nectared tribute. Upon this alone
they ſubſiſt. The rapid motion of their wings brings out an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſound, from whence they have their name; for whatever divides the air
ſwiftly, muſt thus produce a murmur.</p>
               <p>The neſts of theſe birds are not leſs curious than the
reſt: they are ſuſpended in the air, at the point of the twigs of an
orange, a pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, or a citron-tree; ſometimes even in houſes, if they
find a ſmall and convenient twig for the purpoſe. The female is the
architect, while the male goes in queſt of materials; ſuch as cotton, fine
moſs, and the fibres of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables. Of theſe materials a neſt is
compoſed, of about the ſize of an hen's egg cut in two, admirably
contrived, and warmly lined with cotton. They lay two eggs at a time, and never
more, about the ſize of ſmall peas, and as white as ſnow, with here and
there a yellow ſpeck. The male and the female ſit upon the neſt by turns;
but the female takes to herſelf the greateſt ſhare. She ſeldom quits
the neſt, except a few minutes in the morning and <pb n="358" facs="tcp:0823900105:388"/>
evening, when the dew is upon the flowers and their honey in perfection. During
this ſhort interval, the male takes her place; for, as the egg is ſo
ſmall, the expoſing it ever ſo ſhort a time to the weather, would be
apt to injure its contents, the ſurface expoſed being ſo great in
compariſon to the bulk. The time of incubation continues twelve days; at the
end of which the young ones appear, much about the ſize of a blue-bottle fly.
They are at firſt bare; by degrees they are covered with down; and, at
laſt, feathers ſucceed, but leſs beautiful at firſt than thoſe of the
old ones.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Father Labat's companion, in the miſſion to
America, found the neſt of an humming-bird, in a ſhed that was near the
dwelling-houſe, and took it in, at a time when the young ones were about
fifteen or twenty days old; he then placed them in a cage at his chamber
window, to be amuſed by their ſportive flutterings; but he was ſoon
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſee the old ones, that came and fed their brood regularly
every hour in the day. By theſe means they themſelves ſoon grew ſo tame
that they ſeldom quitted the chamber; but, without any conſtraint, came to
live with their young ones. All four have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently come to perch upon their
maſter's <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0823900105:389"/> hand, chirruping as if they had been at
liberty abroad. He fed them with a very fine clear paſte, made of wine,
biſcuit and ſugar. They thruſt their tongues into this paſte, till they
were ſatisfied, and then fluttered and chirruped about the room. I never
beheld any thing more agreeable," continues he, "than this lovely little
family, that had taken poſſeſſion of my companion's chamber, and that
flew out and in juſt as they thought proper; but were ever attentive to the
voice of their maſter, when he called them. In this manner they lived with
him for above ſix months; but, at a time when he expected to ſee a new
colony formed, he unfortunately forgot to tie up their cage to the cieling at
night, to preſerve them from the rats, and he found they were devoured in the

               <p>Theſe birds, on the continent of America, continue to flutter
the year round; as their food, which is the honey of flowers, never forſakes
them in thoſe warm latitudes where they are found. But it is otherwiſe in
the iſlands of the Antilles, where, when the winter ſeaſon approaches,
they retire, and, as ſome ſay, continue in a torpid ſtate during the
ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that ſeaſon. At Surinam and Jamaica, <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0823900105:390"/>
where they conſtantly have flowers, theſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful birds are never known
to diſappear.</p>
               <p>It is a doubt whether or not theſe birds have a continued note
in ſinging. All travellers agree that, beſide the humming noiſe produced
by their wings, they have a little interrupted chirrup; but Labat aſſerts,
that they have a moſt pleaſing melancholy melody in their voices, though
ſmall and proportioned to the organs which produce it. It is very probable
that, in different places, their notes are alſo different; and as there are
ſome that continue torpid all the winter, there may likewiſe be ſome with
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able voices, though the reſt may in general be ſilent.</p>
               <p>The Indians formerly made great uſe of this pretty bird's
plumage, in adorning their belts and head-dreſs. The children take them in
the fields upon rings ſmeared with bird-lime: they approach the place where
the birds are flying, and twirling their rings in the air, ſo allure them,
either by the colour or the ſound, that the ſimple little creature comes to
reſt upon the ring, and is ſeized. They are then inſtantly killed and
gutted, and hung up in the chimney to dry. Thoſe who take greater care, dry
them in a ſtove, which is not ſo likely to injure the plumage as the
foregoing method. Their <pb n="361" facs="tcp:0823900105:391"/> beautiful feathers were once the
ornament of the higheſt rank of ſavage nobility: but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they
take the bird rather for the purpoſe of ſelling it as a curioſity to the
Europeans, than that of ornament for themſelves. All the taſte for ſavage
finery is wearing out faſt, even among the Americans. They now begin to
adopt, if not the dreſſes of Europe, at leaſt the materials of which they
are compoſed. The wandering warrior is far from thinking himſelf fine at
preſent with his bow and his feathered crown: his ambition reaches to higher
orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; a gun, a blue ſhirt and a blanket.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Birds of the Crane Kind in General.</head>
               <p>THE progreſſions of Nature from one claſs of beings to
another, are always by ſlow and almoſt imperceptible degrees. She has
peopled the woods and the fields with a variety of the moſt beautiful birds;
and, to leave no part of her extenſive territories untenanted, ſhe has
ſtocked the waters with its feathered inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants alſo: ſhe has taken
the ſame care in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the wants of her animals in this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as
ſhe has done with reſpect to thoſe of the other: ſhe has uſed as much
precaution to render water-fowl fit for ſwimming, as ſhe did in forming
land-fowl for flight: ſhe has defended their feathers with a natural oil, and
united their toes by a webbed membrane; by which contrivances they have at once
ſecurity and motion. But between the claſſes of land-birds that ſhun
the water, and of water-fowl that are made for ſwimming and living on it,
ſhe has formed a very numerous tribe of birds, that ſeem to partake of a
middle nature; that, with divided toes, ſeemingly fitted to live upon land,
are at the ſame time furniſhed with appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0823900105:394"/> that
chiefly attach them to the waters. Theſe can properly be called neither
land-birds nor water-fowl, as they provide all their ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from
watery places, and yet are unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to ſeek it in thoſe depths where it
is often found in greateſt plenty.</p>
               <p>This claſs of birds, of the crane kind, are to be
diſtinguiſhed from others rather by their appetites than their
conformation. Yet even in this reſpect they ſeem to be ſufficiently
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminated by Nature: as they are to live among the waters, yet are
incapable of ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in them, moſt of them have long legs, fitted for
wading in ſhallow waters, or long bills proper for groping in them.</p>
               <p>Every bird of this kind, habituated to marſhy places, may be
known, if not by the length of its legs, at leaſt by the ſcaly ſurface of
them. Thoſe who have obſerved the legs of a ſnipe or a woodcock, will
eaſily perceive my meaning; and how different the ſurface of the ſkin
that covers them is from that of the pigeon or the partridge. Moſt birds of
this kind alſo, are bare of feathers half way up the thigh; at leaſt, in
all of them, above the knee. Their long habits of wading in the waters, and
having their legs continually in moiſture, prevents the growth of feathers on
thoſe parts; ſo that there is a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0823900105:395"/>
difference between the leg of a crane, naked of feathers almoſt up to the
body, and the falcon, booted almoſt to the very toes.</p>
               <p>The bill alſo is very diſtinguiſhable in moſt of this
claſs. It is, in general, longer than that of other birds, and in ſome
finely fluted on every ſide; while at the point it is poſſeſſed of
extreme ſenſibility, and furniſhed with nerves, for the better feeling
their food at the bottom of marſhes, where it cannot be ſeen. Some birds of
this claſs are thus fitted with every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience: they have long legs, for
wading; long necks, for ſtooping; long bills, for ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and nervous
points, for feeling. Others are not ſo amply provided for; as ſome have
long bills, but legs of no great length; and others have long necks, but very
ſhort legs. It is a rule which univerſally holds, that where the bird's
legs are long, the neck is alſo long in proportion. It would indeed be an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable defect in the bird's conformation, to be lifted upon ſtilts above
its food, without being furniſhed with an inſtrument to reach it.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the natural power of this claſs, in a
comparative view, they will ſeem rather inferior to thoſe of every other
tribe. Their neſts are more ſimple than thoſe of the ſparrow; and their
methods of obtaining food leſs inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious <pb n="368" facs="tcp:0823900105:396"/> than thoſe
of the falcon: the pie exceeds them in cunning; and though they have all the
voraciouſneſs of the poultry tribe; they want their fecundity. None of this
kind, therefore, have been taken into man's ſociety, or under his protection;
they are neither caged, like the nightingale; nor kept tame, like the turkey;
but lead a life of precarious liberty, in fens and marſhes, at the edges of
lakes, and along the ſea-ſhore. They all live upon fiſh or inſects, one
or two only excepted; even thoſe that are called mudſuckers, ſuch as the
ſnipe and the woodcock, it is more than probable, grope the bottom of
marſhy places only for ſuch inſects as are depoſited there by their
kind, and live in a vermicular ſtate, in pools and plaſhes, till they take
wing, and become flying inſects.</p>
               <p>All this claſs, therefore, that are fed upon inſects, their
food being eaſily digeſtible, are good to be eaten; while thoſe who live
entirely upon fiſh, abounding in oil, acquire in their fleſh the rancidity
of their diet, and are, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, unfit for our tables. To ſavages indeed,
and ſailors on a long voyage, every thing that has life ſeems good to be
eaten; and we often find them recommending thoſe animals as dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which
they themſelves would ſpurn at, after a courſe of good living. Nothing is
more <pb n="369" facs="tcp:0823900105:397"/> common in their journals than ſuch accounts as
theſe—
<q rend="inline">"This day we ſhot a fox—pretty good
eating: this day we ſhot a heron—pretty good eating: and this day we
killed a turtle—which they rank with the heron and the fox, as pretty
good eating."</q> Their accounts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of the fleſh of theſe birds,
are not to be depended upon; and when they cry up the heron or the ſtork of
other countries as luxurious food, we muſt always attend to the ſtate of
their appetites who give the character.</p>
               <p>In treating of this claſs of birds, it will be beſt to
obſerve the ſimpleſt method poſſible; neither to load the memory with
numerous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, nor yet confuſe the imagination, by a total want of
arrangement. I will therefore deſcribe ſome of the larger ſorts
ſeparately; as in an hiſtory of birds, each of theſe demands peculiar
diſtinction. The crane, the ſtork, the Ballearic crane, the heron, the
bittern, with ſome others, may require a ſeparate hiſtory. Some
particular tribes may next offer, that may very naturally be claſſed
together: and as for all the ſmaller and leaſt remarkable ſorts, they may
be grouped into one general deſcription.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. The Crane.</head>
               <p>THERE is ſomething extraordinary in the different accounts we
have of this bird's ſize and dimenſions. Willoughby and Penant make the
Crane from five to ſix feet long, from the tip to the tail. Other accounts
ſay, that it is above five feet high; and others, that it is as tall as a
man. From the many which I myſelf had ſeen, I own this imputed magnitude
ſurprized me; as from memory I was convinced, they could neither be ſo long
nor ſo tall. Indeed, a bird, the body of which is not larger than that of a
turkey-hen, and acknowledged on all hands not to weigh above ten pounds, cannot
eaſily be ſuppoſed to be almoſt as long as an oſtrich. Briſſon,
however, ſeems to give this bird its real dimenſions, when he deſcribes
it as ſomething leſs than the brown ſtork, about three feet high, and
about four from the tip to the tail. Still, however, the numerous
teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of its ſuperior ſize are not to be totally rejected; and
perhaps, that from which Briſſon took his dimenſions, was one of the
ſmalleſt of the kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:0823900105:399"/>The crane, taking its dimenſions from
him, is exactly three feet four inches from the tip to the tail, and four feet
from the head to the toe. It is a tall, ſlender bird, with a long neck and
long legs. The top of the head is covered with black briſtles, and the back
of it is bald and red, which ſufficiently diſtinguiſhes this bird from
the ſtork, to which it is very nearly allied in ſize and figure. The
plumage, in general, is aſh-coloured; and there are two large tufts of
feathers, that ſpring from the pinion of each wing. Theſe bear a
reſemblance to hair, and are finely curled at the ends, which the bird has a
power of erecting and depreſſing at pleaſure. Geſner ſays, that
theſe feathers, in his time, uſed to be ſet in gold, and worn as
ornaments in caps.</p>
               <p>Such are the dimenſions of a bird, concerning which, not to
mention modern times, there have been more fables propagated than of any other.
It is a bird with which all the antient writers are familiar; and, in
deſcribing it, they have not failed to mix imagination with hiſtory. From
the policy of the cranes, they ſay, we are to look for an idea of the moſt
perfect republic amongſt ourſelves; from their tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their
decrepid parents, which they take care to nouriſh, to cheriſh, and
ſupport when <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0823900105:400"/> flying, we are to learn leſſons of
filial piety; but particularly from their conduct in fighting with the pigmies
of Ethiopia, we are to receive our maxims in the art of war. In early times,
the hiſtory of nature fell to the lot of poets only, and certainly none could
deſcribe it ſo well; but it is a part of their province to embelliſh
alſo; and when this agreeable ſcience was claimed by a more ſober claſs
of people, they were obliged to take the accounts of things as they found them;
and, in the preſent inſtance, fable ran down blended with truth to
poſterity.</p>
               <p>In theſe accounts, therefore, there is ſome foundation of
truth; yet much more has been added by fancy. The crane is certainly a very
ſocial bird, and they are ſeldom ſeen alone. Their uſual method of
flying or ſitting, is in flocks of fifty or ſixty together; and while a
part feed, the reſt ſtand like centinels upon duty. The fable of their
ſupporting their aged parents, may have ariſen from their ſtrict
connubial affection; and as for their fighting with the pigmies, it may not be
improbable but that they have boldly withſtood the invaſions of monkies
coming to rob their neſts; for, in this caſe, as the crane lives upon
vegetables, it is not probable that it would be the firſt aggreſſor.</p>
               <p>However this be, the crane is a wandering, <pb n="373" facs="tcp:0823900105:401"/> ſociable bird, that, for the moſt part, ſubſiſts upon
vegetables; and is known in every country of Europe, except our own. There is
no part of the world, ſays Belonius, where the fields are cultivated, that
the crane does not come in with the huſbandman for a ſhare in the
har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. As they are birds of paſſage, they are ſeen to depart and
return regularly at thoſe ſeaſons when their proviſion invites or
repels them. They generally leave Europe about the latter end of autumn, and
return in the beginning of ſummer. In the inland parts of the continent, they
are ſeen croſſing the country, in flocks of fifty or an hundred, making
from the northern regions towards the ſouth. In theſe migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, however,
they are not ſo reſolutely bent upon going forward, but that if a field of
corn offers in their way, they will ſtop a while to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale upon it: on
ſuch occaſions they do incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible damage, chiefly in the night; and the
huſbandman, who lay down in joyful expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, riſes in the morning to
ſee his fields laid entirely waſte, by an enemy, whoſe march is too
ſwift for his vengeance to overtake.</p>
               <p>Our own country is free from their viſits; not but that they
were formerly known in this iſland, and held in great eſtimation, for the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of their fleſh: there was even a penalty <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0823900105:402"/>
upon ſuch as deſtroyed their eggs; but, at preſent, they never go ſo
far out of their way. Cultivation and populouſneſs go hand in hand; and
though our fields may offer them a greater plenty, yet it is ſo guarded, that
the birds find the venture greater than the enjoyment; and probably we are much
better off by their abſence than their company. Whatever their fleſh might
once have been, when, as Plutarch tells us, cranes were blinded and kept in
coops, to be fattened for the tables of the great in Rome; or, as they were
brought up, ſtuffed with mint and rue, to the tables of our nobles at home;
at preſent, they are conſidered all over Europe as wretched eating. The
fleſh is fibrous and dry, requiring much preparation to make it palatable;
and even after every art, it is fit only for the ſtomachs of ſtrong and
labouring people.</p>
               <p>The cold Artic region ſeems to be this bird's favourite abode.
They come down into the more ſouthern parts of Europe, rather as viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
than inhabitants: yet it is not well known in what manner they portion out
their time, to the different parts of the world. The migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the
fieldfare or thruſh, are obvious, and well known; they go northward or
ſouthward, in one ſimple track; when their food fails them here, they have
but one region to go to. But <pb n="375" facs="tcp:0823900105:403"/> it is otherwiſe with the
crane; he changes place, like a wanderer: he ſpends the autumn in Europe; he
then flies off, probably to ſome more ſouthern climate, to enjoy a part of
the winter; returns to Europe in the ſpring; croſſes up to the north in
ſummer; viſits thoſe lakes that are never dry; and then comes down again,
to make depredations upon our cultivated grounds, in autumn. Thus, Geſner
aſſures us, that the cranes uſually began to quit Germany, from about the
eleventh of September to the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of October; from thence they were
ſeen flying ſouthward by thouſands; and Redi tells us, they arrive in
Tuſcany a ſhort time after. There they tear up the fields, newly ſown,
for the grain juſt committed to the ground, and do great miſchief. It is to
be ſuppoſed that, in the ſeverity of winter, they go ſouthward, ſtill
nearer the line. They again appear in the fields of Piſa, regularly about the
twentieth of February, to anticipate the ſpring.</p>
               <p>In theſe journeys it is amazing to conceive the heights to
which they aſcend, when they fly. Their note is the loudeſt of all other
birds; and that is often heard in the clouds, when the bird itſelf is
entirely unſeen. As it is light for its ſize, and ſpreads a large
expanſe of wing, it is capable of floating, at the greateſt height, 
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0823900105:404"/> where the air is lighteſt; and as it ſecures its
ſafety, and is entirely out of the reach of man, it flies in tracts which
would be too fatiguing for any other birds to move forward in.</p>
               <p>In theſe aerial journeys, though unſeen themſelves, they
have the diſtincteſt viſion of every object below. They govern and direct
their flight by their cries; and exhort each other to proceed or to deſcend,
when a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offers for depredation. Their voice, as was obſerved,
is the loudeſt of all the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered tribe; and its peculiar clangor ariſes
from the very extraordinary length and contortion of the windpipe. In
quadrupedes, the windpipe is ſhort, and the glottis, or cartilages that form
the voice, are at that end of it which is next the mouth: in water fowl the
windpipe is longer, but the cartilages that form the voice are at the other
end, which lies down in their belly. By this means they have much louder
voices, in proportion to their ſize, than any other animals whatever; for the
note, when formed below, is reverberated through all the rings of the windpipe,
till it reaches the air. But the voice of the duck or the gooſe, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be compared to that of the crane, whoſe windpipe is not only made in the
ſame manner with theirs, but is above twenty times <pb n="377" facs="tcp:0823900105:405"/> as
long. Nature ſeems to have beſtowed much pains in lengthening out this
organ. From the outſide, it enters through the fleſh into the
breaſt-bone, which hath a great cavity within to receive it. There, being
thrice reflected, it goes out again at the ſame hole, and ſo turns down to
the lungs, and thus enters the body a ſecond time. The loud clangorous
ſound which the bird is thus enabled to produce, is, when near, almoſt
deafening: however, it is particularly ſerviceable to the animal itſelf,
ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther during its migrations or its ſtay: by it the flock is encouraged in
their journies; and if, while they are feeding, which is uſually performed in
profound ſilence, they are invaded on any ſide, the bird that firſt
perceives the danger, is ſure to ſound the alarm, and all are ſpeedily
upon the wing.</p>
               <p>As they riſe but heavily, they are very ſhy birds, and
ſeldom let the fowler approach them. Their depredations are uſually made in
the darkeſt nights; at which time they enter a field of corn, and trample it
down, as if it had been croſſed over by a regiment of men. On other
occaſions, they chuſe ſome extenſive ſolitary marſh, where they
range themſelves all day, as if they were in deliberation; and not having 
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0823900105:406"/> that grain which is moſt to their appetites, wade the
marſhes, for inſects, and other food, which they can procure with leſs
danger.</p>
               <p>Corn is their favourite food; but there is ſcarce any other
that comes amiſs to them. Redi, who opened ſeveral, found the ſtomach of
one full of the herb called dandelion; that of another was filled with beans; a
third had a great quantity of clover in its ſtomach; while that of two others
was filled with earth-worms and beetles: in ſome he found lizards and
ſea-fiſh; in others, ſnails, graſs, and pebbles, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed perhaps
for medicinal purpoſes. It ſeems, therefore, that theſe birds are
eaſily ſupplied; and that they are noxious to corn-fields but on ſome
particular occaſions.</p>
               <p>In general it is a peaceful bird, both in its own ſociety, and
with reſpect to thoſe of the foreſt. Though ſo large in appearance, a
little falcon purſues, and often diſables it. The method is, with thoſe
who are fond of hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to fly ſeveral hawks together againſt it; which
the crane endeavours to avoid, by flying up perpendicularly, till the air
becomes too thin to ſupport it any higher. The hawk, however, ſtill bears
it company; and though leſs fitted for floating in ſo thin a medium, yet, 
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0823900105:407"/> poſſeſſed of greater rapidity, it ſtill gains
the aſcendency. They both often riſe out of ſight; but ſoon the
ſpectator, who keeps his eye fixed above, perceives them, like two ſpecks,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to appear: they gather on his eye for a little ſpace, and
ſhortly after come tumbling per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly together, with great animoſity
on the ſide of the hawk, and a loud ſcreaming on that of the crane. Thus
driven to extremity, and unable to fly, the poor animal throws itſelf upon
its back, and, in that ſituation, makes a moſt deſperate defence, till
the ſportſman coming up, generally puts an end to the conteſt with its
life.</p>
               <p>It was once the barbarous cuſtom to breed up cranes to be thus
baited; and young ones were taken from the neſt, to be trained up for this
cruel diverſion. It is an animal eaſily tamed; and, if we can believe
Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, has a particular affection for man. This quality, however,
was not ſufficient to guard it from being made the victim of his fierce
amuſements. The female, which is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the male, by
not being bald behind as he is, never lays above two eggs at a time; being like
thoſe of a gooſe, but of a bluiſh colour. The young ones are ſoon fit
to <pb n="380" facs="tcp:0823900105:408"/> fly, and then the parents forſake them to ſhift
for themſelves; but, before this time, they are led forth to the places where
their food is moſt eaſily found. Though yet unfledged, they run with ſuch
ſwiftneſs that a man cannot eaſily overtake them. We are told, that as
they grow old, their plumage becomes darker; and, as a proof of their
longevity, Aldrovandus aſſures us, that a friend of his kept one tame for
above forty years.</p>
               <p>Whatever may have been the diſpoſition of the great, the
vulgar of every country, to this day, bear the crane a compaſſionate
regard. It is poſſible the antient prejudices in its favour, which once
having been planted, are eradicated but ſlowly, may ſtill continue to
operate. In ſome countries, it is conſidered as an heinous offence to kill
a crane; and though the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declines to puniſh, yet the people do
not fail to reſent, the injury. The crane, they, in ſome meaſure,
conſider as the prophet of the ſeaſon: upon its approach or delay they
regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the periods of their rural oeconomy. If their favourite bird comes
early in the ſeaſon, they expect a plentiful ſummer; if he is ſlow in
his viſits, they then prepare for an unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſpring. Whatever
wiſdom there may <pb n="381" facs="tcp:0823900105:409"/> be in deſpiſing the prejudices of
the vulgar, there is but little in condemning them. They have generally had
their origin in good motives; and it ſhould never be our endeavours to
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs any tender emotions of friendſhip or pity, in thoſe hard
breaſts that are, in general, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſceptible of either.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. The Stork.</head>
               <p>IF we regard the Stork externally only, we ſhall be very apt
to confound it with the crane. It is of the ſame ſize; it has the ſame
formation as to the bill, neck, legs, and body, except that it is ſomething
more corpulent. Its differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are but very ſlight; ſuch as the colour,
which in the crane is aſh and black, but in the ſtork is white and brown.
The nails of the toes of the ſtork alſo are very peculiar; not being clawed
like thoſe of other birds, but flat like the nails of a man.</p>
               <p>Theſe, however, are but very ſlight differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and its
true diſtinctions are to be taken rather from its manners than its form. The
crane has a loud piercing voice; the ſtork is ſilent, and produces no other
noiſe than the clacking of its under chap againſt the upper: the crane has
a ſtrange convolution of the wind-pipe through the breaſt-bone; the
ſtork's is formed in the uſual manner: the crane feeds moſtly upon
vegetables and grain; the ſtork preys entirely upon frogs, fiſhes, birds,
and ſerpents: the crane avoids towns and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous <pb n="383" facs="tcp:0823900105:411"/>
places; the ſtork lives always in or near them: the crane lays but two eggs,
and the ſtork generally four. Theſe are diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fully ſufficient
to mark the ſpecies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſimilitude of their form.</p>
               <p>Storks are birds of paſſage, like the former; but it is hard
to ſay whence they come or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go. When they withdraw from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
they all aſſemble on a particular day, and never leave one of their company
behind them. They take their flight in the night; which is the reaſon the way
they go has never been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. They generally return into Europe in the
middle of March, and make their neſts on the tops of chimnies and houſes as
well as of high trees. The females lay from two to four eggs, of the ſize and
colour of thoſe of geeſe; and the male and female ſit upon them by turns.
They are a month in hatching; and when their young are excluded, they are
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſolicitous for their ſafety.</p>
               <p>As the food of theſe birds conſiſts in a great meaſure
of frogs and ſerpents, it is not to be wondered at that different nations
have paid them a particular veneration. The Dutch are very ſolicitous for the
preſervation of the ſtork in every part of their republic. This bird
ſeems to have taken refuge among their towns; and <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0823900105:412"/>
builds on the tops of their houſes without any moleſtation. There it is
ſeen reſting familiarly in their ſtreets, and protected as well by the
laws as the prejudices of the people. They have even got an opinion that it
will only live in a republic; and that ſtory of its filial piety, firſt
falſely propagated of the crane, has in part been aſcribed to the ſtork.
But it is not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics alone that the ſtork is ſeen to reſide, as
there are few towns on the continent, in low marſhy ſituations, but have
the ſtork as an inmate among them; as well the deſpotic princes of Germany
as the little republics of Italy.</p>
               <p>The ſtork ſeems a general favourite even among the moderns;
but with the antient Egyptians their regard was carried even to ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
This enlightened people, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Deity in his creatures, paid
divine honours to the ibis, as is univerſally known. It has been uſually
ſuppoſed that the antient ibis is the ſame with that which goes at
preſent by the ſame name; a bird of the ſtork kind, of about the ſize
of a curlew, all over black, with a bill very thick in the beginning, but
ending in a point for the better ſeizing its prey, which is caterpillars,
locuſts, and ſerpents. But, however uſeful the modern ibis may be in
ridding Egypt, where it reſides, of the vermin <pb n="385" facs="tcp:0823900105:413"/> and
venemous animals that infeſt it; yet it is much doubted whether this be the
ſame ibis to which the ancients paid their adoration. Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, the French
conſul at Cairo, obſerves, that it is very hard to determine what bird the
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ibis certainly was, becauſe there are cranes, ſtorks, hawks,
kites, and falcons, that are all equally enemies to ſerpents, and devour a
vaſt number. He farther adds, that in the months of May, when the winds begin
to blow from the internal parts of Africa, there are ſeveral ſorts of birds
that come down from Upper Egypt, from whence they are driven by the rains, in
ſearch of a better habitation, and that it is then they do this country
ſuch ſignal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. Nor does the figure of this bird hierogli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically
repreſented on their pillars mark it ſufficiently to make the
diſtinction. Beſides, the modern ibis is not peculiar to Egypt, as it is to
be ſeen but at certain ſeaſons of the year; whereas we are informed by
Pliny, that this bird was ſeen no where elſe. It is thought, therefore,
that the true ibis is a bird of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture kind, deſcribed above, and
called by ſome the capon of Pharaoh, which not only is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of
ſerpents, but will follow the caravans that go to Mecca, to feed upon the
offal of the animals that are killed on the journey.</p>

               <p>HAVING ended the laſt chapter with doubts concerning the ibis,
we ſhall begin this with doubts concerning the Balearic Crane. Pliny has
deſcribed a bird of the crane-kind with a topping reſembling that of the
green wood-pecker. This bird for a long time continued unknown till we became
acquainted with the birds of tropical climates, when one of the crane-kind with
a topping was brought into Europe, and deſcribed by Aldrovandus as Pliny's
Balearic Crane. Hence theſe birds, which have ſince been brought from
Africa and the Eaſt in numbers, have received the name of Balearic Cranes,
but without any juſt foundation. The real Balearic Crane of Pliny ſeems to
be the leſſer aſh-coloured heron, with a topping of narrow white
feathers, or perhaps the egret, with two long feathers that fall back from the
ſides of the head. The bird that we are about to deſcribe under the name of
the Balearic Crane was unknown to the ancients; and the heron or egret ought to
be reinſtated in their juſt title to that name.</p>

                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:0823900105:418"/>When we ſee a very extraordinary animal,
we are naturally led to ſuppoſe that there muſt be ſomething alſo
remarkable in its hiſtory to correſpond with the ſingularity of its
figure. But it often happens that hiſtory fails on thoſe occaſions where
we moſt deſire informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the preſent inſtance, in particular, no
bird preſents to the eye a more whimſical figure than this, which we muſt
be content to call the Balearic Crane. It is pretty nearly of the ſhape and
ſize of the ordinary crane, with long legs and a long neck, like others of
the kind; but the bill is ſhorter, and the colour of the feathers of a dark
greeniſh grey. The head and throat form the moſt ſtriking part of this
bird's figure. On the head is ſeen ſtanding up, a thick round creſt, made
of briſtles, ſpreading every way, and reſembling rays ſtanding out in
different directions. The longeſt of theſe rays are about three inches and
an half; and they are all topped with a kind of black taſſels, which give
them a beautiful appearance. The ſides of the head and cheeks are bare,
whitiſh, and edged with red, while underneath the throat hangs a kind of bag
or wattle, like that of a cock, but not divided into two. To give this odd
compoſition a higher finiſhing, the eye is large and ſtaring; the pupil
black and big, <pb n="388" facs="tcp:0823900105:419"/> ſurrounded with a gold-coloured iris
that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes the bird's very ſingular appearance.</p>
               <p>From ſuch a peculiar figure, we might be led to wiſh for a
minute hiſtory of its manners; but of theſe we can give but ſlight
information. This bird comes from the coaſt of Africa and the Cape de Verd
Iſlands. As it runs, it ſtretches out its wings, and goes very ſwiftly,
otherwiſe its uſual motion is very ſlow. In their domeſtic ſtate,
they walk very deliberately among other poultry, and ſuffer themſelves to
be approached (at leaſt it was ſo with that I ſaw) by every ſpectator.
They never rooſt in houſes but about night: when they are diſpoſed to
go to reſt, they ſearch out ſome high wall, on which they pearch in the
manner of a peacock. Indeed, they ſo much reſemble that bird in manners and
diſpoſition, that ſome have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them by the name of the
ſea-peacock; and Ray has been inclined to rank them in the ſame family.
But, though their voice and rooſting be ſimilar, their food, which is
entirely upon greens, vegetables, and barley, ſeems to make ſome
difference.</p>
               <p>In this chapter of foreign birds of the crane-kind, it will be
proper to mention the Jabiru and the Jabiru Guacu, both natives of Braſil. Of
theſe great birds of the crane-kind we know <pb n="389" facs="tcp:0823900105:420"/> but
little, except the general out-line of their figure, and the enormous bills
which we often ſee preſerved in the cabinets of the curious. The bill of
the latter is red, and thirteen inches long; the bill of the former is black,
and is found to be eleven. Neither of them, however, are of a ſize
proportioned to their immoderate length of bill. The jabiru guacu is not above
the ſize of a common ſtork, while the jabiru with the ſmalleſt bill
exceeds the ſize of a ſwan. They are both covered with white feathers,
except the head and neck that are naked; and their principal difference is in
the ſize of the body and the make of the bill; the lower chap of the jabiru
guacu being broad, and bending upwards.</p>
               <p>A bird ſtill more extraordinary may be added to this claſs,
called the Anhima, and, like the the two former, a native of Braſil. This is
a water-fowl of the rapacious kind, and bigger than a ſwan. The head, which
is ſmall for the ſize of the body, bears a black bill, which is not above
two inches long; but what diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes it in particular is a horn growing
from the forehead as long as the bill, and bending forward like that of the
fabulous unicorn of the ancients. This horn is not much thicker than a
crow-quill, as round as if it were turned <pb n="390" facs="tcp:0823900105:421"/> in a lathe,
and of an ivory colour. But this is not the only inſtrument of battle this
formidable bird carries; it ſeems to be armed at all points; for at the
fore-part of each wing, at the ſecond joint, ſpring two ſtraight
triangular ſpurs, about as thick as ones little finger: the foremoſt of
theſe goads or ſpurs is above an inch long; the hinder is ſhorter, and
both of a duſky colour. The claws alſo are long and ſharp; the colour is
black and white; and they cry terribly loud, ſounding ſomething like Vyhoo
Vyhoo. They are never found alone, but always in pairs; the cock and hen prowl
together; and their fidelity is ſaid to be ſuch, that when one dies, the
other never departs from the carcaſe, but dies with its companion. It makes
its neſt of clay, near the bodies of trees, upon the ground, of the ſhape
of an oven.</p>
               <p>One bird more may be ſubjoined to this claſs, not for the
oddity of its figure, but the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity of its manners. It is vulgarly
called by our ſailors the Buffoon Bird, and by the French the Demoiſelle,
or Lady. The ſame qualities have procured it theſe different appellations
from two nations who, on more occaſions than this, look upon the ſame
objects in very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lights. The peculiar geſtures and contor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
this bird, the proper name of which is the Numidian Crane, are extremely
ſingular; <pb n="391" facs="tcp:0823900105:422"/> and the French, who are ſkilled in the
arts of elegant geſticulation, conſider all its motions as lady-like and
graceful. Our Engliſh ſailors however, who have not entered ſo deeply
into the dancing art, think, that while thus in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the bird cuts but a
very ridiculous figure. It ſtoops, riſes, lifts one wing, then another,
turns round, ſails forward, then back again; all which highly diverts our
ſeamen; not imagining, perhaps, that all theſe contortions are but the
aukward expreſſion not of the poor animal's pleaſures but its fears.</p>
               <p>It is a very ſcarce bird; the plumage is of a leaden grey; but
it is diſtinguiſhed by fine white feathers, conſiſting of long fibres,
which fall from the back of the head, about four inches long; while the
fore-part of the neck is adorned with black feathers, compoſed of very fine,
ſoft, and long fibres, that hang down upon the ſtomach, and give the bird a
very graceful appearance. The ancients have deſcribed a buffoon bird, but
there are many reaſons to believe that theirs is not the Numidian crane. It
comes from that country from whence it has taken its name.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the Heron and its Varieties.</head>
               <p>BIRDS of the crane, the ſtork, and the heron kind, bear a very
ſtrong affinity to each other; and their differences are not eaſily
diſcernible. As for the crane and the ſtork, they differ rather in their
nature and internal conformation than in their external figure; but ſtill,
they may be known aſunder, as well by their colour as by the ſtork's claws,
which are very peculiar, and more reſembling a man's nails than the claws of
a bird. The heron may be diſtinguiſhed from both, as well by its ſize,
which is much leſs, as by its bill, which in proportion is much longer; but
particularly by the middle claw on each foot, which is toothed like a ſaw,
for the better ſeizing and holding its ſlippery prey. Should other marks
fail, however, there is an anatomical diſtinction, in which herons differ
from all other birds; which is, that they have but one coecum, and all other
birds have two.</p>
               <p>Of this tribe, Briſon has enumerated not leſs than
forty-ſeven ſorts, all differing in their ſize, figure, and plumage; and
with talents adapted to their place of reſidence, or their peculiar 
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0823900105:424"/> purſuits. But, how various ſoever the heron kind may
be in their colours or their bills, they all ſeem poſſeſſed of the
ſame manners, and have but one character of cowardice and rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
indolence, yet inſatiable hunger. Other birds are found to grow fat by an
abundant ſupply of food; but theſe, though exceſſively deſtructive
and voracious, are ever found to have lean and carrion bodies, as if not even
plenty were ſufficient for their ſupport.</p>
               <p>The common heron is remarkably light, in proportion to its bulk,
ſcarce weighing three pounds and an half, yet it expands a breadth of wing
which is five feet from tip to tip. Its bill is very long, being five inches
from the point to the baſe; its claws are long, ſharp, and the middlemoſt
toothed like a ſaw. Yet, thus armed as it appears for war, it is indolent and
cowardly, and even flies at the approach of a ſparrow-hawk. It was once the
amuſement of the great to purſue this timorous creature with the falcon;
and heron-hawking was ſo favourite a diverſion among our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, that
laws were enacted for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſpecies; and the perſon
who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed their eggs was liable to a penalty of twenty ſhillings for
each offence.</p>
               <p>At preſent, however, the defects of the ill-judged 
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0823900105:425"/> policy of our anceſtors is felt by their poſterity;
for, as the amuſement of hawking has given place to the more uſeful method
of ſtocking fiſh-ponds, the heron is now become a moſt formidable enemy.
Of all other birds, this commits the greateſt devaſtation in
freſh-waters; and there is ſcarce a fiſh, though never ſo large, that
he will not ſtrike at and wound, though unable to carry it away. But the
ſmaller fry are his chief ſubſiſtence; theſe, purſued by their
larger fellows of the deep, are obliged to take refuge in ſhallow waters,
where they find the heron a ſtill more formidable enemy. His method is to
wade as far as he can go into the water, and there patiently wait the approach
of his prey, which when it comes within ſight, he darts upon it with
inevitable aim. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he is found to deſtroy more in a week than an
otter in three months. 
<q rend="inline">"I have ſeen an heron," ſays Willoughby,
"that had been ſhot, that had ſeventeen carps in his belly at once, which
he will digeſt in ſix or ſeven hours, and then to fiſhing again. I have
ſeen a carp," continues he, "taken out of a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's belly, nine inches and
an half long. Several gentlemen who kept tame herons, to try what quantity one
of them would eat in a day, have put ſeveral ſmaller roach and 
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0823900105:426"/> dace in a tub; and they have found him eat fifty in a
day, one day with another. In this manner a ſingle heron will deſtroy
fifteen thouſand carp in a ſingle half year."</q>
               </p>
               <p>So great are the digeſtive powers of this freſh-water
tyrant, and ſo detrimental to thoſe who ſtock ponds with fiſh. In
general, he is ſeen taking his gloomy ſtand by the lake ſide, as if
meditating miſchief, motionleſs and gorged with plunder. His uſual
attitude on this occaſion is to ſink his long neck between his ſhoulders,
and keep his head turned on one ſide, as if eyeing the pool more intently.
When the call of hunger returns, the toil of an hour or two is generally
ſufficient to fill his capacious ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and he retires long before night
to his retreat in the woods. Early in the morning, however, he is ſeen
aſſiduous at his uſual occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>But, though in ſeaſons of fine weather the heron can always
find a plentiful ſupply; in cold or ſtormy ſeaſons, his prey is no
longer within reach: the fiſh that before came into the ſhallow water now
keep in the deep, as they find it to be the warmeſt ſituation. Frogs and
lizards alſo ſeldom venture from their lurking places; and the heron is
obliged to ſupport himſelf upon his long habits of patience, and even to
take up with the weeds that grow upon <pb n="396" facs="tcp:0823900105:427"/> the water. At
thoſe times he contracts a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive diſpoſition, which ſucceeding
plenty is not able to remove; ſo that the meagre glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſpends his time
between want and riot, and feels alternately the extremes of famine and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Hence, notwithſtanding the care with which he takes his prey, and
the amazing quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity he devours, the heron is always lean and emaciated; and
though his crop be uſually found full, yet his fleſh is ſcarce
ſufficient to cover the bones.</p>
               <p>The heron uſually takes his prey by wading into the water, yet
it muſt not be ſuppoſed that he does not alſo take it upon the wing. In
fact, much of his fiſhing is performed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but he never hovers
over deep waters, as there his prey is enabled to eſcape him by ſinking to
the bottom. In ſhallow places he darts with more certainty; for though the
fiſh at ſight of its enemy inſtantly deſcends, yet the heron, with his
long bill and legs, inſtantly pins it to the bottom, and thus ſeizes it
ſecurely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> In this manner, after
having been ſeen with its long neck for above a minute under water, he
riſes upon the wing, with a trout or an eel ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in his bill to get
free. The greedy bird, however, flies to the ſhore, ſcarce gives it time to
expire, but ſwallows it whole, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to fiſhing as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:0823900105:428"/>As this bird does incredible miſchief to
ponds newly ſtocked, Willoughby has given a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt for taking him. 
<q rend="inline">"Having found his haunt, get three or four
ſmall roach or dace, and having provided a ſtrong hook with a wire to it,
this is drawn juſt within ſide the ſkin of the fiſh, beginning without
ſide the gills and running it to the tail, by which the fiſh will not be
killed, but continue for five or ſix days alive. Then having a ſtrong line
made of ſilk and wire, about two yards and an half long, it is tied to a
ſtone at one end, the fiſh with the hook being ſuffered to ſwim about
at the other. This being properly diſpoſed in ſhallow water, the heron
will ſeize upon the fiſh to its own deſtruction. From this method we may
learn, that the fiſh muſt be alive, otherwiſe the heron will not touch
them, and that this bird, as well as all thoſe that feed upon fiſh, muſt
be its own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer; for they will not prey upon ſuch as die naturally, or
are killed by others before them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though this bird lives chiefly among pools and marſhes, yet
its neſt is built on the tops of the higheſt trees, and ſometimes on
cliffs hanging over the ſea. They are never in flocks when they fiſh,
committing their depredations in ſolitude and ſilence; but in making their 
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0823900105:429"/> neſts they love each others ſociety; and they are
ſeen, like rooks, building in company with flocks of their kind. Their
neſts are made of ſticks and lined with wool; and the female lays four
large eggs of a pale green colour. The obſervable indolence of their nature,
however, is not leſs ſeen in their neſtling than in their habits of
depredation. Nothing is more certain, and I have ſeen it an hundred times,
than that they will not be at the trouble of building a neſt when they can
get one made by the rook, or deſerted by the owl, already provided for them.
This they uſually enlarge and line within, driving off the original
poſſeſſors ſhould they happen to renew their fruitleſs claims.</p>
               <p>The French ſeem to have availed themſelves of the indolence
of this bird in making its neſt; and they actually provide a place with
materials fitted for their neſtling, which they call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronries. The heron,
which with us is totally unfit for the table, is more ſought for in France,
where the fleſh of the young ones is in particular eſtimation. To obtain
this, the natives raiſe up high ſheds along ſome fiſhy ſtream; and
furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with materials for the herons to neſtle with, theſe
birds build and breed there in great abundance. As ſoon as the young ones are
ſuppoſed to be fit, the owner of the heronry comes, as we do into a
pigeon-houſe, and carries <pb n="399" facs="tcp:0823900105:430"/> off ſuch as are proper for
eating; and theſe are ſold for a very good price to the neighbouring
gentry. 
<q rend="inline">"Theſe are a delicacy which," as my author
ſays, "the French are very fond of, but which ſtrangers have not yet been
taught to reliſh as they ought."</q> Nevertheleſs it was formerly much
eſteemed as a food in England, and made a favourite diſh at great tables.
It was then ſaid that the fleſh of a heron was a diſh for a king; at
preſent, nothing about the houſe will touch it but a cat.</p>
               <p>With us, therefore, as the heron, both old and young, is thought
deteſtable eating, we ſeldom trouble theſe animals in their heights,
which are for the moſt part ſufficiently inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Their neſts
are often found in great numbers in the middle of large foreſts, and in
ſome groves nearer home, where the owners have a predilection for the bird,
and do not chuſe to drive it from its accuſtomed habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is
certain that by their cries, their expanſive wings, their bulk, and wavy
motion, they add no ſmall ſolemnity to the foreſt, and give a pleaſing
variety to a finiſhed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
               <p>When the young are excluded, as they are numerous, voracious,
and importunate, the old ones are for ever upon the wing to provide them with
abundance. The quantity of fiſh they <pb n="400" facs="tcp:0823900105:431"/> take upon this
occaſion is amazing, and their ſize is not leſs to be wondered at. I
remember a heron's neſt that was built near a ſchool-houſe; the boys,
with their uſual appetite for miſchief, climbed up, took down the young
ones, ſewed up the vent, and laid them in the neſt as before. The pain the
poor little animals felt from the operation encreaſed their cries; and this
but ſerved to encreaſe the diligence of the old ones in enlarging their
ſupply. Thus they heaped the neſt with various ſorts of fiſh and the
beſt of their kind; and as their young ſcreamed they flew off for more. The
boys gathered up the fiſh, which the young ones were incapable of eating,
till the old ones at laſt quitted their neſt, and gave up their brood,
whoſe appetites they found it impoſſible to ſatisfy.</p>
               <p>The heron is ſaid to be a very long-lived bird; by Mr.
Keyſler's account it may exceed ſixty years; and by a recent inſtance of
one that was taken in Holland, by an hawk belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtadtholder, its
longevity is again confirmed, the bird having a ſilver plate faſtened to
one leg, with an inſcription, importing that it had been ſtruck by the
elector of Cologne's hawks thirty-five years before.</p>
