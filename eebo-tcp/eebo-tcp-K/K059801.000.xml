            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The moſt Flouriſhing
CITY in the Univerſe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Man who has the Publick Good
in View, ought not in the leaſt to
be alarm'd at the tribute of Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule
which Scoffers conſtantly
pay to projecting Heads: It is the Buſineſs
of a Writer, who means well, to go direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forward, without regard to Criticiſm,
but to offer his Thoughts as they occur; and
if in twenty Schemes, he hits but on one to
the Purpoſe, he ought to be excuſed fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Nineteen for the Twentieth
Sake. 'Tis a kind of good Action to
mean well, and the Intention ought to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
the Failure, but the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> of all
People in the World, ſhow leaſt Mercy to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0316800100:3"/>
Schemiſts, for they treat them in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
manner; whereas other Nations give
them fair Play for their Lives, which is
the reaſon why we are eſteem'd ſo bad at
Invention.</p>
            <p>I have but a ſhort Time to live, nor
would I waſte my remaining Thread of
Life in Vain, but having often lamented
ſundry Publick Abuſes, and many Schemes
having occur'd to my Fancy, which to me
carried an Air of Benefit; I was reſolv'd to
commit them to Paper before my Departure,
and leave, at leaſt, a Teſtimony of my good
Will to my Fellow Creatures.</p>
            <p>But of all my Reflections, none was more
conſtantly my Companion than a deep Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for the preſent decay of Learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, and the manifeſt Corruption of
Education; we have been a brave and learned
People, and are inſenſibly dwindling into
an Effeminate, Superficial Race: Our young
Gentlemen are ſent to the Univerſities 'tis
true, but not under Reſtraint or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
as formerly; not to ſtudy, but to
drink; not for Furniture for the Head, but
a Feather for the Cap, merely to ſay they
have been at <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as if
the Air of thoſe Places inſpir'd Knowledge
without Application. 'Tis true, we ought
to have thoſe Places in Reverence for the
many learned Men they have ſent us; but
why muſt we go ſo far for Knowledge?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0316800100:4"/>
why ſhould a young Gentleman be ſent raw
from the Nurſery to live on his own Hands,
to be liable to a thouſand Temptations, and
run the Riſque of being ſnapt up by ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Jilts, with which both Univerſities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
who make our Youth of Fortune
their Prey, and have brought Miſery into
too many good Families? Not only the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of their Healths from Debauches of
both Kinds, but the waſte of their precious
Time renders the ſending them ſo far off
very hazardous. Why ſhould ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis
as <hi>London</hi> be without an Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Would it not ſave conſiderably the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
we are at in ſending our young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
ſo far from <hi>London?</hi> Would it not
add to the Luſtre of our State, and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Politeneſs among us? What Benefits
may we not in time expect from ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Deſign? Will not <hi>London</hi> become
the Scene of Science? And what reaſon have
we but to hope we may vye with any Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations? Not that I would have
<hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge</hi> neglected, for the
Good they have done: Beſides, there are
too many fine Endowments to be ſunk, we
may have Univerſities at thoſe Places, and
at <hi>London</hi> too, without Prejudice. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
will never hurt us, and whoever lives
to ſee an Univerſity here, will find it give
quite another turn to the Genius and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of our Youth in general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0316800100:5"/>
How many Gentlemen paſs their Lives in
a ſhameful Indolence, who might employ
themſelves to the purpoſe, were ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
ſet on foot? Learning would flouriſh,
Art revive, and not only thoſe who ſtudy'd
would benefit by it; but the Bleſſing would
be convey'd to others by Converſation.</p>
            <p>And in order to this ſo laudable deſign,
ſmall Expence is required: The ſole Charge
being the hire of a convenient Hall or
Houſe, which if they pleaſe, they may call
a College. But I ſee no neceſſity the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils
have to lye or diet there; that may be
done more reaſonably and conveniently at
home, under the Eye of their Friends:
Their only neceſſary Buſineſs at College be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to attend their Tutors at ſtated Hours,
and (Bed and Board excepted) to conform
themſelves to College Laws, and perform
the ſame Exerciſes as if they were actually
at <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the beſt of Tutors be provided, and
Profeſſors in all Faculties encouraged, this
will do a double good, not only to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
but to the Inſtructors. What a
fine Proviſion may here be made for Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of ingenious Gentlemen, now unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd?
And to what a heighth may even a
ſmall Beginning grow in time?</p>
            <p>As <hi>London</hi> is ſo extenſive, ſo its Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
may be compos'd of many Colleges,
quarter'd at convenient Diſtances; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0316800100:6"/>
one at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> one at St.
<hi>James</hi>'s, one near <hi>Ormond Street;</hi> (that
part of the Town abounding in Gentry)
one in the Centre of the Inns of Court;
another near the <hi>Royal-Exchange;</hi> and
more if Occaſion and Encouragement
permit.</p>
            <p>The ſame Offices and Regulations may
be conſtituted, Cooks, Butlers, Bed-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> excepted, as at other Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
As for Endowment, there is no need,
the whole may be done by Subſcription;
and that an eaſy one; conſidering nothing
but Inſtructions are paid for.</p>
            <p>In a Word, an Academical Education
is ſo much wanted in <hi>London,</hi> that every
Body of Ability and Figure, will readily
come into it; and I dare engage the Place
need but be choſen, and Tutors appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of, to compleat the Deſign at once.</p>
            <p>It may be objected that there is a kind
of Univerſity at <hi>Greſham-College,</hi> where
Profeſſors in all Sciences are maintained and
obliged to read Lectures every Day, or at
leaſt as often as demanded. The Deſign is
moſt laudable, but it ſmells too much of
the <hi>Sine Cure;</hi> they only read in Term-Time,
and then their Lectures are ſo hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
over, the Audience is little the better.
They cannot be turn'd out; 'tis a good Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
for Life, and they are very eaſy in
their Studies when once fix'd. Whereas
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0316800100:7"/>
were the Profeſſorſhip, during good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
there would be a Study to maintain
their Poſts, and their Pupils would reap
the Benefit.</p>
            <p>Upon ſecond Thought, I think Colleges
for Univerſity Education, might be formed
at <hi>Weſtminſter, Eaton,</hi> the <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi>
St. <hi>Pauls, Merchant-Taylors,</hi> and other
Publick Schools, where Youth might begin
and end their Studies; but this may be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſider'd of.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot the moſt material
Point, which is, that his Majeſty's Sanction
muſt firſt be obtain'd, and the Univerſity
propos'd have Power to confer Degrees,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other Academical Priviledges.</p>
            <p>As I am quick to conceive, I am eager
to have done, unwilling to overwork a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
I had rather leave part to the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Readers, than to tire them or
my Self with protracting a Theme; as if
like a Chancery Man, or a Hackney Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
I wrote by the Sheet for hire: So
let us have done with this Topick, and
proceed to another; which is,</p>

               <p>IT is needleſs to run into a Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on this Head, ſince not a Seſſions
paſſes, but we ſee one or more mercileſs
Mothers try'd for the Murder of their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-Children;
and to the Shame of good
Government, generally eſcape the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
due to ſhedders of Innocent Blood:
For 'tis a common Practice now among
them, to hire a ſet of Old-Bedlams, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Midwives, who make it their Trade
to bring them off for three or four Guineas,
having got the ready rote of ſwearing the
Child was not at its full Growth, for which
they have a hidden Reſerve, that is to ſay,
the Child was not at Man's or Woman's
Growth. Thus do theſe impious Wretches
cheat the World, and damn their own Souls
by a double Meaning, which too often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
on a cautious, merciful and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Jury, and gives wicked Murderers
means to eſcape and commit freſh Sins,
to which their Acquitters no doubt are
acceſſary.</p>
               <p>I wonder ſo many Men of Senſe, as have
been on the Jury, have been ſo often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0316800100:9"/>
upon by the ſtale Pretence of a Scrap
or two of Child-Bed Linnen being found
in the Murderer's Box, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when alas!
perhaps it was ne'er put there till after the
Murder was committed; or if it was, but
with a view of ſaving themſelves by that
deviliſh Precaution; for ſo many have been
acquitted on that Pretence, that 'tis but too
common a Thing to provide Child-Bed-Linnen
before-hand for a poor Innocent
Babe they are determin'd to murder.</p>
               <p>But alas! What are the exploded Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to thoſe which eſcape the Eye of the
Magiſtrate, and dye in Silence? Add to
this procur'd Abortions, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
means, which wicked Wretchesmake
uſe off to ſcreen themſelves from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the World, which they dread more
than the Diſpleaſure of their Maker.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who cannot be ſo hard-hearted
to murder their own Offspring themſelves,
take a ſlower, tho' as ſure a way, and get
it done by others, by dropping their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and leaving them to be ſtarved by
Pariſh-Nurſes.</p>
               <p>Thus is God robb'd of a Creature, in
whom he had breath'd the Breath of Life,
and on whom he had ſtamp'd his Image;
the World of an Inhabitant, who might
have been of uſe; the King of a Subject;
and future Generations of an Iſſue not to be
accounted for, had this Infant lived to have
been a Parent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0316800100:10"/>
It is therefore the height of Charity and
Humanity, to provide againſt this Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to prevent this crying Sin, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
Good, even out of Evil, by ſaving
theſe Innocent Babes from Slaughter, and
bringing them up in the Nurture and Fear
of the Lord; to be of Benefit to themſelves
and Mankind in General.</p>
               <p>And what nearer, what better way can
we have, than to erect and endow a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Hoſpital or Houſe to receive them,
where we may ſee them tenderly brought
up, as ſo many living Monuments of our

Murder prevented?</p>
               <p>Nor will this be attended with ſo much
Charge as is imagin'd, for we find in many
Pariſhes, that Parents have re-demanded
their Children, on encreaſe of Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and paid all Coſts with a handſome
Preſent in the Bargain; and many Times
when a Clandeſtine Marriage is clear'd up,
and openly avow'd, they would purchaſe
the Firſt-Fruits of their Loves at any Rate:
Oftentimes a Couple may have no more
Children, and an Infant thus ſav'd, may
arrive to inherit a good Eſtate, and become
a Benefactor, where it was once an Object
of Charity.</p>
               <p>But let us ſuppoſe the worſt, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the Infant begot in Sin and without
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0316800100:11"/>
the Sanction of Wedlock; is it therefore to
be murder'd, ſtarv'd or neglected, becauſe
its Parents were wicked? hard Fate of
innocent Children, to ſuffer for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
Faults! Where God has thought fit
to give his Image and Life, there is Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
demanded; that calls aloud for
our Chriſtian and Human Aſſiſtance, and
beſt ſhows our Nobleneſs of Soul, when we
generouſly aſſiſt thoſe who cannot help
themſelves.</p>
               <p>If the Fault devolv'd on the Children,
our Church would deny them Baptiſm,
Burial, and other Chriſtian Rites; but our
Religion carries more Charity with it, they
are not deny'd even to partake of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Sacraments, and are excluded no
one Branch or Benefit accruing from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
if ſo, how unjuſt are thoſe who
arraign 'em for their Parents Faults, and
how barbarous are thoſe Parents, who, tho'
able, make no Proviſion for them, becauſe
they are not Legitimate: My Child, is my
Child, let it be begot in Sin or Wedlock,
and all the Duties of a Parent are incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on me ſo long as it lives; if it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives
me, I ought to make a Proviſion for
it, according to my Ability; and tho' I do
not ſet it on a Footing with my Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Children, I ought in Conſcience, to
provide againſt Want and Shame, or I am
anſwerable for every Sin or Extravagance
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0316800100:12"/>
my Child is forc'd or led into, for want
of my giving an Allowance to prevent it.</p>
               <p>We have an Inſtance very freſh, in every
ones Memory, of an ingenious, nay, a ſober
young Nobleman, for ſuch I muſt call him,
whoſe either Father was a Peer, and his
Mother a Peereſs: This unhappy Gentleman
toſs'd from Father to Father, at laſt found
none, and himſelf a Vagabond, forced to
every Shift; he in a manner ſtarved for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years, yet was guilty of no Capital
Crime, till that unhappy Accident occur'd,
which God has given him Grace, and
Senſe enough-to repent: However, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think his hard-hearted Mother
will bear her Portion of the Guilt, till
waſh'd away by a ſevere Repentance.</p>
               <p>What a Figure might this Man have
made in Life, had due Care been taken? If
his Peerage had not been adjuſted, he might
at leaſt have been a fine Gentleman; nay
probably, have fill'd ſome handſome Poſt
in the Government with Applauſe, and
call'd as much for Reſpect, as he does now
for Pity.</p>
               <p>Nor is this Gentleman the only Perſon
begot, and neglected by Noble, or rather
Ignoble Parents; we have but too many now
living, who owe their Birth to the beſt of our
Peerage, and yet know not where to eat.
Hard Fate, when the Child would be glad
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0316800100:13"/>
the Scraps, which the Servants throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way!
but Heaven generally rewards them
accordingly, for many Noble Families
are become Extinct, and large Eſtates ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated
into other Houſes, while their own
Iſſue want Bread.</p>
               <p>And now, methinks, I hear ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſqueamiſh
Ladies cry, <hi>what would this
Fellow be at? would not he ſet up a
Nurſery for Lewdneſs, and encourage
Fornication? who would be afraid of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
if they can ſo eaſily get rid of their
Baſtards? we ſhall ſoon be over-run with</hi>
Foundlings <hi>when there is ſuch Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given to</hi> Whoredom: To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that I am as much againſt Baſtards
being begot, as I am for their being mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd;
but when a Child is once begot,
it cannot be unbegotten; and when once
born it muſt be kept; the Fault, as I ſaid
before, is in the Parents, not the Child;
and we ought to ſhew our Charity towards
it as a Fellow-Creature and Chriſtian,
without any regard to its Legitimacy or
otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The only way to put a ſtop to this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Evil, would be to oblige all Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers,
not to admit a Man and Woman
as Lodgers, till they were certify'd of their
being lawfully marry'd; for now-a-Days
nothing is more common than for a Whore-monger
and a Strumpet to pretend Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0316800100:14"/>
till they have left a Child or two
on the Pariſh, and then ſhift to another
end of the Town.</p>
               <p>If there were no Receivers there would
be no Thieves: If there were no Bawdy-Houſes
there would be no Whores; and
though Perſons letting Lodgings be not
actual Procurers, yet, if they connive at
the Embraces of a Couple, whoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is doubtful, they are no better than
Bawds, and their Houſes no more than
Brothels.</p>
               <p>Now ſhould any Body ask, how ſhall
this Hoſpital be Built? how endow'd?
to which I anſwer, follow the Steps of the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Hamburgers,</hi> and other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign

proſecuted this glorious Deſign, and found
their Account therein: As for building a

not the Capital, of unwary Stock-mongers?</p>
               <p>To my great Joy I find my Project al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
anticipated, and a noble Subſcription
carrying on for this purpoſe; to promote
which, I exhort all Perſons of Compaſſion

               <p>IT will no doubt be asked, what have I
to do with Muſick? to which I anſwer,
I have been a Lover of the Science from my
Infancy, and in my younger Days was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
no deſpicable Performer on the Viol
and Lute, then much in Vogue. I eſteem it
the moſt innocent Amuſement in Life; it
gently relaxes, after too great a hurry of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and compoſes the Mind into a Sedateneſs,
prone to every thing that's generous and
good; and when the more neceſſary parts
of Education are finiſh'd, 'tis a moſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel
and commendable Accompliſhment; it
ſaves a great deal of Drinking and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
in our Sex, and helps the Ladies off
with many an idle Hour, which ſometimes

               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0316800100:16"/>
Our Quality, Gentry, and better ſort
of Traders muſt have Diverſions; and if
thoſe that are commendable be denied, they
will take to worſe: Now what can be more
commendable than Muſick, one of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
liberal Sciences, and no mean Branch
of the Mathematicks?</p>
               <p>Were it for no other Reaſon I ſhould
eſteem it, becauſe it was the favourite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of his late Majeſty, of glorious
Memory; who was as wife a Prince as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fill'd the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne. Nor is it
leſs eſteem'd by their preſent Majeſties,
whoſe Souls are form'd for Harmony, and
who have not diſdain'd to make it a part
in the Education of their ſacred Race.</p>
               <p>Our Nobility and Gentry have ſhown
their Love to the Science, by ſupporting at
ſuch prodigious Expence, the <hi>Italian Opera</hi>
improperly call'd an Academy; but they have
at the ſame time ſhown no ſmall Partiality
in diſcouraging any thing <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-loading
the Town with ſuch heaps of
Foreign <hi>Muſicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Academy, rightly underſtood, is a
Place for the Propagation of Science, by
training up Perſons thereto from younger
to riper Years, under the Inſtruction and
Inſpection of proper Artiſts: How then can
the <hi>Italian Opera</hi> properly be call'd an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,
when none are admitted but ſuch as
are, at leaſt are thought, or ought to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0316800100:17"/>
be, adepts in Muſick? If that be an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,
ſo are the Theatres of <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi>
and <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields:</hi> Nay, <hi>Punch</hi>'s
<hi>Opera</hi> may paſs for a lower kind of Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy.
Would it not be a glorious thing
to have an <hi>Opera</hi> of our own, in our own
moſt noble Tongue, in which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer,
Singers, and Orcheſtre, ſhould be
of our own Growth? Not that we ought
to diſclaim all Obligations to <hi>Italy,</hi> the
Mother of Muſick, the Nurſe of <hi>Corelli,
Handel, Bononcini,</hi> and <hi>Geminiani;</hi> but
then we ought not to be ſo ſtupidly
partial, to imagine our Selves too Brutal
a part of Mankind, to make any Progreſs
in the Science: By the ſame reaſon that we
love it, we may excel in it; Love begets
Application, and Application Perfection.
We have already had a <hi>Purcel,</hi> and no
doubt, there are now many latent Genius's,
who only want proper Inſtruction, Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and ENCOURAGEMENT, to become
great Ornaments of the Science, and make
<hi>England</hi> emulate even <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>What a number of excellent Performers
on all Inſtruments, have ſprung up in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
within theſe few Years? that this is
owing to the <hi>Opera,</hi> I will not deny, and
ſo far the <hi>Opera</hi> is an Academy, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
the Taſte, and inſpires Emulation.</p>
               <p>But tho' we are happy in Inſtrumental
Performers, we frequently ſend to <hi>Italy</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0316800100:18"/>
for Singers, and that at no ſmall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:
To remedy which, I humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that the Governours of <hi>Chriſt's-Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital</hi>
will ſhow their publick Spirit, by
forming an Academy of Muſick on their
Foundation, after this or the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>That
out of their great number of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
thirty Boys be ſelected, of good Ears
and Propenſity to Muſick.</p>
               <p>That theſe Boys be divided into three
Claſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Six for Wind-Inſtruments,
ſuch as the Hautboy, Baſſoon, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Flute.</p>
               <p>That
ſixteen others be ſelected for String-Inſtruments,
or at leaſt the moſt uſeful, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Violin and Baſs-Violin.</p>
               <p>That the remaining eight be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
choſen for Voice, and Organ, or
Harpſichord. That all in due time, be
taught Compoſition. The Boys thus cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
three Maſters ſhould be elected, each
moſt excellent in his Way; that is to ſay,
one for the Wind-Inſtrument, another for
the String'd, and a third for the Voice and
Organ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Handſome Salaries ſhould be allowed
theſe Maſters, to engage their conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
every Day, from eight till twelve
in the Morning; and I think a 100<hi>l.
per Annum</hi> for each, would be ſufficient,
which will be a Trifle to ſo wealthy a Body.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0316800100:19"/>
The multiplicity of Holidays ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg'd,
and only a few kept; there
cannot be too few, conſidering what a
hinderance they are to juvenile Studies. It
is a vulgar Error that has too long prevail'd
all over <hi>England,</hi> to the great Detriment
of Learning, and many Boys have been
made Blockheads, in Complaiſance to
Kings and Saints, dead for many Ages
paſt.</p>
               <p>The Morning employ'd in Muſick, the
Boys ſhould go in the Afternoon, or ſo
many Hours, to the Reading and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-School,
and in the Evening ſhould
practice, at leaſt two Hours before Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
and two before the Maſter comes in
the Morning. This Courſe held for ſeven
or eight Years, will make them fine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients;
but that they ſhould not go too
raw, or young, out of the Academy, 'tis
proper, that at the ſtated Age of Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip,
they be bound to the Hoſpital to
engage their greater Application, and make
them thorough Maſters, before they launch
out into the World; for one great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to many Performers is, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to teach too ſoon, and obſtruct their
Genius.</p>
               <p>What will not ſuch a Deſign produce in
a few Years? will they not be able to perform
a Conſort, Choir, or Opera, or all three a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0316800100:20"/>
themſelves, and over-pay the Charge,
as ſhall hereafter be ſpecify'd?</p>
               <p>For Example, we will ſuppoſe ſuch a
Deſign to be continued for ten Years, we
ſhall find an Orcheſtre of forty Hands, and
a Choir or Opera of twenty Voices, or
admitting that of thoſe twenty, only five
prove Capital Singers, 'twill anſwer the
Intent.</p>
               <p>For the greater Variety they may, if
they think fit, take in two or more of their
Girls where they find a promiſing Genius,
but this may be further conſider'd of.</p>
               <p>Now, when they are enabled to exhibit
an Opera, Will they not gain conſiderably,
when their Voices and Hands, coſt them
only a College Subſiſtance? And 'tis but
reaſonable the Profits accruing from Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Conſorts, or otherwiſe, ſhould go to
the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> to make good all former and
future Expences, and enable them to extend
the Deſign to a greater Length and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur;
ſo than inſtead of 1500 l. <hi>per Ann.</hi>
the price of one <hi>Italian</hi> Singer, we ſhall
for 300 l. once in ten Years, have ſixty
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Muſicians regularly educated, and
enabled to live by their Science.</p>
               <p>There ought moreover to be annual Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and proper Prizes or Premiums alloted,
to excite Emulation in the Youths, and give
Life to their Studies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0316800100:21"/>
They have already a Muſick-School, as
they call it, but the Allowance is too poor
for this Deſign, and the Attendance too
ſmall; it muſt be every Day, or not at all.</p>
               <p>This will be an Academy indeed, and in
Proceſs of Time, they will have even their
Maſters among themſelves; and what is the
Charge, compar'd with the Profits or
their Abilities?</p>
               <p>One thing I had like to have forgot, which
is, that with Permiſſion of the Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
the Lords Spiritual, ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
in Muſick, ſuitable to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of the Day, be exhibited every
Sunday after Divine Service: Sacred Poeſy
and Rhetorick, may be likewiſe introduc'd to
make it an Entertainment ſuitable to a Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian
and Polite Audience; and indeed, we
ſeem to want ſome ſuch commendable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
for the better Sort: For we ſee
the publick Walks and Taverns crowded,
and rather than be idle, they will go to
<hi>Newport- Market.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſuch an Entertainment would be
much preferable to Drinking, Gaming, or
profane Diſcourſe, none can deny, and till
it is proved to be prejudicial, I ſhall always
imagine it neceſſary. The Hall at the <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,</hi>
will contain few leſs than ſeven
hundred People, conveniently ſeated, which
at ſo ſmall a Price as one Shilling <hi>per</hi> Head,
will amount to 35 l. per Week; and if the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0316800100:22"/>
Performance deſerve it, as no doubt it
will in time, they may make it half a
Crown or more, which muſt conſiderably
encreaſe the Income of the <hi>Hoſpital.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they are able to make an Opera,
the Profits will be yet more conſiderable,
nor will they reap much leſs from what
the Youths bring in during their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip,
when employ'd at Conſorts,
Theatres, or other publick Entertainments.</p>
               <p>Having advanc'd what I think proper on
this Head, or at leaſt enough for a Hint,
I proceed to offer,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>That many Youths and Servants may be
ſav'd from Deſtruction, were the Streets
clear'd of ſhameleſs and impudent
Strumpets; Gaming-Tables totally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
and a ſtop put to Sabbath De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches.</head>
               <p>THE Corruption of our Children
and Servants, is of Importance ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to require our utmoſt Precaution; and
moreover, Women Servants (common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call'd Maid-Servants) are ſuch neceſſary
Creatures, that it is by no means below us
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0316800100:23"/>
to make them beneficial rather than preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to us.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not run into a Deſcription
of their Abuſes; we know enough of
thoſe already. Our Buſineſs now is to
make them uſeful, Firſt, by aſcertaining
their Wages at a proper Standard.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by obliging them to continue
longer in Service, not to ſtroll about
from Place to Place, and throw themſelves
on the Town on every Diſlike.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To prevent their being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
by wicked Perſons, when out of
Place; or living too long on their own
Hands.</p>
               <p>As for their Wages, they have topp'd upon
us already, and doubled 'em in ſpight of our
Teeth; but as they have had Wit enough
to get 'em, ſo will they, I doubt not,
have the ſame Senſe to keep 'em: and
much Good may it do thoſe indolent over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure
Perſons, who have given 'em this
Advantage. However, if they are honeſt
and diligent, I would have them encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd,
and handſome Wages allow'd 'em;
becauſe, by this Means, we provide for
the Children of the inferior Claſs of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who otherwiſe could not maintain
themſelves; nay, ſometimes Tradeſmen,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> reduced, are glad when their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ceaſe to hang upon them, by getting
into Service, and by that Means, not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0316800100:24"/>
only maintaining themſelves, but being
of Uſe in other Families. But then there
ought to be ſome Medium ſome Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Wages, or they may extort
more than can well be afforded.</p>
               <p>Nothing calls more for Redreſs than
their quitting Service for every idle Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,
leaving a Maſter or Miſtreſs at a
Nonplus; and all under Plea of a fooliſh
old Cuſtom, call'd Warning; no where
practis'd but in <hi>London:</hi> For in other
Places they are hir'd by the Year, or by
the Statute, as they call it, which ſettles
them in a Place, at leaſt for ſome Time;
whereas, when they are not limited, it
encourages a roving Temper, and makes
them never eaſy.</p>
               <p>If you turn them away without Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they will make you pay a Month's
Wages, be the Provocation or Offence
never ſo great; but if they leave you,
tho' never ſo abruptly, or unprovided,
help yourſelves how you can, there is no
Redreſs: Tho' I think there ought, in all
Conſcience, to be as much Law for the
Maſter as for the Servant.</p>
               <p>No Servant ſhould quit a Place, where
they are well fed and paid, without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
a good Reaſon before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
On the other Hand, they ſhould
receive no Abuſe which ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd:
For we ought to treat 'em as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0316800100:25"/>
Servants, not Slaves; and a Medium
ought to be obſerv'd on both Sides. But
if they are not reſtrain'd from quitting
Service on every Vagary, they will throw
themſelves on the Town, and not only
ruin themſelves, but others: For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
a Girl quits a Place, and turns Whore;
if there is not a Baſtard to be murder'd,
or left to the Pariſh, there is One or more
unwary Youths drawn in to ſupport her
in Lewdneſs and Idleneſs; in order to
which, they rob their Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
nay, ſometimes any Body elſe, to
ſupport their Strumpets; ſo that many
Thieves owe their Ruin and ſhameful
Deaths to Harlots. Not to mention the
Communication of loathſome Diſtempers,
and innumerable other Evils, to which
they give Birth.</p>
               <p>How many Youths, of all Ranks, are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruin'd? And how juſtly may be dreaded
the Loſs of as many more, if a ſpeedy Stop
be not put to this growing Evil? Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to come will curſe the Neglect of the
preſent, and every Sin committed for the
future may be paſs'd to our Account, if we
do not uſe our Endeavours to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And unleſs we prevent our Maid-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
from being harbour'd by wicked
Perſons when out of Place, or living too
long on their own Hands, our Streets will
ſwarm with impudent ſhameleſs Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0316800100:26"/>
the Good will be moleſted; thoſe,
prone to Evil, will be made yet more
wicked, by having Temptations thrown
in their Way: And to crown all, we ſhall
have ſcarce a Servant left, but our Wives,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt do the Houſhold-work them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>If
this be not worthy the Conſideration
of a Legiſlature, I would fain know
what is. Is it not Time to limit their
Wages, when they are grown ſo wanton
they know not what to ask? Is it not
Time to fix 'em, when they ſtroll from
Place to Place, and we are hardly ſure of
a Servant a Month together? Is it not
Time to prevent the Encreaſe of Harlots,
by making it penal for Servants to be
harbour'd in Idleneſs, and tempted to
Theft, Whoredom, Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by living
too long out of Place? And I am ſure
it is high Time to begin the Work, by
clearing the publick Streets of Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walkers,
who are grown to ſuch a Pitch
of Impudence, that Peace and common
Decency are manifeſtly broken in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Streets. I wonder this has ſo long
eſcap'd the Eye of the Magiſtrate, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when there are already in force
Laws ſufficient to reſtrain this Tide of
Uncleanneſs, which will one Day over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0316800100:27"/>
The lewdeſt People upon Earth, our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
excepted, are not guilty of ſuch
open Violations of the Laws of Decency.
Go all the World over, and you'll ſee no
ſuch Impudence as in the Streets of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
which makes many Foreigners give
our Women in general a bad Character,
from the vile Specimens they meet with
from one End of the Town to the other.
Our Seſſions-Papers are full of the Triais
of impudent Sluts, who firſt decoy Men,
and then rob 'em: A Meanneſs the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſans
of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> abhor.</p>
               <p>How many honeſt Women, thoſe of
the Inferior Sort eſpecially, get loathſome
Diſtempers from their Husband's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with theſe Creatures, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
are often entail'd on Poſterity;
nor have we an Hoſpital ſeparated for that
Purpoſe, which does not contain too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Inſtances of honeſt poor Wretches
made miſerable by Villains of Husbands.</p>
               <p>And now I have mentioned the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy
of ſome Husbands in the lower
State of Life, give me leave to propoſe,
or at leaſt to wiſh, that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
from abuſing their Wives at that
barbarous Rate, which is now practiſed
by Butchers, Carmen, and ſuch inferior
Sort of Fellows, who are publick Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances
to civil Neighbourhoods, and yet no
Body cares to interpoſe, becauſe the Riot
is between a Man and his Wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0316800100:28"/>
I ſee no Reaſon why every profligate
Fellow ſhall have the Liberty to diſturb a
whole Neighbourhood, and abuſe a poor
honeſt Creature at a moſt inhuman Rate,
and is not to be call'd to Account becauſe
it is his Wife; this ſort of Barbarity was
never ſo notorious and ſo much encourag'd
as at preſent, for every Vagabond thinks
he may cripple his Wife at pleaſure, and
'tis enough to pierce a Heart of Stone to
ſee how barbarouſly ſome poor Creatures
are beaten and abuſed by mercileſs Dogs
of Husbands.</p>
               <p>It gives an ill Example to the growing
Generation, and this Evil will gain Ground
on us if not prevented: It may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
the Law has already provided Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
and a Woman abus'd may ſwear
the Peace againſt her Husband, but what
Woman cares to do that? It is reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herſelf on herſelf, and not without
conſiderable Charge and Trouble.</p>
               <p>There ought to be a ſhorter way, and
when a Man has beaten his Wife (which
by the Bye is a moſt unmanly Action, and
great Sign of Cowardice) it behoves every
Neighbour who has the leaſt humanity or
Compaſſion, to complain to the next Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the Peace, who ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
to ſet him in the Stocks for the
firſt Offence; to have him well ſcourg'd at
the Whipping-Poſt for the ſecond; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0316800100:29"/>
if he perſiſted in his barbarous Abuſe of the
holy Marriage State, to ſend him to the
Houſe of Correction 'till he ſhould learn
to uſe more Mercy to his Yoke-fellow.</p>
               <p>How hard is it for a poor induſtrious
Woman to be up early and late, to ſit in a
cold Shop, Stall, or Market, all Weathers,
to carry heavy Loads from one End of the
Town to the other, or to work from
Morning till Night, and even then dread
going Home for fear of being murder'd?
Some may think this too low a Topic for
me to expatiate upon, to which I anſwer,
that it is a Charitable and a Chriſtian one,
and therefore not in the leaſt beneath the
Conſideration of any Man who had a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
for his Mother.</p>
               <p>The Mention of this leads me to exclaim
againſt the vile Practice now ſo much in
vogue among the better Sort, as they are
called, but the worſt ſort in fact, namely,
the ſending their Wives to Mad-Houſes at
every Whim or Diſlike, that they may be
more ſecure and undiſturb'd in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries:
Which wicked Cuſtom is got to
ſuch a Head, that the Number of private
Mad-Houſes in and about <hi>London,</hi> are
conſiderably increaſed within theſe few
Years.</p>
               <p>This is the heighth of Barbarity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
in a Chriſtian Country, it is a
clandeſtine Inquiſition, nay worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0316800100:30"/>
How many Ladies and Gentlewomen
are hurried away to theſe Houſes, which
ought to be ſuppreſs'd, or at leaſt ſubject
to daily Examination, as hereafter ſhall
be propoſed?</p>
               <p>How many, I ſay, of Beauty, Vertue,
and Fortune, are ſuddenly torn from their
dear innocent Babes, from the Arms of an
unworthy Man, who they love (perhaps
but too well) and who in Return for
that Love, nay probably an ample Fortune,
and a lovely Off-ſpring beſides; grows
weary of the pure Streams of chaſte Love,
and thirſting after the Puddles of lawleſs
Luſt, buries his vertuous Wife alive, that
he may have the greater Freedom with
his Miſtreſſes?</p>
               <p>If they are not mad when they go into
theſe curſed Houſes, they are ſoon made
ſo by the barbarous Uſage they there ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and any Woman of Spirit who has
the leaſt Love for her Husband, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for her Family, cannot ſit down tamely
under a Confinement and Separation the
moſt unaccountable and unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>Is it not enough to make any one mad
to be ſuddenly clap'd up, ſtripp'd, whipp'd,
ill fed, and worſe us'd? To have no Reaſon
aſſign'd for ſuch Treatment, no Crime al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
or Accuſers to confront? And what
is worſe, no Soul to appeal to but merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Creatures, who anſwer but in Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0316800100:31"/>
Surlineſs, Contradiction, and too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Stripes?</p>
               <p>All Conveniences for Writing are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
no Meſſenger to be had to carry a
Letter to any Relation or Friend; and
if this tyrannical Inquiſition, join'd with the
reaſonable Reflections, a Woman of any
common Underſtanding muſt neceſſarily
make, be not ſufficient to drive any Soul
ſtark ſtaring mad, though before they were
never ſo much in their right Senſes, I have
no more to ſay.</p>
               <p>When by this Means a wicked Husband
has driven a poor Creature mad, and rob'd
an injur'd Wife of her Reaſon, for 'tis
much eaſier to create than to cure Madneſs,
then has the Villain a handle for his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guery,
then perhaps he will admit her
diſtreſſed Relations to ſee her, when 'tis
too late to cure the Madneſs he ſo artfully
and barbarouſly has procured.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, ſomething more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Effects attend this Inquiſition, for Death
is but too often the Cure of their Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and End of their Sorrows; ſome with
ill Uſage, ſome with Grief, and many with
both are barbarouſly cut off in the Prime
of their Years and Flower of their Health,
who otherwiſe might have been Mothers of
a numerous Iſſue, and ſurviv'd many Years.
This is Murder in the deepeſt Senſe, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0316800100:32"/>
much more cruel than Dagger or Poiſon,
becauſe more lingring; they die by Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal,
and in all the Agonies and Terrors
of a diſtracted Mind.</p>
               <p>Nay it is Murder upon Murder, for the
Iſſue that might have been begot, is to
be accounted for to God and the Publick.
Now if this kind of Murder is conniv'd
at, we ſhall no doubt have enough, nay
too much of it; for if a Man is weary of
his Wife, has ſpent her Fortune, and
wants another, 'tis but ſending her to a
Mad-Houſe and the Buſineſs is done at once.</p>
               <p>How many have already been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
after this manner is beſt known to
juſt Heaven, and thoſe unjuſt Husbands
and their damn'd Accomplices, who, tho'
now ſecure in their Guilt, will one Day
find 'tis Murder of the blackeſt Dye; has
the leaſt claim for Mercy, and calls aloud
for the ſevereſt Vengeance.</p>
               <p>How many are yet to be ſacrificed, unleſs
a ſpeedy Stop be put to this moſt accurſed
Practice I tremble to think; our Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot take this Cauſe too ſoon in
hand: This ſurely cannot be below their
Notice, and 'twill be an eaſy matter at
once to ſuppreſs all theſe pretended Mad-Houſes.
Indulge, gentle Reader, for once
the doting of an old Man, and give him
leave to lay down his little Syſtem with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
arraigning him of Arrogance or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0316800100:33"/>
to a be Law-giver. In my humble
Opinion all private Mad-Houſes ſhould be
ſuppreſs'd at once, and it ſhould be no leſs
than Felony to confine any Perſon under
pretence of Madneſs without due Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>For
the cure of thoſe who are really
Lunatick, licens'd Mad-Houſes ſhould be
conſtituted in convenient Parts of the
Town, which Houſes ſhould be ſubject to
proper Viſitation and Inſpection, nor
ſhould any Perſon be ſent to a Mad-Houſe
without due Reaſon, Inquiry and
Authority.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, by Perſons deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to contradict every thing and approve
nothing, that the Abuſes complained of
are not ſo numerous or heinous as I would
inſinuate: Why are not Facts advanced,
they will be apt ſay, to give a Face of
Truth to theſe Aſſertions? but I have two
Reaſons to the contrary; the firſt is, the
more you convince them the more angry
you make 'em, for they are never better
pleaſed than when they have an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of finding Fault: Therefore to curry
Favour with the Fault-finders, I have left
'em a loop Hole: the ſecond and real is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I don't care to bring an old Houſe over
my Head by mentioning particular Names
or ſpecial Caſes, thereby drawing my
ſelf into vexatious Proſecutions and Suits
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0316800100:34"/>
at Law, from litigious Wretches, who
would be galled to find their Villainies
made publick; and ſtick at no Expence
or foul Play to revenge themſelves. Not
but I could bring many Inſtances, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of an unhappy Widow, put in by a
Villain of a Husband, and now continued
in for the ſake of her Jointure by her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Son, FAR from common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
or Humanity. Of another whoſe
Husband keeps his Miſtreſs in black Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,
and is ſeen with her every Night at
the Opera or Play, while his poor Wife,
(by much the finer Woman) and of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
far ſuperior to her thick
Skull'd Tyrant, is kept mean in Diet and
Apparel, nay ill us'd into the Bargain;
notwithſtanding her Fortune ſupplies all
the Villain's Extravagancies, and he has
not a Shilling but what came from her:
but a Beggar when once ſet on Horſeback
proves always the moſt unmerciful RIDER.</p>
               <p>I cannot leave this Subject without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
one particular Caſe.</p>
               <p>A Lady of known Beauty, Vertue, and
Fortune, nay more, of Wiſdom, not flaſhy
Wit, was, in the Prime of her Youth and
Beauty, and when her Senſes were perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſound, carried by her Husband in his
Coach as to the Opera; but the Coachman
had other Inſtructions, and drove directly
to a Mad-Houſe, where the poor innocent
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0316800100:35"/>
Lady was no ſooner introduced, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of calling by the way to ſee ſome
Pictures he had a mind to buy, but the
Key was turn'd upon her, and ſhe left a
Priſoner by her faithleſs Husband; who
while his injur'd Wife was confined and
us'd with the utmoſt Barbarity, He like a
profligate Wretch ran through her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
with Strumpets, and then, baſely,
under Pretence of giving her Liberty,
extorted her to make over her Jointure:
which ſhe had no ſooner done but he
laugh'd in her Face, and left her to be
as ill us'd as ever. This he ſoon ran
through, and (happily for the Lady) died
by the Juſtice of Heaven in a Salivation his
Debauches had oblig'd him to undergo.</p>
               <p>During her Confinement, the Villain of
the Mad-Houſe frequently attempted her
Chaſtity; and the more ſhe repuls'd him,
the worſe he treated her: till at laſt he
drove her mad in good earneſt. Her
diſtreſſed Brother, who is fond of her to
the laſt Degree, now confines her in part
of his own Houſe, treating her with great
Tenderneſs; but has the Mortification to
be aſſured by the ableſt Phyſicians, that his
poor Siſter is irrecoverably diſtracted.</p>
               <p>Numberleſs are the Inſtances I could
produce, but they would be accounted fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious,
becauſe I don't name the particular
Perſons, for the Reaſons before aſſigned;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0316800100:36"/>

not fictitious, nor are the Villainy of theſe

I take the Itch of gaming to be the moſt
pernicious of Vices, it is a kind of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious
Madneſs; and if People have not
Senſe to command themſelves by Reaſon,
they ought to be reſtrained by Law:
Nor ſuffered to ruin themſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,

               <p>There is no playing on the Square with
theſe Villains; they are ſure to cheat you,
either by ſlight of Hand, Confederacy, or
falſe Dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have ſo much the
Odds of their infatuated Bubbles, that
they might ſafely play a Guinea to a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and yet be ſure of winning. This
is but genteel Pocket-picking, or Felony
with another Name, and yet, ſo fond are
we of it, that from the Foot-boy to the
Lord, all muſt have a touch of gaming;
and there are Sharpers of different Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Denominations, from <hi>Southwark
Fair</hi> to the <hi>Groom Porters.</hi> Shame, that
Gentlemen ſhould ſuffer every Scoundrel
to mix with them for Gaming ſake! And
equal Shame, that honeſt laborious Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhould be obſtructed in croſſing the

Gameſters; who now infeſt the
Land, and brave even our Nobility and
Gentry with their own Money!</p>
               <p>But the moſt barbarous Part of this
helliſh Trade, is what they call ſetting
of young Gentlemen, Apprentices, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0316800100:39"/>
others; this ought to be deem'd Felony,
without Benefit of Clergy; for 'tis the
worſt of Thievery. Under Pretence of
taking a Bottle, or ſpending an Evening
gayly, they draw their Cull to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
where they ſit not long before the
Devil's Bones or Books are found acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
on purpoſe, by the Help of which
they ſtrip my Gentleman in an Inſtant,
and then generouſly lend him his own
Money, to loſe a freſh, and create a Debt,
which is but too often more juſtly paid
than thoſe more juſtly due.</p>
               <p>If we look into ſome late Bankrupcies,
we ſhall find ſome noted Gameſters the
principal Creditors; I think, in ſuch
Caſes, 'twould be but Juſtice to make
void the Gameſter's Debt, and ſubject his
Eſtate to make good the Deficiencies
of the Bankrupt's Effects. If Traders
have no more Wit, the Publick ſhould
have Pity on 'em; and make it as penal
to loſe as to win: And, in Truth, if
Cards, Dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were totally ſuppreſs'd,
Induſtry and Arts would encreaſe the
more; Gaming may make a Man crafty,
but not polite; one may underſtand Cards
and Dice perfectly well, and be a Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in every Thing elſe.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry to ſee it ſo prevalent in the
City, among the trading Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who have introduc'd it into their
Clubs, and Play ſo high of late, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0316800100:40"/>
many Bankrupts have been made by this
pernicious Practice.</p>
               <p>It is the Bane of all Converſation: And
thoſe who can't ſit an Hour without
Gaming, ſhould never go into a Club to
ſpoil Company. In a Word, 'tis mere
Madneſs, and a moſt ſtupid Thing to
hazard ones Fortune, and perplex ones
Mind; nay, to ſit up whole Nights,
poring over Toys of pipt Ivory and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Paſteboard, making our ſelves worſe
than little Children, whoſe innocent Sports
we ſo much ridicule.</p>
               <p>To ſum up all, I think 'twould be a

Eſtates to the Uſe and Support of the poor
Widows and Orphans of their unfortunate

               <p>While we want Servants to do our
Work, thoſe Hundreds, as they call 'em,
are crowded with Numbers of idle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Sluts, who love Sporting more
than Spinning, and inveigle our Youth to
their Ruin: Nay, many old Lechers
(Beaſts as they are) ſteal from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and ſeek theſe Harlot's lurking
Holes, to practice their unaccountable
Schemes of new invented Lewdneſſes:
Some half hang themſelves, others are
whipt, ſome lie under a Table and gnaw
the Bones that are thrown 'em, while
others ſtand ſlaving among a Parcel of
Drabs at a Waſhing-Tub. Strange that
the Inclination ſhould not die with the
Power, but that old Fools ſhould make
themſelves the Prey and Ridicule of a
Pack of Strumpets!</p>
               <p>Some heedleſs Youths are wheedled into
Marriage, which makes them and their
unhappy Parents miſerable all their Lives;
others are drawn into Extravagancies, and
but too often run into their Maſter's Caſh,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0316800100:42"/>
and for fear of a Diſcovery, make away
with themſelves; or at leaſt run away and
leave their diſtracted Parents in a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Fears: Not to mention the Fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Fortune, and the Miſeries
that attend a Vagabond Life. Thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Parents loſe their Children, and
Traders their Apprentices, and all from
a Liberty we have of late given our Youth
of rambling Abroad on <hi>Sundays:</hi> For many,
now a-days, will lie out all Night, or ſtay
out ſo late to give no ſmall Diſturbance in
ſober Families. It therefore behoves every
Maſter of a Family to have his Servants
under his Eye: And if the going to Church,
Meeting, or whatever Place of Worſhip
ſuited their Religion, were more enforc'd,
it would be ſo much the better.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the Luxury of the Age will
be the Ruin of the Nation, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
We leave Trade to game in
Stocks: We live above ourſelves, and
barter our Ready-money for Trifles; Tea
and Wine are all we ſeem anxious for, and
God has given the Bleſſings of Life to an
ungrateful People, who deſpiſe their own
Productions. Our very Plough-Fellows
drink Wine now a-days: Our Farmers,
Graſiers, and Butchers, are above Malt-Liquors;
and the wholeſome Breakfaſt of
Water-gruel and Milk-pottage is chang'd
for Coffee and Tea. This is the Reaſon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0316800100:43"/>
Proviſions and Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo dear; we
all work for Vintners, and raiſe our Prices
one upon another to ſuch a Degree, 'twill
be an Impoſſibility to live, and we ſhall,
of Courſe, become our own Devourers.</p>
               <p>We ſtrain at a Gnat and ſwallow a
Camel: And, in this Inſtance, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Houſes are kept open to furniſh our
Luxury, while we deny ourſelves other
Neceſſaries of Life, out of a Scruple of
Conſcience. For Example; in extreme
hot Weather, when Meat will not keep
from <hi>Saturday</hi> to <hi>Sunday,</hi> we throw, or
cauſe to be thrown away, vaſt Quantities
of tainted Meat, and have generally ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dinners, becauſe the Butchers dare
not ſell a Joint of Meat on a <hi>Sunday</hi>
Morning. Now, tho' I would not have
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſo far violated as to have it
Market-Day, yet, rather than abuſe God's
Mercies by throwing away Creatures
given for our Uſe, nay, for our own
Healths and Cleanlineſs Sake, I would
have the ſame Indulgence in extreme hot
Weather, as there is for Milk and Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell;
that is to ſay, that Meat might be
kill'd in the cool of the Morning, <hi>viz.</hi>
One or Two of the Clock, and ſold 'till
Nine, and no longer: Nor ſhould vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous
Informers have Power to moleſt
them in this innocent and reaſonable
Amendment of a ridiculous vulgar Error.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0316800100:44"/>
I cannot forbear taking Notice of the
extravagant Uſe, or rather Abuſe of that
nauſeous Liquor, call'd <hi>GENEVA,</hi>
among our lower ſort. Thoſe who deny,
that an inferior Claſs of People are moſt
neceſſary in a Body Politick, contradict
Reaſon and Experience itſelf, ſince they
are moſt uſeful when Induſtrious, and as
pernicious when lazy. By their Induſtry
our Manufactures, Trade, and Commerce
are carried on: The Merchant in his
Compting Houſe, and the Captain in his
Cabbin would find but little Employment
were it not that many Hands carried on
the different Branches of the Concern
they ſuperintended.</p>
               <p>But now ſo far are our common People
infatuated with <hi>Geneva,</hi> that Half the
Work is not done now as formerly. It
debilitates and enervates them, and they
are not near ſo ſtrong and healthy as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
This accurſed Liquor is in itſelf
ſo diuretick, it over-ſtrains the Parts of
Generation, and makes our common
People incapable of getting ſuch luſty
Children as they us'd to do. Add to this,
that the Women, by drinking it, ſpoil
their Milk, and by giving it to young
Children, as they fooliſhly do, ſpoil
the Stomach, and hinder Digeſtion; ſo
that in leſs than an Age, we may expect
a fine Spindle-ſhank'd Generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0316800100:45"/>
There is not in Nature ſo unhealthy a
Liquor as <hi>Geneva,</hi> eſpecially as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſold: It curdles the Blood, it ſtupifies
the Senſes, it weakens the Nerves, it ſpoils
the Eye-ſight, and entirely ruins the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;
nay, ſome Stomachs have been
render'd ſo cold by the Uſe of <hi>Geneva,</hi>
that Lamp-Spirits have not been a Dram
warm enough for 'em. Surely they will
come to drink <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> at laſt!</p>
               <p>On the contrary, our own Malt Liquors,
eſpecially common Draught Beer, is moſt
wholeſome and nouriſhing, and has
brought up better Generations than the
preſent: It is ſtrengthening, cooling, and
balſamick: It helps Digeſtion, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Nouriſhment with it. And, in ſpight
of the Whims of ſome Phyſicians, is moſt
pertinent to a humane, eſpecially a good
wholeſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution. Nay,
the honeſt Part of the Faculty deny not
the Uſe of Small-Beer well brew'd, even
in Fevers. I my ſelf have found great
Benefit by it; and if it be good in its Kind
'tis the fineſt Julap upon Earth.</p>
               <p>If this Abuſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> be not ſtopt,
we may go whoop for Husbandmen, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Trade muſt conſequently ſtand
ſtill, and the Credit of the Nation ſink:
Nor is the Abatement of the Exciſe, tho'

               <p>THE
principal Encouragements, and
Opportunity given to Street-Robbers
is, that our Streets are ſo poorly watch'd;
the Watchmen, for the moſt Part, being
decrepid, ſuperannuated Wretches, with
one Foot in the Grave, and the t'other
ready to follow; ſo feeble, that a Puff
of Breath can blow 'em down: Poor crazy
Mortals! Much fitter for an Alms-houſe
than a Watch-houſe. A City watch'd and
guarded by ſuch Animals, is wretchedly
watch'd indeed.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſo little Terror do our Watchmen
carry with them, that hardy Thieves make
a mere Jeſt of 'em, and ſometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
even the very Watchmen, who ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
'em, to light 'em in their Roguery:
And what can a poor Creature do, in Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of his Life, ſurrounded by a Pack of
Ruffians, and no Aſſiſtance near.</p>
               <p>Add to this, that our Rogues are grown
more wicked than ever, and Vice in all
Kinds is ſo much wink'd at, that Robbery
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0316800100:47"/>
is accounted a petty Crime. We take pains
to puff 'em up in their Villainy, and Thieves
are ſet out in ſo amiable a Light in the
<hi>Beggar's Opera,</hi> that it has taught them to
value themſelves on their Profeſſion, rather
than be aſham'd of it.</p>
               <p>There was ſome Ceſſation of Street-Robberies,
from the Time of <hi>Bunworth</hi>
and <hi>Blewitt</hi>'s Execution, 'till the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of this pious Opera. Now we find
the <hi>Cartouchian</hi> Villainies revived, and
<hi>London,</hi> that us'd to be the moſt ſafe and
peaceful City in the Univerſe, is now a
Scene of Rapine and Danger. If ſome of
<hi>Cartouch</hi>'s Gang be not come over to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
our Thieves, and propagate their
Schemes, we have, doubtleſs, a <hi>Cartouch</hi>
of our own, and a Gang, which, if not
ſuppreſs'd, may be full as pernicious as ever
<hi>Cartouch</hi>'s was, and <hi>London</hi> will be as
dangerous as <hi>Paris,</hi> if due Care be not
taken.</p>
               <p>We ought to begin our Endeavours to
ſuppreſs theſe Villainies; firſt by Heavenly,
and then by Earthly Means.</p>
               <p>By Heavenly Means, in enforcing and
encouraging a Reformation of Manners, by
ſuppreſſing of Vice and Immorality, and
puniſhing Prophaneneſs and Licentiouſneſs.
Our Youth are corrupted by filthy, lewd
Ballads, ſung and ſold publickly in our
Streets: Nay, unlicens'd and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Coachmen, Carmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are indulg'd
in Swearing after the moſt blaſphemous,
ſhocking, and unaccountable Rate that ever
was known. New Oaths and Blaſphemies
are daily utter'd and invented, and rather
than not exerciſe this helliſh Tallent, they
will vent their Curſes on their very Horſes;
and, Oh ſtupid! Damn the Blood of a
Poſt, rather than want ſomething to curſe.</p>
               <p>Our common Women too have learn'd
this Vice; and not only Strumpets, but
labouring Women, who keep our Markets,
and vend Things about Street, ſwear and
curſe at a moſt hideous Rate. Their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
learn it from the Parents, and thoſe
of the middle, or even the better Sort of
People, if they paſs through the Streets to
School, or to play, catch the Infection, and
carry home ſuch Words as muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
be very ſhocking to ſober Parents.</p>
               <p>Our Youth, in general, have too much
Liberty; the Sabbath is not kept with
due Solemnity; Maſters and Miſtreſſes of
Families are too remiſs in the Care of the
Souls committed to their Charge. Family
Prayer is neglected; and, to the Shame of
Scoffers be it ſpoken, too much ridiculed.
All Ages and Sexes, if in Health, ſhould
be obliged to attend publick Worſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

Were it only to keep Youth out of Harm's
Way, it would do well. But it is to be
hoped, if their Parents, Maſters, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
ſhould oblige their Attendance at
publick Devotion, they would edify by
what they ſhould hear, and many wicked
Acts would be ſtifled in their Infancy,
and check'd even in the Intention, by
good and uſeful Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Our common People make it a Day of
Debauch, and get ſo drunk on a Sunday,
they cannot work for a Day or two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
Nay, ſince the Uſe of Geneva
has become ſo common, many get ſo often
drunk they cannot work at all, but run
from one Irregularity to another, 'till at
laſt they become arrant Rogues. And
this is the Foundation of all our preſent
Complaints.</p>
               <p>We will ſuppoſe a Man able to maintain
himſelf and Family by his Trade, and at
the ſame Time to be a Geneva-drinker:
This Fellow firſt makes himſelf inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of working, by being continually
drunk; this runs him behind-hand, and
he either pawns or neglects his Work, for
which Reaſon no Body will employ him.
At laſt, Fear of Arreſts, his own Hunger,
the Cries of his Family for Bread, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Deſire to ſupport an irregular Life,
and a propenſe Hatred to Labour, turn
but too many an honeſt Tradeſman into
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0316800100:50"/>
an arrant deſperate Rogue: And theſe are
commonly the Means that furniſh us with
Thieves and Villains in general.</p>
               <p>Thus is a Man, that might be uſeful
in a Body politick, render'd obnoxious to
the ſame: And if this Trade of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
goes on, they will grow and encreaſe
upon us, inſomuch, that we ſhall not
dare to ſtir out of our Habitations; nay, it
will be well if they arrive not to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
of plundering our Houſes at
Noon day.</p>
               <p>Where is the Courage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation, that a Gentleman, with Six or
Seven Servants, ſhall be robb'd by one
ſingle Highwayman? Yet we have lately
had Inſtances of this; and for this we may
thank our Effeminacy, our Toupee Wigs,
and powder'd Pates, our Tea, and other
ſcandalous Fopperies; and above all, the
Diſuſe of noble and manly Sports, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to a brave People, once in Vogue,
but now totally loſt among us.</p>
               <p>Let not the Reader think I run from

Let the Watch be compoſed of ſtout
able bodied Men, and of thoſe at leaſt
treble the Number now ſubſiſting, that
is to ſay, a Watchman to every Forty
Houſes, Twenty on one Side of the Way,
and Twenty on the other; for it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
that a Man cannot well ſee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
beyond the Extent of Twenty
Houſes in a Row; if 'tis a ſingle Row,
and no oppoſite Houſes, the Charge muſt
be greater, and their Safety leſs. This
Man ſhould be elected, and paid by the
Houſekeepers themſelves, to prevent Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application
and Abuſe, ſo much complain'd
of, in the Diſtribution of Publick Money.</p>
               <p>He ſhould be allow'd 10<hi>s. per Annum,</hi>
by each Houſekeeper, which at Forty
Houſes, as above ſpecify'd, amounts to
20<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> almoſt treble to what is
at preſent allow'd; and yet moſt Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers
are charg'd at leaſt 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> a
Quarter to the Watch, whoſe beat is, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſpeaking, little leſs than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs

               <p>This Salary is ſomething of Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a pretty Settlement to a poor
Man, who, with Frugality, may live de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
thereon, and, by due Reſt, be
enabled to give vigilant Attendance.</p>
               <p>If a Houſekeeper break, or a Houſe is
empty, the poor Watchman ought not to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0316800100:52"/>
ſuffer, the Deficiency ſhould be made up
by the Houſekeepers remaining.</p>
               <p>Or, indeed, all Houſekeepers might be
excus'd, if a Tax of only 1<hi>s. per Annum</hi>
were levied on every Batchelor within the
Bills of Mortality, and above the Age of
One and Twenty, who is not a Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper;
for theſe young Sparks are a
Kind of unprofitable Gentry to the State;
they claim publick Safety and Advantages,
and yet pay nothing to the Publick, nay
indeed, they, in a Manner, live upon the
Publick, for (on a <hi>Sunday</hi> eſpecially) at
leaſt a Million of theſe Gentlemen quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves upon the married Men,
and rob many Families of part of a Week's
Proviſion, more particularly when they
play a good Knife and Fork, and are of
the Family of the <hi>Tuckers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beg Pardon for this whimſical Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
which, ludicrous as it ſeems, has
ſomething in it; and may be improved.
Return we, in the mean Time, to our
Subject.</p>
               <p>The Watch thus ſtation'd, ſtrengthen'd,
and encourag'd, let every Watchman be
arm'd with Fire-Arms and Sword; and
let no Watchman ſtand above Twenty
Doors diſtant from his Fellow.</p>
               <p>Let each Watchman be provided with
a Bugle-Horn, to ſound on Alarm, or in
Time of Danger; and let it be made pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0316800100:53"/>
if not Felony, for any but a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to ſound a Horn in and about the
City, from the Time of their going on,
to that of their going off.</p>
               <p>An Objection will be here made on
Account of the Poſt-Boys, to obviate
which, I had Thoughts of a Bell, but
that would be too ponderous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
for a Watchman to carry, beſides
his Arms and Lanthorn. As to a fix'd
Bell, if the Watchman is at another Part
of his Walk, how can he give Notice?
Beſides, Rogues may play Tricks
with the Bell; whereas a Horn is portable,
always ready, and moſt alarming.</p>
               <p>Let the Poſt-Boys, therefore, uſe ſome
other Signal, ſince this is moſt convenient
to this more material Purpoſe. They
may carry a Bell in a Holſter, with Eaſe,
and give Notice by that, as well as thoſe
who collect the Letters.</p>
               <p>That the Watchmen may ſee from one
End of their Walks to the other, let a
convenient Number of Lamps be ſet up,
and thoſe not of the Convex Kind, which
blind the Eyes, and are of no manner of
Uſe; they dazzle, but give no diſtinct
Light: And farther, rather than prevent
Robberies. Many, deceiv'd and blinded
by theſe <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> have been run over
by Coaches, Carts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> People ſtumble
more upon one another, even under theſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0316800100:54"/>
very Lamps, than in the Dark. In ſhort,
they are moſt unprofitable Lights, and,
in my Opinion, rather Abuſes than Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>
               <p>Beſides,
I ſee no Reaſon why every Ten
Houſekeepers can't find a Lamp among
themſelves, and let their Watchman dreſs
it, rather than fatten a crew of Directors:
But we are ſo fond of Companies, 'tis a
Wonder we have not our Shooes black'd
by one, and a Set of Directors made rich
at the Expence of our very Black-guards.
Convenient Turn-pikes and Stoppages
may be made to prevent Eſcapes, and it
will be proper for a Watchman to be
plac'd at one of theſe, fix'd at the End of
a Lane, Court, Alley, or other Thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
which may happen in any Part of
his Beat, and ſo as not to obſtruct his
View to both Ends thereof, or being able
to give Notice, as aforeſaid; for the
Watch ought to be in View, as well as in
the Hearing of each other, or they may
be overpower'd, and much Danger may
happen.</p>
               <p>The Streets thus guarded and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
what remains, but that the Money
allotted by the Government be inſtantly
paid on Conviction of every Offender;
for Delays in this Caſe are of dangerous
Conſequence, and no Body will venture
their Lives in Hopes of a Reward, if it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0316800100:55"/>
be not duly and timely paid. If there is
Reaſon of Complaint on this Head, it
ought to be look'd into by thoſe at the
Helm; for nothing can be more vile than
for Underlings to abuſe the Benevolence
of the Publick, or their Superiors, by ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
abridging, or delaying publick or
private Benefits. And it is by no Means
below the Dignity, or Care, even of the
greateſt, to ſee the Diſpoſal of their own
Bounty and Charity; for it loſes but too
often by the Carriage: And where a
Nobleman, or other generous Perſon, has
order'd Five Guineas to be given, 'tis well
if the proper Object has had even One.</p>
               <p>Something allow'd by the Chamber of
<hi>London,</hi> to every Perſon apprehending a
Robber, would have a good Effect, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if it be not told over a Gridiron,
but paid without Delay, or Abatement.
And what if the fewer Cuſtards are eat, ſo
it augment the Publick Safety.</p>
               <p>Some of our common Soldiery are (and
I hope unjuſtly) ſuſpected. This may be
eaſily confuted, if ſtrict Orders are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd,
that none but Commiſſion, or
Warrant Officers ſhall be out of their
Quarters after Ten at Night. But if we
conſider, that neither <hi>Blewit, Bunworth,</hi>
or their Gangs, were Soldiers, and that of
thoſe who have been executed for Ten
Years paſt, not One in Ten were Soldiers,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0316800100:56"/>
but, on the contrary, Seamen diſcharg'd,
and thrown on the Publick, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Subſiſtence, which made them deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate:
But I hope the Act now depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Encouragement of Seamen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
will ſufficiently remove that Obſtacle alſo.
This, I hope, will ſtop the Mouths of
cenſorious Perſons, who unjuſtly arraign
our Soldiery for the Vices of others:
However, to make all eaſy, I believe the
Generality of them will gladly ſubmit to
the Reſtraint propos'd, merely to ſhow
their Innocence.</p>
               <p>Mean Time, would his moſt ſacred
Majeſty let them partake of his Bounty,
as the Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have done, and raiſe
their Pay, were it but One Penny <hi>per
Diem,</hi> it would be a moſt Royal Bounty,
would conſiderably contribute to their
Support, and put them above any ſordid
Views: And there was never more Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
than now, when Proviſions of all

               <p>Having offer'd my little Mite to the
Publick, I beg they will excuſe the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of my Stile, and Multitude of my
Errors, for my Intention's Sake. I write
without Proſpect of Gain: If I am cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
'tis what I can but expect; but if,
among all my Schemes, One proves of
Service, my Deſires and Labours are
amply anſwer'd.</p>

               <p>IN my Scheme for an Univerſity in
<hi>London,</hi> I propoſed only a Hall or
publick Room; on Recollection I find it
ſhould be a large Houſe or Inn, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a College, with ſtore of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Rooms for Gentlemen, not only to
ſtudy ſeparately, but wherein to lodge
their Books, for 'twould be moſt inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to lug them backwards and forwards:
They may indeed Breakfaſt, Sup, and Sleep
at Home, but 'twill be highly neceſſary
they ſhould dine in Commons, or at leaſt
near the College; not that I would have
Cooks, Butlers, Caterers, Manciples, and
the whole Train of College Cannibals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
but for fear they ſhould ſtay too
long at Home, or be hindred from return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Study in due time, ſome proper
Place or Perſon might be pitch'd upon to
keep an Ordinary at a prefix'd Price and
Hour, and for the Students only.</p>
               <p>My Reaſons are theſe:<list>
                     <item>Firſt, A young Gentleman may live too
far from College.</item>
                     <item>Second, The College Hours for Dinner,
may not agree with thoſe of the Family.</item>

him.</item>
                  </list> Theſe being, I think, the only mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Objections could be offered, I hope I
have amply provided againſt them, and
rendered my Project more perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable.</p>
               <p>One
Omiſſion I made in the Diſcourſe on
Mad-Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is, that Maiden Ladies
as well as Widows and Wives, are liable
to the Inquiſition there complained of,
and I am inform'd a good Eſtate is lately
come to a worthleſs Family, by the Death,
or rather Murder of an innocent young
Creature, who being left very rich, choſe
to live with her Friends; but well had it
been for her, had ſhe taken up her Abode
among Strangers, for they ſtay'd off all
Propoſals for Marriage a conſiderable time,
and when at laſt they found the Lady
would not be hindered from altering her
Condition, ſhe was hurried away to a
Mad-Houſe, where ſhe miſerably ended
her Days, while they rioted in the Pillage
of her Fortune. Thus neither Maid,
Wife or Widdow, are ſafe, while theſe
accurſed Mad-Houſes are ſuffered: Nay, I
ſee no Reaſon, (if the Age improves in
Wickedneſs, as in all Probability it may)
but the Men, <hi>per Contra,</hi> may take their
Turns. Younger Brothers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may clap
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0316800100:59"/>
up their Elders and jump into their Eſtates,
for there are no Queſtions ask'd at theſe
Mad-Houſes, but who is the Pay-maſter,
and how much; give them but their
Price, mad or not mad 'tis no matter
whom they confine; ſo that if any Perſon
lives longer than his Relations think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
they know their Remedy, 'tis
but ſending them to a Mad-Houſe and
the Eſtate's their own.</p>
               <p>Having anſwer'd all that I think liable
to Objection, and recollected what I had
omitted, I deſire to ſtand or fall by the
Judgment of the ſerious Part of Mankind;
wherein they ſhall correct me I will kiſs
the Rod and ſuffer with Patience; but if
a pack of Hackney Scriblers ſhall attack
me only by way of a get-Penny, I ſhall
not be provoked to anſwer them be they
never ſo ſcurrilous, leſt I be accounted as
one of them.</p>

            <head>TO
Lieutenant-Colonel
<hi>Samuel Robinſon.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall congratulate you on your Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into the Chamberlainſhip of the
City of <hi>London,</hi> or otherwiſe, as you ſhall
acquit your ſelf in anſwering candidly and
impartially to the following Queries.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Whether there is not Money ſufficient
in the Chamber of <hi>London</hi> to pay off the
Orphan's Fund? Or if not a ſufficient Sum,
What Sum it is, and what is the Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency?
How long it has lain there, and
what Intereſt has been made upon it?</item>
               <item>II. If there are not conſiderable Arrears
due from many Wards, and what thoſe
Arrears are?</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0316800100:61"/>
III. Who are theſe poor Orphans we pay
ſo much Money to? And whether they
are not ſome of the richeſt Men in the City
of <hi>London,</hi> who have got the Stock into
their own Hands, and find it ſo ſnug a
Fund, they do not care to get out of it?</item>
               <item>IV. If it would not be much better to
gather in the Arrears, join 'em to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in the Office, and collect the Overplus
at once, rather than ſuffer the Tax to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
eternal, and to pay ſo much Intereſt?</item>
            </list>
            <p>This is but a reaſonable Requeſt; and
if Col. <hi>Robinſon</hi> is the honeſt Gentleman
Fame reports him to be, he will make no
Scruple to give a ready Anſwer. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it will be but a handſome Return
made to his Fellow Citizens, for their
Choice of him, to begin his Office with
ſuch an Act of Juſtice, Honeſty, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Satisfaction. For many People don't
know what is meant by the Orphan's Tax:
They pay it with Remorſe, and think
themſelves aggrieved. Even thoſe who
know the Reaſon of the Fund think it has
been continued long enough, wiſh it were
once paid off, ſuſpect ſome Secret in the
Affair, and give their Tongues the Liberty
all Loſers claim: <hi>Our Fathers,</hi> ſay they,
<hi>have eaten four Grapes, and our Teeth are
ſet on Edge, we are viſited for their
Tranſgreſſions, and may be to the World's</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0316800100:62"/>
               <hi>End, unleſs we find an honeſt Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
who will unveil this cloudy Affair,
and give us a Proſpect of Relief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, it lies at your Door to gain
the Applauſe of the whole City (a few
Miſers excepted) by a generous and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-like
Diſcovery of this Affair. And
you are thus publickly call'd upon, that
your Diſcovery may be as publick and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to all. If you comply, I ſhall think
you an honeſt Man, above a Fellow-feeling,
or being byaſs'd, and moſt worthy your
Office: If not, give me Leave to think,
the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> have made but an
indifferent Choice. I am,</p>
