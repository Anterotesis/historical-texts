            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following petite piece, which is taken from Marmontel, was originally acted at Dr. Lane's Theatre, in the year 1775. It had then the good fortune of having its principal character repreſented by that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed actreſs Mrs. Abington, who has ſince very frequently performed the ſame on Covent Garden Stage. A new candidate for fame having undertaken to appear in this very agreeable and lively part; and the piece being often called for; it has been thought proper to give the Public an opportunity of peruſing in the cloſet what has ſo long delighted on the ſtage.</p>

               <p>As Solyman I do, but not as emperor of the Turks—nor will I ever conſent to aſcend his bed at night, at whoſe feet I muſt fall in the morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sul.</speaker>
               <p>If it depended upon nie, Roxalana, I ſwear by our holy prophet, that I ſhould be happy in calling you my queen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rox.</speaker>
               <p>That's a poor excuſe.—Had the man I lov'd but a cottage, I would gladly partake it with him; would ſooth his vexations, and ſoften his cares: but, were he maſter of a throne, I ſhould expect to ſhare it with him, or he has no love for me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sul.</speaker>
               <p>Or if you will wait, perhaps time will bring it about.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rox.</speaker>
               <p>Wait, indeed! No, Sir!—Your wife, or humble ſervant—My reſolution is fix'd—fix yours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sul.</speaker>
               <p>But an emperor of the Turks—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Rox.</speaker>
               <p>May do as he pleaſes, and ſhould be deſpotic ſometimes on the ſide of reaſon and virtue.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sul.</speaker>
               <p>Then there is our law—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rox.</speaker>
               <p>Which is monſtrous and abſurd.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Rox.</speaker>
               <p>Are your ſlaves—Set them a good example.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rox.</speaker>
               <p>The people!—are they to govern you? Make the people happy, and they will not prevent your being ſo. They would be pleaſed to ſee you raiſe to the throne one that you love, and would love you, and be beloved by your people. Should ſhe interpoſe in behalf of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, relieve the diſtreſſed by her munificence and diffuſe happineſs through the palace, ſhe would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd—ſhe would be ador'd—ſhe'd be like the queen of the country from where I came.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sul.</speaker>
               <p>It is enough—my ſcruples are at an end—my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, like clouds before the riſing ſun, vaniſh before the lights of your ſuperior reaſon—My love is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a ſoible—you are worthy of empire.</p>

            </head>
            <l>LORD, how I tremble! every atom ſhaking.</l>
            <l>What! ſpeak an Epilogue of my own making!</l>
            <l>A taſk for me—preſumptuous and abſurd—</l>
            <l>But I have promis'd, and muſt keep my word.</l>
            <l>Yes, I did promiſe, with a ſolemn face,</l>
            <l>Tadareſs my patrons here, and ſue for grace;</l>
            <l>For your paſt favours had ſo warm'd my heart,</l>
            <l>I thought to tell them needed little art.</l>
            <l>How vain the thought! for pondering day and night,</l>
            <l>I found, though I might ſpeak, I cou'd not write.</l>
            <l>Diſtreſſ'd, to Garrick then I fly for aid:</l>
            <l>You can aſſiſt me, Sir, for wit's your trade.</l>
            <l>When of your epilogues I ſpeak a line,</l>
            <l>Each ſide-box cries, Oh charming, vaſtly fine,</l>
            <l>Its quite delightful, monſtrouſly divine!</l>
            <l>The pit, alive to every comic ſtroke,</l>
            <l>With laughter loud anticipates the joke:</l>
            <l>All but the modern fop, to feeling dead,</l>
            <l>With heart of adamant and brains of lead,</l>
            <l>Languid and lifeleſs, lolling, yawns, takes ſnuff;</l>
            <l>And cries, As gad's my judge 'tis flimſy ſtuff.</l>
            <l>Heaven knows I monſtrouſly abhor a play,</l>
            <l>It's a <hi>vile bore—</hi>what dragg'd me here to-day?</l>
            <l>Dear lady Mary, how can you attend?</l>
            <l>Will Garrick's nonſenſe never have an end?</l>
            <l>Not ſo, <hi>Sir</hi> Mac, who juſt has croſs'd the Tweed,</l>
            <l>Cries, Vary weel, ridiculous indeed!</l>
            <l>The cheeld has parts; ah, he'd been muckle keen,</l>
            <l>If bred at Glaſgow, or at Aberdeen!</l>
            <l>Sir Paddy lays, "My jewel, that's mighty pretty:</l>
            <l>"Faith Garrick, you were once in Dublin city;</l>
            <l>"In ſweet Smock-alley, you have cut a figure,</l>
            <l>"Oh, you'd be great were you a little bigger."</l>
            <l>Thus na ions, parties, all in this agree:</l>
            <l>And humour's palm, oh Garrick! yield to thee:</l>
            <l>Then, good Sir, ſcribble ſomething new for me.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:1182701400:22"/>
To Garrick thus in flattering ſtrains I ſue,</l>
            <l>But all in vain, nor prayers nor flattery do.</l>
            <l>Since thus <hi>obdurate,</hi> all their aid refuſe,</l>
            <l>I, a mere novice, muſt invoke the Muſe.</l>
            <l>Oh would immortal Shakeſpear's <hi>muſe</hi> of <hi>fire,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Heave in my breaſt, each <hi>kindling</hi> thought inſpire;</l>
            <l>Or cou'd I mount on the Moeonian wing,</l>
            <l>Or chant ſuch ſongs as <hi>raptur'd</hi> Seraphs ſing;</l>
            <l>To you, my kind protectors, wou'd I raiſe</l>
            <l>My fulleſt, loudeſt, warmeſt notes of praiſe:</l>
            <l>The great, the brave, the fair, who now appear</l>
            <l>In bright array to grace this circle here,</l>
            <l>My Muſe to late ſtages ſhould proclaim,</l>
            <l>Their worth record, and conſecrate their fame;</l>
            <l>While gratitude on <hi>rapturous</hi> pinions ſoars,</l>
            <l>And echoes loud the virtues ſhe adores.</l>
