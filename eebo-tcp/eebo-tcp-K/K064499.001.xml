            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HONOURABLE AND RIGHT REVEREND JAMES YORK, D. D.</head>
            <head type="sub">LORD BISHOP OF ELY.</head>
            <p>MY LORD,</p>
            <p>WHEN five years ago an important ſtation in the Univerſity of Cambridge awaited your Lordſhip's diſpoſal, you were pleaſed to offer it to me. The circumſtances, under which this offer was made, demand a public acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement. I had never ſeen your Lordſhip: I poſſeſſed no connection which could poſſibly recommend me to your favour: I was known to you, only by my endeavours, in common with
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0270800301:6"/>
many others, to diſcharge my duty as a tutor in the Univerſity; and by ſome very imperfect, but certainly well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and, as you thought, uſeful pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications ſince. In an age by no means wanting in examples oſ honourable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, although this deſerve not to be mentioned, in reſpect of the object of your Lordſhip's choice, it is inferior to none, in the purity and diſintereſtedneſs of the motives which ſuggeſted it.</p>
            <p>How the following work may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, I pretend not to foretell. My firſt prayer concerning it is, that it may do good to any: my ſecond hope, that it may aſſiſt, what it hath always been my earneſt wiſh to promote, the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious part of an academical education. If in this latter view it might ſeem, in any degree, to excuſe your Lordſhip's
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0270800301:7"/>
judgment of its author, I ſhall be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the reflection, that, to a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs flowing from public principles, I have made the beſt public return in my power.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, and in every event, I rejoice in the opportunity here afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, of teſtifying the ſenſe I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of your Lordſhip's conduct, and of a notice which I regard, as the moſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering diſtinction of my life.</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>I am, My Lord, With ſentiments of gratitude and reſpect, Your Lordſhip's faithful, And moſt obliged ſervant,W. PALEY.</signed>

            <p>I DEEM it unneceſſary to prove that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſtood in need of a revelation, becauſe I have met with no ſerious perſon who thinks that even under the Chriſtian revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have too much light, or any degree of aſſurance which is ſuperfluous. I deſire moreover that in judging of Chriſtianity it may be remembered, that the queſtion lies between this religion and none: for if the Chriſtian religion be not credible, no one, with whom we have to do, will ſupport the pretenſions of any other.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then the world we live in to have had a Creator; ſuppoſe it to appear from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0270800301:13"/>
the predominant aim and tendency of the proviſions and contrivances obſervable in the univerſe, that the Deity, when he formed it, conſulted for the happineſs of his ſenſitive creation; ſuppoſe the diſpoſition which die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated this council to continue: ſuppoſe a part of the creation to have received faculties from their Maker, by which they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of rendering a moral obedience to his will, and of voluntarily purſuing any end for which he has deſigned them; ſuppoſe the Creator to intend for theſe his rational and accountable agents a ſecond ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, in which their ſituation will be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by their behaviour in the firſt ſtate, by which ſuppoſition (and by no other) the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Divine government in not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a difference between the good and the bad, and the inconſiſtency of this confuſion with the care and benevolence diſcoverable in the works of the Deity is done away; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be of the utmoſt importance to the ſubjects of this diſpenſation to know what is intended f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

happineſs of the ſpecies, a purpoſe which ſo many proviſions of nature are calculated to promote: Suppoſe, nevertheleſs, almoſt the whole race, either by the imperfection of their faculties, the misfortune of their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, or by the loſs of ſome prior revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to want this knowledge, and not to be likely without the aid of a new revelation to attain it; under theſe circumſtances is it improbable that a revelation ſhould be made? Is it incredible that God ſhould interpoſe for ſuch a purpoſe? Suppoſe him to deſign for mankind a future ſtate, is it unlikely that he ſhould acquaint them with it?</p>
            <p>Now in what way can a revelation be made but by miracles? In none which we are able to conceive. Conſequently in whatever degree it is probable or not very improbable that a revelation ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to mankind at all, in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is it probable or not very improbable that miracles ſhould be wrought. Therefore when miracles are related to have been wrought in the promulgating of a revelation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0270800301:15"/>
manifeſtly wanted, and, if true, of ineſtimable value, the improbability which ariſes from the miraculous nature of the things related, is not greater than the original im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability that ſuch a revelation ſhould be imparted by God.</p>
            <p>I wiſh it however to be correctly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, in what manner, and to what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, this argument is alledged. We do not aſſume the attributes of the Deity, or the exiſtence of a future ſtate, in order to <hi>prove</hi> the reality of miracles. That reality al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways muſt be proved by evidence. We aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert only that in miracles adduced in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of revelation, there is not any ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent improbability as no teſtimony can ſurmount. And, for the purpoſe of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this aſſertion, we contend, that the incredibility of miracles related to have been wrought in atteſtation of a meſſage from God, conveying intelligence of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, and teaching mankind how to prepare themſelves for that ſtate, is not in itſelf greater than the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0270800301:16"/>
event, call it either probable or improbable, of the two following propoſitions being true; namely, firſt, that a future ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence ſhould be deſtined by God for his human creation, and ſecondly, that, being ſo deſtined, he ſhould acquaint them with it. It is not neceſſary for our purpoſe that theſe propoſitions be capable of proof, or even that, by arguments drawn from the light of nature, they can be made out to be probable. It is enough that we are able to ſay concerning them, that they are not ſo violently improbable, ſo contradictory to what we already believe of the Divine power and character, that either the propoſitions themſelves, or facts ſtrictly connected with the propoſitions, (and therefore no farther improbable than they are improbable) ought to be rejected at firſt ſight, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by whatever ſtrength or complication of evidence they be atteſted.</p>
            <p>This is the prejudication we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. For to this length does a modern ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to miracles go, viz. that no human
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0270800301:17"/>
teſtimony can in any caſe render them cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. I think the reflection above ſtated, that, if there be a revelation, there muſt be miracles; and that, under the circumſtances in which the human ſpecies are placed, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is not improbable, or not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in any great degree, to be a fair anſwer to the whole objection.</p>
            <p>But ſince it is an objection which ſtands in the very threſhold of our argument, and, if admitted, is a bar to every proof, and to all future reaſoning upon the ſubject, it may be neceſſary, before we proceed farther, to examine the principle upon which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to be founded: which principle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely this, that it is contrary to experience that a miracle ſhould be true, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to experience that teſtimony ſhould be falſe.</p>
            <p>Now there appears a ſmall ambiguity in the term "experience," and in the phraſes "contrary to experience," or "contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experience," which it may be neceſſary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0270800301:18"/>
to remove in the firſt place. Strictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the narrative of a fact is <hi>then</hi> only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to experience, when the fact is related to have exiſted at a time and place, at which time and place we being preſent, did not perceive it to exiſt; as if it ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that in a particular room, and at a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular hour of a certain day, a man was raiſed from the dead, in which room, and at the time ſpecified, we being preſent and looking on, perceived no ſuch event to have taken place. Here the aſſertion is contrary to experience properly ſo called; and this is a contrariety which no evidence can ſurmount. It matters nothing, whether the fact be of a miraculous nature or not. But although this be the experience, and the contrariety, which Archbiſhop Tillotſon alledged in the quotation with which Mr. Hume opens his eſſay, it is certainly not that experience, nor that contrariety, which Mr. Hume himſelf intended to object. And, ſhort of this, I know no intelligible ſignification which can be affixed to the term "contrary to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience," but one, viz. that of not having
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0270800301:19"/>
ourſelves experienced any thing ſimilar to the thing related, or ſuch things not being generally experienced by others. I ſay not "generally," for to ſtate concerning the fact in queſtion, that no ſuch thing was <hi>ever</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, or that <hi>univerſal</hi> experience is againſt it, is to aſſume the ſubject of the controverſy.</p>
            <p>Now the improbability which ariſes from the want (for this properly is a want, not a contradiction) of experience, is only equal to the probability there is, that if the thing were true, we ſhould experience things ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to it, or that ſuch things would be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally experienced. Suppoſe it then to be true that miracles were wrought upon the firſt promulgation of Chriſtianity, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but miracles could decide its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is it certain that ſuch miracles would be repeated ſo often, and in ſo many places, as to become objects of general experience? Is it a probability approaching to certainty? Is it a probability of any great ſtrength or force? Is it ſuch as no evidence can encounter?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0270800301:20"/>
and yet this probability is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <hi>converſe,</hi> and therefore the exact mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the improbability which ariſes from the want of experience, and which Mr. Hume repreſents as invincible by human teſtimony.</p>
            <p>It is not like alledging a new law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or a new experiment in natural philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, becauſe, when theſe are related, it is expected that, under the ſame circumſtances, the ſame effect will follow univerſally; and in proportion as this expectation is juſtly entertained, the want of a correſponding experience negatives the hiſtory. But to expect concerning a miracle that it ſhould ſucceed upon repetition, is to expect that which would make it ceaſe to be a miracle, which is contrary to its nature as ſuch, and would totally deſtroy the uſe and purpoſe for which it was wrought.</p>
            <p>The force of experience as an objection to miracles is founded in the preſumption, either that the courſe of nature is invariable,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0270800301:21"/>
or that, iſ it be ever varied, variations will be frequent and general. Has the neceſſity of this alternative been demonſtrated? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to call the courſe of nature the agency of an intelligent Being, and is there any good reaſon for judging this ſtate of the caſe to be probable? Ought we not rather to expect, that ſuch a Being, upon occaſions of peculiar importance, may interrupt the order which he had appointed, yet, that ſuch occaſions ſhould return ſeldom; that theſe interruptions conſequently ſhould be conſined to the experience of a ſew; that the want of it, therefore, in many, ſhould be matter neither of ſurpriſe nor objection?</p>
            <p>But as a continuation of the argument from experience it is ſaid, that, when we advance accounts of miracles, we aſſign ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects without cauſes, or we attribute effects to cauſes inadequate to the purpoſe, or to cauſes of the operation of which we have no experience. Of what cauſes, we may aſk, and of what effects does the objection ſpeak? If it be anſwered that, when we aſcribe the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0270800301:22"/>
cure of the palſy to a touch, of blindneſs to the anointing of the eyes with clay, or the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the dead to a word, we lay ourſelves open to this imputation, we reply that we aſcribe no ſuch effects to ſuch cauſes. We perceive no virtue or energy in theſe things more than in other things of the ſame kind. They are merely ſigns to connect the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle with its end. The effect we aſcribe ſimply to the volition of the Deity; of whoſe exiſtence and power, not to ſay of whoſe preſence and agency, we have previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and independent proof. We have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all we ſeek for in the works of rational agents, a ſufficient power and an adequate motive. In a word, once believe that there is a God, and miracles are not incredible.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hume ſtates the caſe of miracles to be a conteſt of oppoſite improbabilities, that is to ſay, a queſtion whether it be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that the miracle ſhould be true, or the teſtimony falſe; and this I think a fair account of the controverſy. But herein I remark a want of argumentative juſtice, that,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0270800301:23"/>
in deſcribing the improbability of miracles, he ſuppreſſes all thoſe circumſtances of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation, which reſult from our knowledge of the exiſtence, power, and diſpoſition of the Deity, his concern in the creation, the end anſwered by the miracle, the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that end, and its ſubſerviency to the plan purſued in the works of nature. As Mr. Hume has repreſented the queſtion, miracles are alike incredible to him who is previouſly aſſured of the conſtant agency of a divine Being, and to him who believes that no ſuch Being exiſts in the univerſe. They are equally incredible, whether related to have been wrought upon occaſions the moſt deſerving, and for purpoſes the moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, or for no aſſignable end whatever, or for an end confeſſedly trifling or pernicious. This ſurely cannot be a correct ſtatement. In adjuſting alſo the other ſide of the balance, the ſtrength and weight of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, this author has provided an anſwer to every poſſible accumulation of hiſtorical proof by telling us, that we are not obliged to explain how the ſtory or the evidence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0270800301:24"/>
aroſe. Now I think that we <hi>are</hi> obliged; not, perhaps, to ſhew by poſitive accounts how it did, but by a probable hypotheſis how it might ſo happen. The exiſtence of the teſtimony is a phenomenon. The truth of the fact ſolves the phenomenon. If we reject this ſolution we ought to have ſome other to reſt in; and none even by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries can be admitted, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the principles that regulate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs and human conduct at preſent, or which makes men <hi>them</hi> to have been a different kind of beings from what they are now.</p>
            <p>But the ſhort conſideration which, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of every other, convinces me that there is no ſolid foundation in Mr. Hume's concluſion is the following. When a theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem is propoſed to a mathematician, the firſt thing he does with it is to try it upon a ſimple caſe; and, if it produce a falſe reſult, he is ſure that there muſt be ſome miſtake in the demonſtration. Now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this way with what may be called
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0270800301:25"/>
Mr. Hume's theorem. If twelve men, whoſe probity and good ſenſe I had long known, ſhould ſeriouſly and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially relate to me an account of a miracle wrought before their eyes, and in which it was impoſſible that they ſhould be deceived; if the governor of the country, hearing a rumour of this account, ſhould call theſe men into his preſence, and offer them a ſhort propoſal, either to confeſs the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſubmit to be tied up to a gibbet; if they ſhould refuſe with one voice to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that there exiſted any falſehood or impoſture in the caſe; if this threat were communicated to them ſeparately, yet with no different effect; if it was at laſt executed; if I myſelf ſaw them, one after another, conſenting to be racked, burnt, or ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, rather than give up the truth of their account; ſtill, if Mr. Hume's rule be my guide, I am not to believe them. Now I undertake to ſay that there exiſts not a ſceptic in the world who would not believe them; or who would defend ſuch incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0270800301:26"/>
Inſtances of ſpurious miracles ſupported by ſtrong apparent teſtimony undoubtedly demand examination. Mr. Hume has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to fortiſy his argument by ſome examples of this kind. I hope in a proper place to ſhow that none of them reach the ſtrength or circumſtances of the Chriſtian evidence. In theſe however conſiſts the weight of his objection. In the principle itſelf I am perſuaded there is none.</p>

            <p n="1">I.

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0270800301:28"/>
II. That there is <hi>not</hi> ſatisfactory evidence that perſons profeſſing to be original wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of other miracles, in their nature as certain as theſe are, have ever acted in the ſame manner, in atteſtation of the accounts which they delivered, and properly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their belief of thoſe accounts.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe propoſitions, as it forms the argument, will ſtand at the head of the following <hi>nine</hi> chapters.</p>

               <div n="1" type="chapter">

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">There is ſatisfactory evidence that many, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to be original witneſſes of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian miracles, paſſed their lives in labours, dangers and ſufferings, voluntarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in atteſtation of the accounts which they delivered, and ſolely in conſequence of their belief of thoſe accounts; and that they alſo ſubmitted from the ſame motives to new rules of conduct.</head>
                  <p>To ſupport this propoſition two points are neceſſary to be made out: firſt, that the founder of the inſtitution, his aſſociates and immediate followers, acted the part which the propoſition imputes to them: ſecondly, that they did ſo, in atteſtation of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous hiſtory recorded in our ſcriptures, and ſolely in conſequence of their belief of the truth of this hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Before we produce any particular teſtimony
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0270800301:30"/>
to the activity and ſufferings which compoſe the ſubject of our firſt aſſertion, it will be proper to conſider the degree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability which the aſſertion derives from the <hi>nature of the caſe,</hi> that is, by inferences from thoſe parts of the caſe which, in point of fact, are on all hands acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the Chriſtian religion exiſts, and therefore by ſome means or other was eſtabliſhed. Now it either owes the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of its eſtabliſhment, <hi>i. e.</hi> its firſt publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the activity of the perſon who was the founder of the inſtitution, and of thoſe who were joined with him in the undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or we are driven upon the ſtrange ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that, although they might lie by, others would take it up; although they were quiet and ſilent, other perſons buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſucceſs and propagation of their ſtory. This is perfectly incredible. To me it appears little leſs than certain, that, if the firſt announcing of the religion by the founder had not been followed up by the zeal and induſtry of his immediate diſciples,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0270800301:31"/>
the attempt muſt have expired in its birth. Then as to the kind and degree of exertion which was employed, and the mode of life to which theſe perſons ſubmitted, we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſe it to be like that, which we obſerve in all others who voluntarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miſſionaries of a new faith. Frequent, earneſt and laborious preaching, conſtantly converſing with religious perſons upon reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a ſequeſtration from the common pleaſures, engagements and varieties of life, and an addiction to one ſerious object, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the habits of ſuch men. I do not ſay that this mode of life is without enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I ſay that the enjoyment ſprings from ſincerity. With a conſciouſneſs at the bottom of hollowneſs and falſehood, the fatigue and reſtraint would become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable. I am apt to believe that very few hypocrites engage in theſe undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; or, however, perſiſt in them long. Ordinarily ſpeaking, nothing can overcome the indolence of mankind, the love which is natural to moſt tempers of chearful ſociety and chearful ſcenes, or the deſire, which is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0270800301:32"/>
common to all, of perſonal eaſe and freedom, but conviction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is alſo highly probable, from the nature of the caſe, that the propagation of the new religion was attended with diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and danger. As addreſſed to the Jews it was a ſyſtem, adverſe not only to their habitual opinions, but to thoſe opinions upon which their hopes, their partialities, their pride, their conſolation was founded. This people, with or without reaſon, had worked themſelves into a perſuaſion, that ſome ſignal and greatly advantageous change was to be effected in the condition of their country, by the agency of a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſed meſſenger from heaven <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>"Pererebuerat oriente toto vetus et conſtans opinio, eſſe in fatis, ut eo tempore Judaeâ profecti rerum poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur." Sueton. Ves;paſian. cap. 4—8.</p>
                        <p>"Pluribus perſuaſio inerat, antiquis ſacerdotum lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris contineri, co ipſo tempore ſore, ut valeſceret oriens, proſectique Judaeâ rerum potirentur," Tacit. Hiſt. lib. v. cap. 9—13.</p>
                     </note>. The rulers of the Jews, their leading ſect, their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0270800301:33"/>
prieſthood had been the authors of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion to the common people. So that it was not merely the conjecture of theoretical divines, or the ſecret expectation of a few recluſe devotees, but it was become the popular hope and paſſion, and, like all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular opinions, undoubting, and impatient of contradiction. They clung to this hope under every misfortune of their country, and with more tenacity as their dangers or calamities increaſed. To find therefore that expectations ſo gratifying were to be worſe than diſappointed; that they were to end in the diffuſion of a mild unambitious reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which, inſtead of victories and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, inſtead of exalting their nation and inſtitution above the reſt of the world, was to advance thoſe whom they deſpiſed to an equality with themſelves, in thoſe very points of compariſon in which they moſt valued their own diſtinction, could be no very pleaſing diſcovery to a Jewiſh mind; nor could the meſſengers of ſuch intelligence expect to be well received or eaſily credited. The doctrine was equally harſh and novel.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0270800301:34"/>
The extending of the kingdom of God to thoſe who did not conform to the law of Moſes, was a notion that had never before entered into the thoughts of a Jew.</p>
                  <p>The character of the new inſtitution was, in other reſpects alſo, ungrateful to Jewiſh habits and principles. Their own religion was in a high degree technical. Even the enlightened Jew placed a great deal of ſtreſs upon the ceremonies of his law, ſaw in them a great deal of virtue and efficacy; the groſs and vulgar had ſcarcely any thing elſe; and the hypocritical and oſtentatious magnified them above meaſure, as being the inſtruments of their own reputation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. The Chriſtian ſcheme, without formally repealing the Levitical code, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered its eſtimation extremely. In the place of ſtrictneſs and zeal in performing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances which that code preſcribed, or which tradition had added to it, the new ſect preached up faith, well-regulated affections, inward purity and moral rectitude of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as the true ground, on the part of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0270800301:35"/>
worſhlpper, of merit and acceptance with God. This, however rational it may appear, or recommending to us at preſent, did not by any means facilitate the plan then. On the contrary, to diſparage thoſe qualities which the higheſt characters in the country valued themſelves moſt upon, was a ſure way of making powerful enemies. As if the fruſtration of the national hope was not enough, the long-eſteemed merit of ritual zeal and punctuality was to be decried, and that by Jews preaching to Jews.</p>
                  <p>The ruling party at Jeruſalem had juſt before crucified the founder of the religion. That is a fact which will not be diſputed. They therefore who ſtood forth to preach the religion, muſt neceſſarily reproach theſe rulers with an execution, which they could not but repreſent as an unjuſt and cruel murder. This would not render their office more eaſy, or their ſituation more ſafe.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the interference of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0270800301:36"/>
Roman government which was then eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Judea, I ſhould not expect, that, deſpiſing, as it did, the religion of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it would, if left to itſelf, animadvert, either with much vigilance, or much ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, upon the ſchiſms and controverſies which aroſe within it. Yet there was that in Chriſtianity which might eaſily afford a handle of accuſation with a jealous govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Chriſtians avowed an unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied obedience to a new maſter. They avowed alſo that he was the perſon who had been foretold to the Jews under the ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed title of King. The ſpiritual nature of this kingdom, the conſiſtency of this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with civil ſubjection, were diſtinctions too refined to be entertained by a Roman preſident, who viewed the buſineſs at a great diſtance, or through the medium of very hoſtile repreſentations. Our hiſtories ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly inform us, that this was the turn which the enemies of Jeſus gave to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and pretenſions in their remonſtrances with Pontius Pilate. And Juſtin Martyr, about a hundred years afterwards, complains
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0270800301:37"/>
that the ſame miſtake prevailed in his time; "ye having heard that we are waiting for a kingdom, ſuppoſe, without diſtinguiſhing, that we mean a human kingdom, when in truth we ſpeak of that which is with God <note n="*" place="bottom">Ap. 1<hi rend="sup">me</hi>. p. 16. ed. Thirl,</note>." And it was undoubtedly a natural ſource of calumny and miſconſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The preachers therefore of Chriſtianity had to contend with prejudice, backed by power. They had to come forward to a diſappointed people, to a prieſthood poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing a conſiderable ſhare of municipal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and actuated by ſtrong motives of oppoſition and reſentment; and they had to do this under a foreign government, to whoſe favour they made no pretenſions, and which was conſtantly ſurrounded by their enemics. The well known, becauſe the experienced, fate of reformers, whenever the reformation ſubverts ſome reigning opinion, and does not proceed upon a change already taken place in the ſentiments of a country, will
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0270800301:38"/>
not allow, much leſs lead us, to ſuppoſe, that the firſt propagators of Chriſtianity at Jeruſalem and in Judea, with the difficulties and the enemies which they had to contend with, and entirely deſtitute, as they were, of force, authority or protection, could exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their miſſion with perſonal eaſe and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>Let us next enquire what might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be expected by the preachers of Chriſtianity when they turned themſelves to the heathen public. Now the firſt thing that ſtrikes us is, that the religion they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with them was <hi>excluſive.</hi> It denied without reſerve the truth of every article of heathen mythology, the exiſtence of every object of their worſhip. It accepted no compromiſe: it admitted no comprehenſion. It muſt prevail, if it prevailed at all, by the overthrow of every ſtatue, altar and temple, in the world. It will not eaſily be credited that a deſign, ſo bold as this was, could in any age be attempted to be carried into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with impunity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0270800301:39"/>
For it ought to be conſidered, that this was not ſetting forth, or magnifying the character and worſhip of ſome new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor for a place in the Pantheon, whoſe pretenſions might be diſcuſſed or afferted without queſtioning the reality of any others. It was pronouncing all other gods to be falſe, and all other worſhip vain. From the facility with which the Polytheiſm of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient nations admitted new objects of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip into the number of their acknowledged divinities, or the patience with which they might entertain propoſals of this kind, we can argue nothing as to their toleration of a ſyſtem, or of the publiſhers and active propagators of a ſyſtem, which ſwept away the very foundation of the exiſting eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The one was nothing more than what it would be, in Popiſh countries, to add a ſaint to the calendar; the other was to aboliſh and tread under foot the calendar itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it ought alſo to be conſidered, that this was not the caſe of philoſophers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0270800301:40"/>
propounding in their books, or in their ſchools, doubts concerning the truth of the popular creed, or even avowing their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of it. Theſe philoſophers did not go about from place to place to collect proſelytes from amongſt the common-people; to form in the heart of the country ſocieties profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their tenets; to provide for the order, inſtruction and permanency of theſe ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; nor did they enjoin their followers to withdraw themſelves from the public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the temples, or refuſe a compliance with rites inſtituted by the laws <note n="*" place="bottom">The beſt of the ancient philoſophers, Plato, Cicero and Epictetus, allowed, or rather enjoined, men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the gods of the country, and in the eſtabliſhed form. See paſſages to this purpoſe, collected from their works by Dr. Clarke, Nat. and Rev. Rel. p. 180, ed. v. Except Socrates, they all thought it wiſer to comply with the laws, than to contend.</note>. Theſe things are what the Chriſtians did, and what the philoſophers did not: and in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the activity and danger of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it ought alſo to be conſidered,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0270800301:41"/>
that this danger proceeded not merely from ſolemn acts and public reſolutions of the ſtate, but from ſudden burſts of violence at particular places, from the licence of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, the raſhneſs of ſome magiſtrates and the negligence of others, from the influence and inſtigation of intereſted adverſaries, and, in general, from the variety and warmth of opinion which an errand ſo novel and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary could not fail of exciting. I can conceive that the teachers of Chriſtianity might both fear and ſuſſer much from theſe cauſes, without any general perſecution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denouncedag a inſt them by imperial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Some length of time, I ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, might paſs, before the vaſt machine of the Roman empire would be put in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or its attention be obtained to religious controverſy; but, during that time, a great deal of ill uſage might be endured, by a ſet of friendleſs, unprotected travellers, telling men, wherever they came, that the religion of their anceſtors, the religion in which they had been brought up, the religion of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0270800301:42"/>
the ſtate and of the magiſtrate, the rites which they frequented, the pomp which they admired, was throughout a ſyſtem of folly and deluſion.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I think that the teachers of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity would ſind protection in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſbelief of the popular theology, which is ſuppoſed to have prevailed amongſt the intelligent part of the heathen public. It is by no means true that unbelievers are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tolerant. They are not diſpoſed (and why ſhould they?) to endanger the preſent ſtate of things, by ſuffering a religion of which they believe nothing, to be diſturbed by another of which they believe as little. They are ready themſelves to conform to any thing; and are, oftentimes, amongſt the foremoſt to procure conformity from others, by any method which they think likely to be eſſicacious. When was ever a change of religion patronized by inſidels? How little, notwithſtanding the reigning ſcepticiſm, and the magnified liberality, of that age, the true
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0270800301:43"/>
principles of toleration were underſtood by the wiſeſt men amongſt them, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from two eminent and unconteſted examples. The younger Pliny, poliſhed, as he was, by all the literature of that ſoft and elegant period, could gravely pronounce this monſtroiis judgment: "Thoſe, who perſiſted in declaring themſelves Chriſtians, I ordered to be led away to puniſhment (<hi>i. e.</hi> to execution), for I DID NOT DOUBT, <hi>whatever it was that they confeſſed, that contumacy and inflexible obſtinacy ought to be puniſhed."</hi> His maſter, Trajan, a mild and accompliſhed prince, went, nevertheleſs, no farther in his ſentiments of moderation and equity, than what appears in the following reſcript: "The Chriſtians are not to be ſought for; but if any are brought before you, and convicted, they are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed." And this direction he gives, after it had been reported to him by his own preſident, that, by the moſt ſtrict examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing could be diſcovered in the principles of theſe perſons, but "a bad and exceſſive ſuperſtition," accompanied, it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0270800301:44"/>
ſeems, with an oath or mutual federation, "to allow themſelves in no crime or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral conduct whatever." The truth is, the ancient heathens conſidered religion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely as an affair of ſtate, as much under the tuition of the magiſtrate as any other part of the police. The religion of that age was not merely allied to the ſtate: it was incorporated into it. Many of its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were adminiſtered by the magiſtrate. Its titles of pontiffs, augurs, and flamens, were borne by ſenators, conſuls and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Without diſcuſſing therefore the truth of the theology, they reſented every affront put upon the eſtabliſhed worſhip, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to the authority of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Add to which, that the religious ſyſtems of thoſe times, however ill ſupported by evidence, had been long eſtabliſhed. The <hi>ancient</hi> religion of a country has always many votaries, and ſometimes not the fewer becauſe its origin is hidden in remoteneſs and obſcurity. Men have a natural veneration
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0270800301:45"/>
for antiquity, eſpecially in matters of religion. What Tacitus ſays of the Jewiſh, was more applicable to the heathen eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, "hi ritus, quoquo modo inducti, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitate defenduntur." It was alſo a ſplendid and ſumptuous worſhip. It had its prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, its endowments, its temples. Statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, painting, architecture, and muſic, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed their effect to its ornament and magnificence. It abounded in feſtival ſhows and ſolemnities, to which the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are greatly addicted; and which were of a nature to engage them much more than any thing of that ſort among us. Theſe things would retain great numbers on its ſide by the faſcination of ſpectacle and pomp, as well as intereſt many in its preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the advantage which they drew from it. "It was moreover interwoven," as Mr. Gibbons rightly repreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0270800301:46"/>
proſperity of their country in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure depended.</p>
                  <p>I am willing to accept the account of the matter which is given by Mr. Gibbon: "The various modes of worſhip which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the Roman world, were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by the people as equally true, by the philoſophers as equally falſe, and by the magiſtrate as equally uſeful:" and I would aſk, from which of theſe three claſſes of men were the Chriſtian miſſionaries to look for protection or impunity? Could they expect it from the people, "whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged conſidence in the public reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion" they ſubverted from its foundation? from the philoſopher, who, "conſidering all religions as equally falſe," would of courſe rank theirs amongſt the number, with the addition of regarding them as buſy and troubleſome zealots? or from the magiſtrate, who, ſatisfied with the "utility" of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting religion, would not be likely to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance a ſpirit of proſelytiſm and innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a ſyſtem, which declared war againſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0270800301:47"/>
every other, and which, if it prevailed, muſt end in a total rupture of public opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; an upſtart religion, in a word, which was not content with its own authority, but muſt diſgrace all the ſettled religions of the world? It was not to be imagined that he would endure with patience, that the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the emperor and of the ſtate ſhould be calumniated and borne down, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſuperſtitious and deſpicable Jews.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly; the <hi>nature of the caſe</hi> affords a ſtrong proof, that the original teachers of Chriſtianity, in conſequence of their new profeſſion, entered upon a new and ſingular courſe of life. We may be allowed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that the inſtitution which they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to others, they conformed to in their own perſons; becauſe this is no more than what every teacher of a new religion both does, and muſt do, in order to obtain either proſelytes or hearers. The change which this would produce was very conſiderable. It is a change which we do not eaſily eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, becauſe, ourſelves and all about us
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0270800301:48"/>
being habituated to the inſtitution from our infancy, it is what we neither experience nor obſerve. After men became Chriſtians, much of their time was ſpent in prayer and devotion, in religious meetings, in celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the euchariſt, in conferences, in exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in preaching, in an affectionate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with one another, and correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with other ſocieties. Perhaps their mode of life in its form and habit was not very unlike the Unitas Fratrum, or of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Methodiſts. Think then what it was to become <hi>ſuch</hi> at Corinth, at Epheſus, at Antioch, or even at Jeruſalem. How new! How aliene from all their former habits and ideas, and from thoſe of every body about them! What a revolution there muſt have been of opinions and prejudices to bring the matter to this!</p>
                  <p>We know what the precepts of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are; how pure, how benevolent, how diſintereſted a conduct they enjoin; and that this purity and benevolence is extended to the very thoughts and affections. We
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0270800301:49"/>
are not perhaps at liberty to take for granted, that the lives of the preachers of Chriſtianity were as perfect as their leſſons: but we are entitled to contend, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable part of their behaviour muſt have agreed in a great meaſure with the duties which they taught. There was therefore, which is all that we aſſert, a courſe of life purſued by them, different from that which they before led. And this is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Men are brought to any thing almoſt ſooner than to change their habit of life, eſpecially, when the change is either inconvenient, or made againſt the force of natural inclination, or with the loſs of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed indulgences. "It is the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult of all things to convert men from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious habits to virtuous ones, as every one may judge from what he ſeels in himſelf, as well as from what he ſees in others <note n="*" place="bottom">Hartley's Eſſ. on Man, p. 190.</note>." It is almoſt like making men over again.</p>
                  <p>Left then to myſelf, and without any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0270800301:50"/>
more information than a knowledge of the exiſtence of the religion, of the general ſtory upon which it is founded, and that no act of power, force, or authority, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in its firſt ſucceſs, I ſhould conclude, from the very nature and exigency of the caſe, that the author of the religion during his life, and his immediate diſciples after his death, <hi>exerled</hi> themſelves in ſpreading and publiſhing the inſtitution throughout the country in which it began, and into which it was firſt carried; that, in the proſecution of this purpoſe, they underwent the labours and troubles, which we obſerve the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators of new ſects to undergo: that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt muſt neceſſarily have alſo been in a high degree dangerous; that from the ſubject of the miſſion, compared with the fixed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and prejudices of thoſe to whom the miſſionaries were to addreſs themſelves, they could hardly fail of encountering ſtrong and ſrequent oppoſition; that, by the hand of government, as well as from the ſudden ſury and unbridled licence of the people, they would oftentimes experience injurious
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0270800301:51"/>
and cruel treatment; that, at any rate, they muſt have always had ſo much to fear for their perſonal ſafety, as to have paſſed their lives in a ſtate of conſtant peril and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and laſtly, that their mode of life and conduct, viſibly at leaſt, correſponded with the inſtitution which they delivered, and ſo far, was both new, and required continual ſelf-denial.</p>

                  <p>AFTER thus conſidering what was <hi>likely</hi> to happen, we are next to enquire how the tranſaction is repreſented in the ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that have come down to us. And this enquiry is properly preceded by the other, foraſmuch as the reception of theſe accounts may depend in part upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility of what they contain.</p>
                  <p>The obſcure and diſtant view of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0270800301:53"/>
which ſome of the heathen writers of that age had gained, and which a few paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in their remaining works incidentally diſcover to us, offers itſelf to our notice in the firſt place: becauſe, ſo far as this evidence goes, it is the conceſſion of adverſaries; the ſource from which it is drawn is unſuſpected. Under this head a quotation from Tacitus, well known to every ſcholar, muſt be inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as deſerving of particular attention. The Reader will bear in mind that this paſſage was written about ſeventy years after Chriſt's death, and that it relates to tranſactions which took place about thirty years after that event. Speaking of the fire which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at Rome in the time of Nero, and of the ſuſpicions which were entertained that the emperor himſelf was concerned in cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the hiſtorian proceeds in his narrative and obſervations thus:</p>
                  <q>"But neither theſe exertions, nor his lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes to the people, nor his offerings to the gods, did away the infamous imputation
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0270800301:54"/>
under which Nero lay, of having ordered the city to be ſet on fire. To put an end therefore to this report, he laid the guilt, and inflicted the moſt cruel puniſhments upon a ſet of people, who were held in abhorrence for their crimes, and called by the vulgar <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The founder of that name was Chriſt, who ſuffered death in the reign of Tiberius, under his procurator Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate.—This pernicious ſuperſtition, thus checked for a while, broke out again; and ſpread not only over Judea, where the evil originated, but through Rome alſo, whither every thing bad upon earth finds its way, and is practiſed. Some who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their ſect were firſt ſeized, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by their information a vaſt multitude were apprehended, who were convicted, not ſo much of the crime of burning Rome, as of hatred to mankind. Their ſufferings at their execution were aggravated by inſult and mockery, for ſome were diſguiſed in the ſkins of wild beaſts, and worried to death by dogs—ſome were crucified—and others
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0270800301:55"/>
were wrapt in pitched ſhirts <note n="*" place="bottom">This is rather a paraphraſe, but is juſtified by what the Scholiaſt upon Juvenal ſays—"Nero maleſicos ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines tedâ et papyro et cerâ ſuperveſtiebat, et ſic ad ignem admoveri jubebat." Lard. Jewiſh and Heath. Teſt. vol. i. p. 359.</note>, and ſet on fire when the day cloſed, that they might ſerve as lights to illuminate the night. Nero lent his own gardens for theſe executions; and exhibited at the ſame time a mock Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſian entertainment, being a ſpectator of the whole in the dreſs of a charioteer, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mingling with the crowd on foot, and ſometimes viewing the ſpectacles from his car. This conduct made the ſuſſerers pitied; and though they were criminals, and deſerving the ſevereſt puniſhment, yet they were conſidered as ſacriſiced, not ſo much out of a regard to the public good, as to gratify the cruelty of one man."</q>
                  <p>Our concern with this paſſage at preſent is only ſo far, as it affords a preſumption in ſupport of the propoſition which we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, concerning the activity and ſufferings
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0270800301:56"/>
of the firſt teachers of Chriſtianity. Now, conſidered in this view, it proves three things: 1ſt, that the founder of the inſtitution was put to death; 2dly, that, in the ſame country in which he was put to death, the religion, after a ſhort check, broke out again and ſpread; 3dly, that it ſo ſpread, as that, within thirty-four years from the author's death, a very great number of Chriſtians (ingens eorum multitudo) were found at Rome. From which fact, the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inferences may be fairly drawn: firſt, that, if, in the ſpace of thirty-four years from its commencement, the religion had ſpread throughout Judea, had extended it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Rome, and there had numbered a great multitude of converts, the original teachers and miſſionaries of the inſtitution could not have been <hi>idle;</hi> ſecondly, that when the author of the undertaking was put to death as a malefactor for his attempt, the endeavours of his followers to eſtabliſh his religion, in the ſame country, amongſt the ſame people, and in the ſame age, could not but be attended with danger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0270800301:57"/>
Suetonius, a writer contemporary with Tacitus, deſcribing the tranſactions of the ſame reign, uſes theſe words, "Affecti ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis Chriſtiani, genus hominum ſuperſtitionis novae et maleſicae <note n="*" place="bottom">Suet. Nero. cap. 16.</note>." "The Chriſtians, a ſet of men, of a new and miſchievous (or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal) ſuperſtition, were puniſhed."</p>
                  <p>Since it is not mentioned <hi>here</hi> that the burning of the city was the pretence of the puniſhment of the Chriſtians, or that they were the Chriſtians of Rome who alone ſuffered, it is probable that Suetonius refers to ſome more general perſecution than the ſhort and occaſional one which Tacitus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes.</p>
                  <p>Juvenal, a writer of the ſame age with the two former, and intending, as it ſhould ſeem, to commemorate the cruelties exerciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Nero's government, has the following lines <note n="†" place="bottom">Sat. 1, ver. 155.</note>:</p>

                  <p>If this paſſage were conſidered by itſelf, the ſubject of the alluſion might be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but when connected with the teſtimony of Suetonius, as to the actual puniſhment of the Chriſtians by Nero; and with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given by Tacitus of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of puniſhment which they were made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo; I think it ſufficiently probable, that theſe were the executions to which the poet refers.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, as hath already been obſerved,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0270800301:59"/>
took place within thirty-one years after Chriſt's death, that is, according to the courſe of nature, in the life-time, probably, of ſome of the apoſtles, and certainly in the life-time of thoſe who were converted by the apoſtles, or who were converted in their time. If then the founder of the religion was put to death in the execution of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; if the firſt race of converts to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, many of them ſuffered the greateſt extremities for their profeſſion; it is hardly credible, that thoſe who came <hi>between</hi> the two, who were companions of the author of the inſtitution during his life, and the teachers and propagators of the inſtitution after his death, could go about their undertaking with eaſe and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>The teſtimony of the younger Pliny be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a later period; for although he was contemporary with Tacitus and Suetonius, yet his account does not, like theirs, go back to the tranſactions of Nero's reign, but is confined to the affairs of his own time. His celebrated letter to Trajan was written
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0270800301:60"/>
about ſeventy years after Chriſt's death; and the information to be drawn from it; ſo far as it is connected with our argument, relates principally to two points: firſt, to the <hi>number</hi> of Chriſtians in Bithynia and Pontus, which was ſo conſiderable as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the governor of theſe provinces to ſpeak of them in the following terms, "Multi, omnis aetatis, utriuſque ſexûs etiam—neque enim civitates tantum, ſed vicos etiam et agros, ſuperſtitionis iſtius contagio pervagata eſt." "There are many of every age and of both ſexes—nor has the contagion of this ſuperſtition ſeized cities only, but ſmaller towns alſo, and the open country." Great exertions muſt have been uſed by the preachers of Chriſtianity to produce this ſtate of things within this time. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to a point which hath been already noticed, and which I think of importance to be obſerved, namely, the ſufferings to which Chriſtians were expoſed, <hi>without</hi> any public perſecution being denounced againſt them by ſovereign authority. For, from Pliny's doubt how he was to act, his ſilence

concerning any ſubſiſting law upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, his requeſting the emperor's reſcript, and the emperor, agreeably to his requeſt, propounding a rule for his direction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reference to any prior rule, it may be inferred, that there was, at that time, no public edict againſt the Chriſtians in force. Yet from this ſame epiſtle of Pliny it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears "that accuſations, trials and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were, and had been, going on againſt them, in the provinces over which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided; that ſchedules were delivered by anonymous informers, containing the names of perſons who were ſuſpected of holding or of favouring the religion; that, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe informations, many had been apprehended, of whom ſome boldly avowed their profeſſion, and died in the cauſe; others denied that they were Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; others, acknowledging that they had once been Chriſtians, declared that they had long ceaſed to be ſuch." All which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that the profeſſion of Chriſtianity was at that time (in that country at leaſt) attended with fear and danger: and yet this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0270800301:62"/>
took place without any edict from the Roman ſovereign, commanding or authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſecution of Chriſtians. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is farther conſirmed by a reſcript of Adrian to Minucius Fundanus, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul of Aſia <note n="*" place="bottom">Lard. Heath. Teſt. v. ii. p. 110.</note>: from which reſcript it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the cuſtom of the people of Aſia was to proceed againſt the Chriſtians with tumult and uproar. This diſorderly practice, I ſay, is recognized in the edict, becauſe the emperor enjoins, that, for the future, if the Chriſtians were guilty they ſhould be legally brought to trial, and not be purſued by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and clamour.</p>
                  <p>Martial wrote a few years before the younger Pliny; and, as his manner was, made the ſufferings of the Chriſtians the ſubject of his ridicule <note n="†" place="bottom">In matutinâ nuper ſpectatus arenâ Mucius, impoſuit qui ſua membra focis, Si patiens fortiſque tibi duruſque videtur, Abderitanae pectora plebis habes; Nam cum dicatur tunicâ praeſente moleſtâ, Ure <note n="*" place="bottom">Forſan "thure manum."</note> manum, plus eſt dicere, non facio.</note>. Nothing however
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0270800301:63"/>
could ſhew the notoriety of the fact with more certainty than this does. Martial's teſtimony, as well indeed as Pliny's, goes alſo to another point, viz. that the deaths of theſe men were martyrdoms in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, that is to ſay, were ſo voluntary, that it was in their power, at the time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the ſentence, to have averted the execution, by conſenting to join in heathen ſacriſices.</p>
                  <p>The conſtancy, and by conſequence the ſufferings, of the Chriſtians of this period, is alſo referred to by Epictetus, who imputes their intrepidity to madneſs, or to a kind of faſhion or habit; and about fifty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, by Marcus Aurelius, who aſcribes it to obſtinacy.

                  <head type="sub">There is ſatisfactory evidence, that many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to be original witneſſes of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian miracles, paſſed their lives in labours, dangers, and ſufferings, voluntarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in atteſtation of the accounts which they delivered, and ſolely in conſequence of their belief of thoſe accounts; and that they alſo ſubmitted from the ſame motive to new rules of conduct.</head>
                  <p>OF the primitive condition of Chriſtianity, a diſtant only and general view can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from heathen writers. It is in our own books that the detail and interior of the tranſaction muſt be ſought for. And this is nothing different from what might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Who would write a hiſtory of Chriſtianity but a Chriſtian? Who was likely to record the travels, ſufferings, labours, or ſucceſſes of the apoſtles, but one of their own number, or of their followers? Now
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0270800301:66"/>
theſe books come up in their accounts to the full extent of the propoſition which we maintain. We have four hiſtories of Jeſus Chriſt. We have a hiſtory taking up the narrative from his death, and carrying on an account of the propagation of the religion, and of ſome of the moſt eminent perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, for a ſpace of nearly thirty years. We have, what ſome may think ſtill more original, a collection of letters, written by certain principal agents in the buſineſs, upon the buſineſs, and in the midſt of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and connection with it. And we have theſe writings ſeverally atteſting the point which we contend for, viz. the ſufferings of the witneſſes of the hiſtory, and atteſting it in every variety of form in which it can be conceived to appear; directly and indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, expreſsly and incidentally, by aſſertion, recital, and alluſion, by narratives of facts, and by arguments and diſcourſes built upon theſe facts, either referring to them, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily preſuppoſing them.</p>
                  <p>I remark this variety, becauſe in examining
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0270800301:67"/>
ancient records, or indeed any ſpecies of teſtimony, it is, in my opinion, of the greateſt importance to attend to the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or grounds of argument which are <hi>caſually</hi> and <hi>undeſignedly</hi> diſcloſed; foraſmuch as this ſpecies of proof is, of all others, the leaſt liable to be corrupted by fraud or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation.</p>
                  <p>I may be allowed therefore, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry which is now before us, to ſuggeſt ſome concluſions of this ſort, as preparatory to more direct teſtimony.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our books relate, that Jeſus Chriſt, the founder of the religion, was, in conſequence of his undertaking, put to death, as a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, at Jeruſalem. This point at leaſt will be granted, becauſe it is no more than what Tacitus has recorded. They then proceed to tell us, that the religion was, <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,</hi> ſet forth at this ſame city of Jeruſalem, propagated from thence through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Judea, and afterwards preached in other parts of the Roman cmpire. Theſe points alſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0270800301:68"/>
are fully confirmed by Tacitus, who informs us that the religion, after a ſhort check, broke out again in the country where it took its riſe; that it not only ſpread throughout Judea, but had reached Rome; and that it had there great multitudes of converts: and all this within thirty years after its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement. Now theſe facts afford a ſtrong inference in behalf of the propoſition which we maintain. What could the diſciples of Chriſt expect for themſelves, when they ſaw their maſter put to death? Could they hope to eſcape the dangers, in which he had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed? If they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you, was the warning of common ſenſe. With this example before their eyes, they could not be without a full ſenſe of the peril of their future enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, all the hiſtories agree in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting Chriſt as ſoretelling the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his followers.</p>
                  <q>"Then ſhall they dellver you up to be afflicted, and ſhall kill you, and ye ſhall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0270800301:69"/>
be hated of all nations for my name's ſake <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxiv. 9.</note>."</q>
                  <q>"When affliction or perſecution ariſeth for the word's ſake, immediately they are offended <note n="†" place="bottom">Mark iv. 17, See alſo x. 30.</note>,"</q>
                  <q>"They ſhall lay hands on you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you, delivering you up to the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and into priſons, being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kings and rulers for my name's ſake—and ye ſhall be betrayed both by parents and brethren, and kinsfolks and friends, and ſome of you ſhall they cauſe to be put to death <note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xxi. 12—16. See alſo xi. 49.</note>."</q>
                  <q>"The time cometh, that he that killeth you will think that he doeth God ſervice. And theſe things will they do unto you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not known the father nor me. But theſe things have I told you, that when the time ſhall come ye may remember that I told you of them <note n="§" place="bottom">John xvi. 4. See alſo xv, 20, and xvi. 33.</note>."</q>

                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0270800301:70"/>
I am not entitled to argue from theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that Chriſt actually did foretell theſe events, and that they did accordingly come to paſs, becauſe that would be at once to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the truth of the religion: but I am entitled to contend, that one ſide or other of the following disjunction is true; either that the evangeliſts have delivered what Chriſt really ſpoke, and that the event cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with the prediction; or that they put the prediction into Chriſt's mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, at the time of writing the hiſtory, the event had turned out ſo to be: for the only two remaining ſuppoſitions appear in the higheſt degree incredible, which are, either that Chriſt ſilled the minds of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers with fears and apprehenſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſon or authority for what he ſaid, and contrary to the truth of the caſe; or that, although Chriſt had never foretold any ſuch thing, and the event would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted him if he had, yet hiſtorians who lived in the age when the event was known, falſely as well as oſſiciouſly, aſcribed theſe words to him.</p>

                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0270800301:71"/>
3. Thirdly, theſe books abound with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to patience, and with topics of comfort under diſtreſs.</p>
                  <q>"Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 35. 37.</note>."</q>
                  <q>"We are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; we are perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jeſus, that the life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our body—knowing that he which raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe us up alſo by Jeſus, and ſhall preſent us with you—for which cauſe we faint not, but, though our outward man periſh, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is renewed day by day; for our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0270800301:72"/>
light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. iv. 8, 9, 10. 14. 16, 17.</note>."</q>
                  <q>"Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have ſpoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of ſuffering affliction, and of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Behold we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have ſeen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy <note n="†" place="bottom">James v. 10, 11.</note>."</q>
                  <q>"Call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured a great fight of afflictions, partly whilſt ye were made a gazing-ſtock both by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and afflictions, and partly whilſt ye became companions of them that were ſo uſed; for ye had compaſſion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in yourſelves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0270800301:73"/>
Caſt not away therefore your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, which hath great recompenſe of reward; for ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. x. 32—36.</note>."</q>
                  <q>"So that we ourſelves glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your perſecutions and tribulations that ye endure. Which is a manifeſt token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be accounted worthy of the kingdom for which ye alſo ſuffer <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. i. 1—5.</note>."</q>
                  <q>"We rejoice in hope of the glory of God; and not only ſo, but we glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations alſo; knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. v. 3, 4.</note>."</q>
                  <q>"Beloved, think it not ſtrange concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fiery trial which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you, but rejoice, inaſmuch as ye are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0270800301:74"/>
partakers of Chriſt's ſufferings. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their ſouls to him in well doing as unto a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pct. iv. 12, 13. 19.</note>."</q>
                  <p>What could all theſe texts mean, if there was nothing in the circumſtances of the times which required patience, which called for the exerciſe of conſtancy and reſolution? or will it be pretended that theſe exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (which, let it be obſerved, come not from one author, but from many) were put in, merely to induce a belief in after-ages, that the ſirſt Chriſtians were expoſed to dangers which they were not expoſed to, or underwent ſufferings which they did not undergo? If theſe books belong to the age to which they lay claim, and in which age, whether genuine or ſpurious, they certainly did appear, this ſuppoſition cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for a moment; becauſe I think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to believe, that paſſages, which muſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0270800301:75"/>
be deemed not only unintelligible but falſe, by the perſons into whoſe hands the books upon their publication were to come, ſhould nevertheleſs be inſerted, for the purpoſe of producing an effect upon remote genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In forgeries which do not appear till many ages after that to which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to belong, it is poſſible that ſome contrivance of that ſort may take place; but in no others can it be attempted.</p>

                  <p>THE account of the treatment of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and of the exertions of its firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as ſtated in our ſcriptures (not in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed hiſtory of perſecutions, or in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected manner in which I am about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite it, but diſperſedly and occaſionally, in the courſe of a mixed, general, hiſtory, which circumſtance alone negatives the ſuppoſition of any fraudulent deſign), is the following: "That the ſounder of Chriſtianity, ſrom the commencement of his miniſtry to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0270800301:77"/>
time of his violent death, employed himſelf wholly in publiſhing the inſtitution in Judea and Galilee; that, in order to aſſiſt him in this purpoſe, he made choice, out of the number of his followers, of twelve perſons, who might accompany him as he travelled from place to place; that, except a ſhort ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence upon a journey, in which he ſent them, two by two, to announce his miſſion, and one, of a few days, when they went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to Jeruſalem, theſe perſons were ſtatedly and conſtantly attending upon him; that they were with him at Jeruſalem when he was apprehended and put to death; and that they were commiſſioned by him, when his own miniſtry was concluded, to publiſh his goſpel, and collect diſciples to it from all countries of the world." The account then proceeds to ſtate, "That, a few days after his departure, theſe perſons, with ſome of his relations, and ſome who had regularly frequented their ſociety, aſſembled at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; that, conſidering the oſſice of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the religion as now devolved upon them, and one of their number having deſerted the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0270800301:78"/>
cauſe, and, repenting of his perfidy, having deſtroyed himſelf, they proceeded to elect another into his place; and that they were careful to make their election out of the number of thoſe who had accompanied their maſter from the firſt to the laſt, in order, as they alledged, that he might be a witneſs, together with themſelves, of the principal facts which they were about to produce and relate concerning him <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts i. 21, 22.</note>; that they began their work at Jeruſalem, by publicly aſſerting that this Jeſus, whom the rulers and inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of that place had ſo lately crucified, was, in truth, the perſon, in whom all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and long expectations terminated; that he had been ſent amongſt them by God; and that he was appointed by God the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture judge of the human ſpecies; that all, who were ſolicitous to ſecure to themſelves happineſs after death, ought to receive him as ſuch, and to make profeſſion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, by being baptized in his name <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xi.</note>." The hiſtory goes on to relate, "that conſiderable
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0270800301:79"/>
numbers accepted this propoſal, and that they who did ſo, formed amongſt themſelves a ſtrict union and ſociety <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts v. 41.</note>; that, the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jewiſh government being ſoon drawn upon them, two of the principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the twelve, and who alſo had lived moſt intimately and conſtantly with the founder of the religion, were ſeized as they were diſcourſing to the people in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that, after being kept all night in priſon, they were brought the next day before an aſſembly, compoſed of the chief perſons of the Jewiſh magiſtracy and prieſthood; that this aſſembly, after ſome conſultation, found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, at that time, better to be done towards ſuppreſſing the growth of the ſect, than to threaten their priſoners with puniſhment, if they perſiſted; that theſe men, after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, in decent but firm language, the obligation under which they conſidered themſelves to be, to declare what they knew, "to ſpeak the things which they had ſeen and heard," returned from the council, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0270800301:80"/>
reported what had paſſed to their companions; that this report, whilſt it apprized them of the danger of their ſituation and undertaking, had no other effect upon their conduct, than to produce in them a general reſolution to perſevere, and an earneſt prayer to God to furniſh them with aſſiſtance, and to inſpire them with fortitude, proportioned to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing exigency of the ſervice <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts iv.</note>." A very ſhort time after this, we read "that all the twelve apoſtles were ſeized and caſt into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts v. 18.</note>; that being brought a ſecond time before the Jewiſh Sanhedrim, they were upbraided with their diſobedience to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction which had been laid upon them, and beaten for their contumacy; that being charged once more to deſiſt, they were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to depart; that however they neither quitted Jeruſalem, nor ceaſed from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both daily in the temple, and from houſe to houſe <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts v.</note>; and that the twelve conſidered themſelves as ſo entirely and excluſively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to this office, that they now transferred,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0270800301:81"/>
what may be called the temporal affairs of the ſociety, to other hands <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>I do not know that it has ever been inſinuated, that the Chriſtian miſſion, in the hands of the apoſtles, was a ſcheme for making a fortune, or for getting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. But it may nevertheleſs be fit to remark upon this paſſage of their hiſtory, how perfectly free they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been from any pecuniary or intereſted views whatever. The moſt tempting opportunity, which occurred, of making a gain of their converts, was by the cuſtody and management of the public funds, when ſome of the richer members, intending to contribute their fortunes to the common ſupport of the ſociety, ſold their poſſeſſions, and laid down the prices at the apoſtles' feet. Yet ſo inſenſible, or undeſirous, were they of the advantage which that confidence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, that, we find, they very ſoon diſpoſed of the truſt, by putting it into the hands, not of nominees of their own, but of ſtewards formally elected for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by the ſociety at large.</p>
                        <p>We may add alſo, that this exceſs of generoſity, which caſt private property into the public ſtock, was ſo far from being required by the apoſtles, or impoſed as a law of Chriſtianity, that Peter reminds Ananias that he had been guilty, in his behaviour, of an officious and voluntary prevarication; for whilſt, ſays he, thy eſtate remained unſold, "was it not thine own? and, after it was fold, was it not in thine own power?"</p>

Hitherto the preachers of the new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſeem to have had the common people on their ſide; which is aſſigned as the reaſon, why the Jewiſh rulers did not, at this time, think it prudent to proceed to greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. It was not long, however, before the enemies of the inſtitution found means to repreſent it to the people as tending to ſubvert their law, degrade their law-giver, and diſhonour their temple <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts vi. 12.</note>. And theſe inſinuations were diſperſed with ſo much ſucceſs, as to induce the people to join with their ſuperiors in the ſtoning of a very active member of the new community.</p>
                  <p>The death of this man was the ſignal of a general perſecution, the activity of which may be judged of from one anecdote of the time: "As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every houſe, and haling men and women, committed them to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon." This perſecution <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts viii. 3.</note> raged at Jeruſalem
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0270800301:83"/>
with ſo much fury, as to drive moſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts viii. 1. "And they were <hi>all</hi> ſcattered abroad;" but the term "all" is not, I think, to be taken ſtrictly, or as denoting more than the <hi>generality;</hi> in like manner as in Acts ix. 35. "And <hi>all</hi> that dwelt at Lydda and Saron ſaw him, and turned to the Lord."</note> of the new converts out of the place, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the twelve apoſtles. The converts, thus "ſcattered abroad," preached the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion wherever they came: and their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, in effect, the preaching of the <hi>twelve;</hi> for it was ſo far carried on in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert and correſpondence with <hi>them,</hi> that, when they heard of the ſucceſs of their emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries in a particular country, they ſent two of their number to the place to complete and confirm the miſſion.</p>
                  <p>An event now took place of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the future hiſtory of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts ix.</note> perſecution which had begun at Jeruſalem, followed the Chriſtians to other cities, in which the authority of the Jewiſh
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0270800301:84"/>
Sanhedrim over thoſe of their own nation was allowed to be exerciſed. A young man, who had ſignalized himſelf by his hoſtility to the profeſſion, and had procured a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the council at Jeruſalem to ſeize any converted Jews whom he might ſind at Damaſcus, ſuddenly became a proſelyte to the religion which he was going about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate. The new convert not only ſhared, upon this extraordinary change, the ſate of his companions, but brought upon himſelf a double meaſure of enmity from the party which he had left. The Jews at Damaſcus, upon his return to that city, watched the gates night and day with ſo much diligence, that he eſcaped from their hands only by being let down in a baſket by the wall. Nor did he ſind himſelf in greater ſafety at Jeruſalem, whither he immediately repaired. Attempts were there alſo ſoon ſet on foot to deſtroy him, ſrom the danger of which he was preſerved by being ſent away to Cilicia, his native country.</p>
                  <p>For ſome reaſon, not mentioned, perhaps
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0270800301:85"/>
not known, but probably connected with the civil hiſtory of the Jews, or with ſome danger <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Lardner (in which he is followed alſo by Dr. Benſon) aſcribes this ceſſation of the perſecution of the Chriſtians to the attempt of Caligula to ſet up his own ſtatue in the Temple of Jeruſalem, and to the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby excited in the minds of the Jewiſh people; which conſternation for a ſeaſon ſuſpended every other conteſt.</note> which engroſſed the public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an intermiſſion about this time took place in the ſufferings of the Chriſtians. This happened, at the moſt only ſeven or eight, perhaps only three or four, years after Chriſt's death. Within which period, and notwithſtanding that the late perſecution oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied part of it, churches, or ſocieties of believers, had been formed in all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria; for we read that the churches in theſe countries "had <hi>now reſt,</hi> and were ediſied, and, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt, were multiplied <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts ix. 31.</note>." The original preachers of the religion did not remit their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0270800301:86"/>
labours or activity during this ſeaſon of quietneſs; for we find one, and he a very principal perſon amongſt them, paſſing throughout all quarters. We find alſo thoſe, who had been before cxpelled from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem by the perſecution which raged there, travelling as far as Phoenice, Cyprus, and Antioch <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts. xi. 19.</note>; and laſtly, we find Jeruſalem again the centre of the miſſion, the place whither the preachers returned from their ſeveral excurſions, where they reported the conduct and effects of their miniſtry, where queſtions of public concern were canvaſſed and ſettled, from whence directions were ſought, and teachers ſent forth.</p>
                  <p>The time of this tranquillity did not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, continue long. Herod Agrippa, who had lately acceded to the government of Judea, "ſtretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xii. 1.</note>." He began his cruelty by beheading one of the twelve ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal apoſtles, a kinſman and conſtant companion
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0270800301:87"/>
of the founder of the religion. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that this execution gratified the Jews, he proceeded to ſeize, in order to put to death, another of the number; and him, like the former, aſſociated with Chriſt' during his life, and eminently active in the ſervice ſince his death. This man was, however, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from priſon, as the account ſtates <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xii. 3—17.</note>, miraculouſly, and made his eſcape from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things are related, not in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms under which, in giving the outlines of the hiſtory, we have here mentioned them, but with the utmoſt particularity of names, perſons, places, and circumſtances; and, what is deſerving of notice, without the ſmalleſt diſcoverable propenſity in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian to magnify the fortitude, or exaggerate the ſufferings, of his party. When they fled for their lives, he tells us. When the churches had reſt, he remarks it. When the people took their part, he does not leave
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0270800301:88"/>
it without notice. When the apoſtles were carried a ſecond time before the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nhedrim, he is careful to obſerve that they were brought without violence. When milder councils were ſuggeſted, he gives us the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the advice, and the ſpeech which contained it. When, in conſequence of this advice, the rulers contented themſelves with threatening the apoſtles, and commanding them to be beaten with ſtripes, without urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time the perſecution farther, the hiſtorian candidly and diſtinctly records their forbearance. When, therefore, in other inſtances, he ſtates heavier perſecutions, or actual martyrdoms, it is reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he ſtates them becauſe they were true; and not from any wiſh to aggravate, in his account, the ſufferings which Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſuſtained, or to extol, more than it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, their patience under them.</p>
                  <p>Our hiſtory now purſues a narrower path. Leaving the reſt of the apoſtles, and the original aſſociates of Chriſt, engaged in the propagation of the new faith (and who, there is not the leaſt reaſon to believe, abated in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0270800301:89"/>
their diligence or courage), the narrative proceeds with the ſeparate memoirs of that eminent teacher, whoſe extraordinary and ſudden converſion to the religion, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding change of conduct, had before been circumſtantially deſcribed. This perſon, in conjunction with another, who appeared amongſt the earlieſt members of the ſociety at Jeruſalem, and amongſt the immediate adherents <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts iv. 36.</note> of the twelve apoſtles, ſet out from Antioch upon the expreſs buſineſs of carrying the new religion through the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous provinces of the Leſſer Aſia <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xiii. 2.</note>. During this expedition we find, that, in almoſt every place to which they came, their perſons were inſulted, and their lives endangered. After being expelled from Antioch in Piſidia, they repaired to leonium <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xiii. 50.</note>. At Iconium an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was made to ſtone them. At Lyſtra, whither they fled from Iconium, one of them actually was ſtoned, and drawn out of the city for dead <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts xiv. 5.</note>. Theſe two men, though not themſelves original apoſtles, were acting
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0270800301:90"/>
in connection and conjunction with the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal apoſtles; for, after the completion of their journey, being ſent upon a particular commiſſion to Jeruſalem, they there related to the apoſtles <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xv. 12—26.</note> and elders the events and ſucceſs of their miniſtry, and were, in return, recommended by them to the churches, "as men who had hazarded their lives in the cauſe."</p>
                  <p>The treatment which they had experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in their firſt progreſs did not deter them from preparing for a ſecond. Upon a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, however, ariſing between them, but not connected with the common ſubject of their labours, they acted as wiſe and ſincere men would act; they did not retire in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt from the ſervice in which they were engaged, but, each devoting his endeavours to the advancement of the religion, they parted from one another, and ſet forwards upon ſeparate routes. The hiſtory goes along with one of them; and the ſecond enterpriſe to him was attended with the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0270800301:91"/>
ſame dangers and perſecutions as both had met with in the firſt. The apoſtle's travels hitherto had been conſined to Aſia. He now croſſes, for the firſt time, the Aegean Sea, and carries with him, amongſt others, the perſon whoſe accounts ſupply the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation we are ſtating <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 11.</note>. The firſt place in Greece at which he appears to have ſtopped was Philippi in Macedonia. Here himſelf and one of his companions were cruelly whipped, caſt into priſon, and kept there under the moſt rigorous cuſtody, being thruſt, whilſt yet ſmarting with their wounds, into the inner dungeon, and their feſt made faſt in the ſtocks <note n="†" place="bottom">V. 23, 24. 33.</note>. Notwithſtanding this unequivocal ſpecimen of the uſage which they had to look for in that country, they went forward in the execution of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. After paſſing through Amphipolis and Appollonia, they came to Theſſalonica; in which city the houſe in which they lodged was aſſailed by a party of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in order to bring them out to the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0270800301:92"/>
populace. And when, fortunately for their preſervation, they were not found at home, the maſter of the houſe was dragged before the magiſtrate for admitting them within his doors <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 1—5.</note>. Their reception at the next city was ſomething better: but neither here had they continued long before their turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent adverſaries, the Jews, excited againſt them ſuch commotions amongſt the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, as obliged the apoſtle to make his eſcape by a private journey to Athens <note n="†" place="bottom">V. 13.</note>. The extremity of the progreſs was Corinth. His abode in this city, for ſome time, ſeems to have been without moleſtation. At length, however, the Jews found means to ſtir up an inſurrection againſt him, and to bring him before the tribunal of the Roman preſident <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xviii. 12.</note>. It was to the contempt which that magiſtrate entertained for the Jews and their controverſies, of which he accounted Chriſtianity to be one, that our apoſtle owed his deliverance <note n="§" place="bottom">V. 18.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0270800301:93"/>
This indefatigable teacher, after leaving Corinth, returned by Epheſus into Syria; and again viſited Jeruſalem, and the ſociety of Chriſtians in that city, which, as hath been repeatedly obſerved, ſtill continued the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the miſſion <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xviii. 22.</note>. It ſuited not, however, with the activity of his zeal to remain long at Jeruſalem. We find him going from thence to Antioch, and, after ſome ſtay there, traverſing once more the northern provinces of Aſia Minor <note n="†" place="bottom">V. 23.</note>. This progreſs ended at Epheſus; in which city the apoſtle continued in the daily exerciſe of his miniſtry two years, and until his ſucceſs, at length, excited the apprehenſions of thoſe who were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in the ſupport of the national worſhip. Their clamour produced a tumult, in which he had nearly loſt his life <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xix. 1. 9, 10.</note>. Undiſmayed, however, by the dangers to which he ſaw himſelf expoſed, he was driven from Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus only to renew his labours in Greece <note n="§" place="bottom">V. 29. 31.</note>. After paſſing over Macedonia, he thence
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0270800301:94"/>
proceeded to his former ſtation at Corinth <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xix. 1.</note>. When he had formed his deſign of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a direct courſe from Corinth into Syria, he was compelled by a conſpiracy of the Jews, who were prepared to intercept him on his way, to trace back his ſteps through Macedonia to Philippi, and from thence to take ſhipping into Aſia. Along the coaſt of Aſia he purſued his voyage with all the expedition he could command, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reach Jeruſalem againſt the feaſt of Pentecoſt <note n="†" place="bottom">V. 16.</note>. His reception at Jeruſalem was of a piece with the uſage he had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced from the Jews in other places. He had been only a few days in that city when the populace, inſtigated by ſome of his old opponents in Aſia, who attended this feaſt, ſeized him in the temple, forced him out of it, and were ready immediately to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him, had not the ſudden preſence of the Roman guard reſcued him out of their hands <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xxi. 27—33.</note>. The officer, however, who had thus ſeaſonably interpoſed, acted from his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0270800301:95"/>
care of the public peace, with the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which he was charged, and not from any favour to the apoſtle, or indeed any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to exerciſe either juſtice or humanity towards him; for he had no ſooner ſecured his perſon in the fortreſs, than he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to examine him by torture <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xxii. 12. 24.</note>.</p>
                  <p>From this time to the concluſion of the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the apoſtle remains in public cuſtody of the Roman government. After eſcaping aſſaſſination by a fortunate diſcovery of the plot, and delivering himſelf from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his enemies by an appeal to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the emperor <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxv. 9. 11.</note>, he was ſent, but not until he had ſuffered two years impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to Rome <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xxiv. 27.</note>. He reached Italy after a tedious voyage, and after encountering in his paſſage the perils of a deſperate ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts xvii.</note>. But although ſtill a priſoner, and his fate ſtill depending, neither the various and long-continued ſufferings which he had
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0270800301:96"/>
undergone, nor the danger of his preſent ſituation, deterred him from perſiſting in preaching the religion; for the hiſtorian cloſes the account by telling us, that, for two years, he received all that came unto him in his own hired houſe, where he was permitted to dwell with a ſoldier that guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, "preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching thoſe things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with all confidence."</p>
                  <p>Now the hiſtorian, from whom we have drawn this account, in the part of his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative which relates to St. Paul, is ſupported by the ſtrongeſt corroborating teſtimony that a hiſtory can receive. We are in poſſeſſion of letters written by St. Paul himſelf upon the ſubject of his miniſtry, and either writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten during the period which the hiſtory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, or, if written afterwards, reciting and referring to the tranſactions of that period. Theſe letters, without borrowing from the hiſtory, or the hiſtory from them, uninten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally confirm the account which the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory delivers in a great variety of particulars.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0270800301:97"/>
What belongs to our preſent purpoſe is the deſcription exhibited of the apoſtle's ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and the repreſentation, given in the hiſtory, of the dangers and diſtreſſes which he underwent, not only agrees, in general, with the language which he himſelf uſes, whenever he ſpeaks of his life or miniſtry, but is alſo, in many inſtances, atteſted by a ſpecific cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency of time, place, and order of events. If the hiſtorian puts down in his narrative that at Philippi the apoſtle "was beaten with many ſtripes, caſt into priſon, and there treated with rigour and indignity <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 24.</note>," we find him, in a letter <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. ii. 2.</note> to a neighbouring church, reminding his converts, that, "after he had ſuffered before, and was ſhamefully intreated at Philippi, he was bold, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to ſpeak unto them (to whoſe city he next came) the Goſpel of God." If the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory relate <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 57.</note>, that, at Theſſalonica, the houſe in which the apoſtle was lodged, when he firſt came to that place, was aſſaulted by the populace, and the maſter of it dragged before
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0270800301:98"/>
the magiſtrate for admitting ſuch a gueſt within his doors, the apoſtle, in his letters to the Chriſtians of Theſſalonica, calls to their remembrance "how they had received the Goſpel in much affliction." If the hiſtory deliver an account of an inſurrection at Epheſus, which had nearly coſt the apoſtle his l fe, we have the apoſtle himſelf, in a letter written a ſhort time after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from that city, deſcribing his deſpair, and returning thanks for his deliverance <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>Acts xix.</p> 
                        <p>2 Cor. i. 8, 9.</p>
                     </note>. If the hiſtory inform us, that the apoſtle was expelled from Antioch in Piſidia, attempted to be ſtoned at Iconium, and actually ſtoned at Lyſtra, there is preſerved a letter from him to a favorite convert, whom, as the ſame hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory tells us, he firſt met with in theſe parts; in which letter he appeals to that diſciple's knowledge "of the perſecutions which befell him at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lyſtra <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                        <p>Acts xiii. 50. xix. 5. 19.</p>

                     </note>." If the hiſtory make the apoſtle, in his ſpeech to the Epheſian elders, remind them, as one <note place="bottom">1 Theſſ. i. 6.</note>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0270800301:99"/>
proof of the diſintereſtedneſs of his views, that, to their knowledge, he had ſupplied his own and the neceſſities of his companions by perſonal labour <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xx. 34.</note>, we find the ſame apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in a letter written during his reſidence at Epheſus, aſſerting of himſelf, "that even to that hour he laboured, working with his own hands <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. iv. 11, 12.</note>."</p>
                  <p>Theſe coincidences, together with many relative to other parts of the apoſtle's hiſtory, and <hi>all</hi> drawn from independent ſources, not only confirm the truth of the account, in the particular points as to which they are obſerved, but add much to the credit of the narrative in all its parts; and ſupport the author's profeſſion of being a contemporary of the perſon whoſe hiſtory he writes, and, throughout a material portion of his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, a companion.</p>
                  <p>What the epiſtles of the apoſtles declare of the ſuffering ſtate of Chriſtianity, the writings
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0270800301:100"/>
which remain of their companions, and immediate followers, expreſsly confirm.</p>
                  <p>Clement, who is honourably mentioned by St. Paul in his Epiſtle to the Philippians <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts iv. 3.</note>, hath left us his atteſtation to this point in the following words: "Let us take (ſays he) the examples of our own age. Through zeal and envy the moſt faithful and righteous pillars of the church have been perſecuted even to the moſt grievous deaths. Let us ſet before our eyes <hi>the holy apoſtles.</hi> Peter, by unjuſt envy, underwent, not one or two, but many ſufferings; till at laſt being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred, he went to the place of glory that was due unto him. For the ſame cauſe did Paul, in like manner, receive the reward of his patience. Seven times he was in bonds; he was whipped, was ſtoned; he preached both in the eaſt and in the weſt, leaving behind him the glorious report of his faith: and ſo having taught the whole world righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and for that end travelled even
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0270800301:101"/>
unto the utmoſt bounds of the weſt, he at laſt ſuffered martyrdom by the command of the governors, and departed out of the world, and went unto his holy place, being become a moſt eminent pattern of patience unto all ages. To theſe holy apoſtles were joined a very great number of others, who, having through envy undergone, in like manner, many pains and torments, have left a glorious example to us. For this, not only men, but women, have been perſecuted; and having ſuffered very grievous and cruel puniſhments, have finiſhed the courſe of their faith with firmneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">Clem. ad Cor. c. v. vi. Abp. Wake's tranſ.</note>."</p>
                  <p>Hermas, ſaluted by St. Paul in his Epiſtle to the Romans, in a piece very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with hiſtorical recitals, thus ſpeaks—"Such as have believed and ſuffered death for the name of Chriſt, and have endured with a ready mind, and have given up their lives with all their hearts <note n="†" place="bottom">Shepherd of Hermas, c. xxviii.</note>."</p>

                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0270800301:102"/>
Polycarp, the diſciple of John, though all that remains of his works be a very ſhort epiſtle, has not left this ſubject unnoticed.—"I exhort (ſays he) all of you, that ye obey the word of righteouſneſs, and exerciſe all patience, which ye have ſeen ſet forth before your eyes, not only in the bleſſed Ignatius, and Lorimus and Rufus, but in others among yourſelves, and in <hi>Paul himſelf and the reſt of the apoſtles;</hi> being confident in this, that all theſe have not run in vain, but in faith and righteouſneſs; and are gone to the place that was due to them from the Lord, with whom alſo they ſuffered. For they loved not this preſent world, but him who died and was raiſed again by God for us <note n="*" place="bottom">Pol. ad Phil. c. ix.</note>."</p>
                  <p>Ignatius, the contemporary of Polycarp, recognizes the ſame topic, briefly indeed, but poſitively and preciſely. "For this cauſe <hi>(i.e.</hi> for having felt and handled Chriſt's body after his reſurrection, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, as Ignatius expreſſes it, both by his

                  <p>Would the reader know what a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe days was, I would refer him to a circular letter, written by the church of Smyrna ſoon after the death of Polycarp, who, it will be remembered, had lived with St. John; and which letter is entitled a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that biſhop's martyrdom. "The ſufferings (ſay they) of all the other martyrs were bleſſed and generous, which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent according to the will of God.

                  <p>UPON the hiſtory, of which the laſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contains an abſtract, there are a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which it may be proper to make, by way of applying its teſtimony to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular propoſitions for which we contend.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Although our ſcripture hiſtory leaves the general account of the apoſtles in an early part of the narrative, and proceeds with the ſeparate account of one particular
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0270800301:106"/>
apoſtle, yet the information which it delivers ſo far extends to the reſt, as it ſhews <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſervice.</hi> When we ſee one apoſtle ſuffering perſecution in the diſcharge of his commiſſion, we ſhall not believe, without evidence, that the ſame office could, at the ſame time, be attended with eaſe and ſafety to others. And this fair and reaſonable infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is confirmed by the direct atteſtation of the letters, to which we have ſo often refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The writer of theſe letters not only alludes, in numerous paſſages, to his own ſufferings, but ſpeaks of the reſt of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as enduring like ſufferings with himſelf. "I think that God hath ſet forth <hi>us the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> laſt, as it were, appointed to death; for we are made a ſpectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men—even unto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hour, we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place; and labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bleſs; being perſecuted, we ſuffer it; being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0270800301:107"/>
unto this day <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. iv. et ſeq.</note>." Add to which, that in the ſhort account that is given of the other apoſtles, in the former part of the hiſtory, and within the ſhort period which that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count compriſes, we find, firſt, two of them ſeized, impriſoned, brought before the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, and threatened with further puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts iv. 3. 21.</note>; then, the whole number impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beaten <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts v. 18. 40.</note>: ſoon afterwards, one of their adherents ſtoned to death, and ſo hot a perſecution raiſed againſt the ſect, as to drive moſt of them out of the place; a ſhort time only ſucceeding, before one of the twelve was beheaded, and another ſentenced to the ſame fate; and all this paſſing in the ſingle city of Jeruſalem, and within ten years after the founder's death, and the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inſtitution.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Secondly; We take no credit at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for the miraculous part of the narrative, nor do we inſiſt upon the correctneſs of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle paſſages of it. If the whole ſtory be not a novel, a romance; the whole action a dream; if Peter, and James and Paul, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0270800301:108"/>
the reſt of the apoſtles, mentioned in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, be not all imaginary perſons; if their letters be not all forgeries, and, what is more, forgeries of names and characters which never exiſted; then is there evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our hands ſufficient to ſupport the only fact we contend for (and which, I repeat again, is, in itſelf, highly probable), that the original followers of Jeſus Chriſt exerted great endeavours to propagate his religion, and underwent great labours, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſufferings, in conſequence of their undertaking.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The general reality of the apoſtolic hiſtory is ſtrongly confirmed by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that it, in truth, does no more than aſſign adequate cauſes for effects which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were produced, and deſcribe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences naturally reſulting from ſituations which certainly exiſted. The <hi>effects</hi> were certainly there, of which this hiſtory ſets forth the cauſe, and origin, and progreſs. It is acknowledged on all hands, becauſe it is recorded by other teſtimony than that of the Chriſtians themſelves, that the religion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0270800301:109"/>
began to prevail at that time, and in that country. It is very difficult to conceive how it could begin, or prevail at all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the exertions of the founder and his followers in propagating the new perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The hiſtory now in our hands deſcribes theſe exertions, the perſons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, the means and endeavours made uſe of, and the labours undertaken in the proſecution of this purpoſe. Again, the treatment which the hiſtory repreſents the firſt propagators of the religion to have experienced, was no other than what natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reſulted from the ſituation in which they were confeſſedly placed. It is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the religion was adverſe, in a great degree, to the reigning opinions, and to the hopes and wiſhes of the nation to which it was firſt introduced; and that it overthrew, ſo far as it was received, the eſtabliſhed theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and worſhip of every other country. We cannot feel much reluctance in believing that, when the meſſengers of ſuch a ſyſtem went about not only publiſhing their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but collecting proſelytes, and forming
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0270800301:110"/>
regular ſocieties of proſelytes, they ſhould meet with oppoſition in their attempts, or that this oppoſition ſhould ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to fatal extremities. Our hiſtory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails examples of this oppoſition, and of the ſufferings and dangers which the emiſſaries of the religion underwent, perfectly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what might reaſonably be expected, from the nature of their undertaking, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the character of the age and country in which it was carried on.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Fourthly; The records before us ſupply evidence of what formed another member of our general propoſition, and what, as hath already been obſerved, is highly probable, and almoſt a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their new profeſſion, viz. that, together with activity and courage in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the religion, the primitive followers of Jeſus aſſumed, upon their converſion, a new and peculiar courſe of private life. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after their maſter was withdrawn from them, we hear of their "continuing with one accord in prayer and ſupplication
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0270800301:111"/>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts i. 14.</note>," of their "continuing daily with one accord in the temple <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts ii. 46.</note>," of "many being gathered together praying <note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xii. 12.</note>." We know what ſtrict injunctions were laid upon the converts by their teachers. Wherever they came, the firſt word of their preaching was, "Repent!" We know that theſe injunctions obliged them to refrain from many ſpecies of licentiouſneſs, which were not, at that time, reputed criminal. We know the rules of purity, and the maxims of benevolence, which Chriſtians read in their books; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which rules, it is enough to obſerve, that, if they were, I will not ſay, completely obeyed, but in any degree regarded, they would produce a ſyſtem of conduct, and, what is more difficult to preſerve, a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, and a regulation of affections, different from any thing to which they had hitherto been accuſtomed, and different from what they would ſee in others. The change and diſtinction of manners, which reſulted
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0270800301:112"/>
from their new character, is perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to in the letters of their teachers. "And you hath he quickened, who <hi>were</hi> dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, wherein in <hi>times paſt</hi> ye walked, according to the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the children of diſobedience; among whom alſo we had our converſation in times paſt, in the luſts of our fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 1—3. ſee alſo Tit. iii. 3.</note>."—"For the <hi>time paſt of our life</hi> may ſuffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, luſt, exceſs of wine, revellings, banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and abominable idolatries, <hi>wherein they think it ſtrange that ye run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. iv. 3, 4.</note>." St. Paul, in his firſt letter to the Corinthians, after enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, as his manner was, a catalogue of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious characters, adds, "Such <hi>were</hi> ſome
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0270800301:113"/>
of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. vi 11.</note>." In like manner, and alluding to the ſame change of practices and ſentiment, he aſks the Roman Chriſtians "what fruit they had in thoſe things whereof they are <hi>now</hi> aſhamed <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 21.</note>?" The phraſes which the ſame writer employs to deſcribe the moral condition of Chriſtians, compared with their condition before they became Chriſtians, ſuch as "newneſs of life," being "freed from ſin," being "dead to ſin;" "the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the body of ſin, that, <hi>for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> they ſhould not ſerve ſin;" "children of light and of the day," as oppoſed to "chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darkneſs and of the night," "not ſleeping as others," imply, at leaſt, a new ſyſtem of obligation, and, probably, a new ſeries of conduct, commencing with their converſion.</p>
                  <p>The teſtimony which Pliny bears to the behaviour of the new ſect in his time, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0270800301:114"/>
which teſtimony comes not more than fifty years after that of St. Paul, is very applicable to the ſubject under conſideration. The character which this writer gives of the Chriſtians of that age, and which was drawn from a pretty accurate enquiry, becauſe he conſidered their moral principles as the point in which the magiſtrate was intereſted, is as follows:—He tells the emperor, "that ſome of thoſe who had relinquiſhed the ſociety, or who, to ſave themſelves, pretended that they had relinquiſhed it, affirmed that they were wont to meet together, on a ſtated day, before it was light, and ſung among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alternately a hymn to Chriſt as a God; and to bind themſelves, by an oath, not to the commiſſion of any wickedneſs, but that they would not be guilty of theft or robbery, or adultery; that they would never falſify their word, nor deny a pledge committed to them, when called upon to return it." This proves that a morality, more pure and ſtrict than was ordinary, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed at that time in Chriſtian ſocieties.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0270800301:115"/>
And to me it appears, that we are authoriſed to carry this teſtimony back to the age of the apoſtles; becauſe it is not probable that the immediate hearers and diſciples of Chriſt were more relaxed than their ſucceſſors in Pliny's time, or the miſſionaries of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion than thoſe whom they taught.</p>

                  <head type="sub">There is ſatisfactory evidence that many, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to have been original witneſſes of the Chriſtian miracles, paſſed their lives in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, dangers, and ſufferings, voluntarily undergone in atteſtation of the accounts which they delivered, and ſolely in conſequence of their belief of the truth of thoſe accounts; and that they alſo ſubmitted, from the ſame motives, to new rules of conduct.</head>
                  <p>WHEN we conſider, firſt, the prevalency of the religion at this hour; ſecondly, the only credible account which can be given of its origin, viz. the activity of the founder and his aſſociates; thirdly, the oppoſition which that activity muſt naturally have excited; fourthly, the fate of the founder of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, atteſted by heathen writers as well as our own; fifthly, the teſtimony of the ſame writers to the ſufferings of Chriſtians, either contemporary with, or immediately ſucceeding,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0270800301:117"/>
the original ſettlers of the inſtitution; ſixthly, predictions of the ſufferings of his followers aſcribed to the founder of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which aſcription alone proves, either that ſuch predictions were delivered and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, or that the writers of Chriſt's life were induced by the event to attribute ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to him; ſeventhly, letters now in our poſſeſſion, written by ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal agents in the tranſaction, referring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly to extreme labours, dangers, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſuſtained by themſelves and their companions; laſtly, a hiſtory, purporting to be written by a fellow traveller of one of the new teachers, and, by its unſophiſticated correſpondency with letters of that perſon ſtill extant, proving itſelf to be written by ſome one well acquainted with the ſubject of the narrative, which hiſtory contains accounts of travels, perſecutions, and martyrdoms, anſwering to what the former reaſons lead us to expect: when we lay together theſe conſiderations, which, taken ſeparately, are, I think, correctly ſuch as I have ſtated them in the preceding chapters, there cannot much
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0270800301:118"/>
doubt remain upon our minds, but that a number of perſons at that time appeared in the world, publicly advancing an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtory, and, for the ſake of propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the belief of that ſtory, voluntarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring great perſonal dangers, traverſing ſeas and kingdoms, exerting great induſtry, and ſuſtaining great extremities of ill uſage and perſecution. It is alſo proved that the ſame perſons, in conſequence of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, or pretended perſuaſion of the truth of what they aſſerted, entered upon a courſe of life in many reſpects new and ſingular.</p>
                  <p>From the clear and acknowledged parts of the caſe, I think it to be likewiſe in the higheſt degree probable, that the ſtory, for which theſe perſons voluntarily expoſed themſelves to the fatigues and hardſhips which they endured, was a <hi>miraculous</hi> ſtory; I mean, that they pretended to miraculous evidence of ſome kind or other. They had nothing elſe to ſtand upon. The deſignation of the perſon, that is to ſay, that Jeſus of Nazareth, rather than any other perſon, was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0270800301:119"/>
the Meſſiah, and, as ſuch, the ſubject of their miniſtry, could only be founded upon ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural tokens attributed to him. Here were no victories, no conqueſts, no revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, no ſurpriſing elevation of fortune, no achievements of valour, of ſtrength, or of policy, to appeal to; no diſcoveries in any art or ſcience, no great efforts of genius or learning to produce. A Galilean peaſant was announced to the world as a divine law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver. A young man of mean condition, of a private and ſimple life, and who had wrought no deliverance for the Jewiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was declared to be their Meſſiah. This, without aſcribing to him at the ſame time ſome proofs of his miſſion, (and what other but ſupernatural proofs could there be?) was too abſurd a claim to be either imagined, or attempted, or credited. In whatever degree, or in whatever part, the religion was <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative,</hi> when it came to the queſtion, "is the carpenter's ſon of Nazareth the perſon whom we are to receive and obey?" there was nothing but the miracles attributed to him, by which his pretenſions could be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0270800301:120"/>
maintained for a moment. Every contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy and every queſtion muſt preſuppoſe theſe; for, however ſuch controverſies, when they did ariſe, might, and naturally would, be diſcuſſed upon their own grounds of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, without citing the miraculous evidence which had been aſſerted to attend the founder of the religion (which would have been to enter upon another, and a more general, queſtion), yet we are to bear in mind, that, without previouſly ſuppoſing the exiſtence or the pretence of ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, there could have been no place for the diſcuſſion or the argument at all. Thus, for example, whether the prophecies, which the Jews interpreted to belong to the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, were, or were not, applicable to the hiſtory of Jeſus of Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>areth, was a natural ſubject of debate in thoſe times: and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate would proceed, without recurring at every turn to his miracles, becauſe it ſet out with ſuppoſing theſe; inaſmuch as without miraculous marks and tokens (real or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended), or without ſome ſuch great change effected by his means in the public condition
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0270800301:121"/>
of the country, as might have ſatisfied the then received interpretation of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, I do not ſee how the queſtion could ever have been entertained. Apollos, we read, "mightily convinced the Jews, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the ſcriptures that Jeſus was Chriſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xviii. 28.</note>;" but unleſs Jeſus had exhibited ſome diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his perſon, ſome proof of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power, the argument from the old ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures could have had no place. It had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to attach upon. A young man, calling himſelf the Son of God, gathering a crowd about him, and delivering to them lectures of morality, could not have excited ſo much as a doubt amongſt the Jews whether he was the object in whom a long ſeries of ancient prophecies terminated, from the completion of which they had formed ſuch magnificent expectations, and expectations of a nature ſo oppoſite to what appeared: I mean, no ſuch doubt could exiſt when they had the whole caſe before them, when they ſaw him put to death for his officiouſneſs, and when by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0270800301:122"/>
his death the evidence concerning him was cloſed. Again, the <hi>effect</hi> of the Meſſiah's coming, ſuppoſing Jeſus to have been him, upon Jews, upon Gentiles, upon their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to each other, upon their acceptance with God, upon their duties and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; his nature, authority, office, and agency; were likely to become ſubjects of much conſideration with the early votaries of the religion, and to occupy their attention and writings. I ſhould not, however, expect, that in theſe diſquiſitions, whether preſerved in the form of letters, ſpeeches, or ſet trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, frequent or very direct mention of his miracles would occur. Still miraculous evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence lay at the bottom of the argument. In the <hi>primary</hi> queſtion, miraculous preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and miraculous pretenſions alone, were what they had to rely upon.</p>
                  <p>That the original ſtory was miraculous, is very fairly alſo inferred from the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous powers which were laid claim to by the Chriſtians of ſucceeding ages. If the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of theſe miracles be true, it was a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0270800301:123"/>
continuation of the ſame powers; if they be falſe, it was an <hi>imitation,</hi> I will not ſay, of what had been wrought, but of what had been reported to have been wrought, by thoſe who preceded them. That imitation ſhould follow reality; fiction be grafted upon truth; that if miracles were performed at firſt, miracles ſhould be pretended after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, agrees ſo well with the ordinary courſe of human affairs, that we can have no great difficulty in believing it. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſuppoſition is very improbable, namely, that miracles ſhould be pretended to by the followers of the apoſtles and firſt emiſſaries of the religion, when none were pretended to, either in their own perſons or that of their maſter, by theſe apoſtles and emiſſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                  <p>IT once then being proved, that the firſt propagators of the Chriſtian inſtitution did exert great activity, and ſubject themſelves to great dangers and ſufferings, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and for the ſake of an extraordinary, and I think we may ſay, of a miraculous ſtory of ſome kind or other; the next great queſtion is, Whether the account, which our ſcriptures contain, be that ſtory; that which theſe men delivered, and for which they acted and ſuffered as they did?</p>

This queſtion is, in effect, no other than, whether the ſtory which Chriſtians have <hi>now,</hi> be the ſtory which Chriſtians had <hi>then?</hi> and of this the following proofs may be deduced from general conſiderations, and from conſiderations prior to any enquiry into the particular reaſons and teſtimonies by which the authority of our hiſtories is ſupported.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, there exiſts no trace or veſtige of any other ſtory. It is not, like the death of Cyrus the Great, a competition between oppoſite accounts, or between the credit of different hiſtorians. There is not a document, or ſcrap of account, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with the commencement of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, or extant within many ages after that commencement, which aſſigns a hiſtory ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially different from ours. The remote, brief, and incidental notices of the affair, which are found in heathen writers, ſo far as they do go, go along with us. They bear teſtimony to theſe facts; that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution originated from Jeſus; that the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0270800301:126"/>
founder was put to death, as a malefactor, at Jeruſalem, by the authority of the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate; that the religion nevertheleſs ſpread in that city, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Judea; and that it was propagated from thence to diſtant countries; that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were numerous; that they ſuffered great hardſhips and injuries for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and that all this took place in the age of the world which our books have aſſigned. They go on further, to deſcribe the <hi>manners</hi> of Chriſtians in terms perfectly conformable to the accounts extant in our books; that they were wont to aſſemble on a certain day; that they ſung hymns to Chriſt as to a god; that they bound themſelves by an oath not to commit any crime, but to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from theft and adultery, to adhere ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their promiſes, and not to deny money depoſited in their hands <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Pliny's Letter.

them that they were all brethren; that they had a great contempt for the things of this world, and looked upon them as common; that they flew to one another's relief; that they cheriſhed ſtrong hopes of immortality; that they deſpiſed death, and ſurrendered themſelves to ſufferings <note n="*" place="bottom">"It is incredible what expedition they uſe when any of their friends are known to be in trouble.

of ſuch an account upon the face of it, becauſe it deſcribes effects, namely, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the world of a new religion, and the converſion of great multitudes to it, without deſcending, in the ſmalleſt degree, to the detail of the tranſaction upon which it was founded, the interior of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the evidence or arguments offered by thoſe who drew over others to it. Yet ſtill here is no contradiction of our ſtory; no other or different ſtory ſet up againſt it; but ſo far a confirmation of it, as that, in the general points upon which the heathen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count touches, it agrees with that which we find in our own books.</p>
                  <p>The ſame may be obſerved of the very few Jewiſh writers, of that and the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing period, which have come down to us. Whatever they omit, or whatever difficulties we may find in explaining the omiſſion, they advance no other hiſtory of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action than that which we acknowledge. Joſephus, who wrote his antiquities, or hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Jews, about ſixty years after the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0270800301:129"/>
commencement of Chriſtianity, in a paſſage generally admitted as genuine, makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of John under the name of John the Baptiſt; that he was a preacher of virtue; that he baptized his proſelytes; that he was well received by the people; that he was impriſoned and put to death by Herod; and that Herod lived in a criminal cohabitation with Herodias, his brother's wife <note n="*" place="bottom">Antiq. l. xviii. cap. v. ſect. 1, 2.</note>. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other paſſage, allowed by many, although not without conſiderable queſtion being moved about it, we hear of "James, the brother of him who was called Jeſus, and of his being put to death <note n="†" place="bottom">Antiq. l. xx. cap. ix. ſect. 1.</note>." In a third paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, extant in every copy that remains of Joſephus's hiſtory, but the authenticity of which has nevertheleſs been long diſputed, we have an explicit teſtimony to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our hiſtory in theſe words:—"At that time lived Jeſus, a wiſe man, if he may be called a man, for he performed many wonderful works. He was a teacher of ſuch
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0270800301:130"/>
men as received the truth with pleaſure. He drew over to him many Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. This was the Chriſt; and when Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, at the inſtigation of the chief men among us, had condemned him to the croſs, they, who before had conceived an affection for him, did not ceaſe to adhere to him; for on the third day he appeared to them alive again, the divine prophets having foretold theſe and many wonderful things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. And the ſect of the Chriſtians, ſo called from him, ſubſiſts to this time <note n="*" place="bottom">Antiq. l. xviii. cap. iii. ſect. 3.</note>." Whatever become of the controverſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the genuineneſs of this paſſage; whether Joſephus go the whole length of our hiſtory, which, if the paſſage be ſincere, he does; or whether he proceed only a very little way with us, which, if the paſſage be rejected, we confeſs to be the caſe; ſtill what we aſſerted is true, that he gives no other or different hiſtory of the ſubject from ours, no other or different account of the origin of the inſtitution. And I think alſo
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0270800301:131"/>
that it may with great reaſon be contended, either that the paſſage is genuine, or that the ſilence of Joſephus was <hi>deſigned.</hi> For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſhould lay aſide the authority of our own books entirely, yet when Tacitus, who wrote not twenty, perhaps not ten, years after Joſephus, in his account of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod in which Joſephus was near thirty years of age, tells us, that a vaſt multitude of Chriſtians were condemned at Rome; that they derived their denomination from Chriſt, who, in the reign of Tiberius, was put to death, as a criminal, by the procurator Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate; that the ſuperſtition had ſpread not only over Judea, the ſource of the evil, but had reached Rome alſo: — when Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, an hiſtorian contemporary with Tacitus, relates, that, in the time of Claudius, the Jews were making diſturbances at Rome, Chreſtus being their leader; and that, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reign of Nero, the Chriſtians were puniſhed; under both which emperors Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus lived:—when Pliny, who wrote his celebrated epiſtle not more than thirty years after the publication of Joſephus's
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0270800301:132"/>
hiſtory, found the Chriſtians in ſuch numbers in the province of Bithynia as to draw from him a complaint, that the contagion had ſeized cities, towns, and villages, and had ſo ſeized them as to produce a general deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the public rites; and when, as hath already been obſerved, there is no reaſon for imagining that the Chriſtians were more numerous in Bithynia than in many other parts of the Roman empire: it cannot, I ſhould ſuppoſe, after this, be believed, that the religion, and the tranſaction upon which it was founded, were too obſcure to engage the attention of Joſephus, or to obtain a place in his hiſtory. Perhaps he did not know how to repreſent the buſineſs, and diſpoſed of his difficulties by paſſing it over in ſilence. Euſebius wrote the life of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, yet omits entirely the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able circumſtance in that life, the death of his ſon Criſpus; undoubtedly for the reaſon here given. The reſerve of Joſephus upon the ſubject of Chriſtianity appears alſo in his paſſing over the baniſhment of the Jews by Claudius, which Suetonius, we have ſeen,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0270800301:133"/>
has recorded with an expreſs reference to Chriſt. This is at leaſt as remarkable as his ſilence about the infants of Bethlehem <note n="*" place="bottom">Michaelis has computed, and, as it ſhould ſeem fairly enough, that probably not more than twenty children periſhed by this cruel precaution. Michael. Introd. to the N. Teſt. tranſlated by Marſh. Vol. I. c. ii. ſect. 11.</note>. Be, however, the fact, or the cauſe of the omiſſion in Joſephus <note n="†" place="bottom">There is no notice taken of Chriſtianity in the Miſhna, a collection of Jewiſh traditions compiled about the year 180, although it contains a Tract, "De cultu peregrino," of ſtrange or idolatrous worſhip; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſputed but that Chriſtianity was perfectly well known in the world at this time. There is extremely lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle notice of the ſubject in the Jeruſalem Talmud, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled about the year 300, and not much more in the Babyloniſh Talmud, of the year 500, although both theſe works are of a religious nature, and although, when the firſt was compiled, Chriſtianity was upon the point of becoming the religion of the ſtate, and, when the latter was publiſhed, had been ſo for 200 years.</note>, what it may, no other or different hiſtory of the ſubject has been given by him, or is pretended to have been given.</p>
                  <p>But farther; the whole ſeries of Chriſtian
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0270800301:134"/>
writers, from the firſt age of the inſtitution down to the preſent, in their diſcuſſions, apologies, arguments, and controverſies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon the general ſtory which our ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures contain, and upon no other. The main facts, the principal agents, are alike in all. This argument will appear to be of great force, when it is known that we are able to trace back the ſeries of writers to a contact with the hiſtorical books of the New Teſtament, and to the age of the firſt emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the religion, and to deduce it, by an unbroken continuation, from that end of the train to the preſent.</p>
                  <p>The remaining letters of the apoſtles (and what more original than <hi>their</hi> letters can we have), though written without the remoteſt deſign of tranſmitting the hiſtory of Chriſt, or of Chriſtianity, to future ages, or even of making it known to their contemporaries, incidentally diſcloſe to us the following cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: "Chriſt's deſcent and family, his innocence, the meekneſs and gentleneſs of his character (a recognition which goes

No epiſtle in the collection car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about it more indubitable marks of antiquity than this does. It ſpeaks, for inſtance, throughout, of the temple as then ſtanding, and of the worſhip of the temple as then ſubſiſting.—Heb. viii. 4. "For if he were on earth, he ſhould not be a prieſt, ſeeing there <hi>are</hi> prieſts that offer according to the law."—Again, Heb. xiii. 10.

                  <p>In an epiſtle bearing the name of Barnabas the companion of Paul, probably genuine, certainly belonging to that age, we have the ſufferings of Chriſt, his choice of apoſtles and their number, his paſſion, the ſcarlet robe, the vinegar and gall, the mocking and piercing, the caſting lots for his coat <note n="†" place="bottom">Ep. Bar. c. vii.</note>, his

reſurrection on the eighth <hi>(i. e.</hi> the firſt day of the week <note n="*" place="bottom">Ep. Bar. c. vi.</note>) and the commemorative diſtinction of that day, his manifeſtation after his reſurrection, and laſtly, his aſcenſion. We have alſo his miracles generally but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively referred to in the following words: "finally teaching the people of Iſrael, and <hi>doing many wonders and ſigns among them,</hi> he preached to them, and ſhowed the exceeding great love which he bare towards them <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. c. v.</note>."</p>
                  <p>In an epiſtle of Clement, a hearer of St. Paul, although written for a purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely connected with the Chriſtian hiſtory, we have the reſurrection of Chriſt, and the ſubſequent miſſion of the apoſtles, recorded in theſe ſatisfactory terms: "The apoſtles have preached to us from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt from God—For having received their command, and being <hi>thoroughly aſſured by the reſurrection of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they went abroad, publiſhing that the kingdom of God was at hand <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ep. Clem. Rom. c. xlii.</note>." We find noticed alſo,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0270800301:138"/>
the humility, yet the power of Chriſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Ep. Clem. Rom. c. xvi.</note>, his deſcent from Abraham, his crucifixion. We have Peter and Paul repreſented as faithful and righteous pillars of the church, the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſufferings of Peter, the bonds, ſtripes, and ſtoning of Paul, and more particularly his extenſive and unwearied travels.</p>
                  <p>In an epiſtle of Polycarp, a diſciple of St. John, though only a brief hortatory letter, we have the humility, patience, ſufferings, reſurrection, and aſcenſion of Chriſt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the apoſtolic character of St. Paul, diſtinctly recognized <note n="†" place="bottom">Pol. Ep. ad Phil. c. v. viii. ii. iii.</note>. Of this ſame father we are alſo aſſured by Irenaeus, that he (Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus) had heard him relate, "what he had received from eye-witneſſes concerning the Lord, both <hi>concerning his miracles</hi> and his doctrine <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ir. ad Flor. ap. Euſ. l. v. c. 20.</note>."</p>
                  <p>In the remaining works of Ignatius, the contemporary of Polycarp, larger than thoſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0270800301:139"/>
of Polycarp (yet, like thoſe of Polycarp, treating of ſubjects in no wiſe leading to any recital of the Chriſtian hiſtory), the occaſional alluſions are proportionably more numerous. The deſcent of Chriſt from David, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mary, his miraculous conception, the ſtar at his birth, his baptiſm by John, the reaſon aſſigned for it, his appeal to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the ointment poured on his head, his ſufferings under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, his reſurrection, the Lord's day called and kept in commemoration of it, and the Euchariſt, in both its parts, are une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocally referred to. Upon the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this writer is even circumſtantial. He mentions the apoſtles eating and drinking with Chriſt after he was riſen, their feeling and their handling him; from which laſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance Ignatius raiſes this juſt reflection—"They believed, being convinced both by his fleſh and ſpirit; for this cauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed death, and were found to be above it <note n="*" place="bottom">Ad. Smyr. c. iii.</note>."</p>

                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0270800301:140"/>
Quadratus, of the ſame age with Ignatius, has left us the following noble teſtimony:—"The works of our Saviour were always conſpicuous, for they were real: both they that were healed, and they that were raiſed from the dead: who were ſeen not only when they were healed or raiſed, but for a long time afterwards. Not only whilſt he dwelled on this earth, but alſo after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and for a good while after it, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome of them have reached to our times <note n="*" place="bottom">Ap. Euſ. H. E. I. iv. c. 3.</note>."</p>
                  <p>Juſtin Martyr came little more than thirty years after Quadratus. From Juſtin's works, which are ſtill extant, might be collected a tolerably complete account of Chriſt's life, in all points agreeing with that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in our ſcriptures; taken indeed, in a great meaſure, from thoſe ſcriptures, but ſtill proving that this account, and no other, was the account known and extant in that age. The miracles in particular, which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0270800301:141"/>
form the part of Chriſt's hiſtory moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to be traced, ſtand fully and diſtinctly recognized in the following paſſage:—"He healed thoſe who had been blind, and deaf, and lame, from their birth, cauſing, by his word, one to leap, another to hear, and a third to ſee; and by raiſing the dead, and making them to live, he induced, by his works, the men of that age to know him <note n="*" place="bottom">Juſt. Dial. cum Tryph. p. 288. cd. Thirl.</note>."</p>
                  <p>It is unneceſſary to carry theſe citations lower, becauſe the hiſtory, after this time, occurs in ancient Chriſtian writings as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly as it is wont to do in modern ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; occurs always the ſame in ſubſtance, and always that which our evangeliſts repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>This is not only true of thoſe writings of Chriſtians which are genuine, and of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged authority, but it is, in a great meaſure, true of <hi>all</hi> their ancient writings which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; although ſome of theſe may have been erroneouſly aſcribed to authors to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0270800301:142"/>
whom they did not belong, or may contain falſe accounts, or may appear to be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of credit, or never indeed to have obtained any. Whatever fables they have mixed with the narrative, they preſerve the material parts, the leading facts, as we have them; and, ſo far as they do this, although they be evidence of nothing elſe, they are evidence that theſe points were <hi>fixed,</hi> were received and acknowledged by all Chriſtians in the ages in which the books were written. At leaſt it may be aſſerted, that, in the places where we were moſt likely to meet with ſuch things, if ſuch things had exiſted, no reliques appear of any ſtory ſubſtantially different from the preſent, as the cauſe, or as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, of the inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Now that the original ſtory, the ſtory delivered by the firſt preachers of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould have died away ſo entirely as to have left no record or memorial of its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, although ſo many records and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of the time and tranſaction remain; and that another ſtory ſhould have ſtepped into
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0270800301:143"/>
its place, and gained excluſive poſſeſſion of the belief of all who profeſſed themſelves diſciples of the inſtitution, is beyond any example of the corruption of even oral tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſtill leſs conſiſtent with the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of written hiſtory: and this improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which is very great, is rendered ſtill greater by the reflection, that no ſuch <hi>change,</hi> as the oblivion of one ſtory and the ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another, took place in any future period of the Chriſtian aera. Chriſtianity hath travelled through dark and turbulent ages; nevertheleſs it came out of the cloud and the ſtorm, ſuch, in ſubſtance, as it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in. Many additions were made to the primitive hiſtory, and theſe entitled to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of credit; many doctrinal errors alſo were from time to time grafted into the public creed, but ſtill the original ſtory remained, and remained the ſame. In all its principal parts it has been fixed from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The religious rites and uſages that prevailed amongſt the early diſciples of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0270800301:144"/>
Chriſtianity, were ſuch as belonged to, and ſprung out of, the narrative now in our hands; which accordancy ſhews, that it was the narrative upon which theſe perſons acted, and which they had received from their teachers. Our account makes the founder of the religion direct that his diſciples ſhould be baptized: we know that the firſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were baptized. Our account makes him direct that they ſhould hold religious aſſemblies: we find that they did hold religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſemblies. Our accounts make the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles aſſemble upon a ſtated day in the week: we find, and that from information perfectly independent of our accounts, that the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of the firſt century did obſerve ſtated days of aſſembling. Our hiſtories record the inſtitution of the rite which we call the Lord's Supper, and a command to repeat it in perpetual ſucceſſion: we find, amongſt the early Chriſtians, the celebration of this rite univerſal. And indeed we find concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in all the above-mentioned obſervances, Chriſtian ſocieties of many different nations and languages, removed from one another
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0270800301:145"/>
by great diſtance of place and diſſimilitude of ſituation. It is alſo extremely material to remark, that there is no room for inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating that our books were fabricated with a ſtudious accommodation to the uſages which obtained at the time they were written; that the authors of the books found the uſages eſtabliſhed, and framed the ſtory to account for their original. The ſcripture accounts, eſpecially of the Lord's Supper, are too ſhort and curſory, not to ſay too obſcure, and, in this view, deficient, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a place for any ſuch ſuſpicion <note n="*" place="bottom">The reader who is converſant in theſe reſearches, by comparing the ſhort ſcripture accounts of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian rites above mentioned with the minute and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial directions contained in the pretended apoſtolical conſtitutions, will ſee the force of this obſervation; the difference between truth and forgery.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the proofs of the truth of our propoſition, viz. that the ſtory, which we have <hi>now,</hi> is, in ſubſtance, the ſtory which the Chriſtians had <hi>then,</hi> or, in other words, that the accounts in our goſpels are, as to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0270800301:146"/>
their principal parts at leaſt, the accounts which the apoſtles and original teachers of the religion delivered, one ariſes from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that it appears by the goſpels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the ſtory was public at the time; that the Chriſtian community was already in poſſeſſion of the ſubſtance and principal parts of the narrative. The goſpels were not the original cauſe of the Chriſtian hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory being believed, but were themſelves among the conſequences of that belief. This is expreſsly affirmed by St. Luke in his brief, but, as I think, very important and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive preface. "Foraſmuch (ſays the evangeliſt) as many have taken in hand to ſet forth in order a declaration of thoſe things <hi>which are moſt ſurely believed amongſt us, even as they aelivered them unto us, which, from the beginning, were eye-witneſſes and miniſters of the word;</hi> it ſeemed good to me alſo, having had perfect underſtanding of all things from the very firſt, to write unto thee in order, moſt excellent Theophilus, that thou mighteſt know the certainty of thoſe things <hi>wherein thou haſt been inſtructed."</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0270800301:147"/>
This ſhort introduction teſtifies, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the hiſtory, which the evangeliſt was about to write, was already believed by Chriſtians; that it was believed upon the declarations of eye-witneſſes and miniſters of the word; that it formed the account of their religion, in which Chriſtians were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; that the office which the hiſtorian propoſed to himſelf, was to trace each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to its origin, and to fix the certainty of many things which the reader had before heard of. In St. John's Goſpel, the ſame point appears from hence, that there are ſome principal facts, to which the hiſtorian refers, but which he does not relate. A remarkable inſtance of this kind is the <hi>aſcenſion,</hi> which is not mentioned by St. John in its place, at the concluſion of his hiſtory, but which is plainly referred to in the following words of the ſixth chapter <note n="*" place="bottom">Alſo John iii. 13. and xvi. 28.</note>: "What and if ye ſhall ſee the Son of man aſcend up where he was before." And ſtill more poſitively in the words which Chriſt, according to our evangeliſt,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0270800301:148"/>
ſpoke to Mary after his reſurrection, "Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father; but go unto my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, unto my God and your God <note n="*" place="bottom">John xx. 17.</note>." This can only be accounted for by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that St. John wrote under a ſenſe of the notoriety of Chriſt's aſcenſion, amongſt thoſe by whom his book was likely to be read. The ſame account muſt alſo be given of St. Matthew's omiſſion of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant fact. The thing was very well known, and it did not occur to the hiſtorian, that it was neceſſary to add any particulars concerning it. It agrees alſo with this ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with no other, that neither Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew nor John diſpoſe of the perſon of our Lord in any manner whatever. Other inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations in St. John's Goſpel of the then general notoriety of the ſtory are the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: His manner of introducing his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, (ch. i. v. 15.) "John bare witneſs of him, and cried, ſaying," evidently preſuppoſes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0270800301:149"/>
that his readers knew who John was. His rapid parenthetical reference to John's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, "for John was not yet caſt into priſon <note n="*" place="bottom">John iii. 24.</note>," could only come from a writer whoſe mind was in the habit of conſidering John's impriſonment as perfectly notorious. The deſcription of Andrew by the addition "Simon Peter's brother <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>Ibid. i. 40.</p>
                        <p>Ibid. xxi. 24.</p>
                     </note>," takes it for granted that Simon Peter was well known. His name had not been mentioned before. The evangeliſt's noticing ‡ the prevailing miſconſtruction of a diſcourſe, which Chriſt held with the beloved diſciple, proves that the characters and the diſcourſe were already public. And the obſervation which theſe inſtances afford, is of equal validity for the purpoſe of the preſent argument, whoever were the authors of the hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>THESE <hi>four</hi> circumſtances, firſt, the recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the account in its principal parts by a ſeries of ſucceeding writers; ſecondly, the total abſence of any account of the origin of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0270800301:150"/>
the religion ſubſtantially different from ours; thirdly, the early and extenſive prevalence of rites and inſtitutions, which reſult from our account; fourthly, our account bearing, in its conſtruction, proof that it is an account of facts, which were known and believed at the time; are ſufficient, I conceive, to ſupport an aſſurance, that the ſtory, which we have now, is, in general, the ſtory which Chriſtians had at the beginning. I ſay <hi>in general;</hi> by which term I mean, that it is the ſame in its texture, and in its principal facts. For inſtance, I make no doubt, for the reaſons above ſtated, but that the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the founder of the religion was always a part of the Chriſtian ſtory. Nor can a doubt of this remain upon the mind of any one, who reflects that the reſurrection is, in ſome form or other, aſſerted, referred to, or aſſumed, in every Chriſtian writing, of every deſcription, which hath come down to us.</p>
                  <p>And if our evidence ſtopped here, we ſhould have a ſtrong caſe to offer: for we ſhould
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0270800301:151"/>
have to alledge, that, in the reign of Tiberius Caeſar, a certain number of perſons ſet about an attempt of eſtabliſhing a new religion in the world; in the proſecution of which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they voluntarily encountered great dangers, undertook great labours, ſuſtained great ſufferings, all <hi>for</hi> a miraculous ſtory which they publiſhed wherever they came; and that the reſurrection of a dead man, whom, during his life, they had followed and accompanied, was a conſtant part of this ſtory. I know nothing in the above ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which can, with any appearance of reaſon, be diſputed; and I know nothing in the hiſtory of the human ſpecies ſimilar to it.</p>

                  <head type="sub">There is ſatisfactory evidence, that many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, profeſſing to have been original witneſſes of the Chriſtian miracles, paſſed their lives in labours, dangers, and ſufferings, voluntarily undergone in atteſtation of the accounts which they delivered, and ſolely in conſequence of their belief of the truth of thoſe accounts; and that they alſo ſubmitted, from the ſame motives, to new rules of conduct.</head>
                  <p>THAT the ſtory which we have now is, in the main, the ſtory which the apoſtles pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, is, I think, nearly certain from the conſiderations which have been propoſed. But whether, when we come to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and the detail of the narrative, the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical books of the New Teſtament be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of credit as hiſtories, ſo that a fact ought to be accounted true becauſe it is found in them; or whether they are entitled to be conſidered as repreſenting the accounts,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0270800301:153"/>
which, true or ſalſe, the apoſtles publiſhed; whether their authority, in either of theſe views, can be truſted to, is a point which neceſſarily depends upon what we know of the books, and of their authors.</p>
                  <p>Now, in treating of this part of our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the firſt, and a moſt material, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon the ſubject is, that, ſuch was the ſituation of the authors to whom the four goſpels are aſcribed, that, if any one of the four be genuine, it is ſufficient for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The received author of the firſt was an original apoſtle and emiſſary of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The received author of the ſecond was an inhabitant of Jeruſalem at the time, to whoſe houſe the apoſtles were wont to reſort, and himſelf an attendant upon one of the moſt eminent of that number. The received author of the third was a ſtated companion and fellow traveller of the moſt active of all the teachers of the religion, and in the courſe of his travels frequently in the ſociety of the original apoſtles. The received author of the fourth, as well as of the firſt,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0270800301:154"/>
was one of theſe apoſtles. No ſtronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of a hiſtory can ariſe from the ſituation of the hiſtorian than what is here offered. The authors of all the hiſtories lived at the time and upon the ſpot. The authors of two of the hiſtories were preſent at many of the ſcenes which they deſcribe; eye-witneſſes of the facts, ear-witneſſes of the diſcourſes; writing from perſonal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and recollection, and, what ſtrengthens their teſtimony, writing upon a ſubject in which their minds were deeply engaged, and in which, as they muſt have been very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeating the accounts to others, the paſſages of the hiſtory would be kept conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually alive in their memory. Whoever reads the goſpels (and they ought to be read for this particular purpoſe) will find in them not merely a general affirmation of miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous powers, but detailed circumſtantial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of miracles, with ſpecifications of time, place, and perſons; and theſe accounts many and various. In the Goſpels, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which bear the names of Matthew and John, theſe narratives, if they really proceeded
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0270800301:155"/>
from theſe men, muſt either be true, as far as the ſidelity of human recollection is uſually to be depended upon, that is, muſt be true in ſubſtance, and in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts (which is ſufficient for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of proving a ſupernatural agency), or they muſt be wilful and meditated falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. Yet the writers who fabricated and uttered theſe falſehoods, if they be ſuch are of the number of thoſe who, unleſs the whole contexture of the Chriſtian ſtory be a dream, ſacrificed their eaſe and ſafety in the cauſe, and for a purpoſe the moſt inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that is poſſible with diſhoneſt intentions. They were villains for no end but to teach honeſty, and martyrs without the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of honour or advantage.</p>
                  <p>The goſpels which bear the name of Mark and Luke, although not the narratives of eye-witneſſes, are, if genuine, removed from that only by one degree. They are the narratives of contemporary writers, of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves mixing with the buſineſs, one of the two probably living in the place
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0270800301:156"/>
which was the principal ſcene of action, both living in habits of ſociety and correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with thoſe who had been preſent at the tranſactions which they relate. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them accordingly tells us (and with apparent ſincerity, becauſe he tells it without pretending to perſonal knowledge, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out claiming for his work greater authority than belonged to it), that the things, which were believed amongſt Chriſtians, came from thoſe who from the beginning were eye-witneſſes and miniſters of the word; that he had traced up accounts to their ſource; and that he was prepared to inſtruct his reader in the certainty of the things which he related <note n="*" place="bottom">Why ſhould not the candid and modeſt preface of this hiſtorian be believed as well as that which Dion Caſſius prefixes to his Life of Commodus? "Theſe things and the following I write not from the report of others, but from my own knowledge and obſervation." I ſee no reaſon to doubt but that both paſſages deſcribe truly enough the ſituation of the authors.</note>. Very few hiſtories lie ſo cloſe to their facts; very few hiſtorians are ſo nearly connected with the ſubject of their narrative,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0270800301:157"/>
or poſſeſs ſuch means of authentic informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as theſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſituation of the writers applies to the <hi>truth</hi> of the facts which they record. But at preſent we uſe their teſtimony to a point ſomewhat ſhort of this, namely, that the facts recorded in the goſpels, whether true or falſe, are the facts, and the ſort of facts, which the original preachers of the religion alledged. Strictly ſpeaking, I am concerned only to ſhew, that what the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels contain is the ſame as what the apoſtles preached. Now how ſtands the proof of this point? A ſet of men went about the world publiſhing a ſtory compoſed of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous accounts (for miraculous from the very nature and exigency of the caſe they muſt have been), and, upon the ſtrength of theſe accounts, called upon mankind to quit the religions in which they had been educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to take up, from thenceforth, a new ſyſtem of opinions, and new rules of action. What is more, in atteſtation of theſe accounts, that is, in ſupport of an inſtitution of which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0270800301:158"/>
theſe accounts were the foundation, the ſame men voluntarily expoſed themſelves to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing and perpetual labours, dangers, and ſufferings. We want to know what theſe accounts were. We have the particulars, <hi>i. e.</hi> many particulars, from two of their own number. We have them from an attendant of one of the number, and who there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe was an inhabitant of Jeruſalem at the time. We have them from a fourth writer, who accompanied the moſt laborious miſſionary of the inſtitution in his travels; who, in the courſe of theſe travels, was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently brought into the ſociety of the reſt; and who, let it be obſerved, begins his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by telling us, that he is about to relate the things which had been delivered by thoſe who were miniſters of the word and eye-witneſſes of the fact. I do not know what information can be more ſatisfactory than this. We may, perhaps, perceive the force and value of it more ſenſibly, if we reflect how <hi>requiring</hi> we ſhould have been if we had wanted it. Suppoſing it to be ſufficiently proved, that the religion, now
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0270800301:159"/>
profeſſed amongſt us, owed its original to the preaching and miniſtry of a number of men, who, about eighteen centuries ago, ſet forth in the world a new ſyſtem of religious opinions, founded upon certain extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things which they related of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon who had appeared in Judea: ſuppoſe it to be alſo ſufficiently proved, that, in the courſe and proſecution of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, theſe men had ſubjected themſelves to extreme hardſhips, fatigue, and peril; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the accounts which they publiſhed had not been committed to writing till ſome ages after their times, or at leaſt that no hiſtories, but what had been compoſed ſome ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, had reached our hands; we ſhould have ſaid, and with reaſon, that we were willing to believe theſe men under the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in which they delivered their teſtimony, but that we did not, at this day, know with ſufficient evidence what their teſtimony was. Had we received the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of it from any of their own number, from any of thoſe who lived and converſed with them, from any of their hearers, or even
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0270800301:160"/>
from any of their contemporaries, we ſhould have had ſomething to rely upon. Now, if our books be genuine, we have all theſe. We have the very ſpecies of information which, as it appears to me, our imagination would have carved out for us, if it had been wanting.</p>
                  <p>But I have ſaid, that, if <hi>any one</hi> of the four goſpels be genuine, we have not only direct hiſtorical teſtimony to the point we contend for, but teſtimony which, ſo far as that point is concerned, cannot reaſonably be rejected. If the firſt goſpel was really written by Matthew, we have the narrative of one of the number from which to judge what were the miracles, and the kind of miracles, which the apoſtles attributed to Jeſus. Although, for argument's ſake, and only for argument's ſake, we ſhould allow that this goſpel had been erroneouſly aſcribed to Matthew, yet if the goſpel of St. John be genuine, the obſervation holds with no leſs ſtrength. Again, although the goſpels both of Matthew and John could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be ſpurious, yet, if the goſpel of St.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0270800301:161"/>
Luke was truly the compoſition of that perſon, or of any perſon, be his name what it might, who was actually in the ſituation in which the author of that goſpel profeſſes himſelf to have been; or if the goſpel which bears the name of Mark really proceeded from him; we ſtill, even upon the loweſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, poſſeſs the accounts of one writer at leaſt, who was not only contemporary with the apoſtles, but aſſociated with them in their miniſtry; which authority ſeems ſufficient, when the queſtion is ſimply what it was which theſe apoſtles advanced.</p>
                  <p>I think it material to have this well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed. The New Teſtament contains a great number of diſtinct writings, the genuineneſs of any one of which is almoſt ſufficient to prove the truth of the religion: it contains, however, four diſtinct hiſtories, the genuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any one of which is perfectly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. If, therefore, we muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as encountering the riſk of error in aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authors of our books, we are enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to the advantage of ſo many ſeparate

probabilities. And although it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that ſome of the evangeliſts had ſeen and uſed each other's works, this diſcovery, whilſt it ſubtracts indeed from their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as teſtimonies ſtrictly independent, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, I conceive, little, either their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate authority, by which I mean the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any one that is genuine, or their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual confirmation. For let the moſt diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſuppoſition poſſible be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; let it be allowed, what I ſhould have no great difficulty in admitting, that Mark compiled his hiſtory almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from thoſe of Matthew and Luke; and let it alſo, for a moment, be ſuppoſed, that theſe hiſtories were not, in fact, written by Matthew and Luke; yet if it be true that Mark, a contemporary of the apoſtles, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in habits of ſociety with the apoſtles, a fellow-traveller and fellow-labourer with ſome of them; if, I ſay, it be true that this perſon made the compilation, it follows, that the writings from which he made it exiſted in the ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es of the apoſtles, and not only ſo, but that they were then in ſuch eſteem and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0270800301:165"/>
credit that a companion of the apoſtles form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a hiſtory out of them. Let the goſpel of Mark be called an epitome of that of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew; if a perſon, in the ſituation in which Mark is deſcribed to have been, actually made the epitome, it affords the ſtrongeſt poſſible atteſtation to the character of the original.</p>
                  <p>Again, paralleliſms in ſentences, in words, and in the order of words, have been traced out between the goſpel of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew and that of Luke; which concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence cannot eaſily be explained otherwiſe than by ſuppoſing, either that Luke had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted Matthew's hiſtory, or, what appears to me in no wiſe incredible, that minutes of ſome of Chriſt's diſcourſes, as well as brief memoirs of ſome paſſages of his life, had been committed to writing at the time, and that ſuch written accounts had by both authors been occaſionally admitted into their hiſtories. Either ſuppoſition is perfectly conſiſtent with the acknowledged formation of St. Luke's narrative, who profeſſes not to write as an eye-witneſs, but to have inveſtigated
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0270800301:166"/>
the original of every account which he delivers; in other words, to have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected them from ſuch documents and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monics, as he, who had the beſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of making enquiries, judged to be authentic. Therefore, allowing that this writer alſo, in ſome inſtances, borrowed from the goſpel which we call Matthew's, and once more allowing, for the ſake of ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the argument, that that goſpel was not the production of the author to whom we aſcribe it, yet ſtill we have, in St. Luke's goſpel, a hiſtory given by a writer immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately connected with the tranſaction, with the witneſſes of it, with the perſons engaged in it, and compoſed from materials which that perſon, thus ſituated, deemed to be ſafe ſources of intelligence: in other words, whatever ſuppoſition be made concerning any or all the other goſpels, if St. Luke's goſpel be genuine, we have <hi>in it</hi> a credible evidence of the point which we maintain.</p>
                  <p>The goſpel according to St. John appears to be, and is on all hands allowed to be, an
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0270800301:167"/>
independent teſtimony, ſtrictly and properly ſo called. Notwithſtanding, therefore, any connection, or ſuppoſed connection, between ſome of the goſpels, I again repeat, what I before ſaid, that, if any one of the four be genuine, we have in that one, ſtrong reaſon from the character and ſituation of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to believe, that we poſſeſs the accounts which the original emiſſaries of the religion delivered.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In treating of the written evidences of Chriſtianity, next to their ſeparate, we are to conſider their aggregate authority. Now there is in the evangelic hiſtory a cumulation of teſtimony which belongs hardly to any other hiſtory, but which our habitual mode of reading the ſcriptures ſometimes cauſes us to overlook. When a paſſage, in any wiſe relating to the hiſtory of Chriſt, is read to us out of the epiſtle of Clemens Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, the epiſtles of Ignatius, of Polycarp, or from any other writing of that age, we are immediately ſenſible of the conſirmation which it affords to the ſcripture account.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0270800301:168"/>
Here is a new witneſs. Now if we had been accuſtomed to read the goſpel of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew alone, and had known that of Luke only as the generality of Chriſtians know the writings of the apoſtolical fathers, that is, had known that ſuch a writing was extant and acknowledged; when we came, for the firſt time, to look into what it contained, and found many of the facts which Matthew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, recorded alſo there, many other facts of a ſimilar nature added, and throughout the whole work the ſame general ſeries of tranſactions ſtated, and the ſame general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the perſon who was the ſubject of the hiſtory preſerved, I apprehend that we ſhould ſeel our minds ſtrongly impreſſed by this diſcovery of freſh evidence. We ſhould feel a renewal of the ſame ſentiment in firſt reading the goſpel of St. John. That of St. Mark perhaps would ſtrike us as an abridgement of the hiſtory with which we were already acquainted; but we ſhould na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reflect, that, if that hiſtory was abridged by ſuch a perſon as Mark, or by any perſon of ſo early an age, it afforded one
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0270800301:169"/>
of the higheſt poſſible atteſtations to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the work. This ſucceſſive diſcloſure of proof would leave us aſſured, that there muſt have been at leaſt ſome reality in a ſtory which, not one, but many, had taken in hand to commit to writing. The very exiſtence of four ſeparate hiſtories would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy us that the ſubject had a foundation; and when, amidſt the variety which the different information of the different writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had ſupplied to their accounts, or which their different choice and judgement in ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their materials had produced, we obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many facts to ſtand the ſame in all; of theſe facts, at leaſt, we ſhould conclude, that they were fixed in their credit and publicity. If, after this, we ſhould come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a diſtinct hiſtory, and that alſo of the ſame age with the reſt, taking up the ſubject where the others had left it, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a narrative of the effects produced in the world by the extraordinary cauſes of which we had already been informed, and which effects ſubſiſt at this day, we ſhould think the reality of the original ſtory in no
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0270800301:170"/>
little degree eſtabliſhed by this ſupplement. If ſubſequent enquiries ſhould bring to our knowledge, one after another, letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſome of the principal agents in the buſineſs, upon the buſineſs, and during the time of their activity and concern in it, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming all along and recognizing the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtory, agitating the queſtions that aroſe out of it, preſſing the obligations which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from it, giving advice and directions to thoſe who acted upon it, I conceive that we ſhould find, in every one of theſe, a ſtill further ſupport to the concluſion we had formed. At preſent the weight of this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive confirmation is, in a great meaſure, unperceived by us. The evidence does not appear to us what it is; for, being from our infancy accuſtomed to regard the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament as one book, we ſee in it only one teſtimony. The whole occurs to us as a ſingle evidence; and its different parts, not as diſtinct atteſtations, but as different por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only of the ſame. Yet in this concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubject we are certainly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; for the very diſcrepancies amongſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0270800301:171"/>
the ſeveral documents which form our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, prove, if all other proof was wanting, that in their original compoſition they were ſeparate, and moſt of them independent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</p>
                  <p>If we diſpoſe our ideas in a different or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the matter ſtands thus:—Whilſt the tranſaction was recent, and the original wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were at hand to relate it; and whilſt the apoſtles were buſied in preaching and travelling, in collecting diſciples, in forming and regulating ſocieties of converts, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting themſelves againſt oppoſition; whilſt they exerciſed their miniſtry under the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſings of frequent perſecution, and in a ſtate of almoſt continual alarm, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that, in this engaged, anxicus, and unſettled condition of life, they would think immediately of writing hiſtories for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the public or of poſterity <note n="*" place="bottom">This thought occurred to Euſebius—"Nor were the apoſtles of Chriſt greatly concerned about the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of books, being engaged in a more excellent miniſtry, which is above all human power."

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0270800301:172"/>
But it is very probable, that emergencies might draw from ſome of them, occaſional letters upon the ſubject of their miſſion, to converts, or to ſocieties of converts, with which they were connected; or that they might addreſs written diſcourſes and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to the diſciples of the inſtitution at large, which would be received and read with a reſpect proportioned to the character of the writer. Accounts in the mean time would get abroad, of the extraordinary things that had been paſſing, written with different degrees of information and correctneſs. The extenſion of the Chriſtian ſociety, which could no longer be inſtructed by a perſonal intercourſe with the apoſtles, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible circulation of imperfect or erroneous narratives, would ſoon teach ſome amongſt them the expediency of ſending forth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic memoirs of the life and doctrine of their maſter. When accounts appeared, authorized
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0270800301:173"/>
by the name, and credit, and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the writers, recommended or recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by the apoſtles and firſt preachers of the religion, or found to coincide with what the apoſtles and firſt preachers of the religion had taught, other accounts would fall into diſuſe and neglect; whilſt theſe, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their reputation (as, if genuine and well founded, they would do) under the teſt of time, enquiry, and contradiction, might be expected to make their way into the hands of Chriſtians of all countries of the world.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems the natural progreſs of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; and with this the records in our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and the evidence concerning them, correſpond. We have remaining, in the firſt place, many letters of the kind above deſcribed, which have been preſerved with a care and fidelity anſwering to the reſpect with which we may ſuppoſe that ſuch letters would be received. But as theſe letters were not written to prove the truth of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, in the ſenſe in which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that queſtion; nor to convey information
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0270800301:174"/>
of facts, of which thoſe to whom the letters were written had been previouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; we are not to look in them for any thing more than incidental alluſions to the Chriſtian hiſtory. We are able, however, to gather from theſe documents various particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar atteſtations which have been already enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated; and this is a ſpecies of written evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as far as it goes, in the higheſt degree ſatisfactory, and in point of time perhaps the firſt. But for our more circumſtantial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation we have, in the next place, five direct <hi>biſtories,</hi> bearing the names of perſons acquainted, by their ſituation, with the truth of what they relate, and three of them pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, in the very body of the narrative, to be written by ſuch perſons: of which books we know that ſome were in the hands of thoſe who were contemporaries of the apoſtles, and that, in the age immediately poſterior to that, they were in the hands, we may ſay, of every one, and received by Chriſtians with ſo much reſpect and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as to be conſtantly quoted and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to by them without any doubt of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0270800301:175"/>
truth of their accounts. They were treated as ſuch hiſtories, proceeding from ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, might expect to be treated. In the preface to one of our hiſtories we have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations left us of the exiſtence of ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient accounts which are now loſt. There is nothing in this circumſtance that can ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe us. It was to be expected from the magnitude and novelty of the occaſion that ſuch accounts would <hi>ſwarm.</hi> When better accounts came forth, theſe died away. Our preſent hiſtories ſuperſeded others. They ſoon acquired a character and eſtabliſhed a reputation which does not appear to have belonged to any other: that, at leaſt, can be proved concerning them, which cannot be proved concerning any other.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the point which led to theſe reflections. By conſidering our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in either of the two views in which we have repreſented them, we ſhall perceive that we poſſeſs a <hi>collection of proofs,</hi> and not a naked or ſolitary teſtimony; and that the written evidence is of ſuch a kind, and comes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0270800301:176"/>
to us in ſuch a ſtate, as the natural order and progreſs of things, in the infancy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, might be expected to produce.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; The genuineneſs of the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal books of the New Teſtament is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly a point of importance, becauſe the ſtrength of their evidence is augmented by our knowledge of the ſituation of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, their relation to the ſubject, and the part which they ſuſtained in the tranſaction; and the teſtimonies which we are able to produce, compoſe a ſirm ground of perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the goſpels were written by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe names they bear. Nevertheleſs, I muſt be allowed to ſtate, that, to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I am endeavouring to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, this point is not eſſential; I mean, ſo eſſential as that the fate of the argument de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it. The queſtion before us is, whether the goſpels exhibit the ſtory which the apoſtles and firſt emiſſaries of the religion publiſhed, and <hi>for</hi> which they acted and ſuffered, in the manner in which, for ſome miraculous ſtory or other, they did act and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0270800301:177"/>
ſuffer. Now let us ſuppoſe that we poſſeſſed no other information concerning theſe books than that they were written by early diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſtianity; that they were known and read during the time, or near the time, of the original apoſtles of the religion; that by Chriſtians whom the apoſtles inſtructed, by ſocieties of Chriſtians which the apoſtles ſounded, theſe books were <hi>received</hi> (by which term "received" I mean that they were believed to contain authentic accounts of the tranſaction upon which the religion reſted, and accounts which were accordingly uſed, repeated, and relied upon), this recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be a valid proof that theſe books, whoever were the authors of them, muſt have accorded with what the apoſtles taught. A reception by the firſt race of Chriſtians is evidence that they agreed with what the firſt teachers of the religion delivered. In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, if they had not agreed with what the apoſtles themſelves preached, how could they have gained credit in churches and ſocieties which the apoſtles eſtabliſhed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0270800301:178"/>
Now the fact of their early exiſtence, and not only of their exiſtence but their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is made out by ſome ancient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which do not happen to ſpecify the names of the writers: add to which, what hath been already hinted, that two out of the four goſpels contain averments in the body of the hiſtory, which, though they do not diſcloſe the names, fix the time and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the authors, viz. that one was written by an eye-witneſs of the ſufferings of Chriſt, the other by a contemporary of the apoſtles. In the goſpel of St. John, (xix. 35.) after deſcribing the crucifixion, with the particular circumſtance of piercing Chriſt's ſide with a ſpear, the hiſtorian adds, as for himſelf, "and he that ſaw it bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and his record is true, and he knoweth that he faith true. that ye might believe." Again, (xxi. 24.) after relating a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which paſſed between Peter and the diſciple, as it is there expreſſed, whom Jeſus loved, it is added, "this is the diſciple which teſtiſieth of theſe things and wrote theſe things." This teſtimony, let it be remarked,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0270800301:179"/>
is not the leſs worthy of regard, becauſe it is in one view imperfect. The name is not mentioned; which, if a fraudulent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had been intended, would have been done. The third of our preſent goſpels purports to have been written by the perſon who wrote the Acts of the Apoſtles; in which latter hiſtory, or rather latter part of the ſame hiſtory, the author, by uſing in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places the firſt perſon plural, declares himſelf to have been a contemporary of all, and a companion of one of the original preachers of the religion.</p>

ſtate the proper and diſtinct proofs, which ſhow not only the general value of theſe records, but their ſpecific authority, and the high probability there is that they actually came from the perſons whoſe names they bear.</p>
                  <p>There are, however, a few preliminary reflections, by which we may draw up with more regularity to the propoſitions, upon which the cloſe and particular diſcuſſion of the ſubject depends. Of which nature are the following:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. We are able to produce a great number of ancient <hi>manuſcripts,</hi> found in many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries, and in countries widely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from each other, all of them anterior to the art of printing, ſome certainly ſeven or eight hundred years old, and ſome which have been preſerved probably above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years <note n="*" place="bottom">The Alexandrian manuſcript, now in the British Muſeum, was written probably in the fourth or fifth century.</note>. We have alſo many ancient
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0270800301:182"/>
                     <hi>verſions</hi> of theſe books, and ſome of them into languages which are not at preſent, nor for many ages have been, ſpoken in any part of the world. The exiſtence of theſe manuſcripts and verſions proves that the ſcriptures were not the production of any modern contrivance. It does away alſo the uncertainty which hangs over ſuch publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the works, real or pretended, of Oſſian and Rowley, in which the editors are challenged to produce their manuſcripts, and to ſhow where they obtained their copies. The number of manuſcripts, far exceeding thoſe of any other book, and their wide dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion, affords an argument, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to the ſenſes, that the ſcriptures, anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, in like manner as at this day, were more read and ſought after than any other books, and that alſo in many different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The greateſt part of ſpurious Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian writings are utterly loſt, the reſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome ſingle manuſcript. There is weight alſo in Dr. Bentley's obſervation, that the New Teſtament has ſuffered leſs injury by the errors of tranſcribers than the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0270800301:183"/>
works of any profane author of the ſame ſize and antiquity; that is, there never was any writing in the preſervation and purity of which the world was ſo intereſted or ſo careful.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. An argument of great weight with thoſe who are judges of the proofs upon which it is founded, and capable, through their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of being addreſſed to every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is that which ariſes from the ſtyle and language of the New Teſtament. It is juſt ſuch a language as might be expected from the apoſtles, from perſons of their age and in their ſituation, and from no other perſons. It is the ſtyle neither of claſſic authors, nor of the ancient Chriſtian fathers, but Greek coming from men of Hebrew origin; abounding, that is, with Hebraic and Syriac idioms, ſuch as would naturally be found in the writings of men who uſed a language ſpoken indeed where they lived, but not the common dialect of the country. This happy peculiarity is a ſtrong proof of the genuineneſs of theſe writings; for who
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0270800301:184"/>
ſhould forge them? The Chriſtian fathers were for the moſt part totally ignorant of Hebrew, and therefore were not likely to inſert Hebraiſms and Syriaſms into their writings. The few who had a knowledge of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, as Juſtin Martyr, Origen, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, wrote in a language which bears no reſemblance to that of the New Teſtament. The Nazarenes, who underſtood Hebrew, uſed chieſly, perhaps almoſt entirely, the goſpel of St. Matthew, and therefore cannot be ſuſpected of forging the reſt of the ſacred writings. The argument, at any rate, proves the antiquity of theſe books; that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the age of the apoſtles; that they could be compoſed indeed in no other <note n="*" place="bottom">See this argument ſtated more at large in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelis's Introduction (Marſh's tranſlation), vol. I. c. ii. ſec. 10. from which theſe obſervations are taken.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Why ſhould we queſtion the genuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe books? Is it for that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain accounts of ſupernatural events? I apprehend that this, at the bottom, is the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0270800301:185"/>
real, though ſecret, cauſe of our heſitation about them; for had the writings inſcribed with the name of Matthew and John related nothing but ordinary hiſtory, there would have been no more doubt whether theſe writings were theirs, than there is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acknowledged works of Joſephus or Philo, that is, there would have been no doubt at all. Now it ought to be conſidered that this reaſon, however it may apply to the credit which is given to a writer's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or veracity, affects the queſtion of genuineneſs very indirectly. The works of Bede exhibit many wonderful relations; but who for that reaſon doubts that they were written by Bede? The ſame of a multitude of other authors. To which may be added, that we aſk no more for our books than what we allow to other books in ſome ſort ſimilar to ours. We do not deny the genuineneſs of the Koran. We admit that the hiſtory of Appollonius Tyanaeus, purporting to be written by Philoſtratus, was really written by Philoſtratus.</p>

IV. If it had been an eaſy thing in the early times of the inſtitution to have forged Chriſtian writings, and to have obtained cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and reception to the forgeries, we ſhould have had many appearing in the name of Chriſt himſelf. No writings would have been received with ſo much avidity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as theſe; conſequently none afforded ſo great temptation to forgery. Yet have we heard but of one attempt of this ſort deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſmalleſt notice, <hi>that</hi> in a piece of a very few lines, and ſo far from ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I mean, from obtaining acceptance and reputation, or an acceptance and reputation in any wiſe ſimilar to that which can be proved to have attended the books of the New Teſtament, that it is not ſo much as mentioned by any writer of the three firſt centuries. The learned reader need not be informed that I mean the epiſtle of Chriſt to Abgarus, king of Edeſſa, found at preſent in the work of Euſebius <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Eccl. l. i. c. 15.</note>, as a piece ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by him, though not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable doubt whether the whole paſſage
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0270800301:187"/>
be not an interpolation, as it is moſt certain, that, after the publication of Euſebius's work, this epiſtle was univerſally rejected <note n="*" place="bottom">Auguſtin, A. D. 395, (De Confenſ. Evang. c. 34.) had <hi>heard</hi> that the Pagans pretended to be poſſeſſed of an epiſtle from Chriſt to Peter and Paul, but he had never ſeen it, and appears to doubt of the exiſtence of any ſuch piece, either genuine or ſpurious. No other ancient writer mentions it. He alſo, and he alone, notices, and that in order to condemn it, an epiſtle aſcribed to Chriſt by the Manichees, A. D. 270, and a ſhort hymn attributed to him by the Priſcillianiſts, A. D. 378, (cont. Fauſt. Man. lib. xxviii. c. 4.) The late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the writer who notices theſe things, the manner in which he notices them, and above all, the ſilence of every preceding writer, render them unworthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. If the aſcription of the goſpels to their reſpective authors had been arbitrary or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural, they would have been aſcribed to more eminent men. This obſervation holds concerning the three firſt goſpels, the reputed authors of which were enabled, by their ſituation, to obtain true intelligence, and were likely to deliver an honeſt account of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0270800301:188"/>
what they knew; but were perſons not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in the hiſtory by extraordinary marks of notice or commendation. Of the apoſtles, I hardly know any one of whom leſs is ſaid than of Matthew; or of whom the little that is ſaid, is leſs calculated to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his character. Of Mark nothing is ſaid in the Goſpels; and what is ſaid of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that name in the Acts, and in the Epiſtles, in no part beſtows praiſe or emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence upon him. The name of Luke is mentioned only in St. Paul's Epiſtles <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Col. iv. 14.</p>
                        <p>2 Tim. iv. 11.</p>
                        <p>Philem. 24.</p>
                     </note>, and that very tranſiently. The judgement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which aſſigned theſe writings to theſe authors, proceeded, it may be preſumed, upon proper knowledge and evidence, and not upon a voluntary choice of names.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Chriſtian writers and Chriſtian churches appear to have ſoon arrived at a very general agreement upon the ſubject, and that without the interpoſition of any public authority. When the diverſity of opinion, which prevailed and prevails among Chriſtians
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0270800301:189"/>
in other points, is conſidered, their concurrence in the canon of ſcripture is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and of great weight, eſpecially as it ſeems to have been the reſult of private and free enquiry. We have no knowledge of any interference of authority in the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the council of Laodicea in the year 363. Probably the decree of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil rather declared than regulated the public judgement, or, more properly ſpeaking, the judgement of ſome neighbouring churches; the council itſelf conſiſting of no more than thirty or forty biſhops of Lydia and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining countries <note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner's Cred. vol. viii. p. 291 et ſeq.</note>. Nor does its authority ſeem to have extended farther; for we find numerous Chriſtian writers, after this time, diſcuſſing the queſtion, "what books were entitled to be received as ſcripture," with great freedom, upon proper grounds of evidence, and without any reference to the deciſion at Laodicea.</p>

                  <p>THESE conſiderations are not to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected: but of an argument concerning the genuineneſs of ancient writings, the ſubſtance undoubtedly and ſtrength is ancient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                  <p>This teſtimony it is neceſſary to exhibit ſomewhat in detail; for when Chriſtian advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates merely tell us, that we have the ſame reaſon for believing the Goſpels to be written by the evangeliſts, whoſe names they bear, as we have for believing the Commentaries to be Ceſar's, the Aeneid Virgil's, or the Orations Cicero's, they content themſelves with an imperfect repreſentation. They ſtate nothing more than what is true, but they do not ſtate the truth correctly. In the number, variety, and early date of our
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0270800301:191"/>
teſtimonies, we far exceed all other ancient books. For one, which the moſt celebrated work of the moſt celebrated Greek or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man writer can alledge, we produce many. But then it is more requiſite in our books, than in theirs, to ſeparate and diſtinguiſh them from ſpurious competitors. The reſult, I am convinced, will be ſatisfactory to every fair enquirer; but this circumſtance renders an enquiry neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>In a work, however, like the preſent, there is a difficulty in finding a place for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this kind. To purſue the detail of proofs throughout, would be to tranſcribe a great part of Dr. Lardner's eleven octavo volumes; to leave the argument without proofs, is to leave it without effect; for the perſuaſion produced by this ſpecies of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence depends upon a view and induction of the particulars which compoſe it.</p>
                  <p>The method which I propoſe to myſelf is, firſt, to place before the reader, in one view, the propoſitions which compriſe the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0270800301:192"/>
ſeveral heads of our teſtimony, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to repeat the ſame propoſitions in ſo many diſtinct ſections, with the neceſſary authorities ſubjoined to each <note n="*" place="bottom">The reader, when he has the propoſitions before him, will obſerve that the argument, if he ſhould omit the ſections, proceeds connectedly from this point.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The following, then, are the allegations upon the ſubject, which are capable of being eſtabliſhed by proof:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That the hiſtorical books of the New Teſtament, meaning thereby the four Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels and the Acts of the Apoſtles, are quoted, or alluded to, by a ſeries of Chriſtian writers, beginning with thoſe who were contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with the apoſtles, or who immediately followed them, and proceeding in cloſe and regular ſucceſſion from their time to the preſent.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That when they are quoted, or alluded to, they are quoted or alluded to with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reſpect, as books <hi>ſui generis;</hi> as poſſeſſing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0270800301:193"/>
an authority which belonged to no other books, and as concluſive in all queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and controverſies amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That they were, in very early times, collected into a diſtinct volume.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That they were diſtinguiſhed by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate names and titles of reſpect.</p>

                  <p n="6">VI. That commentaries were written upon them, harmonies formed out of them, different copies carefully collated, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of them made into different languages.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. That they were received by Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of different ſects, by many heretics as well as catholics, and uſually appealed to by both ſides in the controverſies which aroſe in thoſe days.</p>

                     <p>THE medium of proof ſtated in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, of all others, the moſt unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, the leaſt liable to any practices of fraud, and is not diminiſhed by the lapſe of ages. Biſhop Burnet, in the Hiſtory of his own Times, inſerts various extracts from Lord Clarendon's Hiſtory. <hi>One</hi> ſuch inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a proof, that Lord Clarendon's Hiſtory was extant at the time when Biſhop Burnet wrote, that it had been read by Biſhop Burnet,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0270800301:196"/>
that it was received by Biſhop Burnet as a work of Lord Clarendon's, and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by him as an authentic account of the tranſactions which it relates: and it will be a proof of theſe points a thouſand years hence, or as long as the books exiſt. Quintilian having quoted as Cicero's <note n="*" place="bottom">Quint. lib. xi. c. 1.</note>, that well-known trait of diſſembled vanity, <q>Si quid eſt in me ingenii, Judices, quod ſentio quàm ſit exiguum—</q> the quotation would be ſtrong evidence, were there any doubt, that the oration, which opens with this addreſs, actually came from Cicero's pen. Theſe inſtances, however ſimple, may ſerve to point out to a reader, who is little accuſtomed to ſuch reſearches, the nature and value of the argument.</p>
                     <p>The teſtimonies which we have to bring forward under this propoſition are the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                     <p n="1">I. There is extant an epiſtle aſcribed to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0270800301:197"/>
Barnabas <note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner's Cred. ed. 1755, vol. i. p. 23 et ſeq. The reader will obſerve from the references, that the materials of theſe ſections are almoſt entirely extracted from Dr. Lardner's work—my office conſiſted in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement and ſelection.</note>, the companion of Paul. It is quoted as the Epiſtle of Barnabas by Clement of Alexandria, A. D. 194; by Origen, A. D. 230. It is mentioned by Euſebius, A. D. 315, and by Jerome, A. D. 392, as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient work in their time, bearing the name of Barnabas, and as well known and read amongſt Chriſtians, though not accounted a part of Scripture. It purports to have been written ſoon after the deſtruction of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, during the calamities which followed that diſaſter; and it bears the character of the age to which it profeſſes to belong.</p>
                     <p>In this epiſtle appears the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage:—"Let us, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt it come upon us, <hi>as it is written,</hi> There are many called, few choſen." From the expreſſion, "as it is written," we infer with certainty, that, at the time when the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0270800301:198"/>
author of this epiſtle lived, there was a book extant, well known to Chriſtians, and of authority amongſt them, containing theſe words—"Many are called, few choſen." Such a book is our preſent Goſpel of St. Matthew, in which this text is twice found <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xx. 16. xxii. 14.</note>, and is found in no other book now known. There is a farther obſervation to be made upon the terms of the quotation. The writer of the epiſtle was a Jew. The phraſe "it is written" was the very form in which the Jews quoted their ſcriptures. It is not probable, therefore, that he would have uſed this phraſe, and without qualification, of any books but what had acquired a kind of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural authority. If the paſſage remarked in this ancient writing had been found in one of St. Paul's epiſtles, it would have been eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed by every one a high teſtimony to St. Matthew's goſpel. It ought, therefore, to be remembered, that the writing in which it <hi>is</hi> found was probably by very few years poſterior to thoſe of St. Paul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0270800301:199"/>
Beſide this paſſage, there are alſo in the epiſtle before us ſeveral others, in which the ſentiment is the ſame with what we meet with in St. Matthew's goſpel, and two or three in which we recognize the ſame words. In particular, the author of the epiſtle repeats the precept, "Give to every one that aſketh thee <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. v. 42.</note>," and faith that Chriſt choſe as his apoſtles, who were to preach the goſpel, men who were great ſinners, that he might ſhew that he came "not to call the righteous, but ſinners, to repentance <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. ix. 13.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="2">II. We are in poſſeſſion of an epiſtle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Clement, Biſhop of Rome <note n="‡" place="bottom">Lardner's Cred. vol. i. p. 62 et ſeq.</note>, whom ancient writers, without any doubt or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, aſſert to have been the Clement whom St. Paul mentions, Phil. iv. 3. "with <hi>Clement</hi> alſo, and other my fellow labourers, whoſe names are in the book of life." This epiſtle is ſpoken of by the ancients as an epiſtle acknowledged by all; and, as Irenaeus
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0270800301:200"/>
well repreſents its value, "written by Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who had ſeen the bleſſed apoſtles and converſed with them, who had the preaching of the apoſtles ſtill ſounding in his ears, and their traditions before his eyes." It is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the church of Corinth; and what alone may ſeem almoſt deciſive of its authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity, Dionyſius, Biſhop of Corinth, about the year 170, <hi>i. e.</hi> about eighty or ninety years after the epiſtle was written, bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, "that it had been wont to be read in that church from ancient times."</p>
                     <p>This epiſtle affords, amongſt others, the following valuable paſſages:—"Eſpecially remembering the words of the Lord Jeſus which he ſpake, teaching gentleneſs and long ſuffering; for thus he ſaid <note n="*" place="bottom">"Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy." Mat. v. 7.—"Forgive, and ye ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; give, and it ſhall be given unto you." Luke vi. 37, 38.—"Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgement ye judge, ye ſhall be judged, and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again." Mat. vii. 2.</note>: Be ye
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0270800301:201"/>
merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven unto you; as you do, ſo ſhall it be done unto you; as you give, ſo ſhall it be given unto you; as ye judge, ſo ſhall ye be judged; as ye ſhew kindneſs, ſo ſhall kindneſs be ſhewn unto you; with what meaſure ye mete, with the ſame it ſhall be meaſured to you. By this command, and by theſe rules, let us eſtabliſh ourſelves, that we may always walk obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to his holy words."</p>
                     <p>Again, "Remember the words of the Lord Jeſus, for he ſaid, Wo to that man by whom offences come; it were better for him that he had not been born, than that he ſhould offend one of my elect; it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him that a mill-ſtone ſhould be tied about his neck, and that he ſhould be drowned in the ſea, than that he ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend one of my little ones <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xviii. 6. "But whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a mill-ſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were caſt into the ſea." The latter part of the paſſage in Clement agrees more exactly with Luke xvii. 2. "It were better for him that a mill-ſtone were hanged about his neck, and he caſt into the ſea, than that he ſhould offend one of theſe little ones."</note>."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0270800301:202"/>
In both theſe paſſages we perceive the high reſpect paid to the words of Chriſt as recorded by the evangeliſts: <hi>"Remember</hi> the words of the Lord Jeſus—by this command and by theſe rules let us eſtabliſh ourſelves, that we may always walk obediently to his holy words." We perceive alſo in Clement a total unconſciouſneſs of doubt, whether theſe were the real words of Chriſt, which are read as ſuch in the goſpels. This obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation indeed belongs to the whole ſeries of teſtimony, and eſpecially to the moſt ancient part of it. Whenever any thing now read in the goſpels is met with in an early Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian writing, it is always obſerved to ſtand there as acknowledged truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced without heſitation, doubt, or apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. It is to be obſerved alſo, that as this epiſtle was written in the name of the church of Rome, and addreſſed to the church of Corinth, it ought to be taken as exhibiting
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0270800301:203"/>
the judgement not only of Clement, who drew up the letter, but of theſe churches themſelves, at leaſt as to the authority of the books referred to.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid, that, as Clement hath not uſed words of quotation, it is not certain that he refers to any book whatever. The words of Chriſt, which he has put down, he might himſelf have heard from the apoſtles, or might have received through the ordinary medium of oral tradition. This hath been ſaid; but that no ſuch inference can be drawn from the abſence of words of quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is proved by the three following conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations:—Firſt, that Clement, in the very ſame manner, namely, without any mark of reference, uſes a paſſage now found in the epiſtle to the Romans <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. i. 29.</note>; which paſſage, from the peculiarity of the words which compoſe it, and from their order, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that he muſt have taken from the book. The ſame remark may be repeated of ſome
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0270800301:204"/>
ſingular ſentiments in the epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews. Secondly, that there are many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of St. Paul's firſt epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians ſtanding in Clement's epiſtle without any ſign of quotation, which yet certainly are quotations; becauſe it appears that Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had St. Paul's epiſtle before him, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in one place he mentions it in terms too expreſs to leave us in any doubt—"Take into your hands the epiſtle of the bleſſed apoſtle Paul." Thirdly, that this method of adopting words of ſcripture, without refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or acknowledgement, was, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the ſequel, a method in general uſe amongſt the moſt ancient Chriſtian writers. Theſe analogies not only repel the objection, but caſt the preſumption on the other ſide; and afford a conſiderable degree of poſitive proof, that the words in queſtion have been borrowed from the places of ſcripture in which we now find them.</p>
                     <p>But take it if you will the other way, that Clement had heard theſe words from the apoſtles or firſt teachers of Chriſtianity; with
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0270800301:205"/>
reſpect to the preciſe point of our argument, viz. that the ſcriptures contain what the apoſtles taught, this ſuppoſition may ſerve almoſt as well.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Near the concluſion of the epiſtle to the Romans, St. Paul, amongſt others, ſends the following ſalutation: "Salute Aſyncri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Phlegon, <hi>Hermas,</hi> Patrobus, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them."</p>
                     <p>Of Hermas, who appears in this cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Roman Chriſtians as contemporary with St. Paul, a book bearing the name, and it is moſt probable rightly, is ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is called the Shepherd or Paſtor of Hermas <note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner's Cred. vol. i. p. 111.</note>. Its antiquity is inconteſtable, from the quotations of it in Irenaeus, A. D. 178, Clement of Alexandria, A. D. 194, Tertullian, A. D. 200, Origen, A. D. 230. The notes of time extant in the epiſtle itſelf agree with its title, and with the teſtimonies concerning it, for it purports to have been written during the lifetime of Clement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0270800301:206"/>
In this piece are tacit alluſions to St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew's, St. Luke's, and St. John's goſpels, that is to ſay, there are applications of thoughts and expreſſions found in theſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, without citing the place or writer from which they were taken. In this form appear in Hermas the confeſſing and denying of Chriſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. x. 32, 33. or Luke xii. 8, 9.</note>; the parable of the ſeed ſown <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xiii. 3 or Luke viii. 5.</note>; the compariſon of Chriſt's diſciples to little children; the ſaying, "he that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery <note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xvi. 18.</note>." The ſingular expreſſion, "hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received all power from his father," in probable alluſion to Mat. xxviii. 18. and Chriſt being the "gate," or only way of coming "to God," in plain alluſion to John xiv. 6.—x. 7. 9. There is alſo a probable alluſion to Acts v. 32.</p>
                     <p>This piece is the repreſentation of a viſion, and has by many been accounted a weak and fanciful performance. I therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the character of the writing has
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0270800301:207"/>
little to do with the purpoſe for which we adduce it. It is the age in which it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that gives the value to its teſtimony.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Ignatius, as it is teſtified by ancient Chriſtian writers, became Biſhop of Antioch about thirty-ſeven years after Chriſt's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion; and therefore, from his time, and place, and ſtation, it is probable that he had known and converſed with many of the apoſtles. Epiſtles of Ignatius are referred to by Polycarp his contemporary. Paſſages, found in the epiſtles now extant under his name, are quoted by Irenaeus, A. D. 178, by Origen, A. D. 230; and the occaſion of writing the epiſtles is given at large by Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius and Jerome. What are called the ſmaller epiſtles of Ignatius are generally deemed to be thoſe which were read by Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Origen, and Euſebius <note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner's Cred. vol. i. p. 147.</note>.</p>
                     <p>In theſe epiſtles are various undoubted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions to the goſpels of St. Matthew and St. John; yet ſo far of the ſame form with thoſe in the preceding articles, that, like
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0270800301:208"/>
them, they are not accompanied with marks of quotation.</p>

As to the manner of quotation this is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable:—Ignatius, in one place, ſpeaks of St. Paul in terms of high reſpect, and quotes his epiſtle to the Epheſians by <hi>name;</hi> yet in ſeveral other places he borrows words and ſentiments from the ſame epiſtle without mentioning it: which ſhews, that this was his general manner of uſing and applying writings then extant, and then of high au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Polycarp <note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner's Cred. vol. i. p. 192.</note> had been taught by the apoſtles; had converſed with many who had ſeen Chriſt; was alſo by the apoſtles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Biſhop of Smyrna. This teſtimony concerning Polycarp is given by Irenaeus, who in his youth had ſeen him. "I can tell the place," ſaith Irenaeus, "in which the bleſſed Polycarp ſat and taught, and his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and coming in, and the manner of his life, and the form of his perſon, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0270800301:210"/>
the diſcourſes he made to the people, and how he related his converſation with John and others who had ſeen the Lord, and how he related their ſayings, and what he had heard concerning the Lord, both concerning his miracles and his doctrine, as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from the eye-witneſſes of the word of life: all which Polycarp related agreeable to the ſcriptures."</p>
                     <p>Of Polycarp, whoſe proximity to the age and country and perſons of the apoſtles is thus atteſted, we have one undoubted epiſtle remaining. And this, though a ſhort let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, contains nearly forty clear alluſions to books of the New Teſtament; which is ſtrong evidence of the reſpect which Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of that age bore for theſe books.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt theſe, although the writings of St. Paul are more frequently uſed by Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp than other parts of ſcripture, there are copious alluſions to the goſpel of St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, ſome to paſſages found in the goſpels both of Matthew and Luke, and ſome which more nearly reſemble the words in Luke.</p>

Papias does not ſay, that one goſpel was written by Matthew, and another by Mark, but, aſſuming this as perfectly well known, he tells us from what materials Mark collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his account, viz. from Peter's preaching, and in what language Matthew wrote, viz. in Hebrew.

His remaining works are much larger than any that have yet been noticed. Although the nature of his two principal writings, one of which was addreſſed to heathens, and the other was a conference with a Jew, did not lead him to ſuch frequent appeals to Chriſtian books, as would have appeared in a diſcourſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Chriſtian readers; we neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs reckon up in them between twenty and thirty quotations of the Goſpels and Acts of the Apoſtles, certain, diſtinct, and copious: if each verſe be counted ſeparately, a much

                     <p>We meet with quotations of three of the goſpels within the compaſs of half a page; "and in other words he ſays, Depart from me into outer darkneſs, which the Father hath prepared for Satan and his angels," (which is from Matthew xxv. 41.) "And again he ſaid in other words, I give unto you power to tread upon ſerpents and ſcorpions, and venomous beaſts, and upon all the power of the enemy." (This from Luke x. 19.) "And, before he was crucified, he ſaid, The ſon of man muſt ſuffer many things, and be rejected of the Scribes and Phariſees, and be crucified, and riſe again the third day." (This from Mark viii. 31).</p>
                     <p>In another place Juſtin quotes a paſſage in the hiſtory of Chriſt's birth, as delivered
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0270800301:216"/>
by Matthew and John, and fortiſies his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by this remarkable teſtimony; "as they have taught, who have writ the hiſtory of all things concerning our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and we believe them."</p>
                     <p>Quotations alſo are found from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of St. John.</p>
                     <p>What, moreover, ſeems extremely mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to be obſerved, is, that in all Juſtin's works, from which might be extracted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a complete life of Chriſt, there are but two inſtances, in which he refers to any thing as ſaid or done by Chriſt, which is not related concerning him in our preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels: which ſhews, that theſe goſpels, and theſe, we may ſay, alone, were the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from which the Chriſtians of that day drew the information upon which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. One of theſe inſtances is of a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt not met with in any book now extant <note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>"Wherefore alſo our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, In whatſoever I ſhall find you, in the ſame I will alſo judge you." Poſſibly Juſtin deſigned not to quote any text, but to repreſent the ſenſe of many of our Lord's ſayings. Fabricius has obſerved, that this ſaying has been quoted by many writers, and that Juſtin is the only one who aſcribes it to our Lord, and that perhaps by a ſlip of his memory.</p>
                           <p>Words reſembling theſe are read repeatedly in Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel; "I will judge them according to their ways." (vii. 3. xxxiii. 20). It is remarkable that Juſtin had but juſt before expreſsly quoted Ezekiel. Mr. Jones upon this circumſtance founded a conjecture, that Juſtin wrote only "the Lord hath ſaid," intending to quote the words of God, or rather the ſenſe of thoſe words, in Ezekiel; and that ſome tranſcriber, imagining theſe to be the words of Chriſt, inſerted in his copy the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion "Jeſus Chriſt." Vol. i. p. 539.</p>

Chriſt's baptiſm, namely, a ſiery or luminous appearance upon the water, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Epiphanius, is noticed in the Goſpel of the Hebrews: and which might be true; but which, whether true or falſe, is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Juſtin, with a plain mark of diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when compared with what he quotes as reſting upon ſcripture authority. The reader will advert to this diſtinction; "and then, when Jeſus came to the river Jordan,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0270800301:218"/>
where John was baptizing, as Jeſus deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the water, a fire alſo was kindled in Jordan; and when he came up out of the water, <hi>the apoſtles of this our Chriſt have written,</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt lighted upon him as a dove."</p>
                     <p>All the references in Juſtin are made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning the author; which proves that theſe books were perfectly notorious, and that there were no other accounts of Chriſt then extant, or, at leaſt, no others ſo receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and credited, as to make it neceſſary to diſtinguiſh theſe from the reſt.</p>
                     <p>But although Juſtin mentions not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors' names, he calls the books, "Memoirs compoſed by the Apoſtles," "Memoirs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Apoſtles and their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;" which deſcriptions, the latter eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, exactly ſuit with the titles which the Goſpels and Acts of the Apoſtles now bear.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0270800301:219"/>
years after Juſtin. His teſtimony is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only for this particular; that he relates of himſelf, that, travelling from Paleſtine to Rome, he viſited upon his journey many biſhops; and that "in every ſucceſſion, and in every city, the ſame doctrine is taught, which the Law, and the Prophets, and the <hi>Lord</hi> teacheth." This is an important at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, from good authority, and of high antiquity. It is generally underſtood that by the word "Lord," Hegeſippus intended ſome writing or writings, containing the teaching of Chriſt, in which ſenſe alone, the term combines with the other terms "Law and Prophets," which denote writings; and together with them admits of the verb "preacheth," in the preſent tenſe. Then, that theſe writings were ſome or all of the books of the New Teſtament, is rendered probable from hence, that, in the fragments of his works, which are preſerved in Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, and in a writer of the ninth century, enough, though it be little, is left to ſhew, that Hegeſippus expreſſed divers things in the ſtyle of the Goſpels, and of the Acts of

X. The evidence now opens upon us full and clear. Irenaeus <note n="*" place="bottom">Lard. vol. i. p. 344.</note> ſucceeded Pothinus as biſhop of Lyons. In his youth he had been a diſciple of Polycarp, who was a diſciple of John. In the time in which he lived, he was diſtant not much more than a century from the publication of the Goſpels; in his inſtruction, only by one ſtep ſeparated from the perſons of the Apoſtles. He aſſerts of himſelf and his contemporaries, that they were able to reckon up, in all the principal churches, the ſucceſſion of biſhops from the firſt <note n="†" place="bottom">Adv. Haereſ. l. iii. c. 3.</note>. I remark theſe particulars concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Irenaeus with more formality than uſual; becauſe the teſtimony which this writer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to the hiſtorical books of the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, to their authority, and to the titles which they bear, is expreſs, poſitive, and excluſive. One principal paſſage, in which this teſtimony is contained, opens with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe aſſertion of the point which we have laid down as the foundation of our argument, viz. that the ſtory which the Goſpels exhibit is the ſtory which the Apoſtles told. "We have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0270800301:222"/>
not received," faith Irenaeus, "the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the way of our ſalvation by any others than thoſe by whom the goſpel has been brought to us. Which goſpel they firſt preached, and afterwards, by the will of God, committed to writing, that it might be for time to come the foundation and pillar of our faith.—For after that our Lord roſe from the dead, and they (the apoſtles) were endowed from above with the power of the Holy Ghoſt coming down upon them, they received a perfect knowledge of all things. They then went forth to all the ends of the earth, declaring to men the bleſſing of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peace, having all of them, and every one alike, the goſpel of God. Matthew then, among the Jews, writ a goſpel in their own language, while Peter and Paul were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel at Rome, and founding a church there. And after their exit, Mark alſo, the diſciple and interpreter of Peter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us in writing the things that had been preached by Peter. And Luke, the companion of Paul, put down in a book the goſpel preached by him (Paul). Afterwards
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0270800301:223"/>
John, the diſciple of the Lord, who alſo lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his breaſt, he likewiſe publiſhed a goſpel while he dwelt at Epheſus in Aſia." If any modern divine ſhould write a book upon the genuineneſs of the goſpels, he could not aſſert it more expreſsly, or ſtate their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal more diſtinctly, than Irenaeus hath done within little more than a hundred years after they were publiſhed.</p>
                     <p>The correſpondency, in the days of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, of the oral and written tradition, and the deduction of the oral tradition through various channels from the age of the apoſtles, which was then lately paſſed, and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, the probability that the books truly delivered what the apoſtles taught, is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alſo with ſtrict regularity from another paſſage of his works. "The tradition of the apoſtles (this Father ſaith) hath ſpread itſelf over the whole univerſe; and all they, who ſearch after the ſources of truth, will find this tradition to be held ſacred in every church. We might enumerate all thoſe who have been appointed biſhops to theſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0270800301:224"/>
churches by the apoſtles, and all their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, up to our days. It is by this unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſſion that we have received the tradition which actually exiſts in the church, as alſo the doctrines of truth, as it was preached by the apoſtles <note n="*" place="bottom">Ir. in Haer. I. iii. c. 3.</note>." The reader will obſerve upon this, that the ſame Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, who is now ſtating the ſtrength and uniformity of the tradition, we have before ſeen, recognizing, in the fulleſt manner, the authority of the written records; from which we are entitled to conclude, that they were then conformable to each other.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid, that the teſtimony of Irenaeus in favour of our goſpels is <hi>excluſive</hi> of all others. I allude to a remarkable paſſage in his works, in which, for ſome reaſons ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently fanciful, he endeavours to ſhow, that there could be neither more nor fewer goſpels than <hi>four.</hi> With his argument we have no concern. The poſition itſelf proves that four, and only four, goſpels were at that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0270800301:225"/>
time publicly read and acknowledged. That theſe were our goſpels, and in the ſtate in which we now have them, is ſhown from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places of this writer beſide that which we have already alledged. He mentions how Matthew begins his goſpel, how Mark begins and ends his, and their ſuppoſed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſo doing. He enumerates at length the ſeveral paſſages of Chriſt's hiſtory in Luke, which are not found in any of the other evangeliſts. He ſtates the particular deſign with which St. John compoſed his goſpel, and accounts for the doctrinal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations which precede the narrative.</p>
                     <p>To the book of the Acts of the Apoſtles, its author and credit, the teſtimony of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus is no leſs explicit. Referring to the account of St. Paul's converſion and voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ninth chapter of that book, "Nor can they (ſays he, meaning the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with whom he argues) ſhow that he is not to be credited, who has related to us the truth with the greateſt exactneſs." In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, he has accurately collected the ſeveral
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0270800301:226"/>
texts, in which the writer of the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is repreſented as accompanying St. Paul, which leads him to deliver a ſummary of almoſt the whole of the laſt twelve chapters of the book.</p>
                     <p>In an author, thus abounding with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and alluſions to the ſcriptures, there is not one to any apocryphal Chriſtian writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatever. This is a broad line of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between our ſacred books, and the pretenſions of all others.</p>
                     <p>The force of the teſtimony of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod which we have conſidered, is greatly ſtrengthened by the obſervation, that it is the teſtimony, and the concurring teſtimony, of writers who lived in countries remote from one another.

works of the former of whom are clear references to Mark and Luke; and in the works of the latter, who was biſhop of Antioch, the ſixth in ſucceſſion from the apoſtles, evident alluſions to Matthew and John, and probable alluſions to Luke (which, conſidering the nature of the compoſitions, that they were addreſſed to heathen readers, is as much as could be expected); obſerving alſo, that the works of two learned Chriſtian writers of the ſame age, Miltiades and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taenus <note n="*" place="bottom">Lard. vol. i. p. 418. 450.</note>, are now loſt; of which Miltiades Euſebius records, that his writings "were monuments of zeal for the divine oracles;" and which Pantaenus, as Jerome teſtifies, was a man of prudence and learning, both in the divine ſcriptures and ſecular literature, and had left many commentaries upon the holy ſcriptures then extant: paſſing by theſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further remark, we come to one of the moſt voluminous of ancient Chriſtian writers, Clement of Alexandria <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. vol. ii. p. 469.</note>. Clement follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Irenaeus at the diſtance of only ſixteen
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0270800301:228"/>
years, and therefore may be ſaid to maintain the ſeries of teſtimony in an uninterrupted continuation.</p>
                     <p>In certain of Clement's works, now loſt, but of which various parts are recited by Euſebius, there is given a diſtinct account of the order in which the four goſpels were written. The goſpels, which contain the genealogies, were (he ſays) written firſt, Mark's next, at the inſtance of Peter's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and John's the laſt; and this account he tells us that he had received from Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of more ancient times. This teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony proves the following points; that theſe goſpels were the hiſtories of Chriſt then publicly received, and relied upon; that the dates, occaſions, and circumſtances of their publication, were at that time ſubjects of attention and enquiry amongſt Chriſtians. In the works of Clement which remain, the four Goſpels are repeatedly quoted by the names of their authors, and the Acts of the Apoſtles is expreſsly aſcribed to Luke. In one place, after mentioning a particular circumſtance,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0270800301:229"/>
he adds theſe remarkable words: "We have not this paſſage <hi>in the four goſpels delivered to us,</hi> but in that according to the Egyptians;" which puts a marked diſtinction between the four goſpels and all other hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or pretended hiſtories, of Chriſt. In another part of his works, the perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, with which he received the goſpels, is ſignified by him in theſe words: "That this is true appears from hence, that it is written in the goſpel according to St. Luke;" and again, "I need not uſe many words, but only to alledge the evangelic voice of the Lord." His quotations are numerous. The ſayings of Chriſt, of which he alledges many, are all taken from our goſpels, the ſingle exception to this obſervation appearing to be a looſe <note n="*" place="bottom">"Aſk great things, and the ſmall ſhall be added unto you." Clement rather choſe to expound the words of Matthew (vi. 33) than literally to cite them; and this is moſt undeniably proved by another place in the ſame Clement, where he both produces the text and theſe words as an expoſition:—"Seek ye firſt the kingdom of heaven and its righteouſneſs, for theſe are the great things but the ſmall things, and things relating to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

XII. In the age in which they lived†, Tertullian joins on with Clement. The number of the goſpels then received, the names of the evangeliſts, and their proper deſcriptions, are exhibited by this writer in one ſhort ſentence:—"Among the <hi>apoſtles,</hi> John and Matthew teach us the faith; among <hi>apoſtolical men,</hi> Luke and Mark re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh it." The next paſſage to be taken from Tertullian, affords as complete an atteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the authenticity of our books, as can be well imagined. After enumerating the churches which had been founded by Paul, at Corinth, in Galatia, at Philippi, Theſſalonica, and Epheſus; the church of Rome eſtabliſhed by Peter and Paul; and other churches derived from John; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus:—"I ſay then, that with them, but not with them only which are apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, but with all who have fellowſhip with <note place="bottom">Lardner, vol. ii. p. 561.</note>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0270800301:231"/>
them in the ſame faith, is that goſpel of Luke received from its firſt publication, which we ſo zealouſly maintain:" and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently afterwards adds <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "The ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the apoſtolical churches will ſupport the other goſpels, which we have from them, and according to them, I mean John's and Matthew's, although that likewiſe, which Mark publiſhed, may be ſaid to be Peter's, whoſe interpreter Mark was." In another place Tertullian affirms, that the three other goſpels were in the hands of the churches from the beginning, as well as Luke's. This noble teſtimony ſixes the univerſality with which the goſpels were received, and their antiquity; that they were in the hands of all, and had been ſo from the firſt. And this evidence appears not more than one hundred and fifty years after the publication of the books. The reader muſt be given to underſtand that, when Tertullian ſpeaks of maintaining or defending <hi>(tuendi)</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of St. Luke, he only means maintaining or defending the integrity of the copies of Luke received by Chriſtian churches, in oppoſition
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0270800301:232"/>
to certain curtailed copies uſed by Marcion, againſt whom he writes.</p>
                     <p>This author frequently cites the Acts of the Apoſtles under that title, once calls it Luke's commentary, and obſerves how St. Paul's epiſtles confirm it.</p>
                     <p>After this general evidence, it is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to add particular quotations. Theſe, however, are ſo numerous and ample, as to have led Dr. Lardner to obſerve, "that there are more, and larger, quotations of the ſmall volume of the New Teſtament in this one Chriſtian author, than there are of all the works of Cicero in writers of all characters for ſeveral ages <note n="*" place="bottom">Lard. vol. ii. p. 647.</note>."</p>

We may again likewiſe remark the wide extent through which the reputation of the Goſpels, and of the Acts of the Apoſtles, had ſpread, and the perfect conſent in this point of diſtant and independent ſocieties. It is now only about one hundred and fifty years ſince Chriſt was crucified; and within this period, to ſay nothing of the apoſtolical Fathers who have been noticed already, we have Juſtin Martyr at Neapolis, Theophilus at Antioch, Irenaeus in France, Clement at Alexandria, Tertullian at Carthage, quoting the ſame books of hiſtorical ſcriptures, and, I may ſay, quoting theſe alone.</p>

Nothing can be more peremptory upon the ſubject now under conſideration, and, from a writer of his learning and information, more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, than the declaration of Origen, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in an extract from his works, by Euſebius; "That the four goſpels alone, are received without diſpute, by the whole church of God under heaven:" to which declaration is immediately ſubjoined a brief hiſtory of the reſpective authors, to whom they were then, as they are now, aſcribed. The language holden concerning the goſpels throughout the works of Origen which remain, entirely correſpond with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony here cited. His atteſtation to the Acts of the Apoſtles is no leſs poſitive: "And Luke alſo once more ſounds the trumpet relating the acts of the Apoſtles." The
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0270800301:235"/>
univerſality with which the ſcriptures were then read, is well ſignified by this writer, in a paſſage in which he has occaſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve againſt Celſus, "That it is not in any private books, or ſuch as are read by a few only, and thoſe ſtudious perſons, but in books read by every body, that it is written, the inviſible things of God from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by things that are made." It is to no purpoſe to ſingle out quotations of ſcripture from ſuch a writer as this. We might as well make a ſelection of the quotations of ſcripture in Dr. Clark's ſermons. They are ſo thickly ſown in the works of Origen, that Dr. Mill ſays, "If we had all his works remaining, we ſhould have before us almoſt the whole text of the Bible <note n="*" place="bottom">Mill. proleg. cap. vi. p. 66.</note>."</p>
                     <p>Origen notices, in order to cenſure, certain apocryphal goſpels. He alſo uſes four writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this ſort; that is, throughout his large works he once or twice, at the moſt, quotes
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0270800301:236"/>

obſerving that they were eye-witneſſes of of the facts which they relate, and that their ignorance of the arts of compoſition was rather a confirmation of their teſtimony, than an objection to it.

who had read many which are now loſt. In a paſſage of his evangelical demonſtration, Euſebius remarks, with great nicety, the delicacy of two of the evangeliſts, in their manner of noticing any circumſtance which regarded themſelves, and of Mark, as writing under Peter's direction, in the circumſtances which regarded him. The illuſtration of this remark leads him to bring together long quotations from each of the evangeliſts; and the whole paſſage is a proof, that Euſebius, and the Chriſtians of thoſe days, not only read the goſpels, but ſtudied them with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and exactneſs. In a paſſage of his eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, he treats, in form, and at large, of the occaſions of writing the four goſpels, and of the order in which they were written. The title of the chapter is "Of the Order of the Goſpels;" and it begins thus: "Let us obſerve the writings of this apoſtle John, which are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by any, and, firſt of all, muſt be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as acknowledged by all, the goſpel according to him, well known to all the churches under heaven; and that it has been
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0270800301:241"/>
juſtly placed by the ancients the fourth in order, and after the other three, may be made evident in this manner." Euſebius then proceeds to ſhew that John wrote the laſt of the four, and that his goſpel was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſupply the omiſſions of the others; eſpecially in the part of our Lord's miniſtry, which took place before the impriſonment of John the Baptiſt. He obſerves, "that the apoſtles of Chriſt were not ſtudious of the ornaments of compoſition, nor indeed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to write at all, being wholly occupied with their miniſtry."</p>
                     <p>This learned author makes no uſe at all of Chriſtian writings, forged with the names of Chriſt's apoſtles, or their companions.</p>
                     <p>We cloſe this branch of our evidence here; becauſe, after Euſebius, there is no room for any queſtion upon the ſubject; the works of Chriſtian writers being as full of texts of ſcripture, and of references to ſcripture, as the diſcourſes of modern divines. Future teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to the books of ſcripture could only prove that they never loſt their character or authority.</p>

His words in one place are <note n="*" place="bottom">Lard. Cred. pt. ii. vol. i. p. 180.</note>, "fleeing to the Goſpel as the fleſh of Jeſus, and to the Apoſtles as the preſbytery of the church;" that is, as Le Clerc interprets them, "in order to underſtand the will of God, he fled to the goſpels, which he believed no leſs than if Chriſt in the fleſh had been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him; and to the writings of the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0270800301:252"/>
apoſtles, whom he eſteemed as the preſbytery of the whole Chriſtian church." It muſt be obſerved, that about eighty years after this we have direct proof, in the writings of Clement of Alexandria <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. ii. p. 516.</note>, that theſe two names, "Goſpel" and "Apoſtles," were the names by which the writings of the New Teſtament, and the diviſion of theſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, were uſually expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Another paſſage from Ignatius is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:—"But the Goſpel has ſomewhat in it more excellent, the appearance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his paſſion, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 182.</note>."</p>
                     <p>And a third, "Ye ought to hearken to the Prophets, but eſpecially to the Goſpel, in which the paſſion has been manifeſted to us, and the reſurrection perfected." In this laſt paſſage the prophets and the goſpel are put in conjunction; and as Ignatius undoubtedly meant by the Prophets a collection of writings,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0270800301:253"/>
it is probable that he meant the ſame by the Goſpel, the two terms ſtanding in evident paralleliſm with each other.</p>
                     <p>This interpretation of the word "goſpel" in the paſſages above quoted from Ignatius, is confirmed by a piece of nearly equal anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the relation of the martyrdom of Polycarp by the church of Smyrna. "All things," ſay they, "that went before were done, that the Lord might ſhew us a martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom according to the goſpel, for he expected to be delivered up as the Lord alſo did <note n="*" place="bottom">Ig.

In both theſe places, what is called <hi>the goſpel</hi> ſeems to be the hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his doctrine.</p>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0270800301:254"/>
of the high eſteem in which the books of the New Teſtament were holden.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Euſebius relates, that Quadratus and ſome others, who were the immediate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the apoſtles, travelling abroad to preach Chriſt, carried the goſpels with them, and delivered them to their converts. The words of Euſebius are: "Then travelling abroad, they performed the work of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, being ambitious to preach Chriſt, and <hi>deliver the ſcripture of the divine goſpels</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Lard. Cred. pt. ii. vol. i. p. 236.</note>." Euſebius had before him the writings both of Quadratus himſelf, and of many others of that age, which are now loſt. It is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, therefore, to believe, that he had good grounds for his aſſertion. What is thus recorded of the goſpels took place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſixty, or at the moſt ſeventy, years after they were publiſhed: and it is evident, that they muſt, before this time (and, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, long before this time), have been in general uſe, and in high eſteem in the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0270800301:255"/>
churches planted by the apoſtles, inaſmuch as they were now, we find, collected into a volume; and the immediate ſucceſſors of the apoſtles, they who preached the religion of Chriſt to thoſe who had not already heard it, carried the volume with them, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to their converts.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Irenaeus, in the year 178 <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. i. p. 383.</note>, puts the evangelic and apoſtolic writings in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the law and the prophets, manifeſtly intending by the one a code or collection of Chriſtian ſacred writings, as the other expreſſed the code or collection of Jewiſh ſacred writings. And</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Melito, at this time biſhop of Sardis, writing to one Oneſimus, tells his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 331.</note>, that he had procured an accurate account of the books of the OLD Teſtament. The occurrence, in this paſſage, of the term <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, has been brought to prove, and it certainly does prove, that there was
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0270800301:256"/>
then a volume or collection of writings called the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. In the time of Clement of Alexandria, about fifteen years after the laſt quoted teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it is apparent that the Chriſtian ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were divided into two parts, under the general titles of the Goſpels and Apoſtles; and that both theſe were regarded as of the higheſt authority. One, out of many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Clement alluding to this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, is the following:—"There is a conſent and harmony between the law and the prophets, the apoſtles and the goſpel <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. ii. p. 516.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. The ſame diviſion, "Prophets, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, and Apoſtles," appears in Tertullian <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 631.</note>, the contemporary of Clement. The col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the goſpels is likewiſe called by this writer the "Evangelic Inſtrument <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ib. p. 574.</note>;" the whole volume, the "New Teſtament;" and the two parts, the "Goſpels and Apoſtles <note n="§" place="bottom">Ib. p. 632.</note>."</p>

VII. From many writers alſo of the third century, and eſpecially from Cyprian, who lived in the middle of it, it is collected, that the Chriſtian ſcriptures were divided into two codes or volumes, one called the "Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels or Scriptures of the Lord," the other, the "Apoſtles, or Epiſtles of the Apoſtles <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iv. p. 846.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Euſebius, as we have already ſeen, takes ſome pains to ſhew, that the goſpel of St. John had been juſtly placed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients "the fourth in order, and after the other three <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. vol. viii. p. 90.</note>." Theſe are the terms of his propoſition: and the very introduction of ſuch an argument proves inconteſtably, that the four Goſpels had been collected into a volume, to the excluſion of every other; that their order in the volume had been adjuſted with much conſideration; and that this had been done by thoſe who were called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in the time of Euſebius.</p>
                     <p>In the Diocletian perſecution in the year

303, the ſcriptures were ſought out and burnt <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. vii. p. 214 et ſeq.</note>; many ſuffered death rather than deliver them up; and thoſe who betrayed them to the perſecutors were accounted as lapſed and apoſtate. On the other hand, Conſtantine, after his converſion, gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for multiplying copies of the divine oracles, and for magnificently adorning them at the expence of the imperial treaſury <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 432.</note>. What the Chriſtians of that age ſo richly embelliſhed in their proſperity, and, which is more, ſo tenaciouſly preſerved under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, was the very volume of the New Teſtament which we now read.</p>

Moreover the text quoted by Polycarp is a text found in the collection at this day. What alſo the ſame Polycarp hath elſewhere quoted in the ſame manner, may be conſidered as proved to belong to the collection; and this comprehends St.

It does not appear what elſe Polycarp could mean by the "ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Lord," but thoſe ſame "holy ſcriptures," or ſacred writings, of which he had ſpoken before.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Juſtin Martyr, whoſe apology was written about thirty years after Polycarp's epiſtle, expreſsly cites ſome of our preſent hiſtories under the title of GOSPEL, and that, not as a name by him firſt aſcribed to them, but as the name by which they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known in his time. His words are theſe:—"For the apoſtles, in the memoirs compoſed by them, <hi>which are called goſpels,</hi> have thus delivered it, that Jeſus command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to take bread, and give thanks <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ib. p. 271.</note>."

There exiſts no doubt, but that, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs above mentioned, Juſtin meant our preſent hiſtorical ſcriptures, for, throughout his works, he quotes theſe, and no others.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Dionyſius, biſhop of Corinth, who came thirty years after Juſtin, in a paſſage preſerved in Euſebius (for his works are loſt), ſpeaks of "the ſcriptures of the Lord <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. i. p. 298.</note>."</p>

A few ſhort obſervations will ſhew the value of this teſtimony.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The "memoirs of the apoſtles," Juſtin in another place expreſsly tells us, are what are called "goſpels;" and that they were the goſpels, which we now uſe, is made certain by Juſtin's numerous quotations of <hi>them,</hi> and his ſilence about any others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Juſtin deſcribes the general uſage of the Chriſtian church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Juſtin does not ſpeak of it as recent or newly inſtituted, but in the terms in which men ſpeak of eſtabliſhed cuſtoms.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Tertullian, who followed Juſtin at the diſtance of about fifty years, in his account of the religious aſſemblies of Chriſtians as they were conducted in his time, ſays, "We come together to recollect the divine ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; we nouriſh our faith, raiſe our hope, confirm our truſt, by the ſacred word <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. ii. p. 628.</note>."</p>

                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0270800301:266"/>
III. Euſebius records of Origen, and cites for his authority the letters of Biſhops contemporary with Origen, that, when he went into Paleſtine about the year 216, which was only 16 years after the date of Tertullian's teſtimony, he was deſired by the Biſhops of that country to diſcourſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſcriptures publicly in the church; though he was not yet ordained a preſbyter <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iii. p. 68.</note>. This anecdote recognizes the uſage, not only of reading, but of expounding, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and both as ſubſiſting in full force. Origen alſo himſelf bears witneſs to the ſame practice: "This (ſays he) we do, when the ſcriptures are read in the church, and when the diſcourſe for explication is delivered to the people <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 302.</note>." And, what is a ſtill more ample teſtimony, many homilies of his upon the ſcriptures of the New Teſtament, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him in the aſſemblies of the church, are ſtill extant.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Cyprian, whoſe age was not twenty
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0270800301:267"/>
years lower than that of Origen, gives his people an account of having ordained two perſons, who were before confeſſors, to be readers; and what they were to read, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the reaſon which he gives for his choice:—"Nothing (ſays Cyprian) can be more fit, than that he, who has made a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious confeſſion of the Lord, ſhould read publicly in the church; that he who has ſhewn himſelf willing to die a martyr, ſhould read the <hi>goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> by which martyrs are made <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iv. p. 842.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Intimations of the ſame cuſtom may be traced in a great number of writers in the beginning and throughout the whole of the fourth century. Of theſe teſtimonies I will only uſe one, as being, of itſelf, expreſs and full. Auguſtine, who appeared near the concluſion of the century, diſplays the benefit of the Chriſtian religion on this very account, the public reading of the ſcriptures in the churches, "where (ſays he) is a confluence
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0270800301:268"/>
of all ſorts of people of both ſexes, and where they hear how they ought to live well in this world, that they may deſerve to live happily and eternally in another." And this cuſtom he declares to be univerſal: "The canonical books of ſcripture being read every where, the miracles therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded are well known to all people <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. x. p. 276 et ſeq.</note>."</p>
                     <p>It does not appear that any books, other than our preſent ſcriptures, were thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly read, except that the epiſtle of Clement was read in the church of Corinth, to which it had been addreſſed, and in ſome others; and that the Shepherd of Hermas was read in many churches. Nor does it ſubtract much from the value of the argument, that theſe two writings partly come within it, becauſe we allow them to be the genuine writings of apoſtolical men. There is not the leaſt evidence, that any other goſpel, than the four which we receive, was ever admitted to this diſtinction.</p>

                     <p>NO greater proof can be given of the eſteem in which theſe books were holden by the ancient Chriſtians, or of the ſenſe then entertained of their value and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, than the induſtry beſtowed upon them. And it ought to be obſerved, that the value and importance of theſe books conſiſted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in their genuineneſs and truth. There was nothing in them as works of taſte, or as compoſitions, which could have induced any one to have written a note upon them.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0270800301:275"/>
of ſhewing the ſentiments and ſtudies of learned Chriſtians of that age, to notice the following:</p>
                     <p>Euſebius, in the very beginning of the century, wrote expreſsly upon the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancies obſervable in the goſpels, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a treatiſe, in which he pointed out what things are related by four, what by three, what by two, and what by one evangeliſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. viii. p. 46.</note>. This author alſo teſtifies, what is certainly a material piece of evidence, "that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the apoſtles had obtained ſuch an eſteem, as to be tranſlated into every lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage both of Greeks and Barbarians, and to be diligently ſtudied by all nations <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 201.</note>." This teſtimony was given about the year 300; how long <hi>before</hi> that date theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were made, does not appear.</p>
                     <p>Damaſus, biſhop of Rome, correſponded with St. Jerome upon the expoſition of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult texts of ſcripture; and, in a letter ſtill
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0270800301:276"/>
remaining, deſires Jerome to give him a clear explanation of the word Hoſanna, found in the New Teſtament; "he (Damaſus) hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met with very different interpretations of it in the Greek and Latin commentaries of catholic writers which he had read <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. ix. p. 108.</note>." This laſt clauſe ſhews the number and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of commentaries then extant.</p>
                     <p>Gregory of Nyſſen, at one time, appeals to the moſt exact copies of St. Mark's goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; at another time, compares together, and propoſes to reconcile, the ſeveral accounts of the reſurrection <hi>given by the four evangeliſts;</hi> which limitation proves, that there were no other hiſtories of Chriſt deemed authentic beſide theſe, or included in the ſame cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with theſe. This writer obſerves, acutely enough, that the diſpoſition of the clothes in the ſepulchre, the naplkin that was about our Saviour's head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itſelf, did not beſpeak the terror
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0270800301:277"/>
and hurry of thieves, and therefore reſutes the ſtory of the body being ſtolen <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. ix. p. 163.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſe, biſhop of Milan, remarked va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious readings in the Latin copies of the New Teſtament, and appeals to the original Greek;</p>
                     <p>And Jerome, towards the concluſion of this century, put forth an edition of the New Teſtament in Latin, corrected, at leaſt as to the goſpels, by Greek copies, "and thoſe (he ſays) ancient."</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Chryſoſtom, it is well known, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and publiſhed a great many homilies, or ſermons, upon the Goſpels and the Acts of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>It is needleſs to bring down this article lower; but it is of importance to add, that there is no example of Chriſtian writers of the three firſt centuries compoſing comments
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0270800301:278"/>
upon any other books than thoſe which are found in the New Teſtament, except the ſingle one, of Clement of Alexandria, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting upon a book called the Revelation of Peter.</p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>ancient verſions</hi> of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one of the moſt valuable is the Syriac. Syriac was the language of Paleſtine when Chriſtianity was there firſt eſtabliſhed. And although the books of ſcripture were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Greek, for the purpoſe of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended circulation than within the precincts of Judea, yet it is probable that they would ſoon be tranſlated into the vulgar language of the country where the religion firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. Accordingly a Syriac tranſlation is now extant, all along, ſo far as it appears, uſed by the inhabitants of Syria, bearing many internal marks of high antiquity, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in its pretenſions by the uniform tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Eaſt, and confirmed by the diſcovery of many very ancient manuſcripts in the libraries of Europe. It is about 200 years ſince a Biſhop of Antioch ſent a copy
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0270800301:279"/>
of this tranſlation into Europe, to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this ſeems to be the firſt time that the tranſlation became generally known to theſe parts of the world. The Biſhop of Antioch's teſtament was found to contain all our books, except the ſecond epiſtle of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſecond and third of John, and the Revelation; which books, however, have ſince been diſcovered in that language in ſome ancient manuſcripts of Europe. But in this collection, no other book, beſide what is in ours, appears ever to have had a place. And, which is very worthy of obſervation, the text, though preſerved in a remote coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and without communication with ours, differs from ours very little, and in nothing that is important <note n="*" place="bottom">Jones on the Canon, vol. i. c. xiv.</note>.</p>

                     <p>THE three moſt ancient topics of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy amongſt Chriſtians, were, the authority of the Jewiſh inſtitution, the origin of evil, and the nature of Chriſt. Upon the firſt of theſe, we find, in very early times, one claſs of heretics rejecting the Old Teſtament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; another, contending for the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its law, in all its parts, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its whole extent, and over every one who ſought acceptance with God. Upon the two latter ſubjects a natural, perhaps, and venial; but a fruitleſs, eager, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient curioſity, prompted by the philoſophy
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0270800301:281"/>
and by the ſcholaſtic habits of the age, which carried men much into bold hypotheſes and conjectural ſolutions, raiſed, amongſt ſome who profeſſed Chriſtianity, very wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded opinions. I think there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that the number of theſe bore any conſiderable proportion to the body of the Chriſtian church; and amidſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, which ſuch opinions neceſſarily occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, it is a great ſatisfaction to perceive, what in a vaſt plurality of inſtances we do perceive, all ſides recurring to the ſame ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p n="1">I <note n="*" place="bottom">The materials of the ſormer part of this ſection are taken from Dr. Lardner's hiſtory of the hereties of the two firſt centuries, publiſhed ſince his death, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, by the Rev.

Baſilides lived near the age of the apoſtles, about the year 120, or, perhaps, ſooner <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. ix. p. 271.</note>. He rejected the Jewiſh inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not as ſpurious, but as proceeding from a being inferior to the true God; and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0270800301:282"/>
in other reſpects advanced a ſcheme of theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy widely different from the general doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Chriſtian church, and which, as it gained over ſome diſciples, was warmly oppoſed by Chriſtian writers of the ſecond and third century. In theſe writings there is poſitive evidence, that Baſilides received the goſpel of Matthew; and there is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof that he rejected any of the other three; on the contrary, it appears that he wrote a commentary upon the goſpel, ſo copious as to be divided into twenty-four books <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. ix. ed. 1788, p. 305, 306.</note>.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Valentinians appeared about the ſame time <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. pa. 350, 351.</note>. Their hereſy conſiſted in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain notions concerning angelic natures, which can hardly be rendered intelligible to a modern reader. They ſeem, however, to have acquired as much importance as any of the ſeparatiſts of that early age. Of this ſect, Irenaeus, who wrote A. D. 172, expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly records, that they endeavoured to fetch
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0270800301:283"/>
arguments for their opinions, from the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic and apoſtolic writings <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. i. p. 383.</note>. Heracleon, one of the moſt celebrated of the ſect, and who lived probably ſo early as the year 125, wrote commentaries upon Luke and John <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. ix. ed. 1788, p. 352.</note>. Some obſervations alſo of his upon Matthew are preſerved by Origen <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ib. 353.</note>. Nor is there any reaſon to doubt, that he received the whole New Teſtament.</p>

                     <p n="6">VI. From a writer, quoted by Euſebius, of alout the year 200, it is apparent that they, who, at that time, contended for the mere humanity of Chriſt, argued from the ſcriptures; for they are accuſed by this
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0270800301:285"/>
writer, of making alterations in their copies; in order to favour their opinions <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iii: p. 46.</note>.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Origen's ſentiments excited great controverſies, the Biſhops of Rome and Alexandria, and many others, condemning, the Biſhops of the Eaſt eſpouſing them; yet there is not the ſmalleſt queſtion, but that both the advocates and adverſaries of theſe opinions acknowledged the ſame authority of ſcripture. In his time, which the reader will remember was about one hundred and fifty years after the ſcriptures were publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many diffentions ſubſiſted amongſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, with which they were reproached by Celſus; yet Origen, who has recorded this accuſation without contradicting it, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs teſtifies, "that the four goſpels were received <hi>without diſpute,</hi> by the whole church of God under heaven <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iv. p. 642.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Paul of Samoſata, about thirty years after Origen, ſo diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0270800301:286"/>
controverſy concerning the nature of Chriſt, as to be the ſubject of two councils, or ſynods, aſſembled at Antioch, upon his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Yet he is not charged by his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries with rejecting any book of the New Teſtament. On the contrary, Epiphanius, who wrote a hiſtory of heretics a hundred years afterwards, ſays, that Paul endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſupport his doctrine by texts of ſcripture. And Vincentius Lirinenſis, A. D. 434, ſpeaking of Paul and other heretics of the ſame age, has theſe words: "Here, perhaps, ſome one may aſk, whether here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics alſo urge the teſtimony of ſcripture. They urge it indeed, explicitly and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently; for you may ſee them flying through every book of the ſacred law <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. xi. p. 158.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. A controverſy at the ſame time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted with the Noetians or Sabellians, who ſeem to have gone into the oppoſite extreme from that of Paul of Samoſata, and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Yet, according to the expreſs teſtimony
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0270800301:287"/>
of Epiphanius, Sabellius received all the ſcriptures. And with both ſects catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic writers conſtantly alledge the ſcriptures, and reply to the arguments which their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents drew from particular texts.</p>
                     <p>We have here, therefore, a proof, that parties, who were the moſt oppoſite and irreconcileable to one another, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the authority of ſcripture with equal deference.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. And as a general teſtimony to the ſame point, may be produced what was ſaid by one of the Biſhops of the council of Carthage, which was holden a little before this time. "I am of opinion that blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and wicked heretics, who <hi>pervert</hi> the ſacred and adorable words of the ſcriptures, ſhould be execrated <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. xi. p. 839.</note>." Undoubtedly what they perverted, they received.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. The Millenium, Novatianiſm, the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0270800301:288"/>
baptiſm of heretics, the keeping of Eaſter, engaged alſo the attention, and divided the opinions of Chriſtians, at and before that time (and, by the way, it may be obſerved, that ſuch diſputes, though on ſome accounts to be blamed, ſhewed how much men were in earneſt upon the ſubject), yet every one appealed for the grounds of his opinion to ſcripture authority. Dionyſius of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, who flouriſhed A. D. 247, deſcribing a conference, or public diſputation, with the Millenarians of Egypt, confeſſes of them, though their adverſary, "that they embraced whatever could be made out by good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the holy ſcriptures <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iv. p. 666.</note>." Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, A. D. 251, diſtinguiſhed by ſome rigid ſentiments concerning the reception of thoſe who had lapſed, and the founder of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſect, in his few remaining works quotes the goſpel with the ſame reſpect as other Chriſtians did; and concerning his followers the teſtimony of Socrates, who wrote about the year 440, is poſitive, viz.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0270800301:289"/>
"That, in the diſputes between the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics and them, each ſide endeavoured to ſupport itſelf by the authority of the divine ſcriptures <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. v. p. 105.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. The Donatiſts, who ſprung up in the year 328, uſed the ſame ſcriptures as we do. "Produce (ſaith Auguſtine) ſome proof from the ſcriptures, whoſe authority is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us both <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. vol. vii. p. 243.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. It is perfectly notorious, that, in the Arian controverſy, which aroſe ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the year 300, both ſides appealed to the ſame ſcriptures, and with equal profeſſions of deference and regard. The Arians, in their council of Antioch, A. D. 341, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that, "if any one, contrary to the ſound doctrine of the ſcriptures, ſay that the ſon is a creature, as one of the creatures, let him be anathema <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ib. p. 277.</note>." They and the Athanaſians
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0270800301:290"/>
mutually accuſe each other of uſing <hi>unſcriptural</hi> phraſes, which was a mutual acknowledgment of the concluſive authority of ſcripture.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. The Priſcillianiſts, A. D, 378 <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. ix. p. 325.</note>, the Pelagians, A. D. 405 <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. vol. xi. p. 52.</note>, received the ſame ſcriptures as we do.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. The teſtimony of Chryſoſtom, who lived near the year 400, is ſo poſitive in aſſirmation of the propoſition which we maintain, that it may form a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the argument. "The general reception of the goſpels is a proof that their hiſtory is true and conſiſtent; for, ſince the writing of the goſpels, many hereſies have ariſen, holding opinions contrary to what is contained in them, who yet receive the goſpels either entire or in part <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ib. vol. x. p. 316.</note>." I am not moved by what may ſeem a deduction
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0270800301:291"/>
from Chryſoſtom's teſtimony, the words "entire or in part;" for, if all the parts, which were ever queſtioned in our goſpels, were given up, it would not affect the miraculous origin of the religion in the ſmalleſt degree: <hi>e. g.</hi>

                     <p>Cerinthus is ſaid by Epiphanius to have received the goſpel of Matthew, but not entire. What the omiſſions were does not appear.

It is agreed, however, by all who have given any account of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus, that he taught that the Holy Ghoſt (whether he meant by that name a perſon or a power) deſcended upon Jeſus at his baptiſm; that Jeſus from this time perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many miracles, and that he appeared after his death.

One of his tenets was the rejection of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as proceeding from an inferior and imperſect deity; and in purſuance of this hypotheſis, he craſed from the New, and that, as it ſhould ſeem, without entering into any critical reaſons, every paſſage which recognized the Jewiſh ſcriptures. He ſpared not a text which contradicted his opinion. It is reaſonable to believe, that Marcion treated books as he treated texts: yet this raſh and wild controverſialiſt publiſhed a recenſion, or chaſtiſed edition, of St. Luke's goſpel, containing the leading facts, and all which is neceſſary to authenticate the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. This example affords proof, that there were always ſome points, and thoſe the main points, which neither wildneſs nor raſhneſs, neither the ſury of oppoſition nor the intemperance of controverſy, would venture to call in queſtion.

                     <p>I STATE this propoſition, becauſe, if made out, it ſhews that the authenticity of their books was a ſubject amongſt the early Chriſtians of conſideration and enquiry; and that, where there was cauſe of doubt, they did doubt; a circumſtance which ſtrengthens very much their teſtimony to ſuch books as were received by them with full acquieſcence.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Jerome, in his account of Caius, who was probably a preſbyter of Rome, and who flouriſhed near the year 200, records of him, that, reckoning up only thirteen

epiſtles of Paul, he ſays the fourteenth, which is inſcribed to the Hebrews, is not his; and then Jerome adds, "With the Romans to this day it is not looked upon as Paul's." This agrees, in the main, with the account given by Euſebius of the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient author and his work; except that Euſebius delivers his own remark in more guarded terms, "and indeed to this very time, by <hi>ſome</hi> of the Romans, this epiſtle is not thought to be the apoſtle's <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iii. p. 240.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Origen, about twenty years after Caius, quoting the epiſtle to the Hebrews, obſerves that ſome might diſpute the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that epiſtle, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to quote to the ſame point, as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted</hi> books of ſcripture, the Goſpel of St. Matthew, the Acts of the Apoſtles, and Paul's firſt Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 246.</note>. And in another place, this author ſpeaks of the Epiſtle to the Hebrews thus:—"The account come down to us is various, ſome

ſaying that Clement, who was biſhop of Rome, wrote this epiſtle; others, that it was Luke, the ſame who writ the Goſpel and the Acts." Speaking alſo in the ſame paragraph of Peter, "Peter (ſays he) has left one epiſtle acknowledged; let it be granted likewiſe that he wrote a ſecond, for it is doubted of." And of John, "He has alſo left one epiſtle, of a very few lines; grant alſo a ſecond and a third, for all do not allow theſe to be genuine." Now let it be noted, that Origen, who thus diſcriminates, and thus confeſſes his own doubts, and the doubts which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his time, expreſsly witneſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the four goſpels, "that they alone are received without diſpute by the whole church of God under heaven <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iii. p. 234.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Dionyſius of Alexandria, in the year 247, doubts concerning the Book of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, whether it was written by St. John; ſtates the grounds of his doubt; repreſents the diverſity of opinion concerning it, in his

own time, and before his time <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iv. p. 670.</note>. Yet the ſame Dionyſius uſes and collates the four goſpels, in a manner which ſhews that he entertained not the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion of <hi>their</hi> authority, and in a manner alſo which ſhews that they, and they alone, were received as authentic hiſtories of Chriſt <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 661.</note>.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. But this ſection may be ſaid to have been framed on purpoſe to introduce to the reader two remarkable paſſages, extant in Euſebius's eccleſiaſtical hiſtory. The firſt paſſage opens with theſe words—"Let us obſerve the writings of the apoſtle John, which are <hi>uncontradicted;</hi> and, firſt of all, muſt be mentioned, as acknowledged of all, the goſpel according to him, well known to all the churches under heaven." The author then proceeds to relate the occaſions of writing the goſpels, and the reaſons for pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing St. John's the laſt, manifeſtly ſpeaking of all the four as parallel in their authority, and in the certainty of their original <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ib. vol. viii. p. 90.</note>. The
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0270800301:299"/>
ſecond paſſage is taken from a chapter, the title of which is, "Of the Scriptures <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged,</hi> and of thoſe that are not ſuch." Euſebius begins his enumeration in the following manner:—"<hi>In the firſt place,</hi> are to be ranked the ſacred four Goſpels, then the book of the Acts of the Apoſtles, after that are to be reckoned the Epiſtles of Paul. In the next place, that called the firſt Epiſtle of John, and the Epiſtle of Peter, are to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed authentic. After this is to be placed, if it be thought fit, the Revelation of John, about which we ſhall obſerve the different opinions at proper ſeaſons. Of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but yet well known, or approved by the moſt, are that called the Epiſtle of James, and that of Jude, and the ſecond of Peter, and the ſecond and third of John, whether they are written by the evangeliſt, or another of the ſame name <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. viii. p. 89.</note>." He then proceeds to reckon up five others, not in our canon, which he calls in one place <hi>ſpurious,</hi> in another
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0270800301:300"/>
                        <hi>controverted,</hi> meaning, as appears to me; nearly the ſame thing by theſe two words <note n="*" place="bottom">That Euſebius could not intend, by the word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered "ſpurious," what we at preſent mean by it, is evident from a clauſe in this very chapter, where, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpels of Peter and Thomas, and Matthias and ſome others, he ſays, "They are not ſo much as to be reckoned among the <hi>ſpurious,</hi> but are to be rejected as altogether abſurd and impious." Vol. viii. p. 98.</note>.</p>
                     <p>It is manifeſt from this paſſage, that the four Goſpels, and the Acts of the Apoſtles, (the parts of ſcripture with which our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern principally lies) were acknowledged without diſpute, even by thoſe who raiſed objections, or entertained doubts, about ſome other parts of the ſame collection. But the paſſage proves ſomething more than this. The author was extremely converſant in the writings of Chriſtians, which had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed from the commencement of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to his own time; and it was from theſe writings that he drew his knowledge of the character and reception of the books in queſtion. That Euſebius recurred to this
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0270800301:301"/>
medium of information, and that he had examined with attention this ſpecies of proof, is ſhewn, firſt, by a paſſage in the very chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we are quoting, in which, ſpeaking of the books which he calls ſpurious, "None (he ſays) of the eccleſiaſtical writers, in the ſucceſſion of the apoſtles, have vouchſafed to make any mention of them in their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;" and ſecondly, by another paſſage of the ſame work, wherein, ſpeaking of the firſt epiſtle of Peter, "This (he ſays) the preſbyters of ancient times have quoted in their writings as undoubtedly genuine <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. p. 99.</note>;" and then, ſpeaking of ſome other writings bearing the name of Peter, "We know (he ſays) that they have not been delivered down to us in the number of catholic writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, foraſmuch as no eccleſiaſtical writer of the ancients, or of our times, has made uſe of teſtimonies out of them." "But in the progreſs of this hiſtory," the author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, "we ſhall make it our buſineſs to ſhew, together with the ſucceſſions from the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0270800301:302"/>
apoſtles, what eccleſiaſtical writers, in every age, have uſed ſuch writings as theſe which are contradicted, and what they have ſaid, with regard to the ſcriptures received in the New Teſtament, <hi>and acknowledged by all,</hi> and with regard to thoſe which are not ſuch <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. p. 111.</note>."</p>
                     <p>After this it is reaſonable to believe, that, when Euſebius ſtates the four Goſpels, and the Acts of the Apoſtles, as uncontradicted, unconteſted, and acknowledged by all; and when he places them in oppoſition, not only to thoſe which were ſpurious in our ſenſe of that term, but to thoſe which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, and even to thoſe which were well known and approved by many, yet doubted of by ſome; he repreſents, not only the ſenſe of his own age, but the reſult of the evidence, which the writings of prior ages, from the apoſtle's time to his own, had furniſhed to his enquiries. The opinion of Euſebius and his contemporaries, appears to have been founded upon the teſtimony of writers,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0270800301:303"/>
whom they <hi>then</hi> called ancient; and we may obſerve, that ſuch of the works of theſe writers, as have come down to our times, entirely conſirm the judgement, and ſupport the diſtinction which Euſebius propoſes. The books, which he calls "books univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged," are in fact uſed and quoted, in the remaining works of Chriſtian writers, during the 250 years between the apoſtle's time and that of Euſebius, much more frequently than, and in a different manner from, thoſe, the authority of which, he tells us, was diſputed.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. NEAR the middle of the ſecond cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, Celſus, a heathen philoſopher, wrote a profeſſed treatiſe againſt Chriſtianity. To this treatiſe, Origen, who came about fifty years after him, publiſhed an anſwer, in which he frequently recites his adverſary's words and arguments. The work of Celſus is loſt; but that of Origen remains. Origen appears to have given us the words of Celſus, where he profeſſes to give them, very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and, amongſt other reaſons for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, this is one, that the objection, as ſtated by him from Celſus, is ſometimes ſtronger than his own anſwer. I think it alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that Origen, in his anſwer, has retailed
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0270800301:305"/>
a large portion of the work of Celſus: "That it may not be ſuſpected (he ſays) that we paſs by any chapters, becauſe we have no anſwers at hand, I have thought it beſt, according to my ability, to confute every thing propoſed by him, not ſo much obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural order of things, as the order which he has taken himſelf <note n="*" place="bottom">Or. cont. Celſ. l. i. ſect. 41.</note>."</p>
                     <p>Celſus wrote about 100 years after the Goſpels were publiſhed; and therefore any notices of theſe books from him are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely important for their antiquity. They are, however, rendered more ſo by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the author; for the reception, credit, and notoriety of theſe books muſt have been well eſtabliſhed amongſt Chriſtians, to have made them ſubjects of animadverſion and oppoſition by ſtrangers and by enemies. It evinces the truth of what Chryſoſtom, two centuries afterwards, obſerved, that "the Goſpels, when written, were not hid in a corner, or buried in obſcurity, but they were
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0270800301:306"/>
made known to all the world, before ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as well as others, even as they are now <note n="*" place="bottom">In Mat. hom. i. 7.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Celſus, or the Jew whom he perſonates, uſes theſe words—"I could ſay many things concerning the affairs of Jeſus, and thoſe, too, different from thoſe written by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Jeſus, but I purpoſely omit them <note n="†" place="bottom">Lardner's Jewiſh and Heathen Teſtim. vol. ii. p. 274.</note>." Upon this paſſage it has been rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it is not eaſy to believe, that if Celſus could have contradicted the diſciples upon good evidence in any material point, he would have omitted to do ſo; and that the aſſertion is, what Origen calls it, a mere oratorical flouriſh.</p>
                     <p>It is ſufficient however to prove, that, in the time of Celſus, there were books well known, and allowed to be written by the diſciples of Jeſus, which books contained a hiſtory of him. By the term <hi>diſciple,</hi> Celſus
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0270800301:307"/>
does not mean the followers of Jeſus in general, for them he calls Chriſtians, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or the like, but thoſe who had been taught by Jeſus himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> his apoſtles and companions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In another paſſage, Celſus accuſes the Chriſtians of altering the goſpel <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. p. 275.</note>. The accuſation refers to ſome variations in the readings of particular paſſages; for Celſus goes on to object, that when they are preſſed hard, and one reading has been confuted, they diſown that, and fly to another. We cannot perceive from Origen that Celſus ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified any particular inſtances, and without ſuch ſpecification the charge is of no value. But the true concluſion to be drawn from it is, that there were in the hands of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, hiſtories, which were even then of ſome ſtanding; for various readings and corruptions do not take place in recent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</p>
                     <p>The former quotation, the reader will
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0270800301:308"/>
remember, proved that theſe books were compoſed by the diſciples of Jeſus, ſtrictly ſo called; the preſent quotation ſhews, that though objections were taken by the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the religion to the integrity of theſe books, none were made to their genuineneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In a third paſſage, the Jew, whom Celſus introduces, ſhuts up an argument in this manner:—"Theſe things then we have alledged to you out of <hi>your own writings,</hi> not needing any other weapons <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. p. 276.</note>." It is maniſeſt that this boaſt proceeds upon the ſuppoſition that the books, over which the writer affects to triumph, poſſeſſed an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by which Chriſtians confeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be bound.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the books to which Celſus refers were no other than our preſent Goſpels, is made out by his alluſions to various paſſages ſtill found in theſe Goſpels. Celſus takes notice of the <hi>genealogies,</hi> which ſixes two of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0270800301:309"/>
theſe goſpels; of the precepts, Reſiſt not him that injures you, and, If a man ſtrike thee on the one cheek, offer to him the other alſo <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. p. 276.</note>; of the woes denounced by Chriſt; of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; of his ſaying that it is impoſſible to ſerve two maſters <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 277.</note>; of the purple robe, the crown of thorns, and the reed in his hand; of the blood that flowed from the body of Jeſus upon the croſs <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ib. p. 280, 281.</note>, which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is recorded by John alone; and (what is inſtar omnium for the purpoſe for which we produce it) of the difference in the accounts given of the reſurrection by the evangeliſts, ſome mentioning two angels at the ſepulchre, others only one <note n="§" place="bottom">Ib. p. 282.</note>.</p>
                     <p>It is extremely material to remark, that Celſus not only perpetually referred to the accounts of Chriſt contained in the four Goſpels <note n="‖" place="bottom">The particulars, of which the above are only a few, are well collected by Mr. Bryant, p. 140.</note>, but that he referred to no other accounts; that he founded none of his objections
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0270800301:310"/>
to Chriſtianity upon any thing deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in ſpurious goſpels.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. What Celſus was in the ſecond cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, Porphyry became in the third. His work, which was a large and formal treatiſe againſt the Chriſtian religion, is not extant. We muſt be content therefore to gather his objections from Chriſtian writers, who have noticed in order to anſwer them: and enough remains of this ſpecies of information, to prove completely, that Porphyry's animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions were directed againſt the contents of our preſent Goſpels, and of the Acts of the Apoſtles; Porphyry conſidering that to overthrow <hi>them</hi> was to overthrow the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Thus he objects to the repetition of a generation in St. Matthew's genealogy; to Matthew's call; to the quotation of a text from Iſaiah, which is found in a pſalm aſcribed to Aſaph; to the calling of the lake of Tiberias a ſea; to the expreſſion in St. Matthew, "the abomination of deſolation;" to the variation in Matthew and Mark upon the text "the voice of one crying in the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0270800301:311"/>
wilderneſs," Matthew citing it from Iſaias, Mark from the prophets; to John's applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the term "Word;" to Chriſt's change of intention about going up to the feaſt of tabernacles (John vii. 8); to the judgement denounced by St. Peter upon Ananias and Sapphira, which he calls an imprecation of death <note n="*" place="bottom">Jewiſh and Heathen Teſt. vol. iii. p. 166 et ſeq.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The inſtances here alledged ſerve, in ſome meaſure, to ſhew the nature of Porphyry's objections, and prove that Porphyry had read the Goſpels with that ſort of attention, which a writer would employ, who regarded them as the depoſitaries of the religion which he attacked. Beſide theſe ſpecifications, there exiſts in the writings of ancient Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians general evidence, that the places of ſcripture, upon which Porphyry had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, were v ey numerous.</p>
                     <p>In ſome of the above cited examples, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, ſpeaking of St. Matthew, calls him
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0270800301:312"/>
                        <hi>your evangeliſt;</hi> he alſo uſes the term Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts in the plural number. What was ſaid of Celſus is true likewiſe of Porphyry, that it does not appear that he conſidered any hiſtory of Chriſt, except theſe, as having authority with Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. A third great writer againſt the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion was the Emperor Julian, whoſe work was compoſed about a century after that of Porphyry.</p>
                     <p>In various long extracts, tranſcribed from this work by Cyril and Jerome, it appears <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. iv. p. 77 et ſeq.</note>, that Julian noticed <hi>by name</hi> Matthew and Luke, in the difference between their genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies of Chriſt; that he objected to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew's application of the prophecy, "Out of Egypt have I called my ſon" (ii. 15), and to that of "a virgin ſhall conceive" (i. 22); that he recited ſayings of Chriſt, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paſſages of his hiſtory, in the very words of the evangeliſts; in particular, that
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0270800301:313"/>
Jeſus healed lame and blind people, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſed demoniacs, in the villages of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida and Bethany; that he alledged that none of Chriſt's diſciples aſcribed to him the creation of the world, except John; that neither Paul, nor Matthew, nor Luke, nor Mark, have dared to call Jeſus, God; that John wrote later than the other evangeliſts, and at a time when a great number of men in the cities of Greece and Italy were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that he alludes to the converſion of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius and of Sergius Paulus, to Peter's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to the circular letter ſent by the apoſtles and elders at Jeruſalem, which are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Acts of the Apoſtles: by which quoting of the four Goſpels and the Acts of the Apoſtles, and by quoting no other, Julian ſhews that theſe were the hiſtorical books, and the only hiſtorical books, received by Chriſtians as of authority, and as the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic memoirs of Jeſus Chriſt, of his apoſtles, and of the doctrines taught by them. But Julian's teſtimony does ſomething more than repreſent the judgement of the Chriſtian church in his time. It diſcovers alſo his
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0270800301:314"/>
own. He himſelf expreſsly ſtates the early date of theſe records: he calls them by the names which they now bear. He all along ſuppoſes, he nowhere attempts to queſtion, their genuineneſs.</p>
                     <p>The argument in favour of the books of the New Teſtament, drawn from the notice taken of their contents by the early writers againſt the religion, is very conſiderable. It proves that the accounts, which Chriſtians had then, were the accounts which we have now; that our preſent ſcriptures were theirs. It proves, moreover, that neither Celſus in the ſecond, Porphyry in the third, nor Julian in the fourth century, ſuſpected the authenticity of theſe books, or ever inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Chriſtians were miſtaken in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to whom they aſcribed them. Not one of them expreſſed an opinion upon this ſubject different from that which was held by Chriſtians. And when we conſider how much it would have availed them to have caſt a doubt upon this point, if they could; and how ready they ſhewed themſelves to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0270800301:315"/>
be, to take every advantage in their power; and that they were all men of learning and enquiry; their conceſſion, or rather their ſuffrage, upon the ſubject, is extremely valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe of Porphyry, it is made ſtill ſtronger, by the conſideration that he did in fact ſupport himſelf by this ſpecies of objection, when he ſaw any room for it, or when his acuteneſs could ſupply any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for alledging it. The prophecy of Daniel he attacked upon this very ground of ſpuriouſneſs, inſiſting that it was written after the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, and maintains his charge of forgery by ſome, far-fetched indeed, but very ſubtle criticiſms. Concerning the writings of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no trace of this ſuſpicion is anywhere to be ſound in him <note n="*" place="bottom">Michaelis's Introduction to the New Teſtament, vol. i. p. 43.

I. In the writings of Origen which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and in ſome extracts preſerved by Euſebius, from works of his which are now loſt, there are enumerations of the books of ſcripture, in which the four Goſpels and the Acts of the Apoſtles are diſtinctly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably ſpecified, and in which no books appear beſide what are now received <note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner's Cred. vol. iii. p. 234, et ſeq. vol. viii. p. 196.</note>.

                     <p n="2">II. Athanaſius, about a century after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, delivered a catalogue of the books of the New Teſtament in form, containing our ſcriptures and no others; of which he ſays, "In theſe alone the doctrine of religion is taught; let no man add to them, or take any thing from them <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. vol. viii. p. 223.</note>."</p>

                     <head type="sub">Theſe propoſitions cannot be predicated of any of thoſe books, which are commonly called apocryphal books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
                     <p>I Do not know that the objection taken from apocryphal writings is at preſent much relied upon by ſcholars. But there are many, who, hearing that various goſpels exiſted in ancient times under the names of the apoſtles, may have taken up a notion, that the ſelection of our preſent goſpels from the reſt, was rather an arbitrary or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal choice, than founded in any clear and certain cauſe of preference. To theſe it may be very uſeful to know the truth of the caſe. I obſerve therefore,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That, beſide our Goſpels and the Acts of the Apoſtles, no Chriſtian hiſtory, claiming
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0270800301:322"/>
to be written by an apoſtle or apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal man, is quoted within three hundred years after the birth of Chriſt, by any writer now extant, or known; or, if quoted, is not quoted with marks of cenſure and rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>I have not advanced this aſſertion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enquiry: and I doubt not, but that the paſſages cited by Mr. Jones and Dr. Lard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, under the ſeveral titles which the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal books bear; or a reference to the places where they are mentioned, as collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a very accurate table, publiſhed in the year 1773 by the Rev. J. Atkinſon; will make out the truth of the propoſition to the ſatisfaction of every fair and competent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If there be any book which may ſeem to form an exception to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is a Hebrew Goſpel, which was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated under the various titles of the Goſpel according to the Hebrews, the Goſpel of the Nazarenes, of the Ebionites, ſometimes call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Twelve, by ſome aſcribed to St. Matthew. This Goſpel is <hi>once,</hi> and only
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0270800301:323"/>
                        <hi>once,</hi> cited by Clement Alexandrinus, who lived, the reader will remember, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the ſecond century, and which ſame Clement quotes one or other of our four Goſpels in almoſt every page of his work. It is alſo twice mentioned by Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, A. D. 230; and both times with marks of diminution and diſcredit. And this is the ground upon which the exception ſtands. But what is ſtill more material to obſerve, is, that this Goſpel, in the main, agreed with our preſent Goſpel of St. Matthew <note n="*" place="bottom">In applying to this Goſpel, what Jerome in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the fourth century has mentioned of a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Goſpel, I think it probable that we ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found it with a Hebrew copy of St. Matthew's Goſpel, whether an original or verſion, which was then extant.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Now if, with this account of the apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Goſpels, we compare what we have read, concerning the canonical ſcriptures in the preceding ſections; or even recollect that general, but well-founded, aſſertion of Dr. Lardner's, "That in the remaining works of Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0270800301:324"/>
and Tertullian, who all lived in the two firſt centuries, there are more, and larger quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſmall volume of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than of all the works of Cicero, by writers of all characters, for ſeveral ages <note n="*" place="bottom">Lard. Cred. vol. xii. p. 53.</note>;" and if to this we add, that, notwithſtanding the loſs of many works of the primitive times of Chriſtianity, we have, within the above-mentioned period, the remains of Chriſtian writers, who lived in Paleſtine, Syria, Aſia Minor, Egypt, the part of Africa that uſed the Latin tongue, in Crete, Greece, Italy and Gaul, in all which remains, refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are found to our evangeliſts; I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that we ſhall perceive a clear and broad line of diviſion, between thoſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and all others pretending to a ſimilar authority.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. But beſide certain <hi>hiſtories</hi> which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the names of Apoſtles, and which were forgeries properly ſo called, there were ſome other Chriſtian writings, in the whole or in part of an hiſtorical nature, which,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0270800301:325"/>
though not forgeries, are denominated apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal, as being of uncertain, or of no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſecond claſs of writings I have found only two, which are noticed by any author of the three firſt centuries, without expreſs terms of condemnation; and theſe are, the one, a book entitled the Preaching of Peter, quoted repeatedly by Clement Alexandrinus, A. D. 196; the other, a book entitled the Revelation of Peter, upon which the above-mentioned Clement Alexandrinus is ſaid, by Euſebius, to have written notes; and which is twice cited in a work ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, aſcribed to the ſame author.</p>
                     <p>I conceive therefore, that the propoſition we have before advanced, even after it hath been ſubjected to every exception, of every kind, that can be alledged, ſeparates, by a wide interval, our hiſtorical ſcriptures, from all other writings which profeſs to give an account of the ſame ſubject.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0270800301:326"/>
We may be permitted however to add,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is no evidence, that any ſpurious or apocryphal books whatever, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted in the firſt century of the Chriſtan aera; in which century all our hiſtorical books are proved to have been extant. "There are no quotations of any ſuch books in the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical fathers, by whom I mean Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hermas, Ignatius and Polycarp, whoſe writings reach from about the year of our Lord 70, to the year 108;" (and ſome of whom have quoted each and every one of our hiſtorical ſcriptures) "I ſay this," adds Dr. Lardner, "becauſe I think it has been proved <note n="*" place="bottom">Ib. vol. xii. p. 158.</note>."</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe apocryphal writings were not read in the churches of Chriſtians;</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Were not admitted into their volume;</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Do not appear in their catalogues;</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0270800301:327"/>
5. Were not noticed by their adverſaries;</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Were not alledged by different parties, as of authority in their controverſies;</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Were not the ſubjects amongſt them, of commentaries, verſions, collations, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                     <p>Finally; beſide the ſilence of three cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, or evidence, within that time, of their rejection, they were, with a conſent nearly univerſal, reprobated by Chriſtian writers of ſucceeding ages.</p>
                     <p>Although it be made out by theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the books in queſtion never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any degree of credit and notoriety, which can place them in competition with our ſcriptures, yet it appears from the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the fourth century, that many ſuch exiſted in that century, and in the century preceding it. It may be difficult at this diſtance of time to account for their origin. Perhaps the moſt probable explication is,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0270800301:328"/>
that they were in general compoſed with a deſign of making a profit by the ſale. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever treated of the ſubject would find pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers. It was an advantage taken of the pious curioſity of unlearned Chriſtians. With a view to the ſame purpoſe, they were many of them adapted to the particular opinions of particular ſects, which would naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their circulation amongſt the favourers of thoſe opinions. After all, they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably much more obſcure than we imagine. Except the Goſpel according to the Hebrews, there is none, of which we hear more, than the Goſpel of the Egyptians; yet there is good reaſon to believe that Clement, a preſbyter of Alexandria in Egypt A. D. 184, and a man of almoſt univerſal reading, had never ſeen it <note n="*" place="bottom">Jones, vol. i. p. 243.</note>. A Goſpel according to Peter, was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the moſt ancient books of this kind; yet Serapion, biſhop of Antioch, A. D. 200, had not read it, when he heard of ſuch a book being in the hands of the Chriſtians of Rhoſſus in Cilicia; and ſpeaks of obtaining
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0270800301:329"/>
a ſight of this Goſpel from ſome ſectaries who uſed it <note n="†" place="bottom">Lard. Cred. vol. ii. p. 557.</note>. Even of the Goſpel of the Hebrews, which confeſſedly ſtands at the head of the catalogue, Jerome, at the end of the fourth century, was glad to procure a copy by the favour of the Nazareans of Berea. Nothing of this ſort ever happened, or could have happened, concerning our Goſpels.</p>
                     <p>One thing is obſervable of all the apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Chriſtian writings, viz. that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon the ſame fundamental hiſtory of Chriſt and his apoſtles, as that which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in our ſcriptures. The miſſion of Chriſt, his power of working miracles, his communication of that power to the apoſtles, his paſſion, death and reſurrection, are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed or aſſerted by every one of them. The names under which ſome of them came forth, are the names of men of eminence in our hiſtories. What theſe books give, are not contradictions, but unauthoriſed additions.

The principal facts are ſuppoſed, the principal agents the ſame; which ſhews that theſe points were too much fixed to be altered or diſputed.</p>
                     <p>If there be any book of this deſcription, which appears to have impoſed upon ſome conſiderable number of learned Chriſtians, it is the Sybilline oracles; but, when we reflect upon the circumſtances which facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated that impoſture, we ſhall ceaſe to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either at the attempt, or its ſucceſs.

                  <p>THE reader will now be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, that the two points which form the ſubject of our preſent diſcuſſion, are, firſt, that the founder of Chriſtianity, his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, and immediate followers, paſſed their lives in labours, dangers, and ſufferings; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they did ſo, in atteſtation of the miraculous hiſtory recorded in our ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſolely in conſequence of their belief of the truth of that hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The argument, by which theſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions have been maintained by us, ſtands thus:</p>
                  <p>No hiſtorical fact, I apprehend, is more certain, than that the original propagators of Chriſtianity voluntarily ſubjected themſelves to lives of fatigue, danger, and ſuffering, in the proſecution of their undertaking. The
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0270800301:339"/>
nature of the undertaking; the character of the perſons employed in it; the oppoſition of their tenets to the fixed opinions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the country, in which they firſt advanced them; their undiſſembled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the religion of all other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; their total want of power, authority, or force, render it in the higheſt degree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this muſt have been the caſe. The probability is increaſed, by what we know of the fate of the founder of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, who was put to death for his attempt; and by what we alſo know of the cruel treatment of the converts to the inſtitution, within thirty years after its commencement: both which points are atteſted by heathen writers, and being once admitted, leave it very incredible, that the primitive emiſſaries of the religion, who exerciſed their miniſtry, firſt, amongſt the people who had deſtroyed their maſter, and, afterwards, amongſt thoſe who perſecuted their converts, ſhould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eſcape with impunity, or purſue their purpoſe in eaſe and ſafety. This probability,

thus ſuſtained by foreign teſtimony, is advanced, I think, to hiſtorical certainty, by the evidence of our own books; by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of a writer, who was the companion of the perſons whoſe ſufferings he relates; by the letters of the perſons themſelves; by predictions of perſecutions aſcribed to the founder of the religion, which predictions would not have been inſerted in his hiſtory, much leſs have been ſtudiouſly dwelt upon, if they had not accorded with the event, and which, even if falſely aſcribed to him, could only have been ſo aſcribed, becauſe the event ſuggeſted them; laſtly, by inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant exhortations to fortitude and patience, and by an earneſtneſs, repetition, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency upon the ſubject, which were unlikely to have appeared, if there had not been, at the time, ſome extraordinary call for the exerciſe of theſe virtues.</p>
                  <p>It is made out alſo, I think, with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence, that both the teachers and converts of the religion, in conſequence of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0270800301:341"/>
their new profeſſion, took up a new courſe of life and behaviour.</p>
                  <p>The next great queſtion is, what they did this FOR. That it was <hi>for</hi> a miraculous ſtory of ſome kind or other, is to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion extremely manifeſt; becauſe, as to the fundamental article, the deſignation of the perſon, viz. that this particular perſon, Jeſus of Nazareth, ought to be received as the Meſſiah, or as a meſſenger from God, they neither had, nor could have, any thing but miracles to ſtand upon. That the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſufferings of the apoſtles were <hi>for</hi> the ſtory which we have now, is proved by the conſideration, that this ſtory is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us by two of their own number, and by two others perſonally connected with them; that the particularity of the narratives proves, that the writers claimed to poſſeſs circumſtantial information, that from their ſituation they had full opportunity of acquiring ſuch information, that they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, at leaſt, knew, what their colleagues,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0270800301:342"/>
their companions, their maſters taught; that each of theſe books contains enough to prove the truth of the religion; that, if any one of them therefore be genuine, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; that the genuineneſs however of all of them is made out, as well by the general arguments which evince the genuineneſs of the moſt undiſputed remains of antiquity, as alſo by peculiar and ſpecific proofs, viz. by citations from them in writings belonging to a period immediately contiguous to that in which they were publiſhed; by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed regard paid by early Chriſtians to the authority of theſe books, (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was manifeſted by their collecting of them into a volume, appropriating to that volume titles of peculiar reſpect, tranſlating them into various languages, digeſting them into harmonies, writing commentaries upon them, and, ſtill more conſpicuouſly, by the reading of them in their public aſſemblies in all parts of the world); by an univerſal agreement with reſpect to <hi>theſe</hi> books, whilſt doubts were entertained concerning ſome
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0270800301:343"/>
others; by contending ſects appealing to them; by the early adverſaries of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion not diſputing their genuineneſs, but, on the contrary, treating them as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitaries of the hiſtory upon which the religion was founded; by many formal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues of theſe, as of certain and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative writings, publiſhed in different and diſtant parts of the Chriſtian world; laſtly, by the abſence or defect of the above-cited topics of evidence, when applied to any other hiſtories of the ſame ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſtrong arguments to prove, that the books actually proceeded from the authors whoſe names they bear, (and have always borne, for there is not a particle of evidence to ſhew that they ever went under any other); but the ſtrict genuineneſs of the books is perhaps more than is neceſſary to the ſupport of our propoſition. For even ſuppoſing that, by reaſon of the ſilence of antiquity, or the loſs of records, we knew not who were the writers of the four Goſpels,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0270800301:344"/>
yet the fact, that they were received as authentic accounts of the tranſaction upon which the religion reſted, and were received as ſuch by Chriſtians at or near the age of the apoſtles, by thoſe whom the apoſtles had taught, and by ſocieties which the apoſtles had founded; this fact, I ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the conſideration, that they are corroborative of each other's teſtimony, and that they are further corroborated by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other contemporary hiſtory, taking up the ſtory where they had left it, and, in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative built upon that ſtory, accounting for the riſe and production of changes in the world, the effects of which ſubſiſt at this day; connected, moreover, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation which they receive, from letters written by the apoſtles themſelves, which both aſſume the ſame general ſtory, and, as often as occaſions lead them to do ſo, allude to particular parts of it; and connected alſo with the reflection, that if the apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered any different ſtory, it is loſt, (the preſent and no other being referred to by a
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0270800301:345"/>
ſeries of Chriſtian writers, down from their age to our own; being likewiſe recognized in a variety of inſtitutions, which prevailed, early and univerſally, amongſt the diſciples of the religion); and that ſo great a change, as the oblivion of one ſtory and the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of another, under ſuch circumſtances, could not have taken place; this evidence would be deemed, I apprehend, ſufficient to prove concerning theſe books, that, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were the authors of them, they exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the ſtory which the apoſtles told, and for which, conſequently, they acted, and they ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſo, the religion muſt be true. Theſe men could not be deceivers. By only not bearing teſtimony, they might have avoided all their ſufferings, and have lived quietly. Would men in ſuch circumſtances pretend to have ſeen what they never ſaw; aſſert facts which they had no knowledge of; go about lying, to teach virtue; and, though not only convinced of Chriſt's being
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0270800301:346"/>
an impoſtor, but having ſeen the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his impoſture in his crucifixion, yet perſiſt in carrying it on; and ſo perſiſt, as to bring upon themſelves, for nothing, and with a full knowledge of the conſequence, enmity and hatred, danger and death?</p>

                  <p>I ENTER upon this part of my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by declaring how far my belief in miraculous accounts goes. If the reformers in the time of Wickliff, or of Luther; or thoſe of England, in the time of Henry the Eighth, or of Queen Mary; or the founders of our religious fects ſince, ſuch as were Mr. Whitfield and Mr. Weſley in our own times; had undergone the life of toil and exertion, of danger and ſufferings, which we know that many of them did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, <hi>for</hi> a miraculous ſtory; that is to ſay, if they had founded their public miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try upon the allegation of miracles wrought within their own knowledge, and upon narratives
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0270800301:349"/>
which could not be reſolved into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion or miſtake; and iſ it had appeared, that their conduct really had its origin in theſe accounts, I ſhould have believed them. Or, to borrow an inſtance which will be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to every one of my readers, if the late Mr. Howard had undertaken his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and journies in atteſtation, and in conſequence of a clear and ſenſible miracle, I ſhould have believed him alſo. Or, to repreſent the ſame thing under a third ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; if Socrates had profeſſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form public miracles at Athens; if the friends of Socrates, Phaedo, Cebes, Crito, and Simmias, together with Plato, and many of his followers, relying upon the atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which theſe miracles afforded to his pretenſions, had, at the hazard of their lives, and the certain expence of their eaſe and tranquillity, gone about Greece, after his death, to publiſh and propagate his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines; and if theſe things had come to our knowledge, in the ſame way as that in which the life of Socrates is now tranſmitted to us, through the hands of his companions
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0270800301:350"/>
and diſciples, that is, by writings received without doubt as theirs, from the age in which they were publiſhed to the preſent, I ſhould have believed this likewiſe. And my belief would, in each caſe, be much ſtrengthened, if the ſubject of the miſſion were of importance to the conduct and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of human life; if it teſtified any thing which it behoved mankind to know from ſuch authority; if the nature of what it delivered, required the ſort of proof which it alledged; if the occaſion was adequate to the interpoſition, the end worthy of the means. In the laſt caſe my faith would be much confirmed, if the effects of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action <hi>remained;</hi> more eſpecially, if a change had been wrought, at the time, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and conduct of ſuch numbers, as to lay the foundation of an inſtitution, and of a ſyſtem of doctrines, which had ſince overſpread the greateſt part of the civilized world. I ſhould have believed, I ſay, the teſtimony, in theſe caſes; yet none of them do more than come up to the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic hiſtory.</p>

                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0270800301:351"/>
If any one chooſe to call aſſent to this evidence credulity, it is at leaſt incumbent upon him to produce examples, in which the ſame evidence hath turned out to be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious. And this contains the preciſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which we are now to agitate.</p>
                  <p>In ſtating the compariſon between our evidence, and what our adverſaries may bring into competition with ours, we will divide the diſtinctions which we wiſh to propoſe into two kinds, thoſe which relate to the proof, and thoſe which relate to the miracles. Under the former head we may lay out of the caſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Such accounts of ſupernatural events as are found only in hiſtories by ſome ages poſterior to the tranſaction, and of which it is evident that the hiſtorian could know little more than his reader. Ours is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary hiſtory. This difference alone removes out of our way, the miraculous hiſtory of Pythagoras, who lived five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before the Chriſtian aera, written by Porphyry and Jamblicus, who lived
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0270800301:352"/>
three hundred years after that aera; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of Livy's hiſtory; the fables of the heroic ages; the whole of the Greek and Roman, as well as of the Gothic mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; a great part of the legendary hiſtory of Popiſh ſaints, the very beſt atteſted of which is extracted from the certificates that are exhibited during the proceſs of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization, a ceremony which ſeldom takes place till a century after their deaths. It applies alſo with conſiderable force to the miracles of Apollonius Tyaneus, which are contained in a ſolitary hiſtory of his life, publiſhed by Philoſtratus, above a hundred years after his death; and, in which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſtratus had any prior account to guide him, depends upon his ſingle unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported aſſertion. Alſo to ſome of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the third century, eſpecially to one extraordinary inſtance, the account of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, biſhop of Neoceſarea, called Thauma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgus, delivered in the writings of Gregory of Nyſſen, who lived one hundred and thirty years after the ſubject of his panegyric.</p>

The value of this circumſtance is ſhewn to have been accurately exempliſied in the hiſtory of Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the order of Jeſuits <note n="*" place="bottom">Douglaſs's Criterion of Miracles, p. 74.</note>. His life, written by a companion of his, and by one of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was publiſhed about fifteen years after his death. In which life, the author, ſo far from aſcribing any miracles to Ignatius, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſtates the reaſons why he was not inveſted with any ſuch power. The life was re-publiſhed fifteen years afterwards, with the addition of many circumſtances, which were the fruit, the author ſays, of further enquiry, and of diligent examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ſtill with a total ſilence about mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. When Ignatius had been dead near ſixty years, the Jeſuits, conceiving a wiſh to have the founder of their order placed in the Roman calendar, began, as it ſhould ſeem, for the firſt time, to attribute to him a catalogue of miracles, which could not then be diſtinctly diſproved; and which, there was in thoſe who governed the church, a ſtrong diſpoſition to admit upon the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt proofs.</p>

II. We may lay out of the caſe, accounts publiſhed in one country, of what paſſed in a diſtant country, without any proof that ſuch accounts were known or received at home. In the caſe of Chriſtianity, Judea, which was the ſcene of the tranſaction, was the center of the miſſion. The ſtory was publiſhed in the place in which it was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The church of Chriſt was firſt planted at Jeruſalem itſelf. With that church others correſponded. From thence the primitive teachers of the inſtitution went forth; thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they aſſembled. The church of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and the ſeveral churches of Judea, ſubſiſted from the beginning, and for many ages <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſucceſſion of many eminent biſhops of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, in the three firſt centuries, is diſtinctly preſerved, as Alexander, A. D. 212, who ſucceeded Narciſſus, then 116 years old.</note>; received alſo the ſame books, and the ſame accounts, as other churches did.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction diſpoſes, amongſt others, of the above-mentioned miracles of Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Tyaneus, moſt of which are related to have been performed in India, no evidence remaining that either the miracles aſcribed
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0270800301:355"/>
to him, or the hiſtory of thoſe miracles, were ever heard of in India. Thoſe of Francis Xavier, the Indian miſſionary, with many others of the Romiſh breviary, are liable to the ſame objection, viz. that the accounts of them were publiſhed at a vaſt diſtance from the ſuppoſed ſcene of the wonders <note n="*" place="bottom">Doug. Crit. p. 84.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. We lay out of the caſe <hi>tranſient</hi> rumours. Upon the firſt publication of an extraordinary account, or even of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of ordinary intelligence, no one, who is not perſonally acquainted with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, can know whether it be true or falſe, becauſe any man may publiſh any ſtory. It is in the future confirmation, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the account; in its permanency, or its diſappearance; its dying away into ſilence, or its increaſing in notoriety; its being followed up by ſubſequent accounts, and being repeated in different and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent accounts, that ſolid truth is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from fugitive lies. This diſtinction
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0270800301:356"/>
is altogether on the ſide of Chriſtianity. The ſtory did not drop. On the contrary, it was ſucceeded by a train of action and events dependent upon it. The accounts, which we have in our hands, were compoſed after the firſt reports muſt have ſubſided. They were followed by a train of writings upon the ſubject. The hiſtorical teſtimonies of the tranſaction were many and various, and connected with letters, diſcourſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, apologies, ſucceſſively produced by the ſame tranſaction.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. We may lay out of the caſe what I call <hi>naked</hi> hiſtory. It has been ſaid, that if the prodigies of the Jewiſh hiſtory had been found only in fragments of Manetho, or Beroſus, we ſhould have paid no regard to them: and I am willing to admit this. If we knew nothing of the fact, but from the fragment; if we poſſeſſed no proof that theſe accounts had been credited and acted upon, from times, probably, as ancient as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts themſelves; if we had no viſible effects connected with the hiſtory, no ſubſequent
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0270800301:357"/>
or collateral teſtimony to confirm it; under theſe circumſtances, I think that it would be undeſerving of credit. But this certainly is not our caſe. In appreciating the evidence of Chriſtianity, the books are to be combined with the inſtitution; with the prevalency of the religion at this day; with the time and place of its origin, which are acknowledged points; with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of its riſe and progreſs, as collected from external hiſtory; with the fact of our preſent books being received by the votaries of the inſtitution from the beginning; with that of other books coming after theſe, filled with accounts of effects and conſequences reſulting from the tranſaction, or referring to the tranſaction, or built upon it; laſtly, with the conſideration of the number and variety of the books themſelves, the different writers from which they proceed, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent views with which they were written, ſo diſagreeing as to repel the ſuſpicion of confederacy, ſo agreeing as to ſhew that they were founded in a common original, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a ſtory ſubſtantially the ſame. Whether
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0270800301:358"/>
this proof be ſatisfactory or not, it is properly a cumulation of evidence, by no means a naked or ſolitary record.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. A mark of hiſtorical truth, although only in a certain way, and to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, is <hi>particularity,</hi> in names, dates, places, circumſtances, and in the order of events preceding or following the tranſaction: of which kind, for inſtance, is the particularity in the deſcription of St. Paul's voyage and ſhipwreck, in the 27th chapter of the Acts, which no man, I think, can read without being convinced that the writer was there; and alſo in the account of the cure and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the blind man, in the ninth chapter of St. John's Goſpel, which bears every mark of perſonal knowledge on the part of the hiſtorian <note n="*" place="bottom">Both theſe chapters ought to be read for the ſake of this very obſervation.</note>. I do not deny that fiction has often the particularity of truth; but then it is of ſtudied and elaborate fiction, or of a formal attempt to deceive, that we obſerve this. Since, however, experience
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0270800301:359"/>
proves that particularity is not conſined to truth, I have ſtated that it is a proof of truth only to a certain extent, <hi>i. e.</hi> it reduces the queſtion to this, whether we can depend or not upon the <hi>probity</hi> of the relator; which is a conſiderable advance in our preſent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for an expreſs attempt to deceive, in which caſe alone particularity can appear without truth, is charged upon the evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts by few. If the hiſtorian acknowledge himſelf to have received his intelligence from others, the particularity of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſhews, primâ facie, the accuracy of his enquiries, and the fulneſs of his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This remark belongs to St. Luke's hiſtory. Of the particularity which we alledge many examples may be found in all the Goſpels. And it is very difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that ſuch numerous particularities, as are almoſt every where to be met with in the ſcriptures, ſhould be raiſed out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or be ſpun out of the imagination without any fact to go upon <note n="*" place="bottom">"There is always ſome truth where there are conſiderable particularities related; and they always ſeem to bear ſome proportion to one another. Thus there is a great want of the particulars, of time, place, and perſons, in Manetho's account of the Egyptian Dynaſties, Eteſias's of the Aſſyrian Kings, and thoſe which the technical chronologers have given of the ancient kingdoms of Greece; and agreeably thereto, theſe accounts have much fiction and falſehood, with ſome truth: whereas Thucydides's Hiſtory of the Peloponneſian War, and Ceſar's of the War in Gaul, in both which the particulars of time, place, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are mentioned, are univerſally eſteemed true to a great degree of exactneſs." Hartley, vol. ii. p. 109.</note>.</p>

                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:0270800301:360"/>
It is to be remarked, however, that this particularity is only to be looked for in direct hiſtory. It is not natural in references or alluſions, which yet, in other reſpects, often afford, as far as they go, the moſt unſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious evidence.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. We lay out of the caſe ſuch ſtories of ſupernatural events, as require, on the part of the hearer, nothing more than an <hi>otioſe</hi> aſſent; ſtories upon which nothing depends, in which no intereſt is involved, nothing is to be done or changed in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of believing them. Such ſtories are
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0270800301:361"/>
credited, if the careleſs aſſent that is given to them deſerve that name, more by the indolence of the hearer, than by his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or, though not much credited, are paſſed from one to another without enquiry or reſiſtance. To this caſe, and to this caſe alone, belongs what is called the love of the marvellous. I have never known it carry men further. Men do not ſuffer perſecution from the love of the marvellous. Of the indifferent nature we are ſpeaking of, are moſt vulgar errors and popular ſuperſtitions; moſt, for inſtance, of the current reports of apparitions. Nothing depends upon their being true or falſe. But not, ſurely, of this kind were the alledged miracles of Chriſt and his apoſtles. They decided, if true, the moſt important queſtion, upon which the human mind can ſix its anxiety. They claimed to regulate the opinions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, upon ſubjects in which they are not only deeply concerned, but uſually refractory and obſtinate. Men could not be utterly careleſs in ſuch a caſe as this. If a Jew took up the ſtory, he found his darling partiality
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0270800301:362"/>
to his own nation and law wounded; if a Gentile, he found his idolatry and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheiſm reprobated and condemned. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever entertained the account, whether Jew or Gentile, could not avoid the following reflection:—"If theſe things be true, I muſt give up the opinions and principles in which I have been brought up, the religion in which my fathers lived and died." It is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable that a man ſhould do this upon any idle report or frivolous account, or, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, without being fully ſatisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth and credibility of the narrative to which he truſted. But it did not ſtop at opinions. They who believed Chriſtianity, acted upon it. Many made it the expreſs buſineſs of their lives to publiſh the intelligence. It was required of thoſe, who admitted that intelligence, to change forthwith their conduct and their principles, to take up a different courſe of life, to part with their habits and gratifications, and begin a new ſet of rules and ſyſtem of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. The apoſtles, at leaſt, were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted not to ſacrifice their eaſe, their fortunes,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0270800301:363"/>
and their lives, for an idle tale; multitudes beſide them were induced, by the ſame tale, to encounter oppoſition, danger, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, that the mere promiſe of a future ſtate would do all this; I anſwer, that the mere promiſe of a future ſtate, without any evidence to give credit or aſſurance to it, would do nothing. A few wandering fiſhermen talking of a reſurrection of the dead could produce no effect. If it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, that men eaſily believe what they anxiouſly deſire, I again anſwer that, in my opinion, the very contrary of this is nearer to the truth. Anxiety of deſire, earneſtneſs of expectation, the vaſtneſs of an event, rather cauſes men to diſbelieve, to doubt, to dread a fallacy, to diſtruſt, and to examine. When our Lord's reſurrection was firſt reported to the apoſtles, they did not believe, we are told, for joy. This was natural, and is agreeable to experience.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. We have laid out of the caſe thoſe
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0270800301:364"/>
accounts, which require no more than a ſimple aſſent; and we now alſo lay out of the caſe thoſe which come merely <hi>in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of opinions already formed. This laſt circumſtance is of the utmoſt importance to notice well. It has long been obſerved, that Popiſh miracles happen in Popiſh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; that they make no converts: which proves that ſtories are accepted, when they fall in with principles already fixed, with the public ſentiments, or with the ſentiments of a party already engaged on the ſide the miracle ſupports, which would not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be produced in the face of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in oppoſition to reigning tenets or favourite prejudices, or when, if they be believed, the belief muſt draw men away from their preconceived and habitual opinions, from their modes of life and rules of action. In the former caſe, men may not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a miraculous account, but may both act and ſuffer on the ſide, and in the cauſe, which the miracle ſupports, yet not act or ſuffer <hi>for</hi> the miracle, but in purſuance of a prior perſuaſion. The miracle, like any other
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0270800301:365"/>
argument which only confirms what was before believed, is admitted with little exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. In the moral, as in the natural world, it is <hi>change</hi> which requires a cauſe. Men are eaſily fortified in their old opinions, driven from them with great difficulty. Now, how does this apply to the Chriſtian hiſtory? The miracles, there recorded, were wrought in the midſt of enemies, under a government, a prieſthood, and a magiſtracy, decidedly and vehemently adverſe to them, and to the pretenſions which they ſupported. They were Proteſtant miracles in a Popiſh country: they were Popiſh miracles in the midſt of Proteſtants. They produced a change; they eſtabliſhed a ſociety upon the ſpot, adhering to the belief of them; they made converts, and thoſe who were converted, gave up to the teſtimony, their moſt fixed opinions, and moſt favourite prejudices. They who acted and ſuffered in the cauſe, acted and ſuffered <hi>for</hi> the miracles; for there was no anterior perſuaſion to induce them, no prior reverence, prejudice, or partiality, to take hold of. Jeſus had not one follower when
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0270800301:366"/>
he ſet up his claim. His miracles gave birth to his ſect. No part of this deſcription belongs to the ordinary evidence of Heathen or Popiſh miracles. Even moſt of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles alledged to have been performed by Chriſtians, in the ſecond and third century of its aera, want this confirmation. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes indeed a line of partition between the <hi>origin</hi> and the <hi>progreſs</hi> of Chriſtianity. Frauds and fallacies might mix themſelves with the progreſs, which could not poſſibly take place in the commencement of the religion; at leaſt according to any laws of human conduct that we are acquainted with. What ſhould ſuggeſt to the firſt propagators of Chriſtianity, eſpecially to fiſhermen, tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers, and huſbandmen, ſuch a thought as that of changing the religion of the world; what could bear them through the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which the attempt engaged them; what could procure any degree of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the attempt; are queſtions which apply, with great force, to the ſetting out of the inſtitution, with leſs, to every future ſtage of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0270800301:367"/>
To hear ſome men talk, one would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſetting up of a religion by miracles to be a thing of every day's experience; whereas the whole current of hiſtory is againſt it. Hath any founder of a new ſect amongſt Chriſtians pretended to miraculous powers, and ſucceeded by his pretenſions? "Were theſe powers claimed or exerciſed by the founders of the ſects of the Waldenſes and Albigenſes? Did Wickliff in England pretend to it? Did Huſs or Jerome in Bohemia? Did Luther in Germany, Zuinglius in Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, Calvin in France, or any of the reformers advance this plea <note n="*" place="bottom">Campbell on Miracles, p. 120, ed. 1766.</note>?" The French prophets, in the beginning of the preſent century, ventured to alledge miraculous evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and immediately ruined their cauſe by their temerity. "Concerning the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Ancient Rome, of Turkey, of Siam, of China, a ſingle miracle cannot be named, that was ever offered as a teſt of any of thoſe religions <hi>before</hi> their eſtabliſhment <note n="†" place="bottom">Adams on Mir. p. 75.</note>."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0270800301:368"/>
We may add to what has been obſerved, of the diſtinction which we are conſidering, that, where miracles are alledged merely in affirmance of a prior opinion, they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the doctrine may ſometimes propagate a belief of the miracles which they do not themſelves entertain. This is the caſe of what are called <hi>pious</hi> frauds; but it is a caſe, I apprehend, which takes place, ſolely in ſupport of a perſuaſion already eſtabliſhed. At leaſt it does not hold of the apoſtolical hiſtory. If the apoſtles did not believe the miracles, they did not believe the religion; and, without this belief, where was the <hi>piety,</hi> what place was there for any thing, which could bear the name or colour of piety, in publiſhing and atteſting miracles in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half? If it be ſaid that many promote the belief of revelation, and of any accounts which favour that belief, becauſe they think them, whether well or ill founded, of public and political utility, I anſwer, that if a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter exiſt, which can with leſs juſtice than another be aſcribed to the founders of the Chriſtian religion, it is that of politicians, or
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0270800301:369"/>
of men capable of entertaining political views. The truth is, that there is no aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able character, which will account for the conduct of the apoſtles, ſuppoſing their ſtory to be falſe. If bad men, what could have induced them to take ſuch pains to promote virtue? If good men, they would not have gone about the country with a ſtring of lies in their mouths?</p>
                  <p>IN APPRECIATING the credit of any miraculous ſtory, theſe are diſtinctions which relate to the evidence. There are other diſtinctions, of great moment in the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which relate to the miracles themſelves. Of which latter kind the following ought carefully to be retained.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It is not neceſſary to admit as a miracle, what can be reſolved into a <hi>falſe perception.</hi> Of this nature was the demon of Socrates; the viſions of St. Anthony, and of many others; the viſion which Lord Herbert of Cherbury deſcribes himſelf to have ſeen; Colonel Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner's viſion, as related in his life, written
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0270800301:370"/>
by Dr. Doddridge. All theſe may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for by a momentary inſanity; for the characteriſtic ſymptom of human mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the riſing up in the mind of images not diſtinguiſhable by the patient from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon the ſenſes <note n="*" place="bottom">Batty on Lunacy.</note>. The caſes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in which the poſſibility of this deluſion exiſts, are divided from the caſes in which it does not exiſt, by many, and thoſe not obſcure marks. They are, for the moſt part, caſes of viſions or voices. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is hardly ever touched. The viſion ſubmits not to be handled. One ſenſe does not confirm another. They are likewiſe almoſt always caſes of a <hi>ſolitary</hi> witneſs. It is in the higheſt degree improbable, and I know not, indeed, whether it hath ever been the fact, that the ſame derangement of the mental organs ſhould ſeize different perſons at the ſame time; a derangement, I mean, ſo much the ſame, as to repreſent to their imagination the ſame objects. Laſtly, theſe are always caſes of <hi>momentary</hi> miracles;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0270800301:371"/>
by which term I mean to denote miracles, of which the whole exiſtence is of ſhort duration, in contradiſtinction to miracles which are attended with permanent effects. The appearance of a ſpectre, the hearing of a ſupernatural ſound, is a momentary mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. The ſenſible proof is gone, when the apparition or ſound is over. But if a perſon born blind be reſtored to ſight, a notorious cripple to the uſe of his limbs, or a dead man to life, here is a permanent effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſupernatural means. The change indeed was inſtantaneous, but the proof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. The ſubject of the miracle remains. The man cured or reſtored is there: his former condition was known, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition may be examined. This can by no poſſibility be reſolved into falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: and of this kind are by far the greater part of the miracles recorded in the New Teſtament. When Lazarus was raiſed from the dead, he did not merely move, and ſpeak, and die again; or come out of the grave, and vaniſh away. He returned to his home and his family, and there continued;
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0270800301:372"/>
for we find him, ſome time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the ſame town, ſitting at table with Jeſus and his ſiſters; viſited by great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the Jews, as a ſubject of curioſity; giving, by his preſence, ſo much uneaſineſs to the Jewiſh rulers, as to beget in them a deſign of deſtroying him <note n="*" place="bottom">John xii. 1, 2. 9, 10.</note>. No deluſion can account for this. The French prophets in England, ſome time ſince, gave out that one of their teachers would come to life again, but their enthuſiaſm never made them believe that they actually ſaw him alive. The blind man, whoſe reſtoration to ſight at Jeruſalem is recorded in the ninth chapter of St. John's goſpel, did not quit the place, or conceal himſelf from enquiry. On the contrary, he was forthcoming, to anſwer the call, to ſatisfy the ſcrutiny, and to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the brow-beating of Chriſt's angry and powerful enemies. When the cripple at the gate of the temple was ſuddenly cured by Peter <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts iii. 2.</note>, he did not immediately relapſe into his former lameneſs, or diſappear out of the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0270800301:373"/>
city; but boldly and honeſtly produced himſelf along with the apoſtles, when they were brought the next day before the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh council <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts iv. 14.</note>. Here, though the miracle was ſudden, the proof was permanent. The lameneſs had been notorious, the cure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. This, therefore, could not be the effect of any momentary delirium, either in the ſubject or in the witneſſes of the tranſaction. It is the ſame with the greateſt number of the ſcripture miracles. There are other caſes of a <hi>mixed</hi> nature, in which, although the principal miracle be momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, ſome circumſtance combined with it is permanent. Of this kind is the hiſtory of St. Paul's converſion <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. ix.</note>. The ſudden light and ſound, the viſion and the voice, upon the road to Damaſcus, were momentary: but Paul's blindneſs for three days in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of what had happened; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication made to Ananias in another place, and by a viſion independent of the former; Ananias finding out Paul in conſequence
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0270800301:374"/>
of intelligence ſo received, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the condition deſcribed, and Paul's recovery of his ſight upon Ananias laying his hands upon him; are circumſtances, which take the tranſaction, and the principal miracle as included in it, entirely out of the caſe of momentary miracles, or of ſuch as may be accounted for by falſe perceptions. Exactly the ſame thing may be obſerved of Peter's viſion preparatory to the call of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, and of its connection with what was imparted in a diſtant place to Cornelius him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and with the meſſage diſpatched by Cornelius to Peter. The viſion might be a dream; the meſſage could not. Either communication, taken ſeparately, might be a deluſion; the concurrence of the two was impoſſible to happen without a ſupernatural cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Beſide the riſk of deluſion, which attaches upon momentary miracles, there is alſo much more room for <hi>impoſture.</hi> The account can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be examined at the moment. And, when that is alſo a moment of hurry and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0270800301:375"/>
confuſion, it may not be difficult for men of influence to gain credit to any ſtory, which they may wiſh to have believed. This is preciſely the caſe of one of the beſt atteſted of the miracles of old Rome, the appearance of Caſtor and Pollux in the battle fought by Poſthumius with the Latins at the lake Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillus. There is no doubt but that Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, after the battle, ſpread the report of ſuch an appearance. No perſon could deny it, whilſt it was ſaid to laſt. No perſon, perhaps, had any inclination to diſpute it afterwards; or, if they had, could ſay with poſitiveneſs, what was, or what was not ſeen, by ſome or other of the army, in the diſmay, and amidſt the tumult of a battle.</p>
                  <p>In aſſigning falſe perceptions, as the origin to which ſome miraculous accounts may be referred, I have not mentioned claims to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, illuminations, ſecret notices or directions, internal ſenſations, or conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of being acted upon by ſpiritual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, good or bad, becauſe, theſe appealing to no external proof, however convincing
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0270800301:376"/>
they may be to the perſons themſelves, form no part of what can be accounted miraculous evidence. Their own credibility ſtands upon their alliance with other miracles. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, therefore, of all ſuch pretenſions may be omitted.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is not neceſſary to bring into the compariſon what may be called <hi>tentative</hi> miracles; that is, where, out of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of trials, ſome ſucceed; and in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of which, although the narrative of the ſucceſsful caſes be alone preſerved, and that of the unſucceſsful caſes ſunk, yet enough is ſtated to ſhew that the caſes produced are only a few out of many in which the ſame means have been employed. This obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bears, with conſiderable force, upon the ancient oracles and auguries, in which a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle coincidence of the event with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is talked of and magnified, whilſt failures are forgotten, or ſuppreſſed, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. It is alſo applicable to the cures wrought by relies, and at the tombs of faints. The boaſted eſſicacy of the king's
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0270800301:377"/>
touch, upon which Mr. Hume lays ſome ſtreſs, falls under the ſame deſcription. Nothing is alledged concerning it, which is not alledged of various noſtrums, namely, out of many thouſands who have uſed them, certified proofs of a few who have recovered after them. No ſolution of this ſort is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the miracles of the goſpel. There is nothing in the narrative which can induce, or even allow, us to believe, that Chriſt attempted cures in many inſtances, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in a few; or that he ever made the attempt in vain. He did not profeſs to heal every where all that were ſick; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he told the Jews, evidently meaning to repreſent his own caſe, that, "although many widows were in Iſrael in the days of Elias, when the heaven was ſhut up three years and ſix months, when great famine was throughout all the land, yet unto none of them was Elias ſent, ſave unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow:" and that "many lepers were in Iſrael in the time of Eliſeus the prophet, and none of them was cleanſed ſaving Naaman
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0270800301:378"/>
the Syrian <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke iv. 25.</note>." By which examples he gave them to underſtand, that it was not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a divine interpoſition, or neceſſary to its purpoſe, to be general; ſtill leſs, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer every challenge that might be made, which would teach men to put their faith upon theſe experiments. Chriſt never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the word, but the effect followed <note n="†" place="bottom">One, and only one, inſtance may be produced in which the <hi>diſciples</hi> of Chriſt do ſeem to have attempted a cure, and not to have been able to perform it. The ſtory is very ingenuouſly related by three of the evangeliſts <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                           <p>Mark. ix. 14.</p> 
                           <p>Mat. xvi. 20.</p>
                        </note>. The patient was afterwards healed by Chriſt himſelf; and the whole tranſaction ſeems to have been intended, as it was well ſuited, to diſplay the ſuperiority of Chriſt above all who performed miracles in his name; a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction which, during his preſence in the world, it might be neceſſary to inculcate by ſome ſuch proof as this.</note>. It was not a thouſand ſick that received his benediction, and a few that were benefited: a ſingle paralytic is let down in his bed at Jeſus' feet, in the midſt of a ſurrounding multitude; Jeſus bid him walk, and he did
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0270800301:379"/>
ſo <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark ii. 3.</note>. A man with a withered hand is in the ſynagogue; Jeſus bid him ſtretch forth his hand, in the preſence of the aſſembly, and it was "reſtored whole like the other <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xii. 10.</note>." There was nothing tentative in theſe cures; nothing that can be explained by the power of accident.</p>
                  <p>We may obſerve alſo, that many of the cures which Chriſt wrought, ſuch as that of a perſon blind from his birth, alſo many miracles beſide cures, as raiſing the dead, walking upon the ſea, feeding a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude with a few loaves and fiſhes, are of a nature which does not in any wife admit of the ſuppoſition of a fortunate experiment.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. We may diſmiſs from the queſtion all accounts in which, allowing the pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon to be real, the fact to be true, it ſtill remains <hi>doubtful</hi> whether a miracle were wrought. This is the caſe with the ancient hiſtory of what is called the thundering
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0270800301:380"/>
legion, of the extraordinary circumſtances which obſtructed the rebuilding of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Jeruſalem by Julian, the circling of the flames and fragrant ſmell at the martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Polycarp, the ſudden ſhower that extinguiſhed the fire into which the ſcriptures were thrown in the Diocletian perſecution; Conſtantine's dream, his inſcribing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it the croſs upon his ſtandard and the ſhields of his ſoldiers; his victory, and the eſcape of the ſtandard bearer; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alſo the imagined appearance of the croſs in the heavens, though this laſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is very deficient in hiſtorical evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It is alſo the caſe with the modern annual exhibition of the liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius at Naples. It is a doubt likewiſe, which ought to be excluded by very ſpecial circumſtances, from theſe narratives which relate to the ſupernatural cure of hypochondriacal and nervous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and of all diſeaſes which are much affected by the imagination. The miracles of the ſecond and third century are, uſually, healing the ſick, and caſting out evil ſpirits,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0270800301:381"/>
miracles in which there is room for ſome error and deception. We hear nothing of cauſing the blind to ſee, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the lepers to be cleanſed <note n="*" place="bottom">Jortin's Remarks, vol. ii. p. 51.</note>. There are alſo inſtances in Chriſtian-writers, of reputed miracles, which were natural operations, though not known to be ſuch at the time, as that of articulate ſpeech after the loſs of a great part of the tongue.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. To the ſame head of objection nearly, may alſo be referred accounts, in which the variation of a ſmall circumſtance may have transformed ſome extraordinary appearance, or ſome critical coincidence of events, into a miracle; ſtories, in a word, which may be reſolved into exaggeration. The miracles of the goſpel can by no poſſibility be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained away in this manner. Total fiction will account for any thing; but no ſtretch of exaggeration that has any parallel in other hiſtories, no force of fancy upon real cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, could produce the narratives which we now have. The feeding of the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0270800301:382"/>
five thouſand with a few loaves and fiſhes ſurpaſſes all bounds of exaggeration. The raiſing of Lazarus, of the widow's ſon at Nain, as well as many of the cures which Chriſt wrought, come not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of miſrepreſentation. I mean, that it is impoſſible to aſſign any poſition of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances however peculiar, any accidental ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects however extraordinary, any natural ſingularity, which could ſupply an origin or foundation to theſe accounts.</p>
                  <p>Having thus enumerated ſeveral excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may juſtly be taken to relations of miracles, it is neceſſary, when we read the ſcriptures, to bear in our minds this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral remark, that, although there be mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles recorded in the New Teſtament, which fall within ſome or other of the exceptions here aſſigned, yet that they are united with others, to which none of the ſame exceptions extend, and that their credibility ſtands upon this union. Thus the viſions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, which St. Paul aſſerts to have been imparted to him, may not, in their ſeparate evidence, be diſtinguiſhable from the viſions
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0270800301:383"/>
and revelations which many others have alledged. But here is the difference. St. Paul's pretenſions were atteſted by external miracles wrought by himſelf, and by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought in the cauſe to which theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions relate; or, to ſpeak more properly, the ſame hiſtorical authority, which informs us of one, informs us of the other. This is not ordinarily true of the viſions of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, or even of the accounts in which they are contained. Again, ſome of Chriſt's own miracles were <hi>momentary;</hi> as the transfiguration, the appearance and voice from Heaven at his baptiſm, a voice from the clouds upon one occaſion afterwards, (John xii. 30.) and ſome others. It is not denied, that the diſtinction which we have propoſed concerning miracles of this ſpecies, applies, in diminution of the force of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as much to theſe inſtances as to others. But this is the caſe, not with all the miracles aſcribed to Chriſt, nor with the greateſt part, nor with many. Whatever force therefore there may be in the objection, we have numerous miracles which are free
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0270800301:384"/>
from it; and even theſe to which it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, are little affected by it in their credit, becauſe there are few, who, admitting the reſt, will reject <hi>them.</hi> If there be miracles of the New Teſtament, which come within any of the <hi>other</hi> heads into which we have diſtributed the objections, the ſame remark muſt be repeated. And this is one way, in which the unexampled number and variety of the miracles aſcribed to Chriſt, ſtrengthens the credibility of Chriſtianity. For it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes any ſolution, or conjecture about a ſolution, which imagination, or even which experience might ſuggeſt concerning ſome particular miracles, if conſidered independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of others. The miracles of Chriſt were of various kinds <note n="*" place="bottom">Not only healing every ſpecies of diſeaſe, but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water into wine (John ii.); feeding multitudes with a few loaves and fiſhes (Mat. xiv. 14. Mark vi. 35. Luke ix. 12. John iv. 5.); walking on the ſea (Mat. xiv. 23.); calming a ſtorm (Mat. viii. 26. Luke viii. 23.); a celeſtial voice at his baptiſm, and miraculous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (Mat. iii. 17. afterwards John xii. 28.); his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration (Mat. xvii. 1—8. Mark ix. 2. Luke ix. 28. 2 Ep Peter i. 16, 17.); raiſing the dead in three diſtinct inſtances (Mat. ix. 18. Mark v. 22. Luke viii. 41. Luke vii. 14. John xi.).</note>, and performed in great varieties of ſituation, form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; at Jeruſalem, the metropolis of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nation and religion; in different parts of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0270800301:385"/>
Judea and Galilee; in cities, in villages; in ſynagogues, in private houſes; in the ſtreet, in highways; with preparation, as in the caſe of Lazarus, by accident, as in the caſe of the widow's ſon at Nain; when attended by multitudes, and when alone with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; in the midſt of his diſciples, and in the preſence of his enemies; with the common people around him, and before Scribes and Phariſees, and rulers of the ſynagogues.</p>
                  <p>I apprehend that, when we remove from the compariſon, the caſes which are fairly diſpoſed of by the obſervations that have been ſtated, many caſes will not remain. To thoſe which do remain, we apply this final diſtinction; "that there is not ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory evidence, that perſons, pretending to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0270800301:386"/>
be original witneſſes of the miracles, paſſed their lives in labours, dangers and ſufferings, voluntarily undertaken and undergone in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the accounts which they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and properly in conſequence of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth of thoſe accounts."</p>

                  <p>BUT they, with whom we argue, have undoubtedly a right to elect their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. The inſtances with which Mr. Hume hath choſen to confront the miracles of the New Teſtament, and which, therefore, we are intitled to regard, as the ſtrongeſt which the hiſtory of the world could ſupply to the enquiries of a very acute and learned adverſary, are the three following:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The cure of a blind and of a lame man at Alexandria, by the Emperor Veſpaſian, as related by Tacitus;</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reſtoration of the limb of an attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in a Spaniſh church, as told by Cardinal de Retz; and</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The cures ſaid to be performed at the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0270800301:388"/>
tomb of the Abbé Paris, in the early part of the preſent century.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The narrative of Tacitus is delivered in theſe terms: "One of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Alexandria, known to be diſeaſed in his eyes, by the admonition of the god Serapis, whom that ſuperſtitious nation wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip above all other gods, proſtrated himſelf before the emperor, earneſtly imploring from him a remedy for his blindneſs, and entreating, that he would deign to anoint with his ſpittle his cheeks and the balls of his eyes. Another, diſeaſed in his hand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, by the admonition of the ſame god, that he might be touched by the foot of the emperor. Veſpaſian at firſt derided and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed their application; afterwards, when they continued to urge their petitions, he, ſometimes, appeared to dread the imputation of vanity; at other times, by the earneſt ſupplication of the patients, and the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his flatterers, to be induced to hope for ſucceſs. At length he commanded an enquiry to be made by phyſicians, whether
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0270800301:389"/>
ſuch a blindneſs and debility were vincible by human aid. The report of the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians contained various points; that in the one, the power of viſion was not deſtroyed, but would return, if the obſtacles were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; that, in the other, the diſeaſed joints might be reſtored, if a healing power were applied; that it was, perhaps, agreeable to the gods to do this; that the emperor was elected by divine aſſiſtance; laſtly, that the credit of the ſucceſs would be the emperor's, the ridicule of the diſappointment would fall upon the patients. Veſpaſian, believing that every thing was in the power of his fortune, and that nothing was any longer incredible, whilſt the multitude, which ſtood by, eagerly expected the event, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance expreſſive of joy executed what he was deſired to do. Immediately the hand was reſtored to its uſe, and light returned to the blind man. They, who were preſent, relate both theſe cures, even at this time, when there is nothing to be gained by lying <note n="*" place="bottom">Tac. Hiſt. lib. iv.</note>."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0270800301:390"/>
Now, though Tacitus wrote this account twenty-ſeven years after the miracle is ſaid to have been performed, and wrote at Rome of what paſſed at Alexandria, and wrote alſo from report; and although it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he had examined the ſtory, or that he believed it (but rather the contrary), yet I think his teſtimony ſufficient to prove, that ſuch a tranſaction took place: by which I mean, that the two men in queſtion did apply to Veſpaſian, that Veſpaſian did touch the diſeaſed in the manner related, and that a cure was reported to have followed the operation. But the affair labours under a ſtrong and juſt ſuſpicion, that the whole of it was a concerted impoſture brought about by colluſion, between the patients, the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and the emperor. This ſolution is probable, becauſe there was every thing to ſuggeſt, and every thing to facilitate ſuch a ſcheme. The miracle was calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to confer honour upon the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and upon the god Serapis. It was achieved in the midſt of the emperor's flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and followers; in a city, and amongſt
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0270800301:391"/>
a populace, beforehand devoted to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and to the worſhip of the god; where it would have been treaſon and blaſphemy together, to have contradicted the fame of the cure, or even to have queſtioned it. And what is very obſervable in the account is, that the report of the phyſicians is juſt ſuch a report as would have been made of a caſe, in which no external marks of the diſeaſe exiſted, and which, conſequently, was capable of being eaſily counterfeited, viz. that, in the firſt of the patients, the organs of viſion were not deſtroyed, that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſecond was in his joints. The ſtrongeſt circumſtance in Tacitus's narration is, that the firſt patient was <hi>"notus</hi> tabe ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum," remarked or notorious for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in his eyes. But this was a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which might have found its way into the ſtory in its progreſs from a diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and during an interval of thirty years; or it might be true that the malady of the eyes was notorious, yet that the nature and degree of the diſeaſe had never been aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: a caſe by no means uncommon.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0270800301:392"/>
The emperor's reſerve was eaſily affected; or it is poſſible he might not be in the ſecret. There does not ſeem to be much weight in the obſervation of Tacitus, that they who were preſent continued even then to relate the ſtory, when there was nothing to be gained by the lie. It only proves that thoſe who had told the ſtory for many years, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in it. The ſtate of mind of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and ſpectators <hi>at the time,</hi> is the point to be attended to. Still leſs is there of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency in Mr. Hume's eulogium upon the cautious and penetrating genius of the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian; for it does not appear that the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian believed it. The terms in which he ſpeaks of Serapis, the deity to whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the miracle was attributed, ſcarcely ſuffer us to ſuppoſe that Tacitus thought the miracle to be real, "by the admonition of the god Serapis, whom that ſuperſtitious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (dedita ſuperſtitionibus gens) worſhip above all other gods." To have brought this ſuppoſed miracle within the limits of compariſon with the miracles of Chriſt, it ought to have appeared, that a perſon of a
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0270800301:393"/>
low and private ſtation, in the midſt of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with the whole power of the country oppoſing him, with every one around him prejudiced or intereſted againſt his claims and character, pretended to perform theſe cures; and required the ſpectators, upon the ſtrength of what they ſaw, to give up their firmeſt hopes and opinions, and follow <hi>him</hi> through a life of trial and danger; that many were ſo moved, as to obey his call, at the expence, both of every notion in which they had been brought up, and of their eaſe, ſafety and reputation; and that by theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings a change was produced in the world, the effects of which remain to this day: a caſe, both in its circumſtances and conſequences, very unlike any thing we ſind in Tacitus's relation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſtory taken from the memoirs of Cardinal de Retz, which is the ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample alledged by Mr. Hume, is this: "In the church of Saragoſſa in Spain, the canons ſhewed me a man whoſe buſineſs it was to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0270800301:394"/>
light the lamps, telling me that he had been ſeveral years at the gate, with one leg only. I ſaw him with two <note n="*" place="bottom">Liv. iv. A. D. 1654.</note>."</p>
                  <p>It is ſtated by Mr. Hume, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal who relates this ſtory, did not believe it; and it no where appears, that he either examined the limb, or aſked the patient, or indeed any one, a ſingle queſtion about the matter. An artificial leg wrought with art, would be ſufficient, in a place where no ſuch contrivance had ever before been heard of, to give origin and currency to the report. The eccleſiaſtics of the place would, it is probable, favour the ſtory, inaſmuch as it advanced the honour of their image and church. And if <hi>they</hi> patronized it, no other perſon at Saragoſſa, in the middle of the laſt century, would care to diſpute it. The ſtory likewiſe coincided, not leſs with the wiſhes and preconceptions of the people, than with the intereſts of their eccleſiaſtical rulers; ſo that there was prejudice backed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0270800301:395"/>
by authority, and both operating upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ignorance, to account for the ſucceſs of the impoſture. If, as I have ſuggeſted, the contrivance of an artificial limb was then new, it would not occur to the Cardinal himſelf to ſuſpect it; eſpecially under the careleſſneſs of mind with which he heard the tale, and the little inclination he felt to ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinize or expoſe its fallacy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The miracles related to have been wrought at the tomb of the Abbé Paris, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in general of this ſolution. The patients who frequented the tomb, were ſo affected by their devotion, their expectation, the place, the ſolemnity, and, above all, by the ſympathy of the ſurrounding multitude, that many of them were thrown into violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, which convulſions, in certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, produced a removal of diſorders de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon obſtruction. We ſhall, at this day, have the leſs difficulty in admitting the above account, becauſe it is the very ſame thing, as hath lately been experienced in the operations of animal magnetiſm; and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0270800301:396"/>
the report of the French phyſicians upon that myſterious remedy is very applicable to the preſent conſideration, viz. that the pretenders to the art, by working upon the imaginations of their patients, were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently able to produce convulſions; that convulſions ſo produced are amongſt the moſt powerful, but, at the ſame time, moſt uncertain and unmanageable applications to the human frame, which can be employed.</p>
                  <p>Circumſtances, which indicate this expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the caſe of the Pariſian miracles, are the following:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were <hi>tentative.</hi> Out of many thouſand ſick, infirm, and diſeaſed perſons, who reſorted to the tomb, the profeſſed hiſtory of the miracles contains only nine cures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The convulſions at the tomb are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The diſeaſes were, for the moſt part,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0270800301:397"/>
of that ſort, which depends upon inaction and obſtruction, as dropſies, palſies, and ſome tumours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The cures were gradual; ſome patients attending many days, ſome ſeveral weeks, and ſome ſeveral months.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The cures were many of them incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Others were temporary <note n="*" place="bottom">The reader will find theſe particulars verified in the detail, by the accurate enquiries of the preſent biſhop of Sarum in his Criterion of Miracles, p. 132 et ſeq.</note>.</p>
                  <p>So that all the wonder we are called upon to account for is, that, out of an almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitude which reſorted to the tomb for the cure of their complaints, and many of whom were there agitated by ſtrong convulſions, a very ſmall proportion expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced a beneficial change in their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, eſpccially in the action of the nerves and glands.</p>

Some of the caſes alledged do not require that we ſhould have recourſe to this ſolution. The firſt caſe in the catalogue is ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable from the progreſs of a natural recovery. It was that of a young man, who laboured under an inflammation of one eye, and had loſt the ſight of the other. The inflamed eye was relieved, but the blindneſs of the other remained. The inflammation had before been abated by medicine; and the young man, at the time of his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the tomb, was uſing a lotion of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum. And, what is a ſtill more material part of the caſe, the inflammation after ſome interval returned. Another caſe was that of a young man who had loſt his ſight by the puncture of an awl, and the diſcharge of the aqueous humour through the wound. The ſight, which had been gradually return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was much improved during his viſit to the tomb, that is, probably in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which the diſcharged humour was replaced by freſh ſecretions. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that theſe two are the only caſes, which, from their nature, ſhould ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be affected by convulſions.</p>

In one material reſpect I allow, that the Pariſian miracles were different from thoſe related by Tacitus, and from the Spaniſh miracle of the Cardinal de Retz. They had not, like them, all the power and all the prejudice of the country on their ſide to begin with. They were alledged by one party againſt another, by the Janſeniſts againſt the Jeſuits. Theſe were of courſe oppoſed and examined by their adverſaries. The conſequence of which examination was, that many falſehoods were detected, that with ſomething really extraordinary much fraud appeared to be mixed. And if ſome of the caſes, upon which deſigned miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation could not be charged, were not at the time ſatisfactorily accounted for, it was becauſe the eſſicacy of ſtrong ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic affections was not then ſufficiently known. Finally, the cauſe of Janſeniſm did not riſe by the miracles, but ſunk, although the miracles had the anterior per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of all the numerous adherents of that cauſe to ſet out with.</p>

                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:0270800301:400"/>
Theſe, let us remember, are the ſtrongeſt examples, which the hiſtory of ages ſupplies. In none of them was the miracle <hi>unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal;</hi> by none of them were eſtabliſhed prejudices and perſuaſions overthrown; of none of them did the credit make its way, in oppoſition to authority and power; by none of them were many induced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves. and that in contradiction to prior opinions, to a life of mortification, danger, and ſufferings: none were called upon to atteſt them, at the expence of their fortunes and ſafety <note n="*" place="bottom">It may be thought that the hiſtorian of the Pariſian miracles, M. Montgeron, forms an exception to this laſt aſſertion. He preſented his book (with a ſuſpicion, as it ſhould ſeem, of the danger of what he was doing) to the king; and was ſhortly afterwards committed to priſon, from which he never came out. Had the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles been unequivocal, and had M. Montgeron been originally convinced by them, I ſhould have allowed this exception. It would have ſtood, I think, alone, in the argument of our adverſaries. But, beſide what has been obſerved of the dubious nature of the miracles, the account, which M. Montgeron has himſelf left of his converſion, ſhews both the ſtate of his mind, and <hi>that his perſuaſien was not built upon external miracles.</hi> "Scarcely had he entered the church-yard, when he was ſtruck," he tells us, "with awe and reverence, having never beſore heard prayers pronounced with ſo much ardour and tranſport, as he obſerved amongſt the ſupplicants at the tomb. Upon this, throwing himſelf on his knees, reſting his elbows on the tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and covering his face with his hands, he ſpake the following prayer: <hi>O thou, by whoſe interceſſion ſo many miracles are ſaid to be performed, if it be true that a part of thee ſurviveth the grave, and that thou haſt influence with the Almighty, have pity on the darkneſs of my underſtanding, and through his mercy obtain the removal of it.</hi> Having prayed thus, many thoughts, as he ſayeth, began to open themſelves to his mind; and ſo profound was his attention, that he continued on his knees four hours, not in the leaſt diſturbed by the vaſt crowd of ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupplicants. During this time all the arguments which he ever heard or read in favour of Chriſtianity, occurred to him with ſo much force, and ſeemed ſo ſtrong and convincing, that he went home fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the truth of religion in general, and of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and power of that perſon, who," as he ſuppoſed, "had engaged the divine goodneſs to enlighten his underſtanding ſo ſuddenly."
