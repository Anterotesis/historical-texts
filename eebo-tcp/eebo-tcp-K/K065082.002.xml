            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>UNDER the deplorable reigns of Valerian and Gallienus, the empire was oppreſſed and almoſt deſtroyed by the ſoldiers, the tyrants, and the barbarians. It was ſaved by a ſeries of great princes, who derived their obſcure origin from the martial provinces of Illyricum. Within a period of about thirty years, Claudius, Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian and his colleagues, triumphed over the foreign and domeſtic enemies of the ſtate, re-eſtabliſhed, with the military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, the ſtrength of the frontiers, and deſerved the glorious title of Reſtorers of the Roman world.</p>

The removal of an effeminate tyrant made way for a ſucceſſion of heroes. The indignation of the people imputed all their calamities to Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <note place="margin">Aureolus invades Italy, is defeated and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged at Milan.</note> and the far greater part were, indeed, the conſequence of his diſſolute manners and careleſs adminiſtration. He was even deſtitute of a ſenſe of honour, which ſo frequently ſupplies the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of public virtue; and as long as he was permitted to enjoy the poſſeſſion of Italy, a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the barbarians, the loſs of a province, or the rebellion of a general, ſeldom diſturbed the tranquil courſe of his pleaſures. At length, a conſiderable army, ſtationed on the Upper Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube, <note place="margin">A. D. 268.</note> inveſted with the Imperial purple their leader Aureolus; who diſdaining a confined and barren reign over the mountains of Rhaetia, paſſed the Alps, occupied Milan, threatened Rome, and challenged Gallienus to diſpute in the field the ſovereignty of Italy. The emperor, provoked by the inſult, and alarmed by the inſtant danger, ſuddenly exerted that latent vigour, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times broke through the indolence of his temper. Forcing himſelf from the luxury of the palace, he appeared in arms at the head of his legions, and advanced beyond the Po to encounter his compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor.

The excellent relation of the Chevalier de Folard, who was preſent, gives a very diſtinct idea of the ground.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0034700102:17"/>
object of the utmoſt importance to both armies. The Rhaetian uſurper, after receiving a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat and a dangerous wound, retired into Milan. The ſiege of that great city was immediately formed; the walls were battered with every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in uſe among the ancients; and Aureolus, doubtful of his internal ſtrength, and hopeleſs of foreign ſuccours, already anticipated the fatal conſequences of unſucceſsful rebellion.</p>
            <p>His laſt reſource was an attempt to ſeduce the loyalty of the beſiegers. He ſcattered libels through their camp, inviting the troops to deſert an unworthy maſter, who ſacrificed the public happineſs to his luxury, and the lives of his moſt valuable ſubjects to the ſlighteſt ſuſpicions. The arts of Aureolus diffuſed fears and diſcontent among the principal officers of his rival. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy was formed by Heraclianus the Praetorian praefect, by Marcian, a general of rank and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and by Cecrops, who commanded a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous body of Dalmatian guards. The death of Gallienus was reſolved; and notwithſtanding their deſire of firſt terminating the ſiege of Milan, the extreme danger which accompanied every moment's delay, obliged them to haſten the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their daring purpoſe. At a late hour of the night, but while the emperor ſtill protracted the pleaſures of the table, an alarm was ſuddenly given, that Aureolus, at the head of all his forces, had made a deſperate ſally from the town; Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus, who was never deficient in perſonal bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſtarted from his ſilken couch, and, without
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0034700102:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
allowing himſelf time either to put on his armour or to aſſemble his guards, he mounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and rode full ſpeed toward the ſuppoſed place of the attack. Encompaſſed by his declared or concealed enemies, he ſoon, amidſt the noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal tumult, received a mortal dart from an uncertain hand. Before he expired, a patriotic <note place="margin">A. D. 268. March 20.

The report at leaſt was diligently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, and the order cheerfully obeyed by the conſpirators, who had already agreed to place Claudius on the throne. On the firſt news of the emperor's death, the troops expreſſed ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and reſentment, till the one was removed, and the other aſſuaged, by a donative of twenty pieces of gold to each ſoldier. They then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the election, and acknowledged the merit of their new ſovereign <note n="2" place="bottom">On the death of Gallienus, ſee Trebellius Pollio in Hiſt.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0034700102:19"/>
the meanneſs of his birth. We can only diſcover that he was a native of one of the provinces bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the Danube; that his youth was ſpent in arms, and that his modeſt valour attracted the favour and confidence of Decius. The ſenate and people already conſidered him as an excellent officer, equal to the moſt important truſts; and cenſured the inattention of Valerian, who ſuffered him to remain in the ſubordinate ſtation of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune. But it was not long before that emperor diſtinguiſhed the merit of Claudius, by declaring him general and chief of the Illyrian frontier, with the command of all the troops in Thrace, Maeſia, Dacia, Pannonia, and Dalmatia, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of the praefect of Egypt, the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the proconſul of Africa, and the ſure proſpect of the conſulſhip. By his victories over the Goths, he deſerved from the ſenate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a ſtatue, and excited the jealous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Gallienus. It was impoſſible that a ſoldier could eſteem ſo diſſolute a ſovereign, nor is it eaſy to conceal a juſt contempt. Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded expreſſions which dropt from Claudius, were officiouſly tranſmitted to the royal ear. The emperor's anſwer to an officer of confidence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes in very lively colours his own character and that of the times. <q>There is not any thing capable of giving me more ſerious concern, than the intelligence contained in your laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch <note n="4" place="bottom">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0034700102:20"/>
indiſpoſed towards us the mind of our friend and <hi>parent</hi> Claudius. As you regard your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, uſe every means to appeaſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, but conduct your negociation with ſecrecy; let it not reach the knowledge of the Dacian troops; they are already provoked, and it might inflame their fury. I myſelf have ſent him ſome preſents: be it your care that he accept them with pleaſure. Above all, let him not ſuſpect that I am made acquainted with his imprudence. The fear of my anger might urge him to deſperate counſels <note n="5" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 208. Gallienus deſcribes the plate, veſtments, &amp;c. like a man who loved and underſtood thoſe ſplendid trifles.</note>.</q> The preſents which accompanied this humble epiſtle, in which the monarch ſolicited a reconciliation with his diſcontented ſubject, conſiſted of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum of money, a ſplendid wardrobe, and a valuable ſervice of ſilver and gold plate. By ſuch arts Gallienus ſoftened the indignation, and diſpelled the fears, of his Illyrian general; and, during the remainder of that reign, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable ſword of Claudius was always drawn in the cauſe of a maſter whom he deſpiſed. At laſt, indeed, he received from the conſpirators the bloody purple of Gallienus: but he had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from their camp and counſels; and however he might applaud the deed, we may candidly preſume that he was innocent of the knowledge of it <note n="6" place="bottom">Julian (Orat. i. p. 6.) affirms that Claudius acquired the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in a juſt and even holy manner.

The ſiege of Milan was ſtill continued, and Aureolus ſoon diſcovered, that the ſucceſs of his artifices had only raiſed up a more determined <note place="margin">Death of Aureolus.</note> adverſary. He attempted to negociate with Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius a treaty of alliance and partition. <q>Tell him, replied the intrepid emperor, that ſuch propoſals ſhould have been made to Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus; <hi>he,</hi> perhaps, might have liſtened to them with patience, and accepted a colleague as deſpicable as himſelf <note n="7" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 203. There are ſome trifling differences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the circumſtances of the laſt defeat and death of Aureolus.</note>.</q> This ſtern refuſal, and a laſt unſucceſsful effort, obliged Aureolus to yield the city and himſelf to the diſcretion of the conqueror. The judgment of the army pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him worthy of death, and Claudius, after a feeble reſiſtance, conſented to the execution of the ſentence. Nor was the zeal of the ſenate leſs ardent in the cauſe of their new ſovereign. They ratified, perhaps with a ſincere tranſport of zeal, the election of Claudius; and as his predeceſſor had ſhewn himſelf the perſonal enemy of their order, they exerciſed under the name of juſtice a ſevere revenge againſt his friends and family. The ſenate was permitted to diſcharge the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful office of puniſhment, and the emperor reſerved for himſelf the pleaſure and merit of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by his interceſſion a general act of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note n="8" place="bottom">Aurelius Victor in Gallien. The people loudly prayed for the damnation of Gallienus. The ſenate decreed that his relations and ſervants ſhould be thrown down headlong from the Gemonian ſtairs. An obnoxious officer of the revenue had his eyes torn out whilſt under examination.</note>.</p>

Such oſtentatious clemency diſcovers leſs of the real character of Claudius, than a trifling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which he ſeems to have conſulted only <note place="margin">Clemency and juſtice of Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius.</note> the dictates of his heart. The frequent rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of the provinces had involved almoſt every perſon in the guilt of treaſon, almoſt every eſtate in the caſe of confiſcation; and Gallienus often diſplayed his liberality, by diſtributing among his officers the property of his ſubjects. On the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Claudius, an old woman threw herſelf at his feet, and complained that a general of the late emperor had obtained an arbitrary grant of her patrimony. This general was Claudius him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who had not entirely eſcaped the contagion of the times. The emperor bluſhed at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, but deſerved the confidence which ſhe had repoſed in his equity. The confeſſion of his fault was accompanied with immediate and ample reſtitution <note n="9" place="bottom">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 137.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the arduous taſk which Claudius had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, <note place="margin">He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the army.</note> of reſtoring the empire to its ancient ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, it was firſt neceſſary to revive among his troops a ſenſe of order and obedience. With the authority of a veteran commander, he repreſented to them, that the relaxation of diſcipline had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a long train of diſorders, the effects of which were at length experienced by the ſoldiers themſelves; that a people ruined by oppreſſion, and indolent from deſpair, could no longer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a numerous army with the means of luxury, or even of ſubſiſtence; that the danger of each individual had increaſed with the deſpotiſm of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0034700102:23"/>
military order, ſince princes who tremble on the throne, will guard their ſafety by the inſtant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of every obnoxious ſubject. The emperor expatiated on the miſchiefs of a lawleſs caprice which the ſoldiers could only gratify at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their own blood; as their ſeditious elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had ſo frequently been followed by civil wars, which conſumed the flower of the legions either in the field of battle or in the cruel abuſe of victory. He painted in the moſt lively colours the exhauſted ſtate of the treaſury, the deſolation of the provinces, the diſgrace of the Roman name, and the inſolent triumph of rapacious bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. It was againſt thoſe barbarians, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he intended to point the firſt effort of their arms. Tetricus might reign for a while over the Weſt, and even Zenobia might preſerve the dominion of the Eaſt <note n="10" place="bottom">Zonaras on this occaſion mentions Poſthumus; but the regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſenate (Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 203.) prove that Tetricus was already emperor of the weſtern provinces.</note>. Theſe uſurpers were his perſonal adverſaries; nor could he think of indulging any private reſentment till he had ſaved an empire, whoſe impending ruin would, unleſs it was timely prevented, cruſh both the army and the people.</p>

On the banks of the Nieſter, one of the great rivers that diſcharge themſelves into that ſea, they conſtructed a fleet of two thouſand, or even
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0034700102:24"/>
of ſix thouſand veſſels <note n="11" place="bottom">The Auguſtan Hiſtory mentions the ſmaller, Zonaras the larger, number; the lively fancy of Monteſquieu induced him to prefer the latter.</note>; numbers which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever incredible they may ſeem, would have been inſufficient to tranſport their pretended army of three hundred and twenty thouſand barbarians. Whatever might be the real ſtrength of the Goths, the vigour and ſucceſs of the expedition were not adequate to the greatneſs of the preparations. In their paſſage through the Boſphorus, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful pilots were overpowered by the violence of the current; and while the multitude of their ſhips were crowded in a narrow channel, many were daſhed againſt each other, or againſt the ſhore. The barbarians made ſeveral deſcents on the coaſts both of Europe and Aſia; but the open country was already plundered, and they were repulſed with ſhame and loſs from the fortified cities which they aſſaulted. A ſpirit of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and diviſion aroſe in the fleet, and ſome of their chiefs ſailed away towards the iſlands of Crete and Cyprus; but the main body purſuing a more ſteady courſe, anchored at length near the foot of mount Athos, and aſſaulted the city of Theſſalonica, the wealthy capital of all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian provinces. Their attacks, in which they diſplayed a fierce but artleſs bravery, were ſoon interrupted by the rapid approach of Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, haſtening to a ſcene of action that deſerved the preſence of a warlike prince at the head of the remaining powers of the empire.

I. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive battle was fought near Naiſſus, a city of Dardania. The legions at firſt gave way, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by numbers, and diſmayed by misfortunes. Their ruin was inevitable, had not the abilities of their emperor prepared a ſeaſonable relief. A large detachment riſing out of the ſecret and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult paſſes of the mountains, which, by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they had occupied, ſuddenly aſſailed the rear of the victorious Goths. The favorable inſtant was improved by the activity of Claudius. He revived the courage of his troops, reſtored their ranks, and preſſed the barbarians on every ſide. Fifty thouſand men are reported to have been ſlain in the battle of Naiſſus. Several large bodies of barbarians, covering their retreat with a moveable fortification of waggons, retired, or rather eſcaped, from the field of ſlaughter. II. We may preſume that ſome inſurmountable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, the fatigue, perhaps, or the diſobedience, of the conquerors, prevented Claudius from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting in one day the deſtruction of the Goths. The war was diffuſed over the provinces of Maeſia, Thrace, and Macedonia, and its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions drawn out into a variety of marches, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0034700102:27"/>
and tumultuary engagements, as well by ſea as by land. When the Romans ſuffered any loſs, it was commonly occaſioned by their own cowardice or raſhneſs; but the ſuperior talents of the emperor, his perfect knowledge of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and his judicious choice of meaſures as well as officers, aſſured on moſt occaſions the ſucceſs of his arms. The immenſe booty, the fruit of ſo many victories, conſiſted for the greater part of cattle and ſlaves. A ſelect body of the Gothic youth was received among the Imperial troops; the remainder was ſold into ſervitude; and ſo conſiderable was the number of female captives, that every ſoldier obtained to his ſhare two or three women. A circumſtance from which we may conclude, that the invaders entertained ſome deſigns of ſettlement as well as of plunder; ſince even in a naval expedition they were accompanied by their families. III. The loſs of their fleet, which was either taken or ſunk, had intercepted the retreat of the Goths. A vaſt circle of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man poſts diſtributed with ſkill, ſupported with firmneſs, and gradually cloſing towards a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon centre, forced the barbarians into the moſt inacceſſible parts of mount Haemus, where they found a ſafe refuge, but a very ſcanty ſubſiſtence. During the courſe of a rigorous winter, in which they were beſieged by the emperor's troops, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and peſtilence, deſertion and the ſword, continually diminiſhed the impriſoned multitude. On the return of ſpring, nothing appeared in <note place="margin">A. D. 270.</note> arms except a hardy and deſperate band, the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0034700102:28"/>
remnant of that mighty hoſt which had embarked at the mouth of the Nieſter.</p>
            <p>The peſtilence which ſwept away ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the barbarians, at length proved fatal to <note place="margin">March. Death of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Aurelian for his ſucceſſor.</note> their conqueror. After a ſhort but glorious reign of two years, Claudius expired at Sirmium, amidſt the tears and acclamations of his ſubjects. In his laſt illneſs, he convened the principal officers of the ſtate and army, and in their preſence recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Aurelian, one of his generals, as the moſt deſerving of the throne, and the beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to execute the great deſign which he himſelf had been permitted only to undertake. The virtues of Claudius, his valour, affability <note n="14" place="bottom">According to Zonaras (l. xii. p. 638.), Claudius, before his death, inveſted him with the purple; but this ſingular fact is rather contradicted than confirmed by other writers.</note>, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and temperance, his love of fame and of his country, place him in that ſhort liſt of emperors who added luſtre to the Roman purple. Thoſe virtues, however, were celebrated with peculiar zeal and complacency by the courtly writers of the age of Conſtantine, who was the great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Criſpus, the elder brother of Claudius. The voice of flattery was ſoon taught to repeat, that the gods, who ſo haſtily had ſnatched Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius from the earth, rewarded his merit and piety by the perpetual eſtabliſhment of the empire in his family <note n="15" place="bottom">See the life of Claudius by Pollio, and the orations of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mertinus, Eumenius, and Julian.

Notwithſtanding theſe oracles, the greatneſs of the Flavian family (a name which it had pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to aſſume) was deferred above twenty <note place="margin">The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and fall of Quintilius.</note> years, and the elevation of Claudius occaſioned the immediate ruin of his brother Quintilius, who poſſeſſed not ſufficient moderation or courage to deſcend into the private ſtation to which the patriotiſm of the late emperor had condemned him. Without delay or reflection, he aſſumed the purple at Aquileia, where he commanded a conſiderable force; and though his reign laſted only ſeventeen days, he had time to obtain the ſanction of the ſenate, and to experience a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the troops. As ſoon as he was informed that the great army of the Danube had inveſted the well-known valour of Aurelian with Imperial power, he ſunk under the fame and merit of his rival; and ordering his veins to be opened, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <note place="margin">April.</note> withdrew himſelf from the unequal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <note n="16" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. i. p. 42.

roſe to the rank of a centurion, a tribune, the praefect of a legion, the inſpector of the camp, the general, or, as it was then called, the duke, of a frontier; and at length, during the Gothic war, exerciſed the important office of commander in chief of the cavalry. In every ſtation he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed himſelf by matchleſs valour <note n="17" place="bottom">Theoclius (as quoted in the Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 211.) affirms, that in one day he killed, with his own hand, forty-eight Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and in ſeveral ſubſequent engagements nine hundred and fifty. This heroic valour was admired by the ſoldiers, and celebrated in their rude ſongs, the burden of which was <hi>mille, mille, mille occidit.</hi>
               </note>, rigid diſcipline, and ſucceſsful conduct. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the conſulſhip by the emperor Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who ſtyles him, in the pompous language of that age, the deliverer of Illyricum, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of Gaul, and the rival of the Scipios. At the recommendation of Valerian, a ſenator of the higheſt rank and merit, Ulpius Crinitus, whoſe blood was derived from the ſame ſource as that of Trajan, adopted the Pannonian peaſant, gave him his daughter in marriage, and relieved with his ample fortune the honourable poverty which Aurelian had preſerved inviolate <note n="18" place="bottom">Acholius (ap. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 213.) deſcribes the ceremony of the adoption, as it was performed at Byzantium, in the preſence of the emperor and his great officers.</note>.</p>
            <p>The reign of Aurelian laſted only four years <note place="margin">Aurelian's ſucceſsful reign.</note> and about nine months; but every inſtant of that ſhort period was filled by ſome memorable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement. He put an end to the Gothic war, chaſtiſed the Germans who invaded Italy, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Gaul, Spain, and Britain out of the hands of Tetricus, and deſtroyed the proud monarchy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0034700102:31"/>
which Zenobia had erected in the Eaſt, on the ruins of the afflicted empire.</p>
            <p>It was the rigid attention of Aurelian, even to the minuteſt articles of diſcipline, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed <note place="margin">His ſevere diſcipline.</note> ſuch uninterrupted ſucceſs on his arms. His military regulations are contained in a very conciſe epiſtle to one of his inferior officers, who is commanded to enforce them, as he wiſhes to become a tribune, or as he is deſirous to live. Gaming, drinking, and the arts of divination, were ſeverely prohibited. Aurelian expected that his ſoldiers ſhould be modeſt, frugal, and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; that their armour ſhould be conſtantly kept bright, their weapons ſharp, their clothing and horſes ready for immediate ſervice; that they ſhould live in their quarters with chaſtity and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, without damaging the corn fields, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtealing even a ſheep, a fowl, or a bunch of grapes, without exacting from their landlords, either ſalt, or oil, or wood. <q>The public al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, continues the emperor, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for their ſupport; their wealth ſhould be collected from the ſpoil of the enemy, not from the tears of the provincials <note n="19" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 211. This laconic epiſtle is truly the work of a ſoldier; it abounds with military phraſes and words, ſome of which cannot be underſtood without difficulty. <hi>Ferramenta ſamiata</hi> is well explained by Salmaſius. The former of the words means all weapons of offence, [and is contraſted with <hi>Arma,</hi> defenſive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. The latter ſignifies keen and well ſharpened.</note>.</q> A ſingle inſtance will ſerve to diſplay the rigour, and even cruelty, of Aurelian. One of the ſoldiers had ſeduced the wife of his hoſt. The guilty wretch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0034700102:32"/>
was faſtened to two trees forcibly drawn towards each other, and his limbs were torn aſunder by their ſudden ſeparation. A few ſuch examples impreſſed a ſalutary conſternation. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Aurelian were terrible; but he had ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom occaſion to puniſh more than once the ſame offence. His own conduct gave a ſanction to his laws, and the ſeditious legions dreaded a chief who had learned to obey, and who was worthy to command.</p>
            <p>The death of Claudius had revived the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit of the Goths. The troops which guarded the paſſes of Mount Haemus, and the <note place="margin">He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a treaty with the Goths,</note> banks of the Danube, had been drawn away by the apprehenſion of a civil war; and it ſeems probable that the remaining body of the Gothic and Vandalic tribes embraced the favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, abandoned their ſettlements of the Ukraine, traverſed the rivers, and ſwelled with new multitudes the deſtroying hoſt of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. Their united numbers were at length encountered by Aurelian, and the bloody and doubtful conflict ended only with the approach of night <note n="20" place="bottom">Zoſim. l. i. p. 45.</note>. Exhauſted by ſo many calamities, which they had mutually endured and inflicted during a twenty years war, the Goths and the Romans conſented to a laſting and beneficial treaty. It was earneſtly ſolicited by the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and cheerfully ratified by the legions, to whoſe ſuffrage the prudence of Aurelian referred the deciſion of that important queſtion. The
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0034700102:33"/>
Gothic nation engaged to ſupply the armies of Rome with a body of two thouſand auxiliaries, conſiſting entirely of cavalry, and ſtipulated in return an undiſturbed retreat, with a regular market as far as the Danube, provided by the emperor's care, but at their own expence. The treaty was obſerved with ſuch religious fidelity, that when a party of five hundred men ſtraggled from the camp in queſt of pluner, the king or general of the barbarians commanded that the guilty leader ſhould be apprehended and ſhot to death with darts, as a victim devoted to the ſanctity of their engagements. It is, however, not unlikely, that the precaution of Aurelian, who had exacted as hoſtages the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Gothic chiefs, contributed ſomething to this pacific temper. The youths he trained in the exerciſe of arms, and near his own perſon: to the damſels he gave a liberal and Roman edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and by beſtowing them in marriage on ſome of his principal officers, gradually intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced between the two nations the cloſeſt and moſt endearing connexions <note n="21" place="bottom">Dexippus (ap.

            <p>But the moſt important condition of peace was <note place="margin">and reſigns to them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Dacia.</note> underſtood rather than expreſſed in the treaty. Aurelian withdrew the Roman forces from Dacia, and tacitly relinquiſhed that great province to the Goths and Vandals <note n="22" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 222. Eutrop. ix. 15. Sextus Rufus, c. 9. Lactantius de mortibus Perſecutorum, c. 9.</note>. His manly judgment
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0034700102:34"/>
convinced him of the ſolid advantages, and taught him to deſpiſe the ſeeming diſgrace, of thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the frontiers of the monarchy. The Dacian ſubjects, removed from thoſe diſtant poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions which they were unable to cultivate or defend, added ſtrength and populouſneſs to the ſouthern ſide of the Danube. A fertile territory, which the repetition of barbarous inroads had changed into a deſert, was yielded to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and a new province of Dacia ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the memory of Trajan's conqueſts. The old country of that name detained, however, a conſiderable number of its inhabitants, who dreaded exile more than a Gothic maſter <note n="23" place="bottom">The Walachians ſtill preſerve many traces of the Latin lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and have boaſted, in every age, of their Roman deſcent. They are ſurrounded by, but not mixed with, the barbarians. See a Memoir of M. d'Anville on ancient Dacia, in the Academy of Inſcriptions, tom. xxx.</note>. Theſe degenerate Romans continued to ſerve the empire, whoſe allegiance they had renounced, by introducing among their conquerors the firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of agriculture, the uſeful arts, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of civiliſed life. An intercourſe of commerce and language was gradually eſtabliſhed between the oppoſite banks of the Danube; and after Dacia became an independent ſtate, it often proved the firmeſt barrier of the empire againſt the invaſions of the ſavages of the North. A ſenſe of intereſt attached theſe more ſettled bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians to the alliance of Rome, and a permanent intereſt very frequently ripens into ſincere and uſeful friendſhip. This various colony, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0034700102:35"/>
filled the ancient province, and was inſenſibly blended into one great people, ſtill acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſuperior renown and authority of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic tribe, and claimed the fancied honour of a Scandinavian origin. At the ſame time the lucky though accidental reſemblance of the name of Gaeta, infuſed among the credulous Goths a vain perſuation, that, in a remote age, their own anceſtors, already ſeated in the Dacian provinces, had received the inſtructions of Zamolxis, and checked the victorious arms of Seſoſtis and Darius <note n="24" place="bottom">See the firſt chapter of Jornandes.

            <p>The emperor was almoſt at the ſame time <note place="margin">A. D. 270. September.</note> informed of the irruption, and of the retreat, of the barbarians. Collecting an active body of troops, he marched with ſilence and celerity along the ſkirts of the Hercynian foreſt; and the Alemanni, laden with the ſpoils of Italy, arrived at the Danube, without ſuſpecting, that on the oppoſite bank, and in an advantageous poſt, a Roman army lay concealed and prepared to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept their return. Aurelian indulged the fatal ſecurity of the barbarians, and permitted about half their forces to paſs the river without diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and without precaution. Their ſituation and aſtoniſhment gave him an eaſy victory; his ſkilful conduct improved the advantage. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the legions in a ſemicircular form, he advanced the two horns of the creſcent acroſs the Danube, and wheeling them on a ſudden towards the centre, incloſed the rear of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hoſt.

            <p>Reduced to this diſtreſſed condition, the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni no longer diſdained to ſue for peace. Aurelian received their ambaſſadors at the head of his camp, and with every circumſtance of

The principal commanders, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the enſigns of their rank, appeared on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back on either ſide of the Imperial throne.

They were commanded to riſe, and permitted to ſpeak. By the aſſiſtance of interpreters they extenuated their perfidy, magnified their exploits, expatiated on the viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of fortune and the advantages of peace, and, with an ill-timed confidence, demanded a large ſubſidy, as the price of the alliance which they offered to the Romans. The anſwer of the emperor was ſtern and imperious. He treated their offer with contempt, and their demand with indignation, reproached the barbarians, that they were as ignorant of the arts of war as of the laws of peace, and finally diſmiſſed them with the choice only of ſubmitting to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditioned

            <p>Immediately after this conference, it ſhould <note place="margin">The Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Italy,</note> ſeem that ſome unexpected emergency required the emperor's preſence in Pannonia.

But an active deſpair has often triumphed over the indolent aſſurance of ſucceſs. The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, finding it impoſſible to traverſe the Danube and the Roman camp, broke through the poſts in their rear, which were more feebly or leſs carefully guarded; and with incredible diligence, but by a different road, returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mountains of Italy <note n="32" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 215.</note>. Aurelian, who conſidered the war as totally extinguiſhed, received the mortifying intelligence of the eſcape of the Allemanni, and of the ravage which they already committed in the territory of Milan. The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were commanded to follow, with as much expedition as thoſe heavy bodies were capable of exerting, the rapid flight of an enemy, whoſe infantry and cavalry moved with almoſt equal ſwiftneſs. A few days afterwards the emperor himſelf marched to the relief of Italy, at the

            <p>As the light troops of the Alemanni had ſpread <note place="margin">and are at laſt van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by Aurelian.</note> themſelves from the Alps to the Apennine, the inceſſant vigilance of Aurelian and his officers was exerciſed in the diſcovery, the attack, and the purſuit of the numerous detachments.

In the firſt, fought near Placentia, the Romans received ſo ſevere a blow, that, according to the expreſſion of a writer extremely partial to Aurelian, the immediate diſſolution of the empire was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <note n="35" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 216.</note>. The crafty barbarians, who had lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the woods, ſuddenly attacked the legions in the duſk of the evening, and, it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, after the fatigue and diſorder of a long march. The fury of their charge was irreſiſtible; but at length, after a dreadful ſlaughter, the patient firmneſs of the emperor rallied his troops, and reſtored, in ſome degree, the honour of his arms. The ſecond battle was fought near Fano in Umbria; on the ſpot which, five hundred years before, had been fatal to the brother of Hannibal <note n="36" place="bottom">The little river or rather torrent of Metaurus near Fano, has been immortalized, by finding ſuch an hiſtorian as Livy, and ſuch a poet as Horace.</note>. Thus far the ſucceſsful Germans

had advanced along the Aemilian and Flaminian way, with a deſign of ſacking the defenceleſs miſtreſs of the world. But Aurelian, who, watchful for the ſafety of Rome, ſtill hung on their rear, found in this place the deciſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of giving them a total and irretrievable defeat <note n="37" place="bottom">It is recorded by an inſcription found at Pezaro.

Though the beſt hope of the republic was in the valour and conduct of Aurelian, yet ſuch was the public conſternation, when the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians were hourly expected at the gates of Rome, that, by a decree of the ſenate, the Sibylline books were conſulted. Even the emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from a motive either of religion or of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, recommended this ſalutary meaſure, chided the tardineſs of the ſenate <note n="38" place="bottom">One ſhould imagine, he ſaid, that you were aſſembled in a Chriſtian church, not in the temple of all the gods.</note>, and offered to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply whatever expence, whatever animals, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever captives of any nation, the gods ſhould require. Notwithſtanding this liberal offer, it does not appear, that any human victims expiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their blood the ſins of the Roman peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

However puerile in themſelves, theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious arts were ſubſervient to the ſucceſs of the war; and if, in the deciſive battle of Fano, the Alemanni fancied they ſaw an army of ſpectres combating on the ſide of Aurelian, he received a real and effectual aid from this imaginary rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement <note n="39" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt.

            <p>But whatever confidence might be placed in <note place="margin">Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Rome.</note> ideal ramparts, the experience of the paſt, and the dread of the future, induced the Romans to conſtruct fortifications of a groſſer and more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial kind. The ſeven hills of Rome had been ſurrounded, by the ſucceſſors of Romulus, with an ancient wall of more than thirteen miles <note n="40" place="bottom">Plin. Hiſt. Natur. iii. 5. To confirm our idea, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that for a long time Mount Caelius was a grove of oaks, and Mount Viminal was over-run with oſiers; that, in the fourth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, the Aventine was a vacant and ſolitary eetirement; that, till the time of Auguſtus, the Eſquiline was an unwholeſome burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground; and that the numerous inequalities, remarked by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in the Quirinal, ſufficiently prove that it was not covered with buildings.

The arts and treaſures of Victoria enabled her ſucceſſively to place Marius and Tetricus on the throne, and to reign with a manly vigour under the name of thoſe dependent emperors. Money of copper, of ſilver, and of gold, was coined in her name; ſhe aſſumed the titles of Auguſta and Mother of the Camps: her power ended only with her life; but her life was perhaps ſhortened by the ingratitude of Tetricus <note n="49" place="bottom">Pollio aſſigns her an article among the thirty tyrants.

He reigned four or five years over Gaul, Spain, and Britain, the ſlave and ſovereign of a licentious army, whom he dreaded, and by whom he was deſpiſed.

the proſpect of a deliverance. He ventured to diſcloſe his melancholy ſituation, and conjured the emperor to haſten to the relief of his unhappy <note place="margin">A. D. 271. Summer.</note> rival.

            <p>As early as the reign of Claudius, the city of Autun, alone and unaſſiſted, had ventured to declare againſt the legions of Gaul.

She was of a dark complexion (for in ſpeaking of a lady, theſe trifles become important). Her teeth were of a pearly whiteneſs, and her large black eyes ſparkled with uncommon fire, tempered by the moſt attractive ſweetneſs. Her voice was ſtrong and harmonious. Her manly underſtanding was ſtrengthened and adorned by ſtudy. She was not ignorant of the Latin tongue, but poſſeſſed in equal perfection the Greek, the Syriac, and the Egyptian languages. She had drawn up for her own uſe an epitome of oriental hiſtory, and familiarly compared the beauties of Homer and Plato under the tuition of the ſublime Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</p>
            <p>This accompliſhed woman gave her hand to <note place="margin">her valour.</note> Odenathus, who from a private ſtation raiſed himſelf to the dominion of the Eaſt. She ſoon became the friend and companion of a hero. In the intervals of war, Odenathus paſſionately delighted in the exerciſe of hunting; he purſued with ardour the wild beaſts of the deſert, lions, panthers, and bears; and the ardour of Zenobia in that dangerous amuſement was not inferior to his own. She had inured her conſtitution to fatigue, diſdained the uſe of a covered carriage,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0034700102:49"/>
generally appeared on horſeback in a military habit, and ſometimes marched ſeveral miles on foot at the head of the troops. The ſucceſs of Odenathus was in a great meaſure aſcribed to her incomparable prudence and fortitude. Their ſplendid victories over the Great King, whom they twice purſued as far as the gates of Cteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, laid the foundations of their united fame and power. The armies which they commanded, and the provinces which they had ſaved, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged not any other ſovereigns than their invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible chiefs. The ſenate and people of Rome revered a ſtranger who had avenged their captive emperor, and even the inſenſible ſon of Valerian accepted Odenathus for his legitimate colleague.</p>

Auguſt. p. 180, 181.</note>. Inſtead of the little paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which ſo frequently perplex a female reign, the ſteady adminiſtration of Zenobia was guided by the moſt judicious maxims of policy. If it was expedient to pardon, ſhe could calm her reſentment: if it was neceſſary to puniſh, ſhe could impoſe ſilence on the voice of pity. Her ſtrict oeconomy was accuſed of avarice; yet on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0034700102:51"/>
every proper occaſion ſhe appeared magnificent and liberal. The neighbouring ſtates of Arabia, Armenia, and Perſia, dreaded her enmity, and ſolicited her alliance. To the dominions of Odenathus, which extended from the Euphrates to the frontiers of Bithynia, his widow added the inheritance of her anceſtors, the populous and fertile kingdom of Egypt. The emperor Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius acknowledged her merit, and was content, that, while <hi>he</hi> purſued the Gothic war, <hi>ſhe</hi> ſhould aſſert the dignity of the empire in the Eaſt <note n="60" place="bottom">See in Hiſt.

The conduct, however, of Zenobia, was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome ambiguity; nor is it unlikely that ſhe had conceived the deſign of erecting an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent and hoſtile monarchy. She blended with the popular manners of Roman princes the ſtately pomp of the courts of Aſia, and exacted from her ſubjects the ſame adoration that was paid to the ſucceſſors of Cyrus.

In both, the queen of Palmyra animated the armies by her preſence, and devolved the execution of her orders on Zabdas, who had already ſignalized his military talents by the conqueſt of Egypt. The nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous forces of Zenobia conſiſted for the moſt part of light archers, and of heavy cavalry clothed in complete ſteel. The Mooriſh and Illyrian horſe of Aurelian were unable to ſuſtain the ponderous charge of their antagoniſts.

Even the name of Tadmor, or Palmyra, by its ſignification in the Syriac as well as in the Latin language, denoted the multitude of palm trees which afforded ſhade and verdure to that temperate region. The air was pure, and the ſoil, watered by ſome invaluable ſprings, was capable of producing fruits as well as corn. A place poſſeſſed of ſuch ſingular advantages, and ſituated at a convenient diſtance <note n="68" place="bottom">It was five hundred and thirty-ſeven miles from Seleucia, and two hundred and three from the neareſt coaſt of Syria, according to the reckoning of Pliny, who, in a few words (Hiſt.

The elevation of Odenathus and Zenobia appeared to reflect new ſplendour on their country, and Palmyra, for a while, ſtood forth the rival of Rome: but the competition was fatal, and ages of proſperity were ſacrificed to a moment of glory <note n="69" place="bottom">Some Engliſh travellers from Aleppo <hi>diſcovered</hi> the ruins of Palmyra, about the end of the laſt century.

            <p>In his march over the ſandy deſert between <note place="margin">It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by Aurelian,</note> Emeſa and Palmyra, the emperor Aurelian was perpetually haraſſed by the Arabs; nor could he always defend his army, and eſpecially his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, from thoſe flying troops, of active and daring robbers, who watched the moment of ſurpriſe, and eluded the ſlow purſuit of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. The ſiege of Palmyra was an object far more difficult and important, and the emperor, who, with inceſſant vigour, preſſed the attacks in perſon, was himſelf wounded with a dart. <q>The Roman people, ſays Aurelian, in an original letter, ſpeak with contempt of the

But fortune and the perſeverance of Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian overcame every obſtacle. The death of Sapor, which happened about this time <note n="71" place="bottom">From a very doubtful chronology I have endeavoured to extract the moſt probable date.</note>, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the councils of Perſia, and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſuccours that attempted to relieve Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myra,

were eaſily intercepted either by the arms or the liberality of the emperor. From every part of Syria, a regular ſucceſſion of convoys ſafely arrived in the camp, which was increaſed by the return of Probus with his victorious troops from the conqueſt of Egypt.

The courage of Zenobia deſerted her in the hour of trial; ſhe trembled at the angry clamours of the ſoldiers, who called aloud for her immediate execution, forgot the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſpair of Cleopatra, which ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as her model, and ignominiouſly purchaſed life by the ſacrifice of her fame and her friends. It was to their counſels which governed the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her ſex, that ſhe imputed the guilt of her obſtinate reſiſtance; it was on their heads that ſhe directed the vengeance of the cruel Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. The fame of Longinus, who was included among the numerous and perhaps innocent vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims of her fear, will ſurvive that of the queen who betrayed, or the tyrant who condemned him.

Returning from the conqueſt of the Eaſt, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian had already croſſed the Streights which divide Europe from Aſia, when he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked <note place="margin">Rebellion and ruin of Palmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</note> by the intelligence that the Palmyrenians had maſſacred the governor and garriſon which he had left among them, and again erected the ſtandard of revolt.

Antioch was alarmed by his rapid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and the helpleſs city of Palmyra felt the irreſiſtible weight of his reſentment. We have a letter of Aurelian himſelf, in which he acknowledges <note n="75" place="bottom">Hiſt.

But it is eaſier to deſtroy than to reſtore. The ſeat of commerce, of arts, and of Zenobia, gradually ſunk into an obſcure town, a trifling fortreſs, and at length a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able village.

Palmyra, had ariſen on the banks of the Nile. Firmus, the friend and ally, as he proudly ſtyled himſelf, of Odenathus and Zenobia, was no more than a wealthy merchant of Egypt. In the courſe of his trade to India, he had formed very intimate connexions with the Saracens and the Blemmyes, whoſe ſituation on either coaſt of the Red Sea gave them an eaſy introduction into the Upper Egypt. The Egyptians he inflamed with the hope of freedom, and, at the head of their furious multitude, broke into the city of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, where he aſſumed the Imperial purple, coined money, publiſhed edicts, and raiſed an army, which, as he vainly boaſted, he was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of maintaining from the ſole profits of his paper trade. Such troops were a feeble defence againſt the approach of Aurelian; and it ſeems almoſt unneceſſary to relate, that Firmus was routed, taken, tortured, and put to death. Aurelian might now congratulate the ſenate, the people, and himſelf, that in little more than three years, he had reſtored univerſal peace and order to the Roman world <note n="76" place="bottom">See Vopiſcus in Hiſt.

The pomp was opened by twenty elephants, four royal tigers, and above two hundred of the moſt curious animals from every climate of the North, the Eaſt, and the South. They were followed by ſixteen hundred gladiators, devoted to the cruel amuſement of the amphitheatre. The wealth of Aſia, the arms and enſigns of ſo many conquered nations, and the magnificent plate and wardrobe of the Syrian queen, were diſpoſed in exact ſymmetry or artful diſorder. The ambaſſadors of the moſt remote parts of the earth, of Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, Arabia, Perſia, Bactriana, India, and China, all remarkable by their rich or ſingular dreſſes, diſplayed the fame and power of the Roman emperor, who expoſed likewiſe to the public view the preſents that he had received, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly a great number of crowns of gold, the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of grateful cities. The victories of Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian were atteſted by the long train of captives who reluctantly attended his triumph, Goths, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alemanni, Franks, Gauls, Syrians, and Egyptians.

the crowd of captives, was fixed on the emperor Tetricus, and the queen of the Eaſt. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as well as his ſon, whom he had created Auguſtus, was dreſſed in Gallic trowſers <note n="79" place="bottom">The uſe of <hi>Braccae,</hi> breeches, or trowſers, was ſtill conſidered in Italy as a Gallic and Barbarian faſhion.

            <p>But however, in the treatment of his unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate rivals, Aurelian might indulge his pride, <note place="margin">His treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tetricus and Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia.</note> he behaved towards them with a generous cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, which was ſeldom exerciſed by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient conquerors.

Theſe uſurpers, whom their defeat had convicted of the crime of treaſon, were permitted to ſpend their lives in affluence and honourable repoſe. The emperor preſented Zenobia with an elegant villa at Tibur, or Tivoli, about twenty miles from the capital; the Syrian queen inſenſibly ſunk into a Roman matron, her daughters married into noble families, and her race was not yet extinct in the fifth century <note n="82" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0034700102:66"/>
of reformation. Even his attempt to reſtore the integrity of the coin, was oppoſed by a formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſurrection. The emperor's vexation breaks out in one of his private letters. <q>Surely, ſays he, the gods have decreed that my life ſhould be a perpetual warfare. A ſedition within the walls has juſt now given birth to a very ſerious civil war. The workmen of the mint, at the inſtigation of Feliciſſimus, a ſlave to whom I had intruſted an employment in the finances, have riſen in rebellion. They are at length ſuppreſſed; but ſeven thouſand of my ſoldiers have been ſlain in the conteſt, of thoſe troops whoſe ordinary ſtation is in Dacia, and the camps along the Danube <note n="88" place="bottom">Hiſt.

            <p>We might content ourſelves with relating this <note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon it.</note> extraordinary tranſaction, but we cannot diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how much in its preſent form it appears to us inconſiſtent and incredible. The debaſement of the coin is indeed well ſuited to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Gallienus; nor is it unlikely that the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0034700102:67"/>
inſtruments of the corruption might dread the inflexible juſtice of Aurelian. But the guilt, as well as the profit, muſt have been confined to a few; nor is it eaſy to conceive by what arts they could arm a people whom they had injured, againſt a monarch whom they had betrayed. We might naturally expect, that ſuch miſcreants ſhould have ſhared the public deteſtation, with the informers and the other miniſters of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and that the reformation of the coin ſhould have been an action equally popular with the deſtruction of thoſe obſolete accounts, which by the emperor's orders were burnt in the forum of Trajan <note n="90" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 222. Aurel. Victor.</note>. In an age when the principles of commerce were ſo imperfectly underſtood, the moſt deſirable end might perhaps be effected by harſh and injudicious means; but a temporary grievance of ſuch a nature can ſcarcely excite and ſupport a ſerious civil war. The repetition of intolerable taxes, impoſed either on the land or on the neceſſaries of life, may at laſt provoke thoſe who will not, or who cannot, relinquiſh their country. But the caſe is far otherwiſe in every operation which, by whatſoever expedients, reſtores the juſt value of money. The tranſient evil is ſoon obliterated by the permanent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, the loſs is divided among multitudes; and if a few wealthy individuals experience a ſenſible diminution of treaſure, with their riches, they at the ſame time loſe the degree of weight and importance which they derived from the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0034700102:68"/>
of them. However Aurelian might chuſe to diſguiſe the real cauſe of the inſurrection, his reformation of the coin could only furniſh a faint pretence to a party already powerful and diſcontented. Rome, though deprived of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was diſtracted by faction. The people, towards whom the emperor, himſelf a plebeian, always expreſſed a peculiar fondneſs, lived in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſſention with the ſenate, the equeſtrian order, and the Praetorian guards <note n="91" place="bottom">It already raged before Aurelian's return from Egypt.

His love of juſtice often became a blind and furious paſſion; and whenever he deemed his own or the public ſafety endangered, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded the rules of evidence, and the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of puniſhments. The unprovoked rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion with which the Romans rewarded his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, exaſperated his haughty ſpirit.

A haſty ſpirit of revenge urged the bloody proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and it proved fatal to one of the nephews of the emperor.

It was obſerved by one of the moſt ſagacious of the Roman princes, that the talents of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor Aurelian, were better ſuited to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">He march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es into the Eaſt, and is aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</note> of an army, than to the government of an empire <note n="95" place="bottom">It was the obſervation of Diocletian.

At the head of an army, leſs formidable by its numbers than by its diſcipline and valour, the emperor advanced as far as the Streights which divide Europe from Aſia. He there experienced, that the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power is a weak defence againſt the effects of deſpair. He had threatened one of his ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries who was accuſed of extortion; and it was known that he ſeldom threatened in vain. The laſt hope which remained for the criminal, was to involve ſome of the principal officers of the army in his danger, or at leaſt in his fears.

            </head>
            <p>SUCH was the unhappy condition of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man emperors, that, whatever might be their conduct, their fate was commonly the ſame. A <note place="margin">Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the army and the ſenate for the choice of an empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> life of pleaſure or virtue, of ſeverity or mildneſs, of indolence or glory, alike led to an untimely grave; and almoſt every reign is cloſed by the ſame diſguſting repetition of treaſon and murder. The death of Aurelian, however, is remarkable by its extraordinary conſequences. The legions admired, lamented, and revenged, their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious chief. The artifice of his perfidious ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary was diſcovered and puniſhed. The deluded conſpirators attended the funeral of their injured ſovereign, with ſincere or well-feigned contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſubmitted to the unanimous reſolution of the military order, which was ſignified by the following epiſtle. <q>The brave and fortunate armies to the ſenate and people of Rome. The crime of one man, and the error of many, have deprived us of the late emperor Aurelian. May it pleaſe you, venerable lords and fathers! to place him in the number of the gods, and to appoint a ſucceſſor whom your judgment ſhall declare worthy of the Imperial purple! None of thoſe, whoſe guilt or misfortune have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0034700102:73"/>
contributed to our loſs, ſhall ever reign over us <note n="1" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 222. Aurelius Victor mentions a formal deputation from the troops to the ſenate.</note>.</q> The Roman ſenators heard, without ſurpriſe, that another emperor had been aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in his camp: they ſecretly rejoiced in the fall of Aurelian; but the modeſt and dutiful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the legions, when it was communicated in full aſſembly by the conſul, diffuſed the moſt pleaſing aſtoniſhment. Such honours as fear and perhaps eſteem could extort, they liberally poured forth on the memory of their deceaſed ſovereign. Such acknowledgments as gratitude could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, they returned to the faithful armies of the republic, who entertained ſo juſt a ſenſe of the legal authority of the ſenate in the choice of an emperor. Yet, notwithſtanding this flattering appeal, the moſt prudent of the aſſembly declined expoſing their ſafety and dignity to the caprice of an armed multitude. The ſtrength of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions was, indeed, a pledge of their ſincerity, ſince thoſe who may command are ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the neceſſity of diſſembling; but could it naturally be expected, that a haſty repentance would correct the inveterate habits of fourſcore years? Should the ſoldiers relapſe into their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed ſeditions, their inſolence might diſgrace the majeſty of the ſenate, and prove fatal to the object of its choice. Motives like theſe dictated a decree, by which the election of a new em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was referred to the ſuffrage of the military order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0034700102:74"/>
The contention that enſued is one of the beſt atteſted, but moſt improbable events in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of mankind <note n="2" place="bottom">Vopiſcus, our principal authority, wrote at Rome, ſixteen years only after the death of Aurelian; and, beſides the recent notoriety of the facts, conſtantly draws his materials from the Journals of the Senate, and the original papers of the Ulpian library. Zoſimus and Zonaras appear as ignorant of this tranſaction as they were in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Roman conſtitution.</note>. The troops, as if ſatiated <note place="margin">A. D. 275. Feb. 3.</note> with the exerciſe of power, again conjured the <note place="margin">A peaceful interreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num of eight months.</note> ſenate to inveſt one of its own body with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial purple. The ſenate ſtill perſiſted in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal; the army in its requeſt. The reciprocal offer was preſſed and rejected at leaſt three times, and whilſt the obſtinate modeſty of either party was reſolved to receive a maſter from the hands of the other, eight months inſenſibly elapſed: an amazing period of tranquil anarchy, during which the Roman world remained without a ſovereign, without an uſurper, and without a ſedition. The generals and magiſtrates appointed by Aurelian continued to execute their ordinary functions; and it is obſerved, that a proconſul of Aſia was the only conſiderable perſon removed from his office, in the whole courſe of the interregnum.</p>
            <p>An event ſomewhat ſimilar, but much leſs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic, is ſuppoſed to have happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and character, bore ſome affinity with Aurelian. The throne was vacant during twelve months, till the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sabine philoſopher, and the public peace was guarded in the ſame manner, by the union of the ſeveral orders of the ſtate. But, in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0034700102:75"/>
time of Numa and Romulus, the arms of the people were controlled by the authority of the Patricians; and the balance of freedom was eaſily preſerved in a ſmall and virtuous community <note n="3" place="bottom">Liv. i. 17. Dionyſ. Halicarn. l. ii. p. 115. Plutarch in Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, p. 60. The firſt of theſe writers relates the ſtory like an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the ſecond like a lawyer, and the third like a moraliſt, and none of them probably without ſome intermixture of fable.</note>. The decline of the Roman ſtate, far different from its infancy, was attended with every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that could baniſh from an interregnum the proſpect of obedience and harmony: an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe and tumultuous capital, a wide extent of empire, the ſervile equality of deſpotiſm, an army of four hundred thouſand mercenaries, and the experience of frequent revolutions. Yet, notwithſtanding all theſe temptations, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and memory of Aurelian ſtill reſtrained the ſeditious temper of the troops, as well as the fatal ambition of their leaders. The flower of the legions maintained their ſtations on the banks of the Boſphorus, and the Imperial ſtandard awed the leſs powerful camps of Rome and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. A generous though tranſient enthuſiaſm ſeemed to animate the military order; and we may hope that a few real patriots cultivated the returning friendſhip of the army and the ſenate, as the only expedient capable of reſtoring the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public to its ancient beauty and vigour.</p>
            <p>On the twenty-fifth of September, near eight months after the murder of Aurelian, the conſul <note place="margin">A. D. 275. Sept. 25.</note> convoked an aſſembly of the ſenate, and reported <note place="margin">The conſul aſſembles the ſenate.</note>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0034700102:76"/>
the doubtful and dangerous ſituation of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He ſlightly inſinuated, that the precarious loyalty of the ſoldiers depended on the chance of every hour, and of every accident; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, with the moſt convincing eloquence, the various dangers that might attend any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay in the choice of an emperor. Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he ſaid, was already received, that the Germans had paſſed the Rhine, and occupied ſome of the ſtrongeſt and moſt opulent cities of Gaul. The ambition of the Perſian king kept the Eaſt in perpetual alarms; Egypt, Africa, and Illyricum, were expoſed to foreign and domeſtic arms, and the levity of Syria would prefer even a female ſceptre to the ſanctity of the Roman laws. The conſul then addreſſing himſelf to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, the firſt of the ſenators <note n="4" place="bottom">
                  <q>Vopiſcus (in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 227.) calls him <q>primae ſententiae conſularis;</q> and ſoon afterwards <hi>Princeps ſenatûs.</hi>
                  </q> It is natural to ſuppoſe, that the monarchs of Rome, diſdaining that humble title, reſigned it to the moſt ancient of the ſenators.</note>, required his opinion on the important ſubject of a proper can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for the vacant throne.</p>
            <p>If we can prefer perſonal merit to accidental greatneſs, we ſhall eſteem the birth of Tacitus <note place="margin">Character of Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> more truly noble than that of kings. He claimed his deſcent from the philoſophic hiſtorian, whoſe writings will inſtruct the laſt generations of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <note n="5" place="bottom">The only objection to this genealogy, is, that the hiſtorian was named Cornelius, the emperor, Claudius. But under the lower empire, ſurnames were extremely various and uncertain.</note>. The ſenator Tacitus was then ſeventy-five

years of age <note n="6" place="bottom">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 637. The Alexandrian Chronicle, by an obvious miſtake, transfers that age to Aurelian.</note>. The long period of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent life was adorned with wealth and honours. He had twice been inveſted with the conſular dignity <note n="7" place="bottom">In the year 273, he was ordinary conſul. But he muſt have been Suffectus many years before, and moſt probably under Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</note>, and enjoyed with elegance and ſobriety his ample patrimony of between two and three millions ſterling <note n="8" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Bis millies octingenties.</hi> Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 229. This ſum, according to the old ſtandard, was equivalent to eight hundred and forty thouſand Roman pounds of ſilver, each of the value of three pounds ſterling. But in the age of Tacitus, the coin had loſt much of its weight and purity.</note>. The experience of ſo many princes, whom he had eſteemed or endured, from the vain follies of Elagabalus to the uſeful rigour of Aurelian, taught him to form a juſt eſtimate of the duties, the dangers, and the temptations, of their ſublime ſtation. From the aſſiduous ſtudy of his immortal anceſtor he derived the knowledge of the Roman conſtitution, and of human nature <note n="9" place="bottom">After his acceſſion, he gave orders that ten copies of the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſhould be annually tranſcribed and placed in the public libraries. The Roman libraries have long ſince periſhed, and the moſt valuable part of Tacitus was preſerved in a ſingle MS. and diſcovered in a monaſtery of Weſtphalia. See Bayle, Dictionnaire, Art. <hi>Tacite,</hi> and Lipſius ad Annal. ii. 9.</note>. The voice of the people had already named Tacitus as the citizen the moſt worthy of empire. The ungrateful rumour reached his ears, and induced him to ſeek the retirement of one of his villas in Campania. He had paſſed two months in the delightful privacy of Baiae, when he reluctantly obeyed the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0034700102:78"/>
of the conſul to reſume his honourable place in the ſenate, and to aſſiſt the republic with his counſels on this important occaſion.</p>
            <p>He aroſe to ſpeak, when, from every quarter of the houſe, he was ſaluted with the names of <note place="margin">He is elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</note> Auguſtus and Emperor. <q>Tacitus Auguſtus, the gods preſerve thee, we chuſe thee for our ſovereign, to thy care we intruſt the republic and the world. Accept the empire from the authority of the ſenate. It is due to thy rank, to thy conduct, to thy manners.</q> As ſoon as the tumult of acclamations ſubſided, Tacitus attempted to decline the dangerous honour, and to expreſs his wonder, that they ſhould elect his age and infirmities to ſucceed the martial vigour of Aurelian. <q>Are theſe limbs, conſcript fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers! fitted to ſuſtain the weight of armour, or to practiſe the exerciſes of the camp? The variety of climates, and the hardſhips of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary life, would ſoon oppreſs a feeble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which ſubſiſts only by the moſt tender management. My exhauſted ſtrength ſcarcely enables me to diſcharge the duty of a ſenator; how inſufficient would it prove to the arduous labours of war and government? Can you hope, that the legions will reſpect a weak old man, whoſe days have been ſpent in the ſhade of peace and retirement? Can you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that I ſhould ever find reaſon to regret the favourable opinion of the ſenate <note n="10" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 227.</note>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reluctance of Tacitus, and it might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly <note place="margin">and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the purple.</note> be ſincere, was encountered by the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0034700102:79"/>
obſtinacy of the ſenate. Five hundred voices repeated at once, in eloquent confuſion, that the greateſt of the Roman princes, Numa, Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines, had aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the throne in a very advanced ſeaſon of life; that the mind, not the body, a ſovereign, not a ſoldier, was the object of their choice; and that they expected from him no more than to guide by his wiſdom the valour of the legions. Theſe preſſing though tumultuary inſtances were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by a more regular oration of Metius Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius, the next on the conſular bench to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus himſelf. He reminded the aſſembly of the evils which Rome had endured from the vices of headſtrong and capricious youths, congratulated them on the election of a virtuous and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced ſenator, and, with a manly, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a ſelfiſh, freedom, exhorted Tacitus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the reaſons of his elevation, and to ſeek a ſucceſſor, not in his own family, but in the republic. The ſpeech of Falconius was enforced by a general acclamation. The emperor elect ſubmitted to the authority of his country, and received the voluntary homage of his equals. The judgment of the ſenate was confirmed by the conſent of the Roman people, and of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian guards <note n="11" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 228. Tacitus addreſſed the Praetorians by the appellation of <hi>ſanctiſſimi milites,</hi> and the people by that of <hi>ſacratiſſimi Quirites.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The adminiſtration of Tacitus was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his life and principles. A grateful <note place="margin">Authority of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> ſervant of the ſenate, he conſidered that national
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0034700102:80"/>
council as the author, and himſelf as the ſubject, of the laws <note n="12" place="bottom">In his manumiſſions he never exceeded the number of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, as limited by the Caninian law, which was enacted under Auguſtus, and at length repealed by Juſtinian. See Caſaubon ad locum Vopiſci.</note>. He ſtudied to heal the wounds which Imperial pride, civil diſcord, and military violence, had inflicted on the conſtitution, and to reſtore, at leaſt, the image of the ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, as it had been preſerved by the policy of Auguſtus, and the virtues of Trajan and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonines. It may not be uſeleſs to recapitulate ſome of the moſt important prerogatives which the ſenate appeared to have regained by the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tacitus <note n="13" place="bottom">See the lives of Tacitus, Florianus, and Probus, in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtan Hiſtory; we may be well aſſured, that whatever the ſoldier gave, the ſenator had already given.</note>. 1.

They were twelve in number, who, in ſucceſſive pairs, each, during the ſpace of two months, filled the year, and repreſented the dignity of that ancient office. The authority of the ſenate, in the nomination of the conſuls, was exerciſed with ſuch independent freedom, that no regard was paid to an irregular requeſt of the emperor in favour of his brother Florianus. <q>The ſenate, exclaimed Tacitus, with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt tranſport of a patriot, underſtand the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a prince whom they have choſen.</q>

To give force and validity, by their decrees, to ſuch as they ſhould approve of the emperor's edicts. 6. To theſe ſeveral branches of authority, we may add ſome inſpection over the finances, ſince, even in the ſtern reign of Aurelian, it was in their power to divert a part of the revenue from the public ſervice <note n="14" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt.

            <p>All that had yet paſſed at Rome was no more than a theatrical repreſentation, unleſs it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified <note place="margin">A. D. 276.

As ſoon as the praefect was ſilent, the emperor addreſſed himſelf to the ſoldiers with eloquence and propriety.

Thoſe barbarians, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by preſents and ſubſidies, had promiſed to invade Perſia with a numerous body of light ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry. They were faithful to their engagements; but when they arrived on the Roman frontier, Aurelian was already dead, the deſign of the Perſian war was at leaſt ſuſpended, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, who, during their interregnum, exerciſed a doubtful authority, were unprepared either to receive or to oppoſe them. Provoked by ſuch treatment, which they conſidered as trifling and perfidious, the Alani had recourſe to their own valour for their payment and revenge; and as they moved with the uſual ſwiftneſs of Tartars, they had ſoon ſpread themſelves over the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia. The legions, who from the oppoſite ſhores of the Boſphorus could almoſt diſtinguiſh the flames of the cities and villages, impatiently urged their general to lead them againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders. The conduct of Tacitus was ſuitable to his age and ſtation. He convinced the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, of the faith, as well as of the power, of the empire.

which Aurelian had contracted with them, relinquiſhed their booty and captives, and quietly retreated to their own deſerts, beyond the Phaſis. Againſt the remainder who refuſed peace, the Roman emperor waged, in perſon, a ſucceſsful war. Seconded by an army of brave and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced veterans, in a few weeks he delivered the provinces of Aſia from the terror of the Scythian invaſion <note n="17" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt.

            <p>But the glory and life of Tacitus were of ſhort <note place="margin">Death of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> duration. Tranſported, in the depth of winter, from the ſoft retirement of Campania, to the foot of mount Caucaſus, he ſunk under the unaccuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed hardſhips of a military life. The fatigues of the body were aggravated by the cares of the mind. For a while, the angry and ſelfiſh paſſions of the ſoldiers had been ſuſpended by the enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm of public virtue. They ſoon broke out with redoubled violence, and raged in the camp, and even in the tent, of the aged emperor. His mild and amiable character ſerved only to inſpire contempt, and he was inceſſantly tormented with factions which he could not aſſuage, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which it was impoſſible to ſatisfy. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever flattering expectations he had conceived of reconciling the public diſorders, Tacitus ſoon was convinced, that the licentiouſneſs of the army
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0034700102:85"/>
diſdained the feeble reſtraint of laws, and his laſt hour was haſtened by anguiſh and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It may be doubtful whether the ſoldiers imbrued their hands in the blood of this innocent prince <note n="18" place="bottom">Eutropius and Aurelius Victor only ſay that he died; Victor Junior adds, that it was of a fever. Zoſimus and Zonaras affirm, that he was killed by the ſoldiers. Vopiſcus mentions both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and ſeems to heſitate. Yet ſurely theſe jarring opinions are eaſily reconciled.</note>. It is certain, that their inſolence was the cauſe of his death. He expired at Tyana in Cappadocia, after a reign of only ſix months and <note place="margin">A. D. 276. April 12.</note> about twenty days <note n="19" place="bottom">According to the two Victors, he reigned exactly two hundred days.</note>.</p>
            <p>The eyes of Tacitus were ſcarcely cloſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Uſurpation and death of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus.</note> his brother Florianus ſhewed himſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to reign, by the haſty uſurpation of the purple, without expecting the approbation of the ſenate. The reverence for the Roman conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which yet influenced the camp and the provinces, was ſufficiently ſtrong to diſpoſe them to cenſure, but not to provoke them to oppoſe, the precipitate ambition of Florianus. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content would have evaporated in idle murmurs, had not the general of the Eaſt, the heroic Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, boldly declared himſelf the avenger of the ſenate. The conteſt, however, was ſtill unequal; nor could the moſt able leader, at the head of the effeminate troops of Egypt and Syria, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, with any hopes of victory, the legions of Europe, whoſe irreſiſtible ſtrength appeared to ſupport the brother of Tacitus. But the fortune
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0034700102:86"/>
and activity of Probus triumphed over every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle. The hardy veterans of his rival, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to cold climates, ſickened and conſumed away in the ſultry heats of Cilicia, where the ſummer proved remarkably unwholeſome. Their numbers were diminiſhed by frequent deſertion, the paſſes of the mountains were feebly defended; Tarſus opened its gates, and the ſoldiers of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus, when they had permitted him to enjoy the Imperial title about three months, delivered the empire from civil war by the eaſy ſacrifice of <note place="margin">July.</note> a prince whom they deſpiſed <note n="20" place="bottom">Hiſt.

            <p>The perpetual revolutions of the throne had ſo <note place="margin">Their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</note> perfectly eraſed every notion of hereditary right, that the family of an unfortunate emperor was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of exciting the jealouſy of his ſucceſſors. The children of Tacitus and Florianus were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to deſcend into a private ſtation, and to mingle with the general maſs of the people. Their poverty indeed became an additional ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard to their innocence. When Tacitus was elected by the ſenate, he reſigned his ample pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony to the public ſervice <note n="21" place="bottom">Hiſt.

The only conſolation of their fallen ſtate, was the remembrance of tranſient

greatneſs, and a diſtant hope, the child of a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering prophecy, that at the end of a thouſand years, a monarch of the race of Tacitus ſhould ariſe, the protector of the ſenate, the reſtorer of Rome, and the conqueror of the whole earth <note n="22" place="bottom">He was to ſend judges to the Parthians, Perſians, and Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, a preſident to Taprobana, and a proconſul to the Roman iſland (ſuppoſed by Caſaubon and Salmaſius to mean Britain). Such a hiſtory as mine (ſays Vopiſcus with proper modeſty) will not ſubſiſt a thouſand years to expoſe or juſtify the prediction.</note>.</p>
            <p>The peaſants of Illyricum, who had already <note place="margin">Character and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the emperor Probus.</note> given Claudius and Aurelian to the ſinking em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, had an equal right to glory in the elevation of Probus <note n="23" place="bottom">For the private life of Probus, ſee Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 234-237.</note>. Above twenty years before, the emperor Valerian, with his uſual penetration, had diſcovered the riſing merit of the young ſoldier, on whom he conferred the rank of tribune, long before the age preſcribed by the military regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The tribune ſoon juſtified his choice, by a victory over a great body of Sarmatians, in which he ſaved the life of a near relation of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian; and deſerved to receive from the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's hand the collars, bracelets, ſpears, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the mural and the civic crown, and all the honourable rewards reſerved by ancient Rome for ſucceſsful valour. The third, and afterwards the tenth, legion were intruſted to the command of Probus, who, in every ſtep of his promotion, ſhewed himſelf ſuperior to the ſtation which he filled.

him the moſt ſplendid occaſions of diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his perſonal proweſs and his conduct in war. Aurelian was indebted to him for the conqueſt of Egypt, and ſtill more indebted for the honeſt courage with which he often checked the cruelty of his maſter. Tacitus, who deſired by the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of his generals to ſupply his own deficiency of military talents, named him commander in chief of all the eaſtern provinces, with five times the uſual ſalary, the promiſe of the conſulſhip, and the hope of a triumph. When Probus aſcended the Imperial throne, he was about forty-four years of age <note n="24" place="bottom">According to the Alexandrian Chronicle, he was fifty at the time of his death.</note>; in the full poſſeſſion of his fame, of the love of the army, and of a mature vigour of mind and body.</p>
            <p>His acknowledged merit, and the ſucceſs of <note place="margin">His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful conduct towards the ſenate.</note> his arms againſt Florianus, left him without an enemy or a competitor. Yet, if we may credit his own profeſſions, very far from being deſirous of the empire, he had accepted it with the moſt ſincere reluctance. <q>But it is no longer in my power, ſays Probus, in a private letter, to lay down a title ſo full of envy and of danger.

A decree immediately paſſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſſenting voice, to ratify the election of the eaſtern armies, and to confer on their chief all the ſeveral branches of the Imperial dignity: the names of Caeſar and Auguſtus, the title of Father of his country, the right of making in the ſame day three motions in the ſenate <note n="27" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 238. It is odd, that the ſenate ſhould treat Probus leſs favourably than Marcus Antoninus.

of Pontifex Maximus, the tribunitian power, and the proconſular command; a mode of inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, though it ſeemed to multiply the authority of the emperor, expreſſed the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ancient republic. The reign of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus correſponded with this fair beginning. The ſenate was permitted to direct the civil admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the empire. Their faithful general aſſerted the honour of the Roman arms, and often laid at their feet crowns of gold and barbaric trophies, the fruits of his numerous victories <note n="28" place="bottom">See the dutiful letter of Probus to the ſenate, after his German victories. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 239.</note>. Yet, whilſt he gratified their vanity, he muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly have deſpiſed their indolence and weakneſs. Though it was every moment in their power to repeal the diſgraceful edict of Gallienus, the proud ſucceſſors of the Scipios patiently acquieſced in their excluſion from all military employments.

            <p>The ſtrength of Aurelian had cruſhed on every ſide the enemies of Rome. After his death they <note place="margin">Victories of Probus over the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</note> ſeemed to revive with an increaſe of fury and of numbers. They were again vanquiſhed by the active vigour of Probus, who, in a ſhort reign of about ſix years <note n="29" place="bottom">The date and duration of the reign of Probus are very correctly aſcertained by Cardinal Noris, in his learned work, De Epochis Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro-Macedonum, p. 96—105. A paſſage of Euſebius connects the ſecond year of Probus, with the aeras of ſeveral of the Syrian cities.</note>, equalled the fame of ancient heroes, and reſtored peace and order to every province of the Roman world. The dangerous
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0034700102:91"/>
frontier of Rhaetia he ſo firmly ſecured, that he left it without the ſuſpicion of an enemy. He broke the wandering power of the Sarmatian tribes, and by the terror of his arms compelled thoſe barbarians to relinquiſh their ſpoil. The Gothic nation courted the alliance of ſo warlike an emperor <note n="30" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 239.</note>. He attacked the Iſaurians in their mountains, beſieged and took ſeveral of their ſtrongeſt caſtles <note n="31" place="bottom">Zoſimus (l. i. p. 62—65.) tells a very long and trifling ſtory of Lycius the Iſaurian robber.</note>, and flattered himſelf that he had for ever ſuppreſſed a domeſtic foe, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence ſo deeply wounded the majeſty of the empire. The troubles excited by the uſurper Firmus in the Upper Egypt, had never been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly appeaſed, and the cities of Ptolemais and Coptos, fortified by the alliance of the Blemmyes, ſtill maintained an obſcure rebellion. The chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of thoſe cities, and of their auxiliaries the ſavages of the South, is ſaid to have alarmed the court of Perſia <note n="32" place="bottom">Zoſim. l. i. p. 65. Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 239, 240. But it ſeems incredible, that the defeat of the Savages of Aethiopia could affect the Perſian monarch.</note>, and the Great King ſued in vain for the friendſhip of Probus. Moſt of the exploits which diſtinguiſhed his reign, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved by the perſonal valour and conduct of the emperor, inſomuch that the writer of his life expreſſes ſome amazement how, in ſo ſhort a time, a ſingle man could be preſent in ſo many diſtant wars. The remaining actions he intruſted to the care of his lieutenants, the judicious choice of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0034700102:92"/>
whom forms no inconſiderable part of his glory. Carus, Diocletian, Maximian, Conſtantius, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius, Aſclepiodatus, Annibalianus, and a crowd of other chiefs, who afterwards aſcended or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the throne, were trained to arms in the ſevere ſchool of Aurelian and Probus <note n="33" place="bottom">Beſides theſe well-known chiefs, ſeveral others are named by Vopiſcus (Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 241.), whoſe actions have not reached our knowledge.</note>.</p>
            <p>But the moſt important ſervice which Probus <note place="margin">A. D. 277.</note> rendered to the republic, was the deliverance of <note place="margin">He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Gaul from the invaſion of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</note> Gaul, and the recovery of ſeventy flouriſhing cities oppreſſed by the barbarians of Germany, who, ſince the death of Aurelian, had ravaged that great province with impunity <note n="34" place="bottom">See the Caeſars of Julian, and Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 238. 240, 241.</note>. Among the various multitude of thoſe fierce invaders, we may diſtinguiſh, with ſome degree of clearneſs, three great armies, or rather nations, ſucceſſively vanquiſhed by the valour of Probus. He drove back the Francs into their moraſſes; a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive circumſtance from whence we may infer, that the confederacy known by the manly appellation of <hi>Free,</hi> already occupied the flat maritime coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, interſected and almoſt overflown by the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating waters of the Rhine, and that ſeveral tribes of the Friſians and Batavians had acceded to their alliance. He vanquiſhed the Burgundians, a conſiderable people of the Vandalic race. They had wandered in queſt of booty from the banks of the Oder to thoſe of the Seine. They eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves ſufficiently fortunate to purchaſe, by the reſtitution of all their booty, the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0034700102:93"/>
of an undiſturbed retreat. They attempted to elude that article of the treaty. Their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was immediate and terrible <note n="35" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. i. p. 62. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 240. But the latter ſuppoſe the puniſhment inflicted with the conſent of their kings; if ſo, it was partial, like the offence.</note>. But of all the invaders of Gaul, the moſt formidable were the Lygians, a diſtant people who reigned over a wide domain on the frontiers of Poland and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia <note n="36" place="bottom">See Cluver. Germania Antiqua, l. iii. Ptolemy places in their country the city of Caliſia, probably Caliſh in Sileſia.</note>. In the Lygian nation, the Arii held the firſt rank by their numbers and fierceneſs. <q>The Arii (it is thus that they are deſcribed by the energy of Tacitus) ſtudy to improve by art and circumſtances the innate terrors of their barbariſm. Their ſhields are black, their bodies are painted black. They chuſe for the combat the darkeſt hour of the night. Their hoſt advances, covered as it were with a fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real ſhade <note n="37" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Feralis umbra,</hi> is the expreſſion of Tacitus: it is ſurely a very bold one</note>; nor do they often find an enemy capable of ſuſtaining ſo ſtrange and infernal an aſpect. Of all our ſenſes, the eyes are the firſt vanquiſhed in battle <note n="38" place="bottom">Tacit. Germ. (c. 43.)</note>.</q> Yet the arms and diſcipline of the Romans eaſily diſcomfited theſe horrid phantoms. The Lygii were defeated in a general engagement, and Semno, the moſt renowned of their chiefs, fell alive into the hands of Probus. That prudent emperor, unwilling to reduce a brave people to diſpair, granted them an honourable capitulation, and permitted them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0034700102:94"/>
to return in ſafety to their native country. But the loſſes which they ſuffered in the march, the battle, and the retreat, broke the power of the nation: nor is the Lygian name ever repeated in the hiſtory either of Germany or of the empire. The deliverance of Gaul is reported to have coſt the lives of four hundred thouſand of the invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; a work of labour to the Romans, and of expence to the emperor, who gave a piece of gold for the head of every barbarian <note n="39" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 238.</note>. But as the fame of warriors is built on the deſtruction of human kind, we may naturally ſuſpect, that the ſanguinary account was multiplied by the avarice of the ſoldiers, and accepted without any very ſevere examination by the liberal vanity of Probus.</p>
            <p>Since the expedition of Maximin, the Roman <note place="margin">and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his arms into Germany.</note> generals had confined their ambition to a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive war againſt the nations of Germany, who perpetually preſſed on the frontiers of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The more daring Probus purſued his Gallic victories, paſſed the Rhine, and diſplayed his invincible eagles on the banks of the Elbe and the Neckar. He was fully convinced, that nothing could reconcile the minds of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians to peace, unleſs they experienced in their own country the calamities of war. Germany, exhauſted by the ill ſucceſs of the laſt emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was aſtoniſhed by his preſence. Nine of the moſt conſiderable princes repaired to his camp, and fell proſtrate at his feet. Such a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0034700102:95"/>
treaty was humbly received by the Germans, as it pleaſed the conqueror to dictate. He exacted a ſtrict reſtitution of the effects and captives which they had carried away from the provinces; and obliged their own magiſtrates to puniſh the more obſtinate robbers who preſumed to detain any part of the ſpoil. A conſiderable tribute of corn, cattle, and horſes, the only wealth of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, was reſerved for the uſe of the garriſons which Probus eſtabliſhed on the limits of their territory. He even entertained ſome thoughts of compelling the Germans to relinquiſh the exerciſe of arms, and to truſt their differences to the juſtice, their ſafety to the power, of Rome. To accompliſh theſe ſalutary ends, the conſtant reſidence of an Imperial governor, ſupported by a numerous army, was indiſpenſably requiſite. Probus therefore judged it more expedient to defer the execution of ſo grèat a deſign; which was indeed rather of ſpecious than ſolid utility <note n="40" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 238, 239. Vopiſcus quotes a letter from the emperor to the ſenate, in which he mentions his deſign of reducing Germany into a province.</note>. Had Germany been reduced into the ſtate of a province, the Romans, with immenſe labour and expence, would have acquired only a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive boundary to defend againſt the fiercer and more active barbarians of Scythia.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of reducing the warlike natives of <note place="margin">He builds a wall from the Rhine to the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube.</note> Germany to the condition of ſubjects, Probus contented himſelf with the humble expedient of raiſing a bulwark againſt their inroads. The country, which now forms the circle of Swabia,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0034700102:96"/>
had been left deſert in the age of Auguſtus by the emigration of its ancient inhabitants <note n="41" place="bottom">Strabo, l. vii. According to Velleius Paterculus (ii. 108.), Maroboduus led his Marcomanni into Bohemia: Cluverius (German. Antiq. iii. 8.) proves that it was from Swabia.</note>. The fertility of the ſoil ſoon attracted a new colony from the adjacent provinces of Gaul. Crowds of adventurers, of a roving temper and of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fortunes, occupied the doubtful poſſeſſion, and acknowledged, by the payment of tythes, the majeſty of the empire <note n="42" place="bottom">Theſe ſettlers from the payment of tythes were denominated, <hi>Decumates.</hi> Tacif. Germania, c. 29.</note>. To protect theſe new ſubjects, a line of frontier garriſons was gradually extended from the Rhine to the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube. About the reign of Hadrian, when that mode of defence began to be practiſed, theſe garriſons were connected and covered by a ſtrong intrenchment of trees and paliſades. In the place of ſo rude a bulwark, the emperor Probus conſtructed a ſtone-wall of a conſiderable height, and ſtrengthened it by towers at convenient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances. From the neighbourhood of Newſtadt and Ratiſbon on the Danube, it ſtretched acroſs hills, vallies, rivers, and moraſſes, as far as Wimpfen on the Necker, and at length termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated on the banks of the Rhine, after a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courſe of near two hundred miles <note n="43" place="bottom">See Notes de l'Abbe de la Bleterie à la Germanie de Tacite, p. 183. His account of the wall is chiefly borrowed (as he ſays himſelf) from the <hi>Alſatia Illuſtrata</hi> of Schoepflin.</note>. This important barrier, uniting the two mighty ſtreams that protected the provinces of Europe, ſeemed to fill up the vacant ſpace through which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0034700102:97"/>

The emperor diſperſed them through all the provinces, and diſtributed this dangerous reinforcement in ſmall bands of fifty or ſixty each, among the

Their aid was now become neceſſary. The feeble elegance of Italy and the internal provinces could no longer ſupport the weight of arms. The hardy frontier of the Rhine and Danube ſtill produced minds and bodies equal to the labours of the camp; but a perpetual ſeries of wars had gradually diminiſhed their numbers. The infrequency of marriage, and the ruin of agriculture, affected the principles of population, and not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the ſtrength of the preſent, but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the hope of future generations. The wiſdom of Probus embraced a great and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial plan of repleniſhing the exhauſted frontiers, by new colonies of captive or fugitive barbarians, on whom he beſtowed lands, cattle, inſtruments of huſbandry, and every encouragement that might engage them to educate a race of ſoldiers for the ſervice of the republic.

The impatience and idleneſs of the barbarians could ill brook the ſlow labours of agriculture. Their unconquerable love of freedom, riſing againſt deſpotiſm, provoked them into haſty rebellions, alike fatal to themſelves and to the provinces <note n="49" place="bottom">Hiſt.

For a ſhort ſeaſon they might wander in arms through the empire; but in the end they were ſurely deſtroyed by the power of a warlike emperor. The ſucceſsful raſhneſs of a party of Franks was attended, however, with ſuch memorable conſequences, that it ought not to be paſſed unnoticed. They had been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Probus, on the ſea-coaſt of Pontus, with a view of ſtrengthening the frontier againſt the inroads of the Alani. A fleet ſtationed in one of the harbours of the Euxine, fell into the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0034700102:100"/>
hands of the Franks; and they reſolved, through unknown ſeas, to explore their way from the mouth of the Phaſis to that of the Rhine. They eaſily eſcaped through the Boſphorus and the Helleſpont, and cruizing along the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, indulged their appetite for revenge and plunder, by frequent deſcents on the unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſhores of Aſia, Greece, and Africa. The opulent city of Syracuſe, in whoſe port the navies of Athens and Carthage had formerly been ſunk, was ſacked by a handful of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who maſſacred the greateſt part of the trembling inhabitants. From the iſland of Sicily, the Franks proceeded to the columns of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, truſted themſelves to the ocean, coaſted round Spain and Gaul, and ſteering their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant courſe through the Britiſh channel, at length finiſhed their ſurpriſing voyage, by land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſafety on the Batavian or Friſian ſhores <note n="50" place="bottom">Panegyr.

The example of their ſucceſs, inſtructing their countrymen to conceive the advantages, and to deſpiſe the dangers, of the ſea, pointed out to their enterpriſing ſpirit, a new road to wealth and glory.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the vigilance and activity of Probus, it was almoſt impoſſible that he could at <note place="margin">Revolt of Saturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in the Eaſt;</note> once contain in obedience every part of his wide-extended dominions. The barbarians, who broke their chains, had ſeized the favourable opportunity of a domeſtic war. When the emperor marched to the relief of Gaul, he devolved the command
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0034700102:101"/>
of the Eaſt on Saturninus. That general, a man of merit and experience, was driven into rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion by the abſence of his ſovereign, the levity of the Alexandrian people, the preſſing inſtances of his friends, and his own fears; but from the moment of his elevation, he never entertained a hope of empire, or even of life. <q>Alas! he ſaid, the republic has loſt a uſeful ſervant, and the raſhneſs of an hour has deſtroyed the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of many years. You know not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, the miſery of ſovereign power; a ſword is perpetually ſuſpended over our head. We dread our very guards, we diſtruſt our companions. The choice of action or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is no longer in our diſpoſition, nor is there any age, or character, or conduct, that can protect us from the cenſure of envy. In thus exalting me to the throne, you have doomed me to a life of cares, and to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fate. The only conſolation which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains is, the aſſurance that I ſhall not fall alone <note n="51" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 245, 246. The unfortunate ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had ſtudied rhetoric at Carthage, and was therefore more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a Moor (Zoſim. l. i. p. 60.) than a Gaul, as Vopiſcus calls him.</note>.</q> But as the former part of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was verified by the victory, ſo the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was diſappointed by the clemency of Probus. That amiable prince attempted even to ſave the unhappy Saturninus from the fury of the ſoldiers.

that he had puniſhed, as a malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, the firſt who related the improbable news of his defection <note n="52" place="bottom">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 638.</note>. Saturninus might, perhaps, have embraced the generous offer, had he not been reſtrained by the obſtinate diſtruſt of his adherents.

The moſt diſtinguiſhed merit of thoſe two officers was their reſpective proweſs, of the one in the combats of Bacchus, of the other in thoſe of Venus <note n="53" place="bottom">A very ſurpriſing inſtance is recorded of the proweſs of Proculus.

The arms of Probus had now ſuppreſſed all the foreign and domeſtic enemies of the ſtate. His mild but ſteady adminiſtration confirmed the <note place="margin">A. D. 281.</note> re-eſtabliſhment of the public tranquillity; nor <note place="margin">Triumph of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> was there left in the provinces a hoſtile barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, a tyrant, or even a robber, to revive the memory of paſt diſorders. It was time that the emperor ſhould reviſit Rome, and celebrate his own glory and the general happineſs. The triumph due to the valour of Probus was conducted with a magnificence ſuitable to his fortune, and the people who had ſo lately admired the trophies of Aurelian, gazed with equal pleaſure on thoſe of his heroic ſucceſſor <note n="55" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 240.</note>. We cannot, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, forget the deſperate courage of about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Gladiators, reſerved with near ſix hundred others, for the inhuman ſports of the amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre. Diſdaining to ſhed their blood for the amuſement of the populace, they killed their keepers, broke from the place of their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and filled the ſtreets of Rome with blood and confuſion. After an obſtinate reſiſtance, they were overpowered and cut in pieces by the regular forces; but they obtained at leaſt an honourable death, and the ſatisfaction of a juſt revenge <note n="56" place="bottom">Zoſim. l. i. p. 66.</note>.</p>
            <p>The military diſcipline which reigned in the <note place="margin">His diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> camps of Probus, was leſs cruel than that of Aurelian, but it was equally rigid and exact. The latter had puniſhed the irregularities of the ſoldiers with unrelenting ſeverity, the former
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0034700102:104"/>
prevented them by employing the legions in conſtant and uſeful labours. When Probus commanded in Egypt, he executed many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable works for the ſplendour and benefit of that rich country. The navigation of the Nile, ſo important to Rome itſelf, was improved; and temples, bridges, porticoes, and palaces, were conſtructed by the hands of the ſoldiers, who acted by turns as architects, as engineers, and as huſbandmen <note n="57" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 236.</note>. It was reported of Hannibal, that, in order to preſerve his troops from the dangerous temptations of idleneſs, he had oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to form large plantations of olive trees along the coaſt of Africa <note n="58" place="bottom">Aurel.

He left Africa when he was nine years old, returned to it when he was forty-five, and immediately loſt his army in the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive battle of Zama. Livius, xxx. 37.</note>. From a ſimilar principle, Probus exerciſed his legions in cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with rich vineyards, the hills of Gaul and Pannonia, and two conſiderable ſpots are deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which were entirely dug and planted by military labour <note n="59" place="bottom">Hiſt.

He revoked the prohibition of Domitian, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a general permiſſion of planting vines to the Gauls, the Britons, and the Pannonians.</note>. One of theſe, known under the name of Mount Almo, was ſituated near Sirmium, the country where Probus was born, for which he ever retained a partial affection, and whoſe gratitude he endeavoured to ſecure, by converting into tillage a large and unhealthy tract of marſhy ground. An army thus employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0034700102:105"/>
conſtituted perhaps the moſt uſeful, as well as the braveſt, portion of Roman ſubjects.</p>
            <p>But in the proſecution of a favourite ſcheme, the beſt of men, ſatisfied with the rectitude of <note place="margin">His death.</note> their intentions, are ſubject to forget the bounds of moderation; nor did Probus himſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conſult the patience and diſpoſition of his fierce legionaries <note n="60" place="bottom">Julian beſtows a ſevere, and indeed exceſſive, cenſure on the rigour of Probus, who, as he thinks, almoſt deſerved his fate.</note>.

The imprudence of Probus is ſaid to have inflamed the diſcontent of his troops. More at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the intereſts of mankind than to thoſe of the army, he expreſſed the vain hope, that, by the eſtabliſhment of univerſal peace, he ſhould ſoon aboliſh the neceſſity of a ſtanding and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary force <note n="61" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt.

In one of the hotteſt days of ſummer, as he ſeverely urged the unwholeſome labour of draining the marſhes of Sirmium, the ſoldiers, impatient of fatigue, on a ſudden threw down their tools, graſped their arms, and broke out into a furious mutiny.

            <p>When the legions had indulged their grief <note place="margin">Election and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Carus.</note> and repentance for the death of Probus, their unanimous conſent declared Carus, his Praetorian praefect, the moſt deſerving of the Imperial throne. Every circumſtance that relates to this prince appears of a mixed and doubtful nature. He gloried in the title of Roman Citizen; and affected to compare the purity of <hi>his</hi> blood, with the foreign and even barbarous origin of the preceding emperors; yet the moſt inquiſitive of his contemporaries, very far from admitting his claim, have variouſly deduced his own birth, or that of his parents, from Illyricum, from Gaul, or from Africa <note n="64" place="bottom">Yet all this may be conciliated. He was born at Narbonne in Illyricum, confounded by Eutropius with the more famous city of that name in Gaul. His father might be an African, and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a noble Roman. Carus himſelf was educated in the capital. See Scaliger, Animadverſion. ad Euſeb. Chron. p. 241.</note>. Though a ſoldier, he had received a learned education; though a ſenator, he was inveſted with the firſt dignity of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0034700102:107"/>
the army; and in an age, when the civil and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary profeſſions began to be irrecoverably ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from each other, they were united in the perſon of Carus. Notwithſtanding the ſevere juſtice which he exerciſed againſt the aſſaſſins of Probus, to whoſe favour and eſteem he was highly indebted, he could not eſcape the ſuſpicion of being acceſſary to a deed from whence he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the principal advantage. He enjoyed, at leaſt before his elevation, an acknowledged cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of virtue and abilities <note n="65" place="bottom">Probus had requeſted of the ſenate an equeſtrian ſtatue and a marble palace, at the public expence, as a juſt recompence of the ſingular merit of Carus.

himſelf with announcing, in a cold and ſtately epiſtle, that he had aſcended the vacant throne <note n="68" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 249.

The voice of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and flattery was not however ſilent; and we may ſtill peruſe, with pleaſure and contempt, an eclogue, which was compoſed on the acceſſion of the emperor Carus.

Before his departure for this diſtant expedition, Carus conferred on his two

ſons, Carinus and Numerian, the title of Caeſar, and inveſting the former with almoſt an equal ſhare of the Imperial power, directed the young prince, firſt to ſuppreſs ſome troubles which had ariſen in Gaul, and afterwards to fix the ſeat of his reſidence at Rome, and to aſſume the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the weſtern provinces <note n="71" place="bottom">Hiſt.

The darkneſs which overſpread the ſky was ſo thick, that we could no longer diſtinguiſh each other; and the inceſſant flaſhes of lightning took from us the knowledge of all that paſſed in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral confuſion. Immediately after the moſt violent clap of thunder, we heard a ſudden cry, that the emperor was dead; and it ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that his chamberlains, in a rage of grief, had ſet fire to the royal pavillion, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which gave riſe to the report that Carus was killed by lightning. But, as far as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0034700102:112"/>
we have been able to inveſtigate the truth, his death was the natural effect of his diſorder <note n="76" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 250.

The public expected that the ſucceſſor of Carus would purſue his father's foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, and without allowing the Perſians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from their conſternation, would advance ſword in hand to the palaces of Suſa and Ecba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana <note n="77" place="bottom">See Nemeſian.

            <p>The intelligence of the myſterious fate of the <note place="margin">A. D. 384. Vices of Carinus.</note> late emperor, was ſoon carried from the frontiers of Perſia to Rome; and the ſenate, as well as the provinces, congratulated the acceſſion of the ſons of Carus. Theſe fortunate youths were ſtrangers, however, to that conſcious ſuperiority, either of birth or of merit, which can alone render the poſſeſſion of a throne eaſy, and as it were natural. Born and educated in a private ſtation, the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their father raiſed them at once to the rank of princes; and his death, which happened about ſixteen months afterwards, left them the unexpected legacy of a vaſt empire. To ſuſtain with temper this rapid elevation, an uncommon ſhare of virtue and prudence was requiſite; and Carinus, the elder of the brothers, was more than commonly deficient in thoſe qualities. In the Gallic war, he diſcovered ſome degree of perſonal courage <note n="80" place="bottom">Nemeſian. Cynegeticon, v. 69. He was a contemporary, but a poet.</note>; but from the moment of his arrival at Rome, he abandoned himſelf to the luxury of the capital, and to the abuſe of his fortune. He was ſoft yet cruel; devoted to pleaſure, but deſtitute of taſte; and though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely ſuſceptible of vanity, indifferent to the public eſteem. In the courſe of a few months,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0034700102:114"/>
he ſucceſſively married and divorced nine wives, moſt of whom he left pregnant; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this legal inconſtancy, found time to indulge ſuch a variety of irregular appetites, as brought diſhonour on himſelf and on the nobleſt houſes of Rome. He beheld with inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred all thoſe who might remember his former obſcurity, or cenſure his preſent conduct. He baniſhed, or put to death, the friends and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors whom his father had placed about him, to guide his inexperienced youth; and he perſecuted with the meaneſt revenge his ſchool-fellows and companions, who had not ſufficiently reſpected the latent majeſty of the emperor. With the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, Carinus affected a lofty and regal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, frequently declaring, that he deſigned to diſtribute their eſtates among the populace of Rome. From the dregs of that populace, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his favourites, and even his miniſters. The palace, and even the Imperial table, was filled with ſingers, dancers, proſtitutes, and all the various retinue of vice and folly. One of his door-keepers <note n="81" place="bottom">

In the room of the Praetorian praefect, whom he put to death, Carinus ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted one of the miniſters of his looſer pleaſures. Another who poſſeſſed the ſame, or even a more infamous, title to favour, was inveſted with the conſulſhip. A confidential ſecretary, who had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0034700102:115"/>
acquired uncommon ſkill in the art of forgery, delivered the indolent emperor, with his own conſent, from the irkſome duty of ſigning his name.</p>
            <p>When the emperor Carus undertook the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian war, he was induced, by motives of affection as well as policy, to ſecure the fortunes of his family, by leaving in the hands of his eldeſt ſon the armies and provinces of the Weſt. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence which he ſoon received of the conduct of Carinus, filled him with ſhame and regret; nor had he concealed his reſolution of ſatisfying the republic by a ſevere act of juſtice, and of adopting, in the place of an unworthy ſon, the brave and virtuous Conſtantius, who at that time was governor of Dalmatia. But the elevation of Conſtantius was for a while deferred; and as ſoon as the father's death had releaſed Carinus from the controul of fear or decency, he diſplayed to the Romans the extravagancies of Elagabalus, aggravated by the cruelty of Domitian <note n="82" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 253, 254. Eutropius, ix. 19. Victor Junior. The reign of Diocletian indeed was ſo long and proſperous, that it muſt have been very unfavourable to the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Carinus.</note>.</p>
            <p>The only merit of the adminiſtration of Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus that hiſtory could record or poetry celebrate, <note place="margin">He cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates the Roman games.</note> was the uncommon ſplendour with which, in his own and his brother's name, he exhibited the Roman games of the theatre, the circus, and the amphitheatre.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0034700102:116"/>

Auguſt. p. 254. He calls him Carus, but the ſenſe is ſufficiently obvious, and the words were often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</note>. But this vain prodigality, which the prudence of Diocletian might juſtly deſpiſe, was enjoyed with ſurpriſe and tranſport by the Roman people. The oldeſt of the citizens, recollecting the ſpectacles of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer days, the triumphal pomp of Probus or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian, and the ſecular games of the emperor Philip, acknowledged that they were all ſurpaſſed by the ſuperior magnificence of Carinus <note n="84" place="bottom">See Calphurnius, Eclog. vii. 43. We may obſerve, that the ſpectacles of Probus were ſtill recent, and that the poet is ſeconded by the hiſtorian.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ſpectacles of Carinus may therefore be <note place="margin">Spectacles of Rome.</note> beſt illuſtrated by the obſervation of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which hiſtory has condeſcended to relate concerning thoſe of his predeceſſors. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ourſelves ſolely to the hunting of wild beaſts, however we may cenſure the vanity of the deſign or the cruelty of the execution, we are obliged to confeſs, that neither before nor ſince the time of the Romans, ſo much art and expence have ever been laviſhed for the amuſement of the people <note n="85" place="bottom">The philoſopher Montaigne (Eſſais, l. iii. 6.) gives a very juſt and lively view of Roman magnificence in theſe ſpectacles.</note>. By the order of Probus, a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of large trees, torn up by the roots, were tranſplanted into the midſt of the circus. The ſpacious and ſhady foreſt was immediately filled with a thouſand oſtriches, a thouſand ſtags, a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0034700102:117"/>
thouſand fallow deer, and a thouſand wild boars; and all this variety of game was abandoned to the riotous impetuoſity of the multitude. The tragedy of the ſucceeding day conſiſted in the maſſacre of an hundred lions, an equal number of lioneſſes, two hundred leopards, and three hundred bears <note n="86" place="bottom">Vopiſcus in Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 240.</note>. The collection prepared by the younger Gordian for his triumph, and which his ſucceſſor exhibited in the ſecular games, was leſs remarkable by the number than by the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the animals. Twenty zebras diſplayed their elegant forms and variegated beauty to the eyes of the Roman people <note n="87" place="bottom">They are called <hi>Onagri;</hi> but the number is too inconſiderable for mere wild-aſſes. Cuper (de Elephantis Exercitat. ii. 7.) has proved from Oppian, Dion, and an anonymous Greek, that zebras had been ſeen at Rome. They were brought from ſome iſland of the ocean, perhaps Madagaſcar.</note>. Ten elks, and as many camelopards, the loftieſt and moſt harmleſs creatures that wander over the plains of Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia and Aethiopia, were contraſted with thirty African hyaenas, and ten Indian tygers, the moſt implacable ſavages of the torrid zone.

the ſplendid ſhow, the naturaliſt might indeed obſerve the figure and properties of ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies, tranſported from every part of the ancient world into the amphitheatre of Rome. But this accidental benefit, which ſcience might derive from folly, is ſurely inſufficient to juſtify ſuch a wanton abuſe of the public riches. There occurs, however, a ſingle inſtance in the firſt Punic war, in which the ſenate wiſely connected this amuſement of the multitude with the intereſt of the ſtate. A conſiderable number of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, taken in the defeat of the Carthaginian army, were driven through the circus by a few ſlaves, armed only with blunt javelins <note n="90" place="bottom">Plin.

It is uncertain whether they intended to divide between them the adminiſtration, or the provinces, of the empire; but it is very unlikely that their union would have proved of any long duration. The jealouſy of power muſt have been inflamed by the oppoſition of characters. In the moſt corrupt of times, Carinus was unworthy to live: Numerian deſerved to reign in a happier period. His affable manners and gentle virtues ſecured him, as ſoon as they became known, the regard and affections of the public. He poſſeſſed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0034700102:122"/>
the elegant accompliſhments of a poet and orator, which dignify as well as adorn the humbleſt and the moſt exalted ſtation. His eloquence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was applauded by the ſenate, was formed not ſo much on the model of Cicero, as on that of the modern declaimers; but in an age very far from being deſtitute of poetical merit, he contended for the prize with the moſt celebrated of his contemporaries, and ſtill remained the friend of his rivals; a circumſtance which evinces either the goodneſs of his heart, or the ſuperiority of his genius <note n="101" place="bottom">He won all the crowns from Nemeſianus, with whom he vied in didactic poetry.

But the talents of Numerian were rather of the contemplative, than of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive kind. When his father's elevation reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly forced him from the ſhade of retirement, neither his temper nor his purſuits had qualified him for the command of armies. His conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was deſtroyed by the hardſhips of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian war; and he had contracted, from the heat of the climate <note n="102" place="bottom">A more natural cauſe, at leaſt, than that aſſigned by Vopiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus (Hiſt.

The adminiſtration of all affairs, civil as well as military, was devolved on Arrius Aper, the Praetorian praefect, who, to the power of his important office, added the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing father-in-law to Numerian.

            <p>It was not till eight months after the death of <note place="margin">Death of Numerian.</note> Carus, that the Roman army, returning by ſlow marches from the banks of the Tigris, arrived on thoſe of the Thracian Boſphorus.

occaſion of his ruin. Yet, even in the tranſport of their rage and grief, the troops obſerved a regular proceeding, which proves how firmly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline had been re-eſtabliſhed by the martial ſucceſſors of Gallienus. A general aſſembly of the army was appointed to be held at Chalcedon, whither Aper was tranſported in chains, as a priſoner and a criminal. A vacant tribunal was erected in the midſt of the camp, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and tribunes formed a great military council.

The future fortunes of the candidate depended on the chance or conduct of the preſent hour.

The moſt faithful ſervants of the father deſpiſed the incapacity, and dreaded the cruel arrogance, of the ſon. The hearts of the people were engaged in favour of his rival, and even the ſenate was inclined to prefer an uſurper to a tyrant. The arts of Diocletian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed the general diſcontent; and the winter was employed in ſecret intrigues, and open pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for a civil war.

            <p>AS the reign of Diocletian was more illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious than that of any of his predeceſſors, ſo was his birth more abject and obſcure. <note place="margin">Elevation and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Diocleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> The ſtrong claims of merit and of violence had frequently ſuperſeded the ideal prerogatives of nobility; but a diſtinct line of ſeparation was <note place="margin">A. D. 285.</note> hitherto preſerved between the free and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile part of mankind. The parents of Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian had been ſlaves in the houſe of Anulinus, a Roman ſenator; nor was he himſelf diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by any other name, than that which he derived from a ſmall town in Dalmatia, from whence his mother deduced her origin <note n="1" place="bottom">Eutrop. ix. 19. Victor in Epitom. The town ſeems to have been properly called Doclia, from a ſmall tribe of Illyrians (ſee Cellarius, Geograph. Antiqua, tom. i. p. 393.); and the original name of the fortunate ſlave was probably Docles; he firſt length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened it to the Grecian harmony of Diocles, and at length to the Roman majeſty of Diocletianus. He likewiſe aſſumed the Patrician name of Valerius, and it is uſually given him by Aurelius Victor.</note>. It is, however, probable, that his father obtained the freedom of the family, and that he ſoon acquired an office of ſcribe, which was commonly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed

Favourable oracles, or rather the conſciouſneſs of ſuperior merit, prompted his aſpiring ſon to purſue the profeſſion of arms and the hopes of fortune; and it would be extremely curious to obſerve the gradation of arts and accidents which enabled him in the end to fulfil thoſe oracles, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play that merit to the world. Diocletian was ſucceſſively promoted to the government of Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, the honours of the conſulſhip, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant command of the guards of the palace. He diſtinguiſhed his abilities in the Perſian war; and, after the death of Numerian, the ſlave, by the confeſſion and judgment of his rivals, was declared the moſt worthy of the Imperial throne. The malice of religious zeal, whilſt it arraigns the ſavage fierceneſs of his colleague Maximian, has affected to caſt ſuſpicions on the perſonal courage of the emperor Diocletian <note n="3" place="bottom">Lactantius (or whoever was the author of the little treatiſe De Mortibus Perſecutorum) accuſes Diocletian of <hi>timidity</hi> in two places, c. 7, 8. In chap. 9, he ſays of him, "erat in omni tumultu meti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culoſus et animi disjectus."</note>. It would not be eaſy to perſuade us of the cowardice of a ſoldier of fortune, who acquired and preſerved the eſteem of the legions, as well as the favour of ſo many warlike princes. Yet even calumny is ſagacious enough to diſcover and to attack the moſt vulnerable part. The valour of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian was never found inadequate to his duty or to the occaſion; but he appears not to have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0034700102:129"/>
poſſeſſed the daring and generous ſpirit of a hero, who courts danger and fame, diſdains artifice, and boldly challenges the allegiance of his equals. His abilities were uſeful rather than ſplendid; a vigorous mind, improved by the experience and ſtudy of mankind; dexterity and application in buſineſs; a judicious mixture of liberality and oeconomy, of mildneſs and rigour; profound diſſimulation under the diſguiſe of military frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſteadineſs to purſue his ends; flexibility to vary his means; and above all, the great art of ſubmitting his own paſſions, as well as thoſe of others, to the intereſt of his ambition, and of colouring his ambition with the moſt ſpecious pretences of juſtice and public utility. Like Auguſtus, Diocletian may be conſidered as the founder of a new empire. Like the adopted ſon of Caeſar, he was diſtinguiſhed as a ſtateſman rather than as a warrior; nor did either of thoſe princes employ force, whenever their purpoſe could be effected by policy.</p>
            <p>The victory of Diocletian was remarkable for <note place="margin">His cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and victory.</note> its ſingular mildneſs. A people accuſtomed to applaud the clemency of the conqueror, if the uſual puniſhments of death, exile, and confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were inflicted with any degree of temper and equity, beheld, with the moſt pleaſing aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, a civil war, the flames of which were extinguiſhed in the field of battle. Diocletian received into his confidence Ariſtobulus, the principal miniſter of the houſe of Carus, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lives, the fortunes, and the dignity of his adverſaries, and even continued in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0034700102:130"/>
ſtations the greater number of the ſervants of Carinus <note n="4" place="bottom">In this encomium, Aurelius Victor ſeems to convey a juſt, though indirect, cenſure of the cruelty of Conſtantius. It appears from the Faſti, that Ariſtobulus remained praefect of the city, and that he ended with Diocletian, the conſulſhip which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced with Carinus.</note>. It is not improbable that motives of prudence might aſſiſt the humanity of the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Dalmatian; of theſe ſervants, many had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed his favour by ſecret treachery; in others, he eſteemed their grateful fidelity to an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate maſter. The diſcerning judgment of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian, of Probus, and of Carus, had filled the ſeveral departments of the ſtate and army with officers of approved merit, whoſe removal would have injured the public ſervice, without promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intereſt of the ſucceſſor. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, however, diſplayed to the Roman world the faireſt proſpect of the new reign, and the emperor affected to confirm this favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, by declaring, that, among all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of his predeceſſors, he was the moſt ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of imitating the humane philoſophy of Marcus Antoninus <note n="5" place="bottom">Aurelius Victor ſtyles Diocletian, "Parentem potius quam Dominum." See Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 30.</note>.</p>
            <p>The firſt conſiderable action of his reign ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and character of Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian.</note> to evince his ſincerity as well as his modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After the example of Marcus, he gave himſelf a colleague in the perſon of Maximian, <note place="margin">A. D 286. April 1.</note> on whom he beſtowed at firſt the title of Caeſar, and afterwards that of Auguſtus <note n="6" place="bottom">The queſtion of the time when Maximian received the honours of Caeſar and Auguſtus has divided modern critics, and given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a great deal of learned wrangling. I have followed M. de Tillemont (Hiſtoire des Empereurs, tom, iv. p. 500—505.), who has weighed the ſeveral reaſons and difficulties with his ſcrupulous accuracy.</note>. But the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0034700102:131"/>
motives of his conduct, as well as the object of his choice, were of a very different nature from thoſe of his admired predeceſſor. By inveſting a luxurious youth with the honours of the purple, Marcus had diſcharged a debt of private grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, at the expence, indeed, of the happineſs of the ſtate. By aſſociating a friend and a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſoldier to the labours of government, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian, in a time of public danger, provided for the defence both of the Eaſt and of the Weſt. Maximian was born a peaſant, and, like Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, in the territory of Sirmium. Ignorant of letters <note n="7" place="bottom">In an oration delivered before him (Panegyr. Vet. ii. 8.), Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mertinus expreſſes a doubt whether his hero, in imitating the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Hannibal and Scipio, had ever heard of their names. From thence we may fairly infer, that Maximian was more deſirous of being conſidered as a ſoldier than as a man of letters: and it is in this manner that we can often tranſlate the language of flattery into that of truth.</note>, careleſs of laws, the ruſticity of his appearance and manners ſtill betrayed in the moſt elevated fortune the meanneſs of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. War was the only art which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. In a long courſe of ſervice he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed himſelf on every frontier of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and though his military talents were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obey rather than to command, though, perhaps, he never attained the ſkill of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate general, he was capable, by his valour, conſtancy, and experience, of executing the moſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0034700102:132"/>
arduous undertakings. Nor were the vices of Maximian leſs uſeful to his benefactor. Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pity, and fearleſs of conſequences, he was the ready inſtrument of every act of cruelty which the policy of that artful prince might at once ſuggeſt and diſclaim. As ſoon as a bloody ſacrifice had been offered to prudence or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Diocletian, by his ſeaſonable interceſſion, ſaved the remaining few whom he had never deſigned to puniſh, gently cenſured the ſeverity of his ſtern colleague, and enjoyed the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of a golden and an iron age, which was univerſally applied to their oppoſite maxims of government. Notwithſtanding the difference of their characters, the two emperors maintained, on the throne, that friendſhip which they had contracted in a private ſtation. The haughty turbulent ſpirit of Maximian, ſo fatal afterwards to himſelf and to the public peace, was accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to reſpect the genius of Diocletian, and confeſſed the aſcendant of reaſon over brutal violence <note n="8" place="bottom">Lactantius de M. P. c. 8. Aurelius Victor. As among the Panegyrics, we find orations pronounced in praiſe of Maximian, and others which flatter his adverſaries at his expence, we derive ſome knowledge from the contraſt.</note>. From a motive either of pride or ſuperſtition, the two emperors aſſumed the titles, the one of Jovius, the other of Herculius. Whilſt the motion of the world (ſuch was the language of their venal orators) was maintained by the all-ſeeing wiſdom of Jupiter, the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible

            <p>But even the omnipotence of Jovius and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culius <note place="margin">Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars.</note> was inſufficient to ſuſtain the weight of the public adminiſtration.

With this view he reſolved once more to divide his unwieldy power, and with the inferior title of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> to confer on two generals of approved merit an equal ſhare of the ſovereign authority <note n="10" place="bottom">Aurelius Victor.

Any remarkable degree of pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeems inconſiſtent with the <hi>rubor</hi> mentioned in Panegyric, v. 19.</note>, were the two perſons inveſted with the ſecond honours of the Imperial purple. In deſcribing the country, extraction, and manners of Herculius, we have already delineated thoſe of Galerius, who was often, and not improperly, ſtyled the younger Maximian, though, in many inſtances both of virtue and ability, he appears to have poſſeſſed a manifeſt ſuperiority over the elder. The birth of Conſtantius was leſs obſcure
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0034700102:134"/>
than that of his colleagues. Eutropius, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was one of the moſt conſiderable nobles of Dardania, and his mother was the niece of the emperor Claudius <note n="12" place="bottom">Julian, the grandſon of Conſtantius, boaſts that his family was derived from the warlike Maeſians. Miſopogon, p. 348. The Dardanians dwelt on the edge of Maeſia.</note>. Although the youth of Conſtantius had been ſpent in arms, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a mild and amiable diſpoſition, and the popular voice had long ſince acknowledged him worthy of the rank which he at laſt attained. To ſtrengthen the bonds of political, by thoſe of domeſtic union, each of the emperors aſſumed the character of a father to one of the Caeſars, Diocletian to Galerius, and Maximian to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius; and each obliging them to repudiate their former wives, beſtowed his daughter in marriage on his adopted ſon <note n="13" place="bottom">Galerius married Valeria, the daughter of Diocletian; if we ſpeak with ſtrictneſs, Theodora, the wife of Conſtantius, was daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only to the wife of Maximian.

Italy and Africa were conſidered as the department of Maximian; and for his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar portion, Diocletian reſerved Thrace, Egypt, and the rich countries of Aſia.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0034700102:135"/>
united authority extended over the whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and each of them was prepared to aſſiſt his colleagues with his counſels or preſence. The Caeſars, in their exalted rank, revered the majeſty of the emperors, and the three younger princes invariably acknowledged, by their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and obedience, the common parent of their fortunes. The ſuſpicious jealouſy of power found not any place among them; and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular happineſs of their union has been compared to a chorus of muſic, whoſe harmony was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and maintained by the ſkilful hand of the firſt artiſt <note n="15" place="bottom">Julian in Caeſarib. p. 315.

            <p>This important meaſure was not carried into <note place="margin">Series of events.</note> execution till about ſix years after the aſſociation of Maximian, and that interval of time had not been deſtitute of memorable incidents. But we have preferred, for the ſake of perſpicuity, firſt to deſcribe the more perfect form of Diocletian's government, and afterwards to relate the actions of his reign, following rather the natural order of the events, than the dates of a very doubtful chronology.</p>

He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the peaſants of Gaul, who, under the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0034700102:136"/>
appellation of Bagaudae <note n="16" place="bottom">The general name of <hi>Bagaudae</hi> (in the ſignification of Rebels) continued till the fifth century in Gaul. Some critics derive it from a Celtic word <hi>Bagad,</hi> a tumultuous aſſembly. Scaliger ad Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb.

The <hi>nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veté</hi> of his ſtory is loſt in our beſt modern writers.</note>. It ſhould ſeem, that very many of thoſe inſtitutions, referred by an eaſy ſolution to the feudal ſyſtem, are derived from the Celtic barbarians. When Caeſar ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Gauls, that great nation was already divided into three orders of men; the clergy, the nobility, and the common people. The firſt governed by ſuperſtition, the ſecond by arms, but the third and laſt was not of any weight or account in their public councils. It was very natural for the Plebeians, oppreſſed by debt, or apprehenſive of injuries, to implore the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome powerful chief, who acquired over their perſons and property, the ſame abſolute rights as, among the Greeks and Romans, a maſter exerciſed over his ſlaves <note n="18" place="bottom">Caeſar de Bell. Gallic. vi. 13. Orgetorix, the Helvetian, could arm for his defence a body of ten thouſand ſlaves.</note>. The greateſt part of the nation was gradually reduced into a ſtate of ſervitude; compelled to perpetual labour on the eſtates of the Gallic nobles, and confined to the ſoil, either by the real weight of fetters, or by the no leſs cruel and forcible reſtraints of the laws. During the long ſeries of troubles which agitated Gaul, from the reign of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0034700102:137"/>
to that of Diocletian, the condition of theſe ſervile peaſants was peculiarly miſerable; and they experienced at once the complicated tyranny of their maſters, of the barbarians, of the ſoldiers, and of the officers of the revenue <note n="19" place="bottom">Their oppreſſion and miſery are acknowledged by Eumenius (Panegyr. vi. 8.), Gallias efferatus injuriis.</note>.</p>
            <p>Their patience was at laſt provoked into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. <note place="margin">Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</note> On every ſide they roſe in multitudes, armed with ruſtic weapons, and with irreſiſtible fury.

Vet. ii. 4. Aurelius Victor.</note>. They aſſerted the natural rights of men, but they aſſerted thoſe rights with the moſt ſavage cruelty. The Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic nobles juſtly dreading their revenge, either took refuge in the fortified cities, or fled from the wild ſeene of anarchy. The peaſants reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without controul; and two of their moſt daring leaders had the folly and raſhneſs to aſſume the Imperial ornaments <note n="21" place="bottom">Aelianus and Amandus. We have medals coined by them. Goltzius in Theſ. R. A. p. 117. 121.</note>. Their power ſoon expired at the approach of the legions.

habitations, and their unſucceſsful effort for freedom ſerved only to confirm their ſlavery. So ſtrong and uniform is the current of popular paſſions, that we might almoſt venture, from very ſcanty materials, to relate the particulars of this war; but we are not diſpoſed to believe that the principal leaders Aelianus and Amandus were Chriſtians <note n="23" place="bottom">The fact reſts indeed on very ſlight authority, a life of St. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolinus, which is probably of the ſeventh century.

            <p>Maximian had no ſooner recovered Gaul from <note place="margin">A.

Ever ſince the raſh but ſucceſsful enterpriſe of the Franks under the reign of Probus, their daring countrymen had conſtructed ſquadrons of light brigantines, in which they inceſſantly ravaged the provinces adjacent to the ocean <note n="24" place="bottom">Aurelius Victor calls them Germans.

To repel their deſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory incurſions, it was found neceſſary to create a naval power; and the judicious meaſure was proſecuted with prudence and vigour.

Dr. Stukely, however, (Hiſt. of Carauſius, p. 62.) chuſes to make him a native of St. David's, and a prince of the blood royal of Britain. The former idea he had found in Richard of Cirenceſter, p. 44.</note>, but who had long ſignalized his ſkill as a pilot, and his valour as a ſoldier. The integrity of the new admiral correſponded not with his abilities. When the German pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſailed from their own harbours, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at their paſſage, but he diligently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted their return, and appropriated to his own uſe an ample ſhare of the ſpoil which they had acquired. The wealth of Carauſius was, on this occaſion, very juſtly conſidered as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his guilt; and Maximian had already given orders for his death. But the crafty Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napian foreſaw and prevented the ſeverity of the emperor. By his liberality he had attached to his fortunes the fleet which he commanded, and ſecured the barbarians in his intereſt. From the port of Boulogne he ſailed over to Britain, perſuaded the legion, and the auxiliaries which guarded that iſland, to embrace his party, and boldly aſſuming, with the Imperial purple, the title of Auguſtus, defied the juſtice and the arms of his injured ſovereign <note n="26" place="bottom">Panegyr. v. 12.

            <p>When Britain was thus diſmembered from the <note place="margin">Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Britain.</note> empire, its importance was ſenſibly felt, and its loſs ſincerely lamented. The Romans celebrated,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0034700102:140"/>
and perhaps magnified, the extent of that noble iſland, provided on every ſide with convenient harbours; the temperature of the climate, and the fertility of the ſoil, alike adapted for the production of corn or of vines; the valuable minerals with which it abounded; its rich paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures covered with innumerable flocks, and its woods free from wild beaſts or venomous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. Above all, they regretted the large amount of the revenue of Britain, whilſt they confeſſed, that ſuch a province well deſerved to become the ſeat of an independent monarchy <note n="27" place="bottom">Panegyr.

During the ſpace of ſeven years, it was poſſeſſed <note place="margin">Power of Carauſius,</note> by Carauſius; and fortune continued propitious to a rebellion, ſupported with courage and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Britiſh emperor defended the frontiers of his dominions againſt the Caledonians of the North, invited, from the continent, a great number of ſkilful artiſts, and diſplayed, on a variety of coins that are ſtill extant, his taſte and opulence. Born on the confines of the Franks, he courted the friendſhip of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable people, by the flattering imitation of their dreſs and manners.

of military and naval arts. Carauſius ſtill preſerved the poſſeſſion of Boulogne and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent country. His fleets rode triumphant in the channel, commanded the mouths of the Seine and of the Rhine, ravaged the coaſts of the ocean, and diffuſed beyond the columns of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules the terror of his name. Under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Britain, deſtined in a future age to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the empire of the ſea, already aſſumed its natural and reſpectable ſtation of a maritime power <note n="28" place="bottom">As a great number of medals of Carauſius are ſtill preſerved, he is become a very favourite object of antiquarian curioſity, and every circumſtance of his life and actions has been inveſtigated with ſagacious accuracy.

            <p>By ſeizing the fleet of Boulogne, Carauſius had deprived his maſter of the means of purſuit <note place="margin">A.

But the adoption of the two Caeſars reſtored new vigour to the Roman arms; and while the Rhine was guarded by the preſence of Maximian, his brave aſſociate Conſtantius aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conduct of the Britiſh war. His firſt enterpriſe was againſt the important place of Boulogne. A ſtupendous mole, raiſed acroſs the entrance of the harbour, intercepted all hopes of relief. The town ſurrendered after an obſtinate <note place="margin">A. D. 292.</note> defence; and a conſiderable part of the naval ſtrength of Carauſius fell into the hands of the beſiegers. During the three years which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius employed in preparing a fleet adequate to the conqueſt of Britain, he ſecured the coaſt of Gaul, invaded the country of the Franks, and deprived the uſurper of the aſſiſtance of thoſe powerful allies.</p>
            <p>Before the preparations were finiſhed, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius <note place="margin">A.

The ſervants of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauſius imitated the example of treaſon, which he had given. He was murdered by his firſt miniſter Alectus, and the aſſaſſin ſucceeded to his power and to his danger. But he poſſeſſed not equal abilities either to exerciſe the one, or to repel the other. He beheld, with anxious terror, the oppoſite ſhores of the continent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready filled with arms, with troops, and with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0034700102:143"/>
veſſels; for Conſtantius had very prudently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his forces, that he might likewiſe divide the attention and reſiſtance of the enemy. The attack was at length made by the principal ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, <note place="margin">A.

So imperfect in thoſe times was the art of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that orators have celebrated the daring courage of the Romans, who ventured to ſet ſail with a ſide-wind, and on a ſtormy day. The weather proved favourable to their enterpriſe. Under the cover of a thick fog, they eſcaped the fleet of Alectus, which had been ſtationed off the Iſle of Wight to receive them, landed in ſafety on ſome part of the weſtern coaſt, and convinced the Britons, that a ſuperiority of naval ſtrength will not always protect their country from a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign invaſion. Aſclepiodatus had no ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embarked the Imperial troops, than he ſet fire to his ſhips; and, as the expedition proved for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, his heroic conduct was univerſally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. The uſurper had poſted himſelf near London, to expect the formidable attack of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius, who commanded in perſon the fleet of Boulogne; but the deſcent of a new enemy required his immediate preſence in the Weſt. He performed this long march in ſo precipitate a manner, that he encountered the whole force of the praefect with a ſmall body of haraſſed and diſheartened troops. The engagement was ſoon terminated by the total defeat and death of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0034700102:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Allectus; a ſingle battle, as it has often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, decided the fate of this great iſland; and when Conſtantius landed on the ſhores of Kent, he found them covered with obedient ſubjects. Their acclamations were loud and unanimous; and the virtues of the conqueror may induce us to believe, that they ſincerely rejoiced in a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which, after a ſeparation of ten years, reſtored Britain to the body of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire <note n="31" place="bottom">With regard to the recovery of Britain, we obtain a few hints from Aurelius Victor and Eutropius.</note>.</p>
            <p>Britain had none but domeſtic enemies to <note place="margin">Defence of the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</note> dread; and as long as the governors preſerved their fidelity, and the troops their diſcipline, the incurſions of the naked ſavages of Scotland or Ireland could never materially affect the ſafety of the province. The peace of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and the defence of the principal rivers which bounded the empire, were objects of far greater difficulty and importance. The policy of Diocletian, which inſpired the councils of his aſſociates, provided for the public tranquillity, by encouraging a ſpirit of diſſention among the barbarians, and by ſtrengthening the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Roman limit. In the Eaſt he fixed <note place="margin">Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> a line of camps of Egypt to the Perſian domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and, for every camp, he inſtituted an adequate number of ſtationary troops, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their reſpective officers, and ſupplied with every kind of arms, from the new arſenals which he had formed at Antioch, Emeſa, and Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus <note n="32" place="bottom">John Malela, in Chron.

Nor was the precaution of the emperor leſs watchful againſt the well-known valour of the barbarians of Europe. From the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube, the ancient camps, towns, and citadels, were diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed, and, in the moſt expoſed places, new ones were ſkilfully conſtructed; the ſtricteſt vigilance was introduced among the garriſons of the frontier, and every expedient was practiſed that could render the long chain of fortifications firm and impenetrable <note n="33" place="bottom">Zoſim. l. i. p. 3.

Panegyr. Vet. iv. 18.</note>. A barrier ſo reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able was ſeldom violated, and the barbarians often turned againſt each other their diſappointed rage. The Goths, the Vandals, the Gepidae, <note place="margin">Diſſentions of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</note> the Burgundians, the Alemanni, waſted each others ſtrength by deſtructive hoſtilities, and whoſoever vanquiſhed, they vanquiſhed the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Rome.

            <p>Notwithſtanding the policy of Diocletian, it was impoſſible to maintain an equal and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed <note place="margin">Conduct of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</note> tranquillity during a reign of twenty
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0034700102:146"/>
years, and along a frontier of many hundred miles. Sometimes the barbarians ſuſpended their domeſtic animoſities, and the relaxed vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the garriſons ſometimes gave a paſſage to their ſtrength or dexterity. Whenever the provinces were invaded, Diocletian conducted himſelf with that calm dignity which he always affected or poſſeſſed; reſerved his preſence for ſuch occaſions as were worthy of his interpoſition, never expoſed his perſon or reputation to any unneceſſary danger, enſured his ſucceſs by every means that prudence could ſuggeſt, and diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with oſtentation, the conſequences of his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. In wars of a more difficult nature, and more doubtful event, he employed the rough valour of Maximian, and that faithful ſoldier was content to aſcribe his own victories to the wiſe counſels and auſpicious influence of his benefactor. But after the adoption of the two Caeſars, the emperors themſelves retiring to a <note place="margin">Valour of the Caeſars.</note> leſs laborious ſcene of action, devolved on their adopted ſons the defence of the Danube and of the Rhine. The vigilant Galerius was never reduced to the neceſſity of vanquiſhing an army of barbarians on the Roman territory <note n="35" place="bottom">He complained, though not with the ſtricteſt truth; "Jam fluxiſſe annos quindecim in quibus, in Illyrico, ad ripam Danubii relegatus cum gentibus barbaris luctaret."

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0034700102:147"/>
have been actions of conſiderable danger and merit. As he traverſed the open country with a feeble guard, he was encompaſſed on a ſudden by the ſuperior multitude of the enemy. He retreated with difficulty towards Langres; but, in the general conſternation, the citizens refuſed to open their gates, and the wounded prince was drawn up the wall by the means of a rope. But on the news of his diſtreſs, the Roman troops haſtened from all ſides to his relief, and before the evening he had ſatisfied his honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge by the ſlaughter of ſix thouſand Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni <note n="36" place="bottom">In the Greek text of Euſebius, we read ſix thouſand, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which I have preferred to the ſixty thouſand of Jerome, Oroſius, Eutropius, and his Greek tranſlator Paeanius.</note>.

            <p>The conduct which the emperor Probus had <note place="margin">Treatment of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</note> adopted in the diſpoſal of the vanquiſhed, was imitated by Diocletian and his aſſociates. The captive barbarians, exchanging death for ſlavery, were diſtributed among the provincials, and aſſigned to thoſe diſtricts (in Gaul, the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of Amiens, Beauvais, Cambray, Treves, Langres, and Troyes, are particularly ſpecified <note n="37" place="bottom">Panegyr.

Nor did the emperors refuſe the property of lands, with a leſs ſervile tenure, to ſuch of the barbarians as ſolicited the protection of Rome.

Such had been the unworthy allies of the Egyptians; and while the attention of the ſtate was engaged in more ſerious wars, their vexatious inroads might again haraſs the repoſe of the province. With a view of oppoſing to the Blemmyes a ſuitable adverſary, Diocletian perſuaded the Nobatae, or people of Nubia, to remove from their ancient habitations in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of Lybia, and reſigned to them an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive but unprofitable territory above Syene and the cataracts of the Nile, with the ſtipulation, that they ſhould ever reſpect and guard the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier of the empire.

See Lactant. c. 32. Licinius was probably born about the year 250.</note>. That officer, in the ſedition <note place="margin">A.

The gratitude of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridates contributed ſoon afterwards to his reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I icinius was in every ſtation the friend and companion of Galerius, and the merit of Galerius, long before he was raiſed to the dignity of Caeſar, had been known and eſteemed by Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian. In the third year of that emperor's reign, Tiridates was inveſted with the kingdom of Armenia. The juſtice of the meaſure was not leſs evident than its expediency. It was time to reſcue from the uſurpation of the Perſian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch an important territory, which, ſince the reign of Nero, had been always granted under the protection of the empire to a younger branch of the houſe of Arſaces <note n="54" place="bottom">See the ſixty-ſecond and ſixty-third books of Dion Caſſius.</note>.</p>

When Tiridates appeared on the frontiers of Armenia, he was received with an unfeigned tranſport of joy and loyalty. During twenty-ſix <note place="margin">A.

The Perſian monarchs adorned their new conqueſt with magnificent buildings; but thoſe monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been erected at the expence of the people, and were abhorred as badges of ſlavery. The apprehenſion of a revolt had inſpired the moſt rigorous precautions: oppreſſion had been <note place="margin">State of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> aggravated by inſult, and the conſciouſneſs of the public hatred had been productive of every meaſure that could render it ſtill more impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. We have already remarked the intolerant ſpirit of the Magian religion. The ſtatues of the deified kings of Armenia, and the ſacred images of the ſun and moon, were broke in pieces by the zeal of the conqueror; and the perpetual fire of Ormuzd was kindled and preſerved upon an altar erected on the ſummit of mount Bagavan <note n="55" place="bottom">Moſes of Chorene, Hiſt.

It was natural, that a people exaſperated by ſo many injuries, ſhould arm with zeal in the cauſe <note place="margin">Revolt of the people and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> of their independence, their religion, and their hereditary ſovereign. The torrent bore down every obſtacle, and the Perſian garriſons retreated before its fury. The nobles of Armenia flew to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0034700102:156"/>
the ſtandard of Tiridates, all alleging their paſt merit, offering their future ſervice, and ſoliciting from the new king thoſe honours and rewards from which they had been excluded with diſdain under the foreign government <note n="56" place="bottom">The Armenian nobility was numerous and powerful. Moſes mentions many families which were diſtinguiſhed under the reign of Valarſaces (l. ii. 7.), and which ſtill ſubſiſted in his own time, about the middle of the fifth century. See the preface of his Editors.</note>. The command of the army was beſtowed on Artavaſdes, whoſe father had ſaved the infancy of Tiridates, and whoſe family had been maſſacred for that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous action. The brother of Artavaſdes obtained the government of a province. One of the firſt military dignities was conferred on the fatrap Otas, a man of ſingular temperance and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who preſented to the king, his ſiſter <note n="57" place="bottom">She was named Choſroiduchta, and had not the <hi>os patulum</hi> like other women.

In thoſe ages the Chineſe kept a garriſon at Kaſhgar, and one of their generals, about the time of Trajan, marched as far as the Caſpian ſea. With regard to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between China and the weſtern countries, a curious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir of M. de Guignes may be conſulted, in the Academie des In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, tom. xxxii. p. 355.</note>. Having incurred the diſpleaſure of his maſter, Mamgo, with his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, retired to the banks of the Oxus, and implored the protection of Sapor. The emperor of China claimed the fugitive, and alleged the rights of ſovereignty. The Perſian monarch pleaded the laws of hoſpitality, and with ſome difficulty avoided a war, by the promiſe that he would baniſh Mamgo to the uttermoſt parts of the Weſt; a puniſhment, as he deſcribed it, not leſs dreadful than death itſelf. Armenia was choſen for the place of exile, and a large diſtrict was aſſigned to the Scythian horde, on which they might feed their flocks and herds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their encampment from one place to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, according to the different ſeaſons of the year. They were employed to repel the invaſion of Tiridates; but their leader, after weighing the obligations and injuries which he had received from the Perſian monarch, reſolved to abandon his party. The Armenian prince, who was well acquainted with the merit as well as power of Mamgo, treated him with diſtinguiſhed reſpect; and by admitting him into his confidence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

He not only expelled the enemies of his family and country from the whole extent of Armenia, but in the proſecution of his revenge he carried his arms, or at leaſt his incurſions, into the heart of Aſſyria. The hiſtorian, who has preſerved the name of Tiridates from oblivion, celebrates, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of national enthuſiaſm, his perſonal proweſs; and, in the true ſpirit of eaſtern romance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the giants and the elephants that fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his invincible arm. It is from other infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that we diſcover the diſtracted ſtate of the Perſian monarchy, to which the king of Armenia was indebted for ſome part of his advantages. The throne was diſputed by the ambition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending brothers; and Hormuz, after exerting without ſucceſs the ſtrength of his own party, had recourſe to the dangerous aſſiſtance of the barbarians who inhabited the banks of the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Sea <note n="61" place="bottom">Ipſos Perſas ipſumque Regem aſcitis Saccis, et Ruſſis, et Gellis, petit frater Ormies.

            <p>Neither prudence nor honour could permit the <note place="margin">War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Perſians and the Romans.</note> emperors to forſake the cauſe of the Armenian king, and it was reſolved to exert the force of the empire in the Perſian war. Diocletian, with <note place="margin">A. D. 296.</note> the calm dignity which he conſtantly aſſumed, fixed his own ſtation in the city of Antioch, from whence he prepared and directed the military operations <note n="63" place="bottom">We may readily believe, that Lactantius aſcribes to cowardice the conduct of Diocletian. Julian, in his oration, ſays, that he remained with all the forces of the empire; a very hyperbolical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</note>. The conduct of the legions was intruſted to the intrepid valour of Galerius, who, for that important purpoſe, was removed from the banks of the Danube to thoſe of the Euphrates. The armies ſoon encountered each other in the <note place="margin">Defeat of Galerius.</note> plains of Meſopotamia, and two battles were fought with various and doubtful ſucceſs: but the third engagement was of a more deciſive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0034700102:160"/>
and the Roman army received a total over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, which is attributed to the raſhneſs of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius, who, with an inconſiderable body of troops, attacked the innumerable hoſt of the Perſians <note n="64" place="bottom">Our five abbreviators, Eutropius, Feſtus, the two Victors, and Oroſius, all relate the laſt and great battle; but Oroſius is the only one who ſpeaks of the two former.</note>. But the conſideration of the country that was the ſcene of action, may ſuggeſt another reaſon for his defeat. The ſame ground on which Galerius was vanquiſhed, had been rendered me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable by the death of Craſſus, and the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ten legions. It was a plain of more than ſixty miles, which extended from the hills of Carrhae to the Euphrates; a ſmooth and barren ſurface of ſandy deſert, without a hillock, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a tree, and without a ſpring of freſh water <note n="65" place="bottom">The nature of the country is finely deſcribed by Plutarch, in the life of Craſſus, and by Xenophon, in the firſt book of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſis.</note>. The ſteady infantry of the Romans, fainting with heat and thirſt, could neither hope for victory if they preſerved their ranks, nor break their ranks without expoſing themſelves to the moſt immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger. In this ſituation they were gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally encompaſſed by the ſuperior numbers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed by the rapid evolutions, and deſtroyed by the arrows of the barbarian cavalry. The king of Armenia had ſignalized his valour in the battle, and acquired perſonal glory by the public miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. He was purſued as far as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates; his horſe was wounded, and it appeared impoſſible for him to eſcape the victorious enemy.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0034700102:161"/>
In this extremity Tiridates embraced the only refuge which he ſaw before him: he diſmounted and plunged into the ſtream. His armour was heavy, the river very deep, and at thoſe parts at leaſt half a mile in breadth <note n="66" place="bottom">See Foſter's Diſſertation in the ſecond volume of the tranſlation of the Anabaſis by Spelman; which I will venture to recommend as one of the beſt verſions extant.</note>; yet ſuch was his ſtrength and dexterity, that he reached in ſafety the oppoſite bank <note n="67" place="bottom">Hiſt. Armen. l. ii. c. 76. I have transferred this exploit of Tiridates from an imaginary defeat to the real one of Galerius.</note>. With regard to the Roman general, we are ignorant of the circumſtances of his eſcape; but when he returned to Antioch, Diocletian received him, not with the tenderneſs <note place="margin">His recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</note> of a friend and colleague, but with the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an offended ſovereign. The haughtieſt of men, clothed in his purple, but humbled by the ſenſe of his fault and misfortune, was obliged to follow the emperor's chariot above a mile on foot, and to exhibit, before the whole court, the ſpectacle of his diſgrace <note n="68" place="bottom">Ammian.

            <p>As ſoon as Diocletian had indulged his private <note place="margin">Second campaign of Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> reſentment, and aſſerted the majeſty of ſupreme power, he yielded to the ſubmiſſive entreaties of the Caeſar, and permitted him to retrieve his own <note place="margin">A.

In the room of the unwarlike troops of Aſia, which had moſt probably ſerved in the firſt expedition, a ſecond army was drawn from the veterans and new levies of the Illyrian frontier, and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

body of Gothic auxiliaries were taken into the Imperial pay <note n="69" place="bottom">Aurelius Victor. Jornandes de Rebus Geticis, c. 21.</note>. At the head of a choſen army of twenty-five thouſand men, Galerius again paſſed the Euphrates; but, inſtead of expoſing his legions in the open plains of Meſopotamia, he advanced through the mountains of Armenia, where he found the inhabitants devoted to his cauſe, and the country as favourable to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of infantry, as it was inconvenient for the motions of cavalry <note n="70" place="bottom">Aurelius Victor ſays, "Per Armeniam in hoſtes contendit, que ferme ſola, ſeu facilior vincendi via eſt."

A ſurprize, eſpecially in the night-time, was for the moſt part fatal to a Perſian army. <q>Their horſes were tied, and generally ſhackled, to prevent their running away; and if an alarm happened, a Perſian had his houſing to fix, his horſe to bridle, and his corſlet to put on, before he could mount <note n="71" place="bottom">Xenophon's Anabaſis, l. iii. For that reaſon the Perſian ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry encamped ſixty ſtadia from the enemy.</note>.</q> On this occaſion, the impetuous attack of Galerius ſpread diſorder and diſmay over the camp of the barbarians. A ſlight reſiſtance was followed by a dreadful car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0034700102:163"/>
and, in the general confuſion, the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed monarch (for Narſes commanded his armies in perſon) fled towards the deſerts of Media. His ſumptuous tents, and thoſe of his ſatraps, afforded an immenſe booty to the conqueror; and an incident is mentioned, which proves the ruſtic but martia ignorance of the legions in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſuperfluities of life. A bag of ſhining lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther filled with pearls, fell into the hands of a private ſoldier; he carefully preſerved the bag, but he threw away its contents, judging, that whatever was of no uſe could not poſſibly be of any value <note n="72" place="bottom">The ſtory is told by Ammianus, l. xxii. Inſtead of <hi>ſaccum</hi> ſome read <hi>ſcutum.</hi>
               </note>. The principal loſs of Narſes was <note place="margin">and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his royal captives.</note> of a much more affecting nature. Several of his wives, his ſiſters, and children, who had attended the army, were made captives in the defeat. But though the character of Galerius had in general very little affinity with that of Alexander, he imitated, after his victory, the amiable behaviour of the Macedonian towards the family of Darius. The wives and children of Narſes were protected from violence and rapine, conveyed to a place of ſafety, and treated with every mark of reſpect and tenderneſs, that was due from a generous enemy, to their age, their ſex, and their royal dignity <note n="73" place="bottom">The Perſians confeſſed the Roman ſuperiority in morals as well as in arms.

The interview of the Roman princes at Niſibis was accompanied with every expreſſion of reſpect on one ſide, and of eſteem on the other.

The power, or at leaſt the ſpirit of Narſes, had been broken by his laſt defeat; and he conſidered an immediate peace as the only means that could ſtop the progreſs of the Roman arms.

the princes of his race. Notwithſtanding the juſtice of the Perſian cauſe, he was empowered to ſubmit the preſent differences to the deciſion of the emperors themſelves; convinced as he was, that, in the midſt of proſperity, they would not be unmindful of the viciſſitudes of fortune. Apharban concluded his diſcourſe in the ſtyle of eaſtern allegory, by obſerving that the Roman and Perſian monarchies were the two eyes of the world, which would remain imperfect and muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated if either of them ſhould be put out.</p>

               <q>It well becomes the Perſians, replied Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius, <note place="margin">Anſwer of Galerius.</note> with a tranſport of fury, which ſeemed to convulſe his whole frame, it well becomes the Perſians to expatiate on the viciſſitudes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and calmly to read us lectures on the virtues of moderation. Let them remember their own <hi>moderation</hi> towards the unhappy Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian. They vanquiſhed him by fraud, they treated him with indignity. They detained him till the laſt moment of his life in ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful captivity, and after his death they expoſed his body to perpetual ignominy.</q> Softening, however, his tone, Galerius inſinuated to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, that it had never been the practice of the Romans to trample on a proſtrate enemy; and that, on this occaſion, they ſhould conſult their own dignity, rather than the Perſian merit. He diſmiſſed Apharban with a hope, that Narſes would ſoon be informed on what conditions he might obtain, from the clemency of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, a laſting peace, and the reſtoration of his

wives and children. In this conference we may diſcover the fierce paſſions of Galerius, as well as his deference to the ſuperior wiſdom and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Diocletian. The ambition of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer graſped at the conqueſt of the Eaſt, and had propoſed to reduce Perſia into the ſtate of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. The prudence of the latter, who adhered <note place="margin">Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocletian.</note> to the moderate policy of Auguſtus and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonines, embraced the favourable opportunity of terminating a ſucceſsful war by an honourable and advantageous peace <note n="75" place="bottom">Adeo Victor (ſays Aurelius) ut ni Valerius, cujus nutu omnia gerebantur, abnuiſſet, Romani faſces in provinciam novam ferrentur.

            <p>In purſuance of their promiſe, the emperors ſoon afterwards appointed Sicorius Probus, one <note place="margin">Concluſion</note> of their ſecretaries, to acquaint the Perſian court with their final reſolution. As the miniſter of peace, he was received with every mark of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs and friendſhip; but, under the pretence of allowing him the neceſſary repoſe after ſo long a journey, the audience of Probus was deferred from day to day; and he attended the ſlow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the king, till at length he was admitted to his preſence, near the river Aſprudus in Media. The ſecret motive of Narſes in this delay, had been to collect ſuch a military force, as might enable him, though ſincerely deſirous of peace, to negociate with the greater weight and dignity. Three perſons only aſſiſted at this important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the miniſter Apharban, the praefect of the guards, and an officer who had commanded

This province ſeems to be mentioned by Moſes of Chorene (Geograph. p. 360.), and lay to the Eaſt of Mount Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note>. The firſt condition propoſed by the ambaſſador, is not at preſent of a very intelligible nature; that the city of Niſibis might be eſtabliſhed for the place of mutual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or, as we ſhould formerly have termed it, for the ſtaple of trade, between the two em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. There is no difficulty in conceiving the intention of the Roman princes to improve their revenue by ſome reſtraints upon commerce; but as Niſibis was ſituated within their own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and as they were maſters both of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and exports, it ſhould ſeem, that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints were the objects of an internal law, rather than of a foreign treaty. To render them more effectual, ſome ſtipulations were probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on the ſide of the king of Perſia, which appeared ſo very repugnant either to his intereſt or to his dignity, that Narſes could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to ſubſcribe them. As this was the only article to which he refuſed his conſent, it was no longer inſiſted on; and the emperors either ſuffered the trade to flow in its natural channels, or contented themſelves with ſuch reſtrictions, as it depended on their own authority to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as this difficulty was removed, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn peace was concluded and ratified between <note place="margin">and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the treaty.</note> the two nations. The conditions of a treaty ſo glorious to the empire, and ſo neceſſary to Perſia,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0034700102:168"/>
may deſerve a more peculiar attention, as the hiſtory of Rome preſents very few tranſactions of a ſimilar nature; moſt of her wars having either been terminated by abſolute conqueſt, or waged againſt barbarians ignorant of the uſe of letters. I. The Aboras, or, as it is called by Xenophon, <note place="margin">The Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras fixed as the limits between the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.</note> the Araxes, was fixed as the boundary between the two monarchies <note n="77" place="bottom">By an error of the geographer Ptolemy, the poſition of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara is removed from the Aboras to the Tigris, which may have produced the miſtake of Peter, in aſſigning the latter river for the boundary, inſtead of the former. The line of the Roman frontier traverſed, but never followed, the courſe of the Tigris.</note>. That river, which roſe near the Tigris, was increaſed a few miles below Niſibis, by the little ſtream of the Mygdonius, paſſed under the walls of Singara, and fell into the Euphrates at Circeſium, a frontier town, which, by the care of Diocletian, was very ſtrongly fortified <note n="78" place="bottom">Procopius de Edificiis, l. ii. c. 6.</note>. Meſopotamia, the object of ſo many wars, was ceded to the empire; and the Perſians, by this treaty, renounced all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to that great province. II. They relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed <note place="margin">Ceſſion of five pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Tigris.</note> to the Romans five provinces beyond the Tigris <note n="79" place="bottom">Three of the provinces, Zabdicene, Arzanene, and Carduene, are allowed on all ſides. But inſtead of the other two, Peter (in Excerpt. Leg. p. 30.) inſerts Rehimene and Sophene. I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Ammianus (l. xxv. 7.), becauſe it might be proved, that Sophene was never in the hands of the Perſians, either before the reign of Diocletian, or after that of Jovian. For want of correct maps, like thoſe of M. d'Anville, almoſt all the moderns, with Tillemont and Valeſius at their head, have imagined, that it was in reſpect to Perſia, and not to Rome, that the five provinces were ſituate beyond the Tigris.</note>. Their ſituation formed a very uſeful barrier, and their natural ſtrength was ſoon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0034700102:169"/>
by art and military ſkill. Four of theſe, to the north of the river, were diſtricts of obſcure fame and inconſiderable extent; Intiline, Zab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicene, Arzanene, and Moxoene: but on the eaſt of the Tigris, the empire acquired the large and mountainous territory of Carduene, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſeat of the Carduchians, who preſerved for many ages their manly freedom in the heart of the deſpotic monarchies of Aſia. The ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Greeks traverſed their country, after a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful march, or rather engagement, of ſeven days; and it is confeſſed by their leader, in his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable relation of the retreat, that they ſuffered more from the arrows of the Carduchians, than from the power of the Great King <note n="80" place="bottom">Xenophon's Anabaſis, l. iv.

It <note place="margin">Armenia.</note> is almoſt needleſs to obſerve, that Tiridates, the faithful ally of Rome, was reſtored to the throne of his fathers, and that the rights of the Imperial ſupremacy were fully aſſerted and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. The limits of Armenia were extended as far as the fortreſs of Sintha in Media, and this increaſe of dominion was not ſo much an act of liberality as of juſtice.

As ſoon as Diocletian entered into the <note place="margin">A. D. 303.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0034700102:172"/>
ſingular nature, a Perſian victory followed by an important conqueſt. The repreſentations of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, mountains, and provinces, were carried before the Imperial car. The images of the captive wives, the ſiſters, and the children of the Great King, afforded a new and grateful ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle to the vanity of the people <note n="87" place="bottom">Eutropius (ix. 27.) mentions them as a part of the triumph.

In the eyes of poſterity this triumph is remarkable, by a diſtinction of a leſs honourable kind. It was the laſt that Rome ever beheld. Soon after this period, the emperors ceaſed to vanquiſh, and Rome ceaſed to be the capital of the empire.</p>
            <p>The ſpot on which Rome was founded, <note place="margin">Long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors from Rome.</note> had been conſecrated by ancient ceremonies and imaginary miracles.

It was derived from their anceſtors, had grown up with their earlieſt habits of life, and was protected, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by the opinion of political utility.

According to the ingenious conjecture of Le Fevre and Dacier, the third ode of the third book of Horace was intended to divert Auguſtus from the execution of a ſimilar deſign.</note>. But the ſovereignty of the capital was gradually annihilated in the extent of conqueſt; the provinces roſe to the ſame level, and the vanquiſhed nations acquired the name and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, without imbibing the partial affections, of Romans. During a long period, however, the remains of the ancient conſtitution, and the influence of cuſtom, preſerved the dignity of Rome. The emperors, though perhaps of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can or Illyrian extraction, reſpected their adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed country, as the ſeat of their power, and the centre of their extenſive dominions. The emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of war very frequently required their preſence on the frontiers; but Diocletian and Maximian were the firſt Roman princes who fixed, in time of peace, their ordinary reſidence in the provinces; and their conduct, however it might be ſuggeſted by private motives, was juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by very ſpecious conſiderations of policy.

A circus, a theatre, a mint, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, baths, which bore the name of their founder Maximian; porticoes adorned with ſtatues, and a double circumference of walls, contributed to the beauty of the new capital; nor did it ſeem oppreſſed even by the proximity of Rome <note n="90" place="bottom">See Aurelius Victor, who likewiſe mentions the buildings erected by Maximian at Carthage, probably during the Mooriſh war.

Till Diocletian, in the twentieth year of his reign, celebrated his Roman triumph, it is extremely doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ever viſited the ancient capital of the empire. Even on that memorable occaſion his ſtay did not exceed two months.

That crafty prince had framed a new ſyſtem of Imperial government, which was afterwards completed by the family of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; and as the image of the old conſtitution was religiouſly preſerved in the ſenate, he reſolved to deprive that order of its ſmall remains of power and conſideration. We may recollect, about eight years before the elevation of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian, the tranſient greatneſs, and the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious hopes, of the Roman ſenate. As long as that enthuſiaſm prevailed, many of the nobles
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0034700102:176"/>
imprudently diſplayed their zeal in the cauſe of freedom; and after the ſucceſſors of Probus had withdrawn their countenance from the republican party, the ſenators were unable to diſguiſe their impotent reſentment. As the ſovereign of Italy, Maximian was intruſted with the care of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing this troubleſome, rather than danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſpirit, and the taſk was perfectly ſuited to his cruel temper. The moſt illuſtrious mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſenate, whom Diocletian always affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eſteem, were involved, by his colleague, in the accuſation of imaginary plots; and the poſſeſſion of an elegant villa, or a well cultivated eſtate, was interpreted as a convincing evidence of guilt <note n="93" place="bottom">Lactantius accuſes Maximian of deſtroying fictis criminatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus lumina ſenatûs (De M.

But the moſt fatal though ſecret wound, which the ſenate received from the hands of Diocletian and Maximian, was inflicted by the inevitable operation of their abſence. As long as the emperors reſided at Rome, that aſſembly might be oppreſſed, but it could ſcarcely be neglected. The ſucceſſors of Auguſtus exerciſed the power of dictating whatever laws their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or caprice might ſuggeſt; but thoſe laws were ratified by the ſanction of the ſenate. The model of ancient freedom was preſerved in its deliberations and decrees; and wiſe princes, who reſpected the prejudices of the Roman people, were in ſome meaſure obliged to aſſume the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and behaviour ſuitable to the general and firſt magiſtrate of the republic. In the armies and in the provinces, they diſplayed the dignity of monarchs; and when they fixed their reſidence at a diſtance from the capital, they for ever laid aſide the diſſimulation which Auguſtus had recommended to his ſucceſſors. In the exerciſe of the legiſlative as well as the executive power, the ſovereign adviſed with his miniſters, inſtead of conſulting the great council of the nation. The name of the ſenate was mentioned with honour till the laſt period of the empire; the

vanity of its members was ſtill flattered with honorary diſtinctions <note n="96" place="bottom">See the Theodoſian Code, l. vi. tit. ii. with Godefroy's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.</note>; but the aſſembly which had ſo long been the ſource, and ſo long the inſtrument of power, was reſpectfully ſuffered to ſink into oblivion. The ſenate of Rome, loſing all connection with the Imperial court and the actual conſtitution, was left a venerable but uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs monument of antiquity on the Capitoline hill.</p>
            <p>When the Roman princes had loſt ſight of the ſenate and of their ancient capital, they eaſily <note place="margin">Civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracies laid aſide.</note> forgot the origin and nature of their legal power. The civil offices of conſul, of proconſul, of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and of tribune, by the union of which it had been formed, betrayed to the people its republican extraction. Thoſe modeſt titles were laid aſide <note n="97" place="bottom">See the 12th diſſertation in Spanheim's excellent work de Uſu Numiſmatum.

The name of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, which was at firſt of a military nature, <note place="margin">Imperial dignity and titles.</note> was aſſociated with another of a more ſervile kind. The epithet of DOMINUS, or Lord, in its primitive ſignification, was expreſſive, not of the authority of a prince over his ſubjects, or
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0034700102:179"/>
of a commander over his ſoldiers, but of the deſpotic power of a maſter over his domeſtic ſlaves <note n="98" place="bottom">Pliny (in Panegyr. c. 3. 55, &amp;c.) ſpeaks of <hi>Dominus</hi> with exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, as ſynonymous to Tyrant, and oppoſite to Prince. And the ſame Pliny regularly gives that title (in the tenth book of the epiſtles) to his friend rather than maſter, the virtuous Trajan. This ſtrange contradiction puzzles the commentators, who think, and the tranſlators, who can write.</note>. Viewing it in that odious light, it had been rejected with abhorrence by the firſt Caeſars. Their reſiſtance inſenſibly became more feeble, and the name leſs odious; till at length the ſtyle of <hi>our Lord and Emperor,</hi> was not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by flattery, but was regularly admitted into the laws and public monuments. Such lofty epithets were ſufficient to elate and ſatisfy the moſt exceſſive vanity; and if the ſucceſſors of Diocletian ſtill declined the title of King, it ſeems to have been the effect not ſo much of their moderation as of their delicacy. Wherever the Latin tongue was in uſe (and it was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of government throughout the empire), the Imperial title, as it was peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, conveyed a more reſpectable idea than the name of King, which they muſt have ſhared with an hundred barbarian chieftains; or which, at the beſt, they could derive only from Romulus or from Tarquin. But the ſentiments of the Eaſt were very different from thoſe of the Weſt. From the earlieſt period of hiſtory, the ſovereigns of Aſia had been celebrated in the Greek lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage by the title of BASILEUS, or King; and ſince it was conſidered as the firſt diſtinction
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0034700102:180"/>
among men, it was ſoon employed by the ſervile provincials of the Eaſt, in their humble addreſſes to the Roman throne <note n="99" place="bottom">Syneſius de Regno, Edit. Petav. p. 15. I am indebted for this quotation to the Abbé de la Bleterie.</note>.

Their principal diſtinction was the Imperial or military robe of purple; whilſt the ſenatorial garment was marked by a broad, and the equeſtrian by a narrow, band or ſtripe of the ſame honourable colour. The pride, or rather the policy, of Diocletian, engaged that artful prince to introduce the ſtately magnificence of the court of Perſia <note n="101" place="bottom">See Spanheim de Uſu Numiſmat. Diſſertat. xii.</note>. He ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to aſſume the diadem, an ornament deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Romans as the odious enſign of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and the uſe of which had been conſidered
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0034700102:181"/>
as the moſt deſperate act of the madneſs of Caligula. It was no more than a broad white fillet ſet with pearls, which encircled the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's head. The ſumptuous robes of Diocletian and his ſucceſſors were of ſilk and gold; and it is remarked with indignation, that even their ſhoes were ſtudded with the moſt precious gems. The acceſs to their ſacred perſon was every day rendered more difficult, by the inſtitution of new forms and ceremonies. The avenues of the palace were ſtrictly guarded by the various <hi>ſchools,</hi> as they began to be called, of domeſtic officers. The interior apartments were intruſted to the jealous vigilance of the eunuchs; the increaſe of whoſe numbers and influence was the moſt infallible ſymptom of the progreſs of deſpotiſm. When a ſubject was at length admitted to the Imperial preſence, he was obliged, whatever might be his rank, to fall proſtrate on the ground, and to adore, according to the eaſtern faſhion, the divinity of his lord and maſter <note n="102" place="bottom">Aurelius Victor.

Diocletian was a man of ſenſe, who, in the courſe of private as well as public life, had formed a juſt eſtimate both of himſelf and of mankind: nor is it eaſy to conceive, that in ſubſtituting the manners of Perſia to thoſe of Rome, he was ſeriouſly actuated by ſo mean a principle as that of vanity. He flattered himſelf, that an oſtentation of ſplendour and luxury would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the imagination of the multitude; that the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0034700102:182"/>
monarch would be leſs expoſed to the rude licence of the people and the ſoldiers, as his perſon was ſecluded from the public view; and that habits of ſubmiſſion would inſenſibly be productive of ſentiments of veneration. Like the modeſty affected by Auguſtus, the ſtate maintained by Diocletian was a theatrical repreſentation; but it muſt be confeſſed, that of the two comedies, the former was of a much more liberal and manly character than the latter. It was the aim of the one to diſguiſe, and the object of the other to diſplay, the unbounded power which the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors poſſeſſed over the Roman world.</p>
            <p>Oſtentation was the firſt principle of the new <note place="margin">New form of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſti, and two Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars.</note> ſyſtem inſtituted by Diocletian. The ſecond was diviſion. He divided the empire, the provinces, and every branch of the civil as well as military adminiſtration. He multiplied the wheels of the machine of government, and rendered its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations leſs rapid but more ſecure. Whatever advantages, and whatever defects might attend theſe innovations, they muſt be aſcribed in a very great degree to the firſt inventor; but as the new frame of policy was gradually improved and completed by ſucceeding princes, it will be more ſatisfactory to delay the conſideration of it till the ſeaſon of its full maturity and perfection <note n="103" place="bottom">The innovations introduced by Diocletian, are chiefly deduced, 1ſt, from ſome very ſtrong paſſages in Lactantius; and, 2dly, from the new and various offices, which, in the Theodoſian code, appear <hi>already</hi> eſtabliſhed in the beginning of the reign of Conſtantine.</note>. Reſerving, therefore, for the reign of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0034700102:183"/>
a more exact picture of the new empire, we ſhall content ourſelves with deſcribing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and deciſive outline, as it was traced by the hand of Diocletian. He had aſſociated three colleagues in the exerciſe of the ſupreme power; and as he was convinced that the abilities of a ſingle man were inadequate to the public defence, he conſidered the joint adminiſtration of four princes not as a temporary expedient, but as a fundamental law of the conſtitution. It was his intention, that the two elder princes ſhould be diſtinguiſhed by the uſe of the diadem, and the title of <hi>Auguſti:</hi> that, as affection or eſteem might direct their choice, they ſhould regularly call to their aſſiſtance two ſubordinate colleagues; and that the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> riſing in their turn to the firſt rank, ſhould ſupply an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of emperors. The empire was divided into four parts. The Eaſt and Italy were the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, the Danube and the Rhine the moſt laborious ſtations. The former claimed the preſence of the <hi>Auguſti,</hi> the latter were intruſted to the adminiſtration of the <hi>Caeſars.</hi> The ſtrength of the legions was in the hands of the four part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of ſovereignty, and the deſpair of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively vanquiſhing four formidable rivals, might intimidate the ambition of an aſpiring general. In their civil government, the emperors were ſuppoſed to exerciſe the undivided power of the monarch, and their edicts, inſcribed with their joint names, were received in all the provinces, as promulgated by their mutual councils and authority. Notwithſtanding theſe precautions,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0034700102:184"/>
the political union of the Roman world was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually diſſolved, and a principle of diviſion was introduced, which, in the courſe of a few years, occaſioned the perpetual ſeparation of the eaſtern and weſtern empires.</p>
            <p>The ſyſtem of Diocletian was accompanied <note place="margin">Increaſe of taxes.</note> with another very material diſadvantage, which cannot even at preſent be totally overlooked; a more expenſive eſtabliſhment, and conſequently an increaſe of taxes, and the oppreſſion of the people. Inſtead of a modeſt family of ſlaves and freedmen, ſuch as had contented the ſimple greatneſs of Auguſtus and Trajan, three or four magnificent courts were eſtabliſhed in the various parts of the empire, and as many Roman <hi>kings</hi> contended with each other and with the Perſian monarch for the vain ſuperiority of pomp and luxury. The number of miniſters, of magiſtrates, of officers, and of ſervants, who filled the different departments of the ſtate, was multiplied beyond the example of former times; and (if we may borrow the warm expreſſion of a contemporary), <q>when the proportion of thoſe who received, exceeded the proportion of thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, the provinces were oppreſſed by the weight of tributes <note n="104" place="bottom">Lactant. de M. P. c. 7.</note>.</q> From this period to the extinction of the empire, it would be eaſy to deduce an uninterrupted ſeries of clamours and complaints. According to his religion and ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, each writer chuſes either Diocletian, or Conſtantine, or Valens, or Theodoſius, for the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0034700102:185"/>
object of his invectives; but they unanimouſly agree in repreſenting the burden of the public impoſitions, and particularly the land-tax and capitation, as the intolerable and increaſing grievance of their own times. From ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, an impartial hiſtorian, who is obliged to extract truth from ſatire, as well as from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric, will be inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they accuſe, and to aſcribe their exactions much leſs to their perſonal vices, than to the uniform ſyſtem of their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. The emperor Diocletian was indeed the author of that ſyſtem; but during his reign, the growing evil was confined within the bounds of modeſty and diſcretion, and he deſerves the reproach of eſtabliſhing pernicious precedents, rather than of exerciſing actual oppreſſion <note n="105" place="bottom">Indicta lex nova quae ſane illorum temporum modeſtiâ tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilis, in perniciem proceſſit. Aurel. Victor, who has treated the character of Diocletian with good ſenſe, though in bad Latin.</note>. It may be added, that his revenues were manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with prudent oeconomy; and that after all the current expences were diſcharged, there ſtill remained in the Imperial treaſury an ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion either for judicious liberality or for any emergency of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>It was in the twenty-firſt year of his reign that Diocletian executed his memorable reſolution of <note place="margin">Abdicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian and Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> abdicating the empire; an action more naturally to have been expected from the elder or the younger Antoninus, than from a prince who had never practiſed the leſſons of philoſophy either in the attainment or in the uſe of ſupreme power.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0034700102:186"/>
Diocletian acquired the glory of giving to the world the firſt example of a reſignation <note n="106" place="bottom">Solus omnium, poſt conditum Romanum Imperium, qui ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tanto faſtigio ſponte ad privatae vitae ſtatum civilitatemque remearet. Eutrop. ix. 28.</note>, which has not been very frequently imitated by ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monarchs. The parallel of Charles the Fifth, <note place="margin">Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to Charles the Fifth.</note> however, will naturally offer itſelf to our mind, not only ſince the eloquence of a modern hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian has rendered that name ſo familiar to an Engliſh reader, but from the very ſtriking reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between the characters of the two empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, whoſe political abilities were ſuperior to their military genius, and whoſe ſpecious virtues were much leſs the effect of nature than of art. The abdication of Charles appears to have been haſtened by the viciſſitude of fortune; and the diſappointment of his favourite ſchemes urged him to relinquiſh a power which he found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to his ambition. But the reign of Diocletian had flowed with a tide of uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſs; nor was it till after he had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed all his enemies, and accompliſhed all his deſigns, that he ſeems to have entertained any ſerious thoughts of reſigning the empire. Neither Charles nor Diocletian were arrived at a very advanced period of life; ſince the one was only fifty-five, and the other was no more than fifty-nine years of age; but the active life of thoſe princes, their wars and journies, the cares of royalty, and their application to buſineſs, had
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0034700102:187"/>
already impaired their conſtitution, and brought on the infirmities of a premature old age <note n="107" place="bottom">The particulars of the journey and illneſs are taken from Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius (c. 17.), who may <hi>ſometimes</hi> be admitted as an evidence of public facts, though very ſeldom of private anecdotes.</note>.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the ſeverity of a very cold and rainy winter, Diocletian left Italy ſoon after <note place="margin">A. D. 304. Long ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</note> the ceremony of his triumph, and began his progreſs towards the Eaſt round the circuit of the Illyrian provinces. From the inclemency of the weather, and the fatigue of the journey, he ſoon contracted a ſlow illneſs; and though he made eaſy marches, and was generally carried in a cloſe litter, his diſorder, before he arrived at Nicomedia, about the end of the ſummer, was become very ſerious and alarming. During the whole winter he was confined to his palace; his danger inſpired a general and unaffected concern; but the people could only judge of the various alterations of his health, from the joy or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation which they diſcovered in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances and behaviour of his attendants. The rumour of his death was for ſome time univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally believed, and it was ſuppoſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, with a view to prevent the troubles that might have happened during the abſence of the Caeſar Galerius. At length, however, on the firſt of March, Diocletian once more appeared in public, but ſo pale and emaciated, that he could ſcarcely have been recogniſed by thoſe to whom his perſon was the moſt familiar. It was time to put an end to the painful ſtruggle, which he had <note place="margin">His pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0034700102:188"/>
ſuſtained during more than a year, between the care of his health and that of his dignity. The former required indulgence and relaxation, the latter compelled him to direct, from the bed of ſickneſs, the adminiſtration of a great empire. He reſolved to paſs the remainder of his days in honourable repoſe, to place his glory beyond the reach of fortune, and to relinquiſh the theatre of the world to his younger and more active aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates <note n="108" place="bottom">Aurelius Victor aſcribes the abdication, which had been ſo variouſly accounted for, to two cauſes. 1ſt, Diocletian's contempt of ambition; and 2dly, His apprehenſion of impending troubles. One of the panegyriſts (vi. 9.) mentions the age and infirmities of Diocletian, as a very natural reaſon for his retirement.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ceremony of his abdication was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſpacious plain, about three miles from Nicomedia. The emperor aſcended a lofty throne, and in a ſpeech, full of reaſon and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, declared his intention, both to the people and to the ſoldiers who were aſſembled on this extraordinary occaſion. As ſoon as he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted <note place="margin">A. D. 305.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0034700102:189"/>
Even in the ſplendour of the Roman triumph, Diocletian had meditated his deſign of abdicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the government. As he wiſhed to ſecure the obedience of Maximian, he exacted from him, either a general aſſurance that he would ſubmit his actions to the authority of his benefactor, or a particular promiſe that he would deſcend from the throne, whenever he ſhould receive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and the example. This engagement, though it was confirmed by the ſolemnity of an oath before the altar of the Capitoline Jupiter <note n="110" place="bottom">See Panegyr. Veter. vi. 9. The oration was pronounced after Maximian had reaſſumed the purple.</note>, would have proved a feeble reſtraint on the fierce temper of Maximian, whoſe paſſion was the love of power, and who neither deſired preſent tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity nor future reputation. But he yielded, however reluctantly, to the aſcendant which his wiſer colleague had acquired over him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, immediately after his abdication, to a villa in Lucania, where it was almoſt impoſſible that ſuch an impatient ſpirit could find any laſting tranquillity.</p>
            <p>Diocletian, who, from a ſervile origin, had <note place="margin">Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diocletian at Salona.</note> raiſed himſelf to the throne, paſſed the nine laſt years of his life in a private condition. Reaſon had dictated, and content ſeems to have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied, his retreat, in which he enjoyed for a long time the reſpect of thoſe princes to whom he had reſigned the poſſeſſion of the world <note n="111" place="bottom">Eumenius pays him a very fine compliment: <q>At enim divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num illum virum, qui primus imperium et participavit et poſuit, conſilii et facti ſui non poenitet; nec amiſiſſe ſe putat quod ſponte tranſcripſit.

It is ſeldom that minds, long exerciſed in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, have formed any habits of converſing with themſelves, and in the loſs of power they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally regret the want of occupation. The amuſements of letters and of devotion, which afford ſo many reſources in ſolitude, were inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of fixing the attention of Diocletian; but he had preſerved, or at leaſt he ſoon recovered, a taſte for the moſt innocent as well as natural pleaſures, and his leiſure hours were ſufficiently employed in building, planting, and gardening. His anſwer to Maximian is deſervedly celebrated. He was ſolicited by that reſtleſs old man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume <note place="margin">His phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</note> the reins of government, and the Imperial purple.

Secluded from mankind by his exalted dignity, the truth is concealed from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; he can ſee only with their eyes, he hears nothing but their miſrepreſentations. He confers the moſt important offices upon vice and weakneſs, and diſgraces the moſt virtuous and deſerving among his ſubjects. By ſuch infamous arts, added Diocletian, the beſt and wiſeſt princes are ſold to the venal corruption of their courtiers <note n="113" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 223, 224.

It was impoſſible that he could remain ignorant of the troubles which afflicted the empire after his abdication. It was impoſſible that he could be indifferent to their conſequences. Fear, ſorrow, and diſcontent, ſometimes purſued him into the ſolitude of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona. His tenderneſs, or at leaſt his pride, was deeply wounded by the misfortunes of his wife and daughter; and the laſt moments of Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian were embittered by ſome affronts, which Licinius and Conſtantine might have ſpared the father of ſo many emperors, and the firſt author of their own fortune.

Salona, a principal city of his native province of Dalmatia, was near two hundred Roman miles (according to the meaſurement of the public highways) from Aquileia and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Italy, and about two hundred and ſeventy from Sirmium, the uſual reſidence of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors whenever they viſited the Illyrian frontier <note n="115" place="bottom">See the Itiner. p. 269. 272.

About ſix or ſeven miles from the city, Diocletian conſtructed a magnificent palace, and we may infer, from the greatneſs of the work, how long he had meditated his deſign of abdicating the empire. The choice of a ſpot which united all that could contribute either to health or to luxury, did not

On the north ſide lies the bay, which led to the ancient city of Salona; and the country beyond it, appearing in ſight, forms a proper contraſt to that more extenſive proſpect of water, which the Hadriatic preſents both to the ſouth and to the eaſt.

The form was quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, flanked with ſixteen towers. Two of the ſides were near ſix hundred, and the other two near ſeven hundred feet in length. The whole was conſtructed of a beautiful free-ſtone, extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the neighbouring quarries of Trau or Tragutium, and very little inferior to marble itſelf. Four ſtreets, interſecting each other at right angles, divided the ſeveral parts of this great edifice, and the approach to the principal apartment was from a very ſtately entrance, which is ſtill denominated the Golden Gate.

Their forms were various, their proportions juſt, but they were all attended with two imperfections, very repugnant to our modern notions of taſte and conveniency. Theſe ſtately rooms had neither windows nor chimnies. They were light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the top (for the building ſeems to have conſiſted of no more than one ſtory), and they received their heat by the help of pipes that were conveyed along the walls. The range of principal apartments was protected towards the ſouth-weſt, by a portico of five hundred and ſeventeen feet long, which muſt have formed a very noble and delightful walk, when the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of painting and ſculpture were added to thoſe of the proſpect.</p>
            <p>Had this magnificent edifice remained in a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary country, it would have been expoſed to the ravages of time; but it might, perhaps, have eſcaped the rapacious induſtry of man. The village of Aſpalathus <note n="120" place="bottom">D'Anville, Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p. 162.</note>, and long afterwards the provincial town of Spalatro, have grown out of its ruins.

            <p>It is almoſt unneceſſary to remark, that the <note place="margin">Of letters.</note> civil diſtractions of the empire, the licence of the ſoldiers, the inroads of the barbarians, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0034700102:197"/>
the progreſs of deſpotiſm, had proved very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable to genius, and even to learning. The ſucceſſion of Illyrian princes reſtored the empire, without reſtoring the ſciences. Their military education was not calculated to inſpire them with the love of letters; and even the mind of Diocletian, however active and capacious in buſineſs, was totally uninformed by ſtudy or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. The profeſſions of law and phyſic are of ſuch common uſe and certain profit, that they will always ſecure a ſufficient number of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, endowed with a reaſonable degree of abilities and knowledge; but it does not appear that the ſtudents in thoſe two faculties appeal to any celebrated maſters who have flouriſhed within that period. The voice of poetry was ſilent. Hiſtory was reduced to dry and confuſed abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, alike deſtitute of amuſement and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A languid and affected eloquence was ſtill retained in the pay and ſervice of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, who encouraged not any arts except thoſe which contributed to the gratification of their pride, or the defence of their power <note n="123" place="bottom">The orator Eumenius was ſecretary to the emperors Maximian and Conſtantius, and Profeſſor of Rhetoric in the college of Autun.

Conſuming their reaſon in theſe deep but unſubſtantial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, their minds were expoſed to illuſions of fancy. They flattered themſelves that they poſſeſſed the ſecret of diſengaging the ſoul from its corporeal priſon; claimed a familiar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with daemons and ſpirits; and, by a very ſingular revolution, converted the ſtudy of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy into that of magic. The ancient ſages
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0034700102:199"/>
had derided the popular ſuperſtition; after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing its extravagance by the thin pretence of allegory, the diſciples of Plotinus and Porphyry became its moſt zealous defenders. As they agreed with the Chriſtians in a few myſterious points of faith, they attacked the remainder of their theological ſyſtem with all the fury of civil war. The new Platoniſts would ſcarcely deſerve a place in the hiſtory of ſcience, but in that of the church the mention of them will very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occur.</p>

            <p>THE balance of power eſtabliſhed by Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian ſubſiſted no longer than while it was ſuſtained by the firm and dexterous hand of <note place="margin">Period of civil wars and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> the founder. It required ſuch a fortunate mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of different tempers and abilities, as could ſcarcely be found or even expected a ſecond time; <note place="margin">A. D. 305—323.</note> two emperors without jealouſy, two Caeſars with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ambition, and the ſame general intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably purſued by four independent princes. The abdication of Diocletian and Maximian was ſucceeded by eighteen years of diſcord and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. The empire was afflicted by five civil wars; and the remainder of the time was not ſo much a ſtate of tranquillity as a ſuſpenſion of arms between ſeveral hoſtile monarchs, who, viewing each other with an eye of fear and hatred, ſtrove to increaſe their reſpective forces at the expence of their ſubjects.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Diocletian and Maximian had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the purple, their ſtation, according to the <note place="margin">Character and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> rules of the new conſtitution, was filled by the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0034700102:201"/>
two Caeſars, Conſtantius and Galerius, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſſumed the title of Auguſtus <note n="1" place="bottom">M. de Monteſquieu (Conſiderations ſur la Grandeur et la Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence des Romains, c. 17.) ſuppoſes, on the authority of Oroſius and Euſebius, that, on this occaſion, the empire, for the firſt time, was <hi>really</hi> divided into two parts. It is difficult, however, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in what reſpect the plan of Galerius differed from that of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian.</note>. The honours of ſeniority and precedence were allowed to the former of thoſe princes, and he continued, under a new appellation, to adminiſter his ancient department of Gaul, Spain, and Britain. The government of thoſe ample provinces was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to exerciſe his talents, and to ſatisfy his ambition. Clemency, temperance, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, diſtinguiſhed the amiable character of Conſtantius, and his fortunate ſubjects had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occaſion to compare the virtues of their ſovereign with the paſſions of Maximian, and even with the arts of Diocletian <note n="2" place="bottom">Hic non modo amabilis, ſed etiam venerabilis Gallis ſuit; praecipue quòd Diocletiani ſuſpectam prudentiam, et Maximiani ſanguinariam violentiam imperio ejus evaſerant. Eutrop. Breviar. x. 1.</note>. Inſtead of imitating their eaſtern pride and magnificence, Conſtantius preſerved the modeſty of a Roman prince. He declared, with unaffected ſincerity, that his moſt valued treaſure was in the hearts of his people, and that, whenever the dignity of the throne, or the danger of the ſtate, required any extraordinary ſupply, he could depend with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence on their gratitude and liberality <note n="3" place="bottom">Divitiis Provincialium (mel. <hi>provinciarum)</hi> ac privatorum ſtudens, fiſci commoda non admodum affectans; ducenſque melius publicas opes a privatis haberi, quam intra unum clauſtrum reſervari. Id. ibid. He carried this maxim ſo far, that whenever he gave an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, he was obliged to borrow a ſervice of plate.</note>. The
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0034700102:202"/>
provincials of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, ſenſible of his worth and of their own happineſs, reflected with anxiety on the declining health of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Conſtantius, and the tender age of his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous family, the iſſue of his ſecond marriage with the daughter of Maximian.</p>
            <p>The ſtern temper of Galerius was caſt in a very different mould; and while he commanded <note place="margin">Of Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> the eſteem of his ſubjects, he ſeldom condeſcended to ſolicit their affections. His fame in arms, and above all, the ſucceſs of the Perſian war, had elated his haughty mind, which was naturally impatient of a ſuperior, or even of an equal. If it were poſſible to rely on the partial teſtimony of an injudicious writer, we might aſcribe the abdication of Diocletian to the menaces of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius, and relate the particulars of a <hi>private</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation between the two princes, in which the former diſcovered as much puſillanimity as the latter diſplayed ingratitude and arrogance <note n="4" place="bottom">Lactantius de Mort. Perſecutor. c. 18. Were the particulars of this conference more conſiſtent with truth and decency, we might ſtill aſk, how they came to the knowledge of an obſcure rhetorician? But there are many hiſtorians who put us in mind of the admirable ſaying of the great Condè to cardinal de Retz; <q>Ces coquins nous font parler et agir, comme ils auroient fait eux-memes à notre place.</q>
               </note>. But theſe obſcure anecdotes are ſufficiently refuted by an impartial view of the character and conduct of Diocletian. Whatever might otherwiſe have been his intentions, if he had apprehended any
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0034700102:203"/>
danger from the violence of Galerius, his good ſenſe would have inſtructed him to prevent the ignominious conteſt; and as he had held the ſceptre with glory, he would have reſigned it without diſgrace.</p>
            <p>After the elevation of Conſtantius and Galerius <note place="margin">The two Caeſars, Severus and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imin.</note> to the rank of <hi>Auguſti,</hi> two new <hi>Caeſars</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to ſupply their place, and to complete the ſyſtem of the Imperial government. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian was ſincerely deſirous of withdrawing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the world; he conſidered Galerius, who had married his daughter, as the firmeſt ſupport of his family and of the empire; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, without reluctance, that his ſucceſſor ſhould aſſume the merit as well as the envy of the important nomination. It was fixed without conſulting the intereſt or inclination of the princes of the Weſt. Each of them had a ſon who was arrived at the age of manhood, and who might have been deemed the moſt natural candidates for the vacant honour. But the impotent reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Maximian was no longer to be dreaded; and the moderate Conſtantius, though he might deſpiſe the dangers, was humanely apprehenſive of the calamities of civil war. The two perſons whom Galerius promoted to the rank of Caeſar, were much better ſuited to ſerve the views of his ambition; and their principal recommendation ſeems to have conſiſted in the want of merit or perſonal conſequence. The firſt of theſe was Daza, or, as he was afterwards called, Maximin, whoſe mother was the ſiſter of Galerius. The
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0034700102:204"/>
unexperienced youth ſtill betrayed by his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and language his ruſtic education, when, to his own aſtoniſhment as well as that of the world, he was inveſted by Diocletian with the purple, exalted to the dignity of Caeſar, and intruſted with the ſovereign command of Egypt and Syria <note n="5" place="bottom">Sublatus nuper a pecoribus et ſilvis (ſays Lactantius de M. P. c. 19.) ſtatim Scutarius, continuo Protector, mox Tribunus, poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridie Caeſar, accepit Orientem. Aurelius Victor is too liberal in giving him the whole portion of Diocletian.</note>. At the ſame time, Severus, a faithful ſervant, addicted to pleaſure, but not incapable of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was ſent to Milan, to receive from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant hands of Maximian the Caeſarean orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the poſſeſſion of Italy and Africa <note n="6" place="bottom">His diligence and fidelity are acknowledged even by Lactantius, de M.

According to the forms of the conſtitution, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus acknowledged the ſupremacy of the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern emperor; but he was abſolutely devoted to the commands of his benefactor Galerius, who, reſerving to himſelf the intermediate countries from the confines of Italy to thoſe of Syria, firmly eſtabliſhed his power over three-fourths of the monarchy. In the full confidence, that the approaching death of Conſtantius would leave him ſole maſter of the Roman world, we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that he had arranged in his mind a long ſucceſſion of future princes, and that he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated his own retreat from public life, after he ſhould have accompliſhed a glorious reign of about twenty years <note n="7" place="bottom">Theſe ſchemes, however, reſt only on the very doubtful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Lactantius, de M.

But within leſs than eighteen months, two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected revolutions overturned the ambitious ſchemes of Galerius. The hopes of uniting the <note place="margin">Ambition of Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by two revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</note> weſtern provinces to his empire, were diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the elevation of Conſtantine, whilſt Italy and Africa were loſt by the ſucceſsful revolt of Maxentius.</p>

D. 274.</note> attentive to the moſt minute circumſtances of his life and actions. The place of his birth, as well as the condition of his mother Helena, have been the ſubject not only of literary but of national diſputes. Notwithſtanding the recent tradition, which aſſigns for her father, a Britiſh king, we are obliged to confeſs, that Helena was the daughter of an innkeeper <note n="8" place="bottom">This tradition, unknown to the contemporaries of Conſtantine, was invented in the darkneſs of monaſteries, was embelliſhed by Jeffrey of Monmouth, and the writers of the xiith century, has been defended by our antiquarians of the laſt age, and is ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the ponderous hiſtory of England, compiled by Mr. Carte (vol. i. p. 147.). He tranſports, however, the kingdom of Coil, the imaginary father of Helena, from Eſſex to the wall of Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus.</note>; but at the ſame time we may defend the legality of her marriage, againſt thoſe who have repreſented her as the concubine of Conſtantius <note n="9" place="bottom">Eutropius (x. 2.) expreſſes, in a few words, the real truth, and the occaſion of the error, "ex obſcuriori matrimonio ejus filius." Zoſimus (l. ii. p. 78.) eagerly ſeized the moſt unfavourable report, and is followed by Oroſius (vii. 25.), whoſe authority is oddly enough overlooked by the indefatigable but partial Tillemont. By inſiſting on the divorce of Helena, Diocletian acknowledged her marriage.</note>. The great Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine was moſt probably born at Naiſſus, in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia <note n="10" place="bottom">There are three opinions with regard to the place of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's birth. 1. Our Engliſh antiquarians were uſed to dwell with rapture on the words of his panegyriſt; <q>Britannias illic oriendo nobiles feciſti.</q> But this celebrated paſſage may be referred with as much propriety to the acceſſion as to the nativity of Conſtantine. 2. Some of the modern Greeks have aſcribed the honour of his birth to Drepanum, a town on the gulph of Nicomedia (Cellarius, tom. ii. p. 174.), which Conſtantine dignified with the name of Helenopolis, and Juſtinian adorned with many ſplendid buildings (Procop. de Aedificiis, v. 2.). It is indeed probable enough, that Helena's father kept an inn at Drepanum; and that Conſtantius might lodge there when he returned from a Perſian embaſſy in the reign of Aurelian. But in the wandering life of a ſoldier, the place of his marriage, and the places where his children are born, have very little connection with each other. 3. The claim of Naiſſus is ſupported by the anonymous writer, publiſhed at the end of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus, p. 710, and who in general copied very good materials; and it is confirmed by Julius Firmicius (de Aſtrologiâ, l. i. c. 4.), who flouriſhed under the reign of Conſtantine himſelf. Some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections have been raiſed againſt the integrity of the text, and the application of the paſſage of Firmicius; but the former is eſtabliſhed by the beſt MSS. and the latter is very ably defended by Lipſius de Magnitudine Romana, l. iv. c. 11. et Supplement.</note>;

and it is not ſurpriſing, that in a family and province diſtinguiſhed only by the profeſſion of arms, the youth ſhould diſcover very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to improve his mind by the acquiſition of knowledge <note n="11" place="bottom">Literis minus inſtructus. Anonym. ad Ammian. p. 710.</note>. He was about eighteen years <note place="margin">A. D. 292.</note> of age when his father was promoted to the rank of Caeſar; but that fortunate event was attended with his mother's divorce; and the ſplendour of an Imperial alliance reduced the ſon of Helena to a ſtate of diſgrace and humiliation. Inſtead of following Conſtantius in the Weſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the ſervice of Diocletian, ſignalized his valour in the wars of Egypt and Perſia, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0034700102:207"/>
gradually roſe to the honourable ſtation of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the firſt order. The figure of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius was tall and majeſtic; he was dexterous in all his exerciſes, intrepid in war, affable in peace; in his whole conduct, the active ſpirit of youth was tempered by habitual prudence; and while his mind was engroſſed by ambition, he appeared cold and inſenſible to the allurements of pleaſure. The favour of the people and ſoldiers, who had named him as a worthy candidate for the rank of Caeſar, ſerved only to exaſperate the jealouſy of Galerius; and though prudence might reſtrain him from exerciſing any open violence, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute monarch is ſeldom at a loſs how to execute a ſure and ſecret revenge <note n="12" place="bottom">Galerius, or perhaps his own courage, expoſed him to ſingle combat with a Sarmatian (Anonym. p. 710.) and with a monſtrous lion.

He ended his life in the Imperial palace of York, fifteen months after he had received the title of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, and almoſt fourteen years and a half after he had been promoted to the rank of Caeſar. His death was immediately ſucceeded by the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Conſtantine. The ideas of inheritance and ſucceſſion are ſo very familiar, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of mankind conſider them as founded, not only in reaſon, but in nature itſelf. Our imagination readily transfers the ſame principles from private property to public dominion: and whenever a virtuous father leaves behind him a ſon whoſe merit ſeems to juſtify the eſteem, or even the hopes of the people, the joint influence of prejudice and of affection operates with irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible

weight. The flower of the weſtern armies had followed Conſtantius into Britain, and the national troops were reinforced by a numerous body of Alemanni, who obeyed the orders of Crocus, one of their hereditary chieftains <note n="15" place="bottom">Cunctis qui aderant annitentibus, ſed praecipue Croco <hi>(alii Eroco)</hi> Alamannorum Rege, auxilii gratiâ Conſtantium comitato, imperium capit. Victor Junior, c. 41. This is perhaps the firſt inſtance of a barbarian king, who aſſiſted the Roman arms with an independent body of his own ſubjects. The practice grew familiar, and at laſt became fatal.</note>. The opinion of their own importance, and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that Britain, Gaul, and Spain would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in their nomination, were diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated to the legions by the adherents of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine. The ſoldiers were aſked, Whether they could heſitate a moment between the honour of placing at their head the worthy ſon of their beloved emperor, and the ignominy of tamely expecting the arrival of ſome obſcure ſtranger, on whom it might pleaſe the ſovereign of Aſia to beſtow the armies and provinces of the Weſt. It was inſinuated to them, that gratitude and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality held a diſtinguiſhed place among the virtues of Conſtantine; nor did that artful prince ſhew himſelf to the troops, till they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſalute him with the names of Auguſtus and Emperor. The throne was the object of his deſires; and had he been leſs actuated by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was his only means of ſafety.

Conſtantine informed him of the melancholy event of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death, modeſtly aſſerted his natural claim to the ſucceſſion, and reſpectfully lamented, that the affectionate violence of his troops had not permitted him to ſolicit the Imperial purple in the regular and conſtitutional manner. The firſt emotions of Galerius were thoſe of ſurpriſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, and rage; and as he could ſeldom reſtrain his paſſions, he loudly threatened, that he would commit to the flames both the letter and the meſſenger. But his reſentment inſenſibly <note place="margin">He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius, who gives him only the title of Caeſar, and that of Auguſtus to Severus.</note> ſubſided; and when he recollected the doubtful chance of war, when he had weighed the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and ſtrength of his adverſary, he conſented to embrace the honourable accommodation which the prudence of Conſtantine had left open to him. Without either condemning or ratifying the choice of the Britiſh army, Galerius accepted the ſon of his deceaſed colleague, as the ſovereign of the provinces beyond the Alps; but he gave him only the title of Caeſar, and the fourth rank among the Roman princes, whilſt he conferred the vacant place of Auguſtus on his favourite

The ambitious ſpirit of Galerius was <note place="margin">Diſcontent of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans at the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of taxes.</note> ſcarcely reconciled to the diſappointment of his views upon the Gallic provinces, before the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected loſs of Italy wounded his pride as well as power in a ſtill more ſenſible part. The long abſence of the emperors had filled Rome with diſcontent and indignation; and the people gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually diſcovered, that the preference given to Nicomedia and Milan, was not to be aſcribed to the particular inclination of Diocletian, but to the permanent form of government which he had inſtituted. It was in vain that, a few months after his abdication, his ſucceſſors dedicated, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his name, thoſe magnificent baths, whoſe ruins ſtill ſupply the ground as well as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for ſo many churches and convents <note n="20" place="bottom">See Gruter Inſcrip. p. 178. The ſix princes are all mentioned, Diocletian and Maximian as the ſenior Auguſti and fathers of the emperors. They jointly dedicate, for the uſe of <hi>their own</hi> Romans, this magnificent edifice. The architects have delineated the ruins of theſe <hi>Thermae;</hi> and the antiquarians, particularly Donatus and Nardini, have aſcertained the ground which they covered. One of the great rooms is now the Carthuſian church; and even one of the porter's lodges is ſufficient to form another church, which belongs to the Feuillans.</note>. The tranquillity of thoſe elegant receſſes of eaſe and luxury was diſturbed by the impatient mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of the Romans; and a report was inſenſibly
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0034700102:213"/>
circulated, that the ſums expended in erecting thoſe buildings, would ſoon be required at their hands. About that time the avarice of Galerius, or perhaps the exigencies of the ſtate, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to make a very ſtrict and rigorous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition into the property of his ſubjects for the purpoſe of a general taxation, both on their lands and on their perſons. A very minute ſurvey ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been taken of their real eſtates; and wherever there was the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion of concealment, torture was very freely employed to obtain a ſincere declaration of their perſonal wealth <note n="21" place="bottom">See Lactantius de M. P. c. 26. 31.</note>. The privileges which had exalted Italy above the rank of the provinces, were no longer regarded: and the officers of the revenue already began to number the Roman people, and to ſettle the proportion of the new taxes. Even when the ſpirit of freedom had been utterly extinguiſhed, the tameſt ſubjects have ſometimes ventured to reſiſt an unprecedented invaſion of their property; but on this occaſion the injury was aggravated by the inſult, and the ſenſe of private intereſt was quickened by that of national honour. The conqueſt of Macedonia, as we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, had delivered the Roman people from the weight of perſonal taxes. Though they had experienced every form of deſpotiſm, they had now enjoyed that exemption near five hundred years; nor could they patiently brook the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of an Illyrian peaſant, who, from his diſtant reſidence in Aſia, preſumed to number Rome
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0034700102:214"/>
among the tributary cities of his empire. The riſing fury of the people was encouraged by the authority, or at leaſt the connivance, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and the feeble remains of the Praetorian guards, who had reaſon to apprehend their own diſſolution, embraced ſo honourable a pretence, and declared their readineſs to draw their ſwords in the ſervice of their oppreſſed country. It was the wiſh, and it ſoon became the hope, of every citizen, that after expelling from Italy their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign tyrants, they ſhould elect a prince who, by the place of his reſidence, and by his maxims of government, might once more deſerve the title of Roman emperor. The name, as well as the ſituation, of Maxentius, determined in his favour the popular enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>Maxentius was the ſon of the emperor Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, <note place="margin">Maxentius declared emperor at Rome. A. D. 306. 28th Oct.</note> and he had married the daughter of Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. His birth and alliance ſeemed to offer him the faireſt promiſe of ſucceeding to the empire; but his vices and incapacity procured him the ſame excluſion from the dignity of Caeſar, which Conſtantine had deſerved by a dangerous ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of merit. The policy of Galerius pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſuch aſſociates, as would never diſgrace the choice, nor diſpute the commands of their benefactor. An obſcure ſtranger was therefore raiſed to the throne of Italy, and the ſon of the late emperor of the Weſt was left to enjoy the luxury of a private fortune in a villa a few miles diſtant from the capital. The gloomy paſſions of his ſoul, ſhame, vexation, and rage were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by envy on the news of Conſtantine's ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0034700102:215"/>
but the hopes of Maxentius revived with the public diſcontent, and he was eaſily perſuaded to unite his perſonal injury and pretenſions with the cauſe of the Roman people. Two Praetorian tribunes and a commiſſary of proviſions under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the management of the conſpiracy; and as every order of men was actuated by the ſame ſpirit, the immediate event was neither doubtful nor difficult. The praefect of the city, and a few magiſtrates, who maintained their fidelity to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus, were maſſacred by the guards; and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius, inveſted with the Imperial ornaments, was acknowledged by the applauding ſenate and people as the protector of the Roman freedom and dignity. It is uncertain whether Maximian was previouſly acquainted with the conſpiracy; but as ſoon as the ſtandard of rebellion was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Rome, the old emperor broke from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement <note place="margin">Maximian re-aſſumes the purple.</note> where the authority of Diocletian had condemned him to paſs a life of melancholy ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and concealed his returning ambition under the diſguiſe of paternal tenderneſs.

According to the advice, or rather the orders, of his colleague, the emperor Severus immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately haſtened to Rome, in the full confidence, <note place="margin">Defeat and death of Severus.</note> that, by his unexpected celerity, he ſhould eaſily ſuppreſs the tumult of an unwarlike populace, commanded by a licentious youth. But he found on his arrival the gates of the city ſhut againſt him, the walls filled with men and arms, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced general at the head of the rebels, and his own troops without ſpirit or affection. A large body of Moors deſerted to the enemy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by the promiſe of a large donative; and, if it be true that they had been levied by Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian in his African war, preferring the natural feelings of gratitude to the artificial ties of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance. Anulinus, the Praetorian praefect, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf in favour of Maxentius, and drew after him the moſt conſiderable part of the troops, accuſtomed to obey his commands. Rome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the expreſſion of an orator, recalled her armies; and the unfortunate Severus, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of force and of counſel, retired, or rather fled, with precipitation to Ravenna. Here he might for ſome time have been ſafe. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of Ravenna were able to reſiſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and the moraſſes that ſurrounded the town were ſufficient to prevent the approach, of the Italian army. The ſea, which Severus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with a powerful fleet, ſecured him an inexhauſtible ſupply of proviſions, and gave a free entrance to the legions, which, on the return of ſpring, would advance to his aſſiſtance from
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0034700102:217"/>
Illyricum and the Eaſt. Maximian, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the ſiege in perſon, was ſoon convinced that he might waſte his time and his army in the fruitleſs enterpriſe, and that he had nothing to hope either from force or famine. With an art more ſuitable to the character of Diocletian than to his own, he directed his attack, not ſo much againſt the walls of Ravenna, as againſt the mind of Severus. The treachery which he had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, diſpoſed that unhappy prince to diſtruſt the moſt ſincere of his friends and adherents. The emiſſaries of Maximian eaſily perſuaded his credulity, that a conſpiracy was formed to betray the town, and prevailed upon his fears not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to the diſcretion of an irritated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, but to accept the faith of an honourable capitulation. He was at firſt received with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and treated with reſpect. Maximian conducted the captive emperor to Rome, and gave him the moſt ſolemn aſſurances that he had ſecured his life by the reſignation of the purple. But Severus could obtain only an eaſy death and an Imperial funeral. When the ſentence was <note place="margin">A. D. 307.

Though the characters of Conſtantine and Maxentius had very little affinity with each other, their ſituation and intereſt were the ſame; and <note place="margin">Maximian gives his daughter Fauſta, and the title of Auguſtus, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſuperiority of his age and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the indefatigable Maximian paſſed the Alps, and courting a perſonal interview with the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of Gaul, carried with him his daughter Fauſta as the pledge of the new alliance. The marriage was celebrated at Arles with every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of magnificence; and the ancient col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league of Diocletian, who again aſſerted his claim to the weſtern empire, conferred on his ſon-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law and ally the title of Auguſtus. By conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive that honour from Maximian, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine ſeemed to embrace the cauſe of Rome and of the ſenate; but his profeſſions were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, and his aſſiſtance ſlow and ineffectual.

Romans; or, as he expreſſed his intentions, in the furious language of a barbarian, to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the ſenate, and to deſtroy the people by the ſword. But the ſkill of Maximian had concerted a prudent ſyſtem of defence. The invader found every place hoſtile, fortified, and inacceſſible; and though he forced his way as far as Narni, within ſixty miles of Rome, his dominion in Italy was confined to the narrow limits of his camp. Senſible of the increaſing difficulties of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, the haughty Galerius made the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances towards a reconciliation, and diſpatched two of his moſt conſiderable officers to tempt the Roman princes by the offer of a conference and the declaration of his paternal regard for Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, who might obtain much more from his liberality than he could hope from the doubtful chance of war <note n="25" place="bottom">With regard to this negociation, ſee the fragments of an ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Hiſtorian, publiſhed by Valeſius at the end of his edition of Ammianus Marcellinus, p. 711. Theſe fragments have furniſhed us with ſeveral curious, and as it ſhould ſeem authentic, anecdotes.</note>. The offers of Galerius were rejected with firmneſs, his perfidious friendſhip refuſed with contempt, and it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he diſcovered, that, unleſs he provided for his ſafety by a timely retreat, he had ſome reaſon to apprehend the fate of Severus. The wealth, which the Romans defended againſt his rapacious tyranny, they freely contributed for his deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The name of Maximian, the popular arts of his ſon, the ſecret diſtribution of large ſums, and the promiſe of ſtill more liberal rewards,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0034700102:220"/>
checked the ardour, and corrupted the fidelity of the Illyrian legions; and when Galerius at length gave the ſignal of the retreat, it was with ſome difficulty that he could prevail on his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans not to deſert a banner which had ſo often conducted them to victory and honour. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary writer aſſigns two other cauſes for the failure of the expedition; but they are both of ſuch a nature, that a cautious hiſtorian will ſcarcely venture to adopt them. We are told that Galerius, who had formed a very imperfect notion of the greatneſs of Rome by the cities of the Eaſt, with which he was acquainted, found his forces inadequate to the ſiege of that immenſe capital. But the extent of a city ſerves only to render it more acceſſible to the enemy; Rome had long ſince been accuſtomed to ſubmit on the approach of a conqueror; nor could the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary enthuſiaſm of the people have long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt the diſcipline and valour of the legions. We are likewiſe informed, that the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions themſelves were ſtruck with horror and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, and that thoſe pious ſons of the republic refuſed to violate the ſanctity of their venerable parent <note n="26" place="bottom">Lactantius de M.

diſtruſt this extreme delicacy of ſtrangers and barbarians, who had never beheld Italy, till they entered it in a hoſtile manner.

veterans. His father had undertaken a ſecond journey into Gaul, with the hope of perſuading Conſtantine, who had aſſembled an army on the frontier, to join the purſuit and to complete the victory. But the actions of Conſtantine were guided by reaſon and not by reſentment. He perſiſted in the wiſe reſolution of maintaining a balance of power in the divided empire, and he no longer hated Galerius, when that aſpiring prince had ceaſed to be an object of terror <note n="23" place="bottom">Lactantius de M.

            <p>The mind of Galerius was the moſt ſuſceptible <note place="margin">Elevation of Licinius to the rank of Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</note> of the ſterner paſſions, but it was not however incapable of a ſincere and laſting friendſhip. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius, whoſe manners as well as character were <note place="margin">A. D. 307. Nov. 11.</note> not unlike his own, ſeems to have engaged both his affection and eſteem. Their intimacy had commenced in the happier period perhaps of their youth and obſcurity. It had been cemented by the freedom and dangers of a military life; they had advanced, almoſt by equal ſteps, through the ſucceſſive honours of the ſervice; and as ſoon as Galerius was inveſted with the Imperial dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he ſeems to have conceived the deſign of raiſing his companion to the ſame rank with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. During the ſhort period of his proſperity, he conſidered the rank of Caeſar as unworthy of the age and merit of Licinius, and rather choſe to reſerve for him the place of Conſtantius, and the empire of the Weſt. While the emperor
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0034700102:223"/>
was employed in the Italian war, he intruſted his friend with the defence of the Danube; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after his return from that unfortunate expedition, he inveſted Licinius with the vacant purple of Severus, reſigning to his immediate command the provinces of Illyricum <note n="29" place="bottom">M. de Tillemont (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. iv. part i. p. 559.) has proved, that Licinius, without paſſing through the intermediate rank of Caeſar, was declared Auguſtus, the 11th of November, A.

The <note place="margin">and of Maximin.</note> news of his promotion was no ſooner carried into the Eaſt, than Maximin, who governed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppreſſed, the countries of Egypt and Syria, betrayed his envy and diſcontent, diſdained the inferior name of Caeſar, and notwithſtanding the prayers as well as arguments of Galerius, exacted, almoſt by violence, the equal title of Auguſtus <note n="30" place="bottom">Lactantius de M. P. c. 32. When Galerius declared Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius Auguſtus with himſelf, he tried to ſatisfy his younger aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, by inventing, for Conſtantine and <hi>Maximin</hi> (not <hi>Maxentius,</hi> ſee Baluze, p. 81.) the new title of ſons of the Auguſti. But when Maximin acquainted him that he had been ſaluted Auguſtus by the army, Galerius was obliged to acknowledge him, as well as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, as equal aſſociates in the Imperial dignity.</note>. For the firſt, and indeed for the laſt time, the Roman world was adminiſtered by ſix emperors. In the Weſt, Conſtantine and Maxentius affected <note place="margin">Six empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. A. D. 308.</note> to reverence their father Maximian. In the Eaſt, Licinius and Maximin honoured with more real conſideration their benefactor Galerius. The oppoſition of intereſt, and the memory of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent war, divided the empire into two great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile powers; but their mutual fears produced an apparent tranquillity, and even a feigned recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0034700102:224"/>
till the death of the elder princes, of Maximian, and more particularly of Galerius, gave a new direction to the views and paſſions of their ſurviving aſſociates.</p>
            <p>When Maximian had reluctantly abdicated the <note place="margin">Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> empire, the venal orators of the times applauded his philoſophic moderation.

But it was impoſſible, that minds like thoſe of Maximian and his ſon, could long poſſeſs in harmony an undivided power.

An incurſion of the Franks had ſummoned Conſtantine, with a part of his army, to the banks of the Rhine; the remainder of the troops were ſtationed in the ſouthern provinces of Gaul, which lay expoſed to the enterpriſes of the Italian emperor, and a conſiderable treaſure was depoſited in the city of Arles. Maximian either craftily invented, or haſtily credited, a vain report of the death of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0034700102:226"/>
Conſtantine. Without heſitation he aſcended the throne, ſeized the treaſure, and ſcattering it with his accuſtomed profuſion among the ſoldiers, endeavoured to awake in their minds the memory of his ancient dignity and exploits. Before he could eſtabliſh his authority, or finiſh the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation which he appears to have entered into with his ſon Maxentius, the celerity of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine defeated all his hopes. On the firſt news of his perfidy and ingratitude, that prince returned by rapid marches from the Rhine to the Saone, embarked on the laſt mentioned river at Chalons, and at Lyons truſting himſelf to the rapidity of the Rhone, arrived at the gates of Arles, with a military force which it was impoſſible for Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imian to reſiſt, and which ſcarcely permitted him to take refuge in the neighbouring city of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles. The narrow neck of land which joined that place to the continent was fortified againſt the beſiegers, whilſt the ſea was open, either for the eſcape of Maximian, or for the ſuccours of Maxentius, if the latter ſhould chuſe to diſguiſe his invaſion of Gaul, under the honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of defending a diſtreſſed, or, as he might allege, an injured father. Apprehenſive of the fatal conſequences of delay, Conſtantine gave orders for an immediate aſſault; but the ſcaling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladders were found too ſhort for the height of the walls, and Marſeilles might have ſuſtained as long a ſiege as it formerly did againſt the arms of Caeſar, if the garriſon, conſcious either of their fault or of their danger, had not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed

The Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont and the Thracian Boſphorus formed their mutual boundary, and the banks of thoſe narrow ſeas, which flowed in the midſt of the Roman world, were covered with ſoldiers, with arms, and with fortifications. The deaths of Maximian and of Galerius reduced the number of emperors to four.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0034700102:230"/>
action which may be aſcribed to their virtue. In the ſixth year of his reign, Conſtantine viſited the city of Autun, and generouſly remitted the arrears of tribute, reducing at the ſame time the proportion of their aſſeſſment, from twenty-five to eighteen thouſand heads, ſubject to the real and perſonal capitation <note n="40" place="bottom">See the viiith Panegyr. in which Eumenius diſplays, in the preſence of Conſtantine, the miſery and the gratitude of the city of Autun.</note>. Yet even this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence affords the moſt unqueſtionable proof of the public miſery. This tax was ſo extremely oppreſſive, either in itſelf or in the mode of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting it, that whilſt the revenue was increaſed by extortion, it was diminiſhed by deſpair: a conſiderable part of the territory of Autun was left uncultivated; and great numbers of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials rather choſe to live as exiles and outlaws, than to ſupport the weight of civil ſociety. It is but too probable, that the bountiful emperor relieved, by a partial act of liberality, one among the many evils which he had cauſed by his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral maxims of adminiſtration. But even thoſe maxims were leſs the effect of choice than of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. And if we except the death of Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, the reign of Conſtantine in Gaul ſeems to have been the moſt innocent and even virtuous period of his life.

Whilſt the Gallic provinces enjoyed as much happineſs as the condition of the times was capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, Italy and Africa groaned under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a tyrant as contemptible as he was odious.

The ſtate of the capital was no leſs deſerving of compaſſion than that of Africa. The wealth of Rome ſupplied an inexhauſtible fund for his vain and prodigal expences, and the miniſters of his revenue were ſkilled in the arts of rapine. It was under his reign that the method of exacting a <hi>free gift</hi> from the ſenators was firſt invented; and as the ſum was inſenſibly increaſed, the pretences of levying it, a victory, a birth, a marriage, or an Imperial conſulſhip, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably multiplied <note n="44" place="bottom">The paſſage of Aurelius Victor ſhould be read in the following manner.

Yet his pride was equal to his other vices. Whilſt he paſſed his indolent life, either within the walls of his palace, or in the neighbouring gardens of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſt, he was repeatedly heard to declare, that <hi>he alone</hi> was emperor, and that the other princes were no more than his lieutenants, on whom he

Maxentius, who openly avowed his pretenſions to the whole monarchy of the Weſt, had already prepared a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able force to invade the Gallic provinces on the ſide of Rhaetia; and though he could not expect any aſſiſtance from Licinius, he was flattered with the hope that the legions of Illyricum, allured by his preſents and promiſes, would deſert the ſtandard of that prince, and unanimouſly declare themſelves his ſoldiers and ſubjects <note n="49" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. ii. p. 84, 85.

There appeared the ſame difference between the leaders as between the armies. Caprice or flattery had tempted Maxentius with the hopes of conqueſt; but theſe aſpiring hopes ſoon gave way to the habits of pleaſure and the conſciouſneſs of his inexperience.

The horſes, as well as the men, were clothed in complete armour, the joints of which were artfully adapted to the motions of their bodies. The aſpect of this cavalry was formidable, their weight almoſt irreſiſtible; and as, on this occaſion, their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals had drawn them up in a compact column or wedge, with a ſharp point, and with ſpreading
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0034700102:240"/>
flanks, they flattered themſelves that they ſhould eaſily break and trample down the army of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine. They might perhaps have ſucceeded in their deſign, had not their experienced ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary embraced the ſame method of defence, which in ſimilar circumſtances had been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by Aurelian. The ſkilful evolutions of Conſtantine divided and baffled this maſſy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of cavalry. The troops of Maxentius fled in confuſion towards Turin; and as the gates of the city were ſhut againſt them, very few eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſword of the victorious purſuers. By this important ſervice, Turin deſerved to experience the clemency and even favour of the conqueror. He made his entry into the Imperial palace of Milan, and almoſt all the cities of Italy between the Alps and the Po not only acknowledged the power, but embraced with zeal the party, of Conſtantine <note n="56" place="bottom">Zoſimus as well as Euſebius haſten from the paſſage of the Alps, to the deciſive action near Rome.

            <p>From Milan to Rome, the Aemilian and Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian <note place="margin">Siege and battle of Verona.</note> highways offered an eaſy march of about four hundred miles; but though Conſtantine was impatient to encounter the tyrant, he pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently directed his operations againſt another army of Italians, who, by their ſtrength and poſition, might either oppoſe his progreſs, or, in caſe of a misfortune, might intercept his retreat. Ruricius Pompeianus, a general diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by his valour and ability, had under his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0034700102:241"/>
command the city of Verona, and all the troops that were ſtationed in the province of Venetia. As ſoon as he was informed that Conſtantine was advancing towards him, he detached a large body of cavalry, which was defeated in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement near Breſcia, and purſued by the Gallic legions as far as the gates of Verona. The neceſſity, the importance, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſiege of Verona, immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves to the ſagacious mind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine <note n="57" place="bottom">The Marquis Maffei has examined the ſiege and battle of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona, with that degree of attention and accuracy, which was due to a memorable action that happened in his native country. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of that city, conſtructed by Gallienus, were leſs extenſive than the modern walls, and the Amphitheatre was not included within their circumference. See Verona Illuſtrata, Part i. p. 142. 150.</note> The city was acceſſible only by a narrow peninſula towards the weſt, as the other three ſides were ſurrounded by the Adige, a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid river which covered the province of Venetia, from whence the beſieged derived an inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupply of men and proviſions. It was not without great difficulty, and after ſeveral fruitleſs attempts, that Conſtantine found means to paſs the river at ſome diſtance above the city, and in a place where the torrent was leſs violent. He then encompaſſed Verona with ſtrong lines, puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his attacks with prudent vigour, and repelled a deſperate ſally of Pompeianus. That intrepid general, when he had uſed every means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that the ſtrength of the place or that of the garriſon could afford, ſecretly eſcaped from Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0034700102:242"/>
anxious not for his own but for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſafety. With indefatigable diligence he ſoon collected an army ſufficient either to meet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine in the field, or to attack him if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately remained within his lines. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, attentive to the motions, and informed of the approach, of ſo formidable an enemy, left a part of his legions to continue the operations of the ſiege, whilſt, at the head of thoſe troops on whoſe valour and fidelity he more particularly depended, he advanced in perſon to engage the general of Maxentius. The army of Gaul was drawn up in two lines, according to the uſual practice of war; but their experienced leader, perceiving that the numbers of the Italians far exceeded his own, ſuddenly changed his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reducing the ſecond, extended the front of his firſt line, to a juſt proportion with that of the enemy. Such evolutions, which only veteran troops can execute without confuſion in a moment of danger, commonly prove deciſive: but as this engagement began towards the cloſe of the day, and was conteſted with great obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy during the whole night, there was leſs room for the conduct of the generals than for the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the ſoldiers. The return of light diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the victory of Conſtantine, and a field of carnage covered with many thouſands of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed Italians.

When the officers of the victorious army congratulated their maſter on this important ſucceſs, they ventured to add ſome reſpectful complaints, of ſuch a nature, however, as the moſt jealous monarchs will liſten to without diſpleaſure. They repreſented to Conſtantine, that, not contented with perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the duties of a commander, he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his own perſon with an exceſs of valour which almoſt degenerated into raſhneſs; and they conjured him for the future to pay more regard to the preſervation of a life, in which the ſafety of Rome and of the empire was involved <note n="59" place="bottom">Panegyr.

            <p>While Conſtantine ſignalized his conduct and <note place="margin">Indolence and fears of Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> valour in the field, the ſovereign of Italy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſenſible of the calamities and danger of a civil was which raged in the heart of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

was ſcarcely ſufficient to awaken him from this fatal ſecurity; he flattered himſelf, that his well-known liberality, and the majeſty of the Roman name, which had already delivered him from two invaſions, would diſſipate with the ſame facility the rebellious army of Gaul. The officers of experience and ability, who had ſerved under the banners of Maximian, were at length compelled to inform his effeminate ſon of the imminent danger to which he was reduced; and, with a freedom that at once ſurpriſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him, to urge the neceſſity of preventing his ruin, by a vigorous exertion of his remaining power. The reſources of Maxentius, both of men and money, were ſtill conſiderable. The Praetorian guards felt how ſtrongly their own intereſt and ſafety were connected with his cauſe; and a third army was ſoon collected, more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than thoſe which had been loſt in the battles of Turin and Verona. It was far from the intention of the emperor to lead his troops in perſon. A ſtranger to the exerciſes of war, he trembled at the apprehenſion of ſo dangerous a conteſt; and as fear is commonly ſuperſtitious, he liſtened with melancholy attention to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of omens and preſages which ſeemed to menace his life and empire. Shame at length ſupplied the place of courage, and forced him to take the field. He was unable to ſuſtain the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0034700102:245"/>
contempt of the Roman people. The circus reſounded with their indignant clamours, and they tumultuouſly beſieged the gates of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, reproaching the puſillanimity of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent ſovereign, and celebrating the heroic ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Conſtantine <note n="63" place="bottom">See Panegyr. Vet. xi. 16. Lactantius de M. P. c. 44.</note>. Before Maxentius left Rome, he conſulted the Sibylline books. The guardians of theſe ancient oracles were as well verſed in the arts of this world, as they were ignorant of the ſecrets of fate; and they returned him a very prudent anſwer, which might adapt itſelf to the event, and ſecure their reputation whatever ſhould be the chance of arms <note n="64" place="bottom">Illo die hoſtem Romanorum eſſe periturum.

Conſtantine had always apprehended that the tyrant would conſult the dictates of fear, and perhaps of prudence; and that, inſtead of riſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his laſt hopes in a general engagement, he would ſhut himſelf up within the walls of Rome. His ample magazines ſecured him againſt the danger of famine; and as the ſituation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine admitted not of delay, he might have been reduced to the ſad neceſſity of deſtroying with fire and ſword the Imperial city, the nobleſt reward of his victory, and the deliverance of

Their long front filled a very ſpacious plain, and their deep array reached to the banks of the Tyber, which cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their rear, and forbade their retreat. We are informed, and we may believe, that Conſtantine diſpoſed his troops with conſummate ſkill, and that he choſe for himſelf the poſt of honour and danger. Diſtinguiſhed by the ſplendour of his arms, he charged in perſon the cavalry of his rival; and his irreſiſtible attack determined the fortune of the day. The cavalry of Maxentius was principally compoſed either of unwieldy cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſiers, or of light Moors and Numidians. They yielded to the vigour of the Gallic horſe, which poſſeſſed more activity than the one, more firmneſs than the other. The defeat of the two wings left the infantry without any protection on
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0034700102:247"/>
its flanks, and the undiſciplined Italians fled without reluctance from the ſtandard of a tyrant whom they had always hated, and whom they no longer feared. The Praetorians, conſcious that their offences were beyond the reach of mercy, were animated by revenge and deſpair. Notwithſtanding their repeated efforts, thoſe brave veterans were unable to recover the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: they obtained, however, an honourable death; and it was obſerved, that their bodies covered the ſame ground which had been occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by their ranks <note n="68" place="bottom">Exceptis latrocinii illius primis auctoribus, qui deſperatâ veniâ, locum quem pugnae ſumpſerant texere corporibus.

The confuſion then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came general, and the diſmayed troops of Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius, purſued by an implacable enemy, ruſhed by thouſands into the deep and rapid ſtream of the Tyber.

He inflicted the ſame treatment, to which a defeat would have expoſed his own perſon and family, put to death the two ſons of the tyrant, and carefully extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated his whole race. The moſt diſtinguiſhed adherents of Maxentius muſt have expected to ſhare his fate, as they had ſhared his proſperity and his crimes; but when the Roman people loudly demanded a greater number of victims, the conqueror reſiſted, with firmneſs and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, thoſe ſervile clamours which were dictated by flattery as well as by reſentment. Informers were puniſhed and diſcouraged; the innocent, who had ſuffered under the late tyranny, were recalled from exile, and reſtored to their eſtates.

A general act of oblivion quieted the minds and ſettled the property of the people, both in Italy and in Africa <note n="72" place="bottom">See the two Panegyrics, and the laws of this and the enſuing year, in the Theodoſian Code.</note>. The firſt time that Conſtantine honoured the ſenate with his preſence, he reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated his own ſervices and exploits in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt oration, aſſured that illuſtrious order of his ſincere regard, and promiſed to re-eſtabliſh its ancient dignity and privileges. The grateful ſenate repaid theſe unmeaning profeſſions by the empty titles of honour, which it was yet in their power to beſtow; and without preſuming to ratify the authority of Conſtantine, they paſſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to aſſign him the firſt rank among the three <hi>Auguſti</hi> who governed the Roman world <note n="73" place="bottom">Panegyr.

Games and feſtivals were inſtituted to preſerve the fame of his victory, and ſeveral edifices raiſed at the expence of Maxentius, were dedicated to the honour of his ſucceſsful rival. The triumphal arch of Conſtantine ſtill remains a melancholy proof of the decline of the arts, and a ſingular teſtimony of the meaneſt vanity. As it was not poſſible to find in the capital of the empire, a ſculptor who was capable of adorning that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic monument; the arch of Trajan, without any reſpect either for his memory or for the rules of propriety, was ſtripped of its moſt elegant figures.

Parthian captives appear proſtrate at the feet of a prince who never carried his arms beyond the Euphrates; and curious antiquarians can ſtill diſcover the head of Trajan on the trophies of Conſtantine.

            <p>The final abolition of the Praetorian guards <note place="margin">and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct at Rome.</note> was a meaſure of prudence as well as of revenge. Thoſe haughty troops, whoſe numbers and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges had been reſtored, and even augmented, by Maxentius, were for ever ſuppreſſed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine. Their fortified camp was deſtroyed, and the few Praetorians who had eſcaped the fury of the ſword, were diſperſed among the legions, and baniſhed to the frontiers of the empire, where they might be ſerviceable without again becoming dangerous. <note n="75" place="bottom">Praetoriae legiones ac ſubſidia factionibus aptiora quam urbi Romae, ſublata penitus; ſimul arma atque uſus indumenti militaris.

By ſuppreſſing the troops which were uſually ſtationed in Rome, Conſtantine gave the fatal blow to the dignity of the ſenate and people, and the diſarmed capital was expoſed without protection to the inſults or neglect of its diſtant maſter. We may obſerve,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0034700102:251"/>
that in this laſt effort to preſerve their expiring freedom, the Romans, from the apprehenſion of a tribute, had raiſed Maxentius to the throne. He exacted that tribute from the ſenate under the name of a free gift. They implored the aſſiſtance of Conſtantine. He vanquiſhed the tyrant, and converted the free gift into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual tax. The ſenators, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration which was required of their property, were divided into ſeveral claſſes.

Conſtantine was almoſt
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0034700102:252"/>
perpetually in motion to exerciſe the legions, or to inſpect the ſtate of the provinces. Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Sirmium, Naiſſus, and Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica, were the occaſional places of his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, till he founded a NEW ROME on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Europe and Aſia <note n="77" place="bottom">From the Theodoſian Code, we may now begin to trace the motions of the emperors; but the dates both of time and place have frequently been altered by the careleſſneſs of tranſcribers.</note>.</p>

In the midſt of the public feſtivity they were ſuddenly obliged to take leave of each other. An inroad of the Franks ſummoned Conſtantine to the Rhine, and the hoſtile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the ſovereign of Aſia demanded the immediate preſence of Licinius.

the depth of winter. The ſeaſon was ſevere and tempeſtuous; great numbers of men as well as horſes periſhed in the ſnow; and as the roads were broken up by inceſſant rains, he was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave behind him a conſiderable part of the heavy baggage, which was unable to follow the rapidity of his forced marches. By this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary effort of diligence, he arrived, with a haraſſed but formidable army, on the banks of the Thracian Boſphorus, before the lieutenants of Licinius were appriſed of his hoſtile inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Byzantium ſurrendered to the power of Maximin, after a ſiege of eleven days. He was detained ſome days under the walls of Heraclea; and he had no ſooner taken poſſeſſion of that city, than he was alarmed by the intelligence, that Licinius had pitched his camp at the diſtance of only eighteen miles. After a fruitleſs nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, April 30,</note> in which the two princes attempted to ſeduce the fidelity of each other's adherents, they had recourſe to arms.

His death, which happened at Tarſus, was vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſcribed to deſpair, to poiſon, and to the divine juſtice. As Maximin was alike deſtitute of abilities and of virtue, he was lamented nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the people nor by the ſoldiers. The provinces of the Eaſt, delivered from the terrors of civil war, cheerfully acknowledged the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Licinius <note n="79" place="bottom">Zoſimus mentions the defeat and death of Maximin as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary events: but Lactantius expatiates on them (de M.

            <p>The vanquiſhed emperor left behind him two <note place="margin">Cruelty of Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> children, a boy of about eight, and a girl of about ſeven, years old. Their inoffenſive age might have excited compaſſion; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of Licinius was a very feeble reſource, nor did it reſtrain him from <hi>extinguiſhing</hi> the name and memory of his adverſary. The death of Severianus will admit of leſs excuſe, as it was dictated neither by revenge nor by policy. The conqueror had never received any injury from the father of that unhappy youth, and the ſhort and obſcure reign of Severus in a diſtant part of the empire was already forgotten. But the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Candidianus was an act of the blackeſt cruelty and ingratitude. He was the natural ſon
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0034700102:255"/>
of Galerius, the friend and benefactor of Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. The prudent father had judged him too young to ſuſtain the weight of a diadem; but he hoped that under the protection of princes, who were indebted to his favour for the Imperial purple, Candidianus might paſs a ſecure and honourable life. He was now advancing towards the twentieth year of his age, and the royalty of his birth, though unſupported either by merit or ambition, was ſufficient to exaſperate the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous mind of Licinius <note n="80" place="bottom">Lactantius de M. P. c. 50. Aurelius Victor touches on the different conduct of Licinius, and of Conſtantine, in the uſe of victory.</note>. To theſe innocent and illuſtrious victims of his tyranny, we muſt add the wife and daughter of the emperor Diocletian. When that prince conferred on Galerius the title of Caeſar, he had given him in marriage his daughter Valeria, whoſe melancholy adventures might furniſh a very ſingular ſubject for tragedy. She had fulfilled and even ſurpaſſed the duties of <note place="margin">Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fate of the empreſs Valeria and her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> a wife. As ſhe had not any children herſelf, ſhe condeſcended to adopt the illegitimate ſon of her huſband, and invariably diſplayed towards the unhappy Candidianus the tenderneſs and anxiety of a real mother. After the death of Galerius, her ample poſſeſſions provoked the avarice, and her perſonal attractions excited the deſires, of his ſucceſſor Maximin <note n="81" place="bottom">The ſenſual appetites of Maximin were gratified at the expence of his ſubjects. His eunuchs, who forced away wives and virgins, examined their naked charms with anxious curioſity, leſt any part of their body ſhould be found unworthy of the royal embraces. Coyneſs and diſdain were conſidered as treaſon, and the obſtinate fair one was condemned to be drowned. A cuſtom was gradually introduced, that no perſon ſhould marry a wife without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the emperor, "ut ipſe in omnibus nuptiis praeguſtator eſſet." Lactantius de M. P. c. 38.</note>. He had a wife ſtill alive,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0034700102:256"/>
but divorce was permitted by the Roman law, and the fierce paſſions of the tyrant demanded an immediate gratification. The anſwer of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria was ſuch as became the daughter and widow of emperors; but it was tempered by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which her defenceleſs condition compelled her to obſerve. She repreſented to the perſons whom Maximin had employed on this occaſion, that even if honour could permit a woman of her character and dignity to entertain a thought of ſecond nuptials, decency at leaſt muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid her to liſten to his addreſſes at a time when the aſhes of her huſband and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor were ſtill warm; and while the ſorrows of her mind were ſtill expreſſed by her mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing garments. She ventured to declare, that ſhe could place very little confidence in the profeſſions of a man, whoſe cruel inconſtancy was capable of repudiating a faithful and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate wife <note n="82" place="bottom">Lactantius de M. P. c. 39.</note>. On this repulſe, the love of Maximin was converted into fury, and as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and judges were always at his diſpoſal, it was eaſy for him to cover his fury with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of legal proceedings, and to aſſault the reputation as well as the happineſs of Valeria. Her eſtates were confiſcated, her eunuchs and domeſtics devoted to the moſt inhuman tortures,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0034700102:257"/>
and ſeveral innocent and reſpectable matrons, who were honoured with her friendſhip, ſuffered death, on a falſe accuſation of adultery. The empreſs herſelf, together with her mother Priſca, was condemned to exile; and as they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniouſly hurried from place to place before they were confined to a ſequeſtered village in the deſerts of Syria, they expoſed their ſhame and diſtreſs to the provinces of the Eaſt, which, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirty years, had reſpected their auguſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Diocletian made ſeveral ineffectual efforts to alleviate the misfortunes of his daughter; and, as the laſt return that he expected for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial purple, which he had conferred upon Maximin, he entreated that Valeria might be permitted to ſhare his retirement of Salona, and to cloſe the eyes of her afflicted father <note n="83" place="bottom">Diocletian at laſt ſent cognatum ſuum, quendam militarem ac potentem virum, to intercede in favour of his daughter (Lactantius de M.

He entreated, but as he could no longer threaten, his prayers were received with coldneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; and the pride of Maximin was gratified, in treating Diocletian as a ſuppliant, and his daughter as a criminal. The death of Maximin ſeemed to aſſure the empreſſes of a favourable alteration in their fortune. The public diſorders relaxed the vigilance of their guard, and they eaſily found means to eſcape from the place of their exile, and to repair, though with ſome precaution, and in diſguiſe, to the court of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius. His behaviour, in the firſt days of his

But theſe grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpects were ſoon ſucceeded by horrour and aſtoniſhment, and the bloody executions which ſtained the palace of Nicomedia, ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her, that the throne of Maximin was filled by a tyrant more inhuman than himſelf. Valeria conſulted her ſafety by a haſty flight, and, ſtill accompanied by her mother Priſca, they wandered above fifteen months <note n="84" place="bottom">Valeria quoque per varias provincias quindecim menſibus ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beio cultû pervagata. Lactantius de M. P. c. 51. There is ſome doubt whether we ſhould compute the fifteen months from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her exile, or from that of her eſcape. The expreſſion of <hi>pervagata</hi> ſeems to denote the latter; but in that caſe we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the treatiſe of Lactantius was written after the firſt civil war between Licinius and Conſtantine.

They were at length diſcovered at Theſſalonica; and as the ſentence of their death was already pronounced, they were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately beheaded, and their bodies thrown into the ſea. The people gazed on the melancholy ſpectacle; but their grief and indignation were ſuppreſſed by the terrors of a military guard. Such was the unworthy fate of the wife and daughter of Diocletian. We lament their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, we cannot diſcover their crimes, and whatever idea we may juſtly entertain of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of Licinius, it remains a matter of ſurpriſe,

It might perhaps have been expected that the conquerors, fatigued with civil war, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected by a private as well as public alliance, would have renounced, or at leaſt would have ſuſpended, any farther deſigns of ambition. And yet a year had ſcarcely elapſed after the death of Maximin, before the victorious emperors turned their arms againſt each other. The genius, the ſucceſs, and the aſpiring temper, of Conſtantine, may ſeem to mark him out as the aggreſſor; but the perfidious character of Licinius juſtifies the moſt unfavourable ſuſpicions, and by the faint light which hiſtory reflects on this tranſaction <note n="86" place="bottom">The curious reader, who conſults the Valeſian Fragment, p. 713, will perhaps accuſe me of giving a bold and licentious para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe; but if he conſiders it with attention, he will acknowledge that my interpretation is probable and conſiſtent.</note>, we may diſcover a conſpiracy fomented by his arts againſt the authority of his colleague. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine had lately given his ſiſter Anaſtaſia in marriage to Baſſianus, a man of a conſiderable family and fortune, and had elevated his new kinſman to the rank of Caeſar. According to the ſyſtem of government inſtituted by Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Italy, and perhaps Africa, were deſigned
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0034700102:260"/>
for his department in the empire. But the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the promiſed favour was either at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſo much delay, or accompanied with ſo many unequal conditions, that the fidelity of Baſſianus was alienated rather than ſecured by the honourable diſtinction which he had obtained. His nomination had been ratified by the conſent of Licinius, and that artful prince, by the means of his emiſſaries, ſoon contrived to enter into a ſecret and dangerous correſpondence with the new Caeſar, to irritate his diſcontents, and to urge him to the raſh enterpriſe of extorting by violence what he might in vain ſolicit from the juſtice of Conſtantine. But the vigilant emperor diſcovered the conſpiracy before it was ripe for execution; and, after ſolemnly renouncing the alliance of Baſſianus, deſpoiled him of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and inflicted the deſerved puniſhment on his treaſon and ingratitude. The haughty refuſal of Licinius, when he was required to deliver up the criminals, who had taken refuge in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, confirmed the ſuſpicions already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of his perfidy; and the indignities offered at Aemona, on the frontiers of Italy, to the ſtatues of Conſtantine, became the ſignal of diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two princes <note n="87" place="bottom">The ſituation of Aemona, or, as it is now called, Laybach, in Carniola (d'Anville Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p. 187.), may ſuggeſt a conjecture.

            <p>The firſt battle was fought near Cibalis, a city of Pannonia, ſituated on the river Save, about <note place="margin">Firſt civil war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</note>

fifty miles above Sirmium <note n="88" place="bottom">Cibalis or Cibalae (whoſe name is ſtill preſerved in the obſcure ruins of Swilei) was ſituated about fifty miles from Sirmium, the capital of Illyricum, and about one hundred from Taurunum, or Belgrade, and the conflux of the Danube and the Save. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man garriſons and cities on thoſe rivers are finely illuſtrated by M. d'Anville, in a memoir inſerted in l'Academie des Inſcriptions, tom. xxviii.</note>. From the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable forces which in this important conteſt two ſuch powerful monarchs brought into the <note place="margin">Battle of Cibalis. A. D. 315. 8th Oct.</note> field, it may be inferred, that the one was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly provoked, and that the other was unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly ſurpriſed. The emperor of the Weſt had only twenty thouſand, and the ſovereign of the Eaſt no more than five and thirty thouſand, men. The inferiority of number was, however, compenſated by the advantage of the ground. Conſtantine had taken poſt in a defile about half a mile in breadth, between a ſteep hill and a deep moraſs, and in that ſituation he ſteadily expected and repulſed the firſt attack of the enemy. He purſued his ſucceſs, and advanced into the plain. But the veteran legions of Illyricum rallied under the ſtandard of a leader who had been trained to arms in the ſchool of Probus and Diocletian. The miſſile weapons on both ſides were ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; the two armies, with equal valour, ruſhed to a cloſer engagement of ſwords and ſpears, and the doubtful conteſt had already laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the dawn of the day to a late hour of the evening, when the right wing, which Conſtantine led in perſon, made a vigorous and deciſive charge. The judicious retreat of Licinius ſaved
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0034700102:262"/>
the remainder of his troops from a total defeat; but when he computed his loſs, which amounted to more than twenty thouſand men, he thought it unſafe to paſs the night in the preſence of an active and victorious enemy. Abandoning his camp and magazines, he marched away with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy and diligence at the head of the greateſt part of his cavalry, and was ſoon removed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the danger of a purſuit. His diligence preſerved his wife, his ſon, and his treaſures, which he had depoſited at Sirmium. Licinius paſſed through that city, and breaking down the bridge on the Save, haſtened to collect a new army in Dacia and Thrace. In his flight he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the precarious title of Caeſar on Valens, his general of the Illyrian frontier <note n="89" place="bottom">Zoſimus (l. ii. p. 90, 91.) gives a very particular account of this battle; but the deſcriptions of Zoſimus are rhetorical rather than military.</note>.</p>
            <p>The plain of Mardia in Thrace was the theatre <note place="margin">Battle of Mardia.</note> of a ſecond battle no leſs obſtinate and bloody than the former. The troops on both ſides diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the ſame valour and diſcipline; and the victory was once more decided by the ſuperior abilities of Conſtantine, who directed a body of five thouſand men to gain an advantageous height, from whence, during the heat of the action, they attacked the rear of the enemy, and made a very conſiderable ſlaughter. The troops of Licinius, however, preſenting a double front, ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their ground, till the approach of night put an end to the combat, and ſecured their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

The Epitomes furniſh ſome circumſtances; but they frequently confound the two wars between Licinius and Conſtantine.</note>. The loſs of two battles, and of his braveſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans, reduced the fierce ſpirit of Licinius to ſue for peace. His ambaſſador Miſtrianus was admitted to the audience of Conſtantine; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiated on the common topics of moderation and humanity, which are ſo familiar to the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the vanquiſhed; repreſented, in the moſt inſinuating language, that the event of the war was ſtill doubtful, whilſt its inevitable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities were alike pernicious to both the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending parties; and declared, that he was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to propoſe a laſting and honourable peace in the name of the <hi>two</hi> emperors his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Conſtantine received the mention of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens with indignation and contempt. <q>It was not for ſuch a purpoſe, he ſternly replied, that we have advanced from the ſhores of the weſtern ocean in an uninterrupted courſe of combats and victories, that, after rejecting an ungrateful kinſman, we ſhould accept for our colleague a contemptible ſlave.

It was neceſſary to accept this humiliating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the unhappy Valens, after a reign of a few days, was deprived of the purple and of his life. As ſoon as this obſtacle was removed, the tranquillity of the Roman world was eaſily reſtored. The ſucceſſive defeats of Licinius had ruined his forces, but they had diſplayed his courage and abilities. His ſituation was almoſt deſperate, but the efforts of deſpair are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times formidable; and the good ſenſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine preferred a great and certain advantage to a third trial of the chance of arms.

The reconciliation of Conſtantine and Licinius, though it was embittered by reſentment and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, by the remembrance of recent injuries, <note place="margin">General peace and laws of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.

As a very regular ſeries of the Imperial laws commences about this period, it would not be difficult to tranſcribe the civil regulations which employed the leiſure of Conſtantine. But the moſt important of his inſtitutions are intimately connected with the new ſyſtem of policy and religion, which was not perfectly eſtabliſhed till the laſt and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful years of his reign. There are many of his laws, which, as far as they concern the rights and property of individuals, and the practice of the bar, are more properly referred to the private than to the public juriſprudence of the empire; and he publiſhed many edicts of ſo local and temporary a nature, that they would ill deſerve the notice of a general hiſtory. Two laws, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, may be ſelected from the crowd; the one, for its importance, the other, for its ſingularity; the former for its remarkable benevolence, the latter for its exceſſive ſeverity. 1. The horrid practice, ſo familiar to the ancients, of expoſing or murdering their new-born infants, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0034700102:266"/>
every day more frequent in the provinces, and eſpecially in Italy. It was the effect of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; and the diſtreſs was principally occaſioned by the intolerable burden of taxes, and by the vexatious as well as cruel proſecutions of the officers of the revenue againſt their inſolent debtors. The leſs opulent or leſs induſtrious part of mankind, inſtead of rejoicing in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of family, deemed it an act of paternal tenderneſs to releaſe their children from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending miſeries of a life which they themſelves were unable to ſupport. The humanity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, moved, perhaps, by ſome recent and extraordinary inſtances of deſpair, engaged him to addreſs an edict to all the cities of Italy, and afterwards of Africa, directing immediate and ſufficient relief to be given to thoſe parents who ſhould produce, before the magiſtrates, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whom their own poverty would not allow them to educate. But the promiſe was too li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, and the proviſion too vague, to effect any general or permanent benefit <note n="93" place="bottom">Codex Theodoſian. l. xi. tit. 27. tom. iv. p. 188. with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defry's obſervations.

The virgin's declaration that ſhe had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with her own conſent, inſtead of ſaving her lover, expoſed her to ſhare his fate. The duty of a public proſecution was intruſted to the parents of the guilty or unfortunate maid; and if the ſentiments of Nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on them to diſſemble the injury, and to repair by a ſubſequent marriage the honour of their family, they were themſelves puniſhed by exile and confiſcation.

Vet. x. The victory of Criſpus over the Alemanni, is expreſſed on ſome medals.</note>. The emperor himſelf had aſſumed the more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and important province of the Danube. The Goths, who in the time of Claudius and Aurelian had felt the weight of the Roman arms, reſpected the power of the empire, even in the midſt of its inteſtine diviſions. But the ſtrength of that warlike nation was now reſtored by a peace of near fifty years; a new generation had ariſen, who no longer remembered the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of ancient days: the Sarmatians of the lake Moeotis followed the Gothic ſtandard either as ſubjects or as allies, and their united force was poured upon the countries of Illyricum. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pona, Margus, and Bononia, appear to have been the ſcenes of ſeveral memorable ſieges and battles <note n="99" place="bottom">See Zoſimus, l. ii. p. 93, 94; though the narrative of that hiſtorian is neither clear nor conſiſtent. The Panegyric of Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus (c. 23.) mentions the alliance of the Sarmatians with the Carpi and Getae, and points out the ſeveral fields of battle. It is ſuppoſed, that the Sarmatian games, celebrated in the month of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, derived their origin from the ſucceſs of this war.</note>; and though Conſtantine encountered a very obſtinate reſiſtance, he prevailed at length in the conteſt, and the Goths were compelled to purchaſe an ignominious retreat, by reſtoring the booty and priſoners which they had taken. Nor was this advantage ſufficient to ſatisfy the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the emperor. He reſolved to chaſtiſe as well as to repulſe the inſolent barbarians who
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0034700102:270"/>
had dared to invade the territories of Rome. At the head of his legions he paſſed the Danube, after repairing the bridge which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Trajan, penetrated into the ſtrongeſt receſſes of Dacia <note n="100" place="bottom">In the Caeſars of Julian (p. 329.

But it is inſinuated by Silenus, that the conqueſts of Conſtantine were like the gardens of Adonis, which fade and wither almoſt the moment they appear.</note>, and when he had inflicted a ſevere revenge, condeſcended to give peace to the ſuppliant Goths, on condition that, as often as they were required, they ſhould ſupply his armies with a body of forty thouſand ſoldiers <note n="101" place="bottom">Jornandes de Rebus Geticis, c. 21. I know not whether we may entirely depend on his authority. Such an alliance has a very recent air, and ſcarcely is ſuited to the maxims of the beginning of the fourth century.</note>. Exploits like theſe were no doubt honourable to Conſtantine, and beneficial to the ſtate; but it may ſurely be queſtioned, whether they can juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the exaggerated aſſertion of Euſebius, that ALL SCYTHIA, as far as the extremity of the North, divided as it was into ſo many names and nations of the moſt various and ſavage manners, had been added by his victorious arms to the Roman empire <note n="102" place="bottom">Euſebius in Vit.

But the old emperor, awakened by the approaching danger, deceived the expectations of his friends as well as of his enemies. Calling forth that ſpirit and thoſe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities by which he had deſerved the friendſhip of Galerius and the Imperial purple, he prepared himſelf for the conteſt, collected the forces of the Eaſt, and ſoon filled the plains of Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople with his troops, and the Streights of the Helleſpont with his fleet. The army conſiſted of one hundred and fifty thouſand foot, and fifteen thouſand horſe; and as the cavalry was drawn, for the moſt part, from Phrygia and Cappadocia, we may conceive a more favourable opinion of the beauty of the horſes, than of the courage and dexterity of their riders. The fleet was compoſed of three hundred and fifty gallies of three ranks of oars. An hundred and thirty of theſe were furniſhed by Egypt, and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent coaſt of Africa. An hundred and ten ſailed from the ports of Phoenicia and the iſle of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus; and the maritime countries of Bithynia, Ionia, and Caria, were likewiſe obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide an hundred and ten gallies. The troops of Conſtantine were ordered to rendezvous at Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica; they amounted to above an hundred

and twenty thouſand horſe and foot <note n="104" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. ii. p. 94, 95.</note>. Their emperor was ſatisfied with their martial appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and his army contained more ſoldiers, though fewer men, than that of his eaſtern com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor. The legions of Conſtantine were levied in the warlike provinces of Europe; action had confirmed their diſcipline, victory had elevated their hopes, and there were among them a great number of veterans, who, after ſeventeen glorious campaigns under the ſame leader, prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to deſerve an honourable diſmiſſion by a laſt effort of their valour <note n="105" place="bottom">Conſtantine was very attentive to the privileges and comforts of his fellow-veterans (Conveterani), as he now began to ſtyle them. See the Theodoſian Code, l. vii. tit. 20. tom. ii. p. 419. 429.</note>. But the naval pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of Conſtantine were in every reſpect much inferior to thoſe of Licinius. The mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time cities of Greece ſent their reſpective quotas of men and ſhips to the celebrated harbour of Piraeus, and their united forces conſiſted of no more than two hundred ſmall veſſels: a very feeble armament, if it is compared with thoſe formidable fleets which were equipped and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the republic of Athens during the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſian war <note n="106" place="bottom">Whilſt the Athenians maintained the empire of the ſea, their fleet conſiſted of three, and afterwards of four, hundred gallies of three ranks of oars, all completely equipped and ready for immediate ſervice. The arſenal in the port of Piraeus had coſt the republic a thouſand talents, about two hundred and ſixteen thouſand pounds. See Thucydides de Bel. Peloponn. l. ii. c. 13. and Meurſius de Fortuna Attica, c. 19.</note>. Since Italy was no longer

the ſeat of government, the naval eſtabliſhments of Miſenum and Ravenna had been gradually neglected; and as the ſhipping and mariners of the empire were ſupported by commerce rather than by war, it was natural that they ſhould the moſt abound in the induſtrious provinces of Egypt and Aſia. It is only ſurpriſing that the eaſtern emperor, who poſſeſſed ſo great a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority at ſea, ſhould have neglected the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of carrying an offenſive war into the centre of his rival's dominions.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of embracing ſuch an active reſolution, <note place="margin">Battle of Hadriano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A. D. 323. July 3.</note> which might have changed the whole face of the war, the prudent Licinius expected the approach of his rival in a camp near Hadrianople, which he had fortified with an anxious care that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his apprehenſion of the event. Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine directed his march from Theſſalonica to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that part of Thrace, till he found himſelf ſtopped by the broad and rapid ſtream of the Hebrus, and diſcovered the numerous army of Licinius, which filled the ſteep aſcent of the hill, from the river to the city of Hadrianople. Many days were ſpent in doubtful and diſtant ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes; but at length the obſtacles of the paſſage and of the attack were removed by the intrepid conduct of Conſtantine. In this place we might relate a wonderful exploit of Conſtantine, which, though it can ſcarcely be paralleled either in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry or romance, is celebrated, not by a venal orator devoted to his fortune, but by an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, the partial enemy of his fame. We are
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0034700102:274"/>
aſſured that the valiant emperor threw himſelf into the river Hebrus, accompanied only by <hi>twelve</hi> horſemen, and that by the effort or terror of his invincible arm, he broke, ſlaughtered, and put to ſlight a hoſt of an hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. The credulity of Zoſimus prevailed ſo ſtrongly over his paſſion, that among the events of the memorable battle of Hadrianople, he ſeems to have ſelected and embelliſhed, not the moſt important, but the moſt marvellous. The valour and danger of Conſtantine are atteſted by a ſlight wound which he received in the thigh, but it may be diſcovered even from an imperfect narration, and perhaps a corrupted text, that the victory was obtained no leſs by the conduct of the general than by the courage of the hero; that a body of five thouſand archers marched round to occupy a thick wood in the rear of the enemy, whoſe attention was diverted by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a bridge, and that Licinius, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed by ſo many artful evolutions, was reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly drawn from his advantageous poſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat on equal ground in the plain. The conteſt was no longer equal. His confuſed multitude of new levies was eaſily vanquiſhed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced veterans of the Weſt. Thirty-four thouſand men are reported to have been ſlain. The fortified camp of Licinius was taken by aſſault the evening of the battle; the greater part of the fugitives, who had retired to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſurrendered themſelves the next day to the diſcretion of the conqueror; and his rival,

who could no longer keep the field, confined himſelf within the walls of Byzantium <note n="107" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. ii. p. 95, 96.

In the late civil wars, the fortifications of that place, ſo juſtly conſidered as the key of Europe and Aſia, had been repaired and ſtrengthened; and as long as Licinius remained maſter of the ſea, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon was much leſs expoſed to the danger of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine than the army of the beſiegers. The naval commanders of Conſtantine were ſummoned to his camp, and received his poſitive orders to force the paſſage of the Helleſpont, as the fleet of Licinius, inſtead of ſeeking and deſtroying their feeble enemy, continued inactive in thoſe narrow ſtreights where its ſuperiority of numbers was of little uſe or advantage.

See Tournefort's Voyage au Levant, Let. xi.</note> ſprang up, which carried the veſſels of Criſpus againſt the enemy, and as the caſual advantage was improved by his ſkilful intrepidity, he ſoon obtained a complete victory. An hundred and thirty veſſels were deſtroyed, five thouſand men were ſlain, and Amandus, the admiral of the Aſiatic fleet, eſcaped with the utmoſt difficulty to the ſhores of Chalcedon. As ſoon as the Helleſpont was open, a plentiful convoy of proviſions flowed into the camp of Conſtantine, who had already advanced the operations of the ſiege. He conſtructed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial mounds of earth of an equal height with the ramparts of Byzantium. The lofty towers which were erected on that foundation, galled the beſieged with large ſtones and darts from the military engines, and the battering rams had ſhaken the walls in ſeveral places. If Licinius perſiſted much longer in the defence, he expoſed himſelf to be involved in the ruin, of the place. Before he was ſurrounded he prudently removed his perſon and treaſures to Chalcedon in Aſia; and as he was always deſirous of aſſociating com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to the hopes and dangers of his fortune, he now beſtowed the title of Caeſar on Martini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,

            <p>Such were ſtill the reſources, and ſuch the <note place="margin">Battle of Chryſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</note> abilities, of Licinius, that, after ſo many ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive defeats, he collected in Bithynia a new army of fifty or ſixty thouſand men, while the activity of Conſtantine was employed in the ſiege of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantium.

A conſiderable part of his victorious army was tranſported over the Boſphorus in ſmall veſſels, and the deciſive engagement was ſought ſoon after their landing on the heights of Chryſopolis, or, as it is now called, of Scutari. The troops of Licinius, though they were lately raiſed, ill armed, and worſe diſciplined, made head againſt their conquerors with fruitleſs but deſperate va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, till a total defeat and the ſlaughter of five and twenty thouſand men irretrievably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the fate of their leader <note n="110" place="bottom">Euſebius (in Vitâ Conſtantin. l. ii. c. 16, 17.) aſcribes this deciſive victory to the pious prayers of the emperor.

He retired to <note place="margin">Submiſſion and death of Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> Nicomedia, rather with the view of gaining ſome time for negotiation, than with the hope of any effectual defence. Conſtantia, his wife and the ſiſter of Conſtantine, interceded with her brother in favour of her huſband, and obtained from his policy rather than from his compaſſion, a ſolemn

promiſe, confirmed by an oath, that after the ſacrifice of Martinianus, and the reſignation of the purple, Licinius himſelf ſhould be permitted to paſs the remainder of his life in peace and affluence. The behaviour of Conſtantia, and her relation to the contending parties, naturally recals the remembrance of that virtuous matron who was the ſiſter of Auguſtus, and the wife of Antony. But the temper of mankind was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and it was no longer eſteemed infamous for a Roman to ſurvive his honour and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. Licinius ſolicited and accepted the pardon of his offences, laid himſelf and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at the feet of his <hi>lord</hi> and <hi>maſter,</hi> was raiſed from the ground with inſulting pity, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſame day to the Imperial banquet, and ſoon afterwards was ſent away to Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, which had been choſen for the place of his confinement <note n="111" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. ii. p. 102.

His confinement was ſoon ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by death, and it is doubtful whether a tumult of the ſoldiers, or a decree of the ſenate, was ſuggeſted as a motive for his execution. According to the rules of tyranny, he was accuſed of forming a conſpiracy, and of holding a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable correſpondence with the barbarians; but as he was never convicted, either by his own conduct or by any legal evidence, we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be allowed, from his weakneſs, to preſume his innocence <note n="112" place="bottom">Contra religionem ſacramenti Theſſalonicae privatus occiſus eſt.

            </head>
            <p>A CANDID but rational inquiry into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, may be conſidered as a very eſſential part of the <note place="margin">Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the inquiry.</note> hiſtory of the Roman empire. While that great body was invaded by open violence, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſlow decay, a pure and humble religion gently inſinuated itſelf into the minds of men, grew up in ſilence and obſcurity, derived new vigour from oppoſition, and finally erected the triumphant banner of the croſs on the ruins of the Capitol. Nor was the influence of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity confined to the period or to the limits of the Roman empire. After a revolution of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fourteen centuries, that religion is ſtill profeſſed by the nations of Europe, the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms. By the induſtry and zeal of the Europeans, it has been widely diffuſed to the moſt diſtant ſhores of Aſia and Africa; and by the means of their colonies has been firmly eſtabliſhed from Canada to Chili, in a world unknown to the ancients.</p>
            <p>But this inquiry, however uſeful or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Its difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> is attended with two peculiar difficulties. The ſcanty and ſuſpicious materials of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0034700102:281"/>
hiſtory ſeldom enable us to diſpel the dark cloud that hangs over the firſt age of the church. The great law of impartiality too often obliges us to reveal the imperfections of the uninſpired teachers and believers of the goſpel; and, to a careleſs obſerver, <hi>their</hi> faults may ſeem to caſt a ſhade on the faith which they profeſſed. But the ſcandal of the pious Chriſtian, and the fallacious triumph of the Infidel, ſhould ceaſe as ſoon as they recollect not only <hi>by whom,</hi> but likewiſe <hi>to whom,</hi> the Divine Revelation was given. The theologian may indulge the pleaſing taſk of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Religion as ſhe deſcended from Heaven, arrayed in her native purity. A more melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly duty is impoſed on the hiſtorian. He muſt diſcover the inevitable mixture of error and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which ſhe contracted in a long reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon earth, among a weak and degenerate race of beings.</p>
            <p>Our curioſity is naturally prompted to inquire <note place="margin">Five cauſes of the growth of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> by what means the Chriſtian faith obtained ſo remarkable a victory over the eſtabliſhed religions of the earth. To this inquiry, an obvious but ſatisfactory anſwer may be returned; that it was owing to the convincing evidence of the doctrine itſelf, and to the ruling providence of its great Author. But as truth and reaſon ſeldom find ſo favourable a reception in the world, and as the wiſdom of Providence frequently condeſcends to uſe the paſſions of the human heart, and the general circumſtances of mankind, as inſtruments to execute its purpoſe; we may ſtill be permitted,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0034700102:282"/>
though with becoming ſubmiſſion, to aſk, not indeed what were the firſt, but what were the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary cauſes of the rapid growth of the Chriſtian church. It will, perhaps, appear, that it was moſt effectually favoured and aſſiſted by the five following cauſes: I. The inflexible, and, if we may uſe the expreſſion, the intolerant zeal of the Chriſtians, derived, it is true, from the Jewiſh religion, but purified from the narrow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocial ſpirit, which, inſtead of inviting, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moſes. II. The doctrine of a future life, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by every additional circumſtance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth. III. The miraculous powers aſcribed to the primitive church. IV. The pure and auſtere morals of the Chriſtians. V. The union and diſcipline of the Chriſtian republic, which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually formed an independent and increaſing ſtate in the heart of the Roman empire.</p>

of the choſen people. But the devout and even ſcrupulous attachment to the Moſaic religion, ſo conſpicuous among the Jews who lived under the ſecond temple, becomes ſtill more ſurpriſing, if it is compared with the ſtubborn incredulity of their forefathers. When the law was given in thunder from Mount Sinai; when the tides of the ocean, and the courſe of the planets were ſuſpended for the convenience of the Iſraelites; and when temporal rewards and puniſhments were the immediate conſequences of their piety or diſobedience, they perpetually relapſed into rebellion againſt the viſible majeſty of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine King, placed the idols of the nations in the ſanctuary of Jehovah, and imitated every fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic ceremony that was practiſed in the tents of the Arabs, or in the cities of Phoenicia <note n="9" place="bottom">For the enumeration of the Syrian and Arabian deities, it may be obſerved, that Milton has compriſed in one hundred and thirty very beautiful lines, the two large and learned ſyntagmas, which Selden had compoſed on that abſtruſe ſubject.</note>.

The divine promiſes were originally made, and the diſtinguiſhing rite of circumciſion was enjoined to a ſingle family. When the poſterity of Abraham had multiplied like the ſands of the ſea, the Deity, from whoſe mouth they received a ſyſtem of laws and ceremonies, declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the proper and as it were the national God of Iſrael; and with the moſt jealous care ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated his favourite people from the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The conqueſt of the land of Canaan was accompanied with ſo many wonderful and with ſo many bloody circumſtances, that the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Jews were left in a ſtate of irreconcilable hoſtility with all their neighbours. They had been commanded to extirpate ſome of the moſt idolatrous tribes, and the execution of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will had ſeldom been retarded by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of humanity. With the other nations they were forbidden to contract any marriages or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, and the prohibition of receiving them into the congregation, which in ſome caſes was perpetual, almoſt always extended to the third,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0034700102:287"/>
to the ſeventh, or even to the tenth generation. The obligation of preaching to the Gentiles the faith of Moſes, had never been inculcated as a precept of the law, nor were the Jews inclined to impoſe it on themſelves as a voluntary duty. In the admiſſion of new citizens, that unſocial people was actuated by the ſelfiſh vanity of the Greeks, rather than by the generous policy of Rome. The deſcendants of Abraham were flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the opinion, that they alone were the heirs of the covenant, and they were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of diminiſhing the value of their inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by ſharing it too eaſily with the ſtrangers of the earth. A larger acquaintance with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, extended their knowledge without correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their prejudices; and whenever the God of Iſrael acquired any new votaries, he was much more indebted to the inconſtant humour of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheiſm than to the active zeal of his own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries <note n="11" place="bottom">All that relates to the Jewiſh proſelytes has been very ably treated by Baſnage, Hiſt. des Juifs, l. vi. c. 6, 7.</note>.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0034700102:289"/>
inculcated in the new as in the ancient ſyſtem: and whatever was now revealed to mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature and deſigns of the Supreme Being, was fitted to increaſe their reverence for that myſterious doctrine. The divine authority of Moſes and the prophets was admitted, and even eſtabliſhed, as the firmeſt baſis of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. From the beginning of the world, an uninterrupted ſeries of predictions had announced and prepared the long expected coming of the Meſſiah, who, in compliance with the groſs apprehenſions of the Jews, had been more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repreſented under the character of a King and Conqueror, than under that of a Prophet, a Martyr, and the Son of God. By his expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifice, the imperfect ſacrifices of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were at once conſummated and aboliſhed. The ceremonial law, which conſiſted only of types and figures, was ſucceeded by a pure and ſpiritual worſhip, equally adapted to all climates, as well as to every condition of mankind; and to the initiation of blood, was ſubſtituted a more harmleſs initiation of water. The promiſe of divine favour, inſtead of being partially confined to the poſterity of Abraham, was univerſally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the freeman and the ſlave, to the Greek and to the barbarian, to the Jew and to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. Every privilege that could raiſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte from earth to Heaven, that could exalt his devotion, ſecure his happineſs, or even gratify that ſecret pride, which, under the ſemblance of devotion, inſinuates itſelf into the human heart,

was ſtill reſerved for the members of the Chriſtian church; but at the ſame time all mankind was permitted, and even ſolicited, to accept the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſtinction, which was not only proffered as a favour, but impoſed as an obligation.

            <p>The enfranchiſement of the church from the <note place="margin">Obſtinacy and reaſons of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews.</note> bonds of the ſynagogue, was a work however of ſome time and of ſome difficulty. The Jewiſh converts, who acknowledged Jeſus in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Meſſiah foretold by their ancient oracles, reſpected him as a prophetic teacher of virtue and religion; but they obſtinately adhered to the ceremonies of their anceſtors, and were deſirous of impoſing them on the Gentiles, who continually augmented the number of believers. Theſe Judaiſing Chriſtians ſeem to have argued with ſome degree of plauſibility from the divine origin of the Moſaic law, and from the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perfections of its great Author. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, <hi>that</hi> if the Being, who is the ſame through all eternity, had deſigned to aboliſh thoſe ſacred rites which had ſerved to diſtinguiſh his choſen people, the repeal of them would have been no leſs clear and ſolemn than their firſt promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>that,</hi> inſtead of thoſe frequent declarations, which either ſuppoſe or aſſert the perpetuity of

The hiſtory of the church of Jeruſalem affords a lively proof of the neceſſity of thoſe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of the deep impreſſion which the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh <note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene church of Jeruſalem.</note> religion had made on the minds of its ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. The firſt fifteen biſhops of Jeruſalem were all circumciſed Jews; and the congregation over which they preſided, united the law of Moſes with the doctrine of Chriſt <note n="17" place="bottom">Paene omnes Chriſtum Deum ſub legis obſervatione credebant. Sulpicius Severus, ii. 31. See Euſebius, Hiſt. Eccleſiaſt. l. iv. c. 5.</note>. It was natural that the primitive tradition of a church which was founded only forty days after the death of Chriſt, and was governed almoſt as many years under the immediate inſpection of his apoſtle, ſhould be received as the ſtandard of orthodoxy <note n="18" place="bottom">Moſheim de Rebus Chriſtianis ante Conſtantinum Magnum, p. 153. In this maſterly performance, which I ſhall often have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to quote, he enters much more fully into the ſtate of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive church, than he has an opportunity of doing in his General Hiſtory.</note>. The diſtant churches very frequently appealed to the authority of their venerable Parent, and relieved her diſtreſſes by a liberal contribution of alms. But when numerous and opulent ſocieties were eſtabliſhed in the great cities of the empire, in Antioch, Alexandria, Epheſus, Corinth, and Rome, the reverence which Jeruſalem had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to all the Chriſtian colonies inſenſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. The Jewiſh converts, or, as they were afterwards called, the Nazarenes, who had laid the foundations of the church, ſoon found themſelves overwhelmed by the increaſing mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, that from all the various religions of polytheiſm inliſted under the banner of Chriſt:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0034700102:293"/>
and the Gentiles, who, with the approbation of their peculiar apoſtle, had rejected the intolerable weight of Moſaic ceremonies, at length refuſed to their more ſcrupulous brethren the ſame tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which at firſt they had humbly ſolicited for their own practice. The ruin of the temple, of the city, and of the public religion of the Jews, was ſeverely felt by the Nazarenes; as in their manners, though not in their faith, they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo intimate a connexion with their impious countrymen, whoſe misfortunes were attributed by the Pagans to the contempt, and more juſtly aſcribed by the Chriſtians to the wrath, of the Supreme Deity. The Nazarenes retired from the ruins of Jeruſalem to the little town of Pella beyond the Jordan, where that ancient church languiſhed above ſixty years in ſolitude and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity <note n="19" place="bottom">Euſebius, l. iii. c. 5.

In the ſame manner, the Roman pontiffs reſided ſeventy years at Avignon; and the patriarchs of Alexandria have long ſince transferred their epiſcopal ſeat to Cairo.</note>. They ſtill enjoyed the comfort of making frequent and devout viſits to the <hi>Holy City,</hi> and the hope of being one day reſtored to thoſe ſeats which both nature and religion taught them to love as well as to revere. But at length, under the reign of Hadrian, the deſperate fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm of the Jews filled up the meaſure of their calamities; and the Romans, exaſperated by their repeated rebellions, exerciſed the rights of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory with unuſual rigour.

The exile of the Jewiſh nation from Jeruſalem is atteſted by Ariſto of Pella (apud Euſeb. l. iv. c. 6.), and is mentioned by ſeveral eccleſiaſtical writers; though ſome of them too haſtily extend this interdiction to the whole country of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine.</note>, to which he gave the privileges of a colony; and denouncing the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt penalties againſt any of the Jewiſh people who ſhould dare to approach its precincts, he fixed a vigilant garriſon of a Roman cohort to enforce the execution of his orders. The Nazarenes had only one way left to eſcape the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and the force of truth was on this occaſion aſſiſted by the influence of temporal advantages. They elected Marcus for their biſhop, a prelate of the race of the Gentiles, and moſt probably a native either of Italy or of ſome of the Latin provinces. At his perſuaſion, the moſt conſiderable part of the congregation renounced the Moſaic law, in the practice of which they had perſevered above a century. By this ſacrifice of their habits and prejudices, they purchaſed a free admiſſion into the colony of Hadrian, and more firmly cemented their union with the Catholic church <note n="21" place="bottom">Euſebius, l. iv. c. 6.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0034700102:295"/>
to accompany their Latin biſhop. They ſtill preſerved their former habitation of Pella, ſpread themſelves into the villages adjacent to Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, and formed an inconſiderable church in the city of Boerea, or, as it is now called, of Alep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po, in Syria <note n="22" place="bottom">Le Clerc. (Hiſt. Eccleſiaſt. p. 477. 535.) ſeems to have collected from Euſebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, and other writers, all the principal circumſtances that relate to the Nazarenes or Ebionites. The nature of their opinions ſoon divided them into a ſtricter and a milder ſect; and there is ſome reaſon to conjecture, that the family of Jeſus Chriſt remained members, at leaſt, of the latter and more moderate party.</note>. The name of Nazarenes was deemed too honourable for thoſe Chriſtian Jews, and they ſoon received from the ſuppoſed poverty of their underſtanding, as well as of their condition, the contemptuous epithet of Ebio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites <note n="23" place="bottom">Some writers have been pleaſed to create an Ebion, the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary author of their ſect and name.

In a few years after the return of the church of Jeruſalem, it became a matter of doubt and controverſy, whether a man who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely acknowledged Jeſus as the Meſſiah, but who ſtill continued to obſerve the law of Moſes, could poſſibly hope for ſalvation. The humane temper of Juſtin Martyr inclined him to anſwer this queſtion in the affirmative; and though he expreſſed himſelf with the moſt guarded diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he ventured to determine in favour of ſuch an imperfect Chriſtian, if he were content to practiſe the Moſaic ceremonies, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

But when Juſtin was preſſed to declare the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of the church, he confeſſed that there were very many among the orthodox Chriſtians, who not only excluded their Judaiſing brethren from the hope of ſalvation, but who declined any intercourſe with them in the common offices of friendſhip, hoſpitality, and ſocial life <note n="24" place="bottom">See the very curious Dialogue of Juſtin Martyr with the Jew Tryphon.

For this date conſult the accurate note of Tillemont, Memoires Eccleſiaſtiques, tom. ii. p. 511.</note>. The more rigorous opinion prevailed, as it was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to expect, over the milder; and an eternal bar of ſeparation was fixed between the diſciples of Moſes and thoſe of Chriſt. The unfortunate Ebionites, rejected from one religion as apoſtates, and from the other as heretics, found themſelves compelled to aſſume a more decided character; and although ſome traces of that obſolete ſect may be diſcovered as late as the fourth century, they inſenſibly melted away either into the church or the ſynagogue <note n="25" place="bottom">Of all the ſyſtems of Chriſtianity, that of Abyſſinia is the only one which ſtill adheres to the Moſaic rites (Geddes's Church Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Aethiopia, and Diſſertations de le Grand ſur la Relation du P.

As the terms of communion were inſenſibly narrowed, and the ſpiritual authority of the prevailing party was exerciſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſeverity, many of its moſt reſpectable adherents, who were called upon to renounce, were provoked to aſſert their private opinions, to purſue the conſequences of their miſtaken principles, and openly to erect the ſtandard of rebellion againſt the unity of the church. The Gnoſtics were diſtinguiſhed as the moſt polite, the moſt learned, and the moſt wealthy of the Chriſtian name, and that general appellation which expreſſed a ſuperiority of knowledge, was either aſſumed by their own pride, or ironically beſtowed by the envy of their adverſaries. They were almoſt without exception of the race of the Gentiles, and their principal founders ſeem to have been natives of Syria or Egypt, where the warmth of the climate diſpoſes both the mind and the body to indolent and contemplative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. The Gnoſtics blended with the faith of Chriſt many ſublime but obſcure tenets, which they derived from oriental philoſophy, and even from the religion of Zoroaſter, concerning the eternity of matter, the exiſtence of two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the myſterious hierarchy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible world <note n="32" place="bottom">In the account of the Gnoſtics of the ſecond and third cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, Moſheim is ingenious and candid; Le Clerc dull, but exact; Beauſobre almoſt always an apologiſt; and it is much to be feared, that the primitive fathers are very frequently calumniators.</note>.

They lurked in the temples, inſtituted feſtivals and ſacrifices, invented fables, pronounced oracles, and were frequently allowed to perform miracles. The Chriſtians, who, by the interpoſition of evil ſpirits, could ſo readily explain every praeternatural appearance, were diſpoſed and even deſirous to admit the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant fictions of the Pagan mythology.

On days of general feſtivity, it was the cuſtom of the ancients to adorn their doors with lamps and with branches of laurel, and to crown their heads with a garland of flowers. This innocent and elegant practice might perhaps have been tolerated as a mere civil inſtitution. But it moſt unluckily happened that the doors were under the protection of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold gods, that the laurel was ſacred to the lover of Daphne, and that garlands of flowers, though frequently worn as a ſymbol either of joy or mourning, had been dedicated in their firſt origin to the ſervice of ſuperſtition. The trembling Chriſtians, who were perſuaded in this inſtance to comply with the faſhion of their country, and the commands of the magiſtrate, laboured under the moſt gloomy apprehenſions, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of their own conſcience, the cenſures of the church, and the denunciations of divine vengeance <note n="50" place="bottom">Tertullian has compoſed a defence, or rather panegyric, of the raſh action of a Chriſtian ſoldier, who, by throwing away his crown of laurel, had expoſed himſelf and his brethren to the moſt imminent danger.

A doctrine thus removed beyond the ſenſes and the experience of mankind, might ſerve to amuſe the leiſure of a philoſophic mind; or, in the ſilence of ſolitude, it might ſometimes impart a ray of comfort to deſponding virtue; but the faint impreſſion which had been received in the ſchools, was ſoon obliterated by the commerce and buſineſs of active life. We are ſufficiently acquainted with the eminent perſons who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the age of Cicero, and of the firſt Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, with their actions, their characters, and their motives, to be aſſured that their conduct in this life was never regulated by any ſerious conviction of the rewards or puniſhments of a future ſtate. At the bar and in the ſenate of Rome the ableſt orators were not apprehenſive of giving offence to their hearers, by expoſing that doctrine as an idle and extravagant opinion, which was rejected with contempt by every man of a liberal education and underſtanding <note n="53" place="bottom">See Cicero pro Cluent. c. 61.

            <p>Since therefore the moſt ſublime efforts of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy <note place="margin">among the Pagans of Greece and Rome;</note> can extend no farther than feebly to point out the deſire, the hope, or, at moſt, the probability, of a future ſtate, there is nothing, except a divine revelation, that can aſcertain the exiſtence, and deſcribe the condition of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible country which is deſtined to receive the ſouls of men after their ſeparation from the body.

But we may perceive ſeveral defects inherent to the popular religions of Greece and Rome, which rendered them very unequal to ſo arduous a taſk. 1. The general ſyſtem of their mythology was unſupported by any ſolid proofs; and the wiſeſt among the Pagans had already diſclaimed its uſurped authority. 2. The deſcription of the infernal regions had been abandoned to the fancy of painters and of poets, who peopled them with ſo many phantoms and monſters, who diſpenſed their rewards and puniſhments with ſo little equity, that a ſolemn truth, the moſt congenial to the human heart, was oppreſſed and diſgraced by the abſurd mixture of the wildeſt fictions <note n="54" place="bottom">The xith book of the Odyſſey gives a very dreary and inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent account of the infernal ſhades. Pindar and Virgil have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed the picture; but even thoſe poets, though more correct than their great model, are guilty of very ſtrange inconſiſtencies. See Bayle, Reſponſes aux Queſtions d'un Provincial, part iii. c. 22.</note>. 3. The doctrine of a future ſtate was ſcarcely conſidered among the devout polytheiſts of Greece and Rome as a fundamental article of faith. The providence of the gods, as it related to public communities rather than to private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, was principally diſplayed on the viſible theatre of the preſent world. The petitions which were offered on the altars of Jupiter or Apollo, expreſſed the anxiety of their worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers for temporal happineſs, and their ignorance or indifference concerning a future life <note n="55" place="bottom">See the xvith epiſtle of the firſt book of Horace, the xiiith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of Juvenal, and the iid Satire of Perſius: theſe popular diſcourſes expreſs the ſentiment and language of the multitude.</note>. The

important truth of the immortality of the ſoul was inculcated with more diligence as well as ſucceſs in India, in Aſſyria, in Egypt, and in Gaul; and ſince we cannot attribute ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <note place="margin">among the barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</note> to the ſuperior knowledge of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, we muſt aſcribe it to the influence of an eſtabliſhed prieſthood, which employed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of virtue as the inſtrument of ambition <note n="56" place="bottom">If we confine ourſelves to the Gauls, we may obſerve, that they intruſted, not only their lives, but even their money, to the ſecurity of another world. Vetus ille mos Gallorum occurrit (ſays Valerius Maximus, l. ii. c. 6. p. 10.), quos memoria proditur eſt, pecunias mutuas, quae his apud inferos redderentur, dare ſolitos. The ſame cuſtom is more darkly inſinuated by Mela, l. iii. c. 2. It is almoſt needleſs to add, that the profits of trade hold a juſt proportion to the credit of the merchant, and that the Druids de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from their holy profeſſion a character of reſponſibility, which could ſcarcely be claimed by any other order of men.</note>.</p>
            <p>We might naturally expect, that a principle ſo <note place="margin">among the Jews;</note> eſſential to religion, would have been revealed in the cleareſt terms to the choſen people of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine, and that it might ſafely have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to the hereditary prieſthood of Aaron.

Dr. Jortin has argued that point in his Remarks on Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, vol. ii. p. 103.</note> The former ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the more opulent and diſtinguiſhed ranks of ſociety, were ſtrictly attached to the literal ſenſe of the Moſaic law, and they piouſly rejected the immortality of the ſoul, as an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that received no countenance from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine book, which they revered as the only rule of their faith. To the authority of ſcripture the Phariſees added that of tradition, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, under the name of traditions, ſeveral ſpeculative tenets from the philoſophy or religion of the eaſtern nations. The doctrines of fate or predeſtination, of angels and ſpirits, and of a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, were in the number of theſe new articles of belief; and as the Phariſees, by the auſterity of their manners, had drawn into their party the body of the Jewiſh people, the immortality of the ſoul became the prevailing ſentiment of the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0034700102:315"/>
under the reign of the Aſmonaean princes and pontiffs. The temper of the Jews was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of contenting itſelf with ſuch a cold and languid aſſent as might ſatisfy the mind of a Polytheiſt; and as ſoon as they admitted the idea of a future ſtate, they embraced it with the zeal which has always formed the characteriſtic of the nation. Their zeal, however, added no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to its evidence, or even probability: and it was ſtill neceſſary, that the doctrine of life and immortality, which had been dictated by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, approved by reaſon, and received by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, ſhould obtain the ſanction of divine truth from the authority and example of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When the promiſe of eternal happineſs was <note place="margin">among the Chriſtians.</note> propoſed to mankind, on condition of adopting the faith, and of obſerving the precepts of the goſpel, it is no wonder that ſo advantageous an offer ſhould have been accepted by great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of every religion, of every rank, and of every province in the Roman empire. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians were animated by a contempt for their preſent exiſtence, and by a juſt confidence of immortality, of which the doubtful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect faith of modern ages cannot give us any adequate notion. In the primitive church, the influence of truth was very powerfully ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened <note place="margin">Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing end of the world.</note> by an opinion, which however it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve reſpect for its uſefulneſs and antiquity, has not been found agreeable to experience. It was univerſally believed, that the end of the world and the kingdom of Heaven, were at hand. The near approach of this wonderful event had been predicted by the apoſtles; the tradition of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0034700102:316"/>
it was preſerved by their earlieſt diſciples, and thoſe who underſtood in their literal ſenſe the diſcourſes of Chriſt himſelf, were obliged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſecond and glorious coming of the Son of Man in the clouds, before that generation was totally extinguiſhed, which had beheld his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition upon earth, and which might ſtill be witneſs of the calamities of the Jews under Veſpaſian or Hadrian. The revolution of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen centuries has inſtructed us not to preſs too cloſely the myſterious language of prophecy and revelation; but as long as, for wiſe purpoſes, this error was permitted to ſubſiſt in the church, it was productive of the moſt ſalutary effects on the faith and practice of Chriſtians, who lived in the awful expectation of that moment when the globe itſelf, and all the various race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſhould tremble at the appearance of their divine judge <note n="60" place="bottom">This expectation was countenanced by the twenty-fourth chapter of St. Matthew, and by the firſt epiſtle of St. Paul to the Theſſalonians. Eraſmus removes the difficulty by the help of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory and metaphor; and the learned Grotius ventures to inſinuate, that, for wiſe purpoſes, the pious deception was permitted to take place.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ancient and popular doctrine of the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium <note place="margin">Doctrine of the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium.</note> was intimately connected with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt. As the works of the creation had been finiſhed in ſix days, their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in their preſent ſtate, according to a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which was attributed to the prophet Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, was fixed to ſix thouſand years <note n="61" place="bottom">See Burnet's Sacred Theory, part iii. c. 5. This tradition may be traced as high as the author of the Epiſtle of Barnabas, who wrote in the firſt century, and who ſeems to have been half a Jew.</note>. By the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0034700102:317"/>
ſame analogy it was inferred, that this long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of labour and contention, which was now almoſt elapſed <note n="62" place="bottom">The primitive church of Antioch computed almoſt 6000 years from the creation of the world to the birth of Chriſt. Africanus, Lactantius, and the Greek church, have reduced that number to 5500, and Euſebius has contented himſelf with 5200 years. Theſe calculations were formed on the Septuagint, which was univerſally received during the ſix firſt centuries. The authority of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and of the Hebrew text has determined the moderns, Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants as well as Catholics, to prefer a period of about 4000 years; though, in the ſtudy of profane antiquity, they often find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtreightened by thoſe narrow limits.</note>, would be ſucceeded by a joyful Sabbath of a thouſand years; and that Chriſt, with the triumphant band of the ſaints and the elect who had eſcaped death, or who had been miraculouſly revived, would reign upon earth till the time appointed for the laſt and general reſurrection. So pleaſing was this hope to the mind of believers, that the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſeat of this bliſsful kingdom, was quickly adorned with all the gayeſt colours of the imagination. A felicity conſiſting only of pure and ſpiritual pleaſure, would have appeared too refined for its inhabitants, who were ſtill ſuppoſed to poſſeſs their human nature and ſenſes. A garden of Eden, with the amuſements of the paſtoral life, was no longer ſuited to the advanced ſtate of ſociety which prevailed under the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. A city was therefore erected of gold and precious ſtones, and a ſupernatural plenty of corn and wine was beſtowed on the adjacent territory; in the free enjoyment of whoſe ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous productions, the happy and benevolent

One of the groſſeſt images may be found in Irenaeus (l. v. p. 455.), the diſciple of Papias, who had ſeen the apoſtle St. John.</note>. The aſſurance of ſuch a Millennium, was carefully inculcated by a ſucceſſion of fathers from Juſtin Martyr <note n="64" place="bottom">See the ſecond dialogue of Juſtin with Tryphon, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth book of Lactantius.

Yet the curious reader may conſult Daillè de Uſu Patrum, l. ii. c. 4.</note> and Irenaeus, who converſed with the immediate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the apoſtles, down to Lactantius, who was preceptor to the ſon of Conſtantine <note n="65" place="bottom">The teſtimony of Juſtin, of his own faith and that of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox brethren, in the doctrine of a Millennium, is delivered in the cleareſt and moſt ſolemn manner (Dialog. cum Tryphonte Jud. p. 177, 178.

Though it might not be univerſally received, it appears to have been the reigning ſentiment of the orthodox believers; and it ſeems ſo well adapted to the deſires and apprehenſions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that it muſt have contributed in a very conſiderable degree to the progreſs of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith. But when the edifice of the church was almoſt completed, the temporary ſupport was laid aſide. The doctrine of Chriſt's reign upon earth, was at firſt treated as a profound allegory, was conſidered by degrees as a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uſeleſs opinion, and was at length reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the abſurd invention of hereſy and fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm <note n="66" place="bottom">Dupin, Bibliothéque Eccleſiaſtique, tom. i. p. 223. tom. ii. p. 366. and Moſheim, p. 720; though the latter of theſe learned divines is not altogether candid on this occaſion.</note>.

A myſterious prophecy, which ſtill forms a part of the ſacred canon, but which was thought to favour the exploded ſentiment, has very narrowly eſcaped the proſcription of the church <note n="67" place="bottom">In the council of Laodicea (about the year 360) the Apocalypſe was tacitly excluded from the ſacred canon, by the ſame churches of Aſia to which it is addreſſed; and we may learn from the complaint of Sulpicius Severus, that their ſentence had been ratified by the greater number of Chriſtians of his time. From what cauſes then is the Apocalypſe at preſent ſo generally received by the Greek, the Roman, and the Proteſtant churches? The following ones may be aſſigned. 1. The Greeks were ſubdued by the authority of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, who, in the ſixth century, aſſumed the character of Dionyſius the Areopagite. 2. A juſt apprehenſion, that the grammarians might become more important than the theologians, engaged the council of Trent to fix the ſeal of their infallibility on all the books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, contained in the Latin Vulgate, in the number of which the Apocalypſe was fortunately included. (Fra Paolo, Iſtoria del Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio Tridentino, l. ii.) 3. The advantage of turning thoſe myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious prophecies againſt the See of Rome, inſpired the proteſtants with uncommon veneration for ſo uſeful an ally.

The edification of the new Jeruſalem was to advance by equal ſteps with the deſtruction of the myſtic Babylon; and as long as the emperors who reigned before Conſtantine perſiſted in the profeſſion of idolatry, the epithet of Babylon was applied to the city and to the empire of Rome.

The Chriſtian, who founded his belief much leſs on the fallacious arguments of reaſon than on the authority of tradition and the interpretation of ſcripture, expected it with terror and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence as a certain and approaching event; and as his mind was perpetually filled with the ſolemn idea, he conſidered every diſaſter that happened to the empire as an infallible ſymptom of an expiring world <note n="69" place="bottom">On this ſubject every reader of taſte will be entertained with the third part of Burnet's Sacred Theory.

The awful ceremony was uſually performed in a public manner, and in the preſence of a great number of ſpectators; the patient was relieved by the power or ſkill of the exorciſt, and the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed daemon was heard to confeſs, that he was one of the fabled gods of antiquity, who had impiouſly uſurped the adoration of mankind <note n="76" place="bottom">Tertullian (Apolog. c. 23.) throws out a bold defiance to the Pagan magiſtrates.

that in the days of Irenaeus, about the end of the ſecond century, the reſurrection of the dead was very far from being eſteemed an uncommon event; that the miracle was frequently perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on neceſſary occaſions, by great faſting and the joint ſupplication of the church of the place, and that the perſons thus reſtored to their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, had lived afterwards among them many years <note n="77" place="bottom">Irenaeus adv.

than that of the preceding generation, till we are inſenſibly led on to accuſe our own inconſiſtency, if in the eighth or in the twelfth century we deny to the venerable Bede, or to the holy Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, the ſame degree of confidence which, in the ſecond century, we had ſo liberally granted to Juſtin or to Irenaeus <note n="81" place="bottom">It may ſeem ſomewhat remarkable, that Bernard of Clairvaux, who records ſo many miracles of his friend St. Malachi, never takes any notice of his own, which, in their turn, however, are carefully related by his companions and diſciples.

If the truth of any of thoſe miracles is appreciated by their apparent uſe and propriety, every age had unbelievers to convince, heretics to confute, and idolatrous nations to convert; and ſufficient motives might always be produced to juſtify the interpoſition of Heaven. And yet ſince every friend to revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perſuaded of the reality, and every reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man is convinced of the ceſſation, of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous powers, it is evident that there muſt have been <hi>ſome period</hi> in which they were either ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly or gradually withdrawn from the Chriſtian church.

Credulity performed the office of faith; fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm was permitted to aſſume the language of inſpiration, and the effects of accident or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance were aſcribed to ſupernatural cauſes. The recent experience of genuine miracles ſhould have inſtructed the Chriſtian world in the ways of Providence, and habituated their eye (if we may uſe a very inadequate expreſſion) to the ſtyle of the divine artiſt. Should the moſt ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful painter of modern Italy preſume to decorate his feeble imitations with the name of Raphael or of Correggio, the inſolent fraud would be ſoon diſcovered and indignantly rejected.</p>
            <p>Whatever opinion may be entertained of the <note place="margin">Uſe of the primitive miracles.</note> miracles of the primitive church ſince the time of the apoſtles, this unreſiſting ſoftneſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſo conſpicuous among the believers of the ſecond and third centuries, proved of ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental benefit to the cauſe of truth and religion. In modern times, a latent and even involuntary ſcepticiſm adheres to the moſt pious diſpoſitions. Their admiſſion of ſupernatural truths is much leſs an active conſent, than a cold and paſſive acquieſcence. Accuſtomed long ſince to obſerve and to reſpect the invariable order of Nature, our reaſon, or at leaſt our imagination, is not ſufficiently prepared to ſuſtain the viſible action of the Deity. But, in the firſt ages of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, the ſituation of mankind was extremely different. The moſt curious, or the moſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, among the Pagans, were often perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter into a ſociety, which aſſerted an actual claim of miraculous powers. The primitive
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0034700102:330"/>
Chriſtians perpetually trod on myſtic ground, and their minds were exerciſed by the habits of believing the moſt extraordinary events. They felt, or they fancied, that on every ſide they were inceſſantly aſſaulted by daemons, comforted by viſions, inſtructed by prophecy, and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly delivered from danger, ſickneſs, and from death itſelf, by the ſupplications of the church. The real or imaginary prodigies, of which they ſo frequently conceived themſelves to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the inſtruments, or the ſpectators, very happily diſpoſed them to adopt with the ſame eaſe, but with far greater juſtice, the authentic wonders of the evangelic hiſtory; and thus mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that exceeded not the meaſure of their own experience, inſpired them with the moſt lively aſſurance of myſteries which were acknowledged to ſurpaſs the limits of their underſtanding. It is this deep impreſſion of ſupernatural truths, which has been ſo much celebrated under the name of faith; a ſtate of mind deſcribed as the ſureſt pledge of the divine favour and of future felicity, and recommended as the firſt or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the only merit of a Chriſtian. According to the more rigid doctors, the moral virtues, which may be equally practiſed by infidels, are deſtitute of any value or efficacy in the work of our juſtification.</p>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0034700102:331"/>
actions of the believer. The firſt apologiſts of Chriſtianity who juſtify the innocence of their brethren, and the writers of a later period who celebrate the ſanctity of their anceſtors, diſplay, in the moſt lively colours, the reformation of manners which was introduced into the world by the preaching of the goſpel. As it is my intention to remark only ſuch human cauſes as were permitted to ſecond the influence of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I ſhall ſlightly mention two motives which might naturally render the lives of the primitive Chriſtians much purer and more auſtere than thoſe of their Pagan contemporaries, or their degenerate ſucceſſors; repentance for their paſt ſins, and the laudable deſire of ſupporting the reputation of the ſociety in which they were engaged.</p>
            <p>It is a very ancient reproach, ſuggeſted by the <note place="margin">Effects of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> ignorance or the malice of infidelity, that the Chriſtians allured into their party the moſt atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious criminals, who, as ſoon as they were touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſenſe of remorſe, were eaſily perſuaded to waſh away, in the water of baptiſm, the guilt of their paſt conduct, for which the temples of the gods refuſed to grant them any expiation. But this reproach, when it is cleared from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation, contributes as much to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as it did to the increaſe of the church <note n="83" place="bottom">The imputations of Celſus and Julian, with the defence of the fathers, are very fairly ſtated by Spanheim, Commentaire ſur les Ceſars de Julian, p. 468.</note>. The friends of Chriſtianity may acknowledge without a bluſh, that many of the moſt eminent
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0034700102:332"/>
ſaints had been before their baptiſm the moſt abandoned ſinners. Thoſe perſons, who in the world had followed, though in an imperfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the dictates of benevolence and propriety, derived ſuch a calm ſatisfaction from the opinion of their own rectitude, as rendered them much leſs ſuſceptible of the ſudden emotions of ſhame, of grief, and of terror, which have given birth to ſo many wonderful converſions. After the example of their Divine Maſter, the miſſionaries of the goſpel diſdained not the ſociety of men, and eſpecially of women, oppreſſed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs, and very often by the effects, of their vices. As they emerged from ſin and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the glorious hope of immortality, they reſolved to devote themſelves to a life, not only of virtue, but of penitence. The deſire of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection became the ruling paſſion of their ſoul; and it is well known, that while reaſon embraces a cold medicrity, our paſſions hurry us, with rapid violence, over the ſpace which lies between the moſt oppoſite extremes.</p>
            <p>When the new converts had been enrolled in <note place="margin">Care of their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> the number of the faithful, and were admitted to the ſacraments of the church, they found themſelves reſtrained from relapſing into their paſt diſorders by another conſideration of a leſs ſpiritual, but of a very innocent and reſpectable nature. Any particular ſociety that has departed from the great body of the nation, or the religion to which it belonged, immediately becomes the object of univerſal as well as invidious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0034700102:333"/>
In proportion to the ſmallneſs of its num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the character of the ſociety may be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the virtue and vices of the perſons who compoſe it; and every member is engaged to watch with the moſt vigilant attention over his own behaviour, and over that of his brethren, ſince, as he muſt expect to incur a part of the common diſgrace, he may hope to enjoy a ſhare of the common reputation. When the Chriſtians of Bithynia were brought before the tribunal of the younger Pliny, they aſſured the proconſul, that, far from being engaged in any unlawful conſpiracy, they were bound by a ſolemn obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to abſtain from the commiſſion of thoſe crimes which diſturb the private or public peace of ſociety, from theft, robbery, adultery, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and fraud <note n="84" place="bottom">Plin. Epiſt. x. 97.</note>. Near a century afterwards, Tertullian, with an honeſt pride, could boaſt, that very few Chriſtians had ſuffered by the hand of the executioner, except on account of their religion <note n="85" place="bottom">Tertullian, Apolog. c. 44. He adds, however, with ſome degree of heſitation, "Aut ſi aliud, jam non Chriſtianus."</note>. Their ſerious and ſequeſtered life, averſe to the gay luxury of the age, inured them to chaſtity, temperance, oeconomy, and all the ſober and domeſtic virtues. As the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were of ſome trade or profeſſion, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on them, by the ſtricteſt integrity and the faireſt dealing, to remove the ſuſpicions which the profane are too apt to conceive againſt the appearances of ſanctity. The contempt of the world exerciſed them in the habits of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0034700102:334"/>
meekneſs, and patience. The more they were perſecuted, the more cloſely they adhered to each other. Their mutual charity and unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting confidence has been remarked by infidels, and was too often abuſed by perfidious friends <note n="86" place="bottom">The philoſopher Peregrinus (of whoſe life and death Lucian has left us ſo entertaining an account) impoſed, for a long time, on the credulous ſimplicity of the Chriſtians of Aſia.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is a very honourable circumſtance for the <note place="margin">Morality of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> morals of the primitive Chriſtians, that even their faults, or rather errors, were derived from an exceſs of virtue. The biſhops and doctors of the church, whoſe evidence atteſts, and whoſe authority might influence, the profeſſions, the principles, and even the practice, of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, had ſtudied the ſcriptures with leſs ſkill than devotion, and they often received, in the moſt literal ſenſe, thoſe rigid precepts of Chriſt and the apoſtles, to which the prudence of ſucceeding commentators has applied a looſer and more figurative mode of interpretation. Ambitious to exalt the perfection of the goſpel above the wiſdom of philoſophy, the zealous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have carried the duties of ſelf-mortification, of purity, and of patience, to a height which it is ſcarcely poſſible to attain, and much leſs to preſerve, in our preſent ſtate of weakneſs and corruption. A doctrine ſo extraordinary and ſo ſublime muſt inevitably command the veneration of the people; but it was ill calculated to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſuffrage of thoſe worldly philoſophers, who, in the conduct of this tranſitory life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult

            <p>There are two very natural propenſities which <note place="margin">Principles of human nature.</note> we may diſtinguiſh in the moſt virtuous and liberal diſpoſitions, the love of pleaſure and the love of action. If the former is refined by art and learning, improved by the charms of ſocial intercourſe, and corrected by a juſt regard to oeconomy, to health, and to reputation, it is productive of the greateſt part of the happineſs of private life. The love of action is a principle of a much ſtronger and more doubtful nature. It often leads to anger, to ambition, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; but when it is guided by the ſenſe of propriety and benevolence, it becomes the parent of every virtue; and if thoſe virtues are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with equal abilities, a family, a ſtate, or an empire, may be indebted for their ſafety and proſperity to the undaunted courage of a ſingle man. To the love of pleaſure we may therefore aſcribe moſt of the agreeable, to the love of action we may attribute moſt of the uſeful and reſpectable, qualifications. The character in which both the one and the other ſhould be united and harmoniſed, would ſeem to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the moſt perfect idea of human nature. The inſenſible and inactive diſpoſition, which ſhould be ſuppoſed alike deſtitute of both, would be rejected, by the common conſent of mankind, as utterly incapable of procuring any happineſs
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0034700102:336"/>
to the individual, or any public benefit to the world. But it was not in <hi>this</hi> world that the primitive Chriſtians were deſirous of making themſelves either agreeable or uſeful.</p>
            <p>The acquiſition of knowledge, the exerciſe of <note place="margin">The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians condemn pleaſure and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury.</note> our reaſon or fancy, and the cheerful flow of unguarded converſation, may employ the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a liberal mind. Such amuſements, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, were rejected with abhorrence, or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the utmoſt caution, by the ſeverity of the fathers, who deſpiſed all knowledge that was not uſeful to ſalvation, and who conſidered all levity of diſcourſe as a criminal abuſe of the gift of ſpeech. In our preſent ſtate of exiſtence, the body is ſo inſeparably connected with the ſoul, that it ſeems to be our intereſt to taſte, with innocence and moderation, the enjoyments of which that faithful companion is ſuſceptible. Very different was the reaſoning of our devout predeceſſors; vainly aſpiring to imitate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of angels, they diſdained, or they affected to diſdain, every earthly and corporeal delight <note n="88" place="bottom">Lactant. Inſtitut. Divin. l. vi. c. 20, 21, 22.</note>. Some of our ſenſes indeed are neceſſary for our preſervation, others for our ſubſiſtence, and others again for our information, and thus far it was impoſſible to reject the uſe of them. The firſt ſenſation of pleaſure was marked as the firſt moment of their abuſe. The unfeeling candidate for Heaven was inſtructed, not only to reſiſt the groſſer allurements of the taſte or ſmell, but even to ſhut his ears againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane

harmony of ſounds, and to view with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference the moſt finiſhed productions of human art. Gay apparel, magnificent houſes, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant furniture, were ſuppoſed to unite the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble guilt of pride and of ſenſuality: a ſimple and mortified appearance was more ſuitable to the Chriſtian who was certain of his ſins and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his ſalvation.

The virtue of the

It was their favourite opinion, that if Adam had preſerved his obedience to the Creator, he would have lived for ever in a ſtate of virgin purity, and that ſome harmleſs mode of vegetation might have peopled paradiſe with a race of innocent and immortal beings <note n="91" place="bottom">Beauſobre, Hiſt.

union of Chriſt with his church, and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to be indiſſoluble either by divorce or by death. The practice of ſecond nuptials was branded with the name of a legal adultery; and the perſons who were guilty of ſo ſcandalous an offence againſt Chriſtian purity, were ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the honours, and even from the alms, of the church <note n="93" place="bottom">See a chain of tradition, from Juſtin Martyr to Jerome, in the Morale des Peres; c. iv. 6—26.</note>.

The primitive Chriſtians were dead to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſures of the world; but their love of action, which could never be entirely extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, ſoon revived, and found a new occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in the government of the church. A ſeparate ſociety, which attacked the eſtabliſhed religion of the empire, was obliged to adopt ſome form of internal policy, and to appoint a ſufficient number of miniſters, intruſted not only with the ſpiritual functions, but even with the temporal direction of the Chriſtian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The ſafety of that ſociety, its honour, its aggrandiſement, were productive, even in the moſt pious minds, of a ſpirit of patriotiſm, ſuch as the firſt of the Romans had felt for the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and ſometimes, of a ſimilar indifference, in the uſe of whatever means might probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to ſo deſirable an end. The ambition of raiſing themſelves or their friends to the honours and offices of the church, was diſguiſed by the laudable intention of devoting to the public benefit, the power and conſideration, which, for that purpoſe only, it became their duty to ſolicit. In the exerciſe of their functions, they were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called upon to detect the errors of hereſy, or the arts of faction, to oppoſe the deſigns of perfidious brethren, to ſtigmatize their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0034700102:344"/>
with deſerved infamy, and to expel them from the boſom of a ſociety, whoſe peace and happineſs they had attempted to diſturb. The eccleſiaſtical governors of the Chriſtians were taught to unite the wiſdom of the ſerpent with the innocence of the dove; but as the former was refined, ſo the latter was inſenſibly corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the habits of government. In the church as well as in the world, the perſons who were placed in any public ſtation rendered themſelves conſiderable by their eloquence and firmneſs, by their knowledge of mankind, and by their dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in buſineſs; and while they concealed from others, and perhaps from themſelves, the ſecret motives of their conduct, they too frequently relapſed into all the turbulent paſſions of active life, which were tinctured with an additional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of bitterneſs and obſtinacy from the infuſion of ſpiritual zeal.</p>
            <p>The government of the church has often been <note place="margin">Its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and equality.</note> the ſubject as well as the prize of religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.

that the apoſtles declined the office of legiſlation, and rather choſe to endure ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſcandals and diviſions, than to exclude the Chriſtians of a future age from the liberty of varying their forms of eccleſiaſtical government according to the changes of times and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The ſcheme of policy, which, under their approbation, was adopted for the uſe of the firſt century, may be diſcovered from the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Jeruſalem, of Epheſus, or of Corinth. The ſocieties which were inſtituted in the cities of the Roman empire, were united only by the ties of faith and charity. Independence and equality formed the baſis of their internal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The want of diſcipline and human learning was ſupplied by the occaſional aſſiſtance of the <hi>prophets</hi>

But theſe extraordinary gifts were frequently abuſed or miſapplied by the prophetic teachers. They diſplayed them at an improper ſeaſon, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly diſturbed the ſervice of the aſſembly, and by their pride or miſtaken zeal they introduced, particularly into the apoſtolic church of Corinth, a long and melancholy train of diſorders <note n="107" place="bottom">See the epiſtles of St. Paul, and of Clemens, to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note>.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0034700102:346"/>
As the inſtitution of prophets became uſeleſs, and even pernicious, their powers were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, and their office aboliſhed. The public functions of religion were ſolely intruſted to the eſtabliſhed miniſters of the church, the <hi>biſhops</hi> and the <hi>preſbyters;</hi> two appellations which, in their firſt origin, appear to have diſtinguiſhed the ſame office and the ſame order of perſons. The name of Preſbyter was expreſſive of their age, or rather of their gravity and wiſdom. The title of Biſhop denoted their inſpection over the faith and manners of the Chriſtians who were committed to their paſtoral care. In proportion to the reſpective numbers of the faithful, a larger or ſmaller number of theſe <hi>epiſcopal preſbyters</hi> guided each infant congregation with equal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and with united counſels <note n="108" place="bottom">Hooker's Eccleſiaſtical Polity, l. vii.</note>.</p>

A regard for the public tranquillity, which would ſo frequently have been interrupted by annual or by occaſional elections, induced the primitive Chriſtians to conſtitute an honourable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual magiſtracy, and to chooſe one of the wiſeſt and moſt holy among their preſbyters to execute, during his life, the duties of their eccleſiaſtical governor. It was under theſe circumſtances that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0034700102:347"/>
the lofty title of Biſhop began to raiſe itſelf above the humble appellation of preſbyter; and while the latter remained the moſt natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction for the members of every Chriſtian ſenate, the former was appropriated to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of its new preſident <note n="109" place="bottom">See Jerome ad Titum, c. 1. and Epiſtol. 85.

Ignatius (ad Smyrnaeos, c. 3, &amp;c.) is fond of exalting the epiſcopal dignity. Le Clerc (Hiſt. Eccleſ. p. 569.) very bluntly cenſures his conduct. Moſheim, with a more critical judgment (p. 161.), ſuſpects the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity even of the ſmaller epiſtles.</note>. It conſiſted in the adminiſtration of the ſacraments and diſcipline of the church, the ſuperintendency of religious ceremonies, which imperceptibly increaſed in number and variety, the conſecration of eccleſiaſtical miniſters, to whom the biſhop aſſigned their reſpective func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the management of the public fund, and the determination of all ſuch differences as the faithful were unwilling to expoſe before the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of an idolatrous judge. Theſe powers, during a ſhort period, were exerciſed according to the advice of the preſbyteral college, and with the conſent and approbation of the aſſembly of Chriſtians. The primitive biſhops were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered only as the firſt of their equals, and the honourable ſervants of a free people. Whenever the epiſcopal chair became vacant by death, a new preſident was choſen among the preſbyters by the ſuffrage of the whole congregation, every

            <p>Such was the mild and equal conſtitution by <note place="margin">Provincial councils.</note> which the Chriſtians were governed more than an hundred years after the death of the apoſtles. Every ſociety formed within itſelf a ſeparate and independent republic: and although the moſt diſtant of theſe little ſtates maintained a mutual as well as friendly intercourſe of letters and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the Chriſtian world was not yet connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any ſupreme authority or legiſlative aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. As the numbers of the faithful were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually multiplied, they diſcovered the advantages that might reſult from a cloſer union of their intereſt and deſigns. Towards the end of the ſecond century, the churches of Greece and Aſia adopted the uſeful inſtitutions of provincial ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and they may juſtly be ſuppoſed to have borrowed the model of a repreſentative council from the celebrated examples of their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Amphictyons, the Achaean league, or the aſſemblies of the Ionian cities. It was ſoon eſtabliſhed as a cuſtom and as a law, that the biſhops of the independent churches ſhould meet in the capital of the province at the ſtated periods of ſpring and autumn. Their deliberations were aſſiſted by the advice of a few diſtinguiſhed preſbyters, and moderated by the preſence of a

liſtening multitude <note n="115" place="bottom">Acta Concil. Carthag. apud Cyprian. Edit. Fell, p. 158.

Their decrees, which were ſtyled Canons, regulated every important controverſy of faith and diſcipline; and it was natural to believe that a liberal effuſion of the holy ſpirit would be poured on the united aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the delegates of the Chriſtian people. The inſtitution of ſynods was ſo well ſuited to private ambition and to public intereſt, that in the ſpace of a few years it was received through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole empire. A regular correſpondence <note place="margin">Union of the church.</note> was eſtabliſhed between the provincial councils, which mutually communicated and approved their reſpective proceedings; and the catholic church ſoon aſſumed the form, and acquired the ſtrength, of a great ſoederative republic <note n="116" place="bottom">Aguntur praeterea per Graecias illas, certis in locis concilia, &amp;c.

            <p>As the legiſlative authority of the particular <note place="margin">Progreſs of epiſcopal authority.</note> churches was inſenſibly ſuperſeded by the uſe of councils, the biſhops obtained by their alliance a much larger ſhare of executive and arbitrary power; and as ſoon as they were connected by a ſenſe of their common intereſt, they were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to attack, with united vigour, the original rights of their clergy and people. The prelates of the third century imperceptibly changed the language of exhortation into that of command, ſcattered the ſeeds of future uſurpations, and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0034700102:351"/>
ſupplied, by ſcripture allegories and declamatory rhetoric, their deficiency of force and of reaſon.

Princes and magiſtrates, it was often repeated, might boaſt an earthly claim to a tranſitory dominion: it was the epiſcopal authority alone which was derived from the deity, and extended itſelf over this and over another world. The biſhops were the vicegerents of Chriſt, the ſucceſſors of the apoſtles, and the myſtic ſubſtitutes of the high prieſt of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic law. Their excluſive privilege of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſacerdotal character, invaded the freedom both of clerical and of popular elections; and if, in the adminiſtration of the church, they ſtill conſulted the judgment of the preſbyters, or the inclination of the people, they moſt carefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated the merit of ſuch a voluntary conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion. The biſhops acknowledged the ſupreme authority which reſided in the aſſembly of their brethren; but in the government of his peculiar dioceſe, each of them exacted from his <hi>flock</hi> the ſame implicit obedience as if that favourite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor had been literally juſt, and as if the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd had been of a more exalted nature than that of his ſheep <note n="118" place="bottom">We may appeal to the whole tenor of Cyprian's conduct, of his doctrine, and of his Epiſtles.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0034700102:352"/>
was not impoſed without ſome efforts on one ſide, and ſome reſiſtance on the other. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical part of the conſtitution was, in many places, very warmly ſupported by the zealous or intereſted oppoſition of the inferior clergy. But their patriotiſm received the ignominious epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets of faction and ſchiſm; and the epiſcopal cauſe was indebted for its rapid progreſs to the labours of many active prelates, who, like Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian of Carthage, could reconcile the arts of the moſt ambitious ſtateſman with the Chriſtian virtues which ſeem adapted to the character of a ſaint and martyr <note n="119" place="bottom">If Novatus, Feliciſſimus, &amp;c. whom the biſhop of Carthage expelled from his church, and from Africa, were not the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable monſters of wickedneſs, the zeal of Cyprian muſt occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have prevailed over his veracity.

with diſtruſt to the ſuſpicions of ſtrangers and enemies: on this occaſion, however, they receive a very ſpecious and probable colour from the two following circumſtances, the only ones that have reached our knowledge, which define any preciſe ſums, or convey any diſtinct idea. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame period, the biſhop of Carthage, from a ſociety leſs opulent than that of Rome, collected an hundred thouſand ſeſterces (above eight hundred and fifty pounds ſterling), on a ſudden call of charity to redeem the brethren of Numidia, who had been carried away captives by the barbarians of the deſert <note n="135" place="bottom">Cyprian.

About an hundred years before the reign of Decius, the Roman church had received, in a ſingle dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſum of two hundred thouſand ſeſterces from a ſtranger of Pontus, who propoſed to fix his reſidence in the capital <note n="136" place="bottom">Tertullian de Preſcriptione, c. 30.</note>.

was the ſociety of Chriſtians either deſirous or capable of acquiring, to any conſiderable degree, the incumbrance of landed property. It had been provided by ſeveral laws, which were enacted with the ſame deſign as our ſtatutes of mortmain, that no real eſtates ſhould be given or bequeathed to any corporate body, without either a ſpecial privilege or a particular diſpenſation from the emperor or from the ſenate <note n="137" place="bottom">Diocletian gave a reſcript, which is only a declaration of the old law; "Collegium, ſi nullo ſpeciali privilegio ſubnixum ſit, haereditatem capere non poſſe, dubium non eſt." Fra-Paolo (c. 4.) thinks that theſe regulations had been much neglected ſince the reign of Valerian.</note>; who were ſeldom diſpoſed to grant them in favour of a ſect, at firſt the object of their contempt, and at laſt of their fears and jealouſy. A tranſaction however is related under the reign of Alexander Severus, which diſcovers that the reſtraint was ſometimes eluded or ſuſpended, and that the Chriſtians were permitted to claim and to poſſeſs lands within the limits of Rome itſelf <note n="138" place="bottom">Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 131. The ground had been public; and was now diſputed between the ſociety of Chriſtians, and that of butchers.</note>. The progreſs of Chriſtianity, and the civil confuſion of the empire, contributed to relax the ſeverity of the laws, and before the cloſe of the third century many conſiderable eſtates were beſtowed on the opulent churches of Rome, Milan, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, Antioch, Alexandria, and the other great cities of Italy and the provinces.</p>
            <p>The biſhop was the natural ſteward of the <note place="margin">Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the revenue.</note> church; the public ſtock was intruſted to his
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0034700102:361"/>
care without account or controul; the preſbyters were confined to their ſpiritual functions, and the more dependent order of deacons was ſolely employed in the management and diſtribution of the eccleſiaſtical revenue <note n="139" place="bottom">Conſtitut. Apoſtol. ii. 35.</note>. If we may give credit to the vehement declamations of Cyprian, there were too many among his African brethren, who, in the execution of their charge, violated every precept, not only of evangelic perfection, but even of moral virtue. By ſome of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful ſtewards the riches of the church were laviſhed in ſenſual pleaſures, by others they were perverted to the purpoſes of private gain, of fraudulent purchaſes, and of rapacious uſury <note n="140" place="bottom">Cyprian de Lapſis, p. 89. Epiſtol. 65. The charge is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the 19th and 20th canon of the council of Illiberis.</note>. But as long as the contributions of the Chriſtian people were free and unconſtrained, the abuſe of their confidence could not be very frequent, and the general uſes to which their liberality was applied, reflected honour on the religious ſociety. A decent portion was reſerved for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the biſhop and his clergy; a ſufficient ſum was allotted for the expences of the public worſhip, of which the feaſts of love, the <hi>agapae,</hi> as they were called, conſtituted a very pleaſing part. The whole remainder was the ſacred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the poor.

Such an inſtitution, which paid leſs regard to the merit than to the diſtreſs of the object, very materially conduced to the progreſs of Chriſtianity.

There is ſome reaſon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to believe, that great numbers of infants, who, according to the inhuman practice of the times, had been expoſed by their parents, were frequently reſcued from death, baptiſed, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and maintained by the piety of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and at the expence of the public trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <note n="144" place="bottom">Such, at leaſt, has been the laudable conduct of more modern miſſionaries, under the ſame circumſtances.

II. It is the undoubted right of every ſociety to exclude from its communion and benefits, ſuch among its members as reject or violate thoſe <note place="margin">Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> regulations which have been eſtabliſhed by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent. In the exerciſe of this power, the cenſures of the Chriſtian church were chiefly directed againſt ſcandalous ſinners, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe who were guilty of murder, of fraud, or of incontinence; againſt the authors, or the followers of any heretical opinions which had been condemned by the judgment of the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal order; and againſt thoſe unhappy perſons, who, whether from choice or from compulſion, had polluted themſelves after their baptiſm by any act of idolatrous worſhip. The conſequences of excommunication were of a temporal as well as a ſpiritual nature. The Chriſtian againſt whom it was pronounced, was deprived of any part in the oblations of the faithful. The ties both of religious and of private friendſhip were diſſolved: he found himſelf a profane object of abhorrence to the perſons whom he the moſt eſteemed, or by whom he had been the moſt tenderly beloved; and as far as an expulſion from a reſpectable ſociety could imprint on his character a mark of diſgrace, he was ſhunned or ſuſpected by the generality of mankind. The ſituation of theſe unfortunate exiles was in itſelf very painful and melancholy; but, as it uſually happens, their apprehenſions far exceeded their
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0034700102:364"/>
ſufferings. The benefits of the Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion were thoſe of eternal life, nor could they eraſe from their minds the awful opinion, that to thoſe eccleſiaſtical governors by whom they were condemned, the Deity had committed the keys of Hell and of Paradiſe. The heretics, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who might be ſupported by the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their intentions, and by the flattering hope that they alone had diſcovered the true path of ſalvation, endeavoured to regain, in their ſeparate aſſemblies, thoſe comforts, temporal as well as ſpiritual, which they no longer derived from the great ſociety of Chriſtians. But almoſt all thoſe who had reluctantly yielded to the power of vice or idolatry, were ſenſible of their fallen condition, and anxiouſly deſirous of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the benefits of the Chriſtian commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>With regard to the treatment of theſe penitents, two oppoſite opinions, the one of juſtice, the other of mercy, divided the primitive church. The more rigid and inflexible caſuiſts refuſed them for ever, and without exception, the meaneſt place in the holy community, which they had diſgraced or deſerted, and leaving them to the remorſe of a guilty conſcience, indulged them only with a faint ray of hope, that the contrition of their life and death might poſſibly be accepted by the Supreme Being <note n="145" place="bottom">The Montaniſts and the Novatians, who adhered to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the greateſt rigour and obſtinacy, found <hi>themſelves</hi> at laſt in the number of excommunicated heretics. See the learned and copious Moſheim, Secul. ii. and iii.</note>. A milder
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0034700102:365"/>
ſentiment was embraced in practice as well as in theory, by the pureſt and moſt reſpectable of the Chriſtian churches <note n="146" place="bottom">Dionyſius ap. Euſeb. iv. 23. Cyprian, de Lapſis.</note>. The gates of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of Heaven were ſeldom ſhut againſt the returning penitent; but a ſevere and ſolemn form of diſcipline was inſtituted, which, while it ſerved to expiate his crime, might powerfully deter the ſpectators from the imitation of his example. Humbled by a public confeſſion, emaciated by <note place="margin">Public pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> faſting, and clothed in ſackcloth, the penitent lay proſtrate at the door of the aſſembly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring with tears the pardon of his offences, and ſoliciting the prayers of the faithful <note n="147" place="bottom">Cave's Primitive Chriſtianity, part iii. c. 5. The admirers of antiquity regret the loſs of this public penance.</note>. If the fault was of a very heinous nature, whole years of penance were eſteemed an inadequate ſatisfaction to the Divine Juſtice; and it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by ſlow and painful gradations that the ſinner, the heretic, or the apoſtate, was re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the boſom of the church. A ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of perpetual excommunication was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, reſerved for ſome crimes of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary magnitude, and particularly for the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable relapſes of thoſe penitents who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready experienced and abuſed the clemency of their eccleſiaſtical ſuperiors. According to the circumſtances or the number of the guilty, the exerciſe of the Chriſtian diſcipline was varied by the diſcretion of the biſhops. The councils of Ancyra and Illiberis were held about the ſame
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0034700102:366"/>
time, the one in Galatia, the other in Spain; but their reſpective canons, which are ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ſeem to breathe a very different ſpirit. The Galatian, who after his baptiſm had repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſacrificed to idols, might obtain his pardon by a penance of ſeven years, and if he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced others to imitate his example, only three years more were added to the term of his exile. But the unhappy Spaniard, who had committed the ſame offence, was deprived of the hope of reconciliation, even in the article of death; and his idolatry was placed at the head of a liſt of ſeventeen other crimes, againſt which a ſentence no leſs terrible was pronounced. Among theſe we may diſtinguiſh the inexpiable guilt of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating a biſhop, a preſbyter, or even a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con <note n="148" place="bottom">See in Dupin, Bibliothèque Eccleſiaſtique, tom. ii. p. 304—313, a ſhort but rational expoſition of the canons of thoſe councils, which were aſſembled in the firſt moments of tranquillity, after the perſecution of Diocletian. This perſecution had been much leſs ſeverely felt in Spain than in Galatia; a difference which may, in ſome meaſure, account for the contraſt of their regulations.</note>.</p>
            <p>The well-tempered mixture of liberality and rigour, the judicious diſpenſation of rewards and <note place="margin">The dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of epiſcopal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> puniſhments, according to the maxims of policy as well as juſtice, conſtituted the <hi>human</hi> ſtrength of the church. The biſhops, whoſe paternal care extended itſelf to the government of both worlds, were ſenſible of the importance of theſe prerogatives, and covering their ambition with the fair pretence of the love of order, they were jealous of any rival in the exerciſe of a diſcipline
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0034700102:367"/>
ſo neceſſary to prevent the deſertion of thoſe troops which had inliſted themſelves under the banner of the croſs, and whoſe numbers every day became more conſiderable. From the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious declamations of Cyprian, we ſhould na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conclude, that the doctrines of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and penance formed the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of religion; and that it was much leſs dangerous for the diſciples of Chriſt to neglect the obſervance of the moral duties, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the cenſures and authority of their biſhops. Sometimes we might imagine that we were liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the voice of Moſes, when he commanded the earth to open, and to ſwallow up, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming flames, the rebellious race which refuſed obedience to the prieſthood of Aaron; and we ſhould ſometimes ſuppoſe that we heard a Roman conſul aſſerting the majeſty of the republic, and declaring his inflexible reſolution to enforce the rigour of the laws. <q>If ſuch irregularities are ſuffered with impunity (it is thus that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Carthage chides the lenity of his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league), if ſuch irregularities are ſuffered, there is an end of EPISCOPAL VIGOUR <note n="149" place="bottom">Cyprian.

If among theſe cauſes we have diſcovered any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial ornaments, any accidental circumſtances, or any mixture of error and paſſion, it cannot appear ſurpriſing that mankind ſhould be the moſt ſenſibly affected by ſuch motives as were ſuited to their imperfect nature. It was by the aid of theſe cauſes, excluſive zeal, the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate expectation of another world, the claim of miracles, the practice of rigid virtue, and the conſtitution of the primitive church, that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity ſpread itſelf with ſo much ſucceſs in the Roman empire. To the firſt of theſe the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were indebted for their invincible valour, which diſdained to capitulate with the enemy whom they were reſolved to vanquiſh. The three ſucceeding cauſes ſupplied their valour with the moſt formidable arms. The laſt of theſe cauſes united their courage, directed their arms, and gave their efforts that irreſiſtible weight, which even a ſmall band of well-trained and intrepid volunteers has ſo often poſſeſſed over an undiſciplined multitude, ignorant of the ſubject, and careleſs of the event of the war. In the various religions of Polytheiſm, ſome <note place="margin">Weakneſs of polythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.</note>

wandering fanatics of Egypt and Syria, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelves to the credulous ſuperſtition of the populace, were perhaps the only order of prieſts <note n="150" place="bottom">The arts, the manners, and the vices of the prieſts of the Syrian goddeſs, are very humourouſly deſcribed by Apuleius, in the eighth book of his Metamorphoſes.</note> that derived their whole ſupport and credit from their ſacerdotal profeſſion, and were very deeply affected by a perſonal concern for the ſafety or proſperity of their tutelar deities. The miniſters of polytheiſm, both in Rome and in the provinces, were, for the moſt part, men of a noble birth, and of an affluent fortune, who received, as an honourable diſtinction, the care of a celebrated temple, or of a public ſacrifice, exhibited, very frequently at their own expence, the ſacred games <note n="151" place="bottom">The office of Aſiarch was of this nature, and it is frequently mentioned in Ariſtides, the Inſcriptions, &amp;c. It was annual and elective. None but the vaineſt citizens could deſire the honour; none but the moſt wealthy could ſupport the expence. See in the Patres Apoſtol. tom. ii. p. 200. with how much indifference Philip the Aſiarch conducted himſelf in the martyrdom of Polycarp. There were likewiſe Bithyniarchs, Lyciarchs, &amp;c.</note>, and with cold indifference performed the ancient rites, according to the laws and faſhion of their country. As they were engaged in the ordinary occupations of life, their zeal and devotion were ſeldom animated by a ſenſe of intereſt, or by the habits of an eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical character. Confined to their reſpective temples and cities, they remained without any connexion of diſcipline or government; and whilſt they acknowledged the ſupreme juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſenate, of the college of pontiffs, and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0034700102:370"/>
of the emperor, thoſe civil magiſtrates contented themſelves with the eaſy taſk of maintaining, in peace and dignity, the general worſhip of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. We have already ſeen how various, how looſe, and how uncertain were the religious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Polytheiſts. They were abandoned, almoſt without controul, to the natural workings of a ſuperſtitious fancy. The accidental circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their life and ſituation determined the object as well as the degree of their devotion; and as long as their adoration was ſucceſſively proſtituted to a thouſand deities, it was ſcarcely poſſible that their hearts could be ſuſceptible of a very ſincere or lively paſſion for any of them.</p>
            <p>When Chriſtianity appeared in the world, even <note place="margin">The ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm of the Pagan world proved fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the new religion,</note> theſe faint and imperfect impreſſions had loſt much of their original power. Human reaſon, which by its unaſſiſted ſtrength is incapable of perceiving the myſteries of faith, had already obtained an eaſy triumph over the folly of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm; and when Tertullian or Lactantius em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their labours in expoſing its falſehood and extravagance, they are obliged to tranſcribe the eloquence of Cicero or the wit of Lucian. The contagion of theſe ſceptical writings had been diffuſed far beyond the number of their readers. The faſhion of incredulity was communicated from the philoſopher to the man of pleaſure or buſineſs, from the noble to the plebeian, and from the maſter to the menial ſlave who waited at his table, and who eagerly liſtened to the freedom of his converſation. On public occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0034700102:371"/>
the philoſophic part of mankind affected to treat with reſpect and decency the religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of their country; but their ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt penetrated through the thin and awkward diſguiſe, and even the people, when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that their deities were rejected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided by thoſe whoſe rank or underſtanding they were accuſtomed to reverence, were filled with doubts and apprehenſions concerning the truth of thoſe doctrines, to which they had yielded the moſt implicit belief. The decline of ancient prejudice expoſed a very numerous portion of human kind to the danger of a painful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs ſituation. A ſtate of ſcepticiſm and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe may amuſe a few inquiſitive minds. But the practice of ſuperſtition is ſo congenial to the multitude, that if they are forcibly awakened, they ſtill regret the loſs of their pleaſing viſion. Their love of the marvellous and ſupernatural, their curioſity with regard to future events, and their ſtrong propenſity to extend their hopes and fears beyond the limits of the viſible world, were the principal cauſes which favoured the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Polytheiſm. So urgent on the vulgar is the neceſſity of believing, that the fall of any ſyſtem of mythology will moſt probably be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the introduction of ſome other mode of ſuperſtition. Some deities of a more recent and faſhionable caſt might ſoon have occupied the deſerted temples of Jupiter and Apollo, if, in the deciſive moment, the wiſdom of Providence had not interpoſed a genuine revelation, fitted to inſpire the moſt rational eſteem and conviction,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0034700102:372"/>
whilſt, at the ſame time, it was adorned with all that could attract the curioſity, the wonder, and the veneration of the people. In their actual diſpoſition, as many were almoſt diſengaged from their artificial prejudices, but equally ſuſceptible and deſirous of a devout attachment; an object much leſs deſerving would have been ſufficient to fill the vacant place in their hearts, and to gratify the uncertain eagerneſs of their paſſions. Thoſe who are inclined to purſue this reflection, inſtead of viewing with aſtoniſhment the rapid progreſs of Chriſtianity, will perhaps be ſurpriſed that its ſucceſs was not ſtill more rapid and ſtill more univerſal.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerved, with truth as well as <note place="margin">as well as the peace and union of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> propriety, that the conqueſts of Rome prepared and facilitated thoſe of Chriſtianity. In the ſecond chapter of this work we have attempted to explain in what manner the moſt civilized provinces of Europe, Aſia, and Africa, were united under the dominion of one ſovereign, and gradually connected by the moſt intimate ties of laws, of manners, and of language. The Jews of Paleſtine, who had fondly expected a temporal deliverer, gave ſo cold a reception to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the divine prophet, that it was found unneceſſary to publiſh, or at leaſt to preſerve, any Hebrew goſpel <note n="152" place="bottom">The modern critics are not diſpoſed to believe what the fathers almoſt unanimouſly aſſert, that St. Matthew compoſed a Hebrew goſpel, of which only the Greek tranſlation is extant.

See Mill. Prolegomena ad Nov. Teſtament. and Dr. Lardner's fair and extenſive collection, vol. xv.</note>. As ſoon as thoſe hiſtories were tranſlated into the Latin tongue, they were perfectly intelligible to all the ſubjects of Rome, excepting only to the peaſants of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria and Egypt, for whoſe benefit particular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were afterwards made. The public high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, which had been conſtructed for the uſe of the legions, opened an eaſy paſſage for the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian miſſionaries from Damaſcus to Corinth, and from Italy to the extremity of Spain or Britain; nor did thoſe ſpiritual conquerors encounter any of the obſtacles which uſually retard or prevent the introduction of a foreign religion into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant country. There is the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe, that before the reigns of Diocletian and Conſtantine, the faith of Chriſt had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every province, and in all the great cities of the empire; but the foundation of the ſeveral <note place="margin">Hiſtorical view of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</note> congregations, the numbers of the faithful who compoſed them, and their proportion to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing multitude, are now buried in obſcurity, or diſguiſed by fiction and declamation. Such imperfect circumſtances, however, as have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our knowledge concerning the increaſe of the Chriſtian name in Aſia and Greece, in Egypt, in Italy, and in the Weſt, we ſhall now proceed to relate, without neglecting the real or imaginary
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0034700102:374"/>
acquiſitions which lay beyond the frontiers of the Roman empire.</p>
            <p>The rich provinces that extend from the <note place="margin">in the Eaſt.</note> Euphrates to the Ionian ſea, were the principal theatre on which the apoſtle of the Gentiles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played his zeal and piety. The ſeeds of the goſpel, which he had ſcattered in a fertile ſoil, were diligently cultivated by his diſciples; and it ſhould ſeem that, during the two firſt centuries, the moſt conſiderable body of Chriſtians was contained within thoſe limits. Among the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties which were inſtituted in Syria, none were more ancient or more illuſtrious than thoſe of Damaſcus, of Berea or Aleppo, and of Antioch. The prophetic introduction of the Apocalypſe has deſcribed and immortaliſed the ſeven churches of Aſia; Epheſus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira <note n="154" place="bottom">The Alogians (Epiphanius de Haereſ. 51.) diſputed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuineneſs of the Apocalypſe, becauſe the church of Thyatira was not yet founded. Epiphanius, who allows the fact, extricates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the difficulty, by ingeniouſly ſuppoſing, that St. John wrote in the ſpirit of prophecy. See Abauzit Diſcours ſur l'Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe.</note>, Sardes, Laodicea, and Philadelphia; and their colonies were ſoon diffuſed over that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous country. In a very early period, the iſlands of Cyprus and Crete, the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia, gave a favourable reception to the new religion; and Chriſtian republics were ſoon founded in the cities of Corinth, of Sparta, and of Athens <note n="155" place="bottom">The epiſtles of Ignatius and Dionyſius (ap.

To theſe domeſtic teſtimonies we may add the confeſſion, the complaints, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Gentiles themſelves. From the writings of Lucian, a philoſopher who had ſtudied mankind, and who deſcribes their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the moſt lively colours, we may learn, that, under the reign of Commodus, his native country of Pontus was filled with Epicureans and <hi>Chriſtians</hi>

See M. de Tillemont, Memoires Eccleſiaſt. tom. iv. p. 675. from Baſil and Gregory of Nyſſa, who were themſelves natives of Cappadocia.</note>. Within fourſcore years after the death of Chriſt <note n="157" place="bottom">According to the ancients, Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered under the conſulſhip of the two Gemini, in the year 29 of our preſent aera.

In his very curious epiſtle to the emperor Trajan, he affirms, that the temples were almoſt deſerted, that the ſacred victims ſcarcely found any purchaſers, and that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition had not only infected the cities, but had even ſpread itſelf into the villages and the open country of Pontus and Bithynia <note n="158" place="bottom">Plin.

who either celebrate or lament the progreſs of Chriſtianity in the Eaſt, it may in general be obſerved, that none of them have left us any grounds from whence a juſt eſtimate might be formed of the real numbers of the faithful in thoſe provinces. One circumſtance, however, has been fortunately preſerved, which ſeems to caſt a more diſtinct light on this obſcure but intereſting ſubject. Under the reign of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius, after Chriſtianity had enjoyed, during more than ſixty years, the ſunſhine of Imperial favour, the ancient and illuſtrious church of Antioch conſiſted of one hundred thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, three thouſand of whom were ſupported out of the public oblations <note n="159" place="bottom">Chryſoſtom. Opera, tom. vii. p. 658. 810.</note>. The ſplendour and dignity of the queen of the Eaſt, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged populouſneſs of Caeſarea, Seleucia, and Alexandria, and the deſtruction of two hundred and fifty thouſand ſouls in the earthquake which afflicted Antioch under the elder Juſtin <note n="160" place="bottom">John Malela, tom. ii. p. 144. He draws the ſame concluſion with regard to the populouſneſs of Antioch.</note>, are ſo many convincing proofs that the whole number of its inhabitants was not leſs than half a million, and that the Chriſtians, however multiplied by zeal and power, did not exceed a fifth part of that great city. How different a proportion muſt we adopt when we compare the perſecuted with the triumphant church, the Weſt with the Eaſt, remote villages with populous towns, and countries recently converted to the faith, with
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0034700102:377"/>
the place where the believers firſt received the appellation of Chriſtians! It muſt not, however, be diſſembled, that, in another paſſage, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom, to whom we are indebted for this uſeful information, computes the multitude of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as even ſuperior to that of the Jews and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans <note n="161" place="bottom">Chryſoſtom. tom. i. p. 592. I am indebted for theſe paſſages, though not for my inference, to the learned Dr. Lardner. Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Goſpel Hiſtory, vol. xii. p. 370.</note>. But the ſolution of this apparent diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is eaſy and obvious. The eloquent preacher draws a parallel between the civil and the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical conſtitution of Antioch; between the liſt of Chriſtians who had acquired Heaven by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the liſt of citizens who had a right to ſhare the public liberality. Slaves, ſtrangers, and infants were compriſed in the former; they were excluded from the latter.</p>
            <p>The extenſive commerce of Alexandria, and <note place="margin">In Egypt.</note> its proximity to Paleſtine, gave an eaſy entrance to the new religion. It was at firſt embraced by great numbers of the Therapeutae, or Eſſenians of the lake Mareotis, a Jewiſh ſect which had abated much of its reverence for the Moſaic ceremonies. The auſtere life of the Eſſenians, their faſts and excommunications, the community of goods, the love of celibacy, their zeal for martyrdom, and the warmth though not the purity of their faith, already offered a very lively image of the primitive diſcipline <note n="162" place="bottom">Baſnage, Hiſtoire des Juifs, l. 2. c. 20, 21, 22, 23. has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, with the moſt critical accuracy, the curious treatiſe of Philo, which deſcribes the Therapeutae. By proving that it was compoſed as early as the time of Auguſtus, Baſnage has demonſtrated, in ſpite of Euſebius (l. ii. c. 17.), and a crowd of modern Catholics, that the Therapeutae were neither Chriſtians nor monks. It ſtill remains probable that they changed their name, preſerved their manners, adopted ſome new articles of faith, and gradually became the fathers of the Egyptian Aſcetics.</note>. It was in

the ſchool of Alexandria that the Chriſtian theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy appears to have aſſumed a regular and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entifical form; and when Hadrian viſited Egypt, he found a church compoſed of Jews and of Greeks, ſufficiently important to attract the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that inquiſitive prince <note n="163" place="bottom">See a letter of Hadrian, in the Auguſtan Hiſtory, p. 245.</note>. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Chriſtianity was for a long time confined within the limits of a ſingle city, which was itſelf a foreign colony, and till the cloſe of the ſecond century the predeceſſors of Demetrius were the only prelates of the Egyptian church. Three biſhops were conſecrated by the hands of Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius, and the number was increaſed to twenty by his ſucceſſor Heraclas <note n="164" place="bottom">For the ſucceſſion of Alexandrian biſhops, conſult Renaudot's Hiſtory, p. 24, &amp;c. This curious fact is preſerved by the patriarch Eutychius (Annal. tom. i. p. 334. Verſ. Pocock), and its internal evidence would alone be a ſufficient anſwer to all the objections which Biſhop Pearſon has urged in the Vindiciae Ignatianae.</note>. The body of the natives, a people diſtinguiſhed by a ſullen inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of temper <note n="165" place="bottom">Ammian.

The Chriſtians of Rome, at the time of the accidental perſecution of Nero, are repreſented by Tacitus as already amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a very great multitude <note n="167" place="bottom">Ingens multitudo is the expreſſion of Tacitus, xv. 44.</note>, and the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of that great hiſtorian is almoſt ſimilar to the ſtyle employed by Livy, when he relates the introduction and the ſuppreſſion of the rites of Bacchus. After the Bacchanals had awakened the ſeverity of the ſenate, it was likewiſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that a very great multitude, as it were <hi>another people,</hi> had been initiated into thoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred myſteries.

that we ſhould interpret the vague expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Tacitus, and in a former inſtance of Pliny, when they exaggerate the crowds of deluded fanatics who had forſaken the eſtabliſhed worſhip of the gods. The church of Rome was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the firſt and moſt populous of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and we are poſſeſſed of an authentic record which atteſts the ſtate of religion in that city about the middle of the third century, and after a piece of thirty-eight years. The clergy, at that time, conſiſted of a biſhop, forty-ſix preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, ſeven deacons, as many ſub-deacons, forty-two acolythes, and fifty readers, exorciſts, and porters. The number of widows, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and of the poor, who were maintained by the oblations of the faithful, amounted to fifteen hundred <note n="169" place="bottom">Euſebius, l. vi. c. 43. The Latin tranſlator (M. de Valois) has though proper to reduce the number of preſbyters to forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four.</note>. From reaſon, as well as from the analogy of Antioch, we may venture to eſtimate the Chriſtians of Rome at about fifty thouſand. The populouſneſs of that great capital cannot perhaps be exactly aſcertained; but the moſt modeſt calculation will not ſurely reduce it lower than a million of inhabitants, of whom the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians might conſtitute at the moſt a twentieth part <note n="170" place="bottom">This proportion of the preſbyters and of the poor, to the reſt of the people, was originally fixed by Burnet (Travels into Italy, p. 168), and is approved by Moyle (vol. ii. p. 151.).

From Gaul, which claimed a juſt pre-eminence of learning and authority over all the countries on this ſide of the Alps, the light of the goſpel was more faintly reflected on the remote provinces of Spain and Britain; and if we may credit the vehement aſſertions of Tertullian, they had already received the firſt rays

the new religion, within a century after the death of its divine author, had already viſited every part of the globe. <q>There exiſts not, ſays Juſtin Martyr, a people, whether Greek or Barbarian, or any other race of men, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever appellation or manners they may be diſtinguiſhed, however ignorant of arts or agriculture, whether they dwell under tents, or wander about in covered waggons, among whom prayers are not offered up in the name of a crucified Jeſus to the Father and Creator of all things <note n="177" place="bottom">Juſtin Martyr, Dialog. cum Tryphon. p. 341.

It will ſtill remain an undoubted fact, that the barbarians of Scythia and Germany, who afterwards ſubverted the Roman monarchy, were involved in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of paganiſm; and that even the converſion of Iberia, of Armenia, or of Aethiopia, was not attempted with any degree of ſucceſs till the ſceptre was in the hands of an orthodox empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <note n="178" place="bottom">See the fourth century of Moſheim's Hiſtory of the Church.

From this impartial though imperfect ſurvey of the progreſs of Chriſtianity, it may perhaps ſeem probable, that the number of its proſelytes <note place="margin">General proportion of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Pagans.</note> has been exceſſively magnified by fear on the one ſide, and by devotion on the other. According to the irreproachable teſtimony of Origen <note n="183" place="bottom">Origen contra Celſum, l. viii. p. 424.</note>, the proportion of the faithful was very inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able when compared with the multitude of an unbelieving world; but, as we are left without any diſtinct information, it is impoſſible to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and it is difficult even to conjecture, the real numbers of the primitive Chriſtians. The moſt favourable calculation, however, that can be deduced from the examples of Antioch and of Rome, will not permit us to imagine that more than a twentieth part of the ſubjects of the empire had enliſted themſelves under the banner of the croſs before the important converſion of Conſtantine. But their habits of faith, of zeal, and of union, ſeemed to multiply their numbers; and the ſame cauſes which contributed to their future increaſe, ſerved to render their actual ſtrength more apparent and more formidable.</p>
            <p>Such is the conſtitution of civil ſociety, that <note place="margin">Whether the firſt Chriſtians were mean and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</note> whilſt a few perſons are diſtinguiſhed by riches, by honours, and by knowledge, the body of the people is condemned to obſcurity, ignorance, and poverty.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0034700102:387"/>
This innocent and natural circumſtance has been improved into a very odious imputation, which ſeems to be leſs ſtrenuouſly denied by the apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts, than it is urged by the adverſaries, of the faith; that the new ſect of Chriſtians was almoſt entirely compoſed of the dregs of the populace, of peaſants and mechanics, of boys and women, of beggars and ſlaves, the laſt of whom might ſometimes introduce the miſſionaries into the rich and noble families to which they belonged. Theſe obſcure teachers (ſuch was the charge of malice and infidelity) are as mute in public as they are loquacious and dogmatical in private. Whilſt they cautiouſly avoid the dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of philoſophers, they mingle with the rude and illiterate crowd, and inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into thoſe minds, whom their age, their ſex, or their education, has the beſt diſpoſed to receive the impreſſion of ſuperſtitious terrors <note n="184" place="bottom">Minucius Foelix, c. 8. with Wowerus's notes.

As the humble faith of Chriſt diffuſed itſelf through the world, it was embraced by ſeveral perſons who derived ſome conſequence from the advantages of nature or fortune.

and of Plato, before he fortunately was accoſted by the old man, or rather the angel, who turned his attention to the ſtudy of the Jewiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <note n="186" place="bottom">The ſtory is prettily told in Juſtin's Dialogues. Tillemont (Mem. Eccleſiaſt. tom. ii. p. 334.), who relates it after him, is ſure that the old man was a diſguiſed angel.</note>. Clemens of Alexandria had acquired much various reading in the Greek, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian in the Latin, language. Julius Africanus and Origen poſſeſſed a very conſiderable ſhare of the learning of their times; and although the ſtyle of Cyprian is very different from that of Lactantius, we might almoſt diſcover that both thoſe writers had been public teachers of rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric. Even the ſtudy of philoſophy was at length introduced among the Chriſtians, but it was not always productive of the moſt ſalutary effects; knowledge was as often the parent of hereſy as of devotion, and the deſcription which was deſigned for the followers of Artemon, may, with equal propriety, be applied to the various ſects that reſiſted the ſucceſſors of the apoſtles. <q>They preſume to alter the holy ſcriptures, to abandon the ancient rule of faith, and to form their opinions according to the ſubtile precepts of logic. The ſcience of the church is neglected for the ſtudy of geometry, and they loſe ſight of Heaven while they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in meaſuring the earth. Euclid is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in their hands. Ariſtotle and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus are the objects of their admiration; and they expreſs an uncommon reverence for the works of Galen. Their errors are derived
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0034700102:389"/>
from the abuſe of the arts and ſciences of the infidels, and they corrupt the ſimplicity of the goſpel by the refinements of human reaſon <note n="187" place="bottom">Euſebius, v. 28.

            <p>Nor can it be affirmed with truth, that the <note place="margin">with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to rank and fortune.</note> advantages of birth and fortune were always ſeparated from the profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Several Roman citizens were brought before the tribunal of Pliny, and he ſoon diſcovered, that a great number of perſons of <hi>every order</hi> of men in Bithynia had deſerted the religion of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors <note n="188" place="bottom">Plin.

His unſuſpected teſtimony may, in this inſtance, obtain more credit than the bold challenge of Tertullian, when he addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the fears as well as to the humanity of the proconſul of Africa, by aſſuring him, that if he perſiſts in his cruel intentions, he muſt decimate Carthage, and that he will find among the guilty many perſons of his own rank, ſenators and matrons of nobleſt extraction, and the friends or relations of his moſt intimate friends <note n="189" place="bottom">Tertullian ad Scapulam.

which in our eyes might have ſeemed the moſt worthy of the heavenly preſent. The names of Seneca, of the elder and the younger Pliny, of Tacitus, of Plutarch, of Galen, of the ſlave Epic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus, and of the emperor Marcus Antoninus, adorn the age in which they flouriſhed, and exalt the dignity of human nature. They filled with glory their reſpective ſtations, either in active or contemplative life; their excellent underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were improved by ſtudy; Philoſophy had purified their minds from the prejudices of the popular ſuperſtition; and their days were ſpent in the purſuit of truth and the practice of virtue. Yet all theſe ſages (it is no leſs an object of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe than of concern) overlooked or rejected the perfection of the Chriſtian ſyſtem.

They intereſt our compaſſion by diſplaying the innocence and ſufferings of their injured brethren. But when they would demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the divine origin of Chriſtianity, they inſiſt much more ſtrongly on the predictions which announced, than on the miracles which accompanied, the appearance of the Meſſiah. Their favourite argument might ſerve to edify a Chriſtian or to convert a Jew, ſince both the one and the other acknowledge the authority of thoſe prophecies, and both are obliged, with devout reverence, to ſearch for their ſenſe and their accompliſhment.

gentle ſway, to inflict a ſevere puniſhment on any part of their ſubjects, who had choſen for themſelves a ſingular but an inoffenſive mode of faith and worſhip.</p>
            <p>The religious policy of the ancient world ſeems to have aſſumed a more ſtern and intolerant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to oppoſe the progreſs of Chriſtianity. About fourſcore years after the death of Chriſt, his innocent diſciples were puniſhed with death by the ſentence of a proconſul of the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and philoſophic character, and according to the laws of an emperor, diſtinguiſhed by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſtice of his general adminiſtration. The apologies which were repeatedly addreſſed to the ſucceſſors of Trajan are filled with the moſt pathetic complaints, that the Chriſtians who obeyed the dictates, and ſolicited the liberty, of conſcience, were alone, among all the ſubjects of the Roman empire, excluded from the common benefits of their auſpicious government. The deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with care; and from the time that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity was inveſted with the ſupreme power, the governors of the church have been no leſs dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently employed in diſplaying the cruelty, than in imitating the conduct, of their Pagan adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. To ſeparate (if it be poſſible) a few authentic as well as intereſting facts from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted maſs of fiction and error, and to relate, in a clear and rational manner, the cauſes, the extent, the duration, and the moſt important circumſtances of the perſecutions to which the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0034700102:398"/>
firſt Chriſtians were expoſed, is the deſign of the preſent Chapter.</p>
            <p>The ſectaries of a perſecuted religion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <note place="margin">Inquiry into their motives.</note> by fear, animated with reſentment, and perhaps heated by enthuſiaſm, are ſeldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to inveſtigate, or candidly to appreciate, the motives of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which often eſcape the impartial and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning view even of thoſe who are placed at a ſecure diſtance from the flames of perſecution. A reaſon has been aſſigned for the conduct of the emperors towards the primitive Chriſtians, which may appear the more ſpecious and probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm. It has already been obſerved, that the religious concord of the world was principally ſupported by the implicit aſſent and reverence which the nations of antiquity expreſſed for their reſpective traditions and ceremonies. It might therefore be expected, that they would unite with indignation againſt any ſect or people which ſhould ſeparate itſelf from the communion of mankind, and claiming the excluſive poſſeſſion of divine knowledge, ſhould diſdain every form of worſhip, except its own, as impious and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous. The rights of toleration were held by mutual indulgence: they were juſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by a refuſal of the accuſtomed tribute. As the payment of this tribute was inflexibly refuſed by the Jews, and by them alone, the conſideration of the treatment which they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0034700102:399"/>
from the Roman magiſtrates, will ſerve to explain how far theſe ſpeculations are juſtified by facts, and will lead us to diſcover the true cauſes of the perſecution of Chriſtianity.</p>

From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews diſcovered a fierce impatience of the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the moſt furious maſſacres and inſurrections. Humanity is ſhocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendſhip with the unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting natives <note n="1" place="bottom">In Cyrene they maſſacred 220,000 Greeks; in Cyprus, 240,000; in Egypt, a very great multitude. Many of theſe unhappy victims were ſawed aſunder, according to a precedent to which David had given the ſanction of his example. The victorious Jews devoured the fleſh, licked up the blood, and twiſted the entrails like a girdle round their bodies. See Dion Caſſius, l. lxviii. p. 1145.</note>; and we are tempted to applaud the ſevere retaliation which was exerciſed by the arms of the legions againſt a race of fanatics, whoſe dire and credulous ſuperſtition ſeemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of

The enthuſiaſm of the Jews was ſupported by the opinion, that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes to an idolatrous maſter; and by the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering promiſe which they derived from their ancient oracles, that a conquering Meſſiah would ſoon ariſe, deſtined to break their fetters, and to inveſt the favourites of heaven with the empire of the earth. It was by announcing himſelf as their long-expected deliverer, and by calling on all the deſcendants of Abraham to aſſert the hope of Iſrael, that the famous Barchochebas collected a formidable army, with which he reſiſted dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two years the power of the emperor Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian <note n="3" place="bottom">For the ſect of the Zealots, ſee Baſnage, Hiſtoire des Juiſs, l. i. c. 17. for the characters of the Meſſiah, according to the Rabbis, l. v. c. 11, 12, 13. for the actions of Barchochebas, l. vii. c. 12.</note>.</p>

By the general indulgence of polytheiſm, and by the mild temper of Antoninus Pius, the Jews were reſtored to their ancient privileges, and once more obtained the permiſſion of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing their children, with the eaſy reſtraint, that they ſhould never confer on any foreign proſelyte

The numerous remains of that people, though they were ſtill excluded from the precincts of Jeruſalem, were permitted to form and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſiderable eſtabliſhments both in Italy and in the provinces, to acquire the freedom of Rome, to enjoy municipal honours, and to obtain at the ſame time an exemption from the burdenſome and expenſive offices of ſociety. The modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or the contempt of the Romans gave a legal ſanction to the form of eccleſiaſtical police which was inſtituted by the vanquiſhed ſect. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, who had fixed his reſidence at Tiberias, was empowered to appoint his ſubordinate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and apoſtles, to exerciſe a domeſtic juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and to receive from his diſperſed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren an annual contribution <note n="5" place="bottom">See Baſnage, Hiſtoire des Juifs, l. iii. c. 2, 3.

Awakened from their dream of prophecy and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0034700102:402"/>
conqueſt, they aſſumed the behaviour of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and induſtrious ſubjects. Their irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable hatred of mankind, inſtead of flaming out in acts of blood and violence, evaporated in leſs dangerous gratifications.

For theſe, or for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of equal weight, the name of Edom was applied by the Jews to the Roman empire.</note>.</p>
            <p>Since the Jews, who rejected with abhorrence <note place="margin">The Jews were a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which followed, the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians a ſect which deſerted, the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their fathers.</note> the deities adored by their ſovereign and by their fellow-ſubjects, enjoyed however the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their unſocial religion; there muſt have exiſted ſome other cauſe, which expoſed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt to thoſe ſeverities from which the poſterity of Abraham was exempt. The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between them is ſimple and obvious; but, according to the ſentiments of antiquity, it was of the higheſt importance. The Jews were a <hi>nation;</hi> the Chriſtians were a <hi>ſect:</hi> and if it was natural for every community to reſpect the ſacred inſtitutions of their neighbours, it was incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on them to perſevere in thoſe of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. The voice of oracles, the precepts of philoſophers, and the authority of the laws, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly enforced this national obligation. By their lofty claim of ſuperior ſanctity, the Jews
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0034700102:403"/>
might provoke the Polytheiſts to conſider them as an odious and impure race. By diſdaining the intercourſe of other nations they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their contempt. The laws of Moſes might be for the moſt part frivolous or abſurd; yet ſince they had been received during many ages by a large ſociety, his followers were juſtified by the example of mankind; and it was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged, that they had a right to practiſe what it would have been criminal in them to neglect. But this principle which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the Jewiſh ſynagogue, afforded not any favour or ſecurity to the primitive church. By embracing the faith of the Goſpel, the Chriſtians incurred the ſuppoſed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable offence. They diſſolved the ſacred ties of cuſtom and education, violated the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtitutions of their country, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly deſpiſed whatever their fathers had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as true, or had reverenced as ſacred. Nor was this apoſtacy (if we may uſe the expreſſion) merely of a partial or local kind; ſince the pious deſerter who withdrew himſelf from the temples of Egypt or Syria, would equally diſdain to ſeek an aſylum in thoſe of Athens or Carthage. Every Chriſtian rejected with contempt the ſuperſtitions of his family, his city, and his province. The whole body of Chriſtians unanimouſly refuſed to hold any communion with the gods of Rome, of the empire, and of mankind. It was in vain that the oppreſſed believer aſſerted the inalienable rights of conſcience and private judgment. Though his ſituation might excite the pity, his
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0034700102:404"/>
arguments could never reach the underſtanding, either of the philoſophic or of the believing part of the Pagan world. To their apprehenſions, it was no leſs a matter of ſurpriſe, that any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals ſhould entertain ſcruples againſt comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the eſtabliſhed mode of worſhip, than if they had conceived a ſudden abhorrence to the manners, the dreſs, or the language of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country <note n="8" place="bottom">From the arguments of Celſus, as they are repreſented and refuted by Origen (l. v. p. 247-259.), we may clearly diſcover the diſtinction that was made between the Jewiſh <hi>people</hi> and the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian <hi>ſect.</hi> See in the Dialogue of Minucius Foelix (c. 5, 6.) a fair and not inelegant deſcription of the popular ſentiments, with regard to the deſertion of the eſtabliſhed worſhip.</note>.</p>

Malice and prejudice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in repreſenting the Chriſtians as a ſociety of atheiſts, who, by the moſt daring attack on the religious conſtitution of the empire, had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the ſevereſt animadverſion of the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. They had ſeparated themſelves (they gloried in the confeſſion) from every mode of ſuperſtition which was received in any part of the globe by the various temper of polytheiſm: but it was not altogether ſo evident what deity, or what form of worſhip, they had ſubſtituted to the gods and temples of antiquity. The pure and ſublime idea which they entertained of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being eſcaped the groſs conception of the Pagan multitude, who were at a loſs to diſcover
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0034700102:405"/>
a ſpiritual and ſolitary God, that was neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under any corporeal figure or viſible ſymbol, nor was adored with the accuſtomed pomp of libations and feſtivals, of altars and ſacrifices <note n="9" place="bottom">Cur nullas aras habent? templa nulla? nulla nota ſimulacra?—Unde autem, vel quis ille, aut ubi, Deus unicus, ſolitarius, deſtitutus?

The ſages of Greece and Rome, who had elevated their minds to the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the exiſtence and attributes of the Firſt Cauſe, were induced by reaſon or by vanity to reſerve for themſelves and their choſen diſciples the privilege of this philoſophical devotion <note n="10" place="bottom">It is difficult (ſays Plato) to attain, and dangerous to publiſh, the knowledge of the true God.

They were far from admitting the prejudices of mankind as the ſtandard of truth, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered them as flowing from the original diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of human nature; and they ſuppoſed that any popular mode of faith and worſhip which preſumed to diſclaim the aſſiſtance of the ſenſes, would, in proportion as it receded from ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, find itſelf incapable of reſtraining the wanderings of the fancy and the viſions of fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm.

            <p>It might appear leſs ſurpriſing, that the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſtianity ſhould not only be revered by his diſciples as a ſage and a prophet, but that he ſhould be adored as a God. The Polytheiſts were diſpoſed to adopt every article of faith, which ſeemed to offer any reſemblance, however diſtant or imperfect, with the popular mythology; and the legends of Bacchus, of Hercules, and of Aeſculapius, had, in ſome meaſure, prepared their imagination for the appearance of the Son of God under a human form <note n="12" place="bottom">According to Juſtin Martyr (Apolog. Major, c. 70-85), the daemon, who had gained ſome imperfect knowledge of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, purpoſely contrived this reſemblance, which might deter, though by different means, both the people and the philoſophers from embracing the ſaith of Chriſt.</note>. But they were aſtoniſhed that the Chriſtians ſhould abandon the temples of thoſe ancient heroes, who, in the

The Pagan multitude, reſerving their gratitude for temporal benefits alone, rejected the ineſtimable preſent of life and immortality, which was offered to mankind by Jeſus of Nazareth. His mild conſtancy in the midſt of cruel and voluntary ſufferings, his univerſal benevolence, and the ſublime ſimplicity of his actions and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, were inſufficient, in the opinion of thoſe carnal men, to compenſate for the want of fame, of empire, and of ſucceſs; and whilſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to acknowledge his ſtupendous triumph over the powers of darkneſs and of the grave, they miſrepreſented, or they inſulted, the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal birth, wandering life, and ignominious death, of the divine Author of Chriſtianity <note n="13" place="bottom">In the firſt and ſecond books of Origen, Celſus treats the birth and character of our Saviour with the moſt impious contempt.

the utmoſt jealouſy and diſtruſt any aſſociation among its ſubjects; and that the privileges of private corporations, though formed for the moſt harmleſs or beneficial purpoſes, were beſtowed with a very ſparing hand <note n="14" place="bottom">The emperor Trajan refuſed to incorporate a company of 150 fire-men, for the uſe of the city of Nicomedia.

The pious diſobedience of the Chriſtians made their conduct, or perhaps their deſigns, appear in a much more ſerious and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal light; and the Roman princes, who might perhaps have ſuffered themſelves to be diſarmed by a ready ſubmiſſion, deeming their honour concerned in the execution of their commands, ſometimes attempted, by rigorous puniſhments, to ſubdue this independent ſpirit, which boldly acknowledged an authority ſuperior to that of the magiſtrate. The extent and duration of this ſpiritual conſpiracy ſeemed to render it every day more deſerving of his animadverſion. We have already ſeen that the active and ſucceſsful zeal of

to the primitive church, is by no means ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal as that of modern ſovereigns, who have employed the arm of violence and terror againſt the religious opinions of any part of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. From their reflections, or even from their own feelings, a Charles V. or a Louis XIV. might have acquired a juſt knowledge of the rights of conſcience, of the obligation of faith, and of the innocence of error. But the princes and magiſtrates of ancient Rome were ſtrangers to thoſe principles which inſpired and authoriſed the inflexible obſtinacy of the Chriſtians in the cauſe of truth, nor could they themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in their own breaſts, any motive which would have prompted them to refuſe a legal, and as it were a natural, ſubmiſſion to the ſacred inſtitutions of their country.

From the general view of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and motives we might naturally conclude: I. That a conſiderable time elapſed before they conſidered the new ſectaries as an object deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the attention of government. II. That in the conviction of any of their ſubjects who were accuſed of ſo very ſingular a crime, they
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0034700102:415"/>
proceeded with caution and reluctance. III. That they were moderate in the uſe of puniſhments; and IV. That the afflicted church enjoyed many intervals of peace and tranquillity.

The ſlow and gradual abolition of the Moſaic ceremonies afforded a ſafe and innocent diſguiſe to the more early proſelytes of the Goſpel. As they were far the greater part of the race of Abraham, they were diſtinguiſhed by the peculiar mark of circumciſion, offered up their devotions in the Temple of Jeruſalem till its final deſtruction, and received both the Law and the Prophets as the genuine inſpirations of the Deity. The Gentile converts, who by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual adoption had been aſſociated to the hope of Iſrael, were likewiſe confounded under the

It was not long, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, before the Jews themſelves, animated with a fiercer zeal and a more jealous faith, perceived the gradual ſeparation of their Nazarene bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren from the doctrine of the ſynagogue; and they would gladly have extinguiſhed the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous hereſy in the blood of its adherents. But the decrees of heaven had already diſarmed their malice; and though they might ſometimes exert the licentious privilege of ſedition, they no longer poſſeſſed the adminiſtration of criminal juſtice; nor did they find it eaſy to infuſe into the calm breaſt of a Roman magiſtrate the rancour of their own zeal and prejudice. The provincial governors declared themſelves ready to liſten to any accuſation that might affect the public ſafety: but as ſoon as they were informed, that it was a queſtion not of facts but of words, a diſpute relating only to the interpretation of the Jewiſh laws and prophecies, they deemed it unworthy of the majeſty of Rome ſeriouſly to diſcuſs the obſcure differences which might ariſe among a
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0034700102:417"/>
barbarous and ſuperſtitious people. The inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the firſt Chriſtians was protected by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and contempt; and the tribunal of the pagan magiſtrate often proved their moſt aſſured refuge againſt the fury of the ſynagogue <note n="26" place="bottom">See in the xviiith and xxvth chapters of the Acts of the Apoſtles, the behaviour of Gallio, proconſul of Achaia, and of Feſtus, procurator of Judea.</note>. If indeed we were diſpoſed to adopt the traditions of a too credulous antiquity, we might relate the diſtant peregrinations, the wonderful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, and the various deaths of the twelve apoſtles: but a more accurate inquiry will induce us to doubt, whether any of thoſe perſons who had been witneſſes to the miracles of Chriſt were permitted beyond the limits of Paleſtine, to ſeal with their blood the truth of their teſtimony <note n="27" place="bottom">In the time of Tertullian and Clemens of Alexandria, the glory of martyrdom was confined to St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. James. It was gradually beſtowed on the reſt of the apoſtles, by the more recent Greeks, who prudently ſelected for the theatre of their preaching and ſufferings, ſome remote country beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Roman empire. See Moſheim, p. 81. and Tillemont, Memoires Eccleſiaſtiques, tom. i. part iii.</note>. From the ordinary term of human life, it may very naturally be preſumed that moſt of them were deceaſed before the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of the Jews broke out into that furious war, which was terminated only by the ruin of Jeruſalem. During a long period, from the death of Chriſt to that memorable rebellion, we cannot diſcover any traces of Roman intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, unleſs they are to be found in the ſudden, the tranſient, but the cruel perſecution, which
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0034700102:418"/>
was exerciſed by Nero againſt the Chriſtians of the capital, thirty-five years after the former, and only two years before the latter of thoſe great events. The character of the philoſophic hiſtorian, to whom we are principally indebted for the knowledge of this ſingular tranſaction, would alone be ſufficient to recommend it to our moſt attentive conſideration.</p>
            <p>In the tenth year of the reign of Nero, the <note place="margin">The fire of Rome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reign of Nero.</note> capital of the empire was afflicted by a fire which raged beyond the memory or example of former ages <note n="28" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. xv. 38—44. Sueton. in Neron. c. 38. Dion Caſſius, l. lxii. p. 1014. Oroſius, vii. 7.</note>. The monuments of Grecian art and of Roman virtue, the trophies of the Punic and Gallic wars, the moſt holy temples, and the moſt ſplendid palaces, were involved in one common deſtruction. Of the fourteen regions or quarters into which Rome was divided, four only ſubſiſted entire, three were levelled with the ground, and the remaining ſeven, which had experienced the fury of the flames, diſplayed a melancholy proſpect of ruin and deſolation. The vigilance of government appears not to have neglected any of the precautions which might alleviate the ſenſe of ſo dreadful a calamity. The Imperial gardens were thrown open to the diſtreſſed multitude, temporary buildings were erected for their accommodation, and a plentiful ſupply of corn and proviſions was diſtributed at
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0034700102:419"/>
a very moderate price <note n="29" place="bottom">The price of wheat (probably of the <hi>modius)</hi> was reduced as low as <hi>terni Nummi;</hi> which would be equivalent to about fifteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the Engliſh quarter.</note>. The moſt generous policy ſeemed to have dictated the edicts which regulated the diſpoſition of the ſtreets and the conſtruction of private houſes; and as it uſually happens, in an age of proſperity, the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rome, in the courſe of a few years, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a new city, more regular and more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than the former. But all the prudence and humanity affected by Nero on this occaſion were inſufficient to preſerve him from the popular ſuſpicion. Every crime might be imputed to the aſſaſſin of his wife and mother; nor could the prince, who proſtituted his perſon and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity on the theatre, be deemed incapable of the moſt extravagant folly. The voice of rumour accuſed the emperor as the incendiary of his own capital; and as the moſt incredible ſtories are the beſt adapted to the genius of an enraged people, it was gravely reported, and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that Nero, enjoying the calamity which he had occaſioned, amuſed himſelf with ſinging to his lyre the deſtruction of ancient Troy <note n="30" place="bottom">We may obſerve, that the rumour is mentioned by Tacitus with a very becoming diſtruſt and heſitation, whilſt it is greedily tranſcribed by Suetonius, and ſolemnly confirmed by Dion.</note>. To divert a ſuſpicion, which the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotiſm was unable to ſuppreſs, the emperor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſubſtitute in his own place ſome ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious criminals. <q>With this view (continues

Tacitus) he inflicted the moſt exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on thoſe men, who, under the vulgar appellation of Chriſtians, were already branded <note place="margin">Cruel pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Chriſtians, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries of the city.</note> with deſerved infamy. They derived their name and origin from Chriſt, who in the reign of Tiberius had ſuffered death, by the ſentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate <note n="31" place="bottom">This teſtimony is alone ſufficient to expoſe the anachroniſm of the Jews, who place the birth of Chriſt near a century ſooner (Baſnage, Hiſtoire des Juifs, l. v. c. 14, 15.). We may learn from Joſephus (Antiquitat. xviii. 3.), that the procuratorſhip of Pilate correſponded with the laſt ten years of Tiberius, A. D. 27—37. As to the particular time of the death of Chriſt, a very early tradition fixed it to the 25th of March, A. D. 29, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip of the two Gemini (Tertullian adv. Judaeos, c. 8.). This date, which is adopted by Pagi, cardinal Norris, and Le Clerc, ſeems, at leaſt, as probable as the vulgar aera, which is placed (I know not from what conjectures) four years later.</note>. For a while, this dire ſuperſtition was checked; but it again burſt forth; and not only ſpread itſelf over Judaea, the firſt ſeat of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous ſect, but was even introduced into Rome, the common aſylum which receives and protects, whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious. The confeſſions of thoſe who were ſeized, diſcovered a great multitude of their accomplices, and they were all convicted, not ſo much for the crime of ſetting fire to the city, as for their hatred of human kind <note n="32" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Odio humani generis convicti.</hi> Theſe words may either ſignify the hatred of mankind towards the Chriſtians, or the hatred of the Chriſtians towards mankind. I have preferred the latter ſenſe, as the moſt agreeable to the ſtyle of Tacitus, and to the popular error, of which a precept of the Goſpel (See Luke xiv. 26.) had been, perhaps, the innocent occaſion. My interpretation is juſtified by the authority of Lipſius; of the Italian, the French, and the Engliſh tranſlators of Tacitus; of Moſheim (p. 102.), of Le Clerc (Hiſtoria Eccleſiaſt. p. 427.), of Dr. Lardner (Teſtimonies, vol. i. p. 345.), and of the biſhop of Glouceſter (Divine Legation, vol. iii. p. 38.).

They died in torments, and their torments were embittered by inſult and deriſion. Some were nailed on croſſes; others ſewn up in the ſkins of wild beaſts, and expoſed to the fury of dogs: others again, ſmeared over with combuſtible materials, were uſed as torches to illuminate the darkneſs of the night. The gardens of Nero were deſtined for the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſpectacle, which was accompanied with a horſe race, and honoured with the preſence of the emperor, who mingled with the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in the dreſs and attitude of a charioteer. The guilt of the Chriſtians deſerved indeed the moſt exemplary puniſhment, but the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic abhorrence was changed into commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the opinion that thoſe unhappy wretches were ſacrificed, not ſo much to the public welfare, as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant <note n="33" place="bottom">Tacit.

To collect, to diſpoſe, and to adorn a ſeries of fourſcore years, in an immortal work, every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of which is pregnant with the deepeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and the moſt lively images, was an undertaking ſufficient to exerciſe the genius of Tacitus himſelf during the greateſt part of his life. In the laſt years of the reign of Trajan, whilſt the victorious monarch extended the power of Rome beyond its ancient limits, the hiſtorian was deſcribing, in the ſecond and fourth books of his annals, the tyranny of Tiberius <note n="39" place="bottom">See Tacit. Annal. ii. 61. iv. 4.</note>; and the emperor Hadrian muſt have ſucceeded to the throne, before Tacitus, in the regular proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his work, could relate the fire of the capital and the cruelty of Nero towards the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Chriſtians. At the diſtance of ſixty years, it was the duty of the annaliſt to adopt
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0034700102:425"/>
the narratives of contemporaries; but it was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for the philoſopher to indulge himſelf in the deſcription of the origin, the progreſs, and the character of the new ſect, not ſo much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the knowledge or prejudices of the age of Nero, as according to thoſe of the time of Hadrian. 3. Tacitus very frequently truſts to the curioſity or reflection of his readers to ſupply thoſe intermediate circumſtances and ideas, which, in his extreme conciſeneſs, he has thought proper to ſuppreſs. We may therefore preſume to imagine ſome probable cauſe which could direct the cruelty of Nero againſt the Chriſtians of Rome, whoſe obſcurity, as well as innocence, ſhould have ſhielded them from his indignation, and even from his notice. The Jews, who were numerous in the capital, and oppreſſed in their own country, were a much fitter object for the ſuſpicions of the emperor and of the people; nor did it ſeem unlikely that a vanquiſhed nation, who already diſcovered their abhorrence of the Roman yoke, might have recourſe to the moſt atrocious means of gratifying their implacable revenge. But the Jews poſſeſſed very powerful advocates in the palace, and even in the heart of the tyrant; his wife and miſtreſs, the beautiful Poppaea, and a favourite player of the race of Abraham, who had already employed their interceſſion in behalf of the obnoxious people <note n="40" place="bottom">The player's name was Aliturus. Through the ſame channel, Joſephus (de Vitâ ſuâ, c. 3.), about two years before, had obtained the pardon and releaſe of ſome Jewiſh prieſts who were priſoners at Rome.</note>. In their room it.

was neceſſary to offer ſome other victims, and it might eaſily be ſuggeſted that, although the genuine followers of Moſes were innocent of the fire of Rome, there had ariſen among them a new and pernicious ſect of GALILAEANS, which was capable of the moſt horrid crimes. Under the appellation of GALILAEANS, two diſtinctions of men were confounded, the moſt oppoſite to each other in their manners and principles; the diſciples who had embraced the faith of Jeſus of Nazareth <note n="41" place="bottom">The learned Dr. Lardner (Jewiſh and Heathen Teſtimonies, vol. ii. p. 102, 103.) has proved that the name of Galilaeans, was a very ancient, and perhaps the primitive, appellation of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</note>, and the zealots who had followed the ſtandard of Judas the Gaulonite <note n="42" place="bottom">Joſeph. Antiquitat. xviii. 1, 2. Tillemont, Ruine des Juifs, p. 742. The ſons of Judas were crucified in the time of Claudius. His grandſon Eleazar, after Jeruſalem was taken, defended a ſtrong fortreſs with 960 of his moſt deſperate followers. When the batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ram had made a breach, they turned their ſwords againſt their wives, their children, and at length againſt their own breaſts. They died to the laſt man.</note>. The former were the friends, the latter were the enemies, of humankind; and the only reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between them conſiſted in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible conſtancy, which, in the defence of their cauſe, rendered them inſenſible of death and tortures. The followers of Judas, who impelled their countrymen into rebellion, were ſoon buried under the ruins of Jeruſalem; whilſt thoſe of Jeſus, known by the more celebrated name of Chriſtians, diffuſed themſelves over the Roman empire. How natural was it for Tacitus, in the time of Hadrian, to appropriate to the Chriſtians,

the guilt and the ſufferings, which he might, with far greater truth and juſtice, have attributed to a ſect whoſe odious memory was almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed! 4. Whatever opinion may be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of this conjecture (for it is no more than a conjecture), it is evident that the effect, as well as the cauſe, of Nero's perſecution, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the walls of Rome <note n="43" place="bottom">See Dodwell.

Since the officers of the revenue extended their unjuſt claim to many perſons who were ſtrangers to the blood or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Jews, it was impoſſible that the Chriſtians, who had ſo often ſheltered themſelves under the ſhade of the ſynagogue, ſhould now eſcape this rapacious perſecution.

A devout reſpect for the virginity of the mother of God, ſuggeſted to the Gnoſtics, and afterwards to the orthodox Greeks, the expedient of beſtowing a ſecond wife on Joſeph. The Latins (from the time of Jerome) improved on that hint, aſſerted the perpetual celibacy of Joſeph, and juſtified by many ſimilar examples the new interpretation that Jude, as well as Simon and James, who are ſtyled the brothers of Jeſus Chriſt, were only his firſt couſins.

On the ſtrength of ſo probable an interpretation, and too eagerly admitting the ſuſpicions of a tyrant as an evidence of their honourable crime, the church has placed both Clemens and Domitilla among its firſt martyrs, and has branded the cruelty of Domitian with the name of the ſecond perſecution. But this perſecution (if it deſerves that epithet) was of no long duration.

About ten years afterwards, under the reign <note place="margin">Ignorance of Pliny concerning the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</note> of Trajan, the younger Pliny was intruſted by his friend and maſter with the government of Bithynia and Pontus. He ſoon found himſelf at a loſs to determine by what rule of juſtice or of law he ſhould direct his conduct in the execution of an office the moſt repugnant to his humanity. Pliny had never aſſiſted at any judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the Chriſtians, with whoſe name alone he ſeems to be acquainted; and he was totally uninformed with regard to the nature of their guilt, the method of their conviction, and the degree of their puniſhment. In this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity he had recourſe to his uſual expedient, of ſubmitting to the wiſdom of Trajan an impartial, and in ſome reſpects, a favourable, account of the new ſuperſtition, requeſting the emperor, that he would condeſcend to reſolve his doubts, and to inſtruct his ignorance <note n="57" place="bottom">Plin.

From <hi>his</hi> ignorance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may derive ſome uſeful information.

Tertullian (Apolog. c. 5.) conſiders this reſcript as a relaxation of the ancient penal laws, "quas Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus ex parte fruſtratus eſt:" and yet Tertullian, in another part or his Apologiſts, expoſes the inconſiſtency of prohibiting inquiries, and enjoining puniſhments.</note>. Inſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the implacable zeal of an inquiſitor,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0034700102:434"/>
anxious to diſcover the moſt minute particles of hereſy, and exulting in the number of his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims, the emperor expreſſes much more ſolicitude to protect the ſecurity of the innocent, than to prevent the eſcape of the guilty. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the difficulty of fixing any general plan; but he lays down two ſalutary rules, which often afforded relief and ſupport to the diſtreſſed Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Though he directs the magiſtrates to puniſh ſuch perſons as are legally convicted, he prohibits them, with a very humane inconſiſtency, from making any inquiries concerning the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed criminals. Nor was the magiſtrate allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proceed on every kind of information. Anonymous charges the emperor rejects, as too repugnant to the equity of his government; and he ſtrictly requires, for the conviction of thoſe to whom the guilt of Chriſtianity is imputed, the poſitive evidence of a fair and open accuſer. It is likewiſe probable, that the perſons who aſſumed ſo invidious an office, were obliged to declare the grounds of their ſuſpicions, to ſpecify (both in reſpect to time and place) the ſecret aſſemblies, which their Chriſtian adverſary had frequented, and to diſcloſe a great number of circumſtances, which were concealed with the moſt vigilant jealouſy from the eye of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane. If they ſucceeded in their proſecution, they were expoſed to the reſentment of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and active party, to the cenſure of the more liberal portion of mankind, and to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy which, in every age and country, has

If, on the contrary, they failed in their proofs, they incurred the ſevere and perhaps capital penalty, which, according to a law publiſhed by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Hadrian, was inflicted on thoſe who falſely attributed to their fellow-citizens the crime of Chriſtianity. The violence of perſonal or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious animoſity might ſometimes prevail over the moſt natural apprehenſions of diſgrace and danger; but it cannot ſurely be imagined, that accuſations of ſo unpromiſing an appearance were either lightly or frequently undertaken by the Pagan ſubjects of the Roman empire <note n="60" place="bottom">Euſebius (Hiſt.

            <p>The expedient which was employed to elude <note place="margin">Popular clamours.</note> the prudence of the laws, affords a ſufficient proof how effectually they diſappointed the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous deſigns of private malice or ſuperſtitious zeal. In a large and tumultuous aſſembly the reſtraints of fear and ſhame, ſo forcible on the minds of individuals, are deprived of the greateſt part of their influence. The pious Chriſtian, as he was deſirous to obtain or to eſcape the glory of martyrdom, expected, either with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience or with terror, the ſtated returns of the public games and feſtivals. On thoſe occaſions, the inhabitants of the great cities of the empire were collected in the circus of the theatre, where every circumſtance of the place, as well as of the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0034700102:436"/>
ceremony, contributed to kindle their devotion, and to extinguiſh their humanity. Whilſt the numerous ſpectators, crowned with garlands, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with incenſe, purified with the blood of victims, and ſurrounded with the altars and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of their tutelar deities, reſigned themſelves to the enjoyment of pleaſures, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an eſſential part of their religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; they recollected that the Chriſtians alone abhorred the gods of mankind, and by their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and melancholy on theſe ſolemn feſtivals, ſeemed to inſult or to lament the public felicity. If the empire had been afflicted by any recent calamity, by a plague, a famine, or an unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful war; if the Tyber had, or if the Nile had not, riſen beyond its banks; if the earth had ſhaken, or if the temperate order of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had been interrupted, the ſuperſtitious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans were convinced, that the crimes and the impiety of the Chriſtians, who were ſpared by the exceſſive lenity of the government, had at length provoked the Divine Juſtice. It was not among a licentious and exaſperated populace, that the forms of legal proceedings could be obſerved; it was not in an amphitheatre, ſtained with the blood of wild beaſts and gladiators, that the voice of compaſſion could be heard. The impatient clamours of the multitude denounced the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians as the enemies of gods and men, doomed them to the ſevereſt tortures, and venturing to accuſe by name ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed of the new ſectaries, required with irreſiſtible vehemence that they ſhould be inſtantly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

But the wiſdom of the emperors protected the church from the danger of theſe tumultuous clamours and irregular accuſations, which they juſtly cenſured as repugnant both to the firmneſs and to the equity of their adminiſtration.

It was not ſo much the paſt offence, as the actual reſiſtance, which excited the indignation of the magiſtrate.

It was eſteemed the duty of a humane judge to endeavour to reclaim, rather than to puniſh, thoſe deluded enthuſiaſts. Varying his tone according to the age, the ſex, or the ſituation of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, he frequently condeſcended to ſet before their eyes every circumſtance which could render life more pleaſing, or death more terrible; and to ſolicit, nay to intreat, them, that they would ſhew ſome compaſſion to themſelves, to their families, and to their friends <note n="63" place="bottom">See the reſcript of Trajan, and the conduct of Pliny.

If threats and perſuaſions proved ineffectual, he had often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to violence; the ſcourge and the rack were called in to ſupply the deficiency of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and every art of cruelty was employed to ſubdue ſuch inflexible, and, as it appeared to the Pagans, ſuch criminal, obſtinacy. The ancient apologiſts of Chriſtianity have cenſured, with equal truth and ſeverity, the irregular conduct of their perſecutors, who, contrary to every principle of judicial proceeding, admitted the uſe of torture, in order to obtain, not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but a denial, of the crime which was the object of their inquiry <note n="64" place="bottom">In particular, ſee Tertullian (Apolog. c. 2, 3.), and Lactantius (Inſtitut.

The monks of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, who, in their peaceful ſolitudes, entertained themſelves with diverſifying the deaths and ſufferings of the primitive martyrs, have frequently invented torments of a much more refined and ingenious nature.

It is related, that pious females, who were prepared to deſpiſe death, were ſometimes condemned to a more ſevere trial, and called upon to determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſet a higher value on their religion or on their chaſtity. The youths to whoſe licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious embraces they were abandoned, received a ſolemn exhortation from the judge, to exert their moſt ſtrenuous efforts to maintain the honour of Venus againſt the impious virgin who refuſed to burn incenſe on her altars.

The experience, however, of the life of Cyprian, is ſufficient to prove, that our fancy has exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated the perilous ſituation of a Chriſtian biſhop; and that the dangers to which he was
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0034700102:444"/>
expoſed were leſs imminent than thoſe which temporal ambition is always prepared to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the purſuit of honours. Four Roman emperors, with their families, their favourites, and their adherents, periſhed by the ſword in the ſpace of ten years, during which, the biſhop of Carthage guided by his authority and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the counſels of the African church. It was only in the third year of his adminiſtration, that he had reaſon, during a few months, to apprehend the ſevere edicts of Decius, the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance <note place="margin">His dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and flight.</note> of the magiſtrate, and the clamours of the multitude, who loudly demanded, that Cyprian, the leader of the Chriſtians, ſhould be thrown to the lions. Prudence ſuggeſted the neceſſity of a temporary retreat, and the voice of prudence was obeyed. He withdrew himſelf into an obſcure ſolitude, from whence he could maintain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant correſpondence with the clergy and people of Carthage; and concealing himſelf till the tempeſt was paſt, he preſerved his life, without relinquiſhing either his power or his reputation. His extreme caution did not however eſcape the cenſure of the more rigid Chriſtians who lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the reproaches of his perſonal enemies who inſulted, a conduct which they conſidered as a puſillanimous and criminal deſertion of the moſt ſacred duty <note n="77" place="bottom">See the polite but ſevere epiſtle of the clergy of Rome, to the biſhop of Carthage (Cyprian, Epiſt. 8, 9.).

Cyprian replied without heſitation, that he was a Chriſtian and a biſhop, devoted to the worſhip of the true and only Deity, to whom he offered up his daily ſupplications for the ſafety and proſperity of the two emperors, his lawful ſovereigns. With modeſt confidence he pleaded the privilege of a citizen, in refuſing to give any anſwer to ſome invidious and indeed illegal queſtions which the proconſul had propoſed. A ſentence of baniſhment was pronounced as the penalty of Cyprian's diſobedience; and he was conducted without delay to Curubis, a free and maritime city of Zeugitania, in a pleaſant ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a fertile territory, and at the diſtance of about forty miles from Carthage <note n="82" place="bottom">See Plin.

The exiled biſhop enjoyed the conveniencies of life and the conſciouſneſs of virtue.

On the arrival of a new proconſul in the province, the fortune of Cyprian appeared for ſome time to wear a ſtill
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:0034700102:447"/>
more favourable aſpect. He was recalled from baniſhment; and though not yet permitted to return to Carthage, his own gardens in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the capital were aſſigned for the place of his reſidence <note n="84" place="bottom">Upon his converſion, he had ſold thoſe gardens for the benefit of the poor. The indulgence of God (moſt probably the liberality of ſome Chriſtian friend) reſtored them to Cyprian. See Pontius, c. 15.</note>.</p>
            <p>At length, exactly one year <note n="85" place="bottom">When Cyprian, a twelvemonth before, was ſent into exile, he dreamt that he ſhould be put to death the next day. The event made it neceſſary to explain that word, as ſignifying a year. Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, c. 12.</note> after Cyprian <note place="margin">His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> was firſt apprehended, Galerius Maximus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul of Africa, received the Imperial warrant for the execution of the Chriſtian teachers. The biſhop of Carthage was ſenſible that he ſhould be ſingled out for one of the firſt victims; and the frailty of nature tempted him to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a ſecret flight, from the danger and the honour of martyrdom: but ſoon recovering that fortitude which his character required, he returned to his gardens, and patiently expected the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of death. Two officers of rank, who were intruſted with that commiſſion, placed Cyprian between them in a chariot; and as the proconſul was not then at leiſure, they conducted him, not to a priſon, but to a private houſe in Carthage, which belonged to one of them. An elegant ſupper was provided for the entertainment of the biſhop, and his Chriſtian friends were permitted for the laſt time to enjoy his ſociety, whilſt the ſtreets were filled with a multitude of the faithful,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0034700102:448"/>
anxious and alarmed at the approaching fate of their ſpiritual father <note n="86" place="bottom">Pontius (c. 15.) acknowledges that Cyprian, with whom he ſupped, paſſed the night cuſtodiâ delicatâ.

In the morning he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the tribunal of the proconſul, who, after informing himſelf of the name and ſituation of Cyprian, commanded him to offer ſacrifice, and preſſed him to reflect on the conſequences of his diſobedience. The refuſal of Cyprian was firm and deciſive; and the magiſtrate, when he had taken the opinion of his council, pronounced with ſome reluctance the ſentence of death. It was conceived in the following terms: <q>That Thaſcius Cyprianus ſhould be immediately beheaded, as the enemy of the gods of Rome, and as the chief and ringleader of a criminal aſſociation, which he had ſeduced into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious reſiſtance againſt the laws of the moſt holy emperors, Valerian and Gallienus <note n="87" place="bottom">See the original ſentence in the Acts, c. 4. and in Pontius, c. 17. The latter expreſſes it in a more rhetorical manner.</note>.</q> The manner of his execution was the mildeſt and leaſt painful that could be inflicted on a perſon convicted of any capital offence: nor was the uſe of torture admitted to obtain from the biſhop of Carthage either the recantation of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or the diſcovery of his accomplices.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the ſentence was proclaimed, a <note place="margin">His mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.</note> general cry of "We will die with him," aroſe at once among the liſtening multitude of Chriſtians

who waited before the palace gates. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous effuſions of their zeal and affection were neither ſerviceable to Cyprian nor dangerous to themſelves. He was led away under a guard of tribunes and centurions, without reſiſtance and without inſult, to the place of his execution, a ſpacious and level plain near the city, which was already filled with great numbers of ſpectators. His faithful preſbyters and deacons were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to accompany their holy biſhop. They aſſiſted him in laying aſide his upper garment, ſpread linen on the ground to catch the precious relics of his blood, and received his orders to beſtow five-and-twenty pieces of gold on the executioner. The martyr then covered his face with his hands, and at one blow his head was ſeparated from his body. His corpſe remained during ſome hours expoſed to the curioſity of the Gentiles: but in the night it was removed, and tranſported in a triumphal proceſſion and with a ſplendid illumination to the burial-place of the Chriſtians. The funeral of Cyprian was publicly celebrated without receiving any interruption from the Roman magiſtrates; and thoſe among the faithful who had performed the laſt offices to his perſon and his memory, were ſecure from the danger of inquiry or of puniſhment. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that of ſo great a multitude of biſhops in the province of Africa, Cyprian was the firſt who was eſteemed worthy to obtain the crown of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom <note n="88" place="bottom">Pontius, c. 19.

It was in the choice of Cyprian either to die a martyr or to live an apoſtate: but on that choice depended the alternative of honour or <note place="margin">Various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> infamy. Could we ſuppoſe that the biſhop of Carthage had employed the profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith only as the inſtrument of his avarice or ambition, it was ſtill incumbent on him to ſupport the character which he had aſſumed <note n="89" place="bottom">Whatever opinion we may entertain of the character or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Thomas Becket, we muſt acknowledge that he ſuffered death with a conſtancy not unworthy of the primitive martyrs. See Lord Lyttelton's Hiſtory of Henry II. vol. ii. p. 592, &amp;c.</note>; and, if he poſſeſſed the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of manly fortitude, rather to expoſe himſelf to the moſt cruel tortures, than by a ſingle act to exchange the reputation of a whole life, for the abhorrence of his Chriſtian brethren and the contempt of the Gentile world. But if the zeal of Cyprian was ſupported by the ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the truth of thoſe doctrines which he preached, the crown of martyrdom muſt have appeared to him as an object of deſire rather than of terror.

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0034700102:451"/>
the fire of martyrdom ſupplied every defect and expiated every ſin; that while the ſouls of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Chriſtians were obliged to paſs through a ſlow and painful purification, the triumphant ſufferers entered into the immediate fruition of eternal bliſs, where, in the ſociety of the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, the apoſtles, and the prophets, they reigned with Chriſt, and acted as his aſſeſſors in the univerſal judgment of mankind. The aſſurance of a laſting reputation upon earth, a motive ſo congenial to the vanity of human nature, often ſerved to animate the courage of the martyrs. The honours which Rome or Athens beſtowed on thoſe citizens who had fallen in the cauſe of their country, were cold and unmeaning demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of reſpect, when compared with the ardent gratitude and devotion which the primitive church expreſſed towards the victorious cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the faith. The annual commemoration of their virtues and ſufferings was obſerved as a ſacred ceremony, and at length terminated in religious worſhip. Among the Chriſtians who had publicly confeſſed their religious principles, thoſe, who (as it very frequently happened) had been diſmiſſed from the tribunal or the priſons of the Pagan magiſtrates, obtained ſuch honours as were juſtly due to their imperfect martyrdom and their generous reſolution. The moſt pious females courted the permiſſion of imprinting kiſſes on the fetters which they had worn, and on the wounds which they had received.

The diſtreſs of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, the ſeaſonable tempeſt of rain and hail, of thunder and of lightning, and the diſmay and defeat of the barbarians, have been celebrated by the eloquence of ſeveral Pagan writers.

Notwithſtanding the cruel diſpoſition of Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, the effects of his reſentment againſt the Chriſtians were of a very local and temporary <note place="margin">Of Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, and Decius.</note> nature, and the pious Origen, who had been proſcribed as a devoted victim, was ſtill reſerved to convey the truths of the Goſpel to the ear of monarchs <note n="118" place="bottom">Oroſius, l. vii. c. 19. mentions Origen as the object of Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imin's reſentment; and Firmilianus, a Cappadocian biſhop of that age, gives a juſt and confined idea of this perſecution (apud Cyprian.

The public and even partial favour of Philip towards the ſectaries of the new religion, and his conſtant reverence for the miniſters of the church, gave ſome colour to the ſuſpicion, which prevailed in his own times, that the emperor himſelf was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a convert to the faith <note n="119" place="bottom">The mention of thoſe princes who were publicly ſuppoſed to be Chriſtians, as we find it in an epiſtle of Dionyſius of Alexandria (ap.

ſome grounds for a fable which was afterwards invented, that he had been purified by confeſſion and pennance from the guilt contracted by the murder of his innocent predeceſſor <note n="120" place="bottom">Euſeb. l. vi. c. 34.

The fall <note place="margin">A.

The virtues of that prince will ſcarcely allow us to ſuſpect that he was actuated by a mean reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the favourites of his predeceſſor, and it is more reaſonable to believe, that in the proſecution of his general deſign to reſtore the purity of Roman manners, he was deſirous of delivering the empire from what he condemned as a recent and criminal ſuperſtition. The biſhops of the moſt conſiderable cities were removed by exile or death: the vigilance of the magiſtrates prevented the clergy of Rome during ſixteen months from proceeding to a new election; and it was the opinion of the Chriſtians, that the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:0034700102:468"/>
emperor would more patiently endure a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor for the purple, than a biſhop in the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <note n="122" place="bottom">Euſeb. l. vi. c. 39.

The wealth of that prelate was a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence of his guilt, ſince it was neither derived from the inheritance of his fathers, nor acquired by the arts of honeſt induſtry. But Paul conſidered the ſervice of the church as a very lucrative profeſſion <note n="126" place="bottom">Paul was better pleaſed with the title of <hi>Ducenarius,</hi> than with that of biſhop. The <hi>Ducenarius</hi> was an Imperial procurator, ſo called from his ſalary of two hundred <hi>Seſtertia,</hi> or 1,600 l. a year. (See Salmaſius ad Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 124.) Some critics ſuppoſe, that the biſhop of Antioch had actually obtained ſuch an office from Zenobia, while others conſider it only as a figurative expreſſion of his pomp and inſolence.</note>. His eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction was venal and rapacious; he extorted
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:0034700102:470"/>
frequent contributions from the moſt opulent of the faithful, and converted to his own uſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the public revenue. By his pride and luxury, the Chriſtian religion was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered odious in the eyes of the Gentiles. His council chamber and his throne, the ſplendour with which he appeared in public, the ſuppliant crowd who ſolicited his attention, the multitude of letters and petitions to which he dictated his anſwers, and the perpetual hurry of buſineſs in which he was involved, were circumſtances much better ſuited to the ſtate of a civil magiſtrate <note n="127" place="bottom">Simony was not unknown in thoſe times; and the clergy ſometimes bought what they intended to ſell.

When he harangued his people from the pulpit, Paul affected the figurative ſtyle and the theatrical geſtures of an Aſiatic ſophiſt, while the cathedral reſounded with the loudeſt and moſt extravagant acclamations in the praiſe of his divine eloquence. Againſt thoſe who reſiſted his power, or refuſed to flatter his vanity, the prelate of Antioch was arrogant, rigid, and inexorable; but he relaxed the diſcipline, and laviſhed the treaſures, of the church on his dependent clergy, who were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to imitate their maſter in the gratification of every ſenſual appetite. For Paul indulged himſelf very freely in the pleaſures of the table, and he had received into the epiſcopal palace two

Some nice and ſubtle errors, which he imprudently adopted and obſtinately maintained, concerning the doctrine of the Trinity, excited the zeal and indignation of the eaſtern churches <note n="129" place="bottom">His hereſy (like thoſe of Noetus and Sabellius, in the ſame century) tended to confound the myſterious diſtinction of the divine perſons. See Moſheim, p. 702, &amp;c.</note>. From Egypt to the Euxine ſea, the biſhops were in arms and in motion. Several councils were held, confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were publiſhed, excommunications were pronounced, ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and refuſed, treaties were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and violated, and at length Paul of Samoſata was degraded from his epiſcopal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, by the ſentence of ſeventy or eighty biſhops, who aſſembled for that purpoſe at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, and who, without conſulting the rights of the clergy or people, appointed a ſucceſſor by their own authority. The manifeſt irregularity of this proceeding increaſed the numbers of the diſcontented faction; and as Paul, who was no

ſtranger to the arts of courts, had inſinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the favour of Zenobia, he maintained above four years the poſſeſſion of the epiſcopal houſe and office. The victory of Aurelian chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the face of the Eaſt, and the two contending parties, who applied to each other the epithets of ſchiſm and hereſy, were either commanded or permitted to plead their cauſe before the tribunal of the conqueror. This public and very ſingular trial affords a convincing proof, that the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the property, the privileges, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal policy, of the Chriſtians were acknowledged, if not by the laws, at leaſt by the magiſtrates of the empire. As a Pagan and as a ſoldier, it could ſcarcely by expected that Aurelian ſhould enter into the diſcuſſion, whether the ſentiments of Paul or thoſe of his adverſaries were moſt agreeable to the true ſtandard of the orthodox faith. His determination, however, was founded on the general principles of equity and reaſon. <note place="margin">The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is executed by Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</note> He conſidered the biſhops of Italy as the moſt impartial and reſpectable judges among the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and as ſoon as he was informed, that they <note place="margin">A.

But while we applaud the juſtice, we ſhould not overlook the policy, of Aurelian; who was deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of reſtoring and cementing the dependence

The preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters aſpired to the epiſcopal office, which every day became an object more worthy of their ambition.

Chriſtians ſometimes offered the moſt ſpecious pretences. A ſentence of death was executed upon Maximilianus, an African youth, who had been produced by his own father before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate as a ſufficient and legal recruit, but who obſtinately perſiſted in declaring, that his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would not permit him to embrace the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a ſoldier <note n="145" place="bottom">See the Acta Sincera, p. 299.

It could ſcarcely be expected that any government ſhould ſuffer the action of Marcellus the Centurion to paſs with impunity. On the day of a public feſtival, that officer threw away his belt, his arms, and the enſigns of his office, and exclaimed with a loud voice, that he would obey none but Jeſus Chriſt the eternal King, and that he renounced for ever the uſe of carnal weapons, and the ſervice of an idolatrous maſter. The ſoldiers, as ſoon as they recovered from their aſtoniſhment, ſecured the perſon of Marcellus. He was examined in the city of Tingi by the preſident of that part of Mauritania; and as he was convicted by his own confeſſion, he was condemned and beheaded for

Examples of ſuch a nature ſavour much leſs of religious perſecution than of martial or even civil law: but they ſerved to alienate the mind of the emperors, to juſtify the ſeverity of Galerius, who diſmiſſed a great number of Chriſtian officers from their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and to authorize the opinion, that a ſect of enthuſiaſts, which avowed principles ſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the public ſafety, muſt either remain uſeleſs, or would ſoon become dangerous, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the empire.</p>

Perhaps they repreſented, that the glorious work of the deliverance of the empire was left imperfect, as long as an independent people was permitted to ſubſiſt and multiply in the heart of the provinces. The Chriſtians (it might ſpeciouſly be alleged), renouncing the gods and the inſtitutions of Rome, had conſtituted a diſtinct republic, which might yet be ſuppreſſed before it had acquired any military force: but which was already governed by its own laws and magiſtrates, was poſſeſſed of a public treaſure, and was intimately connected in all its parts, by the frequent aſſemblies of the biſhops, to whoſe decrees their numerous and opulent congregations yielded an implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Arguments like theſe, may ſeem to have determined the reluctant mind of Diocletian to embrace a new ſyſtem of perſecution: but though we may ſuſpect, it is not in our power to relate, the ſecret intrigues of the palace, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate views and reſentments, the jealouſy of women or eunuchs, and all thoſe trifling but deciſive cauſes which ſo often influence the fate of empires, and the counſels of the wiſeſt monarchs <note n="148" place="bottom">The only circumſtance which we can diſcover, is the devotion and jealouſy of the mother of Galerius.

The pleaſure of the emperors was at length ſignified to the Chriſtians, who, during the courſe of this melancholy winter, had expected, with <note place="margin">Demolition of the church of Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.

               </note>, accompanied by ſeveral generals, tribunes, and officers of the revenue, repaired to the principal church of Nicomedia, which was ſituated on an eminence in the moſt populous and beautiful part of the city. The doors were inſtantly broke open; they ruſhed into the ſanctuary; and as they ſearched in vain for ſome viſible object of worſhip, they were obliged to content themſelves with committing to the flames the volumes of holy ſcripture. The miniſters of Diocletian were followed by a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous body of guards and pioneers, who marched in order of battle, and were provided with all the inſtruments uſed in the deſtruction of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied cities.

            <p>The next day the general edict of perſecution was publiſhed <note n="152" place="bottom">Moſheim (p. 922—926.), from many ſcattered paſſages of Lactantius and Euſebius, has collected a very juſt and accurate notion of this edict; though he ſometimes deviates into conjecture and refinement.</note>; and though Diocletian, ſtill <note place="margin">The firſt edict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians. 24th of February.</note> averſe to the effuſion of blood, had moderated the fury of Galerius, who propoſed, that every one refuſing to offer ſacrifice, ſhould immediately be burnt alive, the penalties inflicted on the obſtinacy of the Chriſtians might be deemed ſufficiently rigorous and effectual. It was enacted, that their churches, in all the provinces of the empire, ſhould be demoliſhed to their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the puniſhment of death was denounced againſt all who ſhould preſume to hold any ſecret aſſemblies for the purpoſe of religious worſhip. The philoſophers, who now aſſumed the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy office of directing the blind zeal of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had diligently ſtudied the nature and genius of the Chriſtian religion; and as they were not ignorant that the ſpeculative doctrines of the faith were ſuppoſed to be contained in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the prophets, of the evangeliſts, and of the apoſtles, they moſt probably ſuggeſted the order, that the biſhops and preſbyters ſhould deliver all their ſacred books into the hands of the magiſtrates; who were commanded, under the ſevereſt penalties, to burn them in a public
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0034700102:484"/>
and ſolemn manner. By the ſame edict, the property of the church was at once confiſcated; and the ſeveral parts of which it might conſiſt, were either ſold to the higheſt bidder, united to the Imperial domain, beſtowed on the cities and corporations, or granted to the ſolicitations of rapacious courtiers. After taking ſuch effectual meaſures to aboliſh the worſhip, and to diſſolve the government, of the Chriſtians, it was thought neceſſary to ſubject to the moſt intolerable hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips the condition of thoſe perverſe individuals who ſhould ſtill reject the religion of Nature, of Rome, and of their anceſtors. Perſons of a liberal birth were declared incapable of holding any honours or employments; ſlaves were for ever deprived of the hopes of freedom, and the whole body of the people were put out of the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law. The judges were authorized to hear and to determine every action that was brought againſt a Chriſtian. But the Chriſtians were not permitted to complain of any injury which they themſelves had ſuffered; and thus thoſe unfortunate ſectaries were expoſed to the ſeverity, while they were excluded from the benefits, of public juſtice. This new ſpecies of martyrdom, ſo painful and lingering, ſo obſcure and ignominious, was, perhaps, the moſt proper to weary the conſtancy of the faithful: nor can it be doubted that the paſſions and intereſt of mankind were diſpoſed on this occaſion to ſecond the deſigns of the emperors. But the policy of a well-ordered government muſt ſometimes have
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:0034700102:485"/>
interpoſed in behalf of the oppreſſed Chriſtians; nor was it poſſible for the Roman princes entirely to remove the apprehenſion of puniſhment, or to connive at every act of fraud and violence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing their own authority and the reſt of their ſubjects to the moſt alarming dangers <note n="153" place="bottom">Many ages afterwards, Edward I. practiſed, with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, the ſame mode of perſecution againſt the clergy of England.

His offence, according to the mildeſt laws, amounted to treaſon, and deſerved death. And if it be true that he was a perſon of rank and education, thoſe circumſtances could ſerve only to aggravate his guilt. He was burnt, or rather roaſted, by a ſlow fire; and his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, zealous to revenge the perſonal inſult which had been offered to the emperors, exhauſted every refinement of cruelty, without being able to ſubdue his patience, or to alter the ſteady and inſulting ſmile which in his dying agonies he ſtill preſerved in his countenance. The Chriſtians, though they confeſſed that his conduct had not been ſtrictly conformable to the laws of prudence, admired the divine fervour of his zeal; and the exceſſive commendations which they laviſhed on the memory of their hero and martyr, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:0034700102:486"/>

            <p>His fears were ſoon alarmed by the view of a <note place="margin">Fire of the palace of Nicomedia imputed to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</note> danger from which he very narrowly eſcaped. Within fifteen days the palace of Nicomedia, and even the bedchamber of Diocletian, were twice in flames; and though both times they were extinguiſhed without any material damage, the ſingular repetition of the fire was juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an evident proof that it had not been the effect of chance or negligence. The ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion naturally fell on the Chriſtians; and it was ſuggeſted, with ſome degree of probability, that thoſe deſperate fanatics, provoked by their preſent ſufferings, and apprehenſive of impending calamities, had entered into a conſpiracy with their faithful brethren, the eunuchs of the palace, againſt the lives of two emperors, whom they deteſted as the irreconcileable enemies of the church of God. Jealouſy and reſentment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in every breaſt, but eſpecially in that of Diocletian. A great number of perſons, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed either by the offices which they had filled, or by the favour which they had enjoyed, were thrown into priſon. Every mode of torture was put in practice, and the court, as well as city, was polluted with many bloody executions <note n="155" place="bottom">Lactantius de M. P. c. 13, 14.

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0034700102:487"/>
But as it was found impoſſible to extort any diſcovery of this myſterious tranſaction, it ſeems incumbent on us either to preſume the innocence, or to admire the reſolution, of the ſufferers. A few days afterwards Galerius haſtily withdrew himſelf from Nicomedia, declaring, that if he delayed his departure from that devoted palace, he ſhould fall a ſacrifice to the rage of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. The eccleſiaſtical hiſtorians, from whom alone we derive a partial and imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this perſecution, are at a loſs how to account for the fears and dangers of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Two of theſe writers, a Prince and a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician, were eye-witneſſes of the fire of Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media. The one aſcribes it to lightning, and the divine wrath; the other affirms, that it was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the malice of Galerius himſelf <note n="156" place="bottom">See Lactantius, Euſebius, and Conſtantine, ad Coetum Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum, c. 25. Euſebius confeſſes his ignorance of the cauſe of the fire.</note>.</p>
            <p>As the edict againſt the Chriſtians was deſigned <note place="margin">Execution of the firſt edict.</note> for a general law of the whole empire, and as Diocletian and Galerius, though they might not wait for the conſent, were aſſured of the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, of the weſtern princes, it would appear more conſonant to our ideas of policy, that the governors of all the provinces ſhould have received ſecret inſtructions to publiſh, on one and the ſame day, this declaration of war within their reſpective departments. It was at leaſt to be
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:0034700102:488"/>
expected, that the convenience of the public highways and eſtabliſhed poſts would have enabled the emperors to tranſmit their orders with the utmoſt diſpatch from the palace of Nicomedia to the extremities of the Roman world; and that they would not have ſuffered fifty days to elapſe, before the edict was publiſhed in Syria, and near four months before it was ſignified to the cities of Africa <note n="157" place="bottom">Tillemont, Memoires Eccleſiaſt. tom. v. part i. p. 43.</note>. This delay may perhaps be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the cautious temper of Diocletian, who had yielded a reluctant conſent to the meaſures of perſecution, and who was deſirous of trying the experiment under his more immediate eye, before he gave way to the diſorders and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which it muſt inevitably occaſion in the diſtant provinces. At firſt, indeed, the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates were reſtrained from the effuſion of blood; but the uſe of every other ſeverity was permitted and even recommended to their zeal; nor could the Chriſtians, though they cheerfully reſigned the ornaments of their churches, reſolve to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their religious aſſemblies, or to deliver their ſacred books to the flames. The pious obſtinacy of Felix, an African biſhop, appears to have embarraſſed the ſubordinate miniſters of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The curator of his city ſent him in chains to the proconſul. The proconſul tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to the Praetorian praefect of Italy; and Felix, who diſdained even to give an evaſive anſwer, was at length beheaded at Venuſia, in Lucania, a place on which the birth of Horace

This precedent, and perhaps ſome Imperial reſcript, which was iſſued in conſequence of it, appeared to authorize the governors of provinces, in puniſhing with death the refuſal of the Chriſtians to deliver up their ſacred books. There were undoubtedly many perſons who embraced this opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the crown of martyrdom; but there were likewiſe too many who purchaſed an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious life, by diſcovering and betraying the holy ſcripture into the hands of infidels. A great number even of biſhops and preſbyters acquired, by this criminal compliance, the opprobrious epithet of <hi>Traditors;</hi> and their offence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of much preſent ſcandal, and of much future diſcord, in the African Church <note n="159" place="bottom">See the firſt book of Optatus of Milevis againſt the Donatiſts at Paris, 1700.

But the ruin of the churches was eaſily effected by the authority of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the labour of the Pagans. In ſome provinces, however, the magiſtrates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with ſhutting up the places of
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:0034700102:490"/>
religious worſhip. In others, they more literally complied with the terms of the edict; and after taking away the doors, the benches, and the pulpit, which they burnt, as it were in a funeral pile, they completely demoliſhed the remainder of the edifice <note n="160" place="bottom">The ancient monuments, publiſhed at the end of Optatus, p. 261, &amp;c. deſcribe, in a very circumſtantial manner, the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the governors in the deſtruction of churches. They made a minute inventory of the plate, &amp;c. which they found in them. That of the church of Cirta, in Numidia, is ſtill extant. It conſiſted of two chalices of gold, and ſix of ſilver; ſix urns, one kettle, ſeven lamps, all likewiſe of ſilver; beſides a large quantity of braſs uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, and wearing apparel.</note>. It is perhaps to this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly occaſion, that we ſhould apply a very remarkable ſtory, which is related with ſo many circumſtances of variety and improbability, that it ſerves rather to excite than to ſatisfy our curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity. In a ſmall town in Phrygia, of whoſe name as well as ſituation we are left ignorant, it ſhould ſeem, that the magiſtrates and the body of the people had embraced the Chriſtian ſaith; and as ſome reſiſtance might be apprehended to the execution of the edict, the governor of the province was ſupported by a numerous detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of legionaries. On their approach the citizens threw themſelves into the church, with the reſolution either of defending by arms that ſacred edifice, or of periſhing in its ruins. They indignantly rejected the notice and permiſſion which was given them, to retire, till the ſoldiers, provoked by their obſtinate refuſal, ſet fire to the building on all ſides, and conſumed, by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

His ancient Latin tranſlator, Rufinus, adds the important circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the permiſſion given to the inhabitants of retiring from thence. As Phrygia reached to the confines of Iſauria, it is poſſible that the reſtleſs temper of thoſe independent Barbarians may have contributed to this misfortune.</note>.</p>

From Euſebius (l. ix. c. 8.) as well as from Moſes of Chorene (Hiſt. Armen. l. ii. c. 77, &amp;c.) it may be inferred, that Chriſtianity was already introduced into Armenia.</note>. The reſentment, or the fears, of Diocletian, at length tranſported him beyond the bounds of moderation, which he had hitherto preſerved, and he declared, in a ſeries of cruel edicts, his intention of aboliſhing the Chriſtian name. By the firſt of theſe edicts, the governors of the provinces were directed to apprehend all perſons of the eccleſiaſtical order; and the priſons, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined for the vileſt criminals, were ſoon filled with a multitude of biſhops, preſbyters, deacons,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:0034700102:492"/>
readers, and exorciſts. By a ſecond edict, the magiſtrates were commanded to employ every method of ſeverity, which might reclaim them from their odious ſuperſtition, and oblige them to return to the eſtabliſhed worſhip of the gods. This rigorous order was extended, by a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent edict, to the whole body of Chriſtians, who were expoſed to a violent and general perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="163" place="bottom">See Moſheim, p. 938; the text of Euſebius very plainly ſhews, that the governors, whoſe powers were enlarged, not reſtrained, by the new laws, could puniſh with death the moſt obſtinate Chriſtians, as an example to their brethren.</note>. Inſtead of thoſe ſalutary reſtraints, which had required the direct and ſolemn teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of an accuſer, it became the duty as well as the intereſt of the Imperial officers, to diſcover, to purſue, and to torment, the moſt obnoxious among the faithful. Heavy penalties were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt all who ſhould preſume to ſave a proſcribed ſectary from the juſt indignation of the gods, and of the emperors. Yet, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeverity of this law, the virtuous courage of many of the Pagans, in concealing their friends or relations, affords an honourable proof, that the rage of ſuperſtition had not extinguiſhed in their minds the ſentiments of nature and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note n="164" place="bottom">Athanaſius, p. 833. ap.

The character and ſituation of his colleagues and ſucceſſors ſometimes urged them to enforce, and ſometimes inclined them to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, the execution of theſe rigorous laws; nor can we acquire a juſt and diſtinct idea of this important period of eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, unleſs we ſeparately conſider the ſtate of Chriſtianity, in the different parts of the empire, during the ſpace of ten years, which elapſed between the firſt edicts of Diocletian, and the final peace of the church.</p>

But as long as Conſtantius remained in the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtation of Caeſar, it was not in his power openly to reject the edicts of Diocletian, or to diſobey the commands of Maximian. His au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority contributed, however, to alleviate the ſufferings which he pitied and abhorred. He conſented, with reluctance, to the ruin of the churches; but he ventured to protect the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians themſelves from the fury of the populace, and from the rigour of the laws. The provinces of Gaul (under which we may probably include thoſe of Britain) were indebted for the ſingular tranquillity which they enjoyed, to the gentle interpoſition of their ſovereign <note n="165" place="bottom">Euſebius, l. viii. c. 13.

But the former evidently ſpeaks of Conſtantius in the ſtation of Caeſar, and the latter of the ſame prince in the rank of Auguſtus.</note>. But Datianus,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:0034700102:494"/>
the preſident or governor of Spain, actuated either by zeal or policy, choſe rather to execute the public edicts of the emperors, than to underſtand the ſecret intentions of Conſtantius; and it can ſcarcely be doubted, that his provincial admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration was ſtained with the blood of a few martyrs <note n="166" place="bottom">Datianus is mentioned in Gruter's Inſcriptions, as having determined the limits between the territories of Pax Julia, and thoſe of Ebora, both cities in the ſouthern part of Luſitania. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the neighbourhood of thoſe places to Cape St. Vincent, we may ſuſpect that the celebrated deacon and martyr of that name has been inaccurately aſſigned by Prudentius, &amp;c. to Saragoſſa, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia. See the pompous hiſtory of his ſufferings, in the Memoires de Tillemont, tom. v. part ii. p. 58—85. Some critics are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the department of Conſtantius, as Caeſar, did not include Spain, which ſtill continued under the immediate juriſdiction of Maximian.</note>. The elevation of Conſtantius to the ſupreme and independent dignity of Auguſtus, gave a free ſcope to the exerciſe of his virtues, and the ſhortneſs of his reign did not prevent him from eſtabliſhing a ſyſtem of toleration, of which he left the precept and the example to his ſon Conſtantine. His fortunate ſon, from the firſt moment of his acceſſion, declaring himſelf the protector of the church, at length deſerved the appellation of the firſt emperor, who publicly profeſſed and eſtabliſhed the Chriſtian religion. The motives of his converſion, as they may variouſly be deduced from benevolence, from policy, from conviction, or from remorſe; and the progreſs of the revolution, which, under his powerful influence, and that of his ſons, rendered

            <p>The provinces of Italy and Africa experienced <note place="margin">in Italy and Africa, under Maximian and Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</note> a ſhort but violent perſecution. The rigorous edicts of Diocletian were ſtrictly and cheerfully executed by his aſſociate Maximian, who had long hated the Chriſtians, and who delighted in acts of blood and violence. In the autumn of the firſt year of the perſecution, the two empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors met at Rome to celebrate their triumph; ſeveral oppreſſive laws appear to have iſſued from their ſecret conſultations, and the diligence of the magiſtrates was animated by the preſence of their ſovereigns. After Diocletian had diveſted himſelf of the purple, Italy and Africa were adminiſtered under the name of Severus, and were expoſed, without defence, to the implacable reſentment of his maſter Galerius. Among the martyrs of Rome, Adauctus deſerves the notice of poſterity. He was of a noble family in Italy, and had raiſed himſelf, through the ſucceſſive honours of the palace, to the important office of treaſurer of the private demeſnes. Adauctus is the more remarkable for being the only perſon of rank and diſtinction who appears to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death, during the whole courſe of this general perſecution <note n="167" place="bottom">Euſebius, l. viii. c. 11.

The revolt of Maxentius immediately reſtored peace to the churches of Italy and Africa; and the ſame tyrant who oppreſſed every other claſs <note place="margin">under Maxenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</note> of his ſubjects, ſhewed himſelf juſt, humane, and even partial, towards the afflicted Chriſtians. He depended on their gratitude and affection, and very naturally preſumed, that the injuries which they had ſuffered, and the dangers which they ſtill apprehended from his moſt inveterate enemy, would ſecure the fidelity of a party al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conſiderable by their numbers and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence <note n="168" place="bottom">Euſebius, l. viii. c. 14. But as Maxentius was vanquiſhed by Conſtantine, it ſuited the purpoſe of Lactantius to place his death among thoſe of the perſecutors.</note>. Even the conduct of Maxentius towards the biſhops of Rome and Carthage, may be conſidered as the proof of his toleration, ſince it is probable that the moſt orthodox princes would adopt the ſame meaſures with regard to their eſtabliſhed clergy. Marcellus, the former of thoſe prelates, had thrown the capital into confuſion, by the ſevere penance which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on a great number of Chriſtians, who, during the late perſecution, had renounced or diſſembled their religion. The rage of faction broke out in frequent and violent ſeditions; the blood of the faithful was ſhed by each other's hands, and the exile of Marcellus, whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeems to have been leſs eminent than his zeal, was found to be the only meaſure capable of reſtoring peace to the diſtracted church of

Rome <note n="169" place="bottom">The epitaph of Marcellus is to be found in Gruter, Inſcript. p. 1172. No. 3. and it contains all that we know of his hiſtory. Marcellinus and Marcellus, whoſe names follow in the liſt of popes, are ſuppoſed by many critics to be different perſons; but the learned Abbé de Longuerre was convinced that they were one and the ſame.

               </note>. The behaviour of Menſurius, biſhop of Carthage, appears to have been ſtill more reprehenſible. A deacon of that city had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a libel againſt the emperor. The offender took refuge in the epiſcopal palace; and though it was ſomewhat early to advance any claims of eccleſiaſtical immunities, the biſhop refuſed to deliver him up to the officers of juſtice. For this treaſonable reſiſtance, Menſurius was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to court, and inſtead of receiving a legal ſentence of death or baniſhment, he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, after a ſhort examination, to return to his dioceſe <note n="170" place="bottom">Optatus contr.

Such was the happy condition of the Chriſtian ſubjects of Maxentius, that whenever they were deſirous of procuring for their own uſe any bodies of martyrs, they were obliged to purchaſe them from the moſt diſtant provinces of the Eaſt. A ſtory is related of Aglae, a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lady, deſcended from a conſular family, and poſſeſſed of ſo ample an eſtate, that it required
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:0034700102:498"/>
the management of ſeventy-three ſtewards. Among theſe, Boniface was the favourite of his miſtreſs; and as Aglae mixed love with devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is reported that he was admitted to ſhare her bed. Her fortune enabled her to gratify the pious deſire of obtaining ſome ſacred relics from the Eaſt. She intruſted Boniface with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum of gold, and a large quantity of aromatics; and her lover, attended by twelve horſemen and three covered chariots, undertook a remote pilgrimage, as far as Tarſus in Cilicia <note n="171" place="bottom">The Acts of the Paſſion of St. Boniface, which abound in miracles and declamation, are publiſhed by Ruinart (p. 283-291.), both in Greek and Latin, from the authority of very ancient manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts.</note>.</p>

As long as he commanded only the armies and provinces of Illyricum, he could with difficulty either find or make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of martyrs, in a warlike coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which had entertained the miſſionaries of the goſpel with more coldneſs and reluctance than any other part of the empire <note n="172" place="bottom">During the four firſt centuries, there exiſt few traces of either biſhops or biſhoprics in the weſtern Illyricum. It has been thought probable that the primate of Milan extended his juriſdiction over Sirmium, the capital of that great province. See the Geographia Sacra of Charles de St. Paul, p. 68-76. with the obſervations of Lucas Holſtenius.</note>. But when Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:0034700102:499"/>
had obtained the ſupreme power and the government of the Eaſt, he indulged in their fulleſt extent his zeal and cruelty, not only in the provinces of Thrace, and Aſia, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his immediate juriſdiction; but in thoſe of Syria, Paleſtine, and Egypt, where Maximin gratified his own inclination, by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rigorous obedience to the ſtern commands of his benefactor <note n="173" place="bottom">The viiith book of Euſebius, as well as the ſupplement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the martyrs of Paleſtine, principally relate to the perſecution of Galerius and Maximin. The general lamentations with which Lactantius opens the vth book of his Divine Inſtitutions, allude to their cruelty.</note>. The frequent diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his ambitious views, the experience of ſix years of perſecution, and the ſalutary reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which a lingering and painful diſtemper ſuggeſted to the mind of Galerius, at length convinced him that the moſt violent efforts of deſpotiſm are inſufficient to extirpate a whole people, or to ſubdue their religious prejudices. Deſirous of repairing the miſchief that he had occaſioned, he publiſhed in his own name, and in thoſe of Licinius and Conſtantine, a general edict, which, after a pompous recital of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial titles, proceeded in the following manner:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Among the important cares which have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied <note place="margin">Galerius publiſhes an edict of toleration.</note> our mind for the utility and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the empire, it was our intention to correct and re-eſtabliſh all things according to
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:0034700102:500"/>
the ancient laws and public diſcipline of the Romans. We were particularly deſirous of reclaiming, into the way of reaſon and nature, the deluded Chriſtians, who had renounced the religion and ceremonies inſtituted by their fathers; and preſumptuouſly deſpiſing the practice of antiquity, had invented extravagant laws and opinions according to the dictates of their fancy, and had collected a various ſociety from the different provinces of our empire. The edicts which we have publiſhed to enforce the worſhip of the gods, having expoſed many of the Chriſtians to danger and diſtreſs, many having ſuffered death, and many more, who ſtill perſiſt in their impious folly, being left deſtitute of <hi>any</hi> public exerciſe of religion, we are diſpoſed to extend to thoſe unhappy men the effects of our wonted clemency. We per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them therefore freely to profeſs their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinions, and to aſſemble in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles without fear or moleſtation, provided always that they preſerve a due reſpect to the eſtabliſhed laws and government. By another reſcript we ſhall ſignify our intentions to the judges and magiſtrates; and we hope that our indulgence will engage the Chriſtians to offer up their prayers to the deity whom they adore, for our ſafety and proſperity, for their own, and for that of the republic <note n="174" place="bottom">Euſebius (l. viii. c. 17.) has given us a Greek verſion, and Lactantius (de M.

            <p>When Galerius ſubſcribed this edict of tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Peace of the church.</note> he was well aſſured that Licinius would readily comply with the inclinations of his friend and benefactor, and that any meaſures in favour of the Chriſtians, would obtain the approbation of Conſtantine. But the emperor would not venture to inſert in the preamble the name of Maximin, whoſe conſent was of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and who ſucceeded a few days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the provinces of Aſia. In the firſt ſix months, however, of his new reign, Maximin affected to adopt the prudent counſels of his predeceſſor; and though he never condeſcended to ſecure the tranquillity of the church by a public edict, Sabinus, his Praetorian praefect, addreſſed a circular letter to all the governors and magiſtrates of the provinces, expatiating on the Imperial clemency, acknowledging the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible obſtinacy of the Chriſtians, and directing the officers of juſtice to ceaſe their ineffectual proſecutions, and to connive at the ſecret aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of thoſe enthuſiaſts. In conſequence of theſe orders, great numbers of Chriſtians were releaſed from priſon, or delivered from the mines. The confeſſors, ſinging hymns of triumph, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into their own countries; and thoſe who had yielded to the violence of the tempeſt, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited

with tears of repentance their re-admiſſion into the boſom of the church <note n="175" place="bottom">Euſebius, l. ix. c. 1. He inſerts the epiſtle of the praefect.</note>.</p>
            <p>But this treacherous calm was of ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Maximin prepares to renew the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> nor could the Chriſtians of the Eaſt place any confidence in the character of their ſovereign. Cruelty and ſuperſtition were the ruling paſſions of the ſoul of Maximin. The former ſuggeſted the means, the latter pointed out the objects, of perſecution. The emperor was devoted to the worſhip of the gods, to the ſtudy of magic, and to the belief of oracles. The prophets or phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, whom he revered as the favourites of heaven, were frequently raiſed to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of provinces, and admitted into his moſt ſecret councils. They eaſily convinced him, that the Chriſtians had been indebted for their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories to their regular diſcipline, and that the weakneſs of polytheiſm had principally flowed from a want of union and ſubordination among the miniſters of religion. A ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was therefore inſtituted, which was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently copied from the policy of the church. In all the great cities of the empire, the temples were repaired and beautified by the order of Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imin; and the officiating prieſts of the various deities were ſubjected to the authority of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior pontiff, deſtined to oppoſe the biſhop, and to promote the cauſe of paganiſm. Theſe pontiffs acknowledged, in their turn, the ſupreme juriſdiction of the metropolitans or high-prieſts of the province, who acted as the immediate
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:0034700102:503"/>
vicegerents of the emperor himſelf. A white robe was the enſign of their dignity; and theſe new prelates were carefully ſelected from the moſt noble and opulent families. By the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the magiſtrates, and of the ſacerdotal order, a great number of dutiful addreſſes were obtained, particularly from the cities of Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media, Antioch, and Tyre, which artfully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the well-known intentions of the court as the general ſenſe of the people; ſolicited the emperor to conſult the laws of juſtice rather than the dictates of his clemency; expreſſed their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of the Chriſtians, and humbly prayed that thoſe impious ſectaries might at leaſt be excluded from the limits of their reſpective ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. The anſwer of Maximin to the addreſs which he obtained from the citizens of Tyre is ſtill extant. He praiſes their zeal and devotion in terms of the higheſt ſatisfaction, deſcants on the obſtinate impiety of the Chriſtians, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays, by the readineſs with which he conſents to their baniſhment, that he conſidered himſelf as receiving, rather than as conferring, an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The prieſts as well as the magiſtrates were empowered to enforce the execution of his edicts, which were engraved on tables of braſs; and though it was recommended to them to avoid the effuſion of blood, the moſt cruel and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious puniſhments were inflicted on the refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Chriſtians <note n="176" place="bottom">See Euſebius, l. viii. c. 14. l. ix. c. 2—8.

The Aſiatic Chriſtians had every thing to dread from the ſeverity of a bigoted monarch, who prepared his meaſures of violence with ſuch <note place="margin">End of the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> deliberate policy. But a few months had ſcarcely elapſed, before the edicts publiſhed by the two weſtern emperors obliged Maximin to ſuſpend the proſecution of his deſigns: the civil war which he ſo raſhly undertook againſt Licinius employed all his attention; and the defeat and death of Maximin ſoon delivered the church from the laſt and moſt implacable of her enemies <note n="177" place="bottom">A few days before his death, he publiſhed a very ample edict of toleration, in which he imputes all the ſeverities which the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſuffered to the judges and governors, who had miſunderſtood his intentions.

            <p>In this general view of the perſecution, which <note place="margin">Probable account of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the martyrs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</note> was firſt authorized by the edicts of Diocletian, I have purpoſely refrained from deſcribing the particular ſufferings and deaths of the Chriſtian martyrs. It would have been an eaſy taſk, from the hiſtory of Euſebius, from the declamations of Lactantius, and from the moſt ancient acts, to collect a long ſeries of horrid and diſguſtful pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to fill many pages with racks and ſcourges, with iron hooks, and red hot beds, and with all the variety of tortures which fire and ſteel, ſavage beaſts and more ſavage executioners, could inflict on the human body. Theſe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſcenes might be enlivened by a crowd of viſions and miracles deſtined either to delay the death, to celebrate the triumph, or to diſcover the relics, of thoſe canonized ſaints who ſuffered for the name of Chriſt. But I cannot determine
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:0034700102:505"/>
what I ought to tranſcribe, till I am ſatisfied how much I ought to believe. The graveſt of the eccleſiaſtical hiſtorians, Euſebius himſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly confeſſes, that he has related whatever might redound to the glory, and that he has ſuppreſſed all that could tend to the diſgrace, of religion <note n="178" place="bottom">Such is the <hi>fair</hi> deduction from two remarkable paſſages in Euſebius, l. viii. c. 2. and de Martyr. Paleſtin. c. 12. The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the hiſtorian has expoſed his own character to cenſure and ſuſpicion. It was well known that he himſelf had been thrown into priſon; and it was ſuggeſted that he had purchaſed his deliverance by ſome diſhonourable compliance. The reproach was urged in his life-time, and even in his preſence, at the council of Tyre. See Tillemont, Memoires Eccleſiaſtiques, tom. viii. part i. p. 67.</note>. Such an acknowledgment will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally excite a ſuſpicion that a writer who has ſo openly violated one of the fundamental laws of hiſtory, has not paid a very ſtrict regard to the obſervance of the other: and the ſuſpicion will derive additional credit from the character of Euſebius, which was leſs tinctured with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, and more practiſed in the arts of courts, than that of almoſt any of his contemporaries. On ſome particular occaſions, when the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates were exaſperated by ſome perſonal motives of intereſt or reſentment, when the zeal of the martyrs urged them to forget the rules of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and perhaps of decency, to overturn the altars, to pour out imprecations againſt the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, or to ſtrike the judge as he ſat on his tribunal, it may be preſumed that every mode of torture, which cruelty could invent or conſtancy could endure, was exhauſted on thoſe devoted

Two circumſtances, however, have been unwarily mentioned, which inſinuate that the general treatment of the Chriſtians, who had been apprehended by the officers of juſtice, was leſs intolerable than it is uſually imagined to have been. 1. The confeſſors who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to work in the mines, were permitted, by the humanity or the negligence of their keepers, to build chapels, and freely to profeſs their religion in the midſt of thoſe dreary habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note n="180" place="bottom">Euſeb. de Martyr. Paleſtin. c. 13.</note>. 2. The biſhops were obliged to check and to cenſure the forward zeal of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who voluntarily threw themſelves into the hands of the magiſtrates. Some of theſe were perſons oppreſſed by poverty and debts, who blindly ſought to terminate a miſerable exiſtence by a glorious death. Others were allured by the hope, that a ſhort confinement would expiate the ſins of a whole life; and others again were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the leſs honourable motive of deriving a plentiful ſubſiſtence, and perhaps a conſiderable profit, from the alms which the charity of the faithful beſtowed on the priſoners <note n="181" place="bottom">Auguſtin.

church had triumphed over all her enemies, the intereſt as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the merit of their reſpective ſuffering. A convenient diſtance of time or place gave an ample ſcope to the progreſs of fiction; and the frequent inſtances which might be alleged of holy martyrs, whoſe wounds had been inſtantly healed, whoſe ſtrength had been renewed, and whoſe loſt members had miraculouſly been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, were extremely convenient for the purpoſe of removing every difficulty, and of ſilencing every objection. The moſt extravagant legends, as they conduced to the honour of the church, were applauded by the credulous multitude, countenanced by the power of the clergy, and atteſted by the ſuſpicious evidence of eccleſiaſtical hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The vague deſcriptions of exile and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Number of martyrs.</note> of pain and torture, are ſo eaſily exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated or ſoftened by the pencil of an artful orator, that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact of a more diſtinct and ſtubborn kind; the number of perſons who ſuffered death in conſequence of the edicts publiſhed by Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, his aſſociates, and his ſucceſſors. The recent legendaries record whole armies and cities, which were at once ſwept away by the undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing rage of perſecution.

ſeal with their blood their belief of the goſpel. From the hiſtory of Euſebius, it may however be collected, that only nine biſhops were puniſhed with death; and we are aſſured, by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Paleſtine, that no more than ninety-two Chriſtians were entitled to that honourable appellation <note n="182" place="bottom">Euſebius de Martyr.

The vth chapter of his viiith book, which relates to the province of Thebais in Egypt, may ſeem to contradict our moderate computation; but it will only lead us to admire the artful management of the hiſtorian. Chuſing for the ſcene of the moſt exquiſite cruelty, the moſt remote and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered country of the Roman empire, he relates, that in Thebais, from ten to one hundred perſons had frequently ſuffered martyrdom in the ſame day. But when he proceeds to mention his own jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into Egypt, his language inſenſibly becomes more cautious and moderate. Inſtead of a large, but definite number, he ſpeaks of many Chriſtians (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>); and moſt artfully ſelects two ambiguous words (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>), which may ſignify either what he had ſeen, or what he had heard; either the expectation, or the execution, of the puniſhment. Having thus provided a ſecure evaſion, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the equivocal paſſage to his readers and tranſlators; juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that their piety would induce them to prefer the moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſenſe. There was perhaps ſome malice in the remark of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Metochita, that all who, like Euſebius, had been converſant with the Egyptians, delighted in an obſcure and intricate ſtyle. (See Valeſius ad loc.)</note>. As we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the degree of epiſcopal zeal and courage which prevailed at that time, it is not in our power to draw any uſeful inferences from the former of theſe facts: but the latter may ſerve to juſtify a very important and probable concluſion. According to the diſtribution of Roman provinces, Paleſtine may be conſidered as the ſixteenth part of the Eaſtern empire <note n="183" place="bottom">When Paleſtine was divided into three, the praefecture of the Eaſt contained forty-eight provinces. As the ancient diſtinctions ofnations were long ſince aboliſhed, the Romans diſtributed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, according to a general proportion of their extent and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note>;

and ſince there were ſome governors, who from a real or affected clemency had preſerved their hands unſtained with the blood of the faithful <note n="184" place="bottom">Ut gloriari poſſint nullum ſe innocentium peremiſſe, nam et ipſe audivi aliquos gloriantes, quia adminiſtratio ſua, in hâc parte, fuerit incruenta. Lactant. Inſtitut. Divin. v. 11.</note>, it is reaſonable to believe, that the country which had given birth to Chriſtianity produced at leaſt the ſixteenth part of the martyrs who ſuffered death within the dominions of Galerius and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imin; the whole might conſequently amount to about fifteen hundred, a number which, if it is equally divided between the ten years of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, will allow an annual conſumption of one hundred and fifty martyrs. Allotting the ſame proportion to the provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where, at the end of two or three years, the rigour of the penal laws was either ſuſpended or aboliſhed, the multitude of Chriſtians in the Roman empire, on whom a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital puniſhment was inflicted by a judicial ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, will be reduced to ſomewhat leſs than two thouſand perſons. Since it cannot be doubted that the Chriſtians were more numerous, and their enemies more exaſperated, in the time of Diocletian than they had ever been in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer perſecution, this probable and moderate computation may teach us to eſtimate the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of primitive ſaints and martyrs who ſacrificed their lives for the important purpoſe of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Chriſtianity into the world.</p>

We ſhall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth, which obtrudes itſelf on the reluctant mind; that even admitting, without heſitation <note place="margin">Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> or enquiry, all that hiſtory has recorded, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion has feigned, on the ſubject of martyrdoms, it muſt ſtill be acknowledged, that the Chriſtians, in the courſe of their inteſtine diſſentions, have inflicted far greater ſeverities on each other, than they had experienced from the zeal of infidels. During the ages of ignorance which followed the ſubverſion of the Roman empire in the Weſt, the biſhops of the Imperial city extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of the Latin church. The fabric of ſuperſtition which they had erected, and which might long have defied the feeble efforts of reaſon, was at length aſſaulted by a crowd of daring fanatics, who, from the twelfth to the ſixteenth century, aſſumed the popular character of reformers. The church of Rome defended by violence the empire which ſhe had acquired by fraud; a ſyſtem of peace and benevolence was ſoon diſgraced by proſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wars, maſſacres, and the inſtitution of the holy office. And as the reformers were animated by the love of civil, as well as of religious freedom, the Catholic princes connected their own intereſt with that of the clergy, and enforced by fire and the ſword the terrors of ſpiritual cenſures. In the Netherlands alone, more than one hundred thouſand of the ſubjects of Charles the Fifth are ſaid to have ſuffered by the hand of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner; and this extraordinary number is atteſted

by Grotius <note n="185" place="bottom">Grot. Annal. de Rebus Belgicis, l. i. p. 12. Edit. fol.</note>, a man of genius and learning, who preſerved his moderation amidſt the fury of contending ſects, and who compoſed the annals of his own age and country, at a time when the invention of printing had facilitated the means of intelligence, and increaſed the danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. If we are obliged to ſubmit our belief to the authority of Grotius, it muſt be allowed, that the number of Proteſtants, who were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in a ſingle province and a ſingle reign, far exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the ſpace of three centuries, and of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But if the improbability of the fact itſelf ſhould prevail over the weight of evidence; if Grotius ſhould be convicted of exaggerating the merit and ſufferings of the Reformers <note n="186" place="bottom">Fra-Paolo (Iſtoria del Concilio Tridentino, l. iii.) reduces the number of Belgic martyrs to 50,000. In learning and moderation, Fra-Paolo was not inferior to Grotius. The priority of time gives ſome advantage to the evidence of the former, which he loſes on the other hand by the diſtance of Venice from the Netherlands.</note>; we ſhall be naturally led to inquire, what confidence can be placed in the doubtful and imperfect monuments of ancient credulity; what degree of credit can be aſſigned to a courtly biſhop, and a paſſionate declaimer, who, under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Conſtantine, enjoyed the excluſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of recording the perſecutions inflicted on the Chriſtians by the vanquiſhed rivals or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded predeceſſors of their gracious ſovereign.</p>
