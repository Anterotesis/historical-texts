            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Nunc aut Nunquam.</hi>

            <p>Then an Old Man, with a long Beard, clothed

            <p>Then a vaſt Mob, hollowing, hooping and

            <p>In this Order he was conducted to his Inn,

met, and Congratulated by the Monkeys in
their Formalities. They entreated him to tarry
ſome time with them; but he declined it, and
purſued his Journey to the next Corporation;
for, you muſt know, he expects the ſame Honours
to be paid him where-ever he goes; which (how
ſtrange ſoever it may ſeem to ſome) is no new
thing; for he's not the firſt that has been waited
on by a Corporation in their Robes; for in the
Reign of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> a Fellow, who wore his Hat
button'd up on one ſide, and a Feather therein,
like a Tooth-drawer, with a Roſe and Crown
on his Breaſt for a Badge, got a Licenſe to make
a Show of a great <hi>APE</hi> about the Country:
And coming to a certain Town, [☞Whether
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1100800900:6"/>
               <hi>Banbury,</hi> or not, I can't tell] they beat a Drum
about to give Notice, That there was a very
witty Ape to be ſeen; but the Towns-People,
being poor, thought it not worth their while
to ſee this ſight; upon which the Fellow was
enraged, and was reſolved to put a Trick upon
them; and thereupon ſends the following War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to the Worſhipful the Mayor.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">THeſe are to Require you, and every one
of you, with your Wives and Families,
(upon ſight hereof) to make your perſonal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
before the Queen's Ape, who is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Rank and Quality, and of vaſt Parts, he
having been bred at an Univerſity; and is to
viſit moſt Parts of the Kingdom, that by his
Converſation with the Queen's Subjects, he may
be the better enabled to diſcover their Fidelity and
Loyalty. Hereof fail not at your Peril.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When Mr. Mayor had open'd the Warrant, he
(who always did what he pleas'd) holds it topſie
turvy, and after ſome thoughts thereon, ſends
his Maid to the further end of the Town, for a
Shoemaker to come and read it. When he heard
the Contents, he ſummon'd his Brethren the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
to the Town-Hall, to conſult of this
weighty Affair; where they ſat looking on one
another for ſome time, not knowing what to
ſay: At length the youngeſt Alderman, ſtanding
up, ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen, If I may ſpeak without Offence,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1100800900:7"/>
               <hi>I'll give you my Opinion in this Matter. — Speak on,</hi>
ſays Mr. Mayor, <hi>for though you are but a young Officer,
you may ſpeak as much Senſe as any of us. — Well
then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my humble Opinion is, That this Ape-Fellow
is a ſawcy Knave, and only deſigns to make our Town
ridiculous: For was it ever known, that a Warrant ſhould
be ſent, without either Name or Date, to a Mayor of a
Town, who is the Queen's Lieutenant; and that he, and his
Brethren, their Wives and Children, ſhould be commanded
to appear before a</hi> Jackanapes? <hi>My Council is therefore,
That you take him and his Ape, and whip the whole Tribe
out of Town, which will be much to your Credit and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The Words were ſcarce ſpoke, e're a grave Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
reply'd, <hi>Hold, Friend, you have ſpoke little leſs
than Treaſon; Remember 'tis the Queen's Ape. — True,
Brother,</hi> quoth the Mayor, <hi>therefore it behoves us to take
care what we ſay in this troubleſom Buſineſs. — Marry,</hi>
ſays another grave Senior, <hi>we may ſee by the Feather in
his Cap, and the Badge he wears, that he is the Queen's
Man; and who knows what an Injury he may do us poor
Men in the Country for contemning the Warrant? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us e'ne go and ſee the Ape; 'tis but</hi> 2 d. <hi>apiece, and

Speech the Aſſembly reſolved to pay the Ape a Viſit,
and ordered the Town-Clerk to acquaint the Queen's
Man therewith.</p>
            <p>Next Day the Mayor and Aldermen in their Robes,
(<hi>the Serjeant carrying the Mace before them, their Recorder
being at the Head of them</hi>) with whole Droves of

               </gap>,
and made a Mouth. — <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

the Mayor, <hi>I ſee thy ſawcineſs, and I'll make thee to know
that the Woman, whom thou mockeſt, is my Wife, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Woman, and a Midwife, and one who is old enough
to be thy Mother.</hi> And thereupon going to his Tutor,
<hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>do you allow your Ape to abuſe my Wife? — 
No,</hi> quoth he. — <hi>Truly,</hi> ſays the Mayor, <hi>there's ſufficient
witneſs that ſaw him make Mops and Mows at her.</hi> — The
Tutor thereupon gave poor <hi>Pug</hi> half a Dozen ſmart
Laſhes with his Whip, which made his Teeth chatter;
upon which Mr. <hi>Mayor</hi> cried out, <hi>Enough, Enough:
Good Sir, you have done like a Gentleman: I deſire you
never to give Correction any more in your Wrath: And when
the Play is done, be pleaſed to come along with your Ape to
our Town-Hall, both of you to take a ſmall Supper with me,
and the reſt of my Brethren the Aldermen.</hi>

            <p>But to return to our Champion: After he had viſited
ſeveral Corporations, and given Audience to the Mob,
(who were wonderfully taken with this new Raree-Show)

give Notice of his coming. — The Bells immediately
rung for Joy: — But that avail'd him nothing; for the
Monkeys did not appear in their Robes! which was a
great Mortification to him, and thoſe of his Faction.
However, he was met by 10 or 12 ſtiff Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> on
Sorrel Nags, attended by a few Butchers and Barbers,
who made a Purſe, and bought Two Hogſheads of Ale,
which were ſet in the Publick Street, where the Rabble
got ſhamefully drunk in Toaſting a Health to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
