            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A Work which is in the world, under the title of the PUPIL OF PLEASURE, exemplified that part of a <hi>late celebrated ſyſtem,</hi> which led im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to voluptuouſneſs, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, and ſeduction. It was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a faint mark for literary ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule. The peculiar ſucceſs of my
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0147101501:5"/>undertaking, and the general eſteem it ſtill maintains, (notwithſtanding the wilful, or the ignorant, perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a few individuals, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to have their ſcruples concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the character of <hi>Sedley)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, that I did not write in vain.</p>
            <p>But, methinks, ſomething very eſſential yet remains to be done. There is a much <hi>better,</hi> as well as a much more <hi>brilliant, ſyſtem</hi> ſtill to be illuſtrated; the ſyſtem of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and TRUTH.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0147101501:6"/>
This is attempted in the <hi>preſent</hi> performance, where the reader will ſee, in contraſt to the <hi>Pupil of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> a character of a very different colouring figure before him. One, who, though even more accompliſhed than SEDLEY, with all his fire, ſpirit and opportunity, as well as every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal advantage, employs each in the cauſe, not of ruin, but <hi>ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been endeavoured alſo, that the ſcenes, in which this new per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage is engaged, ſhould be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as to give full ſcope for all that is juſt, affecting and ennobled,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0147101501:7"/>without departing from human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Hero of <hi>this</hi> production, like that of the <hi>other,</hi> hath many ſtruggles, and many anxieties; for virtue (with reſpect to <hi>ordinary</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and rewards) is not always for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: but between the two heroes there is, throughout their adventures, this diſtinguiſhing difference; the one hath the pangs of <hi>remorſe</hi> ſuperadded to thoſe of ſhame and deſpair; and the ſufferings of the other, like the agonies of a Meſſiah, are always for the truth, and for the happineſs of others. All that the beſt men in the world can ſay to themſelves
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0147101501:8"/>is comprized in this couplet of the poet.</p>
            <q>
               <l>'Tis not in mortals to <hi>command</hi> ſucceſs,</l>
               <l>But we'll do <hi>more,</hi> Sempronius, we'll <hi>deſerve</hi> it.</l>
            </q>
            <p>There have been thoſe (whether in the ſpirit of criticiſm, or from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, I cannot tell) who have warned the young and ſober againſt the <hi>warmth of character</hi> in the <hi>Pupil of Pleaſure:</hi> ſurely, a little thinking might reconcile to <hi>them,</hi> (as to the reſt of the world) the propriety of painting vice in ſtrong colours, in order to bring it into contempt. That very SEDLEY, who ſets out, with all the graces of <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> in
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0147101501:9"/>his train, ſoon loſes his credit with the reader; he fades, towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, more and more in every page; and at laſt, he becomes a deſperate, deteſted man, on whoſe grave even Pity herſelf can ſcarce be prevailed on to ſhed a tear.</p>
            <p>If, however, this objection, in the breaſt of any one, ſtill ſubſiſts againſt me, it would be a piece of juſtice not unworthy the <hi>true</hi> critic, if he would take upon him to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the character of <hi>Captain Carliſle</hi> in this work, as officiouſly as he has diſcommended that of Mr. SEDLEY,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0147101501:10"/>in the other. In real fact, SEDLEY is the <hi>ſhade</hi> which will ſet CARLISLE in the proper <hi>light;</hi> and, although the <hi>ſtories</hi> through which I have conveyed the moral, are utterly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, yet thoſe, who are candid enough to conceive a book of this kind may be made <hi>ſyſtematic,</hi> and who may read the two performances <hi>together,</hi> will, I flatter myſelf, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a connexion (with regard to ſyſtem) not wholly inappoſite.</p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>Sedley</hi> is a monſter, and <hi>Carliſle</hi> is a man. Let them be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately compared, and read only
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0147101501:11"/>with this view, whenever they are in the hands of the young. As SEDLEY is the object of eſcape and abhorrence; CARLISLE is that of intimacy and imitation. He is much embarraſſed, but he has ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to bear him up: he is purpoſely plunged in difficulty, that his <hi>truth</hi> might be the more tried; and that, <hi>being</hi> tried, it might, like fine gold from the fire, come forth the purer. He is <hi>Sedley</hi>'s oppoſite in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, except the attractions of form (which were given to SEDLEY alſo only to render <hi>Cheſterfieldiſm</hi> more exact). CARLISLE protects the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0147101501:12"/>that he might have deſtroyed; he ſpares the chaſtity that he might have violated; he endeavours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the wife, whom he might have ruined: he has all the policy of prudence, without deviating from <hi>truth:</hi> he is graced with every poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ornament of character: inſtead of <hi>corrupting,</hi> he <hi>enriches</hi> ſociety.</p>
            <p>That the hero of the preſent work might have every <hi>ultimate</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſo as to bring the <hi>moral</hi> which his adventures convey, more forcibly home to the buſineſs and boſom of the reader, he appears, at
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0147101501:13"/>different times, in all the amiable <hi>lights</hi> of which his picture is ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Amongſt theſe, the honour of his friendſhips, the tenderneſſes of his love, the delicacy of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, his diſcretion under embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his courage in exigencies, will not eſcape the attentive reader. It ſhould be noted, alſo, that the contraſt of the preſent, with the former performance, receives ſtill greater force, by the introduction of other ſketches which will be found here; particularly the ſhort ſcenes that belong to Mr. <hi>Henry Hewſon,</hi> and his brother. Theſe
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0147101501:14"/>characters are interwoven, not ſo much to enliven, and relieve the deepneſs of the pathetic in the other parts, as to give greater elucidation to the <hi>ſyſtem.</hi> With the like view, the characters of the fighting <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and the fearful, frolickſome Sir <hi>Andrew Flight,</hi> have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as have thoſe of Mr. <hi>Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi> the <hi>Marchioneſs of N</hi>***, and <hi>Lucia De Grey.</hi> It is hoped, theſe all promote the moral as much as they contribute to the intereſts of the fable: for example, <hi>Sedley,</hi> the Pupil of Pleaſure, was uniformly vicious, deceitful, and reprobate,
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0147101501:15"/>and therefore <hi>died.</hi> Captain <hi>Carliſle,</hi> the Tutor of Truth, is invariably juſt, ingenuous, and good, and therefore <hi>lives. Sedley</hi> often felt the ſtroke of ill ſucceſs, but conſoled himſelf in the worſt of times with the hope of accompliſhing his wicked wiſhes at laſt. <hi>Carliſle</hi> is ſenſible of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too, but is kept from paroxiſms of deſpair by a ſilent appeal to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>Laſcelles</hi> is at once rakiſh, falſe, diſſolute, and therefore meets with puniſhment. The <hi>Marchioneſs of N</hi>***, though pitiable, is alſo an object of terror to be held up to the female world, ſince the ſame imprudence will naturally lead to the
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0147101501:16"/>ſame mi-fortunes. The Earl and Counteſs of <hi>Bleſſingbourne</hi> are brought into this work, to ſhew, that, <hi>true politeneſs</hi> and <hi>the Graces,</hi> are charms independent of mere rank, titles, or eſtate: the family of the <hi>Hewſons</hi> are here, to prove, that, <hi>true politeneſs</hi> and the <hi>Graces</hi> are not to be bought, as mere marketable commodities, whenever a man happens to have money to ſpare; and to prove like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that neither ruſtic manners on the one hand, nor bookiſh pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on the other, will enable men to leave the farm-houſe and the cloyſter to figure, more reſpectably, in a ſtate
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0147101501:17"/>of refinement. In full oppoſition to <hi>

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0147101501:24"/>at certain turns in your epiſtle. There are ſome few words in your favour miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpelled: for inſtance; the words <hi>caſſion, preachment, magines, corpſeſſes,</hi> &amp;c. have not yet come under thoſe eyes which have, from firſt to laſt, dipt into twenty thouſand compoſitions. Neither is your epitaph devoid of inaccuracies: there being neither pathos in your poetry, nor chaſtity in your rhyme, all which is abſolutely neceſſary to the preſent times. <hi>No ſon</hi> does not echo very melodiouſly to <hi>Hewſon: daughter</hi> and <hi>ater</hi> might be improved: <hi>kin</hi> and <hi>ſkin</hi> are ſo very near, my dear HENRY, that they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſeem one fleſh; their <hi>ſounds</hi> are too ſimilar: <hi>reſpect</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> may do: but <hi>ſlab</hi> and <hi>Gab</hi> are the moſt prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous words that ever terminated in the way of verſe, ſince rhyming began: nor is a tombſtone, with any propriety, called a marble ſlab.—No, HARRY,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0147101501:25"/>no—your meaning is, as it ought to be; but, for your poetry, the leſs you have to do with the Muſes the better: at leaſt wait a little till my dictionary comes out, and then if you have but a ray of Apollo, it will have it out of you; for I will take on me to ſay no work extant, that <hi>is,</hi> or that <hi>ſhall</hi> be, will give a man ſuch a knack, or kindle in him ſuch a <hi>furor Phoebi,</hi> as I may call it, as my dictionary.</p>

And pray, wiſe Sir, who is obliged to underſtand your grecum, latinum lingo, do you think? <hi>I</hi> was not cramb'd with ſuch conundrums when I was young, and I <hi>ant</hi> ſorry for it, now I'm turn'd of thirty.</p>
               <p>With regard to the anſwer you have made me, 'tis no anſwer at all: inſtead

And as to your <hi>dictionary,</hi> it may go, for HARRY. To cut the matter ſhort, brother, I wrote you a very civil, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable letter, and in return, you have ſent me a <hi>cuſſed</hi> thing of which I can make neither head nor tail, only I can ſee plain enough that you think yourſelf a very clever fellow, and I no wiſer than I ſhould be: for that matter, GAB, none of your family were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurors, and I don't believe you are the <hi>ſenfibleſt</hi> o'um neither.

               <p>THE pleaſure I expected in your company this ſeaſon at Helter Skelter Hall muſt, of neceſſity, be poſtponed till the ſummer following. Every thing is at ſixes and ſevens; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, the large addition to my fortune makes it very improper I ſhould ſee my friends in the <hi>hugger-mugger</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I did, while I was as poor as my neighbours. I have poſitively found out, my dear DE GREY, that there is not a ſingle room in this up and down old manſion fit to ſit in, much leſs to receive
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0147101501:38"/>the moſt delicate of her ſex. But ſince I am deprived of the pleaſure I expected in having you with me, as uſual, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to commence a correſpondence with you, that I may tell you from time to time how we go on in thoſe alterations that I am reſolved immediately to make. I deſign to fit up the ſweeteſt retreat in the univerſe, your father's not excepted —I ſay <hi>retreat,</hi> becauſe I ſhall occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally retreat to it: for, I certainly ſhall not paſs my winters for the future out of Pall-Mall (<hi>that</hi> is, I think I have heard you ſay, the beſt quarter of the town) beſides its having the double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of being the winter reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Miſs DE GREY.</p>
               <p>Juſt as I writ your name, I happened to look at the chimney-piece, and I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely thought it had undergone a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect change within this week; as, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0147101501:39"/>in my opinion, hath every thing about the houſe. I cannot look at an object in the hall or the great garden that does not diſguſt me. Heaven have mercy on me! how they wanted taſte in building formerly! Such huge, horrid, outward doors, ſtudded with ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous nobs of non; ſuch dreadful arches to every entrance, like the porches of ugly ſtone-work before a church; ſuch corners, lanes, entries, and alleys, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like laby rinths through every room: the fire-places ſo large, the windows ſo little, the glaſs of them ſo diminutive, the wainſcotings ſo figured, the beams ſo bulky, and the paſſages ſo dark and dirty, that they ſeem built rather to be the dens for beaſts of prey, than for ſuch harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs little creatures as men and women. Then the gardens are as hideous as the habitations: only to think, LUCIA, of a <hi>con-ſumed</hi> great mote, divided only by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0147101501:40"/>a naſty drawbridge, running quite round the manſion, moſt gloriouſly cropped with duck-weed, and inviting all the fowls of the air to flap their wings and feed about us, to the great annoyance of ſleep and every other comfort. Add to this, the gardens <hi>themſelves</hi>—I am now lifting up my head from the vulgar old table on which I am writing, and I am taking—I declare to you, almoſt with tears in my eyes—a view of our precious platform. I behold in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect about three acres of ground, as completely murdered in the diſpoſition, as a modern gardener could wiſh: eight-and-twenty yew-trees, interſperſed with an equal number of boxes and hollies, riſe before me, to whoſe flouriſhing ſhades I am to attribute half the vermin that ſwarm like a peſtilence about us. Let not the abominable walls that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round our dwelling and its environs, be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0147101501:41"/>forgotten; high above all height; brown above every thing embrowned.—But I have not patience to proceed. And ſhall I invite the lovely LUCIA to this Gothic ſcene? No, LUCIA, no; now that kind Fortune hath put it into my power, I will level with the duſt this ruinous pile of building, and raiſe up in its ſtead ſo different a ſtructure, that the very ground ſhall thank me for <hi>dreſſing it out</hi> ſo charmingly. The moment I have compleated my deſign you ſhall come and confeſs I have a reliſh for improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I have, this moment, the exact image of my intentions. Where there are now mountains, will I make vallies; where there are at preſent crops of nettles, or vulgar flowers that are to me worſe than nettles, will I ſet rows of lillies and beds of roſes; roſes I mean of <hi>moſs,</hi> that ſcarce burſt forth from the bearded bud, elegant, ſmall, odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0147101501:42"/>and not ſuch flaring, flaſhing, old-faſhioned things, as figure away in our garden, that look as if the ſeeds were ſown and the trees planted imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the fall; juſt when all the beautiful in Nature firſt felt the curſe upon it. As to the yew-trees, I will not leave one of them alive, no not even that which is cut into the form of a ſugar-loaf; and, ſo inveterate is my vengeance in regard to theſe, that I will, yea even after they are fell'd— make the infected wretches perform quarantine at a mile's diſtance, in open air, before I will allow them the honour of being <hi>burned</hi> in my preſence: as to my old friend the <hi>mote,</hi> with whom I have exchanged watry looks, ever ſince I ſaw him, I will cauſe all his channels to be dried up, and <hi>terra firma,</hi> as brother GAB calls it, to flouriſh about him. The drawbridge will I alſo remove; and, to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0147101501:43"/>ſhew my diſlike and ridicule of ſuch an antique, I will ſubſtitute, by way of mockery and the mode, an ha! ha! in his ſtead. Neither ſhall any part of our <hi>houſe furniture</hi> fare better, for there ſhall be a general <hi>clearance.</hi> Stags heads ſhall give place to Hogarth's prints: family pictures, notwithſtanding the large ruffs on my grandmother's neck, the whiſkers on my great uncle's upper lip, and the profuſion of chitterlin on my god-papa's boſom, muſt all yield to politer decorations.—In ſhort, I will create a paradiſe about me, and that without delay. In the mean time, I will <hi>commence</hi> the woman of faſhion, by giving orders never to be ſeen by any body but tradeſmen, till I am all <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights</hi>—not even by LUCIA DE GREY. How I ſhall bring Mr. HEWSON over to this genteel way of thinking, I don't know; particularly as he is not, you
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0147101501:44"/>know, the beſt bred man in the world. However, done it muſt be—that's flat; for I cannot breathe any longer in ſuch a place! Oh Heavens, how have I breath'd ſo long! It is equally an affront to my perſon, my underſtanding, and my fortune! If any little ornaments ſtrike <hi>you,</hi> that may aſſiſt my ſcheme of embelliſhing, pray think of them in your next. I deſign to call one of my new rooms <hi>Lucia</hi>'s <hi>Saloon.</hi> Pray, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let LUCIA's fancy aſſiſt me in fitting it up.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0147101501:47"/>ramifications</hi> ſpread, the <hi>ſublime of darkneſs viſible</hi> over my cottage, gave ſuch a <hi>ſet-off</hi> to my ſtudy, that I was abſolutely the hero of an hermitage. I ſat and read, till I fancied myſelf, in <hi>the fervor of the intellectual feelings,</hi> a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher in the ſhades. In the dim hour of evening I uſed to be the companion of the ſooty-pinioned bat, and walked forth to meditate on the readings I had made in the day. I rejoiced in the name that the people of the village gave me, and I had a ſecret pride in ſeeing them in the twilight, ſtealing a look at the learned gentleman in the dark houſe i'th' midſt of Sombre Hedges. I was juſt lighting up my lamp, and ſetting down to a chapter of Cicero, with Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malkin by my ſide, when news of my new honours, broke like too mighty a flood of light, upon the ſerenity of my darkneſs. I was dazzled, and knew
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0147101501:48"/>not what to do. For want of habitude, wealth, like a robe firſt put on, and made <hi>not conſonant to our uſual faſhion,</hi> ſat uneaſy upon me. As my ſoul was not fitted to my fortune, neither was my fortune fitted to my ſoul. I hit upon a paſſage, where Tully, the prince of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian eloquence, recommended an equal mind in all revolutions; an hour <hi>before,</hi> I ſhould have given to the very printed page an holy kiſs of approbation, but, at preſent, it was no ſuch matter:—I was now to conſider myſelf as maſter of ten thouſand pounds, and I was taken ſo unawares that I trimmed my lamp in order to ſee the <hi>will</hi> clearer; and when I had the misfortune to find the thing was <hi>certain,</hi> I was much agitated, and crept at length into the cloſet, which contained the wholeſome bed of a ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, upon the ſurface of which I laid
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0147101501:49"/>down, with a heart that throbbed, and a head that ach'd till the morning.</p>
               <p>I roſe early, brother, but not to my accuſtomed ſatisfaction, for I found my feelings were altered. Thoſe ſmall, but dear attentions, which the day before belonged to an eſtate of 60<hi>l. per</hi> year, were over. I could not any longer think I was the proprietor of a ſnug box, when the load of ten thouſand pounds ſell abruptly upon my ſhoulders in the lump. I never looked into a book that whole day, and to ſay truth, I hardly thought there was a <hi>cover</hi> in my ſtudy fit to come into the hand of a man of fortune. Was it not ſome Demon, think you, that put it into my head to take down, three days after, the only <hi>coxcomb</hi> volume in my whole library? and the ſcope of this was to recommend taſte, elegance, faſhion, and commerce
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0147101501:50"/>with men, on purpoſe to give a finiſhing to the man of ſpeculation. With an avidity for which I deſpiſe myſelf, did I peruſe this work quite through, and from that moment I became a prophane, excentric, diſſipated fellow. I ſaid unto the woodman, Fell me thoſe horrid trees that hide me from <hi>the blooming face of Phoebus;</hi> down inſtantly with theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darkneſs, that there may be light. I am aſhamed to tell you, that I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my windows to be cleaned; yea, even the little lattice that emitted ſcarce half a ſun-beam into my library, and which was almoſt vegetable with the over-growth of ivy, did I order to be laid bare to all the ſplendors of day— Why ſhould I conceal the moſt <hi>egregious</hi> of my follies? I have at this minute two artificers in my houſe, and perhaps the paſſion may gain ſuch ſway in a few hours, that, by to-morrow, the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0147101501:51"/>of the building may not be ſuffered to ſtand. I am already <hi>not</hi> the dark gentleman of Sombre Hedges, but the poor fellow who hath, like a ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the winter, emerged unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably from his corner, to blind himſelf with light. Upon the whole, my heart, like my houſe, is totally diſarranged. I pray Heaven, <hi>yours</hi> may be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and I hope to hear, that your hopes and happineſs ſtand juſt where they did, before the death of our kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man HEIDEDGER.</p>

               <head>In anſwer.</head>
               <p>I LIKE you ten times better than ever; for I finds <hi>you</hi> are as much altered as <hi>I</hi> am. There never was a more miſerable dog than either of us. I dare not ſay this <hi>before,</hi> for fear you ſhould laugh at me; but now, that I find you are as ſtrange a fellow as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I tell you, without farther <hi>permable,</hi> that I hant ſhot a partridge <hi>this</hi> three weeks, and my dogs are yelping in the kennel for freſh air and their ſport. People now give me ſo much <hi>joy</hi> when I go about, that I am quite
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0147101501:53"/>miſerable. My wife HETTY, too, has been <hi>at</hi> me about <hi>pliteneſs,</hi> and bids me look in the glaſs to ſee if it is not a ſin and a ſhame, for ſuch a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> man as I to go ſuch a figure, and ſhut myſelf up in an old timber houſe among hounds and horſes, guns and game traps. She ſays I ſhould be a very <hi>ſightly</hi> man, if beard was ſmoothed oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ruffles put on wriſt-bands, after the faſhion of young Captain CARLISLE. She ſays, too, we might now alter our courſe of life, and live upon our wealth like Mr. and Mrs. Somebody, in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent gueſs place than Helter Skelter Hall. Upon this I clapt me on a clean ſhirt, and a pair of ſilken ſtockings, after I had doft leathern hunting breeches; and, without <hi>ſhamming,</hi> I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought, what with the powder in my hair, and ribbon behind in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knot, not forgetting black crevat,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0147101501:54"/>which the jade tied ſo as to make me look—I don't know how—I was one of your <hi>bettermoſt</hi> perſons. As I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the large hall thus <hi>quipp'd,</hi> old Daſhgrove, the ſetting bitch, barked at me, as if ſhe did not known Maſter HENRY thro' his finery, upon which I lent her a <hi>douze,</hi> to teach her how to behave to man of <hi>pliteneſs:</hi> after this, Tippler the ſpaniel came and fawn'd on me, leaving the track of her paws on my ſilken ſtockings, upon which I fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured her alſo with ſuch a <hi>flick</hi> that the poor thing howled for a quarter of an hour. In ſhort, I can't help ſpeaking <hi>haſh,</hi> and taking a little upon me, more than uſual: and this was partly the <hi>caſion</hi> of my writing you ſuch a rough letter; for, I finds I am grown deviliſh <hi>touchey,</hi> ſince I <hi>came</hi> to be a great man; and SUSAN, the maid, ſays, I am not like to be much the <hi>better</hi> for my riches;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0147101501:55"/>ſeeing, that I have got <hi>them,</hi> and loſt my good-nature. I am moſt conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly troubled to know <hi>what to do;</hi> and, mayhap, <hi>that</hi> makes me growl more than I otherwiſe ſhould. Sometimes I think of giving up my farm at Skelter, ſometimes of buying racing horſes; ſometimes of making myſelf <hi>cuſſed</hi> gay in the <hi>pareil</hi> way; ſometimes I have a mind to <hi>crackle</hi> it away in a coach; ſometimes to put worſted of different colours on JOE JOBSON's coat, and clap a <hi>cue</hi> to his head—But then again I can't help telling HETTY, this would be damn'd nonſenſe for a <hi>feller</hi> like I, who have as good a pair of legs as ever worked under a man, and who has gone rough as he run <hi>this</hi> many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But for all that, if we could, when he comes from <hi>broad</hi> (which is to be ſoon) get <hi>into's</hi> company now and then, and take notice how he carries himſelf, how he talks, opens his lips, and the like, I don't doubt but we could make ourſelves no ſmall fools, in the

               <p>To live thus, is out of the queſtion, ſo pray think of mending the matter. HETTY is airing me another ruffled ſhirt, and ſays, I muſt ſhift every day now I am a man of property. The linen is rare and hot, ſo I muſt ene put it on; have only time, therefore, to ſay, that</p>

               <p>I AM in the moſt diſtreſſing ſtate of mind in the world—the Lady of the Marquis of N. with whom I was on friendly terms in Italy, hath very inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently, and under colour of an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which I never before diſcovered) followed me to England. To my utter aſtoniſhment ſhe is now before me, too beautiful to be denied protection; and yet, in a ſituation, on all hands too ſacred for me long to beſtow it. She
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0147101501:62"/>ſet off in a packet that ſailed, it ſeems, at the ſame time mine did. She is in the habit of a boy: her huſband doats upon her. She looks with the brighteſt eyes into my face, while, with the moſt perſuading voice, ſhe tells me, ſhe is in a ſtrange land, where ſhe knows not a ſingle friend. What is to be done? She came in upon me, juſt after I had ſent Mr. DE GREY's letter to the poſt, ſo that it cannot be recalled, and truth requires my promiſes ſhould be fulfilled —But the Lady muſt be, ſome way, accommodated, at leaſt, till ſhe can be perſuaded to return to the Marquis.</p>
               <p>To <hi>your</hi> care, therefore, I commit her for a little time, and I ſhall, in the evening, when I have reconciled her to this mode, bring the fair fugitive to your houſe, where, in the mean time, you will prepare your ſiſter, to receive

               <p>I WRITE this to my dear LASCELLES, with a hand that trembles for the ſituation of your fair charge. She diſcovered, methought, as I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her to you, an impatience of temper that may be fatal. She talks of her huſband with an ardour of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I believe it is impoſſible ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed a man ſhould have deſerved. I feel a compunction, not very unlike reproach, at being obliged to refuſe her my addreſs. Do you not agree with me, that ſtrong marks of diſapprobation
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0147101501:65"/>were painted in her countenance, when I obſerved, that all her ſentiments would reach me by incloſing them, either ſealed or unſealed, to you? I did propoſe to have ſet out this day for Mr. DE GREY's, but I muſt apologize for a little delay, becauſe I judge it beſt to ſee how ſhe ſettles with your family, and to write to the Marquis before I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the country, where I had flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my imagination with enjoying the moſt uninterrupted happineſs. As ſhe is a native of England, you know, it is poſſible you may, by ſome means, trace out her relations, ſome of whom are, as I have been informed, in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and yet, till we have the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's anſwer, it may perhaps be a more <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate</hi> piece of integrity to keep the matter out of every body's mouth, but the worthy family to whom it was neceſſary to entruſt it. On ſecond thoughts, therefore, I beg
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0147101501:66"/>matter may reſt where it is, in your faithful boſom, and in that of Miſs LASCELLES. In the mean time, if AUGUSTA remains prudent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the whole indiſcretion may be done away: every thing may be huſhed, and the Marquis be again made happy, without the confuſion of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated by people, who turn acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents into table-talk. For my <hi>own</hi> part, I dare ſay, it will be eaſy for me to convince the huſband that I dealt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably. At beſt, the dilemma is very diſpleaſing, and the only way leſt, is to act in it, and to ſtruggle through it, as becomes a man of prudence and principle.</p>

               <p>I FOLLOWED him, my VIOLA. I practiſed to the very utmoſt, my more than romantic reſolution—I eluded even the vigilance of the Marquis—I never loſt ſight of the exquiſite CARLISLE—I ſurmounted every fatigue—I paſſed every where, as a beardleſs youth of the Italian ſoil; and I am now returned to thoſe ſhores from whence I drew my firſt breath, and from whence I was ſo early carried to that part of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where he who is now my huſband firſt ſaw me.</p>
               <p>

Yes, VIOLA, I am here—I am in London.—I am within a ſhort mile of the houſe of CARLISLE.—But, alas! to what purpoſe? My paſſion is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; my mode of gratifying it has been irregular—I bluſh at my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—but I am ſtill weak enough to love—to love, Viola, with a fervor that is equally my ſhame and my agony. Yet, I propoſe only to be within his view—a ſight of him—a touch of his hand—his converſation—his ſmile.— Theſe were my ambition: violent as I am, I tell you the extent of my guilt— But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſe are already denied me. He has left me in charge of his friends, who are brother and ſiſter—they treat my misfortune with tenderneſs—the ſiſter ſpeaks warmly of Mr. CARLISLE's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. I perceive that the words <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> attachment are favourites—Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, VIOLA! perhaps ſhe is—yet that's
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0147101501:69"/>not likely—I will not have it ſo. I could not bear it. At a village on the borders of Italy, my ſpeed brought me near enough to ſee him ſalute a female acquaintance; and though modeſty and reaſon, all concurred to ſanctify the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, yet I wanted dignity enough in my nature, to reſtrain the execration which I uttered againſt her beauty. No, no, it is ſome comfort yet (even were I never more to behold him, which would kill me)—it is ſome comfort yet, that his heart is without other attachments.</p>
               <p>My condition calls for ten thouſand comforts, and I foreſee, not <hi>one</hi> will be allowed me—I have numberleſs circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to tell you, but I want eaſe and compoſure to write. The Marquis has, I ſuppoſe, left Rome in a rage. For the firſt time in my life, although I have long deſpiſed him, have I taken
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0147101501:70"/>advantage of his confidence, but it was only to eſcape from the object of my averſion to that of my fondneſs—of my adoration.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the Marquis may ſuſpect every thing I was ſo cautious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal. If ſo, my dear CARLISLE is in danger. I am not ignorant of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's temper. I have <hi>felt</hi> its violence —He ſtruck me, VIOLA; the villain in his meanneſs ſtruck me! I never ſhall either forget or forgive it.</p>
               <p>CARLISLE in danger!—In danger!— for what—for his unparallelled <hi>integrity</hi> —for his dignity—for his <hi>truth?</hi> Ah, Signora, were he the moſt guilty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being the moſt innocent, of men, my romantic ſoul would take fire at the proſpect of his peril, and ſet life, fame, hope, and Heaven itſelf, at a

               </opener>
               <p>WERE it not that your ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation called rather for condolence than mirth, I could acquaint you, in very jocular language, of a circumſtance that carries with it the air of an adventure in the days of chivalry.</p>
               <p>The heroine, or rather the lady-errant of this enterprize, is your AUGUSTA, who, taking advantage of your journey
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0147101501:77"/>about the time of my departure, was reſolved to be even with you for the anxieties of ſeparation, and ſo paid you <hi>in kind</hi> by taking a trip to England. I dare ſay ſhe intended, at firſt, only to amuſe herſelf with a ſhort excurſion to deceive the time till your return: but the ſpirited creature, with all that ardor which, you know, belongs to her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, laid her plan of operation in ſuch a manner, that, when ſhe was once em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, it was abſolutely impoſſible to retreat. She contrived the matter ſo as to paſs upon every body for an Italian ſtripling travelling to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, properly equipped for the opera houſe: the better to ſupport which, ſhe was provided with ſuitable habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments, and above all, a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind of head-dreſs, that maſked her from every thing but the moſt critical inſpection. It will demand all your
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0147101501:78"/>beſt opinion of my veracity, to credit me when I proteſt to you, that ſhe eſcaped <hi>my</hi> notice through the whole journey, nor was I acquainted with any part of the circumſtance till, in compleating the project, ſhe diſcovered herſelf to me in my own apartments in London. It was not for <hi>me</hi> to upbraid her upon the principle of the pain you was ſuffering; nor was it proper ſhe ſhould remain with one, who has not the honour to be in the married ſtate. I therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to be as eaſy as her reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would allow, at the houſe of a particular friend of mine, who has a ſiſter that will preſerve her ſafe, till ſhe is once more in the arms of her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis. The ſtep ſhe has taken was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly carrying the joke too far, and, no doubt, ſhe herſelf thinks ſo; but when you conſider her youth, her high ſpirits, her well-known fidelity to you, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0147101501:79"/>above all, the perils ſhe has ſafely paſſed, without a ſingle ſoul to protect her, you have, I think, on the whole, rather more reaſon to laugh it off as a frolic, than to chide her for it as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety.</p>
               <p>Whatever mode of receiving her you propoſe ſhall be attended to, and if you cannot come all the way yourſelf, I will ſee that ſhe is re-conducted to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Italy, or even to your very houſe in Rome, or to that in Paris, if you judge it neceſſary. Your anſwer will determine me in every thing that relates to the lady, whom I have the honour, in the mean time, to have in protection. Be aſſured, Sir, the truſt is as ſafe as it is ſacred; and that I am, with all a friend's anxiety, Your</p>

               <p>WHAT is to be done now, my dear LASCELLES?—a circumſtance hath fallen out, even worſe than the affair of AUGUSTA. Mr. DE GREY forgot to inform me, that the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom I ſhould not meet at Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Green would make a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed member of his ſummer ſociety! But yet, how ſhould he imagine it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to apprize me of it, knowing, as he does, of our long friendſhip, and <hi>not</hi> knowing there is any <hi>delicate matter</hi> on which it depends? The nature of my difficulty will appear to you better, when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0147101501:100"/>I tell you <hi>Medway</hi> is of the party— MEDWAY, the moſt generous, poſitive, good-humoured, quarrelſome man in the univerſe—MEDWAY, whoſe ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of honour, and jealous miſconcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, expoſe him every hour to a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his life. If you have forgot my ſituation with this flaming hero, the incloſures will revive the whole track of the ſtory in your memory. Had I not apprehended that he was to paſs the ſummer in Oxfordſhire, I ſhould, by no means, have accepted of an invitation even from Mr. DE GREY; nor indeed ſhould I, by right, have left Italy till the ſecret cauſe of my going thither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Mrs. MEDWAY, and had retired with her huſband from Prudence Green. As the good of ſociety is no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the communication of this my private boſom ſecret, no man but Mr. LASCELLES is truſted with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0147101501:101"/>
As to AUGUSTA, I am glad to find ſhe is ſo well reconciled to our laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Your ſiſter will certainly, by her enchanting treatment, make a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough convert of her; and at leaſt keep her quiet without more interviews till I get the Marquis's anſwer. Were it not, therefore, for MEDWAY's affair, I ſhould now go down to the Green in high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. With regard to LUCIA, I conſider her ſo much the property of another, that I could certainly meet her <hi>unalarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> were not that other under the ſame roof.</p>

               <p>HE comes! he comes!—this night he will be here—yes, my dear LASCELLES—CARLISLE will this <hi>very</hi> night be here; but, perhaps, your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his old friend, may have already heard from him. We all wiſh for him with the fondeſt impatience. Even the impetuous MEDWAY acknowledges him to be a man of the fineſt honour in the world. By the bye, CAROLINE, that MEDWAY is a ſtrange being; I know not what to make of him—he is always begging me to ſmile upon him, and when I <hi>do</hi> ſmile, he whiſpers in my
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0147101501:107"/>ear, "huſh! huſh! my dear ſoul, huſh! don't <hi>ſpeak</hi> about it—a ſmile is enough; a ſmile is enough." He came to me yeſterday evening in the garden, and muſt needs change flowers—I agreed to his humour, and he cried out (in a tranſport that almoſt frightened me) "ſuch a little tranſaction as this, with thoſe who act upon terms of honour, binds the bargain as firmly as the bonds of Hymen." He may be a very gallant man, my dear, but he is the ſtrangeſt creature I know, for all that, and though our acquaintance is of two years ſtanding, he is as much a riddle to me as ever. The beſt part of him is, that he is the friend of CARLISLE—<hi>I</hi> am CARLISLE's FRIEND too, but I ſtill enjoin you not to hint this to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture breathing. A little before I firſt ſaw MEDWAY, I really thought CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE had an affection for me; but
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0147101501:108"/>many things have concurred ſince, to perſuade me, that I am not only indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but diſagreeable to him. His excurſion to <hi>Italy,</hi> above all other things, confirms this.—Ah, CAROLINE! how can ſo gentle and ſuſceptible a heart as his be inſenſible to—But I have done.</p>

               <p>WELCOME, thrice welcome to your native ſhore; welcome to thoſe ſhades which are now blooming at your arrival. I have this minute attended Lord and Lady BLESSINGBOURNE, and their nephew the antic Sir ANDREW, from their carriage.

               <p>OH! joy, joy, give me joy without end, my dear HEATHCOATE! Such game, ſuch fun, ſuch a ſummer is before me, that neither you or I can poſſibly want amuſement. Prudence Place is abſolutely crammed with <hi>the</hi> entertainment which, of all others, you and I moſt adore; even with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>ridicule.</hi> There are no leſs than three originals in the houſe, beſides my uncle and aunt, who, even yet, are not entirely out of date. Here is a farmer who would be a <hi>gentleman;</hi> his wife, beautiful as Venus, who would be a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0147101501:112"/>
                  <hi>lady.</hi> The farmer's brother, who, tho' neither fiſh, fleſh, nor fowl, deſigns to be a ſcholar; and my dear aunt and uncle, who are magnificent, ſuperb, high-bred—<hi>nothings at all.</hi> With ſuch a groupe, (not forgetting that ſon of the ſeven Furies, OLLY MEDWAY) if I don't have ſome precious ſport, and ſend you from time to time ſome ſheets full of <hi>fun,</hi> why then I have loſt my knack, and nature tries to entertain me in vain, this ſummer. That's all I ſay on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>As to LUCIA DE GREY, and her dad, they are quite upon the grave order you know, and a man may look at their tempers for twelve months together, without finding a tittle that is ludicrous; ſo that, I fear, we can ſcarce rank any of theſe amongſt our ſources: no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ridicule is pregnant in every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0147101501:113"/>child of the <hi>others,</hi> and you may expect to have a diſh of the dear, dear ridiculous (to <hi>me</hi> more palatable than ortolans) at leaſt every ſecond poſt-day. But, heighty-teighty, who have we here! What figure comes prancing down yon avenue, majeſtic as the oaks which ſhade, and debonnair as the ſkies which encanopy it! It gains upon me as I ſurvey it from the window. Thoſe little animals called men, when mounted upon the backs of thoſe larger animals called horſes, are proper objects for the ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſuch ſpirits as our's, my HEATH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COATE. But, in this <hi>particular inſtance,</hi> in this moſt brilliant exception, there is no hinge whereon to faſten a joke: <hi>this</hi> object looks like a <hi>man</hi> even while he is beſtriding a <hi>beaſt.</hi> His hair is caught by the gale—his proportions charm away the very genius of <hi>burleſque.</hi> I have not a jeſt in my imagination to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0147101501:114"/>throw at him. No fun in <hi>this</hi> viſitor neither!—He alights—Zounds, HEATHCOATE, this fellow hath found out the art of diſplaying the graces in getting from his ſtirrup: the very horſe ſeems conſcious of his burthen: he gives a paw of reluctance at quitting him. The family are all flocking about the ſtranger—what prince—what deity is it who can thus attract univerſal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and turn <hi>my</hi> deſcriptions out of their accuſtomed channel!</p>
               <p>I muſt lay down the pen to enquire.</p>

                  <head>In Continuation.</head>
                  <p>HEATHCOATE, could you poſſibly believe it?—The very image of one of my <hi>oldeſt</hi> acquaintances, yea even of my ſchoolfellow (who was a clever fellow when I was a dunce) had quite left me— yes, HEATHCOATE, ſuch improvements are made in every part of <hi>Captain Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle's ever</hi>-handſome perſon, that I knew him not, till another of his ornaments (melting from his captivating voice) brought him again into my memory. One would think there could be no great matter of attraction for ſuch a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous being as I, in ſeeing a young man pay compliments to a parcel of people, who were <hi>prepared</hi> for ſuch ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; and yet, by my ſoul, I ſtood
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0147101501:116"/>gaping at this ſalutation, as if I was as young a beginner as the HEWSONS. I queſtion, whether the god of Breeding himſelf could have pulled off his hat with ſuch an air—then his attention was ſo properly <hi>diſtributed</hi>—Zounds, HEATH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COATE, his bows went through the very ſouls of the women—But what have <hi>I</hi> to do with <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſubject!—CARLISLE is come to make us all look ugly in the eyes of the wenches, and ſo there is an end of it.—</p>
                  <p>However, for this diſappointment <hi>one</hi> way, I am reſolved to have full meaſure of revenge <hi>another:</hi> ſince a brighter ſun appears, and <hi>I</hi> can only be in ſhadow, I am determined not to be diſgraced without vengeance. As I cannot <hi>ſhine,</hi> I will <hi>laugh</hi> moſt inordinately; and I here ſwear by the rubied lips of LUCIA DE GREY, that I will enjoy every thing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0147101501:117"/>that ridicule can fairly catch at through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the flowery regions of Prudence Place. Neither man nor beaſt ſhall eſcape me, if either leaneth, yea but ever ſo little, to the ludicrous. This vow is ſealed by the ſanction of Jupiter: I nod, and knit my brows upon it.</p>

               <p>I AM arrived ſafe, my dear friend; but freſh embarraſſments riſe before me. I was more affected at the ſight of LUCIA DE GREY than I ought to be. Amidſt all the air of general gaiety, the eyes of MEDWAY were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently fixed on me the whole evening. Much of what is commonly called <hi>fun,</hi> paſſed at the ſupper table, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of two or three fooliſh people, who are out of their element.—Neither MEDWAY, nor LUCIA, partook of this.

If this proſpect of being perpetually tormented by the vigilant jealouſies of this hot-headed man continues, and if I cannot ſo far maſter my own ſenſibilities on a certain occaſion, my ſtay in this quarter will certainly not be long. It is living under a double impriſonment both of ſoul and body. Nor, till the Marchioneſs is gone, can I, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, repair again to your houſe. The rule of my life hath ever been, not to throw myſelf unneceſſarily into the path of temptation. It is to my <hi>feelings</hi> (which are always poignantly wounded by the leaſt ſhaft of <hi>ſelf-reproach</hi>) as well as to my ſenſe of <hi>religion,</hi> that I owe eſcape from many a miſchief into which I otherwiſe might fall. I pique myſelf a little upon the virtue of making a ſeaſonable <hi>retreat.</hi> My ſenſibility tells me <hi>now,</hi> that I am <hi>here</hi> in danger: I ſhould be, by no means, in a road abſolutely ſafe, if I
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0147101501:122"/>were with <hi>you.</hi> It will require ſome adroitneſs to diſentangle myſelf. If matters do not mend, I muſt alter my preſent addreſs; although, were my <hi>heart</hi> quite eaſy, I could be well enough amuſed with this motley groupe at Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Place, and enter into every inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive levity with the moſt ſerious ſpirit imaginable. You ſee, by the air of my letter, that at preſent I can neither write or ſpeak with certainty of <hi>any thing.</hi> I can only ſay, in general terms, that the joys I anticipated, like moſt things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled, do not ſparkle in the cup ſo briſkly as I expected; they are daſhed by ſome bitter diſappointments. I have a paſſion fretting my heart, which hath no lawful right to lie in my boſom. I feel it to be the tyrannizing ſerpent;—I ſmart under the ſharpneſs of its tooth, and yet, like the man in the fable, I foſter it. Do you not think, my LAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLES,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0147101501:123"/>that LUCIA's paſſion for the boiſterous <hi>Medway,</hi> is a little inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with that uncommon delicacy and <hi>gentleneſs</hi> which ſeem to mark her own mind? But there is nothing ſo idle as an attempt to decypher the hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phics of love. Mr. MEDWAY is the man of her choice; Mr. MEDWAY is, therefore, not to be queſtioned upon the ſubject of his <hi>ſucceſs.</hi>

               <p>IT touches me very nearly to be ſo ſoon under a neceſſity of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to you a letter from our fair lady, which, if I may judge from the air of anger with which it was given, does not contain the ſentiments of a quiet diſpoſition. Previous to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here the other night, I ſaw through the little artifice of her <hi>dreſſing at you</hi> in full taſte: it brought to my mind that ſweet line of the poet:
<q>Now aweful beauty puts on all her charms.</q>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0147101501:125"/>Notwithſtanding this, you had fortitude of <hi>reſiſtance</hi> ſuperior even to her <hi>beauty.</hi> How you are able to do theſe things is wonderful: for my part, I fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, if I knew any lady, of any country, half ſo lovely, and half ſo longing, I certainly ſhould ſuffer any little <hi>ſcruples</hi> I might have to be ſoon over-ruled; and were it in my power to make ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happy, happy ſhe ſhould be. As to the Marchioneſs, ſhe hath fire enough in her eyes even to talk down the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of an anchorite. Not that I blame your virtue, or accuſe your taſte. No, my dear CARLISLE, I admire both; I look up to the one with envy, to the other with deſpair. But this is no time either for comment or compliment: the Marchioneſs's letters to you ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to be forwarded, ſince, from the peculiar <hi>violence</hi> of her temper, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's delay might produce the moſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0147101501:126"/>diſagreeable conſequences. My ſiſter wiſhes every hour for the Marquis's letter, although it is impoſſible he ſhould get <hi>your's</hi> for ſome time. The two la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies parted from each other yeſterday in tears. I am not yet maſter of the meaning. CAROLINE's confidence is impregnable; unleſs ſhe thinks it <hi>right</hi> to diſcloſe any matter, her deareſt friends would not be let into the ſecret.</p>

               <p>HAVE I not ſufficient cauſe to curſe my fate, that hath left me without one ſolid reaſon to ſanctify my affection? Have I not reaſon too, to curſe that barbarous father, who ſacrificed me to the moſt hateful man upon earth—who ſold me for a title which I deſpiſe, and to embraces which are bitter to me as the bonds of death? The great, the counterbalancing arguments, Mr. CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE, are all on your ſide, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my pleadings are all againſt the tide. But I ſee all that is to happen— you will never ſee me more—you refuſe me your direction—you will have your
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0147101501:128"/>London apartments—your friends will grow weary of me, and I ſhall be in utter deſpair. Ah! what a foundation have I for ſuch ſuſpicions! How cuttingly cold was the air with which you laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed me! How cautiouſly cruel your civility!—You took my hand, but it trembled as if at the touch of infection, while mine, on the contrary, throbbed with a violence that denoted the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my heart. Your whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was <hi>general;</hi> or, if it ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>particular,</hi> it turned upon my huſband—the moſt deteſted of all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But this was not enough; you dare not truſt yourſelf with me alone: I am reduced to ſuch infamy that it was neceſſary to converſe with me in the preſence of a third perſon; that third perſon, too, muſt needs be a <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> But you were deceived: I did not in that complotted interview ſhew
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0147101501:129"/>myſelf ſo abandoned as you expected: I was conſcious of the deepneſs of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and I fell before it.

I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you, however, Mr. CARLISLE, by love, and I charge you by what is due to diſtreſs, not to inſult her whom you cannot redreſs.

               <p>OH, my beloved CAROLINE! Mr. CARLISLE is at our houſe, and yet I am more wretched than I was before his arrival. He certainly deteſts me. He ſpeaks in form, and though he can never loſe his politeneſs, which is a part of his very nature, yet he has wholly loſt his friendſhip. How can I poſſibly have forfeited this? We were bred up together, you know, CAROLINE; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the ſame houſe, for ſome time in the ſame cradle: it is to CARLISLE I owe my early reliſh for reading, and every better ornament. Nothing could poſſibly be more cordial, or more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0147101501:131"/>than we were formerly. Wherefore hath he robbed me of his attention—of his <hi>brotherly</hi> attention?—But, I ſuppoſe he hath been fortunate in his <hi>Italian at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments</hi>—the friendſhips of a warmer clime are, doubtleſs, more attracting and more animated. I know not what to think. Certainly, Mr. CARLISLE never gave me reaſon to imagine I was more in his eſteem <hi>than—than—than—.</hi> But why do I talk, CAROLINE? he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely does every thing but flatly ſhun me.</p>
               <p>To increaſe my vexation, that tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome wretch MEDWAY becomes more ſtrange than ever. Half an hour ago he put into my hand the nonſenſe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe:</p>

               <p>BETTER and better ſtill! the gudgeons bite this warm weather at Prudence Place moſt gloriouſly. Every minute teems with ridicule. I have played off that <hi>heavieſt of the Hewſon lump,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry,</hi> upon my <hi>uncle,</hi> yea even upon the pompous muſcles of Lord BLESSINGBOURNE, to whom the farmer hath written in form, juſt to <hi>get into's fiſt,</hi> as he elegantly phraſes it. I ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited him up to this, and ſo contrived it, that the letter ſhould be given to his Lordſhip exactly at the proper criſis— even while he was at a magnificent tête<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>à-tête
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0147101501:141"/>with my Lady upon that conſtant ſubject of theirs, the dignity of rank and family. I took care alſo to enter his room, by the way of morning <hi>devoir,</hi> juſt as the epiſtle was delivered—No co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet at the top of the ſeal—and yet— the ſcrawling and <hi>genteel up-and-down of the ſuperſcription</hi> is politely illegible enough, to come from <hi>ſomebody</hi> of <hi>rank,</hi> ſays the Earl — Doſt thou know the hand, my Lady—No indeed, my Lord —It is not in my liſt of hands—If it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches towards <hi>any</hi> of my correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents — continues my lady — it is the Counteſs of Cannotſpell. In my opinion, my Lady, ſaid I, it bears ſtrong marks of the Ducheſs of Letterblot; that copious command of capitals in the L.O.R.D. looks aſtoniſhingly like the finger and thumb of her Grace.—Whew, ſays my uncle, there's no poſt-marks: I can't poſſibly account for this, my Lady. Ten
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0147101501:142"/>to one, uncle, replied I, the contents will unravel the myſtery in a moment; that is to ſay, if the writing is not <hi>too faſhionable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordſhip broke the ſeal which Mr. HENRY told me he once valued much, it being the exact effigy of the fineſt greyhound bitch that ever <hi>nabbled the ſcut of a bare</hi>—None of <hi>my</hi> friends faſten letters, nephew, with the engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>dog</hi>—</p>
               <p>Heaven and family-honours, exclaims my never-to-be-forgotten uncle, what have we here, with <hi>my very good Lord</hi> at the top, and <hi>your H.

No, indeed, don't you, ſaid my Lady.</p>
               <p>Suffer <hi>me</hi> to read it to you, my Lord, ſaid I; I can't poſſibly conceive the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>I read it, HEATHCOATE, and gave it all its graces. It was not without great difficulty the angry Earl <hi>ſat it out.</hi> His comments were exquiſite. I incloſe the original, on purpoſe that you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a few of them—a <hi>ſimularius!</hi> cried his Lordſhip, what does the fellow mean by that? <hi>Prudunce Pleace:</hi> and pray, how could Mr. DE GREY, at his grave time of life, admit ſuch a creature as this to <hi>Prudunce Pleace? Prudunce Pleace,</hi> rejoined my Lady; oh! the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate—ha! ha! ha!</p>
               <p>I went on, but was ſoon ſtopped again. A woman of <hi>the bettermoſt ſpecie,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0147101501:144"/>a <hi>lady of this genii,</hi> and <hi>for ſhe to write to ſhe</hi>—did you ever hear ſuch impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſaid I, my Lord?</p>
               <p>Impudence, replied my Lady! Pray, nephew, order my coach this very day. Does <hi>Mr.</hi> DE GREY (who, though a very worthy man, is only a <hi>Mr.</hi>) imagine we are to be inſulted by <hi>rifraff,</hi> whom he thinks fit to make our <hi>equals?</hi> They may, perhaps, be equals for a <hi>Mr.</hi> but they are no proper company for perſons whoſe names move upon a <hi>different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That's very true, aunt, ſaid I, and it's perfectly unpardonable in that little, low-minded monoſyllable <hi>Mr.</hi> to behave thus rudely to names of a nobler ſound, and a different conſtruction. <hi>Mr.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! I ſhould not have thought of it!</p>

Don't be witty, ANDREW, neither, ſays my aunt.</p>
               <p>Madam, your Ladyſhip does me wrong, ſaid I, I deſpiſe <hi>Mr.</hi> as cordially as your Ladyſhip, and I even bought <hi>Sir Andrew,</hi> that I might never have any thing more to do with him. <hi>Mr.</hi> quotha!</p>
               <p>Be that as it may, nephew, rejoined my Lord (riſing upon his toes, and ſwelling out his breaſt, as is uſual with him when he feels the <hi>might</hi> of any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent) be that, I ſay, as it may— You very well know the <hi>ſtock</hi> from whence our family ſprung. You very very well know, that we have not a plebeian particle about us; and though it is very true you bought <hi>Sir Andrew</hi> with my money, on account of my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of <hi>Mr.</hi> yet you have the beſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0147101501:146"/>of blood in your veins.—Yes, nephew, I will take upon me to ſay, with very little exaltation of voice, you have the beſt blood. Heaven, and family-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, here's uſage indeed!</p>
               <p>Thank Heaven and my noble-blooded anceſtors, my Lord, nobody better, ſaid I.</p>
               <p>The veins of your aunt are not leſs dignified—</p>
               <p>Senſible of that, my Lord, ſaid I, her Ladyſhip's fine blood ſhines beſide her fair complexion, like the violet that groweth among the lillies of the valley.</p>
               <p>Not amiſs, ſaid my uncle, ſimpering!</p>
               <p>'<hi>Pſhaw,</hi> you madcap, cried my aunt, patting my ſhoulder, and looking at

               <p>Hang it, rejoined my uncle, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for a moment his dignity, this poor H. HEWSON means no harm after all; he is a poor ſimple thing.</p>
               <p>An unfortunate fiſh out of water, you may ſee by all his actions, ſaid I, and I dare ſay thinks he has lived upon ſhore long enough, ſince he has had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to write a letter to Lord and Lady BLESSINGBOURNE.</p>
               <p>Do you think ſo, nephew? cried my uncle and aunt (tickled by the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery); well, then, let us not be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: let the affair drop.</p>
               <p>I do really think, my Lord, rejoined I, if you were to write him an <hi>anſwer,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0147101501:148"/>you would make the poor fellow feel, as if he were in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Anſwer him, ſaid my Lord; what can I ſay to ſuch a being?</p>
               <p>Say ſomething, however, ſaid my Lady, to the poor devil.</p>
               <p>My uncle ordered the writing appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus; and after as much writing as might have been neceſſary to lay the plot of a comedy, he wrote upon a large gilt card, in a hand very little better than HEWSON's, the following ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>

                     <p>THE Earl and Counteſs of BLESSING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOURNE received H.

This card, HEATHCOATE, penn'd ſo exactly to my wiſh, after being ſealed with a flouriſh of the beſt wax, and ſtamped with the broad BLESSING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOURNE arms, capped with a coronet, and decorated with ſupporters, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to my care.</p>
               <p>I carried it to the farmer-gentleman, whom I found diſputing the point of politeneſs with that beautiful piece of ignorance his wife.—She was pleaſed to be hugely offended by the contents of his Lordſhip's card, and declared, that Mr. HEWSON writ without her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.—As to acquaintances, ſhe had plenty—that ſhe wrote every night to Miſs DE GREY, and choſe to owe her improvements to her own ingenuity.</p>
               <p>Then it's not my fault, cried the huſband; you will bear me witneſs, Sir
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0147101501:151"/>ANDREW, I have done <hi>my</hi> duty; 'tis none of my ſeeking that ſhe won't <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond</hi> with a Ladyſhip, and a Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs: as for <hi>my</hi> part, I am not above getting all I can out of high and low; ſo I ſhall write juſt as I ſee <hi>caſſion,</hi> either to my Lord or Maiſter HEATHCOATE. And now you talk <hi>o'that,</hi> I muſt go <hi>ſcheme</hi> out a letter for the laſt-named <hi>borreſpondent</hi> directly.</p>
               <p>Away he went, and I enjoyed the ſociety of his HETT. all alone. She is abſolutely a more charming woman, in my eyes, HEATHCOATE, even than LUCIA DE GREY; nor does ſhe want ſenſe, if ſhe was not ſo conſumedly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to admire every thing which you and I deſpiſe.

               <head>LETTER XXXVII. Captain CARLISLE to GEORGE LASCELLES, Eſq.</head>
               <p>I HAVE had a very fooliſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happen to aggravate the uneaſineſs of the Marchioneſs's laſt letter. It is in itſelf a trifle, yet the conſequence to my <hi>peace</hi> will make it important to you. Sir ANDREW FLIGHT was playing off his witticiſms and waggeries upon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſome country ſimpletons that are now at the <hi>Place,</hi> when I became ſo weary of his vociferous amuſement; for where is the pleaſure of ſporting with inexperience —that I withdrew to Mr. DE GREY'S garden, unobſerved, or at leaſt uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, by the company. MEDWAY
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0147101501:153"/>was watching his fiſhing-rod: Lord BLESSINGBOURNE was withdrawn to his chamber for his afternoon's nap. Mr. DE GREY'S garden is exceedingly large, and part of it is diſpoſed into a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe zig-zag is ſo intricate that you may ſometimes have your whole proſpect terminated by a yard's diſtance. The ſurrounding foliage, too, is of the thickeſt growth, being ſuffered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand for ſeveral years, receiving from the gardener, from time to time, only ſuch cares and loppings as to render the beautiful confuſion more agreeable. Seats and bowers, apparently artificial, with here and there a dripping grotto, are diſtributed irregularly, and the ſhades are every where ſo abundant, that the ſun-beams rather cheer you by <hi>ſtealth,</hi> than by permiſſion. I have, for my own part, an attachment—a ſort of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental friendſhip, and good-will, for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0147101501:154"/>every bench, and for every tree: they were all favourites of my infancy: I ſat upon the benches, and I caught inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the lips of Mr. DE GREY, under the trees. This, therefore, was the firſt time of my hailing them ſince my return. Believe me, I felt ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that thrilled me, as I re-viſited the places of my accuſtomed contemplation; I bade them welcome with as much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour as if they were animate. I walked along the green meander, recognizing my old acquaintances; I liſtened to birds whoſe notes I affected to be <hi>intimate</hi> with my ear, as if they iſſued from the ſame warblers I had heard formerly. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented the caſcades upon an <hi>improved</hi> melody in their cadence: every breeze that played upon every leaf, revived the balmy pleaſures of infancy. Even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with other countries (not odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Italy herſelf) had not been able to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0147101501:155"/>ſupplant the <hi>tenderneſs</hi> I bore to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beauties of Prudence Place.</p>
               <p>Ah, LASCELLES! what could be the reaſon of this? Preſently I came to an alcove, which was originally the archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture of two children, who grew up together. It was a whole week's labour, divided betwixt Miſs DE GREY and your CARLISLE: our little hands twiſted the twigs, formed the archings, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the obſtinate ſhrubs with inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able induſtry. Many a time we reſted from the toil, and, as often being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with our progreſs, we renewed it. When it was compleated, we gave —oh, I ſhall never forget it—a kiſs of tendereſt congratulation, as at having finiſhed a work of <hi>infinite importance.</hi> Big with this innocent flattery, we ran, hand in hand, to our guardian, and with elated hearts bade him ſurvey well
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0147101501:156"/>our workmanſhip. The gravity with which he commended, and his affected aſtoniſhment at our <hi>ingenuity,</hi> gave the laſt and fulleſt ſtroke of our pride and vanity. Over the entrance, our guardian cauſed to be imprinted upon a label, in golden letters, this ſoothing intelligence to the ſtranger:</p>
               <p>This Bower was raiſed by Clement and Lucia.</p>
               <p>The robin-redbreaſt built in it the next, the <hi>very</hi> next year, and we had then, you know, the beſt reaſon in the world to think that Heaven itſelf was pleaſed with our amuſement. The neſt, you may be ſure, was preſerved, for both piety and pity were concerned in its protection. We trod with caution while the <hi>ſacred</hi> bird was hatching: the whole feathered family preſently took wing; and I do verily believe I hear one of them now whiſtling near my window.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0147101501:157"/>
Oh, LASCELLES! how ſoon is the heart that wiſhes to be inoffenſive, lulled by little circumſtances! Smile not, then, if I tell you, that I ſaw with tranſport the names of LUCIA and CLEMENT ſtill legible on their bower—the branches of ſweetbriar, on either ſide, were eagerly extending as if to embrace—and I beheld the initials of my name very <hi>recently</hi> cut in the rind of a hawthorn, that formed one of the ſupports of our alcove.</p>
               <p>What ſweet circumſtances — how they melt the heart! cried I.</p>
               <p>At that moment the ſofteſt-tuned voice in the world repeated diſtinctly the following verſes, from her favourite poet:</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0147101501:158"/>

                     <l>In theſe deep ſolitudes, and aweful cells,</l>
                     <l>Where heav'nly penſive Contemplation dwells,</l>
                     <l>And ever-muſing Melancholy reigns;</l>
                     <l>What means this tumult in a Veſtal's veins?</l>
                     <l>Why rove my thoughts beyon! this laſt retreat?</l>
                     <l>Why feels my heart it's long-forgotten heat?</l>
                     <l>Yet, yet I <hi>love,</hi> from ABELARD it came,</l>
                     <l>And ELOISA yet muſt kiſs the name.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>You are not to be told it was LUCIA DE GREY. In the next inſtant ſhe paſſed within ſight of me, the book ſtill in her hand. Unprepared on both ſides for the ſurprize, we were inexpreſſibly confuſed. Beautiful lines, Miſs DE GREY, ſaid I. Yes, indeed, replied ſhe. I think, Miſs DE GREY, in a former part of our life we uſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to read the charming Mr. POPE <hi>together</hi>—In this very garden, Mr. CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE; do you recollect your old bower, ſaid ſhe? If I miſtake not, Madam, ſaid I—Madam, CLEMENT? Madam,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0147101501:159"/>Mr. CARLISLE? replied ſhe, as if a little offended. I ſay, continued I, Miſs DE GREY, if I remember right, <hi>this</hi> is that bower. You had almoſt forgot it, then, Mr. CARLISLE, had you? I ſuppoſe <hi>Italy</hi> (the garden of the univerſe) hath put all our <hi>Engliſh</hi> roſes quite out of countenance: Prudence Place is, to be ſure, a mere nettle-bed.—Ah, no, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam! (ſaid I, upon the edge of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, but happily checking myſelf in time) though certainly Italy hath its charms. Oh, no doubt of it, replied LUCIA; but I believe, Sir, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will have loſt their chief felicity by your abſence. I hear Mr. <hi>Medway</hi> coming; I know his rapid, random ſtep; and I dare ſay his errand is from the deſerted ſociety to the runaway Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain CARLISLE. If you pleaſe, Miſs DE GREY, we will retire, then. I will juſt finiſh my poem and follow you, Sir.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0147101501:160"/>We parted. 'Tis evident ſhe loves MEDWAY to diſtraction, LASCELLES — She <hi>knows his ſtep.</hi>—He was then in ſearch of her, <hi>doubtleſs, by her appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>—I wiſh them happy—very, very happy. But my head aches; my heart is not quite well; and I muſt wiſh you a good night.</p>

               <p>CONFUSION, TOWNSEND! I have diſcovered the plot—I have got a clue to the whole matter. I am, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, a very catſpaw. I am made the convenient cloak to conceal the paſſion of <hi>another.</hi> Yes, TOWNSEND, I ſaw CARLISLE at the very fartheſt end of DE GREY's garden in earneſt converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with LUCIA: at my approach he turned into a different walk, and went into the houſe. I overtook the guilty fair one, and caught her in the very act of reading ELOISA to ABELARD; which is as much as to ſay, if I can't talk with him, I can at leaſt <hi>write a letter</hi> to him;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0147101501:162"/>and I dare ſay they do correſpond: every body in this family ſcribbles, and I don't at all doubt but there is fine flouriſhing penwork going forward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween LUCIA and CARLISLE. As to the firſt, I only walked quickly <hi>by</hi> her, without deigning to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and I pulled off my hat with unuſual reſpect, as much as to ſay—Oh, oh, my young lady, have I caught you! I ſhall repeat the ſame behaviour when I meet her again, and then it is impoſſible ſhe ſhould miſtake my meaning. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Captain, whom I honour as a friend and gentleman, in every <hi>other</hi> matter, his life is not worth ſixpence, for he muſt as ſurely die this night, as that he inſulted me this day; or elſe he muſt injure me ſtill more, by taking me off.

               <p>GIVE every man his title and dignification, as Lord BLESSINGBOURNE ſays, therefore I begin my <hi>horreſpondunce</hi> with you, at the inſtigation of Sir AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DREW, with calling you Eſquire, which is certainly your due, ſeeing you are out of trade, and do <hi>nothing at all for your livelyhood.</hi> I am to write what I get in the way of breedin, it ſeems, to you, which is a thing pleaſing, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you muſt, without doubt, be a maſter of the buſineſs.</p>

But I believe I ſhall have a weariſome ſpell o'work on't, before I am as I ſhould be: caſe why? there goes more to the making an honeſt man a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man than I had at firſt any <hi>ideerer</hi> of. I ha' been <hi>i'th'way on't</hi> only three or four days, and I can ſee, already, <hi>t'an't</hi> to be run up, as a man would run up a rick of hay. Ods woundlikins, Eſquire HEATHCOATE, there is no end on't. But howſomever, to ſhew you that I am not quite a <hi>numſcull,</hi> I'll juſt mention a few matters that I ha' got in memory, which is as thof one were to call it a ſtorehouſe to lay by things for future uſe. In the firſt place you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I ſee plain enough that the firſt rule of your <hi>bettermoſt</hi> perſon is to make a bit of a pleaſant grin come into's <hi>phiſihog</hi> whenever he firſt meets any one, as much as to ſignify, that he knows how to carry his head. In the next
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0147101501:179"/>place, I find 'tis proper to make up this bit of a grin at firſt ſight, whether you like the man or not. Caſe why? a gentleman ſhould not ſhew that he is cuſs'd angry, <hi>cept</hi> upon <hi>caſſion</hi> of intereſt, ſeeing that <hi>pliteneſs</hi> knows how to ſmile i'th' face, while it puts finger in pocket. 3dly, I ha' noticed, that the leſs a man puts <hi>bat</hi> on's head, the better: Caſe why? it's the ſooner doff'd without pinching out the corners; beſides which, its <hi>plite</hi> to carry powder and <hi>pummadum</hi> enough to keep the cranium comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without it. I find a ſtrange <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> Eſquire, in getting my foot into the right ſlide of <hi>pliteneſs;</hi> for, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives head and foot dive together— <hi>out</hi> goes foot, <hi>down</hi> goes head: this is a cuſs'd crankum piece of buſineſs. Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your preſence, I can't ſee the fun of bowing and ſcraping <hi>too:</hi> nay, ifack, what do I talk of that? ſome here, at
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0147101501:180"/>
                  <hi>Prudunce Pleace</hi> muſt needs kiſs their hands, and then ſwing 'em out at the ſame time. The young <hi>Captain</hi> does this; aye, Eſquire, young CARLISLE's hands, head, and heels, all work at once, as ſmooth and cutely as a bird i'th' air. I'd give almoſt more than I'm worth, if I could but wriggle out the hinder part o'me, juſt like Lord BLESSINGBOURNE: when <hi>he</hi> firſt comes into room, I warrant me, he does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>treat</hi> and <hi>vance,</hi> ſhuffle and cut, and go backwards and forwards, ſticking out his rump, and <hi>craning</hi> his fine, thin, long, meagre, nine-haired head, which I find is the <hi>pliteſt</hi> head a man can have. Yet he knows who's to have a wriggle of the bum, and who not, too: I warrant you he is a cute one: he don't gig and drop his fine <hi>plite</hi> head to every body alike: no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me; he has the meaſure of what's
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0147101501:181"/>every man's due, from the Duke to the ſtable-boy. Down goes his genteel head quite on's breaſt, to Captain CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE; but when I puts in for a bit of civility, I can't get his neck to move downward half ſo civilly—Caſe why? I am but a poor fellow juſt come among <hi>plite ſpecie.</hi> But I don't allow myſelf any 'vantages; for though I ha' put on the beſt ſuit to my back, <hi>t'an't</hi> at all the thing. Sir ANDREW ſays my wig is enough to ruin me for ever, if there were nothing elſe in the way. 'Tis as good a bob as ever was bought, and ſits as ſnugly to <hi>feace;</hi> but, alas! what's a bob where you ſhan't ſee any thing under a bag, and that <hi>flourididdled</hi> with rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons and <hi>toſſicums?</hi> Young CARLISLE, indeed, lets <hi>his</hi> hair fly to and fro, juſt as he and the wind can ſettle it: Caſe why? he has ſo much on't, and 'tis ſo well coloured, and twirls itſelf off into
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0147101501:182"/>ſuch ringlets, that <hi>he</hi> is <hi>plite</hi> any way. I ha' beſpoke a bag, though I know <hi>afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand</hi> 'twill make a devil o'me, and ſo I told GAB, who is to ha' the fellow on't. Comfort, tho', that I can't look worſe than GAB when I'm bag'd, bag me when they will. For at any rate, I ha' gotten fleſh on my feace, and a little jot of colour i'my cheeks to ſet it off, as well as a ſtout pair of ſhoulders; whereas GAB has werretted all the fleſh off's bones by larning. Without a word of a joke, Eſquire, I don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve GAB has a pound of ſubſtance on's whole <hi>carkiſs;</hi> and as <hi>to's jaws,</hi> has no more meat upon them than upon the bill of chicken: his back is quite a <hi>ſkelitum;</hi> and though his hair is no bad raven-colour, yet it grows ſo cuſs'd <hi>odd on's head,</hi> and is ſo <hi>lankum rat-eaten'um,</hi> as a body might
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0147101501:183"/>ſay, if they were mind to talk larned, that I would not gee frap of a finger <hi>for's whole growth.</hi> But now I'm upon good breeding, Eſquire, I deſire to know whether a trick I ſaw Lord BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SINGBOURNE (who is ever <hi>acold) do</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day 'fore men, women, and children, is the <hi>common practiſe</hi> of your bettermoſt ſpecie: that is, ſtanding with bumfiddle to fire with coat up, and now and then popping hand <hi>below</hi> waiſtband. May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, my Lord mayn't be quite ſo <hi>well</hi> as he would be thereabouts, juſt at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and it may be a comfort <hi>to'un</hi> to feel now and then how matters go; for which reaſon I won't venture upon this action till I know whether 'tis a general thing or not. Not that I diſlike it, but that juſt yet it ſeems aukward to ſuch an ignorant <hi>feller</hi> as I.</p>

Nothing i'th'way of breeding more, at preſent—But I ha' filled my paper, which I take to be always the <hi>plite</hi> thing. So I reſt, at the bottom of the ſheet,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>MY beſt and deareſt CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE muſt pardon the formality of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an old friend's letter, dated, written, and directed from the ſame houſe that contains both the writer and reader of it. The reaſon is, Prudence Place is at this time ſo crouded with different ſorts of people, and one has ſo little opportunity to ſteal leiſure for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the <hi>higher kind,</hi> that I do not imagine a ſubject which is at this criſis ſo very warm at my heart, can be ſo well or ſo explicitly handled as upon
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0147101501:186"/>paper. So much for the apology: I come now to the <hi>matter.</hi>—The days, the months, the years of <hi>tuition</hi> are now paſt—thoſe ſeaſons, my CLEMENT, in which I had the honour and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (for it was both) to point out to you the paths of propriety and of virtue, are over; for the <hi>Pupil</hi> is even already, at the moſt early age of twenty-one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Preceptor:</hi> he is the <hi>Tutor of Truth:</hi> he hath already got orphans and widows under his guardianſhip — the nobleſt of all guardianſhip, my CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT—the guardianſhip of <hi>Senſibility.</hi> I <hi>thank</hi> you, Sir, for doing me ſo much honour. When you left this country for ITALY, I did not imagine there was room for improvements; you were ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, polite, and prudent; as free from pedantry, on the one hand, as from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation and the diſtracted joys of an overgrown boy, on the other. Yet, on
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0147101501:187"/>my firſt beholding you, the other day, I was ſtruck with an <hi>additional</hi> finiſhing, an elegant <hi>compleatneſs,</hi> which, though not before ſeeming to be wanted, was, as it <hi>now</hi> appears, abſolutely neceſſary. Forgive the garrulous vanity of an old man, Sir; forgive me, if I lodge, with all the narrative tediouſneſs of age, a little longer on this part of the ſubject. There are circumſtances, which <hi>allow</hi> us to ſwell out the heart, without making it ridiculous. You, Sir, occaſion in me a pride of this nature. Some men's ambition, in the laſt ſtate of life, is gratified by walking, or rather hobbling, into their fields and gardens, to recognize thoſe flouriſhing ſhades which are the produce of their own cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation. I have heard a veteran neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of mine, a thouſand times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,—See, Mr. DE GREY, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious I have been! that long and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0147101501:188"/>luſty range of oaks, extending from this paſture even to the farthermoſt avenue in the next, did I plant with my own hand.—I remember the day when the whole row (containing, perhaps, two hundred ſticks of timber) were ſo many petty acorns not ſo big as a walnut; and ſee, only ſee how they have ſped. I could raiſe a little navy—verily, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I could fit out a fleet, with a wood of my own raiſing.</p>
               <p>Such ideas, I own, are not diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, CLEMENT: but they are far from being expanded enough, for <hi>my</hi> emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; my emulation chooſes a nobler object, and takes a wider courſe. My object, Sir, is not circumſcribed by any thing within the ſcope of <hi>inanimate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and though I could be able to look out upon whole foreſts of my own cultivation, it would not ſatisfy me.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0147101501:189"/>No, Mr. CARLISLE, I have a far <hi>finer</hi> pleaſure. I have it to ſay, that the politeſt gentleman, and the beſt man of his age, was once the child of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. He was left by that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which took to itſelf his natural parents, at an age when gentle treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes a parent of any one. I received this dear and delicate truſt from the trembling arm of a dying man, and I value it, as a legacy given me in the moment that the ſoul of a friend was departing. Yes, at ſuch a tender period, was you bequeathed to me, Mr. CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE: my child, LUCIA, was exactly of the ſame age; and you grew together. The beauty of your forms, like the power of your minds, was ſimilar. I can only ſay farther, that nature points out to me none of her nice diſtinctions or partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. In the hour of your childhood I careſſed you both with the ſame ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0147101501:190"/>and now that you are mature I divide my heart <hi>evenly</hi> between you. But this touch of tranſport hath ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me into a digreſſion. Old folks are, I perceive, on their favourite ſubject, as tireſome in their writing as in their talking; and therefore they have as few correſpondents as hearers. It is time, however, to return to my ſubject.</p>
               <p>On looking back at my account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, my dear Mr. CARLISLE, I find that your birth-day hath gone by almoſt a month. You ſeem to have forgot that it entitles you to the command and ſole diſpoſition of an immenſe fortune. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was, I am proud to ſay, never a diſputable point with us, except when coercive meaſures were obliged to be taken in order to force upon you a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance. This, however, by no means exculpates me for detaining what ought
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0147101501:191"/>to be in more amiable, as well as more able hands. I reproach myſelf, when I conſider how many cruelties my delay may have been guilty of, Mr. CARLISLE, to thoſe whoſe fortunes <hi>you</hi> have in truſt: methinks, I hear the curſe of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, the languiſhing ſigh of ſickneſs, and the murmur of merit in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vale: I ſee, too, the tears ſtream from the eyes of the fatherleſs—Oh! for Heaven's ſake, my friend, relieve me—reſcue me, inſtantly, from conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the injury to that part of your family which Providence hath put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your care.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, moſt readily, be prepared to render up an ample account of my agency, whenever (and the ſooner the better) you will honour me with your appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0147101501:192"/>
Thus much for <hi>fortune.</hi> I had it in my mind, CLEMENT, to venture a few ſentiments upon <hi>happineſs,</hi> which are, by no means, things incompatible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not often inſeparable. But any thing I could advance on this head is unneceſſary to ſuch a <hi>mind</hi> as your's. With reſpect to your <hi>heart,</hi> I own, I meditated a few words upon <hi>that</hi> ſubject alſo: but I am in great doubt, whether this is the proper point of time to ſpeak to it; yet my propenſity is ſo warm, and the prattling, or rather, at preſent, ſcribbling, old man, is ſo ſtrong, or, to ſpeak more truly, ſo <hi>feeble</hi> in me, that I can ſcarce reſiſt.</p>
               <p>The intereſt of your heart muſt naturally, my dear CLEMENT, be of more concern to me than any other that belongs to you. You are exactly at the age when tenderneſs falls with the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0147101501:193"/>fulleſt force upon our nature; as you have a form to command love, ſo have you feeling to return it. That ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which makes you a parent to the poor, and thoſe accompliſhments which endear you to ſociety, in general, will aſſiſt and even lead to connexions of a ſofter kind. I am afraid, it would border a little upon that impertinence which I would avoid, elſe I ſhould aſk you, in the cordiality of my good wiſhes, whether it is <hi>poſſible</hi> for ſo amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man, to have paſſed through <hi>Italy,</hi> and to have reſided in the capital of England, (the very court of female beauty) with an inclination unattached, and paſſions unalarmed.

               <p>YOU confeſs then that you have written to the deteſted Marquis: you even avow the ſentiments of your letter to him; you own, that they are to <hi>haſten him to England.</hi> But do you think, Sir, I am to be thus treated like a child, and threatened with being chid by that bugbear, <hi>my huſband?</hi> or do you imagine, I will ever allow myſelf to be re-united to him. Prepoſterous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation! No, Mr. CARLISLE, tho' I am a ſlave to my own paſſions, I will
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0147101501:197"/>never more be a ſlave to thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! You argue in vain about rights and laws and duties—in vain you urge the maxims of the world, and the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of nations. I have lived ſo long under the Italian heavens, that I have forgot—utterly forgot—the colder atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere of cloudy England. I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to follow my feelings, and to abhor chains that were forced upon me by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal authority. You direct me to the ſacred circle of gold upon my fingers; you call it the caeſtus of fidelity. I grew enraged to conſider a man, ſcarce more than twenty, thus coldly argue upon a tender offer of no contemptible paſſion. My <hi>pride</hi> took the alarm, and I tore your epiſtle, and threw the ring from my finger at the ſame time. I ſtampt upon it with indignation. Miſs LASCELLES appeared, and, as if you had pre-inſtructed her, ſhe acted upon
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0147101501:198"/>the occaſion as the very prieſteſs of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. "Fie, my dear Marchioneſs, (ſaid ſhe, folding her palms together in the true conventicle manner) theſe outrages are ever dreadful, but when they ariſe from ſo bad a <hi>cauſe,</hi> what ſtrength of terms can ſufficiently reprobate them! Conſider the reſerve and decorum of your ſex!—conſider the conſequences!— conſider your character!"</p>
               <p>Ah frigid inſolent! is this the mode of Britiſh hoſpitality? Do you <hi>leſſon</hi> thoſe whom you protect? and do you, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, boaſt of your iſland as an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum for the wretched, and for the ſtranger?

               <p>The ſubject muſt be hateful to you, and I will quit it: but, ſtill, Mr. CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE, ſomething is due to my <hi>pride,</hi> whatever is denied to my <hi>paſſion.</hi> I will not ſtay here to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair is delicate—ſhe hopes that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will prevail.</p>
               <p>Ah! CARLISLE, that my extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of affection ſhould have reduced
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0147101501:200"/>me to this! Oh! that I could change— Oh! that I could reverſe the paſſion—I would ſacrifice fifty years of my life to hate you.</p>
               <p>Ah! what have I ſaid? To what violation of the truth hath my paſſion led me? No, my CARLISLE, no; I would not wiſh to hate you—wretched as I am, I would not even wiſh to love you leſs. Though the agony is extreme, there are moments of tranſport, known only to boſoms like mine, that repay me for it. Hate you—O heavens! what a word! what an idea to mix with that, which dreſſes up the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible CARLISLE! Pardon the blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which are ſtaining this part of my paper. They are made by tears that ſhew at leaſt ſome tincture of virtue. In other circumſtances you ſay it would
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0147101501:201"/>have been your pride to have courted the ſoftneſs which is now ſo preſſingly offered. How then is it poſſible <hi>my</hi> eyes ſhould be dry, when I perceive thoſe circumſtances ſo unlikely ever to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen? Yet, I cannot loſe the idea—I cannot diſengage myſelf from the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though I know it to be no more. Perſiſt then in your virtue, Sir; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me not the little gale of pleaſure that blows from fancy. Continue to let me hope—continue to correſpond— only condeſcend to allow me the flattery of thinking I am not hated by the lovelieſt of men, and I will ſuſtain any thing for his ſake. I will remain quiet where I am, and ſit compoſed under the frown of <hi>virtue without temptation.</hi> I will bear the thought of even ſeeing again the Marquis. I will do any thing you would have me, if you will ſtill

               <head>LETTER XLVII. Captain CARLISLE to Mr. LASCELLES.</head>
               <p>MY dilemma is even greater than before. The incloſed, from Mr. DE GREY, is even more perplexing than that which you tranſmitted from the Marchioneſs. Both perplex my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, in what manner to anſwer them. Mr. DE GREY'S reaſon for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the ſtate of my affections, is, evidently, for fear my return to Prudence Place, (now that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in the full bloom of her ſenſe and beauty there) ſhould inſpire me with a paſſion that, he knows, would terminate in deſpair; appriſed too as he is of her engagement to Mr. MEDWAY.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0147101501:204"/>It is very natural for him to imagine I ſhould fall into this charming tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that this is a little generous ſtratagem (under the guiſe of ordinary curioſity) to prevent the mortification, and the miſery in time. Mr. MEDWAY is ſo ſingular a man, that, if he did not conſtantly aſſure me almoſt every time he ſees me, that his paſſion runs before the wind, I ſhould ſcarce credit, that a perſon whom I hardly ever ſaw ſpeak to Miſs DE GREY, ſhould have made ſuch a progreſs in her affections. It is plain, however, now from her <hi>own</hi> conduct, that ſhe is fervently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached; for her addreſs, air, manner, and whole deportment to me, are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed. I am no longer delighted by that lovely affability, which, though playful, was ever corrected by modeſty. She no longer conſults my taſte, which ſhe was wont to flatter, about her
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0147101501:205"/>dreſs, her ornaments, and ten thouſand innocent trifles, that, nevertheleſs, (tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles as they are) make up the chief en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment of domeſtic ſociety. She ſpeaks in form; her eye is averted; her ſentiments ſound <hi>ſtudied.</hi> We are no longer like CLEMENT and LUCIA, who employed their infant cares in rearing the <hi>ſame bower.</hi> Mr. DE GREY'S letter therefore, joined to Mr. MEDWAY'S aſſurances, and Miſs DE GREY'S beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour point out to me, pretty plainly, what kind of an anſwer it is proper for me to make to the former. I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what conſoled to reflect, that, even in my moſt familiar moments, I never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered flatly into overtures with LUCIA, ſo that I cannot create any uneaſineſs in her boſom upon my account; for, had that been the caſe, her ſenſibility is ſo uncommon, LASCELLES, ſhe would have felt for <hi>my</hi> diſappointment, amidſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0147101501:206"/>all the gaity of her own ſucceſſes. Since <hi>her</hi> heart is happily engaged (if ſhe <hi>thinks</hi> it ſo, it certainly <hi>is</hi> ſo) it now becomes a duty, more than ever, in me, to <hi>conceal</hi> the feelings of <hi>mine.</hi> Whatever be the violence of my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it has no right to be troubleſome to any other boſom: and I was never able to account for that cowardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which induces us to embitter the joy of a rival and a miſtreſs becauſe they were more fortunate or happy than ourſelves. Beſide, that ſuch complaints never awaken more than compaſſion which is not deſirable, they aggravate diſappointment till it ruſhes upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. But, methinks I hear you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort upon me: "Why trouble <hi>me</hi> with your miſery then, CLEMENT?" Ah LASCELLES, we are not ſuch abſtracted beings as to lock up our ſentiments, either of joy or ſorrow, in abſolute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. The very thoughts would ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0147101501:207"/>by ſuch means. On ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous breaſt every man muſt, by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gravitation of his nature, lean for ſupport in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Mr. LASCELLES, what hourly occaſion is there for one or other of theſe bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings! As joys and ſorrows alternately prevail, how ſoothing is the congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating hand and chearful voice to the one! and the gentle tear, or ſympathiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſigh to the other! Ah enchanting
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0147101501:208"/>communication! without which, even tranſport muſt lie languiſhing at the heart! and in <hi>misfortune</hi> the wretch who is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his ſpecies, and ſits looſe to the kindneſs of an individual, ſhall, like a wounded deer, lament his diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without pity, and die forlorn.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the Marchioneſs, I am every way ſo circumſtanced that I am puzzled even to reply to her. It would be too much like affectation, and a kind of male prudery in me to ſay, that, if matters were in another channel, I ſhould not be flattered by this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing tide of tenderneſs in ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an object. Heaven knows I am not <hi>inſenſible</hi> to the charms of beauty. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that at this moment preſſes hard upon my heart, convinces me I am not. But ſituated as I am, how is it poſſible to receive ſuch a letter as her laſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0147101501:209"/>diſtreſs? Believe me, LASCELLES, I feel no elation at the compliment of ſo diſtinguiſhed a preference, although I acknowledge the Marchioneſs to be as you ſay, with your favourite Yorick, "amongſt the firſt order of fine forms." I acknowledge too her command over the paſſions: her fire; her eloquence; the delicacy of her ſhape; the dignity of her deportment: yet, I feel nothing but anxiety at her preſent conduct. The reaſon you will ſay, is, my ſecret attachment to <hi>another.</hi> Be it ſo. Yet, were even that barrier removed, I ſhould, I am poſitive, ſtill be unhappy, and not flattered, by the attentions of the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marchioneſs. You are an animated man, and no doubt call me a cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blooded creature! By no means. My paſſions are as lively as they generally are in <hi>any</hi> boſom at my age, but, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, my <hi>taſte of voluptuouſneſs</hi> differs a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0147101501:210"/>little from the general juvenile idea. I have a great pleaſure in pleaſing <hi>my own mind:</hi> nay, I have a great <hi>intereſt</hi> in ſo doing; whenever I have done wrong, I have always found that the pain reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, is too heavy to be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanced by the pleaſure which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it. I have my wayward propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities as well as another: a whim hath often ſeized me by the heart, and I have at all events indulged it. For <hi>the time,</hi> it was extaſy, and, for ought I can tell, the extaſy was heightened by a ſenſe of the <hi>venture</hi> at which the deed was done. Preſently (and indeed cloſe upon the heel of it) comes the <hi>per con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> of the action, if you will ſuffer me to borrow a term from trade. My frolic being over, memory is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a power we cannot reſiſt, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trace</hi> it; and if in going through the mazes of the paſt I met any thing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0147101501:211"/>wrong, or uneven, againſt the cauſe of that integrity which I profeſs to love, the thorns are from that moment in my boſom, and for ſo much mirth, I am rewarded ſeven-fold in miſery. I am ſo conſtructed that I can no more ſtand againſt the rebuff of a bluſh on my own cheek than againſt the thunder of a cannon: the ſigh which my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may at any time have extorted from another boſom, agonizes my own; and a tear, which I once, very unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly, drew from an innocent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, haunts me from place to place, and the precious drop, for it was wrung from the eyes of <hi>Lucia,</hi> is ſtill trembling in my imagination.</p>
               <p>I have enlarged upon this ſubject, becauſe my behaviour might want (to your fancy) an apology. That people do not all act on the ſame principle, is,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0147101501:212"/>becauſe they do not all analyze the real cauſe of that anguiſh which ſo often treads upon pleaſure. There is, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, one ſimple law, that comprizes all the wiſdom of the prophets, and all the ſagacity of philoſophers: I feel it better than I can deſcribe it; but to give you ſome idea of it, I ſhall juſt lay it down as a note, that, whenever a man is upon the edge of an enjoyment, (let it relate to whatever part of indulgence it may) he has only to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will not, ſooner or latter, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by <hi>more</hi> than an equal miſery: if, however, even the proſpect of <hi>greater pain</hi> does not deter, let him hazard the joy: then while the <hi>actual agony</hi> is full upon him, let him again compare the <hi>actual pleaſure:</hi> after this, his heart muſt be very perverſe, and his head very much intoxicated, if for the future his pleaſures are not ſuch as will not
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0147101501:213"/>
                  <hi>burt</hi> him after they are over. Innocent pleaſures are, indeed, <hi>never</hi> over: they ſpring directly from the ſoul; and like that, they are immortal. Like mercy too, they are "twice bleſt:" they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light us while they are acting, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience makes them ſacred in reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It is upon this principle I am pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with regard to AUGUSTA. She is the wife of a man to whom I had the honour to tender what he reckoned an obligation. This makes his property more eſpecially ſacred to me. She is, alſo, the wife of a man whom, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the roughneſs of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I believe to be valuable. She is <hi>in truſt</hi>—In ſhort ſhe is every thing that ſhe ſhould <hi>not be</hi> to make a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of; and as I told you before, my <hi>taſte of voluptuouſneſs</hi> muſt have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0147101501:214"/>circumſtances wholly inverted — that is to ſay—ſhe muſt be unmarried, and <hi>averſe</hi> to marriage; unconnected, and unclaimed in the way of connexion, and I, unattached too—before I could congratulate myſelf upon the conqueſt of this flower of Italy.</p>
               <p>Yet, till the Marquis comes, for Heaven's ſake uſe every method to ſoothe, and quiet her: do not adviſe your ſiſter to oppoſe her in the heat of her ſentiments. She is too furious for admonition. Her imagination is too much in its hey dey. Her paſſions will die of themſelves; and ſhe will conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate perhaps, after all, into a regular character. Her ſituation with you is ſo very delicate, that I know your ſiſter is in a dilemma; but ſtill, AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUSTA has many virtues. I have ſeen a thouſand inſtances of her benevolence:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0147101501:215"/>the Italian peaſants bleſs her door, and kiſs the very threſhold of it, becauſe imprinted by her footſteps. She is at this time under the influence of <hi>Fancy;</hi> it is a ſort of feveriſh fit that attacks ſmartly at firſt, and will away again. The handſome creature is but juſt touching nineteen. She is a child, my dear LASCELLES, and this truant diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is a trick of the leading ſtring: without parents and of a vigorous ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, ſhe is yet, as to human life, in the nurſery. No more, my friend— think not of her as of one abandoned: that is not the caſe. As to her glowing language, let not that diſpleaſe your ſiſter, though unaccuſtomed to her ear. The Italian women know nothing of that reſerve and pathetic baſhfulneſs, which guards the expreſſions of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh fair. They ſpeak freely and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly—the Marchioneſs adds to the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0147101501:216"/>cuſtom, even the ardours of <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But, indeed, ſhe is not a baſe character—Once it is ſaid the Marquis in his violence ſtruck her. Her pride was hurt. She thought it beneath the dignity of the man who had figured at the front of an army—ſhe never forgave it—'twas wrong. But who hath not a fault to be forgiven? Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. I have written myſelf into ſome compoſure, and that will plead my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for having ſo long intruded.</p>

My father whiſpered, as I ſat at dinner yeſterday, that he had a little private converſation for me, and would contrive an opportunity very ſoon to chat with me. You know his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of treating his children, CARO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINE. Towards the cloſe of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (when Lord and Lady BLESSING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOURNE were airing, Mrs. HEWSON at her looking-glaſs, where ſhe is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing breeding, Mr. MEDWAY at the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0147101501:218"/>river with his fiſhing-rod, and Mr. CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE at his writing-deſk) we found the leiſure we wanted, and walked into the garden together. We will ſettle a little while in this very bower, my dear, ſays my father: 'tis as pretty and cooling as any in the garden.</p>
               <p>Oh, CAROLINE, it was the bower of CLEMENT and LUCIA!</p>
               <p>Yes, Sir, replied I; it is very pretty and cooling, indeed.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, LUCIA, your fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer who helped to make it has not paid it a viſit ſince his return. Such humble ſhades muſt yield to the ſpices of Italy. He has, to be ſure, forgot an arbour of mere Engliſh hawthorns and woodbines.</p>
               <p>I — I — believe he has, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0147101501:219"/>
A-propos, LUCIA, do you hold in the ſame mind ſtill? Do you ſtill think him the <hi>incomparable</hi> CARLISLE? Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Place can boaſt juſt at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>ſeveral</hi> brilliant men. We have the laughter-loving Sir ANDREW, of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable perſon. We have the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mr. MEDWAY, odd, but amiable. Putting theſe both againſt Mr. CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE, is he ſtill the <hi>ſuperlative</hi> degree? There are two to one LUCIA. What ſay you?</p>
               <p>I believe they have all their merit, Sir.</p>
               <p>But is their merit perfectly equal in <hi>your</hi> opinion, my dear?</p>
               <p>As to that, Sir, I—ſhould ſuppoſe— no doubt—that is—in ſhort, Sir, as I have not known them all the ſame time—
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0147101501:220"/>as one can judge more of intimates than caſual acquaintances—</p>
               <p>You prefer CLEMENT, I ſuppoſe?</p>
               <p>I have known him the longeſt, Sir.</p>
               <p>MEDWAY, my dear, has great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions.</p>
               <p>Sir?</p>
               <p>Sir ANDREW has good humour, and will be heir to Lord BLESSINGBOURNE.</p>
               <p>Sir —?</p>
               <p>But CARLISLE is the more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed gentleman.</p>
               <p>Moſt certainly he is, Sir, <hi>beyond compariſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0147101501:221"/>
Do you think <hi>beyond compariſon,</hi> LU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIA?</p>
               <p>Sir—?</p>
               <p>I ſay, my dear LUCIA, do you real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think—that—that?</p>
               <p>Bleſs me, Sir, how faint the air gets when the breeze falls, at this ſeaſon of the year—</p>
               <p>Yonder comes GEOFFRY.</p>
               <p>From Mr. CARLISLE; perhaps upon private buſineſs—I will, if you pleaſe, withdraw, Sir.</p>
               <p>If the heat is troubleſome, pray do, my dear.</p>
               <p>Very troubleſome, indeed, Sir—Lord bleſs me! there is not a breath of wind.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0147101501:222"/>As ſure as can be, there is a tempeſt in the ſkies.</p>
               <p>Thus ended our dialogue—What does it mean, CAROLINE? I never was more confuſed in my life. What could old GEOFFRY be coming for? The old fellow, who only wiſhes himſelf young again to diſpatch with more haſte the commands of his maſter, quite ran on the occaſion.</p>
               <p>On my return into the houſe, I met Mr. MEDWAY with an handkerchief full of fiſh, and in the higheſt degree pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his ſucceſs. By way of courteſy <hi>en paſſant,</hi> I told him, he muſt certainly carry a <hi>charm</hi> about him to attract ſo many fiſh out of the water in ſo little a time. Upon which he caught hold of my wriſt, and, after looking round the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0147101501:223"/>room to ſee if any body was preſent— huſh—huſh—for God's ſake, child— walls have eyes—and worms have ears, as I always told you.</p>
               <p>From this, and ſome other ſtrange things, I have ſeen in this man, I am convinced his head is not exactly as it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Not a view of CARLISLE all this morning ſince breakfaſt. No ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſing, to touch the guittar, to walk in the garden, to count the fruit, to read Pope, to—to—to—</p>
               <p>It is very barbarous he ſhould all at once take ſuch a diſlike to me!</p>
               <p>I wiſh Italy had been far enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ſeen it. Pray, my dear,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0147101501:224"/>are the ladies ſo <hi>very</hi> beautiful in that country? Towards <hi>Rome</hi> for inſtance! I have been looking into my father's library for a ſort of <hi>hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>manners</hi> of that country. Not, indeed, that I am concerned in the matter; but yet, if any thing of this kind happens to fall in your way, you may purchaſe and ſend it me by the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</p>

               <p>WE got, without miſchance, to the Abbey. I beg to know whether you have conſidered the ſubject we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed upon. Sir ANDREW is no mean match, Mr. DE GREY. He will, one day, be Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE, for which change of his name, I have a peremptory command in my Will. If you ſend me word <hi>you</hi> are ſatisfied as to the matter, I will tranſmit directions for him to think more <hi>particularly</hi> of the young Lady, whoſe good qualities
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0147101501:227"/>my Lady and I have determined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ourſelves to be equivalent to want of title, and that is certainly ſaying a great deal. Sir ANDREW is worthy, though he is too great a laugher, and he will make a good huſband. Your offer of forty thouſand pounds with Miſs DE GREY is liberal: half that with a coronet would be ſufficient. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if there are honours on one ſide, it reflects dignity on both. If ſhe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Sir ANDREW ſhe ſtands a chance of being a Counteſs; to which brilliant probability I will add the fellow ſum to your's down, two thouſand pounds worth of diamonds; a thouſand pounds for a wedding dinner, and the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt ſet of cream-colours, with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trappings, and the BLESSINGBOURNE creſt engraven thereon. I have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <head>LETTER LI. Mr. LASCELLES to Captain CARLISLE.</head>
               <p>HOW pitiable it is, my dear CARLISLE, that you ſhould be ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced as to find it utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to return the extatic fondneſs of this bewitching woman! She is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely an angel. Some new dreſſes have lately been put on, and ſhe ſets them off with ſuch an elegance, ſuch a taſte, ſuch a <hi>naiveté,</hi> it is impoſſible to look at her without an ejaculation of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and admiration. Allowing all your arguments their full force, I muſt ſtill confeſs, there is a ſomething cold and icy about <hi>your</hi> heart, that cannot be
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0147101501:233"/>melted by ſuch a blaze of beauty—eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as the lady is ſo perfectly <hi>will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and not at all unreaſonably <hi>nice.</hi> She loves your perſon well enough to take it on <hi>your own terms:</hi> ſhe does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to capitulate: the citadel is your own, and you may do what <hi>you will</hi> with it. Oh—ſaid ſhe, the other day (while the tears were ſtreaming from her lovely eyes)—oh, that I could ſee him but <hi>one</hi> moment in <hi>every</hi> day, I would be content with annihilation for the reſt of the twenty-four hours. By Heavens, CARLISLE, if any woman half ſo beautiful had avowed ſuch a ſentiment in <hi>my</hi> favour, I would have ſhewn my gratitude for it at the price of my exiſtence—but you, on the contrary, though as virtuous as a ſaint, are as frigid as a Freezelander. I queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether you ever approached the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0147101501:234"/>lips of this lovely one ſince they firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a paſſion for you. It requires, I confeſs, all the elaborate excuſes you have made, to wipe off the imputation of an inſenſible; and even after all your pains, I freely tell you, that I think you are too ſcrupulous upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I ſpeak frankly, out of pity to the Marchioneſs, and for <hi>your pleaſure.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting your paſſion for Miſs DE GREY to be ever ſo great, what, I wonder, has <hi>that</hi> to do with a ſnug convenient beauty, by way of, <hi>my friend in a corner,</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarter of the world? Your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are abſolutely antediluvian. I do not know another man in the world, who would not <hi>leap</hi> at your ſituation. In the name of pleaſure then, make the beſt of it! I thought at firſt as you do, but I ſpeak now upon mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration. There is no doubt but the Marchioneſs would change her name,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0147101501:235"/>live quietly in the place you provide for her, be happy as if in Heaven to get a ſight of you once a fortnight, and there would be an end of the thing. Do then, let me adviſe you, put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to theſe complaints; open the cage of the beautiful priſoner, and ſet the pretty little heart, that is now beating as it were at the wires till it pants again, perfectly at eaſe. It is with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty I keep her from writing to you every day. The idea of the Marquis ſets her already raving; but I cannot by any means draw from her, nor can my ſiſter, any account of her family, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be in town. She ſays, they would force her again to the arms of the deteſted Marquis. But I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a proper ſalvo for all thoſe ſores, and, if you have the leaſt lively ſpark of the young man, or of merry human
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0147101501:236"/>nature in you, you will not neglect it. Compliments to our friend Sir ANDREW.</p>

               <head>LETTER LII. Captain CARLISLE to G. LASCELLES, Eſq.</head>
               <p>YOUR letter has not been an hour in my hand, and, although my heart was full of <hi>other</hi> matter, I have now neither ear nor pen for any thing but an anſwer to it. Do you know, in the firſt place, that I looked at your ſeal, and at your ſuperſcription, and at the very <hi>cut of your letters,</hi> before I would credit the thing to be your's? In this age of <hi>forgery,</hi> I was in good hope, ſomebody had made free with my friend. But as it appears that the letter did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely proceed from <hi>you, I</hi> muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an explicit reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0147101501:238"/>
Make a proſtitute of the poor girl, Mr. LASCELLES? Seek out a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient apartment, and compel the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes, which you ſay <hi>now</hi> weep with love, grow wild with the ſparklings of rage and deſpair? What, Sir, would you wiſh me to ſeclude her from all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable ſociety, and to ſink her from a Marchioneſs of the firſt figure and faſhion, to a mere miſtreſs—from a young, elegant woman, to a ſcorned, abandoned daughter of the brothel! Is this the method in which you would have me return my compliment, for a long, a weary, an hapleſs, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate journey of a thouſand miles? However miſplaced the affection ſhe is pleaſed to beſtow upon me, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever impoſſible it is for me to reward it, I am ſtill bound to her even for her very misfortune. It is my <hi>fate,</hi> and not <hi>me,</hi> that declines what, in ſome
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0147101501:239"/>caſes, might have been my greateſt bleſſing. Surely, Mr. LASCELLES, I owe her gratitude of a very different complexion from that bluſhleſs one, you recommend. My heart bleeds for her. From <hi>me</hi> ſhe ſhould claim an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive anxiety how to <hi>recompenſe</hi> the throbbings in her boſom; the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious care to reconcile her again to her huſband, to contrive means of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up any breach, which my unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate acquaintance with that gentleman may have occaſioned. Theſe are the ſervices ſhe ſhould expect from me, and to offer theſe is at once my ſtudy, and my effort. But I will not believe you ſerious; or, if you are, your compaſſion has hurried you into a precipitancy, that only wants ſhewing you, to be repented of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0147101501:240"/>
This, my dear LASCELLES, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly the caſe. Beſides which, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, you have <hi>miſtaken</hi> the Marchioneſs. She could not ſtoop to the ignominious terms you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to me for her. If ſhe <hi>really</hi> loves, there muſt be ſome degree of refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the partiality; and believe me, LASCELLES, many a woman has felt a ſecret predilection in favour of a man, who would ſtart with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror from an act of <hi>predetermined</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy. If it were not for the appearance of an implied compliment to <hi>myſelf,</hi> I ſhould not at all ſcruple to ſay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, any partiality, AUGUSTA may have, unluckily, conceived in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, proceeds, wholly, from ſome imaginary <hi>virtues</hi> which ſhe is pleaſed to think I poſſeſs. I dare ſwear ſhe is taken by certain qualities in your friend, which (as <hi>ſhe</hi> has enriched and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0147101501:241"/>them) appear to <hi>her</hi> deſerving eſteem. Upon <hi>this</hi> principle, you have, indeed, propoſed an <hi>effectual plan</hi> for making her <hi>deteſt</hi> me. To diſcolour the image ſhe has flatteringly dreſſed up, by placing in its ſtead a ſeducer and ingrate, might perhaps prove a ſucceſſful remedy: but this, my dear LASCELLES, would be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing averſion more fatally than any thing that can reaſonably ariſe out of the partiality itſelf. No, no, my friend.</p>
