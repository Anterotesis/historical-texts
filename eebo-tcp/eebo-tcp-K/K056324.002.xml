            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <note place="margin">Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> WILLIAM had obtained the crown, through the folly of his predeceſſor. He was now in danger of loſing it, by his own negligence. Diſappointments in their views, had eſtranged from him the minds of the Whigs. He diſguſted the Tories with the coldneſs of his manner, even when he diſtinguiſhed them moſt with his favour. The diſſolution of the convention-parliament, had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0709200302:13"/>
the influence of the former, to a degree that offended their pride. They ſaw a Prince, who had aſcended the throne upon their own principles, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf into the hands of their political oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, from an avowed affection for thoſe prerogatives which he was called to circumſcribe. The ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which deprived the King of the attachment of his firſt friends in England, deſtroyed his intereſt with the party which had accompliſhed the revolution in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. In both kingdoms, the ſeeds of diſcontent had been ſown with a laviſh hand; and they gradually roſe to maturity, in the progreſs of events. The people in general, inflamed by diſappointment, miſled by deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, or from levity, fond of change, began to ſhow a manifeſt diſlike to the behaviour of the King, and the meaſures of the crown. They became jealous of foreigners. They complained of an expenſive war, where victory itſelf could produce no advantage to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. They murmured againſt a ſtanding army. They repined at the little uſe made of the navy, the great and natural bulwark of England.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</note> Though the enemies of William exaggerated his miſmanagements, it muſt be allowed, that men who judged of cauſes by events, had juſt reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. The expences of England, from the landing of the Prince of Orange, on the fith of November 1688, to the twenty-ninth of September 1691, had amounted to near eighteen millions<note n="A" place="bottom">MS. 1691. Journals paſſim.</note>. Beſides, great arrears were owing to the army in Ireland, the navy was deſtitute of ſtores, and the ſhips were out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. The ſervice done in the intermediate time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the change made in the perſon of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, was far from being adequate to that enormous ſum. The war in Ireland had been at firſt ſtrangely neglected. It was afterwards proſecuted with little judgment, and it terminated in no honour. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of a few pariſhes in the Highlands of Scotland, without any aid from abroad, and deſtitute of the means of war at home, remained in arms againſt the King, for more than two years. They had once to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally defeated his army in the field. The checks which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0709200302:14"/>
they had received, were neither ſplendid nor deciſive; and he owed the pacification which enſued, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his rival, and his own money<note n="B" place="bottom">MS. 1691.</note>, and not to the terror of his power. England had been, in the mean time, wounded in her pride. Her fleet had been twice defeated. Her enemy rode in triumph in the channel. Her coaſts were inſulted. She was left naked of troops, and expoſed to invaſion<note n="C" place="bottom">Nottingham to William, 1690.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues</note> But William ought not, in common fairneſs, to be blamed for all theſe misfortunes. He reigned over a divided people. His title was diſputed by one party. He loſt the other, by not yielding to their claims upon his excluſive favour. His rival, in the mean time, ſupported by a powerful Monarch, either maintained war againſt him, within his kingdoms, or hovered over the coaſt, with threatened invaſions. Deprived by his unhappy manner, and avowed attachment to foreigners, of the affection of the Engliſh, he had no friends among his ſervants. His councils were betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his orders neglected, his perſon hated, his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity deſpiſed<note n="D" place="bottom">Intell. from England. MS. 1691.</note>. His only ſafety lay ultimately in the folly of his enemies; and that invincible averſion to the French nation, which the people of England had derived from their anceſtors. James had ſcarce land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in France, when many of thoſe, by whoſe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had loſt his throne, began ſecretly to favour his return. Men, who apparently had the chief hand in the revolution, admitted his agents into conferences, and encouraged their hopes<note n="E" place="bottom">Rcreſby.</note>. The unprepared ſtate of France, in the beginning of the year 1689, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an immediate invaſion of England impracticable; James, contrary to his own opinion<note n="F" place="bottom">Mem. to Lewis, MS. 1689.</note>, was induced to ſail to Ireland. He knew that it was impoſſible to hold that exhauſted kingdom, againſt the wealth and power of the Engliſh nation. To render his rival uneaſy in the poſſeſſion of his throne, and to furniſh France with an opportunity of aiding him with effect in England, was all that he expected from his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="G" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">with the Whigs.</note> While James was on the worſt terms with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſect, the Catholics of Ireland, William, by the coldneſs of his manner, and his exertion of the prerogative, loſt his influence with the Whigs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scotland. Diſcontented friends are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt dangerous enemies. A plot was formed in Scotland, by the Preſbyterians, in favour of James. Many of the Whigs in England were privy to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, which threatened the ſubverſion of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer principles. In both kingdoms, thoſe inferior agents of the party, who had ruined the late King, were now buſy in procuring his reſtoration. Sir John Cochran, Ferguſon, Wildman engaged themſelves deeply with James<note n="H" place="bottom">Caermarthen to William, June 13, 1690.</note> The leaders of the party, though they had not avowedly eſpouſed the cauſe of that Prince, became very indifferent concerning the fate of William. The very ſecrets of the cabinet were ſaid to have been betrayed, by the Earl of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth to Wildman; and by the latter to the late King<note n="I" place="bottom">Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to William, 1690.</note> The Duke of Bolton, the Marquis of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, the Earl of Devonſhire, the Lord Montague were ſuſpected<note n="K" place="bottom">Caermarthen to William, 1690.</note> The party in general made no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of their diſappointment, in the Prince whom they had raiſed to the throne.

                  <note place="margin">James gains many friends.</note> The retreat of James from Ireland, though unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, precipitate and weak, neither leſſened his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence nor increaſed the intereſt of William. The To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, urged by their principles, favoured the former. The Whigs, ſwayed by their reſentment, ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued adverſe to the latter. The agents of James were, in the mean time, extremely active. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels Bulkely and Sackville ſounded the Marquis of Halifax and the Lord Godolphin. The Earl of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, inflamed by recent injuries from William, and, perhaps, remembering his former obligations to James, began, as ſhall hereafter appear, to correſpond
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0709200302:16"/>
with the latter. Admiral Ruſſel, diſappointed in his own private views, as well as in his public expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from William, entered into the cabals, in favour of the late King. The Marquis of Caermarthen, in all his avowed zeal for the revolution, liſtened, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to propoſals for the reſtoration of James<note n="M" place="bottom">Dalrymple's Appen. and MS. 1691.</note>. While the great offered their ſervice to the late King, that Prince neglected not to ſupport his intereſt with conſpiracies among the inferior ranks. He correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Ferguſon. He informed him of his intentions. He aſked his advice<note n="N" place="bottom">Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to G. H. MS. 1691.</note>. A party was formed in the city in his favour. The Tower was to have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized. The guards were to be attacked, on the firſt news of his landing. The perſons of William and Mary were to be ſeized<note n="O" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their views</note> The affairs of James wore a like favourable aſpect in Scotland, toward the end of the preceding year. The ceſſation of arms made by Breadalbin with the Highlanders, had been begun and finiſhed by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. His firm friend the Earl of Arran had promiſed <q rend="inline">"body for body,"</q> to uſe his own expreſſion, for the Earl of Argyle and the Marquis of Athol. The High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers were again prepared to take the field. Ten thouſand men, under the Duke of Berwick and the Earl of Dumbarton, were to have been ſent to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The Marquis of Athol, the Earls of Argyle and Home, were to have received commiſſions, as lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-generals, from James. The intrigues of James extended, in England, to the projected meaſures of parliament, and even to the very appointment of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's ſervants. The delay, at firſt, in granting the ſupply, the facility with which it was afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, proceeded from the ſecret machinations of the late King's friends. Some of them wiſhed to leave the kingdom naked to an invaſion, by refuſing money. Others to vote the exciſe, that their old maſter might enjoy the benefit, without the odium, of that unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular tax. Under the maſk of patriotiſm, they propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attack his enemies. The Biſhops of Saliſbury
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0709200302:17"/>
and St. Aſaph were to be impeached, for perſuading the clergy to take the oaths to William, as a conqueror. The Marquis of Caermarthen, though he might not obſtruct a reſtoration, was not, from his temporizing character, to be truſted. He was, therefore, to be terrified from office by an impeachment, for declaring that no King could reign in England, as long as the act of <hi>habeas corpus</hi> ſhould remain in force. The choice of his ſucceſſor, as miniſter, was left to James; and the conteſt, for preference, lay between the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Halifax and the Earl of Rocheſter<note n="P" place="bottom">Ferguſon's Memorial, MS. Oct. 1691.</note>. To keep alive the ſpirit of diſcontent in the kingdom, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon employed, for King James, that very private preſs, with which he had, ſome years before, ſo much annoyed the Duke of York<note n="Q" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and Ruſſel.</note> Though the Whigs, by their leaders, and the moſt of the Tories, in their own names, had made engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the late King, he relied chiefly upon Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough and Ruſſel. Marlborough had aſked, in the moſt abject terms, and obtained forgiveneſs for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conduct, from James and his Queen<note n="R" place="bottom">Jan. 10th, 1691.</note>. He even became an agent for that Prince. He gained the Earl of Shrewſbury. He tampered with Caermarthen. He promiſed to bring back the Princeſs of Denmark to her duty to her father<note n="S" place="bottom">May 20th, 1691.</note>. He undertook, in ſome degree, for the army. He requeſted James to invade England, with twenty thouſand men. Though he was not truſted by James, he was, perhaps, ſincere in his profeſſions, and he effected what he promiſed. The Princeſs of Denmark, gained by his ſolicitations, warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a returning affection for her father, or urged by reſentment for perſonal injuries received from Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam and her ſiſter, made her peace with the late King. She wrote to him a letter full of contrition<note n="T" place="bottom">Dec. 10th, 1691.</note>. She aſked his forgiveneſs, and promiſed to join him whenever he ſhould land in England<note n="U" place="bottom">Dec. 1691.</note>. Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, judging it vain to corrupt the captains of men of war, as they durſt not communicate the ſecret to the ſailors, was the perſon who adviſed James to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0709200302:18"/>
accept of the ſervices of Ruſſel<note n="V" place="bottom">Marlborough's Meſſage, MS. 1694. James II. 1692.</note>. To avoid an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the French fleet, ſhould they fall in his way, would have been impoſſible. But it always was in the admiral's power to carry the fleet from the courſe held by the enemy, under the ſpecious pretence of orders. The conſpiracy was ſo great and general, that William ſeemed to have no friend to apprize him of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Though he diſmiſſed the earl of Marlborough from all his employments, in the month of January, though he diſgraced and deprived of her guards the Princeſs of Denmark, his reſentment ſeems to have rather proceeded from a renewal of private quarrels, than from any diſcovery of their ſecret negociations with the court of St. Germains.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Intrigues of James in England.</note> James himſelf had taken all the precautions, which prudence or the advice of his friends could ſuggeſt, to render his return agreeable to the nation. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to awaken the feelings of his former ſubjects, with a detail of the injuſtice of his rival and his own misfortunes. He hoped to rouze their reſentment, by repreſenting, in a ſtrong light their grievances. He dwelt, in his propoſed declaration, on the tyranny of foreigners. He reminded the people of the enormous expences of government, the weight of taxes, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of William, his glaring partiality to his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the Dutch. He yielded to all the requiſitions of the Whigs in favour of the ſubject. He ſatisfied the church of England, with regard to religion. The non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurors were his determined friends. The clergy who had taken the oaths offered to return to their allegiance, and they were, with chearfulneſs, received. To ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the world that the Proteſtant religion was in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, five hundred clergymen had engaged to join the late King upon his landing; and to attend him in his progreſs to preach to the people. The deprived biſhops, the moſt of thoſe prelates, who had temporized with William, by taking the oaths, were buſy in inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon the inferior clergy, the propriety of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Project of an invaſion.</note> Encouraged by favourable accounts from Britain, and eager to turn the ſcale of the war, by placing that kingdom in the hands of a friend, Lewis the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth began to think ſeriouſly of an invaſion. James poſſeſſed of his native ſubjects an army almoſt equal to the purpoſe of the expedition. The tranſports which had carried to Ireland five thouſand French, in the year 1690, had brought back to France as many Iriſh. The Engliſh government had been at the expence of ſending fourteen thouſand more troops to James, after the capitulation of Limeric. Lewis promiſed to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to Britain ten thouſand of this army, with a like number of French troops, under the convoy of his whole fleet, early in the year 1692. He began, in the month of January, to equip ſquadrons of men of war, at Toulon, Breſt, Rochfort, and Port-Lewis. An embargo was laid upon all merchantmen. All pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers were recalled to man the fleet. An army, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mareſchal de Bellefons, filed off toward the coaſt of Normandy. Tranſports were prepared. James had concerted his meaſures with his friends in England. He had ſettled his conceſſions to the nation. To ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Earl of Marlborough, already in diſgrace, from the further reſentment of William, he agreed, at his own requeſt, to except that nobleman from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in his projected declaration to his people<note n="X" place="bottom">Stuart papers, 1692.

                  <note place="margin">Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam.</note> Though ſo many perſons were privy to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of James, though every channel of intelligence brought news of the preparations of France, William was ſtill a ſtranger to his own danger. He, however, made all neceſſary preparations for manning the fleet. Preſs-warrants continued to be executed, throughout the month of February. All ſailors fit for ſervice, were forced to enter on board the navy. The utmoſt expedition was uſed in the docks and yards. In the firſt week of March, all the ſhips of force had come round from Portſmouth. Many had fallen down from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0709200302:20"/>
Deptford, Woolwich, and Chatham, to the Nore. William, upon his arrival in Holland, haſtened the Dutch fleet to ſea. The Amſterdam, the Maeſe, the North-Holland, the Zealand ſquadrons were ordered to proceed ſucceſſively to the Downs. The combined fleets formed a greater naval force than had ever covered the ſea. They conſiſted of ninety ſhips of the line, with many frigates and fire-ſhips. They carried more than forty thouſand men, with near ſix thouſand guns. Ruſſel, in the Britannia, a firſt rate, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in chief the whole. He reſolved to adhere to his engagements with James. But time and accident broke through all his deſigns<note n="Y" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1692.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">James ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at La Hogue.</note> The late King had concerted with his friends in England, that the French fleet ſhould ſail early in the year. Had the preparations of Lewis anſwered his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, he propoſed to put to ſea in the middle of March. He, however, left not St. Germains until the eleventh of April. He had, even then, ſufficient time to carry his army to England, before the junction of Ruſſel with the Dutch-fleet. Beſides that officer continued his correſpondence, and aſſured him of his firm intention to ſerve his cauſe. He propoſed one of two alternatives. That James ſhould ſuſpend his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition till winter; or that he himſelf ſhould, under the pretence of making a deſcent on the coaſt of France, permit the French fleet to paſs. He accordingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but in vain, to the court of England, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to attack St. Maloes. He adviſed James, by all means, to prevent the meeting of the fleets. None of his officers was truſted with the ſecret; and he would, therefore, find himſelf under a neceſſity to fight. A contrary wind, which blew inceſſantly for four weeks, hindered the French from ſailing, and prevented James from conveying his inſtructions to Ruſſel. The Toulon ſquadron was kept, by the ſame adverſe wind, from paſſing the Streights. Tourville, with the Breſt ſquadron, was, after repeated efforts, driven back to his port. During this interval, the Dutch joined the Engliſh in the Downs<note n="Z" place="bottom">May 8.</note>. Ruſſel proceeded immediately to St. Helens, and ordered
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0709200302:21"/>
two ſmall ſquadrons, that cruized on the coaſt of France, to join him in that place.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Vigorous meaſures in England.</note> During this time of ſuſpence, the government of England were not remiſs in their duty. Several of the ſervants of the crown were in correſpondence with the late King. But they endeavoured, by a ſhew of ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity againſt him, to prevent every ſuſpicion of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Some imperfect inſinuations of a plot had been carried to William in Flanders. The Earl of Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land arrived, with ſecret inſtructions for the Queen. The Earls of Huntington and Marlborough were ſent to the Tower, with others of leſſer name. A procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was iſſued, for apprehending ſeveral other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of rank, who had abſconded. A camp was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between Petersfield and Portſmouth. Six regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, under orders to embark for Flanders, were countermanded. The lieutenancy were commanded to raiſe the militia. The ſame precautions were uſed in Scotland. But Ireland was left to its fate. Orders were ſent to the fleet to ſail in queſt of the enemy. A declaration, iſſued by James before he left St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, was publiſhed and anſwered, by authority. Activity and ſpirit prevailed every where; and that terror, which commonly precedes danger, was leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the buſtle of preparation<note n="A" place="bottom">Gazettes, 1692.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The fleet ſails toward La Hogue.</note> The communication between France and England was, in the mean time, completely interrupted. James, during all the time he had remained at La Hogue, received no intelligence from his friends in London<note n="B" place="bottom">James II. 1692.</note>. Captain Lloyd, who had been diſpatched to him by his adherents, with an important meſſage, and a letter from the princeſs of Denmark, was detained two months on his way. Tourville, upon a change of wind, ſailed at length from Breſt, with forty-four ſhips of the line. He directed his courſe to La Hogue.

They began on both ſides to form the line. Tourville, who had been irritated by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection thrown on his courage, by de Seignelay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to fight the enemy, though he was not ignorant of their force. He bore down upon the combined fleets at ten of the clock. The Dutch were in the van.

The reſt of the French admiral's diviſion fell in with the Engliſh line. A ſmart engagement enſued. The two commanders plied their guns very warmly, till one of the clock. The weather, during the engagement, fell almoſt calm. Tourville was diſabled. His rigging, ſails, and yards were ſhot. His fire began to ſlacken. He ordered his boats to tow him to windward. Five freſh ſhips of the ſquadron, with a furious fire, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their admiral's retreat. About four of the clock, a thick fog fell on the battle; and the firing ceaſed. At half after five, a ſmall breeze of wind aroſe at Eaſt. The weather cleared up a little. The French were running on every ſide. Ruſſel gave the ſignal for the fleet to chaſe. The fog returned and night came on. The French ſtood to the Weſt, with all their ſails. The breeze was ſo light that little way could be made. The fog continued the greateſt part of the next day. Toward the evening, Ruſſel took in the ſignal for the line of battle; and ordered each ſhip to make the beſt of her way, in purſuit of the enemy.

though a man of too much courage not to fight with ſpirit, owed his ſucceſs more to accident and the folly of his enemies, than his own conduct. Had the Dutch ſhewed the ſame alacrity in fighting, which they had exhibited upon a former occaſion againſt Tourville, the ruin of the French fleet might have been render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed complete. But the hazineſs of the weather; the very fears of the French, upon perceiving themſelves much outnumbered; the conſuſion and want of plan which prevail in all naval engagements, ought to have ſaved the victors from the cenſure which ſome writers have thrown on their conduct. The chief loſs of the French conſiſted in that of their ſhips. Sixteen men of war, between fifty-ſix and one hundred and four guns, were burnt. Twenty tranſports ſhared the ſame fate.

The force of the allies had however been, in ſome degree, diminiſhed, by the intrigues of Lewis the Fourteenth, and miſunderſtandings between themſelves. Diſputes between the Emperor and the Elector of Saxony, had induced the latter to recal his troops to his own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Sweden and Denmark continued their neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Helvetic body diſcovered an inclination to favour the cauſe of France. To ſupply the place of the Saxons, the Emperor and King of England gained the younger branch of the houſe of Lunenburgh to their party. The Dukes of Zell and Hanover, upon the promiſe of an electoral cap, with a certainty of the inveſtiture before the end of the year, undertook to march ſix thouſand troops to join the Imperialiſts, and four thouſand to reinforce the army of the allies in Flanders. The Spaniards had raiſed to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that country, the Elector of Bavaria; a Prince whoſe ſpirit and abilities promiſed to ſupport the feebleneſs of the common cauſe, on that ſide.

The Duke de Luxembourg, one of the beſt generals of the age, had poſted himſelf to great advantage, on the banks of the Mehaigne. The unſeaſonable rains had unexpectedly ſwelled the ſtream, and formed into moraſſes the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining fields.

Though this bloody battle was attended with no material conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, an undiſputed victory remained to the French.

William was not of a complexion to grant demands, ſo contrary to his fixed predilections and views. He refuſed the requeſt of the lords, by anſwering, that he would conſider their addreſs.

The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Halifax and the Earl of Mulgrave induced the houſe, by the force of their eloquence, to ingraft a clauſe on the land-tax bill, that the lords ſhould tax themſelves. The bill was ſent down amended to the commons. The lower houſe flew into the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat. They rejected the amendment, without one diſſenting voice.

They ordered, by a joint vote, that a pamphlet, entitled, <q rend="inline">"King William and Mary conquerors,"</q> ſhould be burnt by the hands of the common hangman. They addreſſed the King to diſmiſs from his place the licenſer of the preſs, under whoſe ſanction it had been printed and publiſhed.

                  <note place="margin">A place-bill rejected by the lords.</note> Though this facility in giving money, has been aſcribed to ſome corrupt practices of the court, it may be juſtified from the urgent ſtate of the times. The people were plunged in a war, from which they could not immediately extricate themſelves, by land, either with honour or with ſafety. To remit in preparations by ſea, might have encouraged an invaſion. The commons, in other reſpects, ſhewed little complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance for the crown. They even appeared to be ſelf-denied, with regard to the private intereſt of their own members. They introduced and paſſed a bill, touching free and impartial proceedings in parliament, which excluded, from the right of ſitting in the houſe, all perſons, who ſhould accept of any office from the crown. The miniſtry found themſelves incapable of oppoſing, in the lower houſe, a meaſure ſo popular. To facilitate the paſſing of this important bill, it was not to be in force till the King ſhould think fit to call a new parliament. It was ſent up to the lords early in the ſeſſion. The malcontents, in the upper houſe, carried the motion in favour of the bill, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. But when it came to be reported, the court party, by the means of proxies, rejected it, by a majority of two votes. The adherents of James were joined with the moſt violent Whigs, upon the preſent occaſion. The firſt wiſhed for confuſion; the latter, by yielding to their reſentment, adhered to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed principles<note n="K" place="bottom">Journals.</note>.</p>
               <p>The oppoſition, in the houſe of lords, were not diſcouraged with the bad ſucceſs of the place-bill. As

The preſent houſe of commons, though refractory on ſome occaſions, had rendered their general conduct grateful to the court. Their oppoſition to the high exertions of the prerogative had never been followed with rigour. They were generous in their ſupplies, and, perhaps, rather profuſe, with regard to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the ſubject. A great majority were Tories, men in general leſs attached to the family of a prince, than to the power of the crown. The Earl of Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham and others of their own party had opened a channel of connexion between them and the reigning King. Sir John Trevor, the ſpeaker, was a ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful agent, in purchaſing the votes of the venal, with money<note n="L" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. iii.</note>. Beſides, in the preſent divided ſtate of the nation, a new election would be at leaſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, if not attended with danger. The oppoſition perceived the views of their enemies, and they were reſolved to purſue their own. The Earl of Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury moved for a bill, providing for triennial parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and annual ſeſſions. It paſſed the houſe of lords.

That kingdom, ever ſince its reduction in 1691, had exhibited one continued ſcene of oppreſſion, injuſtice, and public miſery. The government of James, with all its diſadvantages, his own bigotry, the inſolence of the papiſts, combined with the fears of the proteſtants, were all more tolerable than the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of William, ever ſince the ſurrender of Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. Coningſby and Porter, the lords juſtices, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themſelves odious by a ſeries of frauds, cruelties,

and rapacities. They ſold common juſtice for money. They ſcreened the guilty and oppreſſed the innocent, for gain. To render their proceedings ſummary, to clothe their authority with more terror, and, with moſt expedition, to enrich themſelves, they choſe to exert their power in the military way. The corruption, at the ſource, extended itſelf through every channel of government. The ſubordinate magiſtrates, the juſtices of the peace, as if all law were at an end, made their own will and pleaſure the rule of their conduct. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on their power in the country, they deprived, under the colour of authority, many perſons of their effects; they diſpoſſeſſed many of their lands<note n="N" place="bottom">Printed Proclamation.</note>. The Roman Catholics, as they had leſs to expect from juſtice than the Proteſtants, endeavoured to purchaſe favour. They applied to thoſe in power, through the channel of venality; and thus the party who had been in arms againſt the Revolution, fared better than thoſe who had ſupported the cauſe of William with the moſt zeal, courage, and induſtry<note n="O" place="bottom">Journals, paſſim, 1693.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</note> On the third of March 1692, the Lord Viſcount Sidney was raiſed to the government of Ireland. But he arrived not in that kingdom, till the twenty-fifth of the following Auguſt. Coningſby, created a Baron by the ſame name, with his colleague Porter, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the government, in the intermediate time. They preſided in the court of claims, for adjuſting the demands of thoſe comprehended in the articles of Limerick; and the obvious road to their juſtice, was ſaid to lie through their avarice. The arrival of Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his government, though it might leſſen the fear of future oppreſſions, diminiſhed not the reſentment of the people for former injuries. His own conduct ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more calculated to preſerve the prerogative of the crown, than to redreſs the grievances of the ſubject. His ſpeech, at the opening of the parliament, was ſuited to the times, and well received. But the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the paſt, created an ill humour among the commons. Seventy thouſand pounds had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as an additional revenue, for the annual and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0709200302:41"/>
neceſſary expences of government. But the houſe were either ſlow in finding the ways and means, or ignorant where they could be found. Two bills, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy drawn, the one for an additional exciſe on malt liquors, the other for a tax on land bearing corn, were ſent down from the Iriſh privy council. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were highly offended at the manner of introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe bills, which were in themſelves, eſpecially the latter, highly exceptionable; and in ſome degree, partial and unjuſt. They argued, that though, by Poyning's law, no bill was to be paſſed, without the ſanction of the Engliſh privy council, it was never deemed that the Iriſh commons were precluded from taxing themſelves<note n="P" place="bottom">Journals, paſſion. Slone's Narrative.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">laid before the Engliſh parliament.</note> The neceſſities of government induced the lord-lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to hearken to a compromiſe. The commons conſented to paſs the exciſe bill, with a declaration, that the thing ſhould not be drawn into a precedent. But they rejected the land-bill, as laying an unequal tax upon the farmers. When Sidney found himſelf in poſſeſſion of the additional exciſe, he gave vent to his reſentment againſt the parliament. He ſent for them, on the fourth of November<note n="Q" place="bottom">1692.</note>. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primanded them ſeverely, for invading the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Crown. He prorogued them to the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of April. Inflamed with what they deemed a public inſult, offended at ſome private expreſſions of indignation from the lord-lieutenant, ſeveral members of the Iriſh houſe of commons came, in the name of their country, to England, to lay their grievances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the parliament. On the twenty-fourth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, they laid their complaints, in writing, before the Engliſh commons. The lords, at the ſame time, took cognizance of the affair, and examined witneſſes. Some circumſtances appeared, upon the inquiry, which ſerved to heighten the miſmanagements of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as the real grievances of Ireland. The army, in want of pay from the Crown, raiſed money by military diſtreſs, from the ſubject, to the incredible
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0709200302:42"/>
amount of two hundred thouſand pounds<note n="R" place="bottom">Slone and Brewſter's Narratives.</note>. The ſtores left by James in the kingdom, to the value, it was ſaid, of eighty thouſand pounds, were embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled or applied to his own uſe by Coningſby. The lord-lieutenant himſelf, and Ginckle, who had been created Earl of Athlone, were accuſed of poſſeſſing themſelves of almoſt all the forfeitures which ought to have fallen to the public<note n="S" place="bottom">Ibid. paſſim.</note>. But one of the moſt flagrant inroads upon the conſtitution, was the depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the citizens of Dublin of their right to chuſe their own magiſtrates.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance on that ſubject.</note> The lords preſented an addreſs, upon the ſubject of the Iriſh complaints. The commons ſent a remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance to the throne. To the grievances already ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, the latter added ſeveral others of the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming kind. They complained of the miſeries of free quarters, and the licentiouſneſs of the army, to which the Proteſtant ſubjects had been expoſed. They repreſented the danger of recruiting the troops, as had been notoriouſly done, with Iriſh Papiſts; and ſuch perſons as had been in open rebellion. They averred, that the common courſe of law was ſtopt, by granting protections to Roman Catholics, not comprehended within the articles of pacification; and that it was from the mercenary views of the ſervants of the Crown, that the impolitic addition was made to the treaty with the Papiſts, at the ſurrender of Limerick. All theſe grievances they requeſted the King to redreſs; and he promiſed to rectify all that had been amiſs in Ireland. The miſeries of that kingdom might, perhaps, have been exaggerated. The expectations of the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were high, from the ſucceſs of their party. The claims of the Papiſts were extenſive, from the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able articles by which they had finiſhed the war. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent injuries were added, on both ſides, to ancient prejudices and animoſities. To ſatisfy either, was certainly a thing difficult for any government. But it is equally certain, that the ſervants of the Crown were much leſs attentive to the happineſs of the people,

He thanked the commons for their large ſupplies. He ſignified to the two houſes, his intention of going abroad.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this ſoothing ſpeech, the different parties, in both houſes, were highly offended at the ſudden pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation. The Whigs reſented the meaſure, as an aggravating ſequel to the King's refuſing his aſſent to the bill for ſhortening the duration of parliaments. The diſcontented part of the Tories joined, upon other grounds, the general cry. The Jacobites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt violent in their principles, were leaſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in their language. All parties carried their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents and arguments to the preſs. The Earl of Warrington, Hampden, and Wildman were ſuppoſed to inflame the Whigs, with publications. The church, offended at the coldneſs of William, ſupported the opinions of the high Tories to the world.

               <p>

The hopes of James aroſe, in proportion to the odium which a tranſaction ſo barbarous had thrown upon the government of his rival. But, prior to that event, the late King had laid a plan for invading Scotland. In the end of the year 1691, he ſolicited Lewis the Fourteenth, for a force to ſail from Breſt, Belleiſle,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0709200302:44"/>
or Rochfort; and to land between Irving and Air. When the King of France had reſolved to tranſport an army into England, under the conduct of James, before the affair of La Hogue, the Scottiſh expedition was not relinquiſhed. Two frigates, with officers, ſtores, arms, and a ſmall ſum of money, were to ſail from Ambleteuſe, when the main fleet were to put to ſea. The defeat of Tourville broke this, as well as all the other meaſures of the late King. His attention afterwards was chiefly turned to England. The Earls of Arran and Breadalbin, and Sir James Montgomery, were the only perſons of rank in Scotland, who held any correſpondence with the court of St. Germains; though the greateſt part, by far, of the gentry of the kingdom were in the intereſt of the late King<note n="W" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, paſſim.</note>.</p>

The nation in general ſhewed a manifeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience under the government of William. But thoſe who oppoſed that Prince the moſt, covered, under ſpecious complaints of grievances, their attachment to his rival. The King, by the advice of ſecretary John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, managed his affairs with prudence. He gained, by promoting their leaders, the Preſbyterians. He reconciled the Duke of Hamilton and his party to his government, by appointing that nobleman commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner to the approaching parliament. On the eighteenth of April, in the preſent year, a parliament met at Edinburgh. To flatter the pride of the Scots, the King ſignified in his letter, that ever ſince his coming to the Crown, he had been fully reſolved to hold a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in perſon, in his ancient kingdom. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that nothing but his neceſſary preſence abroad, or the buſineſs of his ſtation, when in England, could have hitherto prevented his purpoſe.

They fined ſuch lords as declined to attend in parliament. A committee of ſecrecy had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to inquire into the deſigns of the adherents of the late King. Upon ſome allegorical letters, that had been intercepted, they formed their report. They declared, that there had been, and ſtill was, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſubſiſting between the Jacobites and France, for invading the kingdom with a foreign force. Several lords were impriſoned in the caſtles of Sterling and Edinburgh, rather on ſuſpicion than on proof. One Payne, an Engliſhman, who was actually an agent for James in Scotland, was in cuſtody, and threatened with a trial. But this zeal for his government, was not properly returned by the King. He declined to levy the new troops. But he took care to raiſe the tax appointed for their ſubſiſtence, and to apply it to other uſes of his own<note n="X" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. iii.</note>.</p>

King James, eager to recover his crown, offered terms, which even the moſt ſcrupulous among the diſcontented approved. In a letter, in the end of November, he explained his views, with great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and addreſs. He lamented, that it had been hitherto his misfortune to be miſtaken in his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his people. He, however, appealed to God, for the uniform ſincerity of his heart. He ſolemnly aſſured the nation, that, according to the moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſignification of the words, he was ready to agree to any laws that ſhould be deſired, for the ſecurity of the Proteſtant religion, as eſtabliſhed in the church of England. He promiſed to ſettle, with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of parliament, a liberty of conſcience. He was fully reſolved, he ſaid, to aſſent to all laws, for ſecuring effectually the liberty and property of the ſubject, not only during his own reign, but againſt all the incroachments of his poſterity and ſucceſſors in the throne. He affirmed, that it was his reſolution to meet his people frequently in parliament, as the beſt expedient to render a King truly great and the ſubject perfectly happy; and that it was his determined reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, neither to deſign nor attempt to introduce any arbitrary power in the crown<note n="Z" place="bottom">Ibid.

He was ſenſible that the nation, beſides the violence done to their own principles, had not found their account in the injury they had done to his right. He was no ſtranger, he ſaid, from that circumſtance, that ſome, who were diſpleaſed with the times, purſued projects of redreſs by other means than his reſtoration. But he averred, that his return to his native country was the only thing that could either give a better eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the future, or relieve them from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtreſs.

To create future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, he deſired to forget the paſt. He was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for his own part, to pardon all the miſcarriages of all his ſubjects, without exception.

The Earl of Middleton, in the month of January, returned to France, with eight propoſals from thoſe who wiſhed to reſtore the late King, upon conditions. They were accepted without heſitation. The high opinion which James always entertained of the importance of the fleet, induced him to apply to the principal officers, with unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diligence. Ruſſel had promiſed, in the preceding autumn, his beſt endeavours to ſerve his cauſe. But William, in conſequence of Ruſſel's oppoſition in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and his diſputes with the Earl of Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, had deprived that officer of the chief command Delaval, Killegrew, and Shovel, were appointed, in a joint commiſſion, to execute the office of admiral. The two firſt had been, for ſome time, in the intereſt of the late King.

It was dated at St. Germains, on the ſeventeenth of April<note n="D" place="bottom">April 17, N. S.</note>. He promiſed an unlimited pardon to all his ſubjects, an abſolute oblivion of all the paſt. He declared, that he would immediately call a parliament, inform himſelf, through them, of the inclinations of his people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, by their concurrence, former grievances, and give every ſecurity for their future happineſs. He promiſed to protect the church of England; to ſecure to its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers all the churches, univerſities, colleges, and ſchools; to confirm their immunities, rights, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. He pledged his word to recommend to his parliament an impartial liberty of conſcience. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he would never violate the teſt, and that he would leave the diſpenſing power of the crown, in other matters, to be explained and limited by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the nation.

He declared his willingneſs to re-eſtabliſh, in the moſt ample manner, the act of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of Ireland, as paſſed in his brother's reign; to relinquiſh the chimney-money, or any other part of the revenue, as ſhould be deemed burdenſome to the people, for any other more eaſy aſſeſſment. He aſſured his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he had formed his declaration upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a great number of his ſubjects of all ranks and degrees; who had already adjuſted the manner of his re-aſcending the throne. To remove the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

of his ſubjects, that great ſums might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by France, he poſitively aſſured them, that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty expected no compenſation, but the glory of having ſuccoured an injured Prince. He added, that he was on the eve of coming to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his own right, and to eſtabliſh the liberties of his people; and he concluded with ſolemnly praying, that God might ſo give him ſucceſs, in the proſecution of the one, as he was ſincere in his intentions to confirm the other<note n="E" place="bottom">Printed Declaration.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Legal ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</note> A month after this declaration was dated in France, it was diſperſed privately in England, by the adherents of the late King. Some perſons who had undertaken that dangerous office, were ſecured; and upon ſlender proofs, puniſhed ſeverely for a high miſdemeanour<note n="F" place="bottom">May 15.</note>. Several violent libels againſt the government, had raiſed the reſentment and indignation of the courts of juſtice. The legal ſeverities, of which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple formerly complained, ſeemed, in ſome caſes, to be renewed in all their horror. One Anderton was ſeized<note n="G" place="bottom">May 2.</note>, by the meſſenger of the preſs, as the printer of two ſeditious pamphlets, and committed, for a miſdemeanour, to Newgate. But when he offered ſufficient bail, he was, by a freſh warrant, continued in priſon for high treaſon. On the trial of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate perſon, no poſitive evidence of guilt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Though the ſtatute of treaſon allowed no conjectural preſumptions, no ſtrained inferences, no forced conſtructions, he was at length condemned. Treby, lord-chief-juſtice of the common pleas, and formerly a vehement patriot, preſided at his trial; and was ſaid to have even ſurpaſſed Jefferys himſelf, in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, upon this occaſion. He brow-beat the priſoner. He rejected, without any anſwer, his defence. He revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and threatened the jury, when they ſeemed to lean to the favourable ſide. The novelty of Anderton's caſe, being the firſt who had ever ſuffered death for print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, raiſed the attention of the public. The lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the proof was generally condemned; and to convict upon preſumptions, in caſes of treaſon, was

deemed a dangerous innovation<note n="H" place="bottom">Anderton's Caſe.</note>. But when a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is divided into two inveterate parties, it is difficult to exclude violence, even from the ſeats of juſtice.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Campaign in Flanders.</note> The King, impatient to open the campaign in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, left Kenſington, on the thirty-firſt of March, and arrived in the Maeſe, on the ſecond of April. The French had diſturbed the winter itſelf, with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary excurſions and attacks. They had taken Furnes and Dixmuyde, in the end of November, with their garriſons, conſiſting chiefly of the Engliſh who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thoſe places, in the cloſe of the preceding cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. His own preparations, the neceſſity of ſettling, previouſly, the councils of the Allies, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of aſſembling the forces, detained the King at Loo and the Hague, till the middle of May. Having join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the troops of the Allies at Deigham, he marched from thence to Parks, near Louvaine; and, by that judicious poſition, is ſaid to have broken the deſigns of France upon Brabant. Lewis the Fourteenth with an equipage more ſuitable to a triumph than a cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, joined his army, conſiſting of one hundred thouſand men, on the ſecond of June. Maeſtricht, Charleroy, Huy, Bruſſels and Liege, dreaded by turns the fall of the ſtorm. But the French King having fallen ſick, ſoon after his arrival, returned to Verſailles, and left to the Mareſchal de Luxembourg the conduct of military operations in Flanders. Luxembourg, on the fifteenth of June, placed his head quarters at Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dert, within half a league of the camp of the Allies. The two armies continued in this ſituation above a month. Each endeavoured to find an opportunity of giving battle to advantage; while both ſuffered great hardſhips from the inceſſant rains.</p>

He ſat down before Huy; which ſurrendered in two days. Having amuſed the enemy with a feigned deſign upon Liege, he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quitted his poſt at Hellicheim, croſſed the Jaar in four columns, directed his march toward the Allies;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0709200302:51"/>
being determined to attack them in their camp, or if they retreated to fall upon their rear. His van was in ſight, before they were appriſed of his march. The King made the neceſſary preparations for receiving the enemy with vigour. He ſent away his heavy baggage. He ordered his infantry to intrench themſelves in the front of his camp. The river Geette bounded his right, and ran, winding, along his rear. On the left, and in the front of the left, was the brook of Landen. A thick hedge joining with one end, the Geete covered part of the front of his right wing. The village of Neerwinden, with entrenchments before it, was ſituated between the left end of the hedge and the center. The village of Romſdorff ſtood farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, oppoſed to the front of the left wing; and the entrenchment before it ſtretched to the rivulet of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. A line of entrenchments extended themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the two villages; and behind theſe, the army of the Allies was formed. Their whole front was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one hundred pieces of cannon; which by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantageouſly placed, on an eminence, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the approaches to their line<note n="I" place="bottom">Mem. de Feuquieres.</note>.</p>

Between this village and that of Romfdorff, he placed forty battalions, in the night. He formed his center of eight lines of horſe and foot intermixed. His horſe, on the left wing, were ordered to extend themſelves to the Geette, oppoſing their line to the thick hedge which covered the front of the enemy's right. The French were formed before five in the morning, and the cannonading began on both ſides. Six brigades, under the Duke of Berwick and two other lieutenant generals, attacked the village of Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winden. This important poſt was carried. But it was ſoon recovered by the vigilance of William; who had the good fortune, at the ſame inſtant, to ſee his enemies repulſed on every ſide. The center of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0709200302:52"/>
French army was not properly ſuſtained by either wing. But the Mareſchal de Luxembourg was not to be intimidated. He made a ſecond effort on Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winden. He ſucceeded. He was again repulſed. He reſolved to attack ſome other quarter of the enemy. They were inacceſſible every where. The village of Neerwinden is a third time attacked. William, with great bravery, led twice the Engliſh infantry to the entrenchment, which the enemy endeavoured to force. Nothing, however could reſiſt the impetuoſity of the French. Their center, reinforced by their right, opened a way for their cavalry into the very lines of the Allies. They flanked the Engliſh. They charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put to flight the troops of Hanover. They overturned and routed the Spaniards<note n="L" place="bottom">William's account. Gazettes.</note>.</p>

But the enemy gave him no time to form. They flanked the Dutch horſe, as they came. They broke them, in a furious onſet, before the Engliſh could draw into a line. The King, however, was not to be driven from the field. He ordered his troops to charge as they found themſelves. His efforts were attended with ſome ſucceſs, when he perceived his right wing driven headlong into the Geete. Nothing but confuſion could now be ſeen throughout the camp. Slaughter and flight prevailed every where, on the field. The bridge being too much crowded by the runaways, many were drowned in the river. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam retreated, in the ſame order, with the remains of the left wing. He, however, left a complete vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the enemy. Sixty-ſix pieces of cannon, eight mortars, eighty ſtandards, colours, and other trophies fell into the hands of the French. Twelve thouſand of the Allies lay dead in this bloody field. Two thouſand were made priſoners. The Mareſchal de Luxembourg gained little but glory from the battle of Landen. He loſt eight thouſand of his beſt troops, in the action; and his army was ſo much weakened, 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0709200302:53"/>
by the number wounded, that he could take no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the conſternation of the enemy<note n="M" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, tom. iii.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reflections on his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</note> William diſplayed, upon this occaſion, great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and preſence of mind. He expoſed his perſon to danger. He iſſued his orders with coolneſs. He was preſent every where. He has, notwithſtanding, been cenſured, for hazarding, in his circumſtances, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral engagement. He had detached a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his troops, under the Duke of Wertemberg. He had ſent a reinforcement to the garriſon of Liege<note n="N" place="bottom">Mem. de Feuquieres.</note>. In point of numbers, he was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to Luxembourg. He had ſufficient time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat beyond the Geette, and cover himſelf from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult behind that river<note n="O" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. His poſt, however, was ſo ſtrong, that his officers encouraged him to fight; and he himſelf was extremely anxious to recover the laurels which he had loſt in the preceding campaign. Six weeks of inactivity ſucceeded the battle. Both ſides, weakened by their loſſes, ſeemed unwilling to grapple again in the field. The Mareſchal de Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg, being at length reinforced, by detachments from the coaſts of Picardy and Normandy, as well as from the army on the upper Rhine, moved toward Charleroy. He ſat down before that place, on the eleventh of September. William made no efforts to raiſe the ſiege. The garriſon behaved themſelves with ſuch ſpirit as deſerved relief. The King quitted the army, on the fifth of October; and Charleroy ſurrendered on the eleventh of that month<note n="P" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, vol. iii.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Campaign on the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Rhine.</note> On the ſide of Germany, the French tarniſhed their ſucceſs with acts of barbarity and cruelty. The Mareſchal de Lorges, having paſſed the Rhine at Philipſburgh without oppoſition<note n="Q" place="bottom">May 18.</note>, detached de Chamilli, with twenty thouſand men, to inveſt Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberg. In the midſt of diſſentions, which prevailed among the garriſon, that place was ſtormed. The ſoldiers and burghers were promiſcuouſly put to the ſword. When ſlaughter ended, rapine began. The houſes were burnt, the churches pillaged, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0709200302:54"/>
ſtripped naked, the women expoſed to violence and luſt. De Lorges, in the mean time, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from paſſing the Necker, by the Prince of Baden, who commanded the confederate army. The King of France having undertaken to the Ottomans, to make a powerful diverſion on the ſide of Germany, had detached<note n="R" place="bottom">June 10.</note> twenty thouſand men from the army in Flanders, to the Upper Rhine. When this rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement joined de Lorges, the Dauphin aſſumed the command of the army.

The Germans, under the Prince of Baden, unable to contend with ſuch ſuperior numbers, avoided the riſque of a battle, in a ſtrong poſt. The Dauphin returned to Verſailles. The French and Imperialiſts, having remained, for ſome time, in the field, in a ſtate of inactivity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, at length, to their reſpective winter quarters.</p>

The duke of Savoy, at the head of the confederates, ſat down before Pignerol. The Mareſchal de Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, having been reinforced with ten thouſand men, from the army on the Upper Rhine, deſcended from the mountains; and, from his motions, ſeemed to threaten Turin. The Duke, having bombarded Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol, raiſed the ſiege, on the ſecond of October. He advanced to the ſmall river Ciſola, where it paſſes by Marſaglia. He ſent away his heavy baggage, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to engage de Catinat. The next day, the two armies came in ſight and formed themſelves in order of battle. Neither ſide ſhewing any inclination to come to battle, the conſederates lay, all night, on the field, in their arms. When day light appeared, the French were already formed. The allies were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in motion. The Imperial and Piedmonteſe cavalry, commanded by the Duke in perſon, covered the right wing.

of Savoy and Great Britain, were in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, under the famous Prince Eugene. The Spaniards, led by their native officers, formed the left wing. The French began the attack, in an unuſual manner. They received the fire of the Spaniards, as they advanced, and then charged them, with bayonets fixed and ſword in hand. The whole wing was broken in an inſtant and thrown, in their confuſion, on the center. The battle was ſuſtained, by the latter, with great obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy. They were, however, broken, at length, and forced to fly. A complete victory remained to the French. The cannon, colours, ſtandards, and light baggage of the allies, fell into the hands of the enemy. They loſt eight thouſand men in the field. The Duke of Schomberg, who commanded the troops in the pay of Great Britain, was wounded and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.

In Catalonia, the Mareſchal de Noail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les took Roſes, in the ſight of the enemy. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, enfeebled by the deſpicable councils of Charles the Second, were unable to repel the victors. The French were too few and ill provided to purſue the advantages which they had obtained.

The war, in Hungary, produced no ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal event. The Imperialiſts, under the Duke de Croy, laid ſiege to Belgrade in vain. After five weeks open trenches, they ſtormed the counterſcarp. But they were repulſed with great ſlaughter. The grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier advanced, in the mean time, with an army. The Duke de Croy, having called a council of war, reſolved to raiſe the ſiege. He ſent away his heavy baggage. He repaſſed, with his army, the Saave.

The war in Flanders having ingroſſed the whole attention of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, the navy was much neglected by his ſervants. Notwithſtanding the great ſupplies that had been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the fleet was not ready to ſail till the middle of May; and then it was feebly manned, and ill ſupplied with neceſſaries and proviſions. Killegrew, Delaval, and Shovel, who executed the office of admiral, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been reinforced by the Dutch, arrived at St. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, on the ſeventh of May. The whole fleet was to have conſiſted of one hundred ſail of men of war, ſeventy of which were to have been of the line. They, however, had not all rendezvouſed when the admirals arrived.

The ſquadron equipped at Toulon, and commanded by D'Eſtrees, received orders to advance to the Streights.

James requeſted him to betray the councils of the King, and to obſtruct and defeat his meaſures in parliament. He deſired him, if he could depend upon his ſon, to induce him to keep his command in the navy. He inſtructed the Earl of Shrewſbury, the Earl of Marlborough, and the Lord Godolphin to exert themſelves ſecretly againſt William, to hinder, or at leaſt to retard, the giving of money, to prevent the early ſailing of the ſleet, in the following year<note n="G" place="bottom">Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art-papers, Oct. 1693.</note>.</p>

The adherents of the late King inſinuated, that to reſtore Ruſſel to the command of the fleet, was to ſoothe the nation for the miſcarriages at ſea. He was accordingly replaced in his former office, on the ſixth of November. The anxiety with which James purſued this point, is as unaccountable as it is remarkable.

He had promiſed to gain to his intereſt the county of York, of which he was lord-lieutenant; to ſurrender to him the citadel of Hull, of which he was gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.

In the liſt of noble correſpondents with the court of St. Germains, the two parties were blended with one

The county of Somerſet, the ſeat of Monmouth's rebellion and Jefferys's cruelties, was now ready to receive him with open arms. The town of Taunton itſelf, that had ſuffered ſo much eight years before, for oppoſing James, expreſſed the greateſt affection for his perſon and the warmeſt zeal for his reſtoration. The legal ſeverities of the year 1685 muſt, therefore, have been exaggerated; or the people acquitted the King of the rigorous conduct of his ſervants. The Lord Powlet, and the majority of the gentlemen of the county, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the citizens of Taunton, ſolemnly engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to James, to riſe in his cauſe. Even individuals were as unſteady to their former principles, as bodies of men. The famous Ferguſon, who had uniformly abetted the oppoſition to the late King, till he loſt his throne, employed, at this time, all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of his active ſpirit in his cauſe. He requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he even implored him to invade the kingdom. To teſtify his own zeal, to encourage James with a certainty of his ſucceſs, he propoſed to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in France to be puniſhed with death, ſhould the enterpriſe fail. Some of the clergy who had moſt oppoſed James, ran ſo violently into the other extreme, that they were determined to form themſelves into a company of volunteers, to ſerve in the regiment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir John Friend<note n="M" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1693.</note>.</p>

William having diſtinguiſhed Sunderland with his favour, for former ſervices, furniſhed that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0709200302:63"/>
lord, a ſecond time, with an opportunity to betray. Having, with his uſual addreſs, convinced the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of King James of the ſincerity of his repentance, he wrote a letter full of contrition for his paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, to that Prince. He told him, that a deſcent, with a competent force, was the only means of finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the misfortunes of the King, and the miſeries of the nation. He informed him, that from the ſtate of the kingdom, an invaſion could not fail of ſucceſs. He declined to enter into particulars, becauſe he was afraid his Majeſty did not confide ſufficiently in his advice. But when he ſhould be aſſured that the King was ſatisfied with his fidelity, he promiſed to ſend the beſt intelligence; and to contribute all in his power to his ſervice. The Earl of Arran vouched for the ſincerity of Sunderland. The Earl of Marlborough pleaded in his favour. But James had felt ſo much from his treachery before, that even his purſuing the natural bias of his mind, with regard to William, could not convince him, for ſome time, that Sunderland was ſincere<note n="N" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1694.</note>.</p>

William opened the ſeſſion, on the ſeventh of November, with a ſpeech from the throne. He lamented, that his uſual joy at meeting his parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was damped by diſadvantages by land, and miſcarriages at ſea. He aſcribed the former to the number of their enemies. He expreſſed his reſentment againſt the authors of the latter. He declared his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to puniſh the offenders. He promiſed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage better, for the future, his power at ſea. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to conſider, whether the kingdom was not defective in the number of ſhips; and in proper ports to annoy the enemy, and to protect themſelves. He was very ſenſible, he ſaid, of the great affection with which they had ſupported him againſt his enemies. But he was perſuaded, that the experience of the laſt ſummer was ſufficient to convince them all, that an increaſe of forces, by ſea and land, was neceſſary to put a happy period to the war. His allies, he ſaid,

had reſolved to add to their troops. He formed no doubt, on his part, but his parliament would enable him, with a ſuitable ſupply, to follow their example. He earneſtly requeſted the commons to haſten their grants, in order to render them effectual.

                  <note place="margin">Proceedings of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> Many in the lower houſe were attached to the late King. But the majority, though tories in principle, had uniformly ſupported the cauſe of William. The people, diſcouraged with repeated misfortunes, and feeling the weight of the war on every branch of their commerce, were loud in demanding peace. Some of the Tory-leaders in office, particularly the Earl of Nottingham, joined the voice of the people. Others of the ſame party ſacrificed their opinion to their intereſt; and adhered to the court. A diſpute aroſe in the houſe, whether the miſcarriages of the fleet, or the ſupply, ſhould be the firſt object of their conſideration. The queſtion was carried for the latter, after a ſeries of debates, which continued ſix days. On the thirteenth of November, the houſe unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly reſolved to ſupport their Majeſties, and their government, to their utmoſt power. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vaſt ſums raiſed in the preceding year, they had greatly fallen ſhort of the expences of government. Thoſe who ſerved in the army, were in the utmoſt diſtreſs for money. More than one million of the wages of the ſeamen, without any funds, remained unpaid. Though the greateſt ſeverities were uſed, the ſailors, in their diſtreſs, became mutinous for want of pay. The firſt buſineſs, therefore, of the commons, was to grant four hundred thouſand pounds, by way of advance, to remove immediately a part of that grievance. This ſum was to be raiſed on the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral credit of the exchequer, upon the promiſe of the commons to repay it with intereſt, after the rate of ſeven per cent, under a caution, that this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould form no precedent<note n="P" place="bottom">Journals.

Upon the general eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the navy and army, they granted five milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the ſervice of the following year. Forty thouſand ſeamen, including two regiments of marines, were required by government, and voted by the houſe. But to a demand of one hundred thouſand men, for the land-ſervice, they granted only eighty-three thouſand. In this only they ſeemed uncomplaiſant to the court. Beſides a proviſion made for paying all wages due to ſeamen, more than four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds were voted, for making up the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the grants of the preceding year. It was much more eaſy to grant the ſupplies in general, than to find particular funds, upon which they might be laid. The commons began with a land-tax. Four ſhillings in the pound were carried, as ſoon as propoſed<note n="Q" place="bottom">Dec. 21. Dec. 29.</note>. The deficiencies of the laſt year were to be defrayed from this ready fund. The ſecond money bill was a ſupplement to the million annuity act of the year 1692. Near one hundred and twenty thouſand pounds were ſtill deficient; though fourteen per cent, had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Some appropriations of exciſe duties were made for this purpoſe. The firſt lottery, and the bank of England, were two remarkable money-bills, in the preſent ſeſſion of parliament. One million was raiſed by means of the firſt; and one million five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds by the ſecond. Still the ways and means fell ſhort of the money wanted.

The facility with which it ſlipt through both houſes, proceeded probably from the certainty that it was to be rejected by the King. The commons had become unpopular, through the vaſt ſums which they had granted for ſupporting an inglorious war.

The train of corruption, which ſoon after broke forth in ſuch diſgraceful diſcoveries, had been already laid.

The accuſation againſt Porter, was ſcarce leſs ſevere. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamont ſupported, with vouchers, every charge. The commons ſeemed convinced of the guilt. But they declined to ground upon them an impeachment. The reaſon which they aſſigned, was plauſible if not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. They inſinuated, that in times of domeſtic commotions and civil war, exertions of power might be neceſſary, which ſhould not be puniſhed, though they ought not to be approved. Though this argument ſatisfied the commons, it was notorious, that the crimes charged upon the accuſed, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after the eſtabliſhment of a civil government and the opening of the courts of Juſtice. Bellamont, for endeavouring to puniſh others, was actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted himſelf. He was deprived of his place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government, while Coningſby and Porter received a pardon under the great ſeal<note n="W" place="bottom">Journals, paſſim.</note>.

They obſerved, in their letters to the late King, that a deſcent in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land would infallibly break the league; and enable France to finiſh with advantage, as well as reputation, the war.

Marlborough continued to eſpouſe, with eagerneſs, his former maſter's cauſe. He intreated him to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the unprepared ſtate of the Engliſh fleet.

When they perceived a coldneſs in the court of France, they leſſened their demands. In the month of February they aſſured James, that they found his party much ſtronger than they had ever imagined before. They ſaid twenty thouſand men would now be ſufficient to give him, without a battle, the throne. They affirmed, that the nation expected, with impatience, his arrival. They told him, that England could not, till the month of April, ſend to ſea above twenty-five third and fourth rate men of war, and theſe not completely manned. That no more than ſeven thouſand five hundred troops were then in the kingdom; and that even theſe would be diminiſhed to four thouſand, when the regiments deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined for Flanders, ſhould embark for that country<note n="B" place="bottom">Ibid.

But he meant nothing leſs, than to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, with any vigour, his cauſe. Though victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the field, he was oppreſſed with calamities at home. Having exerted his whole force in the late campaigns, he had already impoveriſhed his ſubjects with grievous taxes.

Marlborough was the firſt of the malcontents who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf to Lloyd. He informed him, that he had been ſolicited by William to come again into office. But that he did not chuſe to accept, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his old maſter. Lloyd aſſured him, that James had actually heard of the offer; and that he had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſignify his conſent. "The thing," replied Marlborough, <q rend="inline">"is now paſt. Should the offer, which may well happen, again be made, I will accept.

He aſſured him, with the ſtrongeſt aſſeverations and even with oaths, that he would undertake the reſtoration of the late King. He promiſed to endeavour to gain the officers of the fleet. He reiterated his moſt ſolemn proteſtations of fidelity. He told him, that the Earls of Shrewſbury and Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough ſhould be the wineſſes, the judges and ſureties of his conduct. He, however, refuſed to avoid the French fleet; "though," ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"I once deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to execute that buſineſs, as it depended then on myſelf alone<note n="F" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>."</q>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ruſſel,</note> Lloyd, not yet ſatisfied with the anſwer of Ruſſel, opened various expedients to his view. He told him that there certainly was a deſign in agitation for making a deſcent on the coaſt of France. He, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted Ruſſel to ſend timely information to James, that tranſports might be prepared, where no attack could be feared. He propoſed, that toward the end of autumn, when the large ſhips ſhould be diſarmed and convoys ſent to America, he might retain in the channel ſuch commanders as he ſhould gain in the ſummer. That ſafe in their fidelity, he might him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0709200302:71"/>
tranſport ſuch troops, as might be neceſſary for accompanying the late King to England. He ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, but ſeemed unwilling to determine on any plan. Lloyd gave an account to the Earl of Marlborough and to Sackville of his conference with Ruſſel. They obſerved, that he ſaid a great deal, could he be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But that if he was not ſincere, all he could ſay would anſwer no purpoſe<note n="G" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, paſſim.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Shrewſbury,</note> The Earl of Shrewſbury had ſucceeded Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham as ſecretary of ſtate, on the fourth of March, a few days before Lloyd arrived from France. His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in office prevented him from admitting into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the avowed agent of the late King. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſent his mother, the old Counteſs of Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, to Lloyd, with aſſurances of his fidelity. He inſtructed her to inform him, that upon being ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take the ſeals, he declined that honour, under the pretence of want of health. That William inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated he was no ſtranger to ſome words which the earl dropt in converſation, in favour of the late King. That the earl perceived there might be ſome danger in refuſing the offer. That he, therefore, promiſed to accept. But that he requeſted a few days, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his affairs in the country. That he accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, with ſome friends, well mounted. That, as reports of an immediate deſcent were then current, he had reſolved to join James on his landing. That he was diſappointed in his hopes, to his very great regret. That he was obliged to take the ſeals, on his return. But that he only held them, to ſerve the late King with more effect<note n="H" place="bottom">Ibid. March 1694.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Godolphin,</note> Godolphin was, at this juncture, firſt lord-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of the treaſury. Though he was truſted by William, he affected to be in the intereſt of the late King. He explained to Lloyd his ſentiments of James, in the moſt affectionate manner in the world. He expreſſed his fears, that a peace was likely to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded before the end of the next ſummer. He told him, that he was ſorry to believe, from the words of the Prince of Orange, for ſo he called the reigning
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0709200302:72"/>
King, that the terms would be highly prejudicial to the late King. He informed him, that William would endeavour to oblige the moſt Chriſtian King to ſend James out of the dominions of France. That he thought it his duty to acquaint his old maſter of the deſigns of his enemy and rival. He told it as his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that King James ſhould forthwith endeavour to tranſport himſelf into England, with a conſiderable force. That there appeared to him no difficulty in making a deſcent in this kingdom, without either the aid or concurrence of Ruſſel. That, however, he ought ſtill to be treated with attention. That he had ſaid all that could be expected from a perſon in his ſituation. That the Earl of Shrewſbury, who was ſincerely in the intereſt of the late King, poſſeſſed an abſolute influence over Ruſſel. He aſſured Lloyd, that Ruſſel would infallibly appear before Breſt. That this circumſtance would give a juſt pretence to Lewis to ſend an army to the coaſt. He adviſed, therefore, that the neceſſary tranſports might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the ſummer, to carry to Britain the invaders in autumn. He told him, that the large veſſels would return to port in the middle of September. That the ſailors would be diſperſed, the convoys ſent to the different places of commerce, the coaſt left bare of men of war. That he believed a revolution might be effected without a blow; as nine in ten of the people, either heartily deteſted William, or were firmly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the late King<note n="I" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, March 1694.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sunderland,</note> Though the Earl of Sunderland poſſeſſed no office under William, he held, for an Engliſhman, a high place in his favour. Swayed by the natural levity of his own mind, or infected with the changed opinions of others, he continued his correſpondence with the late King. He, however, was more guarded in his intercourſe with that Prince, than thoſe great men who truſted their lives and fortunes in the hands of intermediate agents. His ſon-in-law the Earl of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, who firſt promoted his intrigues with the court of St. Germains, was the only perſon in the ſecret in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0709200302:73"/>
Britain<note n="K" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, March 1694.</note>. In France, James concealed, with great caution, his intercourſe with a man who had ſo much injured his cauſe before. Sunderland preſſed the late King to an immediate invaſion upon various grounds. He intreated that Prince to take advantage of the changed opinions of the people; their contempt for William, their diſcontent at the late heavy taxes, their loſſes at ſea, their diſappointments in the war by land. Theſe circumſtances, he informed him, would enſure a favourable reception to himſelf in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, while the deſign of ſending the greateſt part of the fleet to the Streights, and almoſt the whole of the army to Flanders, would render his paſſage eaſy and his ſucceſs certain. He adviſed the late King not to be intimidated with the great ſupplies granted to the reigning Prince, as the money given by the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could not be raiſed in time to place the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in a ſtate of defence<note n="L" place="bottom">Stuart-papers.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Whigs and Tories pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly in office.</note> While Sunderland tendered thus his advice to James, HE and the Earl of Portland formed the ſecret cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of William<note n="M" place="bottom">Dutch encroachments, p. 20.</note>. That Prince felt ſome part of the misfortunes, which he had contributed to throw on his predeceſſor, when he ſat on the throne. He was worſt ſerved by thoſe whom he courted the moſt. Impreſſed with the opinion, that intereſt forms the principles of men, he reſolved to bribe into fidelity thoſe whom he could not otherwiſe truſt. In the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements of the preſent year, he ſeems however to have regarded moſt the ſuppoſed Whigs. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, in particular, was placed in the hands of that party. Ruſſel was made firſt commiſſioner; Rook and Houblon ſupplanted the obnoxious admirals Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val and Killigrew, at the board. Though William ſeems to have entertained ſome well-grounded ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Shrewſbury, he was accounted a Whig by the nation; and though the Marquis of Caermarthen was conſidered a Tory, by principle, his known prudence was deemed a ſecurity for his faith to the prevailing powers. But ſome other perſons of rank, who were
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0709200302:74"/>
known to be adverſe to the late revolution, were either continued in employment or raiſed to office. Among the latter, the Earl of Abingdon, then actually in correſpondence with James, ſucceeded to a place of profit, vacant by the death of the Lord Lovelace<note n="N" place="bottom">Gazette.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Titles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</note> On the twenty-fifth of April, a few days after he prorogued his parliament, William went to Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end to embark at that place for Holland. The wind proving contrary, he returned to Kenſington the next day. This accident furniſhed the King with a further opportunity of gratifying ſome of his principal ſubjects with dignities and honours. But though he had of late ſhown ſome attention to the Whigs, his firſt care ſeems ſtill to have been commanded by the Tories. The Marquis of Caermarthen was created, on the thirtieth of April, Duke of Leeds. The title of Duke of Shrewſbury was conferred upon the Earl of the ſame name. The Earl of Clare, then deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with James<note n="O" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1693, 1694.</note>, was raiſed to the dignity of Duke of Newcaſtle. The Earl of Mulgrave, a ſecret abettor of the deſigns of the late King<note n="P" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, was made Marquis of Normanby, with an annual penſion of three thouſand pounds. But no titles of honour, nor even views of profit, could reconcile theſe men either to the manner or title of the King. Shrewſbury and Leeds, whoſe advice Mary was implicitly to follow, in her huſband's abſence, were to have embarraſſed and betrayed her councils, ſhould her father appear with a force in England<note n="Q" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. To ſtop their cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, rather than to gratify the party who had raiſed him to the throne, the King, before his departure for Holland, had ordered patents for dukedoms to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, for the Earls of Bedford and Devonſhire. The firſt derived his title to a name in party, from the fate of his unfortunate ſon. Diſappointments in his views for the public, as well as perſonal neglect, had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the latter indifferent concerning the fate of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, and the permanency of his authority<note n="R" place="bottom">Ibid. 1690, 1691.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at Sea.</note> On the fourth of May, the King embarked at Graveſend. But the wind being contrary, he went by land to Margate; and was eſcorted from that place to Holland by a ſquadron of Dutch men of war. The projected operations of the ſummer at ſea, had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed a great part of his attention during the winter. His councils, however, were betrayed. The deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the different ſquadrons were generally known<note n="S" place="bottom">Stuart papers, 1694.</note>. Nothing but the time of their departure, which depended upon accidents, remained a ſecret. Sir Francis Wheeler, with a ſtrong ſquadron of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and Dutch men of war, had been ſent to convoy the trade to the Mediterranean, in the end of the preceding year. On the ſeventeenth of February, a terrible tempeſt overtook his fleet; in the bay of Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltar. The admiral himſelf, ſome ſhips of war, and ſeveral merchantmen were loſt. The reſt were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled. Some took ſhelter in Gibraltar, many in the harbour of Cadiz. The combined fleets were not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled on the coaſt of England, till the end of April. Ruſſel hoiſted his flag, at Portſmouth, on the twenty-ſeventh of that month; and his avowed deſign was to ſail into the Mediterranean, to defend the ports of Spain from the French; who were reſolved to make the principal effort of the campaign on that ſide<note n="T" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. iii.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">An expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Breſt.</note> But the chief enterpriſe of the ſeaſon, was to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected againſt Breſt. The lord Godolphin had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the late King, in the month of March, with this important intelligence<note n="U" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1694.</note>. But from the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty which attended the ſailing of the fleet, he could not fix the time. General Talmaſh, contrary to the expreſs opinion of Ruſſel, promoted firſt, and at length carried this deſign. When the admiral hoiſted his flag, at St. Helens, the land-forces deſtined for the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were on their march, under Talmaſh, to Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth. The French had made no ſecret of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to aſſiſt, with their whole fleet, the deſigns of the Mareſchal de Noailles upon Barcelona. The court of Spain had concerted with William, to ſend
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0709200302:76"/>
the main body of the combined fleet to protect the place. Men in general believed that the force under Talmaſh, was deſtined for the ſame ſervice. The French were either ignorant of the preparations of the Engliſh, or they knew not where the ſtorm was to fall. The alarm concerning Breſt, which had been raiſed by the intelligence ſent by Godolphin to James, had already ſubſided. Beſides, the danger of France, upon that ſide, had been leſſened by the actual ſailing of her fleet from the port of Breſt, on the fifteenth of April<note n="W" place="bottom">April 15th, N.

                  <note place="margin">Betrayed by the Earl of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, May 4th.</note> The zeal of the Earl of Marlborough for the ſervice of the late King, or his averſion to the reigning Prince, induced that nobleman to become, upon this occaſion, an informer againſt his country. He tranſmitted, through the hands of colonel Sackville, intelligence of the danger to which France was expoſed. His letter was dated, on the fourth of May. He informed James, that twelve regiments encamped at Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, with two regiments of marines, all command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Talmaſh, were deſigned for deſtroying Breſt, and the ſhips of war in that harbour. He owned, that ſucceſs in the enterpriſe would prove of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to England. But that no conſideration could now hinder, or ever ſhould prevent him from inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majeſty of all that he believed to be for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He deſired the late King to make the beſt uſe of the intelligence. He told him, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on its being exactly true. But he conjured him, for his own intereſt, to keep the ſecret to himſelf and the Queen. He informed him that Ruſſel was to ſail, the next day, with forty ſhips; and that the reſt of the fleet, with the land-forces, were to follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, in ten days. He had endeavoured, he ſaid, to learn the whole from Ruſſel. But he always denied the fact, though he was no ſtranger to the deſign, for ſix weeks before. "This," continues the Earl, <q rend="inline">"gives me a bad ſign of this man's intentions."</q> Sackville, who tranſmitted the letter, formed, for the ſame reaſon, a like unfavourable opinion of Ruſſel.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0709200302:77"/>
He mentioned, <q rend="inline">"that THE MAN had not acted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely; and that he feared he would never act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe<note n="X" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, May 1694. James II. 1694.</note>."</q>

Ruſſel ſailed, the next day, with a part of the combined fleets. Shovel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at St. Helens, with the reſt, to take Talmaſh and his troops on board. On the twenty-third of May, the admiral, having diſcovered that the French ſquad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron had left Breſt, returned. On the twenty-ninth, he again put to ſea with the forces; and, on the fifth of June, the diviſion of the fleet deſtined to attack Breſt, bore down for Camaret Bay, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lord Berkley. Nine hundred men were landed, in a diſorderly manner, on the eighth of June, under the fire of ſome men of war. The bay was lined with entrenchments, which were full of the French marines. The Engliſh having, for ſome time, ſuſtained the fire of the enemy, ſuffered much and were forced to fly. To add to the misfortune, it was now ebbing tide, and ſeveral boats were left dry on the ſand. Confuſion and ſlaughter prevailed. Six hundred were ſlain, many were drowned. Talmaſh himſelf received a wound, of which he afterwards died at Plymouth. The ſhips, which covered the landing, were ſhattered by the batteries which guarded the ſhore. One Dutch frigate was ſunk, after loſing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt her whole crew. The French had profited ſo much by the intelligence of Marlborough, that the Engliſh choſe to return, without any further attempt, to their own coaſt<note n="Y" place="bottom">Burnet. Marq. of Caermarthen's Journal.</note>.</p>
               <p>This diſgrace at ſea was not repaired by any ſplendid advantage obtained by land. The French, ſtanding on the defenſive, in Flanders, amuſed William, with dextrous movements, throughout the ſummer. With ſcarce half the force of the allies, the Dauphin, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Mareſchal de Luxembourg, covered from inſult the French lines. The King was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a ſtate of inactivity, with the fineſt army he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0709200302:78"/>

Having march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forty leagues, in four days, they formed an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable line, from the Lys to the ocean; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented William from attacking, by land, the maritime places, which his fleet had inſulted by ſea. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, found means to beſiege and take the town and caſtle of Huy. He ended the campaign with this exploit; and left the army, on the thirtieth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. To ſtop the progreſs of the King, on the ſide of Flanders, was deemed equal to a victory by the court of Verſailles. The confederates had never a nearer proſpect of ſucceſs. But their hopes were defeated, by the abilities of the Mareſchal de Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg<note n="Z" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, vol. iii. Kennet. Ralph.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">In Spain.</note> While the war languiſhed in Flanders, the French puſhed their operations, with vigour, on the ſide of Spain. In Catalonia, the Mareſchal de Noailles, having forced the paſſage of the river Ter, defeated the Spaniſh army entrenched on the further ſhore. He took Palamos, by aſſault, on the ſeventh of June. Gironne and Oſtalric fell ſucceſſively into his hands. His deſigns upon Barcelona were defeated, by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of Ruſſel, with the combined fleet, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſeas. Tourville, with his ſquadron, was blocked up in the port of Toulon. The abſence of their ſhips ſtopt the progreſs of the French. But a panic had ſeized the King, and ſhaken the councils of Spain. The Queen-mother, a daughter of Auſtria, and devoted to the views of her family, prevented Charles the ſecond from ſoliciting peace, on advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous terms. Intrigue, jealouſy, and even murder prevailed at court. The Queen-mother gained the young Queen, by ſupporting her ſuppoſed lover, the Baron de Perlis.

The war, in that country, produced no ſtriking event.

He proceeded from thence to La Hogue and Cherbourg. But his progreſs was more a matter of parade than ſervice. William, anxious to make an impreſſion on France, on the ſide of Flanders, had recommended an attempt upon Dunkirk and Calais, in the courſe of the ſummer. A ſquadron, under the command of Sir Cloudſley Shovel, and ſubject to the directions of one Meeſters, a Dutchman, came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt of thoſe places, on the twelfth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.

The parliament, after repeated prorogations, met on the twelfth at Weſtminſter. The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them in his ſpeech, that he was glad to meet them in ſuch a good poſture of the public affairs. He told them, that the enemy had not been in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to meet the fleet, in theſe ſeas. That the great force ſent into the Mediterranean, had broken all their deſigns in Spain; and that an effectual ſtop had been put to the progreſs of the French arms, on the ſide of Flanders. He doubted not, he ſaid, neither their affection for his perſon, nor their zeal for the public ſervice. He, therefore, demanded ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies as might enable him to proſecute the war with that vigour, which was the only means for procuring peace.

The commons, he found, were reſolved to receive this conceſſion from the crown, as the price of a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for the war. Beſides, the Queen had been taken ill of the ſmall-pox, the day before, with incurable ſymptoms of that dangerous diſeaſe.

The genuine features of her mind are difficult to be traced, as her paſſions were neither uncommon in their kind nor ſtrong in their degree. A ſtrict attention to her huſband, and even an abſolute ſubſerviency to his will, ſeem to have been more the rule of her life, than thoſe more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic virtues, which alone could thoroughly juſtify her political conduct. When ſhe held the reins of government, ſhe diſplayed more prudence than ability, and leſs of art than ſolidity of judgment.

Beſides, gratitude had, perhaps, ſupplied the place of a warm affection, in his breaſt. The Queen certainly deſerved every return of friendſhip, at HIS hands. She had acted, in all reſpects toward him, as if virtue conſiſted ſolely in the implicit obedience of a wife to her huſband. Motives of policy might alſo have joined their force to more tender ſentiments, in his mind. The whole popularity of his meaſures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the open and agreeable deportment of Mary.

The Princeſs of Denmark was induced, by the Earl of Sunderland, to ſend a letter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, on the death of her ſiſter, to the King. This Princeſs, even before her diſgrace, in the year 1692, had begun a ſecret correſpondence with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

A remarkable tranſaction, in the preceding ſummer and autumn, was laid before the commons, early in the preſent ſeſſion. One Lunt, a perſon of a very profligate character, who had once been a day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourer at Highgate, gave information, on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of June, concerning a plot for levying war againſt the government. He affirmed, that he had delivered commiſſions from the late King to ſeveral gentlemen in Lancaſhire and Cheſhire. That, at their inſtance and expence, he had bought arms and enliſted men. That he had been twice ſent to France. to receive the commands of James concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended inſurrection; and that one Wilſon, who had aſſiſted him in delivering the commiſſions, was privy to the circumſtances of the plot. The ſuppoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators were ſeized. They were brought to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and then remanded to Mancheſter, to take their trials. Lunt and Wilſon ſwore to the truth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.

But Lunt, being ordered in court, to point at the ſeveral priſoners, miſtook his men.

The King's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſtopt all proceedings. The priſoners were acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the popular clamour became ſo loud in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the accuſed, that the miniſtry found it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to commit their witneſſes to priſon, and to order them to be proſecuted<note n="P" place="bottom">Trial.

The whole appears to have been framed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and precipitate zeal of one Johnſton, a Scotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, brother to the ſecretary of ſtate of that name. This buſy and ſelf-intereſted man, had, in the hopes of a gratification from William, long acted the part of an informer againſt the Jacobites, in England as well as in Scotland.

The proteſtations of his innocence, with which he blended his ſpeech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bill, were conſidered as ſo many acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of guilt, in a man more remarkable for his talents, than either for his integrity or diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The houſe yielding either to his arguments or influence, poſtponed the buſineſs from the ſixth to the thirteenth of April; a point of conſequence, as the ſeſſion was known to draw near to its cloſe. Cooke was brought before the lords, on the thirteenth. He declared himſelf willing to make a full diſcovery, on condition of being indemnified againſt all actions and ſuits except thoſe of the Eaſt-India company, whom he had never injured. The peers reſolved to drop the bill of pains and penalties, ſent up from the commons; and they ordered a committee to withdraw to form ſuch a bill of indemnification as Cooke required. The commons amended the bill with a penal clauſe. The lords agreed to the amendment; and Cooke was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, by the act, to make a full diſcovery to a joint committee of peers and commons, on or before the twenty-third of April<note n="X" place="bottom">Journals paſſim.</note>.</p>

When he came to the houſe, on the twenty-ſecond of April, to paſs ſeveral bills, he recommended diſpatch to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; as he was determined to put an end to the ſeſſion in a few days.

Ten thouſand pounds were traced to the King; five thouſand to the Duke of Leeds, and other ſums to other men in power. The ſcene of corruption appeared to be as extenſive, as it was ſhameful and uncommon. The matter was reported, on the twenty-ſeventh of April, to both houſes. The commons, in particular, flew into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent flame. The innocent were eager to ſhew their own regard to honour.

They ordered Mr. Comptroller Wharton to impeach him accordingly at the bar of the houſe of lords, in the name of the houſe and all the commons of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The report was read, in the mean time, in the houſe of lords. Leeds was ſpeaking to his own defence, when he was apprized of the proceedings of the commons. He ſuddenly went down to the houſe, and deſired to be heard. He was permitted to ſpeak. But his ſpeech was not ſatisfactory. He prepared for his defence in a more effectual way. One Robart, a Swiſs by nation, and one of his own domeſtics, was the only perſon who could carry home any certain proof to the Duke. Robart was prudently ſent back to his native country. The lords addreſſed the King to ſtop the fugitive, by ſhutting the ports of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt his flight. Neither William nor his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were likely to gain by the inquiry. The procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was not iſſued till nine days after the addreſs of the peers. The clamours of Leeds for a trial or an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal, roſe in proportion to Robart's diſtance from London. A prorogation, on the third of May, at length extinguiſhed the inquiry and the Duke's fears.

The bad ſtate of the coin, both by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution and adulteration, became too obvious not to alarm the nation. The money had actually decreaſed more than one half, in its nominal value. The King had been, for ſome time, apprized of this growing evil<note n="A" place="bottom">Burnet, vol, iii.</note>. He intended to iſſue a proclamation, that no money ſhould paſs, for the future, but by weight. He was, however, diverted from this meaſure, by the conſideration, that the debaſement of the coin would facilitate the loans to government. The Earl of Rocheſter laid open, in the houſe of lords, the alarming condition of the currency; and as early as the eighth of January, a committee of the commons were appointed to receive propoſals to prevent clipping, and the exportation of ſilver. The report of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee lay, for ſome time, neglected on the table. The lords, however, paſſed a bill to prevent the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting and clipping the current coin of the kingdom.

But though the bill contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome good clauſes, it was manifeſtly inadequate to the perfect cure of the evil. The value of money was ſunk in the exchange.

To amuſe the enemy, and to conceal his real deſign upon Namur, he made ſome movements, which rendered Villeroi uncertain where the ſtorm was firſt to fall. The King aſſembled his army in three diviſions. The firſt, under the Elector of Bavaria, he ordered to advance between the Schelde and the Lys. He poſted himſelf, with the ſecond, at Becelaër on the Heule. He detached the Duke of Wirtemberg, with the third diviſion, to inveſt the fort of Knoque.

The enemy perceiving, at length, the deſigns of William upon Namur, the Mareſchal de Boufflers, with ſeven regiments of dragoons, threw himſelf into the place, to reinforce the garriſon. Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roi, inſtead of making any attempt to relieve Namur, reſolved to fall upon the Prince of Vaudemont, who lay, with an inferior force, within three leagues of his army.

When he deliberated, concerning the manner of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, the opportunity was loſt. The like advantage preſented itſelf a ſecond time.

                  <note place="margin">Operations.</note> The fine retreat of the Prince of Vaudemont, was conſidered equal to a victory. The French, however, found means to take Dixmuyde and Deynſe, with little reſiſtance. The garriſons were made priſoners of war. Both places were diſmantled. The trenches were, in the mean time, opened before Namur. On the twelfth of July the batteries began to play. In a ſally, on the eighteenth, the French were forced to retreat, with conſiderable loſs. The King, on the ſame day, ordered the advanced works and traverſes of the enemy to be ſtormed. This ſervice was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in his preſence, with the greateſt reſolution and ſucceſs. The ground taken from the enemy, was inſtantly occupied with batteries. On the twenty-ſeventh of July, the King carried the firſt counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp; and the Elector of Bavaria, at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, found means to throw a bridge acroſs the Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, which facilitated the reduction of the place. The French behaved themſelves with an obſtinate bravery. But the allies, animated by the preſence of their leader, were irreſiſtible in their various attacks. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works were, at length, carried by the beſiegers. A practicable breach was made in the innermoſt wall.

Fifteen hundred houſes, and many public build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were laid in ruins. The Prince of Vaudemont was an eye-witneſs of a deſtruction, which he could neither prevent nor avenge. On the fifteenth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, the French general, being reinforced with a conſiderable body of troops, directed his march toward Namur. When he had advanced to Fleurus, he gave a ſignal of his approach to the beſieged, by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of ninety pieces of cannon.

On the twenty-ninth of Auguſt, De Villeroi advanced toward the allies. But he found them ſo well poſted, that he retired in the night, without noiſe.

The operations of the campaign ended with the ſurrender of the citadel. William quitted the field and retired to Dieren, and from thence to Loo. The command devolved upon the Elector of Bavaria. But the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſeparated, in the end of September.

One Paterſon, who had been the chief inſtrument in eſtabliſhing the bank of England, had framed a mercantile project of an extenſive kind for Scotland. Such Engliſh merchants, as had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto diſappointed in their ſchemes of forming a new

Eaſt India company, gave their countenance to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon's plan; which, from views of their own, was adopted, with ardour, by the Scottiſh miniſtry. The project was to eſtabliſh one ſettlement at Darien, on the eaſt ſide of the iſthmus of America; and another on the oppoſite ſide, toward the South Sea. This ſcheme was laid before the King, by ſecretary John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton. Inſtructions were prepared and ſigned, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering the commiſſioner to give his aſſent to any bill for the encouragement of trade. That nobleman, accordingly, communicated the King's intentions to the parliament. The bait was greedily ſeized. The people loſt their reſentment, in a condeſcenſion, which flattered their hopes of wealth. The parliament it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was all ſubmiſſion. A vote of condolence, for the death of the Queen, was inſtantly paſſed. They gave, at once, all the neceſſary ſupplies. The ways and means were a general poll-tax, a ſix-months ceſs out of the land-rents, and an additional exciſe<note n="Z" place="bottom">Proceedings of Scot. Parl.</note>.</p>

The artifice of the court-party could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the ſhocking circumſtances of that barbarous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. They, however, diverted, with ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of decency, the implication of guilt, from the King himſelf to Dalrymple, his acting miniſter upon that occaſion. The parliament voted the whole a murder. They addreſſed the King, for juſtice, on the offenders. But their application was couched in terms, which ſeemed to demand no compliance with their requeſt. William, accordingly, paid no atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their addreſs. He even continued his favour, without abatement, to the principal actors in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.

The commons reſolved to grant an immediate ſupply to the King, to diſcharge the debts of the crown, and to maintain the eſtabliſhed government. They found it leſs difficult to make the grant, than to find the ways and means. They agreed, at length, on a poll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill, and ſome additional cuſtoms. But as both were deemed inadequate to the ſum required, they reſolved to continue, to the end of the year 1698, the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal exciſe, which they had voted at the beginning only for a ſhort ſpace of time. A quarrel between the lord-deputy and the chancellor, filled the reſt of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0709200302:101"/>
the ſeſſion with debates, and a degree of confuſion. A motion was made by the party of the former, to impeach the latter for forming a new faction in the kingdom. But the chancellor was cleared of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by a great majority. The ſeſſion, however, ended in tranquillity; and, upon the whole, favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the lord-deputy.

His friends in England ceaſed not, however, to urge him to an attempt on that kingdom. The Earl of Arran endeavoured to rouze him with letters.

He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the late King, early in the ſeaſon, that the Engliſh fleet were deſtined to attack Toulon.

Strangers to the ſituation of the mind of James, and ignorant of the diſpoſition of France, they endeavoured to rouze the firſt with every poſſible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to make a deſcent in England.

The manifeſt decline in the health of William, his loſs of influence by the death of Mary, the diſtreſs and conſequent diſcontent of the nation, their murmurs againſt the late heavy taxes, their fears of future bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, were either magnified or recounted with ardour. James was aſſured, by his adherents, that, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſtate of affairs and opinions, ten thouſand men would be ſufficient to eſtabliſh him again on his throne. They affirmed, that the whole force in England, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only of nine thouſand men. That the nation was divided into three parties.

The court of Rome itſelf had forgot the orthodoxy of James, in his puſillanimity in quitting his dominions without a blow.

The enthuſiaſm which had deprived him of his throne, was conſtrued into an incurable folly, by the more ſenſible part of his own perſuaſion. A kind of WICKED policy, as the Pope, perhaps ludicrouſly ſaid, had ſuperſeded every idea of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0709200302:104"/>
religion among the Catholic powers, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the grand alliance. Innocent the Twelfth himſelf, though the ſat in St. Peter's chair, was ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by temporal views, from entertaining any favour for a Prince who had ſacrificed his crown to a blind attachment to the Romiſh faith. He received the Earl of Perth, who had been ſent in the character of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, by James, with manifeſt coldneſs; or treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with ſeeming ridicule. The utmoſt that the moſt preſſing ſolicitations could obtain from that Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, amounted only to a compliment. He aſſured the Earl of Perth, that the would never concur in a peace, which tended to deprive a Catholic Prince of his juſt rights. But Innocent and all his court were in the intereſt of the houſe of Auſtria; and thus James, though a very faithful ſon of the church, loſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with the holy Father, through his dependence on France<note n="M" place="bottom">Perth's letter, Stuart-papers, 1695.</note>.</p>

In a council held on the evening of his arrival, he reſolved to diſſolve the parliament; and to order another to meet, on the twenty-ſecond of November. The Earl of Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in concert with the court of St. Germains, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed this meaſure<note n="N" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1695.</note>. The former parliament, from their liberal grants to the Crown, were become odious to the people; and the latter, therefore, were not likely to chuſe again repreſentatives ſo compliant to the views of the King. But William beheld the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in another light. The popularity which he thought he derived from the glory of a ſucceſsful campaign, induced him to hope for a return of members more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to his intereſt, than thoſe who had lately

But his want of affability, his frigid manner, and dry addreſs, were not calculated either to gain the favour of the populace, or to retain it when gained. A viſit which he paid to the Earl of Sunderland at Althorp, was conſtrued, by his enemies, into gratitude for former favours; while his precipitate retreat from Oxford, for fear of being poiſoned<note n="O" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note> at an entertainment prepared by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, was conſidered as unworthy of his known pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and uſual courage.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A ſupply voted.</note> On the ſecond of December, the commons voted the ſupply for the war. Two millions five hundred thouſand pounds were aſſigned to the navy<note n="R" place="bottom">Journals, Dec. 6.</note>; two millions for the ſupport of an army of eighty-ſeven thouſand men. Though theſe ſums were great, they were leſs than the demands of the Crown. There was, beſides, an arrear of deficiency, for which no proviſion was made. But before the ſupply was fixed upon adequate funds, a matter of the laſt importance employed the attention of the commons. The act paſſed in the preceding ſeſſion of parliament, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the clipping and exportation of ſilver coin, had been found inadequate to the purpoſe. The evil had riſen to too great a height to be removed by ſlight remedies. The lords went firſt upon the buſineſs.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0709200302:107"/>
They prepared an addreſs, to which they deſired the concurrence of the commons, to requeſt the King to put a ſtop, by proclamation, to the currency of clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped crowns and half-crowns. The commons choſe to proceed in their own way. They went into a committee of the whole houſe, to deliberate on the ſtate of the nation with reſpect to the current coin<note n="S" place="bottom">Journals.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Debates</note> Individuals differed much in their opinions, upon a ſubject in which the intereſts of all were ſo deeply concerned. It appeared, from various experiments, that the ſilver coins, on a medium, were diminiſhed at leaſt one third. In proportion as the intrinſic of ſilver ſunk beneath its nominal value, the gold roſe. Two evils, with equal violence, preſſed the nation on either ſide. A remedy muſt be inſtantly applied. The firſt queſtion propoſed to the commons was, whether it was expedient to re-coin the ſilver money. The houſe was divided upon the ſubject. The opponents of the Court oppoſed the re-coinage, with ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious arguments. They affirmed, that the preſent conjuncture was by no means fit for a meaſure, whoſe operations muſt give ſo general and ſo violent a ſhock to the nation. They obſerved, that the people, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the calamity and expence of a burdenſome and doubtful war. That the nation as yet unſettled in their opinions with regard to the preſent eſtabliſhment, might be provoked by this new grievance to unhinge the government. That though things might be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged and accommodated at home, it would be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, if not impoſſible, to maintain either commerce or war abroad. That a preſent re-coinage would moſt certainly ſuſpend all the operations of trade, for the want of mutual payments; and they concluded with affirming, that the people, in their deſpair, might be hurried into the moſt dreadful extremities.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">on the coin-act.</note> The neceſſity of a ſpeedy remedy was argued by the other ſide. They obſerved, that the bad ſtate of the coin, had turned the exchange of all Europe, in an alarming degree, againſt the nation. That, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſupplies voted for the ſupport of the army
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0709200302:108"/>
abroad, would never anſwer their end. That gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, by this growing evil, were already advanced to thirty ſhillings; and foreign gold in the ſame extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant proportion. That all Europe ſent their gold, as the moſt valuable of all commodities, into our market. That gold, at laſt, would remain the ſole currency for trade in the kingdom. But that it could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that other nations would receive that commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity at the value which it bore in this kingdom. They concluded with affirming, that the evil would gather additional ſtrength every day. That the contagion had already ſpread through every vein of commerce; and that unleſs a ſpeedy and powerful remedy ſhould be applied, the certain diſſolution of the ſtate advanced with haſty ſtrides.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A bill paſſed.</note> The queſtion whether the ſtandard of the ſeveral denominations of the new money ſhould continue the ſame, produced many and vehement debates. Some affirmed, that as the price of ſilver was raiſed<note n="T" place="bottom">To ſix ſhillings and three-pence.</note>, the ſtandard ſhould be proportionably increaſed. They argued, that the meaſure would prevent the exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the coin, and the melting of it down, as had been practiſed for ſeveral years. They urged, at the ſame time, that people would be induced to bring their plate and bullion to the mint, from views of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The majority, with more reaſon, aſſerted, that it was impoſſible the price of ſilver could either riſe or fall in reſpect of itſelf. That the alteration in the price of bullion, was merely relative to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed money; and they affirmed, in ſupport of their poſition, that an ounce of bullion could be actually bought, at that very time, for five ſhillings and two pence of new-milled money. As to the exportation of the coin, they juſtly obſerved, that nothing could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually prevent that evil, but a ſuperiority in trade over other nations. The arguments for a new coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, on the old ſtandard, at length prevailed. The preſent inconvenience was deemed leſs dangerous, than the future evils which were juſtly to be apprehended. The commons reſolved to put a ſtop to the currency, and to proceed to a new coinage with the utmoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

But the wiſdom of that aſſembly could not prevent a general loſs of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, which ſhook the government, while it diſtreſſed the nation. Another affair of importance employed a part of the attention of both houſes, during the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, on the coin. On the fourteenth of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note n="V" place="bottom">Dec. 14.</note>, the lords ſent down to the commons an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the King, againſt an act paſſed in the Scotiſh parliament, for erecting a company trading to Africa and the Eaſt-Indies. The commons concurred with the peers. The two houſes attended the King with their addreſs. His anſwer was, that he had been ill-ſerved in Scotland. But that he hoped ſome remedy might be found to the evil of which they complained. This indefinite reply was not ſufficient to ſatisfy the commons. <note place="margin">1696</note> They reſolved, that the directors of the Scotiſh company ſhould be impeached of high crimes and miſdemeanors.

He ordered his ſervants to oppoſe the bill, with all the influence of office. But the current of public opinion was turned toward new regulations, for the protection and encouragement of commerce. The waſte occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the war, the loſs by captures at ſea, and the late diſaſters on that element, had raiſed general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and produced many petitions. The enemies of William took advantage of the vehemence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Even ſome of his ſuppoſed friends and actual favourites promoted a meaſure, which he avowedly diſapproved. The Earl of Sunderland, with all his adherents, declared for the bill. The King aſcribed the conduct of this nobleman to his fears from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular party. But he was in a ſecret correſpondence with James; and he had promiſed to oppoſe the meaſures of William in parliament<note n="X" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1695.</note>.</p>

Bentinck, whom William had created Earl of Portland, retained in England that aſcendency in the favour of his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he had acquired in Holland. He had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, from the King, a grant of the lordſhips of Denbigh, Bromfield, and Yale, in the county of Denbigh, and a part of the ancient demeſnes of the Prince of Wales. The gentleman of the county had oppoſed the warrant for the grant, in the treaſury. They followed it, with their oppoſition, to the office of the Earl of Pembroke, who was then lord-privy-ſeal. This nobleman was, at the time, in correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the late King. He heard the petitioners with a ſeeming candour which bordered on favour. The affair was permitted to lie dormant. But the warrant was not re-called. The gentlemen of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigh carried their complaints before parliament. Mr. Price, afterwards a baron of the exchequer, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the petition with a ſpirited, but vehement and bitter ſpeech. The houſe, warmed to a degree of

The nation, diſtreſſed by an adulterated and diminiſhed currency, offended at the captures made upon their commerce at ſea, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the enormous expence of the war by land, placed all their misfortunes to the account of the King's predilection for other intereſts than thoſe of England.

But he joined not his troops till the ſixth of June. The French had taken the field, with two armies. One, under Mareſchal de Villeroi, was poſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mechlen and Deynſe. The Mareſchal de Boufflers commanded another, between Flerus and Sombref. The King oppoſed, in perſon, the enemy at Mariekirke, with one army. The Elector of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia aſſembled another in the neighbourhood of Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain. The whole ſummer either paſſed in inaction, or was waſted in motions, which neither promiſed nor produced any important event. Though no congreſs was opened, the expectations of peace ſuſpended the operations of war. The allies were in no condition to puſh, with vigour, the advantages which they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the preceding campaign; and France, in her preſent condition, conſidered her being able to protect her conqueſts, an advantage equal to the glory of a victory.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Operations on the ſide of Spain.</note> To avail himſelf of the weakneſs of Spain, the French King bent his principal efforts towards that ſide. A diſpute with the Court of Madrid, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Jew, who had ſerved him in quality of an agent, had contributed to induce William to withdraw all the naval force of the Engliſh from the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean. But the French, having ordered the ſquadron at Toulon to fail into the ocean, were incapable of inſulting the coaſt of Spain, though expoſed. They, however, puſhed with ſome vigour their operations by land. The Duke de Vendôme, who commanded in Catalonia, was ordered to take the field. He paſſed the Ter, on the the thirtieth of May. He attacked the Prince of Heſſe Darmſtadt, on the banks of that river, and forced him to retire with loſs under the cannon of Oſtalric. An inactive campaign ſucceeded this undeciſive engagement. The hopes of an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate peace, and the proſpect of future advantages, roſe to France on the ſide of Spain. The Queen-mother,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0709200302:121"/>
who, as a daughter of Auſtria, had carried the ammoſities of her family againſt France, into the councils of Charles the ſecond, was lately dead.

The French and Imperialiſts alternately paſſed and repaſſed, to little purpoſe, the Rhine. The efforts of the maritime powers at ſea, were as languid and undeciſive as their operations by land. Sir George Rooke, upon his return from Cadiz, where he had wintered with his ſquadron, was appointed commander in chief of the combined fleet. Having, in vain, endeavoured to intercept the French fleet, upon its way from Toulon to Breſt, he returned to Torbay, on the twenty-third of May, and he was re-called by the lords of the regency from his command. The lord Berkley, who ſucceeded Rooke, performed nothing of any importance. The moſt remarkable tranſaction of this ſummer at ſea, was performed by Du Bart; who had ſailed with a French ſquadron from Dunkirk, in the end of May. He fell in, on the eighth of June, with a fleet of Dutch merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from the Baltic, under the convoy of five men of war. The latter he took, after an obſtinate reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Thirty of the former fell alſo into his hands.

Europe. A peace, between the French and the Duke of Savoy, changed the whole face of affairs in Italy. This pacification, which greatly diſconcerted the allies, had been long negociated by the Count de Teſsè, as intermediate agent between the Duke and the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal de Catinat, who commanded the French troops on the ſide of Savoy. De Catinat made the firſt offer of peace, on the ſixth of June. The Duke, willing to ſecure the ſupplies of the year from England and Holland, concealed, for ſome time, the treaty, after it was actually ſigned<note n="D" place="bottom">May 30th.</note>. When he profeſſed to avow the conditions, they only ſeemed to comprehend the neutrality of Italy. He ſuppreſſed the terms, which concerned his own intereſt.

                  <note place="margin">Advances toward a peace.</note> The defection of the Duke of Savoy, while it much offended all the confederates, rendered the maritime powers, in particular, very deſirous of peace. William had various reaſons to wiſh for an immediate pacification with France. The failure of the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, on which he had ſo much credit, the conſequent difficulty of preſent remittances, the uncertainty of future ſupplies, the example of Savoy, for further deſertions from the common cauſe, the diſpoſition of the States againſt the continuance of a burdenſome war, the clamours of the Engliſh, under their heavy taxes, all combined to make the re-eſtabliſhment of the tranquility of Europe an object of importance to the King. He, therefore, proſecuted with ſincerity every meaſure to accompliſh his views. He concurred with the States, in appointing Dykveldt to confer with Callieres, who had, for ſome time, carried on in Holland ſecret negociations leading to a peace. On the twenty-fourth of Auguſt, Dykveldt communicated the whole proceedings to the deputies of the States for foreign affairs. The deputies made their report, on the third of September, to the States-General; who
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0709200302:123"/>
came to a reſolution, that the conceſſions of France to the demands of the Emperor, were ſufficient grounds for accepting the mediation of Sweden in concluding a general treaty of peace. The houſe of Auſtria, in neither of its branches, ſeemed willing to cloſe with the propoſal of the maritime powers. The court of Spain was offended with William.

The lords of the regency applied their chief attention to the re-coinage of the ſilver money; and to the operations of the fleet at ſea. In Scotland, a ſeſſion of parliament was held, on the eighth of September. The Lord Murray, eldeſt ſon of the Marquis of Athol, being created Earl of Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libardin, was appointed commiſſioner. The Earl of Arran, and other malcontents, took the oaths, for the firſt time, and their ſeats in the houſe.

An ill-humour had crept into parliament. The people were diſtreſſed with a general ſcarcity, which render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them clamorous and diſcontented.

King. He was taken, at New Romney, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding June, in endeavouring to make his eſcape to France. He was committed to Newgate, and a bill found againſt him by the grand jury<note n="K" place="bottom">June 11, 1696.</note>. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, or, at leaſt, to prolong his life, he fell upon the expedient of obtaining a pardon, as a price of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries to the King. Through the means of the Duke of Devonſhire, he conveyed a paper to William, when he was in Flanders, containing an account of correſpondences and intrigues, carried on with the court of St. Germains, by the Duke of Shrewſbury, the Earls of Bath and Marlborough, the Lord Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin, and Admiral Ruſſel. Though this account is known, now, to be true, in every particular, it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gained William's favour nor ſerved the deſign of Fenwick. The perſons accuſed were too powerful to be puniſhed. Beſides, Fenwick had refuſed to be an evidence; and had he done otherwiſe, the proofs, which he could produce, were not ſufficient in law. His trial, however, was delayed, by various means, till the King's arrival in England. His friends in the mean time, removed one of the two witneſſes, on whoſe oaths the bill had been found; and, according to the ſtatutes of treaſon, a ſingle witneſs was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to condemn.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Sunderland in office.</note> An event, which happened three days after the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of parliament, rendered remarkable the paragraph with which his Majeſty cloſed his ſpeech. To the aſtoniſhment of the nation, he raiſed the Earl of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland to the office of lord-chamberlain, in the room of the Earl of Dorſet; who had ſuffered himſelf to be bought out of his place, with the public money. That this lord uniformly betrayed the late King to the views of the preſent, when Prince of Orange, is now known, and was, even then, ſuſpected, by the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent. There ſeemed, therefore, to have been a degree of imprudence, in the appointment, though the place, which he held before in William's favour, entitled him to a part of the management of public affairs. On the twenty-ſecond of April, the earl was ſworn a privy-councillor, and, as ſuch, took his place at the board. He was comprehended in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of lords-juſtices; and, though at the time in correſpondence with James<note n="T" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1696.

                  <note place="margin">Congreſs at Riſwick.</note> On the twenty-fourth of April, the King left Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington, and arrived, on the twenty-ſeventh, at the Hague. The advances made toward a peace, in the end of the preceding ſummer, were improved in the winter. William had named, in the month of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, three plenipotentiaries to negociate a treaty. The French King had appointed two perſons, in the like capacity, to be joined to Calliers, who had long carried on a negociation at the Hague. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and the court of Spain threw various objections in the way. But theſe being, at length, over-ruled, by the reſt of the allies, a congreſs was agreed to be opened, under the mediation of Charles the Eleventh, King of Sweden. That Prince dying, in the mean time, the office of mediator was transferred to his ſon. The ambaſſadors of the belligerent powers met,

Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Holland had ſcarce any farther concern in the treaty, than to ſettle a barrier in Flanders, and to procure an ample acknowledgment of William's right to the throne. Calliers, then ſole plenipotentiary for Lewis the Fourteenth in Holland, had conſented, as early as the tenth of February, to preliminaries, which declared, that Straſbourg ſhould be reſtored to the Emperor, Mons, Charleroi, Dinant, and the whole duchy of Luxembourg, together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in Catalonia to the Spaniards, the duchy of Lorrain to its native Prince; and that the title of William ſhould be acknowledged, without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of difficulty, reſtriction, condition or reſerve. But that the claims of other Princes ſhould be left to be ſettled, by the treaty for a general peace, to be negociated under the mediation of the King of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

They kept their ſovereign a kind of priſoner, in his own palace; and governed, in his name, a kingdom long exhauſted by a ſucceſſion of wretched councils. The treaty of Nimeguen having eſtabliſhed a good underſtanding between the courts of Madrid and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles, the King married Maria-Louiſa, daughter of the Duke of Orleans. This princeſs, unambitious of governing a weak huſband, left him, at firſt, in the hands of his miniſters; and her interference, at length, in favour of France, proved fatal to herſelf. In the beginning of the year 1689, England and Holland, in alliance with the Emperor, reſolved to draw Spain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the war againſt Lewis the Fourteenth.

She deſired to know his pleaſure, whether he would permit her to aſcend the throne, according to the act of ſettlement, ſhould the Prince of Orange, ſo ſhe called King William, happen to die.

The reaſoning of the Princeſs was too refined, for the temper of her father. He told his friends, that though he could ſuffer injuſtice, he could never be perſuaded to give it countenance.

The Earl of Portland, on the part of the King of England, and de Boufflers, in the name of Lewis, met between the armies and held a conference, in the open field, on the tenth of July. They met again, on the fifteenth and twentieth of the ſame month, in the ſame manner. But, on the twenty-ſixth of July and the ſecond of Auguſt, they retired to a houſe in the ſuburbs of Hall; and reduced to writing the terms to which they had agreed in the field<note n="H" place="bottom">Depôt des Affaires Etran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geres à Verſailles.</note>.</p>

of England, after the death of William. The King, with little heſitation, agreed to this requeſt. He e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſolemnly engaged, to procure the repeal of the act of ſettlement; and to declare, by another, the Prince of Wales his ſucceſſor in the throne<note n="I" place="bottom">James II. 1697.</note>. This great preliminary being ſettled, other matters of leſs importance followed of courſe. The fifty thouſand pounds a year, ſettled as a jointure upon King James's Queen, was agreed to be paid; though the money was afterwards retained upon various pretences. On the third of Auguſt, the King left the army and retired to Dieren. He ſent from thence the Earl of Portland, to acquaint the miniſters aſſembled at the congreſs, that he had ſettled his own affairs, and thoſe of his kingdoms, with France; and that he earneſtly preſſed the allies, and particularly the Emperor, to haſten the concluſion of the great work of peace.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reflections on that tranſaction.</note> Thoſe who aſcribe all the actions of William to public ſpirit, will find ſome difficulty in reconciling this tranſaction to their elevated opinion of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. In one conceſſion to France, he yielded all his profeſſions to England; and, by an act of indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or through indifference, deſerted the principles to which he owed the throne. The deliverance of the nation was not, however, the ſole object of this Prince. Like other men, he was ſubject to human paſſions; and, like them, when he could gratify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſerved the world. Various motives ſeem to have concurred, to induce him to adopt a meaſure, unaccountable on other grounds. The projected peace was to ſecure the crown in his poſſeſſion for his life. He had no children, and but few relations; and thoſe he never loved. The ſucceſſors provided by the act of ſettlement, he either deſpiſed or abhorred; and he ſeems hitherto not to have extended his views beyond the limits of that act. Though James had diſpleaſed the nation, he had not injured William. The ſon had offended neither. He might excite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, but he could be no object of averſion. The ſuppoſed ſpuriouſneſs of his birth, had been only held
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0709200302:137"/>
forth to amuſe the vulgar; and even theſe would be convinced, by the public acknowledgment intended to be made by the very perſon whoſe intereſt was moſt concerned in the ſupport of that idle tale.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal rejected by James.</note> But the ſame imprudence which loſt to the late King the crown, excluded, for ever, his poſterity from the throne. He told his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, who had made the firſt overture to him, on this important ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that though he could ſuffer with patience the uſurpation of his nephew upon his right, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permit his own ſon to be guilty of the ſame injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice<note n="K" place="bottom">James II. 1697.</note>. He urged, that ſhould the ſon reign in his father's life-time, that circumſtance would amount to a formal renunciation. That the Prince of Wales, by ſucceeding to the Prince of Orange, would yield his ſole right, which was that of his father; and being obliged to the people for his elevation, the hands which had raiſed him, might, at any time, juſtly pull him down from his throne. That ſhould he himſelf be capable of conſenting to ſuch a diſgraceful propoſal, in favour of his ſon, he might be juſtly reproached with departing from his avowed principles, and with ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monarchy, by rendering elective an hereditary crown. Beſides, that though he ſhould conſent to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice all that he reckoned dear, to a mortal enemy, the Prince of Orange could only promiſe a thing, which he was not, perhaps, able to perform. That the ſame parliament that had conferred the royal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on himſelf, had ſettled the reverſion of the crown on the Princeſs of Denmark; and that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by reverſing the act of ſettlement, he disjointed the whole chain which bound the people to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But that ſhould even the Prince of Orange induce the parliament of England to repeal the act of ſettlement, it would be always upon condition of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince of Wales placed in their hands, without their being able to give any ſecurity either for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or his conſcience<note n="L" place="bottom">Memorial to the Pope, 1697.

The French King, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his obſtinacy, urged not further a point, of which James himſelf could be the only judge. The latter endeavoured, in the mean time, to ſtop the progreſs of a treaty, with vain proteſts, and with unavailing memorials and remonſtrances to the confederate Princes. The demand of France, for the eventual ſucceſſion of the Prince of Wales, being removed, the re-eſtabliſhment of peace, between Lewis and William, became abſolutely certain. The firſt, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more peremptory in his negociations with the Empire and Spain, as the allies were already apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſunited, he ordered his miniſters, at the congreſs, to deliver in the project of a general peace, upon the footing of the preliminaries<note n="M" place="bottom">July 20.</note>. The project was accompanied with a declaration, limiting the time of its being accepted, to the laſt day in Auguſt. The houſe of Auſtria were as dilatory in their motions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a peace, as they had been ſlow in proſecuting the war. They paid no regard to the limitations offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by France, though they were in no condition for maintaining themſelves ſingly againſt her power. Spain had added to her misfortunes at home, a diſtaſter of an alarming king abroad. A French ſquadron, under De Pontis, had, with the aſſiſtance of the buccaniers, taken Carthagena in America, plundered the place of an immenſe treaſure, and having eſcaped the utmoſt efforts and vigilance of the Engliſh ſleet, arrived ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Breſt, on the nineteenth of Auguſt.</p>

That, therefore, he earneſtly preſſed the allies, and particularly the Emperor, to contribute all that lay in their power toward concluding ſo great a work. This declaration of the King, was regarded as a command. The plenipotentiaries of the States ſigned the treaty, on the ninth of September, about mid-night. Their example was taken in an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the ambaſſador of Spain; and he was followed by the plenipotentiaries of England.

In leſs than an hour, reſiſtance was over, on the ſide of the Turks, but the reſt of the day was ſpent in butchery and blood.

freedom was always ruined by armies. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Venice and the States of the United Provinces, as examples of this poſition; and they endeavoured to prove, that the liberties of France fell, through the dark policy of Lewis the Eleventh, and not by the means of a military force. They attempted to raiſe the fears of the people, by explaining the facility with which the late King might return. They repreſented the diſaffection of a part of the nation, as too ſtrong to be ſuppreſſed without the terrors of a ſtanding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

They affirmed, that the fitting out of a fleet was a work of time. That the preparations of the kingdom might, in a great meaſure, keep pace with thoſe of the invaders. That the confederates would either call the attention of France to another quarter, or ſhe might be oppoſed with effect, on the coaſt of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by troops called from Scotland and Ireland. They affirmed, that no wind could ariſe more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the French, in quitting their principal ports, than to the Engliſh in ſailing from their own. Beſides, that, merely for the bare poſſibility of ſuch a circumſtance, no Prince could be ſuppoſed to hazard a vaſt expence, upon one improbable contingency. That the examples of Venice, Holland, and France, were inapplicable to the preſent argument. That the two republics kept their ſtanding forces only in their conquered countries. That though Lewis the Eleventh invaded the liberties of his ſubjects, without public violence, a ſtanding army was ſoon found neceſſary to ſupport the uſurpations of the crown, on the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rights of the people. They urged, with great force of argument, that a militia was the moſt natural and leaſt dangerous protectors of the kingdom; as the gentry, freeholders, and traders of England, were more

They averred, that the moſt likely way to reſtore the late King, was to ſupport a ſtanding force to defeat his deſigns. To prove this poſition, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the affection of the people was the only rock on which the throne of the Prince could remain firm. That when it leans on a ſtanding force, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the unſteady humours of the ſoldiery. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution and change, they ſhewed, from the examples of former ages, had proceeded oftener from the caprice of an army, than from the violence and inconſtancy of the multitude. They alleged, that the fate of the kingdom would depend on the political principles, or the avarice of the chief officers. That one might be ſwayed by an affection for the late King, another gained with French money. They deſcended to all the inconveniencies, ariſing from ſtanding armies. They mentioned quarrels, aſſaſſinations, robberies, the diſhonouring of women, the inſolence to men, their injuſtice to mankind in general, the licence derived from the pride of their ſtation, their contempt for laws, by which they ceaſed to be confined. They, however, concluded, that it was, by no means, their deſign, to ruin, by the peace, thoſe who had deſerved ſo well of the nation, by their courage, fidelity, and conduct in the war. That their arguments were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected againſt the thing itſelf, and not againſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men; and that, therefore, the officers ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, from the parliament, a recompence for the loſs of their commiſſions<note n="Y" place="bottom">Journals.</note>.</p>

upbraided the King himſelf with a breach of faith to the nation. They obſerved, that, in his declaration when Prince of Orange, he promiſed, upon the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the nation, to ſend back all his foreign forces. But that, inſtead of adhering to his ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſtill retained a great number of aliens about his perſon. That of his countrymen, the Dutch, he had a troop of horſe, of two hundred and twenty men; and one regiment of body-guards of the ſame nation, conſiſting of four battalions, amounting to more than two thouſand ſix hundred ſoldiers. That he had alſo, in the ſame capacity, one regiment of Scots, conſiſting of one thouſand ſix hundred men; and that of French refugees, who depended on himſelf alone, he had two regiments of dragoons and three of foot, falling in all little ſhort of five thouſand men. The diſaffected exaggerated greatly the dangers to be apprehended from theſe troops. They compared them to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian bands, who executed the tyrannical decrees of the worſt Emperors of Rome; and even to the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Janizaries, who, by being cut off, in their infancy, from all connexions with the reſt of mankind, know no umpire but the ſword, and own no ties but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſubmiſſion to the will of the reigning Prince<note n="Z" place="bottom">Trenchard's Remarks.</note>.</p>

his reſentment in complaints, his chief adviſer, the Earl of Sunderland, yielded to his own fears. He had ſupported, with all his eloquence, the arguments for a ſtanding army.

That the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abhorred him for his treachery to that Prince. He, therefore, reſolved to prevent the falling of the ſtorm, by reſigning the office of lord-chamberlain<note n="B" place="bottom">Dec. 26.</note>, and retiring into the country.

He inſinuated, at the ſame time, to ſuch members as ſtill retained ſome regard for the late King, that he had promiſed to pay to the exiled Queen her jointure, amounting to fifty thouſand pounds, in conſequence of an agreement with France at the treaty of Riſwick. This precaution facilitated the grant of an addition of one hundred thouſand pounds a year to the civil liſt. He, however, found means to retain, in his own hands, the money deſtined for the Queen. The Earl of Portland, being ſent ambaſſador to Paris, in the beginning of the year, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that, in the conferences between himſelf and the Mareſchal de Boufflers, the latter had promiſed ſecretly, that King James ſhould be removed from St. Germains.

But Lewis the Fourteenth was not in a diſpoſition to argue the matter with Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am<note n="M" place="bottom">James II. 1697.</note>. The King obſerved the ſame ſtrain of oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy with regard to the Duke of Glouceſter.

Finding it needleſs to treat with the Emperor, he diſcovered an inclination to enter into treaty with the King of England. But the unexpected demands of Portland obſtructed, for ſome time, the deſigns of Lewis. The Earl plainly told that Prince, that he did not expect to find King James at St. Germains. He complained of that circumſtance as a breach of a promiſe made by the Mareſchal de Boufflers, in their conſerences in Flanders. The Mareſchal denied the

The commons choſe Sir Thomas Littleton for their ſpeaker. The King approved their choice, on the ninth of the month, and made a ſpeech from the throne.

Two things, he told them, ſeemed to demand their conſideration, to acquire that deſirable end: What ſtrength ought to be maintained at ſea? What force to be kept up by land? He obſerved, that the flouriſhing of trade, the ſupporting of credit, the quieting the minds of the people at home, and the weight and influence of England abroad, depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the opinion the nation and foreigners ſhould form of the ſecurity of the kingdom. He recommended to the commons, to make ſome farther progreſs in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the debts contracted in a long and expenſive war; and he concluded, with obſerving, that as the things he had mentioned were of common concern, he could not but hope for unanimity and diſpatch<note n="L" place="bottom">Dec. 9.</note>.</p>

The commons, in particular, were ſo much incenſed at his ſpeech, that, contrary to the uſual cuſtom of their houſe, they voted no addreſs.

That he was employed neither in the concerns of the people, as King, nor in the affairs of the States, as Stadtholder.

But the expedient was now too ſeale, either to alarm the fears of the people, or to gain the favour of parliament. Prudence, at length, overcame ſome part of the reſentment of William.

He informed his parliament, that he came to paſs the bill, as ſoon as he underſtood it was ready to receive his aſſent. That though there appeared great hazard in diſbanding ſuch a number of troops, in the preſent ſtate of affairs; and that though he might think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unkindly treated, in being deprived of thoſe guards who had come along with him from Holland to the aid of England, and who had attended him in all the actions in which he had been engaged, yet, being convinced of the fatal conſequences of any jealouſies that might ariſe between himſelf and his people, he was reſolved, for that reaſon only, to give his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the bill. He, however, informed them, that he thought himſelf obliged, for his own juſtification, and in diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in his hands, to declare plainly his judgment, that the nation was left too much expoſed. He deemed it, therefore, incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon them, as the repreſentatives of the people, to provide ſuch a force as ſhould be neceſſary for the ſafety of the kingdom, and the preſervation of the peace of Europe.</p>

The neceſſary orders were, in the mean time, iſſued for diſbanding the army. But his predilection for his favourite Dutch guards, recurred again to the King's mind. On the eighteenth of March he ſent a meſſage, written in his own hand, to the houſe of commons, by the Earl of Ranelagh, paymaſter-general of the forces<note n="S" place="bottom">March 18.</note>.

would conſtrue into an act of great kindneſs. This condeſcending expedient produced no favourable effect on the commons. The queſtion, that a day ſhould be appointed for conſidering the meſſage, was carried in the negative. A committee was appointed to frame an addreſs, repreſenting the reaſons why the commons could not comply. The addreſs was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly preſented on the twenty-fourth of March. The anſwer of William contained a recapitulation of his own ſervices to the nation, his confidence in their fidelity to his perſon, and his reſolution to preſerve entire the conſtitution which he had reſtored<note n="T" place="bottom">March 24.</note>.</p>

Though William yielded to his prudence, he could neither conceal his reſentment nor ſuppreſs his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, for the unkind treatment which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the commons. He furniſhed an example of both in his ſpeech from the throne, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued the parliament. In any light in which the ſubject is viewed, the King had little reaſon to be pleaſed. But the ſallies of paſſion, into which he is ſaid to have fallen, require better authorities than thoſe by which they are ſupported, to be implicitly believed. His diſappointments throughout furniſhed matter of triumph to his enemies. But they dwelt with moſt malevolence, on the ſuppoſed meanneſs of his meſſage to the commons, in favour of his Dutch guards. The conduct of the commons cannot, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, be diſapproved.

The empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his coffers, the diſcontents of his ſubjects, the ſeditious humour of the Janiſaries, had involved the latter Prince in unſurmountable difficulties, and had rendered him utterly incapable of recovering in the ſummer of 1698, the laurels which he had loſt in the preceding campaign<note n="B" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, tom. iii.</note>. The eyes of both parties being turned to the ſame object, they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with covering their reſpective frontiers with their armies.

He informed the lords of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, that it ought not to have been preſumed, that the King of Spain had not taken proper meaſures againſt all accidents that might diſturb the public peace, and break the repoſe of Europe. That unleſs a ſtop ſhould be put to theſe ſiniſter proceedings, theſe clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine machinations, theſe unjuſt projects, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal war muſt be the conſequence throughout Europe.

The King, at the ſame time, ordered his ambaſſador at the court of Madrid to complain of the affront of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his perſon, and the reflections thrown on his government.

His attention was not confined to the ſubject of the Spaniſh ſucceſſion, though the declining health of Charles the Second threatened Europe with thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which it then feared, and ſoon after experienced from his death. The King employed his good offices in ſuppreſſing a flame, which ſeemed ready to be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the North. Chriſtian the Fifth, King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, dying on the fourth of September, was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the throne by his ſon Frederic the fourth. Frederic inheriting the reſentment, and purſuing the deſigns of his father againſt the Duke of Holſtein-Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp, began to make great preparations, both by ſea and land, to reduce that Prince to thoſe terms which he pretended to have a right to exact. The Duke on the other hand, had ſtrengthened his intereſt by a marriage with the Princeſs-Royal of Sweden. He himſelf was commander in chief of the troops of that kingdom; and he had obtained a force from his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, Charles the Twelfth, to defend himſelf againſt the deſigns of Denmark. William, in his double capacity of King of England, and Stadtholder of the United Provinces, conſidered himſelf as gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee of the treaty of Altena; and, to ſecure the tranquillity of the North, he propoſed that the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh troops ſhould retire from Holſtein. The King of Sweden and the Duke accepted the propoſal of the mediator. But the King of Denmark, having pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately entered into an alliance, againſt Sweden, with

Montagu explained this certain perſon into the King. The houſe ordered him to make good his charge. He endeavoured, in vain, to avoid an anſwer. But being threatened with the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he named Methuen, lord-chancellor of Ireland, as the informer. Methuen denied the charge. Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu became the victim of his own zeal; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons voted that his report was falſe and ſcandalous. They reſolved, at the ſame time, that the four com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, who had ſigned the report concerning the Iriſh forfeitures, had acquitted themſelves with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, courage, and integrity. They, at the ſame time, committed Sir Richard Leving to the Tower, as a perſon who had thrown a groundleſs and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aſperſion on the four commiſſioners<note n="W" place="bottom">Journals, Jan. 1700.</note>.</p>

The grand committee for trade had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined into ſeveral piracies, comitted in the Eaſt Indies, by one Captain Kidd and his crew. On this examination it appeared, that William had inadvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently made himſelf a kind of party in the affair, by ſigning a warrant, for the granting of pirates-goods to the Earl of Bellamount and ſeveral others. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſent an addreſs to the throne, that Kidd, who was ordered home from America, ſhould not be tried, diſcharged, or pardoned, until the next ſeſſion of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. This conduct in the houſe ſhewed a diſtruſt of the King, which raiſed his reſentment, as it hurt his pride. An enquiry into the ſtate of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the peace and lieutenancy, produced an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs<note n="C" place="bottom">April 1.</note>, that was not grateful to the King. The houſe repreſented, that to reſtore gentlemen of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and eſtates to theſe commiſſions, would much conduce to the good of the kingdom; and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that neither men of ſmall eſtates, nor diſſenting from the church of England, ſhould either be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued or appointed<note n="D" place="bottom">Journals.</note>.

The complicated bill, comprehending the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and ſupply, met with great oppoſition, in the upper houſe. Some had been gained by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the crown. Many diſapproved of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of tacking a foreign clauſe to a money-bill, as reducing the peers to a ſubſerviency to the factions and views of the commons. But the force of both parties, when joined, was not ſufficient to reject the bill. Amendments were, however, made with regard to the Iriſh forfeitures. But theſe amendments were

They ſhut themſelves up, after the ſecond conference with the lords, till ten at night; and ſeemed determined on the harſheſt means to force the court-party into compliance. In this important interval, the houſe reſolved to addreſs the King, that no perſon, not a native of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, except Prince George of Denmark, ſhould be admitted to his councils either in England or Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note n="E" place="bottom">April 10.</note>. William was not of a complexion to give a favourable anſwer, nor was he in a condition to refuſe the demands of the exaſperated commons. He ſent a private meſſage to his friends among the lords, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their oppoſition. The bill was immediately paſſed, without amendments; and to prevent the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the threatened ſtorm, he came ſuddenly to the houſe, gave his aſſent to the act of reſumption, and prorogued the parliament<note n="F" place="bottom">April 11.</note>, without any ſpeech from the throne.</p>

The commons being ſo refractory, the firſt application was made to the lords. Neither the influence of the crown, nor the prejudices of the houſe, againſt the new company, were capable of carrying the point againſt the Scots, without violent debates and long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays. An addreſs was, at length, ſent down to the commons, for their concurrence. But the commons were not in the humour of being complaiſant to the King. The enemies of William were pleaſed to ſee his affairs embroiled. Some apprehended, that there was a deſign to involve the two kingdoms in a quarrel; that the King might derive, from the neceſſity of the nation, that increaſe of the land forces, which had been ſo often denied to his earneſt ſolicitations to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The leaders of oppoſition were, by no means, inclined to remove the general diſcontent which had ſoured the temper of the Scots, againſt the King. The diſaffected members, in the mean time, propagated a report, that the oppoſition of the King to the Scotiſh company, proceeded neither from a regard to foreign treaties nor domeſtic advantage, but from an affection for the Dutch, whoſe trade along the Spaniſh main was in danger of being ruined,

The negociations for the ſecond partition of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of Spain proceeded.

In the month of October, the Emperor, after various evaſions, formally rejected every treaty of partition whatſoever; yet neither the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land nor the States ſhewed any eagerneſs to cloſe with France, upon the diſpoſition already agreed, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Spaniſh ſucceſſion.

The Archduke Charles was placed in the room of the electoral Prince of Bavaria, as heir of the kingdoms of Spain and the Indies.

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons having preſented Mr. Harley, whom they had choſen for their ſpeaker, the King made a ſpeech to both houſes, from the throne.

He earneſtly recommended that meaſure to their earlieſt care, as the happineſs of the nation and the ſecurity of religion, depended on an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and proper ſettlement of the crown. The death of the King of Spain, he ſaid, and the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſucceſſor, had made ſo great an alteration in foreign affairs, that he deſired the parliament to conſider very maturely their preſent ſtate; and that he doubted not, but their reſolutions would conduce to the intereſt and ſafety of England, the preſervation of the Proteſtant religion, and the peace of all Europe. Theſe things, he continued, were of ſuch weight, that he had called a new parliament, to obtain the more immediate ſenſe of the kingdom in ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conjuncture.

Though the ſame power which conferred on the Princeſs the ſucceſſion of the Crown, might, with equal juſtice, have placed any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on the throne, the parliament choſe to adhere, in ſome degree, to the royal blood, as committing the leaſt outrage on monarchy, to which a majority of themſelves were attached from principle. A different conduct might, for a time, have deprived the elected Sovereign of the reverence which moſt men, born under monarchies, pay to the hereditary line.

He accordingly recalled his ambaſſador from the court of France; and ſent directions to the lords juſtices to order Pouſſin, the French envoy, to quit England. Preparations for war were, in the mean time, made on every ſide. The King of Denmark ordered the troops, ſtipulated by the treaty of ſubſidy, to march through Holſtein and Hanover toward Flanders.

The ſeverity of that aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Kentiſh petitioners, their conteſts with the lords, their animadverſions on the foreign tranſactions of government were magnified, and introduced as proofs of their attachment to the exiled family.

He was carried to Hampton-court, and the bone was ſet; but, contrary to advice, he returned the ſame evening, in his coach to Kenſington.</p>

On the twenty-eighth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, the Gazette declared, in expreſs terms, that the King was perfectly recovered; and, on the ſame day, he ſent a meſſage to both houſes, concerning an union between the kingdoms of England and Scotland. On the firſt of March, the bill for attainting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prince of Wales, received the royal aſſent by commiſſion.

The aſthma, to which he had been always ſubject, increaſed. He breathed ſhort, and he was reſtleſs and feveriſh. The two houſes, in the mean time,

continued to ſit. The council was aſſembled to receive the reports of the phyſicians. But, even in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, it was maliciouſly remarked, that no Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of quality had any acceſs to the King's chamber. About five in the morning, of Sunday the eighth of March, his Majeſty received the ſacrament, from the hands of the Archbiſhop of Canterbury; and at eight he expired, in the arms of one of his pages. Some papers, which might throw conſiderable light on the hiſtory of this Prince, were, with his laſt breath, conſigned to the hands of the Earl of Albemarle; and they were probably deſtroyed by that lord. Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle, whoſe original office was that of a tranſcriber of letters, had been employed, in the preceding month, on a ſervice of the ſame kind. He had returned, on the ſeventeenth of February, from Holland, with all the ſecret correſpondences which had paſſed between the King and the Penſionary, under the ſuppoſition, that the latter was alſo dying.</p>

His political conduct, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his mind, have been variouſly and oppoſitely repreſented: a thing not ſurpriſing, in a country where writers have not been able to diveſt themſelves of the prejudices and partialities incident to party. In ſuch a jarring ſtate of opinions, this Prince muſt have been too much praiſed by the one ſide, and by the other as extravagantly condemned. The neareſt path to truth, muſt certainly lie between theſe two extremes. But that path, though obvious, has not, hitherto, been trod by hiſtorians; who have uniformly yielded to the prejudices of others, or have been ſwayed by their own.

his public conduct ought to terminate. Though he was brave in action, and loved war as an amuſement, he poſſeſſed not the talents of a great general, and he was too prodigal of the lives of men. Though he obtained the name of a deliverer in England, and though, in fact, he might be conſidered in that light, with regard to Europe, more is owing to his own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, than to a general love of mankind. In Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where he obtained the chief authority, in a time of public diſtreſs, he frequently exerciſed his power in a manner inconſiſtent with the rights of a free ſtate<note n="Z" place="bottom">D'Avaux.</note>. In England, he ſcarce adhered in any thing, to the moderate declaration which paved his way to the throne. Though he obtained the crown by election, he ſhewed no diſpoſition to relinquiſh any of its hereditary ornaments; and though he affected to deſpiſe royalty, no Prince was ever more fond of the diſtinction paid to a King. His intrigues to expel his uncle from a throne, which he himſelf intended to mount, were by no means ſuitable with any ſtrict ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to virtue<note n="A" place="bottom">James II.

To gain to his intereſt the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of King James, may not have been inconſiſtent with thoſe allowances generally made for ambitious views. But there was a conſiderable degree of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, in his being acceſſary to the ſuggeſting of thoſe unpopular meaſures, which he turned, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, with ſo much ſucceſs, againſt that unfortunate as well as imprudent Monarch<note n="B" place="bottom">D'Avaux.

Upon the whole, if we muſt allow that King William, with all his faults, was a great Prince, it ought alſo to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that virtue was never an unſurmountable obſtacle to his ambition and views on power.</p>

She aſſured the two houſes, that as her own heart was entirely Engliſh, ſhe would agree to every thing that they could either expect or deſire for the happineſs and proſperity of England. The expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion manifeſtly regarded the too great attachment to his own countrymen, for which King William had been blamed.

The firſt part of the Queen's ſpeech contained the uſual aſſurances of a new reign. She agreed, ſhe ſaid, in ſentiments with with the concurrent addreſſes of the two houſes, that too much could not be done for the allies, to reduce the exorbitant power of France.

When ſhe came to the houſe of lords, on the thirtieth of March, to give the royal aſſent to the bill for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of her own revenue, ſhe made a ſpeech from the throne, calculated to gain popularity.

Two days after the death of William, ſhe condoled with the States of the Uuited Provinces upon that event, in a letter. She aſſured them, that as ſhe had ſucceeded the late King in his throne, ſhe would alſo ſucceed him in the ſame inclination, to a conſtant union and amity with their republic, as well as adherence to the late alliances. That ſhe would concur with the allies in general, in meaſures neceſſary for the preſervation of the common liberty of Europe, in reducing the power of France within proper bounds. That ſhe ſhould always look upon the intereſt of England and thoſe of the States as inſeparable, and united with ſuch ties as could not be broken, without the greateſt prejudice to the two nations. The Earl of Marlborough was probably the adviſer of meaſures, which he afterwards executed with ability. The attachment which this nobleman had uniformly ſhewn to the Queen, when ſhe was little reſpected by the nation and perſecuted by the court, had either excited ſentiments of gratitude or created principles of obedience to his inclinations in her mind.

                  <note place="margin">A ferment without doors.</note> The victory obtained by the Tories over the Whigs, by the ſucceſſion of a ſovereign of their own principles to the throne, produced a ferment without doors, though all things bore a face of harmony and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity within. Violent men of both parties carried their own prejudices, with indecent freedom, to the preſs; and diſgraced their converſation with mutual reflections of the worſt and moſt dangerous kind. The Whigs were openly accuſed of aiming at the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a commonwealth, by endeavouring to deprive the reigning Queen of the ſucceſſion to the throne. The memory of the late King was attacked with open aſſertions of the ſame kind; though it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that Prince was very indifferent about what perſon ſhould mount, after him, the throne. An en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quiry by the lords into this idle tale, produced only a negative proof of its not being founded in fact. They voted, upon an examination of King William's pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pers by a committee, that nothing appeared that tend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to the prejudice of her Majeſty, or her ſucceſſion to the crown.

The offices of the houſehold were filled with men of high principles for monarchy. The Lords Somers and Halifax, together with other leaders of the Whigs, were excluded from the new privy-council<note n="J" place="bottom">April 4.</note>; and their places ſupplied with eminent Tories. The Marquis of Normanby, remarkable for his attachment to her family, was raiſed to the office of lord privy-ſeal, by the Queen. But the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant promotion of all was that of the Lord Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin, to the ſtaff of lord high-treaſurer of England. Though Godolphin was well qualified for this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtation, he owed his office more to the influence of the Earl of Marlborough, than to his own merit. The connection, which had long ſubſiſted in political views, between theſe two noble perſons, had been lately more cloſely cemented, by the marriage of the ſon of the former with the eldeſt daughter of the latter. Their private intereſts being thus united, they carried forward, with harmony as well as abilities, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the public.</p>

The joy, therefore, which her elevation had raiſed among the diſcontented, ſoon declined. They appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, through their leaders, for the diſſolution of the convention-parliament. But they were oppoſed by the miniſters, who were afraid to venture upon the new choice of a people already inflamed. The Queen ſuffered herſelf to be perſuaded by the arguments of the latter, or to be ſwayed by her own fears. She continued the old parliament, which was appointed to meet on the ninth of June.

to finiſh that important treaty, that the whole fell for the time to the ground. The majority of the Scots had, in their diſguſt at the conduct of the late King, with regard to their commerce, forgot thoſe terrors for their religion, which had induced them to place the crown on his head. The Highlanders, eſpecially, who were never enthuſiaſts, had always ſuffered their high notions of hereditary right, to overcome their attachment to Preſbytery. The acceſſion of Anne, by bringing the throne nearer to the old ſtock, had eſtabliſhed in their minds a kind of certainty, that things were to return to their former channel. The aſſurances given by them of ſupporting, upon a proper occaſion, the efforts of the malecontents<note n="S" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, MSS.</note>, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged greatly the ſeceſſion of the diſſenting members; who certainly covered their affection for the excluded family, under the ſpecious pretext of adhering to the laws of their country.</p>

His political de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency was, at the ſame time, brought to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, by the two great parties which divided the nation.

The Queen's meſſage was received, at firſt, with aſtoniſhment and ſilence. A violent debate, at length, aroſe. Much was ſaid of the merit of Marlborough.

The Tories, who now formed a great majority, contrived to convey a reflection on the late King, in their refuſal of a ſettlement on Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough. They complained that the revenue of the crown had been already too much reduced, by the exorbitant grants of the laſt reign, to bear any further alienation. The adherents of the excluded branch of the family of Stuart, ſeemed to be moſt inclined to involve Marlborough in the cenſure paſſed upon King William. Though he was known to have uniformly oppoſed the power of that Prince, he was not deemed ſincere in his profeſſions and promiſes to his rival. His zeal, it is certain, had greatly abated, ſince the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Anne to the throne. He, however, kept upon fair terms with the court of St. Germains.

The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the court, joined to the zeal of the Whigs, had prevented any attempt to repeal this act, as long as William ſat upon the throne. But the party who favoured the church, finding themſelves ſo powerful in the houſe of commons, under a Queen who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to their principles, paſſed an order, on the fourth of November, for bringing in a bill to prevent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conformity. The bill was accordingly prepared and introduced, by Mr. Bromley and Mr. St. John, the latter afterwards well known, under the title of Bolingbroke. On the ninth of December, the bill was, a third time, read, paſſed, and ſent to the lords. Though the latter rejected not the bill, they made ſeveral amendments, to which the commons would not yield. A conference between the two houſes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject, produced nothing but a more firm ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, on both ſides, to their reſpective opinions. The commons ordered, at length<note n="W" place="bottom">Feb. 5.</note>, their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon this whole affair to be printed. Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was followed by the lords, and the bill was dropt.</p>

Sackville, who had, during the late reign, carried on the correſpondence between Marlborough and the court of St. Germains, and who had always free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Duke, propoſed a marriage between his third daughter and the pretended Prince of Wales. How Marlborough received the propoſal is uncertain. But the negociation ſeems not to have ended with the preſent year. The adherents of the family of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover, either appriſed of this projected connexion, or willing to gain to their own party the great influence and weight of Marlborough, formed a ſcheme on their ſide, to marry this daughter to the electoral Prince<note n="I" place="bottom">George II.</note>. The high-flying Tories, and eſpecially the Jacobite part of the miniſtry, were ſo much alarmed at this circumſtance, that they even intended to ſolicit the Queen herſelf to propoſe the match between her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Duke's daughter<note n="K" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1704.</note>.

The Duke, though a man of abilities, and agreeable in his manners, was profligate in his private life, and regarded chiefly his own intereſt in his public conduct. Though he came over with the Prince of Orange at the Revolution, and affected to be a mortal enemy to the family of Stuart, he had liſtened to the propoſals of King James, through the Earl of Arran, in the year 1691, when that Prince had a near proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of being reſtored to his throne.

The whole nation were inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted ſpectators of a conteſt, which they were taught to believe, was to determine their independence as a free people, or to ſubject them for ever to thoſe foreign councils, to which they had, with ſome reaſon, aſcribed the late misfortunes of the kingdom. The eagerneſs of the populace was transfuſed into parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

A general rage tranſported the houſe into a degree of fury. The commiſſioner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came apprehenſive of the ſafety of his own perſon.

The Engliſh legiſlature had ſettled the ſucceſſion of the crown on the houſe of Hannover. King William, either careleſs of the intereſts of that family, or, what is more probable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different concerning the fate of the crown, after his own death, had neglected to recommend to a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom a long habit had rendered ſubſervient to his views, the ſettlement of the crown of Scotland, in the proteſtant line. This circumſtance actually left the fate of England in the diſpoſal of the Scotiſh nation. Should the latter declare for the eventual ſucceſſion of the Prince of Wales, a title then not il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal in Scotland, there can ſcarce any doubt be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but conſidering the party which ſtill adhered to the exiled family in England, he would have, with great facility, recovered the crown of that kingdom. Some men of abilities in the Scotiſh parliament, who were by no means attached to the hereditary line, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this advantage; and they ſeized it with an eagerneſs, proportionable to their zeal for their country.</p>

The allies, conſiſting of Engliſh, Dutch, and Germans, were commanded by the Prince of Heſſe, the ſame who mounted, afterwards, the throne of Sweden.

                  <note place="margin">Campaign in general favourable for France.</note> The campaign of the year 1703 was, upon the whole, favourable to the houſe of Bourbon. The progreſs of the Elector of Bavaria, in the heart of Germany, had reduced the family of Auſtria into great ſtraits; while, at the ſame time, an inſurrection in Hungary diſtracted their councils, and ſpread de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation to the gates of Vienna.

Though the French had loſt ſome towns in Flanders, the progreſs made by the allies was inconſiderable. They failed in their attempts on the ſtrong lines formed by the enemy for the protection of Flanders; and in the only action of conſequence which happened on that ſide, they had loſt ſome trophies as well as the field. Though the bigotry of Lewis the Fourteenth had kndled the flames of war in the heart of his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, by forcing, by ſeverities, the Proteſtants in the Cevennes into an inſurrection, no effectual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage was taken of a circumſtance, which the allies might have greatly improved in their own favour.</p>

In a running battle, which was renewed, at intervals, for ſeveral days, the admiral was repeatedly deſerted by his captains, his ſhip diſabled, and his own leg ſhot away. The enemy, though much inferior in number and ſtrength, made, by theſe means, a ſafe retreat. Bembow, after this diſgraceful, as well as unfortunate action, returned to Jamaica. On the ſixth of October, he iſſued a commiſſion for the trial of captain Kirby and captain Wade.

The Queen herſelf, notwithſtanding her predilection for the church of England, was cold with regard to a bill, that ſeemed ſo highly favourable to the eſtabliſhed religion. She had been terrified with reports, that the Jacobites connected their views in favour of her brother, with the ſucceſs of this bill; and there certainly exiſted ſome reaſon for this apprehenſion. The miniſtry, during the dependence of the bill, were left to their own opinions.

Retiring to the Highlands, he lived for ſome time with his father at Beaufort, a farm which they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, for a ſubſiſtence, from the Lord Lovat. That nobleman, dying in the year 1696, left four daughters. Thomas Fraſer of Beaufort and his ſon Simon, collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome diſorderly perſons, attempted to ſeize the eſtate, as neareſt male heirs. Terrified, however, by a proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at law, they formally renounced their claims. But, in the month of September 1697, Simon Fraſer entered, with an armed force, the houſe of the widow of the Lord Lovat, ſeized her perſon, ordered the marriage cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be pronounced, in the midſt of the ſound of a bagpipe, with which he endeavoured to drown the lady's cries, and having ſtript her naked, by cutting off her ſtays with his dagger, forced her to bed and conſummat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pretended marriage, amidſt the noiſe and riot of his deſperate attendants<note n="Z" place="bottom">Trial of Fraſer.

But either diſtruſting his incredible promiſes, with regard to an inſurrection in Scotland, or unwilling to hazard either his men or money, without further ſecurity, he made him a preſent of five hundred Louis d'Ors, and deſired him to return to his own country, to bring credentials from thoſe perſons over whom he pretended to have ſo much power.

With the paſs, he tranſported himſelf ſafely to Holland, and from thence found means to convey himſelf again to Paris.

The latter having, in the beginning of the year, viſited Holland, and concerted the operations of the campaign with the States, had returned to England before the prorogation of parliament. To carry into execution the plan which he had formed and weighed, he embarked at Harwich, on the nineteenth of April. The ſucceſs of the two laſt campaigns, having rendered the allies maſters of the Maeſe and Spaniſh Guelderland, ſuch a ſtrong barrier had been formed on the ſide of Flanders, that a ſmall number of forces were deemed ſufficient to protect the frontiers of the States, againſt the efforts of the enemy. Marlborough having found means to convince the Dutch of their ſecurity, in that quarter, propoſed to march into the heart of Germany, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Emperor, now almoſt threatened with the ſiege of his capital, by the joint force of the French and Bavarians.</p>

Prince Eugene having haſtened to Philipſburg, to take upon himſelf the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the army on the Upper-Rhine, the duke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced toward the Danube, and joined the Imperialiſts, at Weſterſtetten; and having arrived on the river Brentz, on the twenty-eighth of June, he placed his camp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two leagues of the Elector of Bavaria's army. The troops of the allies conſiſted of ninety-ſix battalions of foot, and two hundred and two ſquadrons of horſe and dragoons, provided with forty-four pieces of field can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, four howitzers, and twenty-four pontons.

of five thouſand men, on each ſide. This action happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſecond of July; and, the next day, Donawert was deſerted by the Bavarians; and thus, the allies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their victory a bridge over the river, while they ſeparated from one another the troops of the enemy ſtationed on the Upper and Lower Danube.

To avoid a battle, with regard to the Elector of Bavaria and the French, was ultimately to force the allies to retire back to the Maine. But the Elector having been reinforced with a freſh army under the command of the Mareſchal de Tallard, reſolved, after a ſhort negociation into which he had entered to amuſe the allies, to abandon his own fate and that of his country, to the event of a battle. The oppoſing armies, after the junction of Tallard with the Bavarians, were equal in number, conſiſting each of eighty thouſand combatants<note n="L" place="bottom">Mem. du Marq.

                  <note place="margin">Battle of Blenheim, Auguſt 13.</note> The French and Bavarians lay encamped with the Danube on their right. The village of Blenheim, on the bank of that river, ſtood a little advanced in the front of the right wing of their line. Their left was covered with an extenſive thick wood, from which ran a rivulet along their front, into the Danube. This rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, as it paſſed through the plain, formed an almoſt continued moraſs, which would have been very difficult to paſs, had not the French and Bavarians, by a negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence fatal to themſelves, formed their line at a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſtance behind. When the Elector and the mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals perceived that the enemy, who were encamped with their left to the Danube and their right extending to the wood, were reſolved to give them battle, they threw twenty-eight battalions and eight ſquadrons of dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, into the village of Blenheim.

After ſeveral charges, with various ſucceſs, the courage of the French horſe began, at length, to abate. They retired behind the fire of ten bartalions, that had advanced while the cavalry were engaged. Theſe ſuſtained the charge, for a conſiderable time, againſt the Engliſh foot. But the duke, in the mean time, having charged home with his horſe the French cavalry, already wavering, drove them in their flight, into the Danube, and moſt of thoſe who had eſcaped the ſword, were drowned in that river.

But when they perceived that Tallard was defeated, they threw themſelves into three columns, and quitted the field with great dexterity and expedition. Had they now fallen on the flank of Marlborough, whoſe troops were employed in pillaging the camp of Tallard, the victory might have been recovered; or, at leaſt, the troops ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the two villages, might have been ſaved.

The Queen appointed a day of thankſgiving for this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantage; and with a pomp, not unſuitable to the pardonable vanity of her ſex, went in proceſſion to St. Paul's<note n="Y" place="bottom">Sept. 7.</note>.

of his expedition, his political importance was known to depend. The party excluded from office had, in a manner, openly declared, that they would attack him in parliament; and, it muſt be confeſſed, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great actions, he was not free from faults which his enemies might have ſeized with advantage. The torrent of his glory, however, came with ſuch rapidity and ſtrength on their deſigns, that they were levelled, and in a moment ruined. While foreign princes vied with one another to honour him abroad, he became, at home, the darling of a people fond of military fame.</p>

Their object, therefore, was to gain the Duke to the Proteſtant ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by a marriage between his daughter and the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral Prince. But this, with other ſchemes of the like kind, were dropt as difficult and uncertain<note n="Z" place="bottom">Sir Rowland Gwynne's letters.</note>.

The Duke, though, perhaps, not ſo ſincere in his profeſſions as the treaſurer, was leſs guarded in his conduct. In the month of April, when he was preparing to break the power of the French in Germany, he regretted the abſence of his nephew, the Duke of Berwick, in Portugal; as he ought to be nearer Britain, to take advantage of ſuch events as might ariſe in favour of the exiled Prince. He gave, at the ſame time, the moſt ſolemn aſſurances of his unalterable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and attachment to the excluded family; and directed their agents to apply to the Lord Godolphin, upon any emergency that might ariſe during his own abſence in the campaign<note n="B" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, April 22, 1704.</note>.</p>

The Queen, in compliance with her promiſe to the houſe of peers, made no ſecret of her deſign to propoſe to the parliament of Scotland, the ſettlement of the crown of that kingdom on the houſe of Hannover. To pave the way for this important buſineſs, ſome changes were made in the adminiſtration. The Duke of Queenſberry, who had rendered himſelf obnoxious, by his patronage of Frarer and the plot, was diſmiſſed, to ſoften the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar party, from his place of ſecretary of ſtate; and the Marqurs of Tweedale, a man of more honeſty than abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, ſucceeded him in the office of lord-high-commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner to the parliament.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the oppoſition had reſolved, that till the act of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity ſhould receive the royal aſſent, no ſupply ſhould be granted.

for the firſt time, on the twenty-fifth of July; and, on the fifth of Auguſt, it was touched with the ſcepter. Though the Duke of Hamilton was in cloſe correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the court of St. Germains, ſome of the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the excluded family had formed a ſuſpicion of his having views of his own on the crown.

A proviſion was made, that the ſucceſſor ſhould be a Proteſtant, and of the royal line of Scotland; but that the perſon appointed ſhould not be, at the ſame time, ſucceſſor to the crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

In a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from the ſubject of his ſpeech, his Lordſhip gave a full account of the proceedings in the Engliſh houſe of peers concerning that ſuppoſed conſpiracy.

The purport of this overture was, that the Engliſh houſe of lords, by their examination of the plot, and by addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Queen, in relation to a ſucceſſor to the crown of Scotland, had unduely interfered with the concerns of Scotlmen, and had encroached upon the honour, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and independency of the nation.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note> The refractory diſpoſition of the parliament of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land alarmed the favourers of the proteſtant ſucceſſion in England. Though the miniſter, the Lord Godolphin, was by no means of that number, the natural timidity of his diſpoſition rendered him, in ſome meaſure, averſe from a conduct which he ſecretly approved. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that things could not long remain in their preſent unſettled condition; and to prevent a criſis of affairs, which he had not courage to encounter, he deſerted his principles. There is no reaſon to believe that he private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encouraged the malecontents in Scotland, to reject the propoſal for ſettling the crown in the houſe of Hannover. But he had not yet opened that ſcene of corruption, which, afterwards, quieted the turbulence of the Scots; and which was, perhaps, neceſſary for the peace and ſafety of the two kingdoms. The Duke of Hamilton, who knew the principles of Godolphin, expreſſed his own fears of his want of courage<note n="H" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1704.</note>. He ſuppoſed, before the parliament of Scotland met, that many of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were to be gained with money, by the lord-treaſurer of England; and to meet him, in the line of corruption, he demanded a large ſum<note n="I" place="bottom">25,000l.</note> from France, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of purchaſing votes<note n="J" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1704.</note>.</p>

He ſent a meſſage to the court of St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, recommending that a force ſhould be held ready on the coaſt for an emergency. He aſſured the exiled family, that their party in Scotland, in conjunction with thoſe who adhered to the independence of their country, were reſolved, rather than ſubmit to the ſucceſſion of the houſe of Hannover, to throw every thing into confuſion, and leave the deciſion of the conteſt to the ſword. He gave it, as his opinion, that five thouſand men would be

ſufficient to re-eſtabliſh the excluded line on the throne of Scotland; and eventually to raiſe them to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of England. But before any deſcent ſhould be attempted, he deſired to be informed concerning the views and promiſes of the adherents of the excluded Prince in the latter kingdom; as the force neceſſary for a ſucceſsful invaſion, ought to be greater or ſmaller in proportion to the quality and number of his Engliſh friends. The Marquis of Montroſe, the Earls of Errol, Marſhal, Breadalbin, and Panmure, the Viſcount Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, the Lord Balmarino, the deprived biſhops, and many of the chiefs of the highland clans, expreſſed the ſame inclinations, and adhered to the ſame ſentiments, with the Duke of Hamilton<note n="K" place="bottom">Stuart papers, 1704.</note>.</p>

The miniſters of the excluded Prince were, however, either incapable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to obtain, from the court of France, an arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the invaſion of Scotland; and they made, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, their application for a deſcent in England. On the twenty-ſecond of June, a memorial for that purpoſe was preſented to the Marquiſſes de Torcy and de Chamillart. They ſignified to thoſe miniſters, that an attempt on England would be leſs impracticable and more deciſive, than to carry the war into Scotland, though the majority in that kingdom were in the intereſt of the exiled family.

To trim between the two great parties, who divided between them the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he had placed moderate Whigs in places poſſeſſed by violent Tories. He had the misfortune to loſe the latter, and not to gain the former. The poſſeſſion of power, under the ſpecious name of a difference in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, had long been the motive of conteſt between theſe factions; and their mutual animoſities had aſcended to a height that diſdained a divided authority in the kingdom. The trimming Whigs, admitted by Godolphin into office, had promiſed to manage both parties, by playing their prejudices againſt one another. This conduct, to make it ſucceed, required the utmoſt dexterity and addreſs. Though the parties were ſo poized, that the weight of government could give to either ſide, at pleaſure, the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, their conteſts, eſpecially, in their preſent inflamed ſtate, were certain of embarraſſing, if not capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely obſtructing the public buſineſs.</p>

The bill againſt occaſional conformity, which had been twice loſt before, in the houſe of lords, was again introduced by the church party, into the houſe of commons<note n="T" place="bottom">Nov. 23.</note>. To embarraſs the miniſtry, and to diſtreſs the Whigs, who abetted the diſſenters, a motion was made for tacking the bill to the land-tax bill. The houſe of lords having no power to alter any money-bill, but either to paſs it entire or reject the whole, that aſſembly would either have been obliged to agree to the bill, or to put an end to the war, which depended on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.

When the act of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, which had been paſſed in Scotland in the preceding ſummer, came to be debated in the parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Whigs and Tories complained againſt it with equal warmth.

The Tories, in their arguments in the houſe of commons, urged that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the act of ſecurity tended to defeat the ſucceſſion in the houſe of Hannover. But when this propoſition was reduced into a motion, it was rejected by the Whigs, though they had profeſſed themſelves the only friends of the deſcent of the crown in the proteſtant line. The two parties, however, agreed that ſome vigorous efforts muſt be taken in England, to obviate the dangers ariſing from the proceedings in Scotland. The violent, on both ſides, were, however, well-pleaſed at bottom with meaſures which ſeemed equally calculated to promote their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive views.

The Duke of Marlborough arrived in Holland in the beginning of April; and having concerted the operations of the campaign with the States, took the field in the firſt week in May. His great object was to improve the victories of the preceding campaign, by carrying the war by the Moſelle into the heart of France. With the ſame number of troops as in the laſt year, he marched through the country of Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg; and being joined near Treves by the Prince of Heſſe, he croſſed the Moſelle and the Saar, marched to the defile of Taveren, and advanced to Elſt. The French apprized of the deſigns of Marlborough, had aſſembled an army of ſeventy thouſand men on that ſide, under the command of the Mareſchal de Villars, who occupying a ſtrong camp at Sirk, reſolved to remain on the defenſive.

The prince of Baden, who commanded the Imperialiſts, either from a perſonal diſlike to Marlborough, or unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with the means of taking the field, diſappointed him in his promiſe of joining the allies with the German troops; and thus the Duke remained inactive in his camp, for the ſpace of a month, in daily hopes of a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that never arrived<note n="P" place="bottom">Hiſt. d'Allemagne, tom. vii.</note>.</p>

That Prince born with a degree of virtue, was deſtitute of talents.

His ſon, who had been, ſeveral years before, created King of the Romans, ſucceeded him in the Imperial dignity. That Prince inherited his father's miniſters as well as his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and the ſame counſels continued to act under the name of Joſeph, that had uniformly prevailed in the reign of Leopold. The ſucceſſion to the Spaniſh throne, the increaſe of the Imperial power, on the ruins of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the German princes, and the reduction of the inſurgents in Hungary, were the principal objects of the preſent as well as of the late Emperor. But Joſeph was better calculated than his father to ſucceed in theſe views. His mind was active and full of fire, his diſpoſition vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his character enterpriſing; and to an induſtry, which ran violently from one ſcheme to another, he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a firmneſs of ſoul, that diſdained to yield either to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or misfortune.</p>

This inability in the court of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna, combining with the envious and obſtinate diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prince of Baden, forced Marlborough to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his deſigns of carrying the war into France, by the courſe of the Moſelle.

The Duke of Hamilton moved a clauſe importing, that the propoſed union, <q rend="inline">"ſhould no ways derogate from any fundamental laws, ancient privileges, offices, rights, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and dignities of the Scotiſh nation."</q> This over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſo popular, that, but for the negligence of the duke's own party, ſeven or eight of whom happened to be abſent, it muſt have certainly been carried: and when it even came to the vote, it was loſt only by two voices. The other attempts made by the cavaliers to clog the act, were impotent and ill-ſupported. The act for treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with England was paſſed, without any conſiderable amendments; and the parliament having finiſhed this important buſineſs, and granted the demanded ſupplies, were adjourned, on the twenty-firſt of September.</p>

Queen addreſſed to the two houſes a ſpeech, penned by Cowper, the new lord-keeper, which, though ſuitable to the times, ſhewed that the meaſures of the court were no longer guided by Tory principles. She urged, with earneſtneſs, the neceſſity of proſecuting the war, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the balance of power, which, ſhe ſaid, the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Spain by the houſe of Bourbon, had deſtroyed. She demanded the neceſſary ſupplies, for ſupporting the operations of the allies, as well as for exerting the force of her own kingdoms. She informed them of the act paſſed in Scotland, for treating concerning an union; and ſhe concluded, with taking an obvious part with the Whigs, by declaring that the church was in no danger; a circumſtance urged with vehemence by the Tories, to arm the prejudices of the populace to favour their own deſigns.</p>

The ſupplies, for the next year, amounting, beſides the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary revenue appropriated to the civil liſt, and the payment of intereſt for debts, to more than five millions, were voted, with the ſame unanimity and ſeeming zeal<note n="N" place="bottom">Nov. 10.</note>. The war was not the topic upon which the contending parties reſolved to try their force. Public pretences were invariably uſed throughout this reign, by the leaders of the two parties, to cover their own private deſigns upon office and the poſſeſſion of power. The leaders of the Tories, on the one hand, expreſſed the utmoſt ſolicitude for the church of England. Thoſe of the Whigs diſcovered a wonderful zeal for the ſucceſſion of the Crown in the proteſtant line. They both aſſailed the weakneſs of their leſs intelligent followers, through theſe channels; and, arming themſelves with the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the populace, endeavoured alternately to take the cabinet by ſtorm. The Tories, having been deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the miniſtry, applied themſelves to the people.

To haraſs their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, to embarraſs their political enemies, perhaps to gain ſome popularity for themſelves, and, above all, to vent their reſentment againſt the miniſter, they had long before the meeting of parliament<note n="O" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1705.</note>, reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, either by bill or addreſs, to demand from the Queen, that the Princeſs Sophia ſhould be invited into the kingdom, as the next heir of the crown. A propoſal of the ſame kind, when urged by the Whigs, had been rejected by the Tories themſelves, when poſſeſſed of power. But neither the inconſiſtency of the meaſure, nor its contrariety to their own private opinions, could prevail with them to forego a motion, from which they hoped to derive leſs advantage to their own views, than a kind of malignant pleaſure in diſconcerting their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

A cry that the church was in danger, had been propagated with ſuch induſtry, without doors, that the Whigs reſolved to check the panic which had ſpread among the people, by a declaratory vote in parliament. The Lord Halifax, having moved for a day to examine into the pretended danger of the church, a debate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, more expreſſive of the violence of the parties, than ſuitable to the ſubject.

Though the laws had fixed the ſucceſſion on the houſe of Hannover, five years before, the ſuppoſed attachment of the Queen to her own family, the numerous party known to be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to the pretended Prince of Wales, the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the people againſt foreigners, and the memory of the inconvenience of connexions abroad in the laſt reign, had rendered the ſucceſs of the act of ſettlement extremely doubtful. During this ſtate of uncertainty, little court was paid by the ſubjects of England to the electoral family. Few viſited the court of Hannover; and thoſe who made their appearance there, either through zeal or weakneſs, like Gwyne, hurt the cauſe which they meant to ſerve<note n="Z" place="bottom">Hannover-papers.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, &amp;c. ſent to Hannover.</note> The Princeſs Sophia herſelf, either ſuſpecting the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of Queen Anne and her miniſters, or miſled by the repreſentations of the new Engliſh who reſorted to the court of Hannover, entertained little hopes that her family ſhould ever mount the throne. She even ſeems to have placed no value on the acts of regency and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization which paſſed in the preſent ſeſſion<note n="A" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. She probably ſoon after changed her ſentiments. On the fourth of April, her grandſon, the electoral prince, was made a knight-companion of the garter. The Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax, accompanied by Clarencieux king at arms, was ſent to Hannover to carry the enſigns of the order to the prince, and to preſent the act of naturalization to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The current began to run with vehemence in that channel. The lords who could claim any merit in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the acts in ſavour of the houſe of Hannover, made their court with letters full of expreſſions of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment and zeal. The Whigs adopted chiefly this mode of removing the unfavourable impreſſions made on the minds of the electoral family, by the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

                  <note place="margin">Obſervations</note> The ſtrife between the Whigs and Tories, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an appearance of zeal for the family of Hannover, proceeded more from the ſelfiſh views of their reſpective leaders, than from motives of public good. To ſecure the good opinion of the people, in countries poſſeſſed of liberty, is the ſhorteſt way of gaining, and the ſureſt means of retaining power. In the political farces too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exhibited by parties, the populace are the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and thoſe who ſuit their antick geſtures beſt to their prejudices, carry the moſt applauſe. Two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had long been predominant in the minds of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nation: a fixed averſion to France; and a zeal, which bordered on enthuſiaſm, for the proteſtant religion. The manly ſpirit which undeviatingly looks forward to public freedom, independent of common prejudices, fell only to the ſhare of a few. The pretence to that ſpirit, though a ſtale impoſture, ſeldom failed to impoſe on the world. The Whigs, when they affected to give the great ſecurity to the Proteſtant ſucceſſion, paid their court to the populace, in a manner inconſiſtent with the avowed principles of their party. They repealed, in the bill of regency, the limitations which the Tories had impoſed on the ſucceſſor in the act of ſettlement; and, with a frankneſs ſcarce conſiſtent with common prudence, boaſted openly, that they reſtored to the crown all its former prerogatives. The ſpirit of party, however, had been carried to ſuch a pitch, that every meaſure calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to annoy their adverſaries, was deemed, not only juſtifiable, but even laudable, by both ſides.</p>

His actions were even at variance with his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in his public conduct. In his private capacity, with an odd inconſiſtent ſpecies of ſincerity, he avoided to make profeſſions where he wiſhed not to be of ſervice.

with the family of Stuart, through their agents<note n="C" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1706.</note>. His fears of impeachment, however, prevailed over his affection for the excluded race. Though the Duke of Marlborough had promiſed<note n="D" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, in his name, to the agents of the court of St. Germains, that no money ſhould be given to gain votes for the union, in the parliament of Scotland, the terrors of Godolphin returned, and he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the treaſury to the avarice of the venal and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the needy. The ſecret ſpring which moved the great meaſures of his adminiſtration, lay in a defect of his mind; and, by a ſingular piece of good fortune, to his character, his country aſcribed to his diſtinguiſhed parts, a line of conduct which ſprung from his political cowardice.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Campaign of 1706.</note> During theſe important tranſactions at home, prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made abroad for opening, with vigour, the campaign, on every ſide. The Duke of Marlborough having left the Hague, on the ninth of May, joined, on the twentieth of the month, the united armies of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and the States, between Borchloen and Groſzwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. France, in an evil hour for herſelf, had reſolved to act offenſively in Flanders. The Mareſchal de Villeroi, iſſuing from the lines which he had formed behind the Deule, advanced to Tirlemont; and, without waiting for the arrival of the Elector of Bavaria, with whom he was joined in the command, puſhed forward precipitate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Ramillies. When his front had advanced to the heights where riſes the little Geette, he perceived the allies, on full march, appearing in ſight. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately formed his army in order of battle. The Geette and an impaſſable moraſs running along its banks, covered his left wing; and prevented it alike from being attacked itſelf and from charging the enemy. The village of Ramillies, ſituated in a plain near the ſource of the Geette, was advanced before his centre, which conſiſted entirely of infantry. The village of Tavieres, on the banks of the Mehaigne, covered his right wing; and an open and level ſpace, between Tavieres and Ramillies, about a mile and a half in length, was filled with one hundred ſquadrons of horſe. In this narrow aperture the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0709200302:334"/>
battle of Ramillies was fought, on the twenty-third of May.<note n="E" place="bottom">N. S. Mem. du. Marq. de Feuquiere.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Battle of</note> On a riſing ground, oppoſed to the left of the enemy, along the ſwampy ſide of the Geette, the Duke of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough formed his right. His line extended through the plain to the left, which was covered by the river Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haigne. Having, by a feigned attack, on the right of the French, which was, in fact, impracticable, deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mareſchal de Villeroi, he obtained his purpoſe of obliging the enemy to thin their left, which introduced a confuſion, while it weakened their line in the only place where they could be attempted with advantage. The Duke, in the mean time, ordered Auverquerque, with the Dutch infantry, to begin the battle on the left, while he himſelf, covering his motions with the riſing ground, fell at once on the centre of the enemy, with all the foot that formed his own. The French making a gallant reſiſtance, Marlborough ordered all his cavalry to make a home charge. But, in the hurry, he himſelf, being a bad horſeman, falling to the ground, was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being trampled to death by his own ſquadrons. Being remounted, he purſued his plan of attack, while, at the ſame time, the Daniſh horſe, under the Duke of Wirtemberg, fell on their flank, and completing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order which Marlborough had begun, the whole centre of the enemy, on which the ſtreſs of the battle lay, were routed and put to flight<note n="F" place="bottom">Mem. de Fequiere.</note>. The horſe having abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the foot with which they were interlined, the latter were cut to pieces.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ramillies.</note> The Elector of Bavaria and the Mareſchal de Villeroi, ſhewed more courage in endeavouring to retrieve the battle, than they ſhewed of conduct in forming their line. They made repeated, but vain, efforts to bring back the cavalry to the charge. The houſehold troops rallied, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the battle, and were again ſorced to fly. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the misfortunes of the French, the remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which happened at the village of Blenheim two years before, was a ſecond time exhibited, at that of Ramillies. Eight battalions, which De Villeroi had placed in that village in his front, maintained their poſt,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0709200302:335"/>
till they perceived their main body driven from the field. In endeavouring to retreat, toward their left, which had not been at all engaged, they were attacked by the caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the allies, before they could form themſelves in the field. Confuſion, ſlaughter, and flight prevailed. Many were cut to pieces, the reſt were diſperſed. The right wing, in the mean time, gave way before the Dutch, and directed their flight toward Charleroy. A complete victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remained to the allies. The remains of the enemy, having attempted, in vain, to ſtand behind the Deule, were forced to retreat from thence, and to take ſhelter under the cannon of Liſle<note n="G" place="bottom">Mem. de Feuquiere.

                  <note place="margin">Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that important action.</note> Though no victory could be more complete than that obtained at Ramillies, the action may rather be called a rout than a battle. The allies, through the wretched diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Villeroi, beat, in leſs than a quarter of an hour, an army of eighty thouſand men, who left no more than three thouſand dead in the field<note n="H" place="bottom">Mem. de Marq. de Feuquiere.</note>, took one hundred pieces of cannon, and a great quantity of baggage, together with all the various trophies of war<note n="I" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, tom. iii.</note>. The conſequences of this rout were as important in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they were ſtriking and extraordinary. The fugitives were not to be rallied, till they had carried themſelves, not only beyond the purſuit, but even the very report of the enemy. Their firſt ſtand was made about eighty miles from the field of battle. Nor durſt they even remain at Courtray, where firſt they formed the appearance of an army. Some were placed in the frontier garriſons of France. The boldeſt formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves into two inconſiderable flying armies, more calculated to amuſe, than to oppoſe a victorious enemy. The total conqueſt of Brabant, and almoſt all Spaniſh Flanders, was the immediate conſequence of the victory. Louvain, Bruſſels, Anſwerp, Mechlin, Aloſt, Ghent, and Oudenarde, ſurrendered without firing a gun; and the firſt ſtop was put to the progreſs of the allies, by Dendermonde and Oſtende. The latter, however, was forced to capitulate, after the trenches were open eight days. Menin ſurrendered, after an obſtinate reſiſtance;

The beginning of the campaign in Italy, was favourable for France and Spain. The Duke of Berwick took the caſtle of Nice, on the fourth of January. Vendôme, having defeated the Germans at Calcinato, on the nineteenth of April, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Turin itſelf to be inveſted, on the third of May. The trenches were opened by the French, on the night of the ſecond of June; and the fate of the war in Italy ſeemed to depend on the taking of that important place. The Duke of Savoy avoiding to ſhut himſelf up in his capital, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent his family to Genoa, retired with a few troops to the vallies of Lucerne, among his proteſtant ſubjects the Vaudois. The ſtrength of the town, the bravery of the garriſon, together with the languor, and even unſkilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the enemy, who were nominally under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Duke of Orleans, protracted the ſiege to the beginning of September, when a great event put an end, in Italy, to all the hopes and efforts of the houſe of Bourbon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Battle of Turin.</note> Prince Eugene, who commanded the German army, on the frontiers of the dominions of Venice, after a long and painful march, and having paſſed ſeveral rivers and many defiles, without being oppoſed, arrived in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Turin, in the firſt week of September, joined the Duke Savoy, and reſolved to attack the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

Though the enemy had made little impreſſion on the works, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſon began to be in great danger, through the want of ammunition. No time was, therefore, to be loſt. The Prince, having made his diſpoſitions for the attack, fell ſuddenly on the entrenchments of the enemy; and, after

an obſtinate conteſt, for two hours, entered their camp, drove them from the field, took all their cannon, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, heavy baggage, ammunition, and implements em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſiege. The Duke of Orleans himſelf was wounded. The Mareſchal de Marſin was killed. The fugitives, inſtead of retiring to Caſal, which would have maintained the Milaneſe, directed their retreat to Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol. In the ſpace of four hours, the Modeneſe, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan, the Milaneſe, Piedmont, and ultimately the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Naples, were loſt to the houſe of Bourbon. A complete victory obtained by the Count de Medavi, over a ſmall army of Imperialiſts, under the command of the Prince of Heſſe, two days after the battle before Turin, ſerved only to aggravate the misfortunes of that action<note n="K" place="bottom">German accounts.

Except the taking of Villareal, which was forced, on the eighth of January, by the Conde de Las-Torres, the whole of the campaign formed one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued train of diſgraces and loſſes. The Archduke Charles having, by the aid of the Engliſh, eſtabliſhed himſelf in the winter in Spain, Philip the Fifth, and the Mareſchal de Teſſe advanced, with twenty thouſand men, and ſhut him up at Barcelona, while the Comte de Toulouſe blocked up the place by ſea, with a French fleet. When a practicable breach was made, a fortunate accident preſerved the place, and, with it, the footing which the allies had eſtabliſhed in Spain. A ſuperior fleet appearing, under Sir John Leake, on the coaſt, the Comte de Toulouſe precipitately retired in the night. A reinforcement of troops was thrown into Barcelona. Philip and the Mareſchal de Teſſé raiſed the ſiege in the utmoſt confuſion. An almoſt total eclipſe of the ſun, which happened on the twelfth of May, and covered the country with a ſudden darkneſs, compleated the conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſuperſtitions Spaniards.

They entered Eſtramadura, they took Alcanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, they forced Cividad-Rodrigo, Salamanca, and the poſt of Eſpinar. They directed their march, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, without reſiſtance, to Madrid. Philip the Fifth, having abandoned his capital, removed the Queen and the court to Burgos. The Engliſh and the Portugueze entered the city in triumph; and to complete the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of the King of Spain, he received intelligence, that the count de Sancta-Cruz had delivered Carthagena and the gallies to the enemy. The unaccountable errors of the Engliſh and Portugueze prevented the Spaniſh crown from being for ever transferred from the houſe of Bourbon. They loitered in the midſt of diſeaſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery and ſloth, at Madrid, till they were rouſed by the approach of Philip, with a ſuperior force. Galway and Las-Minas were forced to retire from Madrid. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined the Archduke, they paſſed into the kingdom of Valencia; and diſpoſed their quarters in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to cover the kingdoms of Arragon and Catalonia, and maintain a free entrance into Caſtile. The Duke of Berwick hung cloſe on their retreat; and, before the end of the campaign, retook Carthagena.

In compliance with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence communicated by this adventurer, land forces, to the number of ten thouſand men, were ſent on board of tranſports, under the protection of the confederate fleets, commanded in chief by Sir Cloudſley Shovel. The Earl of Rivers, a man of a profligate character<note n="P" place="bottom">Swiſt's Notes of Macky, MS.</note>, and venal principles, but perſonally brave, was placed at the head of the forces deſtined for the expedition. But the plan was ſo indefinite and ill-projected, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wind, which drove back the fleet, and confined the ſhips of war and tranſports to the channel, till the ſeaſon for action was paſt, might be conſidered as a ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of good fortune. The avowed ſcheme of the Marquis de Guiſcard was to reſtore liberty to France but he behaved himſelf with ſuch tyranny and folly, in a command in which he had been placed by the indulgence of the Engliſh government, that he was recalled from the fleet, at the ſpecial requeſt of the admiral.</p>

Mankind turned their attention to that monarch, in a degree equal to their hopes from his ſpirit, or their fears from his power. France courted his friendſhip, with a vehemence propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the diſtreſſed condition of her affairs. The emperor dreaded that the preſence of Charles in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny might kindle diſturbances, which, by employing the force of the empire at home, might diſappoint the views of his own family on the Spaniſh throne. The diet of Ratiſbon ſhewed a diſpoſition of declaring the King of Sweden an enemy ſo the empire. But the Emperor himſelf found means to ſoften any reſentment that might ariſe in the breaſt of that enterpriſing Prince, by flattering his pride. Beſides, the mind of Charles was too much engaged with the deſign of reducing the Czar of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy into the ſame abject condition with the Elector of Saxony, to permit him to entertain thoughts of any other kind. He, therefore, liſtened, without being moved, to the inſtances of France; and yielded to the deſire of the Emperor, without any attachment to his cauſe<note n="S" place="bottom">Hiſtoria Polona, p. 32.</note>.</p>

of both nations to meet, and treat concerning an Union of the two kingdoms. They met accordingly, for the firſt time, at the Cockpit, on the ſixteenth of April; and, having continued their ſittings, at intervals, to the twenty-third of July, they preſented the articles upon which they had agreed, to her Majeſty. The moſt material of theſe were the following: That the two kingdoms ſhould be united into one, by the name of Great Britain. That the ſucceſſion of the united king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould remain to the Princeſs Sophia and the heirs of her body, being proteſtants. That the whole people of Britain ſhould be repreſented by one parliament, in which ſixteen peers and forty-five commoners choſen for Scotland, ſhould ſit and vote.

In the two preceding years, the Jacobites had made frequent propoſals to the French King, to which he paid little attention, as long as the misfortunes of the war had left him the power of giving effectual aid.

They were ſtrangers neither to the venality of the members, nor to the effectual meaſures taken by the court of England to gain a majority, through the channels of ambition and avarice. The repeated promiſes of the Duke of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough<note n="W" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1705, 1706.</note>, to the court of St. Germains, that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould be ſent to Scotland, were little regarded by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphin.

A great majority being thus procured, the parliament, to which Queenſberry was appointed commiſſioner, was ſuffered to meet, on the third of October. The treaty of Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read, was ordered to be printed, and the houſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed for ſeven days. The people, who had been hitherto ſoothed with favourable reports of the articles, became outrageous, finding themſelves, as they thought, deceived.

On every vote, a majority of more than two to one appeared for the Union. The peers, who gained the leaſt by the treaty, were the moſt eager for its being approved. Many of that order, in particular the Earl of Roxburgh, ſacrificed their former zeal againſt an union, to promiſes of being advanced to higher honours. Others yielded to their neceſſities, or liſtened to their avarice. Some, who perceived the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Jacobites, abetted, through principle, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which was likely to put an end to the romantic ſchemes of that reſtleſs party. A few, tired of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning factions which had ſo long diſtracted the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, favoured the Union from a view of repoſe. All ſeemed to be flattered with the hopes of extending, in time, over Great Britain, thoſe privileges and honours which were now confined to a narrow corner of the iſland. Theſe motives combining with that ſubſerviency to the views of the reigning prince, which peers derive from the crown with their patents, threw the weight of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Scotland on the ſide of a treaty, that ſeemed calculated to render their order inſignificant, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>

Though no deciſive vote was yet propoſed, the people perceived from the complexion of the houſe, that the whole would be approved by the parliament. During the debates the mob roſe at Edinburgh, and committed every ſpecies of outrage and extravagance. The members who favoured the Union, the ſervants of government, and the commiſſioner himſelf, were menaced and inſulted. Thoſe who oppoſed the treaty were received with the acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the populace every where, and denominated the friends, patrons, and even ſaviours of their native land. But when, in the beginning of November, the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeded to approve of the articles, addreſſes againſt the Union were poured in from every ſide. The populace, rouſed to a degree of fury, throughout the

In Glaſgow, in particular, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants took arms, drove their magiſtrates out of the city, inſulted ſuch as favoured the Union, and hung, in effigy, the commiſſioners who had agreed to that treaty. The uncommon rigour of the ſeaſon could only ſave the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from the vengeance of the people; who, had they not been prevented by the inclemency of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were determined to pour from every quarter to Edinburgh, to tear to pieces the obnoxious part of their repreſentatives<note n="Z" place="bottom">Mem. of Scotland.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Arguments</note> To theſe declamatory apoſtrophes, the Duke and other members added arguments of a more ſolid kind<note n="A" place="bottom">Mem. of Scotland.</note>. They averred, that all the advantages from a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government with England, and the repoſe that might be expected from an union with a powerful king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, were but mean conſiderations for the ſpirit which the people muſt loſe with their independence as a nation. They argued, that though individuals might profit by the change, the country in general muſt ſuffer decay from the removal of the ſeat of government, which, like the heart in the human frame, threw life and vigour from the center to the extremities of the kingdom. They affirmed, that inſtead of bringing a part of the commerce of England into Scotland, the Union would ruin that of the latter kingdom, by carrying away from their native country, to which they would probably never return, the moſt enterpriſing and the moſt induſtrious of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. They ſaid, that impoſts already laid on the trade of England, would more than counter-balance the preſent diſadvantages of that of the Scots, whoſe imports and exports were leſs burdened; and they affirmed, that though ſome change for the better might happen, with regard to commerce in ſome particular places, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ought rather to be aſcribed to an increaſe of induſtry in a few individuals, than to the general proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the country.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">againſt the Union.</note> They deſcended from theſe more obvious arguments, to ſpeculative obſervations. They affirmed, that Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as an independent kingdom, ought to have met England on equal ground. They ſaid, that an Union which deprived any ſubject of the rights which he already poſſeſſed, looked more like terms obtained from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of conquerors, than a treaty voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between free nations for mutual advantage. They averred, that the Scottiſh peers, by relinquiſhing the right of their order to ſit and vote in parliament, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the honour of their country, and actually altered its conſtitution; and that the ſmall number of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the people, had effectually thrown the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0709200302:348"/>
nation under the dominion of ſtrangers, while it deprived many individuals of the honour and advantage of having a ſhare in framing laws by which they were to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They derived an argument againſt the Union, from the dangers in which it might involve even the freedom of England, and conſequently that of Scotland, as united with that kingdom, in its misfortunes, rather than in its advantages. The repreſentatives of the Scots, they ſaid, would inevitably become a poor and deſpicable race, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the purſe, and conſequently on the will of the Crown; and having ſhewn ſo little concern for the ſupport of their own conſtitution, it was not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they would pay any regard to that of another nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The articles approved.</note> On the other ſide it was urged with vehemence, that the Union, in the preſent ſtate of affairs, was neceſſary, and that no better terms could be obtained from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nation. To this the Duke of Hamilton fiercely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; that <q rend="inline">"he thought the Scots, being on the ſame continent with the Engliſh, might furniſh their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners with a very deciſive argument on that ſubject."</q> A profound ſilence followed theſe words<note n="B" place="bottom">Oct. 29.</note>. None of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to make any reply to an obſervation which was, in fact, unanſwerable. Though Scotland had been long torn to pieces with violent factions and obſtinate parties, the Union had become much more neceſſary for England than for that kingdom. Had, therefore, the parliament of Scotland regarded their own future intereſt more than a trival advantage at preſent, there is ſcarce any doubt but they could have commanded terms more conſonant to the independence which they claimed in the name of their country. But though the Jacobites aſcribed the paſſing of the act of Union to the venality of the members, they might with equal juſtice accuſe their own want of ſpirit and folly. The Duke of Hamilton himſelf, who ſhewed ſo much vehemence in ſpeaking, yielded, when matters demanded action, to a happy timidity, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive, with regard to the Union, than all the purchaſed votes of his opponents<note n="C" place="bottom">Mem. of Scot.

The lower ſort of people throughout the kingdom were inflamed to a degree of madneſs, at the thoughts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjected, as they conſtrued the conſequences of the Union, to the government and tyranny of the Engliſh nation. The act of ſecurity, by placing arms in their hands two years before, had rendered them fit for war.

The Preſbyterians of the Weſt, who had ſuffered much under the government of the houſe of Stuart, were now the moſt violent to forward their cauſe, by defeating the Union, and conſequently the ſucceſſion in the family of Hannover. They ſent to inform the Duke of Hamilton, that they were preparing to march to Edinburgh to diſperſe, to uſe their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, a wretched parliament, who by ſuffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be purchaſed to the betraying of the honour, proſperity, and independence of their country, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their right to determine for their conſtituents, and had become an aſſembly of lawleſs and abandoned rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers<note n="F" place="bottom">Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Laird of Kerſland, MS.</note>.

                  <note place="margin">They are prevented by the Duke of Hamilton.</note> This myſterious conduct of Hamilton requires to be explained. He was in his principles a violent Jacobite, from the Revolution to the end of the ſecond year of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0709200302:350"/>
Queen Anne. His undeviating adherence to the intereſt of James the Second, his induſtry and negociations in that Prince's favour in England, till the affair of Darien had rendered Scotland a more promiſing field for intrigue, had gained to the Duke an unbounded confidence from the court of St. Germains. He conducted himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their inſtructions, and THEY paid the utmoſt deference to his advice. When the country-party, in conjunction with the Jacobites, had carried repeated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions in parliament, that the ſucceſſor to the crown of England ſhould NOT mount the throne of Scotland, a gleam of royalty ſeems to have opened on the Duke of Hamilton's mind. This cooled his zeal for the family of Stuart and diſconcerted his own meaſures, by being an object too great and too difficult for his limited capacity. Though after the poſterity of James the Firſt of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Duke was the next Proteſtant heir to the crown of Scotland, he was, by no means, qualified to gratify his ambition. His eſtate was not great, and he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with debt. He had few vaſſals and ſcarce any followers, except ſuch as looked up to him as the head placed over them by the court of St. Germains. When he heſitated to join in their violent ſchemes againſt the Union, he loſt their confidence. His moſt intimate friends deſerted a man, who was believed to have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his party. He was openly accuſed of treachery and venality; and the reflections of others, combining, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, with his own regret, for having abandoned what fortune had placed in his hands, threw him into a violent illneſs, which threatened his diſſolution<note n="I" place="bottom">Lockhart's Mem.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections</note> Though the terms of the Union were by no means calculated to flatter the pride of the Scots, as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent people, no expedient could be deemed unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that put an end to their own government, as it then ſtood. There were radical defects in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kingdom, which in the beſt times and in the ableſt hands, could not fail to be productive of perpetual evils to the nation. The eſtates of parliament, by meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one houſe and voting promiſcuouſly, in all debates, created a confuſion and promoted a jarring of intereſts,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0709200302:351"/>
more likely to embarraſs than to tranſact the buſineſs of the public, with regularity and preciſion. The number of the peers, the poverty of that order, and their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent dependence on the crown, by carrying every vote in parliament, left the body of the people, in a manner, without a repreſentative. The weight, which the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of England threw into the ſcale of the ſovereign, had improved his authority, before the Revolution, into an almoſt uncontroulable tyranny. The crown was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, though government was permitted to retain its ancient form. The blow, which the royal prerogative received in Scotland, in the memorable year 1688, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed licentiouſneſs rather than freedom, in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The parliament were placed in a ſituation to make the moſt for themſelves, at the hands of the King, while the people felt nothing from the alteration in government, but a change of tyrants.</p>

The freedom of debate, which was introduced by the Revolution into parliament, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed many with the means of diſcovering their own parts; and animated them with an eagerneſs, which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind miſtook for public ſpirit. In an evil hour, for the nation, they were divided into many and irreconcilable factions; a circumſtance hurtful in any country, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ruinous, where the field of conteſt is too ſmall. While they watched the motions of one another, the golden opportunity of mending their own conſtitution at home, or of incorporating themſelves, upon honourable and advantageous terms, with England, was for ever loſt. The peculiar ſituation of the latter kingdom had placed the fate of her monarchy, in ſome meaſure, in the hands of the Scots; and the latter could ſcarce be called unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, ſhould they inſiſt upon meeting their more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful neighbours upon a footing of greater equality. But in the animoſity of parties, all regard for the public was loſt; and a kind of mean ſelfiſhneſs, which ſcarce deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be dignified with the name of avarice, took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of every breaſt, and marked the age with indelible infamy.</p>

Having privately made ſome ineffectual applications of this kind to the States of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, he reſolved publickly to ſignify his earneſt deſire of peace; and he, for that purpoſe, ordered the Elector of Bavaria to write letters to the Duke of Marlborough and the field-deputies of the States, to propoſe the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a general congreſs<note n="K" place="bottom">Oct. 21.</note>. As a proof of his ſincerity, he mentioned at once the terms.

The Duke of Marlborough was fond of the emoluments as well as of the glory of war. Prince Eugene, beſides being actuated by ſimilar motives, carried an irreconcilable averſion to France, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his views; and the penſionary Heinſius, who had the addreſs to lead the counſels of the States, in acting in ſubſerviency to the two generals, yielded to his own intereſt. Theſe three diſtinguiſhed perſons, were the great ſprings that now moved the grand alliance.

The King of Portugal and the Duke of Savoy were ſo little conſidered, that they were not conſulted; and, from all theſe various cauſes, Europe was deſtined to remain, for ſeveral years more, a ſcene of carnage, diſtreſs, and confuſion. The Whigs, who were now poſſeſſed of the whole power of government in England, inſulted common ſenſe, in the reaſon which they gave for rejecting the propoſed peace.

The parliament having met at Weſtminſter, on the third of December, the commons proceeded, with ſuch unanimity, to grant the ſupplies, that an ample proviſion was made, in the ſpace of eighteen days, for the ſervice of the ſucceeding year. Though the excluded party had neither forgotten their own misfortunes nor forgiven thoſe in office, the ſplendour of victories abroad, and the reputation of their meaſures at home, had placed the miniſtry beyond the power of any ſucceſsful attack. The church-party, therefore, prudently fell down with a ſtream which they could no longer oppoſe. The two houſes, in congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Queen on the ſucceſſes of the war, neglected not the Duke of Marlborough. They thanked him for his important ſervices. As a more ſolid, and to the Duke a no leſs grateful mark of their eſteem, they paſſed a bill to perpetuate his titles to his poſterity, in the female as well as in the male line; and they continued to his family, for ever, the five thouſand pounds a year, which the Queen had granted during her own life<note n="N" place="bottom">Journals of both houſes.</note>.</p>

This ſum, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ill applied, was intended for the recoinage of the money of Scotland, to diſcharge the public debt, and to repay to the African company all their loſſes with intereſt. As the misfortunes of that wretched body of adventurers, were the ſource of the diſturbances which ſubſiſted among the Scots, for the laſt ten years, ſo the proſpect of repayment was a great inducement to their reconcilement to the meaſure which annihilated their government. When the act of the Scotiſh parliament, confirming the treaty of union, was laid before the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh commons, they paſſed it without oppoſition.

But though the union of the kingdoms had now commenced in the eye of the law, it could ſcarce be conſidered as an entire and incorporating union.

The only circumſtance in which he could not blame his fortune, was, that a very favourable ſeaſon had provided his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with plenty of grain<note n="R" place="bottom">Political annals, 1707</note>. But he was in great want of money to pay his troops, as well as to provide his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with thoſe implements of war, which he had loſt, on every ſide, to the enemy, in the preceding ſummer. To obtain a kind of remedy to this evil, he fell upon an expedient, which diſtreſſed the nation while it ruined the credit of government. In imitation of the exchequer-bills circulated by the government of England, he iſſued bills upon the mint, to the amount of ſeventy millions of livres<note n="S" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.

Another was aſſembled, by the Mareſchal de Villars, in the neighbourhood of Straſbourg. A body of men was ordered to rendezvous in Navarre, another in Rouſſillon, and reinforcements were ſent to the army commanded by the Duke of Berwick in Spain. The year began, with one inſtance of ſucceſs on the part of France. Majorca was retaken by the Count de Villars, on the fifth of January. But this tranſitory gleam of

Modena<note n="T" place="bottom">Feb. 10.</note> and Milan ſurrendered themſelves ſucceſſively to the allies. The whole kingdom of Naples was reduced, either by the treachery of the inhabitants or the force of the enemy; and the few places in the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Savoy and in the Milaneſe, that were ſtill held by garriſons of French or Spaniards, fell, one by one, before the end of the campaign<note n="U" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, tom iii</note>.</p>

The Engliſh and Portugueze being poſſeſſed, in the name of Charles the Third, of the kingdoms of Catalonia, Arragon, and Valencia, reſolved under their generals, the Earl of Galway and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Las-Minas, to penetrate into New-Caſtile. Having, for that purpoſe, paſſed the river Xucar, they advanced to Almanza. The Duke of Berwick, who had juſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the place, heſitated not a moment to give them battle. The action extended from wing to wing. The Engliſh infantry penetrated the center of the enemy. But the Portugueze foot giving way, and Berwick's cavalry having, at the ſame time, thrown the horſe of the allies in diſorder, the battle was ſoon decided in favour of the French. Never victory was more complete. Six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the allies either lay dead on the field of battle, or were ſlain in the purſuit. Five general officers, ſeven brigadiers, twenty-five colonels, above eight hundred other officers, and nine thouſand ſoldiers, were either taken priſoners, or, being ſurrounded in the mountains, were forced to ſurrender. All the cannon, ſtandards, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, equipage, and baggage of the vanquiſhed fell into the hands of the enemy. Las-Minas made his eſcape, with ſome cavalry, to Xativa. The Earl of Galway, with a party of horſe, taking the rout towards Catalonia, ſtopt not his flight till he arrived at Tortoſa, near the mouth of the Ebro. The Duke of Orleans, taking the command of the French army, the day after the battle, purſued the victory with great vigour.

The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the rebellion in Hungary, combined with the habitual inactivity of the court of Vienna, had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the efforts of the houſe of Auſtria extremely lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, on the Upper Rhine. The Margrave of Bareith, who ſucceeded to the command of the Imperialiſts, upon the death of the Prince of Baden, led an army, inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in point of numbers, and ill-provided with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the field. The French army, under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal de Villars, having paſſed the Rhine at Straſbourg, forced the lines at Stolhoffen, laid the duchy of Wirtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg under contribution, entered Swabia, and penetrated to the Danube. But when Villars was meditating mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which might change the whole face of the war, he was forced to weaken his army by great detachments into France itſelf, which was now attacked within its limits, by the allies. Towards the end of the campaign, the Elector of Hannover took the command of the army of the empire; and Count Mercy having ſurpriſed the Marquis de Vivant at Offembourg, the Mareſchal de Villars was forced to abandon all his ſchemes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the Rhine<note n="Y" place="bottom">Hiſt. d'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne, tom. vii.

He complained of an inſult com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Count Zobor, chamberlain to his Imperial Majeſty, on the Baron Stralenheim, the Swediſh envoy. Though all reaſonable ſatisfaction was given by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0709200302:358"/>
the King of Sweden, with an obſtinacy ſuitable to his character, increaſed his complaints and multiplied his demands. He peremptorily reuired, that five hundred Ruſſians, to whom the court of Vienna had given refuge in the Auſtrian dominions, ſhould be delivered into his hands. He inſiſted, that the Emperor ſhould immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decide the affair of the election of Lubec, in favour of the adminiſtrator of Holſtein. That the Proteſtants of Sileſia ſhould be indulged with the free exerciſe of their religion, according to the treaty of Weſtphalia. That his Imperial Majeſty ſhould relinquiſh all pretenſions to the quota, which the King of Sweden had neglected to furniſh, according to the tenure by which he held his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in Germany; and that the whole Swediſh army, in their return through Sileſia and Poland, ſhould be maintained at the charge of the court of Vienna<note n="Z" place="bottom">Hiſt. de Suede, 1707.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">He thrown wantonly the balance of Europe from his hands.</note> The court of Vienna was, by no means in a condition to refuſe theſe dictatorial terms. But the Queen of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and the States were alarmed, leſt the pride of the Emperor Joſeph ſhould overcome his attention to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the allies.

The Duke, no ſtranger himſelf to the power of money over mankind, conſulted the Elector of Hannover<note n="A" place="bottom">Hannover-papers, 1707.</note>, about the ſums to be given, as annual penſions, to the Counts Piper and Hermelin, who conducted the counſels of Charles the Twelfth. The Elector adviſed, that two thouſand pounds ſterling ſhould be ſecured for the firſt, and one thouſand for the latter; and that one year's penſion ſhould be paid in advance<note n="B" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The Duke arriving at Alt-Ranſtadt, where the King of Sweden held his head quarters, was received with a degree of politeneſs, conſidering the harſh and uncomplying character of that Prince.

England and Holland having guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teed the promiſes of the Emperor to the demands of Charles, that Prince, after having, for more than a year, kept the allies in ſuſpence, and actually held the balance of Europe, threw the whole, at once, from his hands, and, repaſſing the Oder, entered Poland, in purſuit of fruitleſs victories<note n="C" place="bottom">Hiſt. de Nord, tom. ii.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Siege of Toulon.</note> The moſt memorable event of the year was the ſiege of Toulon, and the miſcarriage of the allies before that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant place. The reduction of the Spaniſh dominions in Italy, and the capitulation ſigned at Milan in March, by which the French army abandoned that country, left the Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene at freedom to carry the war into the enemy's country. In concert with England and Holland a project was formed, either to deſtroy or take Toulon and Marſeilles; an enterpriſe, if crowned with ſucceſs, which could not fail to be highly beneficial to the maritime powers, as well as of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the confederates in general. The Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene, having, for ſome time, amuſed the French with marches and countermarches, turned ſuddenly toward the ſhore of the Mediterranean, forced the paſſage of the river Var, advanced along the coaſt of Provence, and, after a long march, through a hot, rugged, and inhoſpitable country, arrived before Toulon, on the twenty-ſixth of July.

The Duke of Burgundy, with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable force, was on his march to cut off their retreat from Nice. Of twelve thouſand horſe, ſcarce four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were fit for ſervice, in that rocky country, the iron for ſhoes expected from Genoa, having been detained by contrary winds.

                  <note place="margin">Inactive campaign in Flanders. Loſſes at ſea.</note> In Flanders nothing of importance happened during the campaign. The French, under the Duke de Vendôme, prudently avoided an action; and they managed their motions ſo well, that they furniſhed the enemy no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of attacking them, with advantage. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal operations at ſea, were confined to the fruitleſs ſiege of Toulon. The Chevalier de Forbin had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of taking two Engliſh men of war, with twenty merchantmen; and what was ſtill more fortunate for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to make his eſcape after an engagement with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior ſquadron.

That admiral, on the twenty-ninth of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſailed from Gibraltar, with a fleet of fifteen ſhips of the line and ſome frigates. Having arrived in the mouth of the channel, on the night of the twenty-ſecond of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, by a miſtake in his courſe, he ſteered directly on ſome dangerous rocks, to the weſtward of the iſlands of Scilly.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections on the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</note> The campaign of the year 1707, though in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree favourable to the houſe of Bourbon, ſcarce ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their misfortunes. The conqueſt of Naples balanced the benefits derived from the victory obtained at Almanza; and the ſiege of Toulon, though unſucceſsful on the part of the allies, was extremely detrimental to France. The enemy, in their march and retreat through Provence, ruined a great extent of country. The attempt defeated the projects of France on the ſide of Germany, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding her forces. Villars having penetrated to the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube, was forced to repaſs the Rhine; and to relinquiſh to an enemy, who could not meet him before in the field, all the advantages of a campaign, that ſeemed to threaten to change the whole face of affairs. A degree of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was added to the misfortunes of the court of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles. The Duke of Savoy, whoſe capital was beſieged by a French army, in the preceding campaign, was at the head of a powerful invaſion in the dominions of France, in the preſent year. But the conduct of the court of France was now as feeble as her misfortunes were numerous. The Salique law ſeemed to have been made in vain, in a country deſtined to be governed and ruined by women. Madame de Maintenon, though advanced in years, maintained her influence over the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated mind of the King. Flattery to an aged miſtreſs, became a better title than merit, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of armies; and, thus, the folly of his own councils became as fatal to Lewis as the arms of the confederates.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Diſcontents in Scotland.</note> THOUGH the Union of the two Britiſh kingdoms had been carried in their reſpective parliaments by a great majority, that meaſure was far from receiving the general ſanction of the people. Men who were apt to urge ſpeculative arguments againſt expediency, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a degree of juſtice, that no repreſentative of a nation had a right to diſſolve the conſtitution from which
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0709200302:363"/>
they derived their own political exiſtence. The genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Scotiſh nation, either ſwayed by their pride, or yielding to their prejudices, were loud in their complaints; and wanted nothing but leaders to appeal from their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to the deciſion of the ſword. The populace, in particular, were ſo eager to take up arms, that the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and chiefs were forced to avoid mixing with their vaſſals, for fear of being inſulted for not leading them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the field<note n="A" place="bottom">Hooke's Negociations.</note>. The miniſter of England, in the mean time, either from negligence or deſign<note n="B" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1707.</note>, had made no preparations againſt the ſudden incurſion of a people whom he knew to be inflamed to a degree of madneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Intrigues of France.</note> Happily for England, and, perhaps, ultimately for the Scots themſelves, the court of France was ſtill more deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of counſels than of power. Inſtead of liſtening to the earneſt ſolicitations of the malecontents, in ſending the Pretender, with a force ſufficient to protect his perſon, to Scotland, they diſpatched colonel Hooke into that kingdom, with inſtructions more calculated to depreſs the ſpirits of the Jacobites, than to rouſe them to arms. Hooke arriving ſoon after the receſs of parliament, made a ſecret progreſs through the northern counties, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the leaders of the Jacobites, letters from the King of France, as well as from the Pretender. The Dukes of Gordon and Athol, the Earls of Errol, Mariſhal, Panmure, and Strathmore, the Viſcount Stormont, and in general, all the nobility and gentry to the North of the Forth, and many whoſe eſtates lay to the South of that river, received him with gladneſs, and expreſſed their readineſs to take up arms for the exiled family. Their enthuſiaſm in favour of the Pretender and averſion to the Union were ſo great, that though it was apparent Hooke's object was to engage them in every thing, and the French King in nothing, they ſigned a general me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, referring implicitly the expected aid from France to the generoſity of Lewis the Fourteenth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hooke's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations.</note> In this memorial, after a complimentary preamble to the French King, they ſignified their earneſt deſire that the Pretender ſhould be immediately ſent to Scotland. They affirmed that, upon his arrival, he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0709200302:364"/>
without oppoſition as king; and that the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed government would inſtantly vaniſh without making the leaſt effort for its own ſupport. Out of the great number of men that were to be led by his adherents to his ſtandard, they propoſed to ſelect twenty-five thouſand foot and five thouſand horſe. Theſe they promiſed to clothe, to arm, and to provide with proviſions till they ſhould march into England. But, upon that event they inſinuated, that a monthly ſubſidy ought to be paid by France, ſhould the war be prolonged for any time, by the reſiſtance of the Engliſh nation to the perſon whom the memorialiſts called their lawful King. They ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured the moſt Chriſtian King, that the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from an averſion to the Union, were unanimous in their wiſhes for the reſtoration of the exiled family; and that, as they threw themſelves under his Majeſty's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, they were confident he would effectually ſupport their cauſe. They, however, left the time, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the ſtrength to be ſent, entirely to himſelf. The whole ſtrain of the memorial was ſpiritleſs, though vehement. It expreſſed an enthuſiaſm for an immediate inſurrection, which Lewis, had he been more attentive to his own intereſt, might have greatly improved to his advantage<note n="C" place="bottom">Hooke's Negociations.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Conduct of the court of St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</note> Together with this memorial, Hooke was charged with letters from the leaders of the malecontents to the Pretender and the French miniſtry. Having arrived in France, in the month of July, he laid the ſubſtance of his negociations before the court of Verſailles. The Earl of Middleton, who managed the affairs of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, attempted to add the weight of argument to the offers and ſolicitations of the Scots. He endeavoured to eſtabliſh the probability of the ſucceſs of an inſurrection in Scotland, by the recent and ſtill-exiſting reſiſtance of the Hungarians againſt the forces and efforts of the court of Vienna. He mentioned, as an example of the ſame kind, the inſurrection in the Cevennes, where a few peaſants, without any ſuccours from abroad, maintained themſelves ſo long againſt regular troops, commanded by Mareſchals of France. He averred, that nothing was ſo well calculated to terminate a war, as to carry it into the enemy's country. The King of Sweden, he ſaid, after
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0709200302:365"/>
a ſeries of victories, for five years, in Poland, found new enemies riſing, as it were, from the blood of the ſlain, till, by making a ſudden irruption into Saxony, he put, at once, an end to the war and the reign of King Auguſtus. He affirmed, that the enemies of France were convinced of the juſtneſs of theſe maxims; as appeared from their efforts in Spain, their attempts upon the Moſelle, their project of a deſcent on the coaſt of the ocean, and the preſent invaſion of the Duke of Savoy along the ſhore of the Mediterranean<note n="D" place="bottom">Middleton to M. de Chamillart.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Secret views of the Earl of Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin.</note> The repreſentations of Hooke, the arguments of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton, and the repeated and vehement ſolicitations of the Scots themſelves, were loſt on the court of Verſailles. Happily for Great Britain, the meaſures of the French miniſtry were too much diſconcerted with an invaſion of their own country, to think of carrying the war into that of the enemy. The ſullen ſilence which aroſe in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, from the anxious expectations of the diſcontented, was, in the mean time, miſtaken by the ſuperficial for an acquieſcence in the Union between the kingdoms. The affairs of England, in like manner, wore the face of tranquillity. The attention of the people being turned to the operations of the war, the bickerings between par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were either forgot or neglected. But to thoſe, who from judicious obſervations on the paſt, could penetrate into the future, a ſtorm ſeemed to be gathering behind the tranſient ſun-ſhine, which, to uſe a metaphor, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened at preſent the kingdom. The lord-treaſurer thinking, perhaps, that he had gone too far, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his principles, in accompliſhing the Union, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from his conduct, little anxious about its continuance. Every meaſure calculated to exaſperate the Scots againſt that treaty was adopted. Though the revenue of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had fallen under the management of the treaſury in England, on the firſt of May, no care had been taken to iſſue commiſſions for new officers.</p>

Theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, calculated to irritate the Scotiſh nation againſt the Engliſh, were accompanied with an internal relaxation of government, which raiſed a ſuſpicion, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, if not the Court, was in the intereſt of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled family. The correſpondence maintained between France and Scotland was no ſecret. But it paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out animadverſion; and no notice was taken of public rejoicings celebrated at Edinburgh, and other parts of Scotland, on the birth-day of the Pretender. The Scots conſidering all government in a manner diſſolved, by what they called the illegality of the Union, were at no pains to conceal their ſentiments; yet ſuch was the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineneſs of the miniſter, that he ſeemed to court an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and even an invaſion<note n="F" place="bottom">Stuart-papers.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues.</note> During this ſuſpicious conduct of Godolphin, he and the Duke of Marlborough continued to make their uſual aſſurances of fidelity and attachment to the court of St. Germains<note n="G" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1707.</note>. The Duke, in particular, ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate to their agents, that one cauſe of rejecting the propoſals of peace offered by France, was their not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending any ſtipulations in favour of the exiled fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note n="H" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, April 1707.</note>. The conduct of Marlborough with regard to that unfortunate race is unaccountable, except on the footing of principle. Neglected by the French and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſources themſelves, they were ſcarce worthy of being deceived, ſhould they even have the weakneſs to place any confidence in promiſes ſo often and ſo ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually made. Had their conviction of Marlborough's ſincerity been equal to the opinion which the world had formed of his power, they might, at leaſt, ſuppoſe, that their own misfortunes were drawing to an end. The Queen was in the poſſeſſion of his Dutcheſs. The affairs of the nation were either in the hands of his friends or in his own. The lord-treaſurer, who guided the whole line of internal buſineſs, was inſeperably connected with the fortune of his family. The Earl of Sunderland, his ſon-in-law, as ſecretary of ſtate, was poſſeſſed of the ſecrets of the kingdom; and either the ſplendour of his
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0709200302:367"/>
own actions, or the art of his conduct, had rendered parliament, in a manner, ſubſervient to his views.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Intrigues in the cabinet.</note> Notwithſtanding this appearance of firmneſs in the fabric reared by Marlborough, it was ſecretly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a manner that threatened its fall. The Whigs, either ſuſpecting the principles of Godolphin, or, what is more probable, from views upon his office and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, were preparing to attack his meaſures in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="I" place="bottom">Duke of Hamilton to the Pretender. May 1707.</note>. They were no ſtrangers to his political cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice; and they were determined to derive ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to themſelves from his weakneſs. But when prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were making againſt him without, he was privately attacked within the cabinet. A new female favourite had, in a great meaſure, ſupplanted the Ducheſs of Marlborough in the affections of the Queen, or rather in the dominion which ſhe had eſtabliſhed over the mind of that timid and eaſy princeſs. Mr. Harley, who had been ſecretary of ſtate for ſome years, had gained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of credit with the Queen. To ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his own intereſt, he ſecured the confidence and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the new favourite. The great weight, and the almoſt irreſiſtible power which Marlborough and the connexions of his family had eſtabliſhed, could not have failed to raiſe, in ſome degree, the jealouſy of the Queen, who was actually a mere cypher in their hands. She, therefore, liſtened to the ſuggeſtions of Harley; who, preſuming on the manifeſt change in the mind of the ſovereign, began to act no longer in dependence on the miniſter<note n="J" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. iv.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Oppoſition formed.</note> While Harley employed his intrigues in the cloſet againſt Marlborough and Godolphin, a formidable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to their meaſures was preparing againſt the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of parliament. As long as the people were amuſed with ſplendid victories abroad, they complained not of the burden of the war at home. But when the progreſs of conqueſt was ſtopt, by the misfortune at Almanza and the raiſing of the ſiege of Toulon, a general inclination for peace appeared in the nation. The Whigs, offended in the perſon of one of their leaders, encouraged this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific diſpoſition among the people. The Lord Wharton,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0709200302:368"/>
forgetting the animoſity between the Whigs and the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his own reſentment againſt the miniſtry, had paid a viſit to the Earl of Nottingham, with propoſitions to join the high-church party to humble Marlborough and Godolphin. The latter noblemen, from views of their own, were highly averſe to pacific meaſures. But the current ran violently againſt the war, till Marlborough returned to the kingdom. The chief reaſon oppoſed by the Duke to a peace, was that France, preſuming on her ſucceſs at Almanza, had receded from the terms which ſhe had offered the preceding year. He pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Lewis the Fourteenth had then promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Spain and the Indies. The recovery of the whole Spaniſh monarchy out of the hands of the houſe of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, he knew, had been the chief object of the Engliſh nation in their warm proſecution of the war, from the hopes that they had conceived of the great mercantile ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages reſulting from a treaty already concluded with the houſe of Auſtria. The Duke inſinuated, that to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that great object, there was a neceſſity for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the war; and this argument, though founded on a miſrepreſentation of the fact, had great weight with the trading part of the nation.<note n="K" place="bottom">Stuart-papers.

                  <note place="margin">Firſt parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> During theſe intrigues, on both ſides, the firſt parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Great Britain met at Weſtminſter. The Queen coming to the houſe of peers, on the twenty-third of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, directed the commons to chuſe a Speaker. Many conſidered this ceremony unneceſſary, as the parliament had not been diſſolved, but dropt and afterwards renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by proclamation, in terms of an act for that purpoſe. All diſputes concerning the legality of the election of a ſpeaker were prevented by Smith's being again placed in the chair. On the ſixth of November, the Queen, as uſual, made a ſpeech from the throne. To a brief detail of the ſtate of affairs abroad, ſhe annexed the cuſtomary demand of ſupplies, and concluded with exhortations to affection toward her own perſon and government, and unanimity among themſelves. The commons having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Queen's ſpeech, voted an addreſs of thanks, on the tenth of November. The houſe of peers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0709200302:369"/>
were not equally complaiſant. The diſcontents of ſome diſappointed lords, joined ſeveral votes to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party againſt Marlborough and Godolphin. When an addreſs to the throne was moved, a motion for conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt the ſtate of the nation was carried. A zeal for the redreſs of public evils aroſe, in proportion to the height of private reſentment. Whigs and Tories were promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly in oppoſition. The leaders of the firſt had been too much neglected in the diſtribution of places. The latter had neither forgot nor forgiven the means that had been uſed to deprive them of power<note n="L" place="bottom">MS. of the Times.</note>

The Duke of Marlborough, with all his abilities and ſucceſs in the field, ſuffered acts of meanneſs, ſelfiſhneſs, and avarice to ſtain the fame, which he had acquired in the world. The Earl of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphin, though a man of abilities, carried the indolence, ill-temper, and peeviſhneſs of his private character into his public conduct. The reputation which both had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, with a degree of juſtice, in their reſpective de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, had a viſible effect on their own minds. The ſelf-ſufficiency which is ſeldom ſeparated from ſucceſs, had rendered them negligent of men who poſſeſſed abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſupport their meaſures in parliament. Inſtead of permitting the places and emoluments of government to run in the channel of parliamentary intereſt, they grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their own friends and dependents, and thus by exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ambitious from office, they furniſhed them with leiſure as well as with reſentment to oppoſe their own meaſures.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Inquiry into miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the admiralty.</note> The lords reſolving themſelves into a committee of their whole houſe, to conſider of the ſtate of the nation, a petition was preſented, in the name of more than two hundred merchants of London, complaining of great loſſes at ſea, for want of cruizers and convoys. In the proſecution of the inquiry great abuſes were diſcovered in the department of the admiralty, which was managed by a council, in the name of the Prince of Denmark, who bore the name but not the power of lord admiral. The committee having made a very unfavourable report
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0709200302:370"/>
to the houſe it was tranſmitted to the Prince of Denmark. An anſwer was returned in his name, which attempted to juſtify the ſeveral charges contained in the report. But the moſt remarkable part of the paper was its concluſion, which contained very ſevere ſtrictures on the management of ſea affairs in the late reign. In the war carried on by King William it appeared, that four thouſand merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had been taken by the enemy; which at a medium fell little ſhort of five hundred ſhips every year. The truth is, that during the two reigns which immediately ſucceeded the Revolution, naval affairs were much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. Great fleets were equipped to ſecond the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations by land, while the trade of the nation was left a prey to flying ſquadrons and privateers<note n="M" place="bottom">Journals of the lords.</note>.</p>

She, however, made a general anſwer to the addreſs of the lords, and promiſed to protect the trade of her ſubjects. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the ſtate of naval affairs, was ſucceeded by an examination into the military operations in Spain; where the firſt ſucceſs of the Engliſh nation had terminated in loſs and diſgrace. The Earl of Peterborough, who had performed ſignal ſervices in that kingdom, had been re-called in the preceding Auguſt. The Tories, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Earl of Galway, magnified the merit of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough; while the Whigs made ſevere remarks on his conduct. A written complaint againſt Peterborough, had been tranſmitted by King Charles to England. The paper was laid before the two houſes. But Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, in his own juſtification, produced ſuch a number of witneſſes and papers, that the parliament, aſter ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two weeks on the ſubject, were ſo much tired of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh affairs and the Earl, that they dropt both, without any animadverſion<note n="N" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

In conſidering that part of her Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſpeech, which required the parliament to make the Union more complete, they came to ſeveral important reſolves. They voted, that there ſhould be but one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy council in Great Britain. That the militia of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſhould be placed on the ſame footing with that of England. That the powers of juſtices of the peace ſhould be the ſame throughout the united kingdom. That, for the better and more expeditious adminiſtration of juſtice, the lords of juſticiary ſhould go circuits, twice a year; and that the writs for electing members to ſerve in parliament for Scotland, ſhould be returned in the ſame manner as in England.<note n="Q" place="bottom">Dec. 11.</note>.

The commons, having concurred with the lords in an addreſs containing this reſolution, the two houſes preſented the ſame, in a body, on the twenty-third of December<note n="R" place="bottom">Dec. 23.</note>. The Queen, in her anſwer, aſſured her parliament, that ſhe was fully of opinion, that no peace could either be ſaſe or honourable, till the entire monarchy of Spain ſhould be reſtored to the houſe of Auſtria. She, at the ſame time, promiſed, in compliance with the other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their addreſs, to continue her moſt preſſing inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Emperor, to haſten further ſuccours for Spain, under the command of the Prince of Savoy.

Harley, who, perhaps, was not entirely ignorant of the attachment of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and Godolphin to the exiled family, found means to raiſe the jealouſy of the Whigs, while, at the ſame time, he was ſaid to have contrived to foment the bad humour of the Tories againſt the management of public affairs. An accident, however, furniſhed the enemies of Harley with an opportunity of revenge. The Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal de Tallard, ſtill a priſoner in England, wrote fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to Chamillart, one of the miniſters of Lewis the Fourteenth.

He ſtill retained his influence with the Queen. The principles avowed publickly by the Tories, being moſt agreeable to all ſovereigns, Anne ſeems to have entertained an affection for that party, when even ſhe excluded them from office. Marlborough and Godolphin, as far as they were ſwayed by principle, were in the intereſt of the excluded family. But they had employed the Whigs, as more active and better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantined with buſineſs<note n="W" place="bottom">MS. anecdote</note> than the Tories. They had always found the latter as unſteady in their conduct, as they were violent in their ſchemes. Harley, though bred a diſſenter, and having all along avowed whiggiſh principles, ſacrificed his opinions to his love of power; and, by flattering the prejudices of the Queen, in favour of the excluded party, hoped to govern the nation through their ſupport and aſſiſtance. But though he was poſſeſſed of courage to undertake the adminiſtration of affairs on theſe terms, the times were not yet ripe for ſo precipitate a change. The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Godolphin complained of Harley's intrigues to the Queen. But that Princeſs heard them without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved. They reſolved, therefore, to extort from her fears what they could not derive from her prudence. They threatened both to reſign their places; and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Harley from the office of ſecretary of ſtate<note n="X" place="bottom">Feb. 11, 1708.</note>, was preferred by the Queen, as the leaſt evil.

They had been, from the beginning of the ſeſſion, at the bottom of the inquiries made in both houſes, into the conduct of the war; and now they had added reſentment to what formerly was only ambition.

The anſwer of the Queen was delayed to the eighteenth; and when it was received, it was deemed unſatisfactory. The lords continuing their inquiries into the ſtate of naval affairs, preſented a long addreſs againſt the miſmanagements in that department. Upon the whole, the complexion of both houſes ſeemed greatly altered with regard to the miniſtry. The weight of government had ſecured, hitherto, a majority, upon the moſt trying queſtions, in the houſe of commons.

The two houſes, as upon all occaſions of danger, joined in the uſual addreſs of lives and fortunes; and the commons, to ſtrengthen the hands of government, introduced a bill for ſuſpending the act of <hi>habeas corpus.</hi> The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the miniſtry kept pace with the zeal of parliament. Sir George Byng, with a ſquadron of twenty-three ſhips of war, had already ſtretched over to Dunkirk. Ten battalions of Engliſh troops were ordered from Flanders.

To deceive the Britiſh admiral, ſhould he return to his ſtation, they had placed an equal number of veſſels in the road. The ſquadron was commanded by M. de Fourbin.

The ſtate of Scotland was, in every reſpect, favourable to, at leaſt, the temporary ſucceſs of the deſign. The

moſt of the nobles, four-fifths of the gentry, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, a greater proportion of the common people, were inflamed into a degree of deſpair, at what they deemed the indignity of the terms of Union between the two kingdoms. The injudicious violence with which the new laws for collecting the revenue were introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scotland, bore the appearance of a deſign in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to rouſe the inhabitants to ſome deſperate attempt, to break a treaty, which he himſelf had accompliſhed with ſuch appearance of zeal. Swarms of ſurveyors, collectors, and other officers, were ſent from England.

There were only two thouſand five hundred regular troops in Scotland, and theſe were known to be diſaffected. The money for the equivalent was, at the ſame time, in the caſtle of Edinburgh. That fortreſs was not in a ſtate to defeat the ſlighteſt effort of an enemy<note n="K" place="bottom">Hooke's Negociations.</note>. A Dutch fleet had juſt run a-ground, on the coaſt of the county of Angus, with ammunition, cannon, muſkets, and money. The act of ſecurity had placed arms in the hands of the lower ſort of people, of which they had not yet been deprived, by the repeal of that law. The High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, though from the ſituation of their country, and the ſtate of ſociety eſtabliſhed among the clans, they felt not the ſuppoſed grievances of the Union, were, from a national pride, attached to a race of Princes, whom they deemed their countrymen. The officers of government in Scotland, were ſo ſenſible of the untenable condition

of that country, that they had already made preparations for taking refuge in the town of Berwick. The imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſubmiſſion of the whole kingdom, and a general acknowledgment of his authority would, therefore, have been the infallible conſequence of the Pretender's landing with the appearance of a regular force<note n="L" place="bottom">Hooke's Negociations.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Views of the Scotiſh Jacobites.</note> The diſcontented Scots had formed a reſolution of invading England, as ſoon as their own country ſhould ſubmit itſelf to the authority of the perſon whom they called their lawful King. They propoſed, with ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand foot and three thouſand horſe of their own nation, in conjunction with their French auxiliaries, to diſtreſs London, by the immediate ſeizure of Newcaſtle, and by ſtopping the coal-trade. The regular force to the ſouth of the Tweed was incapable of meeting the Scots in the field. In Flanders there were only eighteen Britiſh regiments, and one third of theſe were their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. The latter, inſtead of oppoſing their projects, would, they hoped, join and forward their views. They knew, that, without the conſent of parliament, the Queen could not call<note n="M" place="bottom">Ibid. Stuart papers, paſſim.</note> any foreign troops to her aid.

The diſſolution of the Union, the repeal of the act of ſettlement, the preſent poſſeſſion of Scotland, the eventual ſucceſſion of England to her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they hoped to derive all from the fears, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, from the affection of the Queen.

In the Saliſbury, the only ſhip which had fallen into the hands of the Britiſh fleet, the Lord Griffin, who had followed the late King James to France, was taken, and received ſentence of death on a former outlawry.

The Duke of Marlborough, having left London on the twenty-ninth of March, arrived the next evening at the Hague, where he was met by Prince Eugene of Savoy. Theſe two generals, having ſettled with the States the operations of the ſummer, repaired by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent roads, to Hannover, to reconcile the Elector to the regulations which they had ſettled, without his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, with regard to the army which his Highneſs commanded, in the cloſe of the preceding year, on the Upper-Rhine. The Duke of Marlborough, having placed himſelf at the head of the confederates, in the neighbourhood of Ghent, in the end of May, the French took the field on that ſide, with an army ſuperior to the allies, in point of number. They were commanded, in the name of the Duke of Burgundy, by the Duke de Vendôme. Though they were poſſeſſed of ſtrength ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to cope with the enemy in the field, they choſe rather to rely on ſtratagem and ſurpriſe, than on the more uncertain ſucceſs of open force. The Elector of Bavaria, during his long government in Flanders, had gained an influence among the Flemings, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, after the greateſt part of the country had been loſt to the allies, in the fatal battle of Ramillies. He either obtained, by his intrigues, or purchaſed with the money of France, an abſolute promiſe from the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates of the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, and Bruges to open their gates to the troops of the houſe of Bourbon. The extortions of the allies, of which neither Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough nor his friend Cadogan had been unconcerned ſpectators<note n="Q" place="bottom">Mem. of the Generality of Ghent, MS.</note>, contributed to this projected revolt, as much as the intrigues of the Elector of Bavaria.</p>

The Duke of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, accuſed, perhaps very unjuſtly, of being privy to the treachery, from intereſted views, was incapable of preventing its effects.

The battle, however, was by no means deciſive. But the fears and bad conduct of the French, yielded to the allies all the conſequences of a compleat victory. No baggage, no cannon were loſt. It was the repulſe of a party, rather than a general rout. The allies expected nothing but the renewal of battle upon better terms the next morning. But the French retreated through five different routes in the night.

That city, fortified with all the art of

The particulars of ſieges are not intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at any conſiderable diſtance of time. The Duke of Vendôme attempted, in vain, to relieve the place, by endeavouring to cut off the convoys of the enemy from beyond the Scheld and from Oſtend. In attacking a party of Engliſh at Winnendal, a French detachment was defeated with the loſs of their cannon and all their implements of war. In attempting to attack the enemy before Liſle, though joined by the Duke of Berwick with a great reinforcement, Vendôme was twice diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, after a fruitleſs cannonade.

The beſiegers carried no part of the works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a regular and obſtinate battle; and they were ſcarce maſters of one place, when they were driven from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and put in danger of being forced to yield the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which they had gained with ſo much valour and blood. But the difficulties of the allies were not ended with the conqueſt of Liſle. They had loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eighteen and twenty thouſand men before the place, which had rendered their army much inferior to the French. They were, at the ſame time, under the neceſſity of repaſſing the Scheld, or to diſtribute the troops in winter-quarters in the ſmall ſpace of country comprehended between Liſle, Menin, and Courtray. To paſs a river whoſe banks were occupied by an enemy ſuperior in number was dangerous as well as difficult. To remain in the neighbourhood of Liſle for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, would have been to abandon the reſt of Flanders, the province of Brabant, Guelderland, and a part of the territories of the States, to the mercy of the French. The Duke of Marlborough, who always treated fortune as if ſhe had made an agreement to favour all his deſigns,

The Elector of Bavaria had ſat down before that place the day before the allies had croſſed the river.

The cities which the French had recovered through the treachery of the magiſtrates, were again loſt to the enemy. The retaking of Bruges and Plaſſendal followed immediately the paſſage of the Scheld. Ghent ſurrendered, after a feeble reſiſtance, about the middle of December. At the cloſe of a cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, where every motion of the French was marked with ſome loſs or ſome error, the Duke of Vendôme went to Verſailles. He durſt not paſs through Paris, dreading the conſequences of the public hatred which his conduct had raiſed.

When, in conſequence of the battle of Ramillies, the greateſt part of Flanders was reduced by the allies, the chief management of the conquered country fell into the hands of general Cadogan, who ſucceeded Mr. Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as ambaſſador from England to the States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note n="W" place="bottom">MS.

The conduct of theſe generals, after retaking the two cities, was calculated to juſtify ſuſpicions of the worſt kind.

On the ſide of Italy, where much was expected, nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive was performed. The Duke of Savoy had made great preparations in the winter; but it was late in the ſummer before he took the field.

He deſigned to paſs through the territories of the Swiſs, to join the troops of the empire in Alſace, and to penetrate into France on that ſide. He was oppoſed by the Mareſchal de Villars. But, notwithſtanding the vigilance of that officer, the Duke found means, by making himſelf maſter of Exilles, La Perouſe, and Feneſtrelles, to open a paſſage into France, while he ſecured his own dominions againſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture invaſions from that kingdom<note n="D" place="bottom">Hiſt. d'Angleterre, tom. ii.</note>.</p>

Though Charles the Third had not a force ſufficient to face the Duke of Orleans in the field, the latter was prevented from making any deciſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs by the unprovided condition of his army. He, however, took Tortoſa, on the eleventh of July. Denia and Alicant, in the kingdom of Valencia, fell into the hands of the French before the end of the campaign. The Duke de Noailles, oppoſed by the Prince of Darmſtads, performed nothing of importance, except providing his troops with proviſions during the campaign at the expence of the Catalonians. The ſummer paſſed in a ſtate of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute inactivity on the ſide of Portugal. The French, though ſuperior in numbers, attempted nothing. But though the generals on neither ſide gained any credit by their conduct in the field, they deſerved praiſe for their wiſdom and humanity.

When the Engliſh fleet appeared, the monks, gained by the cardinal Grimani, ran in bodies to the ſtreets and public places, holding the crucifix in their hands. They aſſured the inhabitants, who flocked around them, that God had made uſe of Heretics to give them a better maſter. They made ſuch an impreſſion on the populace, that the Viceroy, the Marquis of Jamaica, was forced to accept ſuch terms as Leake condeſcended to grant. The fleet commanded by the ſame admiral added to this important conqueſt the reduction of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norca. The iſland itſelf was leſs conſiderable in itſelf than Sardinia; but more valuable to the Britiſh nation, on account of the excellent harbour of Port-Mahon. The French and Spaniards loſt their courage with their good fortune. The forts which defended Port-Mahon, though provided with every neceſſary for ſuſtaining a ſiege, made ſcarce any ſhew of defence.

He loved the Tories, as they had been the chief inſtruments in procuring for him an eventual penſion, in caſe he had ſurvived the Queen.

Upon the attempt of an invaſion from France, in the preceding year, ſeveral peers and gentlemen of rank were ſeized, by the procurement of the Scotiſh lords in the miniſtry, and were brought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to London. Though all were ſuſpected of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a correſpondence with the invaders, and many were actually guilty, proof could be carried home to none. They were, therefore, diſmiſſed. But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and expence which they incurred upon bare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, had induced mankind in general to conclude, that they had been treated with unjuſt ſeverity. This circumſtance, together with a diſpute between the court of juſticiary and the Queen's advocate in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, concerning the trial of ſome Jacobites in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, induced the lords to introduce a bill for extending the laws of treaſon already eſtabliſhed in England, to the whole kingdom of Great Britain.

He was not ignorant that he had many enemies who ſuſpected him of treaſonable practices, and ſome who were actually poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of proofs ſufficient to ruin his reputation, if not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his head. The Marquis of Annandale, it is ſaid, either by accident or art, had poſſeſſed himſelf of an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal letter of the lord-treaſurer to the court of St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. In the beginning of the preſent ſeſſion, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis had petitioned againſt the undue election of one of the peers for Scotland; and, by inſinuating that he was privy to Godolphin's ſecret attachment to the excluded family, he obtained the weight of government and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſeat in the houſe of peers. The Earl of Wharton, perceiving the unexpected ſucceſs of Annandale, treated with that nobleman for the uſe of his valuable manuſcript. He obtained the letter, and was inſtantly declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland. The miſchievous Wharton was at no pains to keep the ſecret. The whole junto derived benefit from the diſcovery. Pembroke, Somers, Dorſet, and their retainers, demanded offices and were gratified. But ſtill Godolphin was in danger, till the act of grace paſſed, in the beginning of the preſent year. The bill ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed calculated chiefly for the lord-treaſurer himſelf. Few things were pardoned except all correſpondence with the court of St. Germains. Wharton, who hoped to derive ſtill greater advantages from the letter, which he is ſaid to have either purchaſed or obtained from the Marquis of Annandale, was completely outwitted by the Earl of Godolphin. The latter, by aſſuring him that the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial buſineſs of the ſeſſion was over, had induced his lordſhip to repair to his government of Ireland. But the firſt intelligence he received at Dublin was, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter had eſcaped from his hands under the ſanction of an act of grace.</p>

attack his character and to ruin his power. The Tories, in particular, had joined a perſonal quarrel againſt Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, to the uſual violence of men excluded from the poſſeſſion of influence and office. They were furniſhed by the Duke himſelf with a circumſtance ſuitable to their deſires. Cardonnel, Marlborough's ſecretary, in writing to the Queen a detail of the battle of Winnendal, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the whole honour of the affair to General Cadogan, the favourite of his maſter, who had not the leaſt ſhare in the action. General Webb, to whoſe activity and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the victory was principally aſcribed, was not even named in the letter. Cardonnel's account was made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. Webb was enraged. He quitted the army, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to London. His own account of the action was printed. The Tories abbetted him in the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and a vote of thanks was paſſed, not without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſevere and perſonal reflections on Marlborough, who was accuſed of making uſe of unjuſtifiable means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the merit of a deſerving officer.

In one ſingular addreſs to the throne, an unuſual unanimity appeared. The Queen, as head of the church, had ordered, on the thirteenth of January, that the form of prayer, for iſſue of her body to ſucceed her in the throne, ſhould be diſcontinued after the eighth of the next March, the anniverſary of her acceſſion to the crown. Mr. Watſon, ſon to the Lord Rockingham, moved, in the houſe of commons, on the twenty-fifth of January, that an addreſs ſhould be preſented to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to moderate her grief, and to entertain thoughts of a ſecond marriage. Though the motion ſeemed to convey a degree of ridicule, it paſſed the commons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition, and received the concurrence of the lords.

But the funds, upon which they could be charged, were not ſo eaſily found. The miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, at length, fell upon an expedient which anſwered their neceſſities. They propoſed to double the capital of the bank, and to prolong to one and twenty years its time, which was otherwiſe to have expired on the firſt of Auguſt 1711. The terms obtained by government for theſe advantages, were four hundred thouſand pounds, at ſix per cent. and the circulation of two millions four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds in exchequer-bills.

So eager were the people for employing their money on ſuch advantageous terms, that in leſs than four hours the whole ſum was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Though the rapidity with which the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was filled, was rather a proof of the neceſſities of government than of the wealth of the people, the facility with which ſuch a great ſum was raiſed, was calculated to give a high opinion of the flouriſhing ſtate of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to foreigners. They perceived, with a degree of aſtoniſhment, that after ſuch great exertions, in a war of many years, the nation ſeemed to be ſo far from being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, that more than the whole annual revenue of ſtates deemed powerful on the continent, was raiſed in a few hours in this iſland<note n="T" place="bottom">Hiſt. of Europe, 1709.

The two generals having gained ſo many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and ſucceeded in all their arduous and important undertakings, had acquired as much influence with the allies, as they had excited of terror among their enemies. Heinſius had been the depoſitary of the ſecrets of King William. He had been raiſed by that Prince to the place of firſt miniſter, and had the good fortune to preſerve the authority which he had received, by being the chain which united the States with the grand confederacy formed by his late patron againſt the houſe of Bourbon. All the three ſeemed to have a perſonal intereſt in oppoſing the peace. The Duke of Marlborough, beſides the thriſt of glory, which was probably common to him with other men, had an opportunity, by a continuance of the war, to gratify a paſſion ſtill more predominant in his mind, the love of money. Prince Eugene, being a ſoldier of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, had no buſineſs with tranquillity, in which generals are commonly laid aſide to ruſt with their ſwords. Hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, beſides the dread of loſing his importance at home,

They were no ſtrangers to the true ſtate of the firſt. They built much upon the prudence of the latter, and the character of patriotiſm which he had already acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They knew that Marlborough, while he poſſeſſed ſuch credit and authority abroad, was ſecretly undermined by his enemies at home. They were told, that a great part of the Britiſh nation were offended at ſeeing the power, influence, and emoluments of government, ſo long divided between the Duke, the Earl of Godolphin, and their friends. That the mind of the Queen, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret artifices of a latent faction, was greatly alienated from the intereſt of her general, and uneaſy at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled power of her treaſurer. They were aſſured, that the influence of the firſt was already in a tottering condition. They ſuppoſed that his prudence would ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to him to provide for the worſt; and, therefore, they derived hopes, from his known love of money, that he would be glad to receive a reward from France, in proportion to his merit in delivering her from the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a war, which threatened her with apparent ruin. The authority of Heinſius was by no means on the ſame precarious footing with that of Marlborough. But the French ſuppoſed that, directing chiefly his attention to the intereſt of his country, he would ſeize with ardour the very advantageous conditions which were to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Lewis the Fourteenth, for extinguiſhing a war, the burden of which lay ſo heavy on the republic<note n="X" place="bottom">M. de Torcy. tom. i.</note>. </p>

                  <note place="margin">But they are deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> The French, however, found themſelves deceived in the hopes which they had formed upon the condition of Marlborough, and the character of Heinſius. Though neither of theſe two great men durſt avowedly ſhew their want of inclination for peace, they were provided with expedients, by breaking off the conferences, to continue the war. The whole buſineſs had been hitherto tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

between Buys and Vander Duſſen, the deputies of the States, on the part of the allies, and the preſident Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illé, in the name of the French King. The terms of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by France were to the laſt degree humiliating to that monarch. But in proportion as the French miniſter augmented his conceſſions, theſe haughty republicans roſe in their demands, in the name of their allies. While affairs were in this unpromiſing condition, the Duke of Marlborough, whoſe opinion of his own ſituation at home agreed not, perhaps, with the hopes the French had formed on that ſubject, put, at once, a ſtop to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. He informed the States, that he had orders to prevent all further advances towards a treaty, ſhould France refuſe to extend her offers in favour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and Great Britain<note n="Y" place="bottom">M. de Torcy, tom. i.</note>.

Marlborough, at the ſame time, had the addreſs to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſincerity of France ſuſpected, by encouraging a belief, that the ſole buſineſs of Rouillé in Holland was to amuſe and deceive the allies<note n="A" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Diſtreſs of France.</note> The ſtate of France, and the conſequent behaviour of her ſovereign, form together irreſiſtible proofs, that the continuation of hoſtilities proceeded more from the views of Marlborough, than from the inſincerity of Lewis the Fourteenth. The dominions of France were afflicted with various and dreadful calamities. A deſperate famine threatened to extend the waſte already made among the inhabitants by the ſword. An exceſſive hard froſt, that had been ſeverely felt throughout Europe, was ſucceeded in France by a ſudden thaw, that deſtroyed all the grain. The ſpring came on, but the weather continued ſevere. Not the leaſt promiſe of maturity was made by the fruits of the earth. Nothing was ſeen within but miſery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and diſtreſs. A powerful enemy hovered on the frontiers, with victorious armies. The complaints of the nation were equal to their misfortunes. Intelligence of the wretched ſtate of the French was carried to the allies; and the report augmented their confidence.

The repeated misfortunes, in preceding cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, ſuggeſted nothing but deſpair concerning the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Every quarter of Europe was filled with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces and misfortunes of France. The confederates, by making themſelves maſters of Liſle, threatened to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the heart of the French dominions. A Prince, who had carried his arms, a few years before, to the banks of the Danube, the Tagus, and the Po, was now forced to examine whether he could remain in ſafety at Verſailles. His people heard already, in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the victors thundering at the gates of Paris. The troops without pay, without clothes, without proviſions, led by generals who had loſt all authority, by repeated errors, and conſequent misfortunes; and an enemy elated by conqueſt, firſt preſcribing terms and then rejecting them, when adopted by the vanquiſhed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Melancholy ſituation of the French court.</note> Neither Lewis nor his ſervants were poſſeſſed of thoſe daring abilities, which ſupply the abſence of force with an indignant pride. When the relation of the laſt confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Rouillé and the deputies of the States was read in council at Verſailles, the French miniſtry reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to puſillanimity and fear. Inſtead of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming courage from deſpair, they yielded to all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy reflections, which misfortunes ſuggeſt to the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid and weak.

He returned to the Hague, on the ſeventh of May, accompanied by the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Townſhend, as ambaſſador extraordinary to the States, and joint-plenipotentiary from Great Britain, for treating concerning the terms of peace. After many fruitleſs conferences, it appeared that the allies were not ſincere in their avowed declarations of wiſhing to put an end to the war. France agreed to yield the whole Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh monarchy to the houſe of Auſtria, without any equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. To cede her conqueſts on the empire, upon the Upper Rhine. To give Furnes, Ypres, Menin, Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay, Liſle, Condé, and Mabeuge for a barrier to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. To acknowledge the Elector of Brandenburgh, as King of Pruſſia; the Duke of Hannover, as ninth elector of the empire. To own the title of Queen Anne to the Britiſh throne.

Though the entire ceſſion of the Spaniſh monarchy, or what was virtually the ſame, the withdrawing all the aid of France from Philip the Fifth, was the whole object of the war, they broke off the conferences, by demanding terms nugatory in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they could not be executed by the French King. The utmoſt that he could promiſe, was to leave the King of Spain to the protection of ſuch as ſhould adhere to that prince of his own ſubjects. But he was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſorm the moſt diſtant hopes of peace, without ſurrendering the ſtrongeſt towns in his dominions, as pledges for the entire evacuation of the Spaniſh domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by his grandſon.

The penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Heinſius framed, at length, forty preliminary arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as the ultimatum of the allies. Though every one of theſe articles contained the dictatorial language uſed by conquerors to the vanquiſhed, the plenipotentiaries of France yielded to thirty-five. The other five were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the deciſion of Lewis the Fourteenth. The Marquis de Torcy repaired for that purpoſe to Paris. But not withſtanding the conſternation of the French King and his council, they had the ſpirit to reject terms of peace, ſcarce leſs ruinous and diſgraceful, than the evils apprehended from a continuance of hoſtilities<note n="G" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The court of France, however, derived ſome advantage from the conferences at the Hague. They found means to remove the deſpair of the people, by raiſing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. They made public the whole negociation. They explained their own enormous conceſſions, and the haughty terms preſcribed, rather than propoſed, by the allies.

The Duke, with a want of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inconſiſtent with his uſual prudence, expreſſed a ſtrong deſire of ſerving effectually <q rend="inline">"the ſon of a King, for whom"</q> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he would have ſpilt the laſt drop of his blood."</q> He told M. de Torcy, at the ſame time, that he believed it was the intereſt of the Prince of Wales, for ſo he called the Pretender, to remove entirely from France. That he ought to fix his reſidence where he pleaſed, enjoy perfect ſecurity, and to be the maſter of his own motions and journies to whatever country he pleaſed. The article of ſubſiſtence was a matter of

greater difficulty. The payment of her dowry to his mother was propoſed by the Marquis de Torcy, as the beſt expedient.

The more important part of the correſpondence, however, lay between the Duke of Marlborough and the Duke of Berwick<note n="L" place="bottom">M. de Torcy.</note>. He made no ſecret to his nephew of his abſolute and fixed reſolution of reſtoring the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded family to the Britiſh throne. His own victories having rendered France incapable, even had ſhe been willing, to aid the cauſe of the Pretender, he had long ſignified his deſire, that that unfortunate Prince ſhould remove from the French dominions. The Duke himſelf and the Earl of Godolphin, who was ſtill more ſincere in his attachment to the exiled branch of the Stuarts, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the greateſt obſtacle to the accompliſhment of their views, proceeded from the unſurmountable aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the people entertained againſt the having a King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them by France.

He knew the Tories, he ſaid, to be paſſionate, unſteady, and unfit for buſineſs. He, therefore, reſolved to bend gradually the Whigs

When he returned from his expedition to the coaſt of Scotland, he attended the Duke of Burgundy in Flanders, and ſerved under that Prince in the preceding campaign. During that period, he ſent repeatedly to Scotland, to announce his fixed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of paſſing, in a hired veſſel, into that kingdom, and to place himſelf in the hands of his friends.

Lewis told him, that though he had all the inclination in the world to ſerve his family, and ultimately himſelf, by forming a diverſion for the arms of the moſt powerful of his enemies, the thing was abſolutely impracticable in the preſent diſtreſſed condition of his affairs. The pretended Prince laid aſide, for the time, all hopes of tranſporting himſelf into Britain. He acquainted his adherents in Scotland, that they had nothing to hope from the court of Verſailles. His ſervants, in the mean time, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to comprehend ſome part of their own intereſt in the negociations then carried on at the Hague.

They earneſtly inſiſted upon a general indemnity to the adherents of the excluded family. They mentioned, on various foundations, the dowry ſtill owing to Queen Mary d'Eſtè, the Pretender's mother.

                  <note place="margin">Campaign of 1709.</note> The breaking up of the conferences for the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of peace, was immediately followed by vigorous preparations for carrying on the war. The Duke of Marlborough left the Hague, on the ninth of June, to place himſelf at the head of the conſederate army in Flanders. The Prince of Savoy had abſolutely refuſed to go to Spain. Nothing to be done in Italy ſeemed worthy of his preſence. The army on the Rhine had been formed with difficulty, and its motions were ſlow. He, therefore, reſolved to remain in Flanders, and to ſecond the Duke of Marlborough in thoſe great deſigns, which had probably fruſtrated the concluſion of an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and highly advantageous peace. The army was in
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:0709200302:403"/>
a condition ſuitable to the magnitude of the concerted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes. The troops, that had gained ſo much glory and ſuffered ſo great loſſes, in the preceding campaign, had been early recruited. The freſh reinforcements, conſiſting of ſome Britiſh regiments, and eight thouſand Saxons, which the Duke of Marlborough had negociated with King Auguſtus, had augmented the army of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in Flanders, to one hundred and ten thouſand combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants<note n="Q" place="bottom">Life of Marlborough, vol. ii. Hiſt. de'Angleterre, tom. iii.</note>. The wretched ſtate, into which a ſevere winter had reduced France, had facilitated the recruiting of her forces. Thoſe who could procure no bread at home, were forced, for mere ſuſtenance, to inliſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſoldiers. The army oppoſed to the allies in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was commanded by the Mareſchal de Villars. Though inferior in number to the enemy, the troops derived a kind of ſpirit, from their very deſpair<note n="R" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France. tom. iii.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The allies unable to force the enemy to a battle.</note> In the end of June, Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough formed their army, on the plains of Liſle. The number of their troops, their confidence in their own conduct, the conſternation of the French, and their promiſes to the allies to diſperſe the army of the enemy, and to penetrate into the heart of France, rendered thoſe able generals extremely anxious to bring matters, by a battle, to a deciſion. The Mareſchal de Villars had occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied a ſtrong poſt, between Couriere and the town of Bethune, which covered both his wings. He was defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in front, by the villages of la Baſſée and Pont-Avendin. He covered, by this poſition of his army, the cities of Doway and Arras, the taking of which would have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wide paſſage to the allies in the heart of France. The generals of the confederates having advanced within two leagues of the enemy, rode out on the twenty-fourth of June to view their ſituation. Finding it too ſtrong to venture a battle, they decamped in the night, and ſat ſuddenly down before Tournay<note n="S" place="bottom">Kane's Memoirs. Life of Marlborough.</note>. Villars, afraid of being attacked in his camp, had injudiciouſly weakened the garriſon of Tournay to five thouſand men; and it was the intelligence received by the allies concerning this

It had been from time immemorial ſubject to France, till it fell into the hands of Henry the Eighth, King of England, in the year 1513. It was, however, ſoon after reſtored, through the intrigues and influence of Cardinal Wolſey. The Spaniards took Tournay in the year 1618. But having been retaken by Lewis the Fourteenth, in the year 1667, it was rendered, by new fortifications, one of the ſtrongeſt places in the Netherlands. The ſituation of the town is extremely advantageous for defence. No commanding heights are near; and it is ſo well covered on every ſide, that an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my muſt be in poſſeſſion of the covered way, to batter in breach. The Scheld, which divides the town, muſt naturally divide the enemy; a circumſtance often incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and always dangerous. The citadel, fortified with all the ſkill of Vauban, was ſtill more ſtrong than the town. The place, however, was ſo well attacked, or ſo ill defended, that it fell into the hands of the allies, after one and twenty days open trenches. The governor entered the citadel, with the remains of his garriſon, on the thirtieth of July.

The Prince of Heſſe having being ordered, with a ſtrong detachment, to diſlodge a party of the enemy, poſted in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of that city, was ſoon after followed by the whole army. Villars, having formed the reſolution of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or relieving the place, paſſed the Scarpe, and encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between that river and the Scheld. Finding himſelf diſappointed in his hopes of arriving before the main army of the allies at Mons, he ſtopt ſhort at Malplaquet, a village ſcarce a league diſtant from that city. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched himſelf in that ſtrong ſituation, and prepared to give all the diſturbance poſſible to the beſiegers. His right extended to the village of Malplaquet, which lay behind the extenſive and impenetrable wood of Sart. His

left was covered with another deep wood. Along a very narrow plain, oppoſed to his centre, he drew trenches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind trenches, and covered the whole with a row of trees, with all their branches, which he had cut down and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the neighbouring woods. The generals of the confederates, reſolving to diſlodge the French from their ſtrong poſt, viewed their ſituation, on the tenth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, and fixed upon the next day for the execution of their plan<note n="V" place="bottom">Mem. de Fenquiere.

                  <note place="margin">Battle of Malplaquet,</note> Scarce had day-light appeared, when the two armies, having prepared themſelves in the night for action, were ſeen ranged in complete order of battle. The allies had reſolved to attack, at once, the whole line of the enemy. The Britiſh troops were oppoſed to the left, the Dutch to the right, and the Germans to the center of the French. The Mareſchal de Villars placed himſelf at the head of his left wing. He committed the charge of the right to the Mareſchal de Boufflers, who, though his ſenior, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to act a ſecond part. After an awful ſuſpence and ſilence for near two hours, the battle began at eight of the clock. In a moment the firing extended from wing to wing. Few ages ever produced ſo long, ſo obſtinate, ſo bloody a battle. The allies were rouſed by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer victories. The French, were become, in a manner, furious, through deſpair. The Duke of Argyle, with the left of the Britiſh troops, paſſing through a moraſs, deemed impracticable, charged, with fury, the enemy ſtationed in the wood, in his front, and drove them into the plain behind, where they inſtantly formed. This circumſtance contributed greatly to the ſucceſs of the allies. Villars, as had been foreſeen, weakened his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſupport his left wing againſt the fierce aſſault of the Britiſh infantry. The French ſuſtained, with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon firmneſs, all the efforts of their enemies, in the plain. They even drove them back into the wood from which they themſelves had been driven. The carnage was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe.

in three lines, to the entrenchments, they made and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a terrible fire, for the ſpace of an hour. Some battalions giving way before them, were brought back and confirmed in their ſtation, by the vigilance, courage, and activity of the Mareſchal de Boufflers. The Dutch, in their turn, gave ground a little way. Some French battalions, emboldened by their own reſiſtance, ruſhed from their entrenchments, puſhed the enemy from one of their batteries, ſeized their colours, and regaining their poſt, ſuſtained a ſecond charge. The unexpected obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the French, in both wings, induced the generals of the confederates to entertain thoughts of deſiſting from the attack. General Cadogan, in that inſtant, perceived the void left in the centre of the enemy, by the troops called by Villars to ſupport his left. Prince Eugene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to attack, in perſon, the intrenchments in that place. He led ſome freſh battalions to the charge. He entered the line of the enemy. He flanked a regiment of French guards, and forced them to fly. Villars, haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to ſupport his centre, was wounded and carried from the field. The Mareſchal de Boufflers, notwithſtanding, ſuſtained the fight with obſtinacy. The cavalry of the allies had already entered his lines. He ordered the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier de St. George, who ſerved in this campaign, to advance at the head of twelve hundred of the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards. In one deſperate ſhock the German horſe were broken and diſſipated. But the two generals of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who, on that occaſion, joined the valour of ſoldiers to the conduct of great captains, rallied their cavalry, forced the enemy back on their lines, and advancing ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but firmly, under the fire of thirty pieces of cannon, ſhowed, by their ſteady motions, that they were reſolved to gain the field<note n="X" place="bottom">M. de Feuquiere.

The enemy were in no condition to preſs upon his rear. They comented themſelves with the field of battle, now cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

with near forty thouſand men, comprehending the wounded and the ſlain. This battle was one of the moſt bloody, and, perhaps, the moſt ſingular, that had been fought for ſeveral ages. The trophies were few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and they were reciprocal. The generals and officers, on both ſides, acted their reſpective parts with diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conduct; and all their efforts were ſupported by the troops with conſummate courage. Though the field of battle remained in the poſſeſſion of the allies, the French obtained an honour almoſt equal to that of victory, by a ſteady, regular, judicious, and ſafe retreat. The loſs of the confederates, in this bloody action, amounted to twenty thouſand men. The French left more than eight thouſand dead on the field. Though the abilities of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated themſelves with honour from this hazardous attack, men could ſcarce forgive their raſhneſs in throwing away the lives of thouſands, without any neceſſity. Mons might have been taken without a battle. The confederates, at leaſt, might have had the choice of their own ground<note n="Y" place="bottom">Kane's Memoirs. M. de Feuquiere.</note>.

The Elector executed his part of the plan, as far as he was permitted by the wretched ſtate of the forces under his command. The Duke of Savoy, diſpleaſed with the Emperor, became careleſs concerning the fate of the war. The Elector, in proſecution of his part of the ſcheme, detached Count Merci, with a ſtrong body of troops, into the Upper Alſace. But on the twenty-ſixth of Auguſt, that general was totally defeated by the Count de Bourg, and forced, with the ſhattered remains of his forces, to repaſs the Rhine. The defeat of Merci

The Duke refuſed to take the field in perſon. His troops remained upon the defenſive; and the French were too feeble to make any attack of importance. In Spain, the principal and firſt object of conteſt, the war, as uſual, was neglected by the confederates. The French King, either with a view to peace, or on account of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted ſtate of his own kingdom, had withdrawn his troops from Spain; and devolved on his grandſon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own dominions. That Prince, thus left to his own reſources, obtained conſiderable advantages over Charles the Third, and the Portugueze. The Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier d'Alsfeldt took the caſtle of Alicant, on the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of April. The Earl of Galway was totally defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Marquis de Bay, on the ſeventh of May, in the province of Eſtramadura. The Duke de Noailles, who commanded in Catalonia, obtained ſome advantages over the allies. But the Count Staremberg, who led the forces of Charles the Third in that kingdom, having endeavoured, in vain, to force the Mareſchal de Bezons to a battle, took Balaguier, in his preſence, and, with that ſucceſs, put an end to the campaign<note n="A" place="bottom">Publications of the Times.</note>.</p>

Theſe diſadvantages, though trivial in themſelves, raiſed ſome murmurs among the people.

The aſtoniſhing good fortune which had ſo long attended the King of Sweden, began to deſert his arms in the end of the preceding campaign. But his affairs were not completely ruined till the fatal battle of Pultowa, which was fought on the eleventh of July. Having reſolved to carry the war againſt the Czar into the heart of Ruſſia, and encouraged by the defection of the Coſſacks, he precipitately entered the Ukrain. His communication with Poland being cut off, he was reduced to the greateſt diſtreſs for want of military ſtores and proviſions. To ſupply himſelf at the expence of his enemies he ſat down before Pultowa, which was full of magazines of every kind. The Czar marched to relieve the place. The King of Sweden abandoned at once his own fate to the deciſion of a battle. He himſelf had taught the Ruſſians to conquer. His whole army was either deſtroyed in the action, or forced, ſoon after, to ſurrender at diſcretion. He croſſed the Boriſthenes, with three hundred of his guards. He gained Oczakow. He retired to Bender. His whole party fell with his change of fortune. King Auguſtus re-entered Poland. He was followed by the Czar.

The French, though their intrigues had not hitherto prevailed upon Charles to eſpouſe their cauſe, derived ſome faint hopes from his indignation againſt the Emperor's open breach of the treaty of Alt-Ranſtadt, which the former had, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, extorted from the court of Vienna, by the terror of his arms.

Though the ſucceſs of the allies had not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their own expectations, the ſame difficulties which had fruſtrated the deſign of the former conferences continued.

The Tories, who had been long borne down by the ſplendid meaſures of Marlborough and Godolphin, began again to rear their heads and to rail at their conduct. Their retainers carried to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit and preſs, ſuch accuſations of their opponents as ſuited their own views. Though many circumſtances were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated, there was certainly much ground for complaint. A want of attention to the intereſts of the nation, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating its hopes of peace, upon terms honourable to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and profitable to the reſt of the allies, a neglect of the war in Spain, an excluſive attention to that in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the inactivity of the fleet, the decay of trade, for want of protection from the private armed veſſels of the enemy, were all brought to the great account, with which the miniſtry were charged, with ſome colour of juſtice. To theſe accuſations they added others, more to alarm the prejudices of the weak, than convince the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part of the nation. The cry, that the church was in danger, was renewed in all its force; and this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

The ſucceſs of the campaign in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, had flattered the people into a kind of forgetfulneſs of their own complaints. They were again reconciled to a war, from which the kingdom derived ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown. On the fifteenth of November, the parliament met at Weſtminſter. The Queen, who, on account of the death of her huſband, had not made her appearance in the preceding ſeaſon, opened the preſent ſeſſion, in perſon. The ſpeeches of Princes are the echoes of the voice of their principal ſervants. The Queen expreſſed the uſual ſentiments concerning the war, and demanded the uſual ſupplies. She complained that France had made uſe of all her artifices to amuſe the allies, with falſe appearances and deceitful inſinuations of her deſire of peace<note n="H" place="bottom">Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Nov. 15.</note>. Though the contrary was certainly the fact, the aſſertion was neceſſary to juſtify the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the war. The commons, with great unanimity and zeal, proceeded on the ſupplies. More than ſix mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions were demanded and granted.

A brief detail of facts, will throw ſufficient light on a ſubject rendered tedious and perplexed, by the zeal of contending parties. Henry Sacheverell, who kindled this new flame between the Whigs and Tories, was a clergyman, neither eminent in his character, nor obſcure in his profeſſion; vehement by nature, a warm zealot from principle, attached to the moſt extravagant doctrines of the high-church, a determined enemy to diſſenters, to occaſional conformiſts, and their abettors the whole party of the Whigs. Having diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the country by his zeal, and even by his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he was called, by a popular election, to a church in Southwark. Having a more extenſive field for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating his doctrines, he became ſoon to be generally known and followed, by thoſe who favoured moſt the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0709200302:413"/>
principles of the high-church. On the fifth of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the preſent year, the anniverſary of the gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot, having obtained the pulpit at St. Paul's, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered a ſermon, before the lord mayor and the court of aldermen, full of thoſe expreſſions of complaint and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, which were common to him with his whole party. In this diſcourſe, he inveighed with paſſion, if not with indecency, againſt the diſſenters, and the moderate part of the church of England; and, at the ſame time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed ſevere ſtrictures upon thoſe in power. He incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated alſo, in ſtrong and vehement terms, the doctrine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance, which, in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt latitude, was inconſiſtent with the late revolution<note n="J" place="bottom">Journals, Dec. 13.</note>.</p>

The lord mayor was of the oppoſite party. He encouraged the Doctor, not only to publiſh the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but to preſent it to him, in a dedication conceived in the ſame vehement ſtrain with the ſermon. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was compoſed of ſuch combuſtible materials, that the leaſt ſpark was ſufficient to kindle the whole into a flame. The conteſts between leaders, for places of truſt, profit, and power, had been improved into a ſettled principle; among their reſpective adherents. The two parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the hope of conviction, had been long perſuaded, that their antagoniſts were determined to run into the moſt dreadful extremities, and to ruin the nation. The Tories believed, that the Whigs intended to eſtabliſh a republican ſyſtem of civil government, and to deſtroy the church. The Whigs were convinced, that the Tories were reſolved to perſecute the diſſenters, and to place the Pretender on the throne. The reception given to the ſermon, and to the opinions formed of the Doctor, were ſuitable to the extravagant paſſions of the two parties. The Tories extolled him as a perſon, who ſtood alone unſubdued in deſence of the church, now on the brink of ruin. The Whigs gave him the name of a popiſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, an enemy to the revolution, a devoted friend to the Pretender. The vehemence of both excited to ſuch a pitch the curioſity of the whole people, that forty thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand

                  <note place="margin">He is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached.</note> The miniſtry, in an evil hour for their own power, ſuffered their paſſions, on this occaſion, to overcome their prudence. The Earl of Godolphin, in particular, who was perſonally attacked in the ſermon, was extremely irritated againſt the preacher. The leaders of the Whigs, in general, ſhewed great eagerneſs to puniſh ſeverely the man who attacked, with ſuch boldneſs, thoſe principles which they had held forth ſo long to the world. The crown lawyers were conſulted. They declared, that the offence was not puniſhable by common law. The more moderate part of the miniſtry propoſed, that the ſermon ſhould be only burned, by the order of both houſes, and the author confined during the ſeſſion. The moſt violent declared, that a more ſolemn puniſhment was neceſſary, to ſtigmatiſe a crime of ſuch dangerous tendency. They propoſed, therefore, an impeachment, as the moſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied mode of proceeding againſt a man, in whoſe perſon they reſolved to puniſh his whole party. Complaint of the ſermon was accordingly made in the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons<note n="L" place="bottom">Dec. 13, 1703.</note>. Sacheverell was ordered to attend, on the fourteenth of December. He was taken into cuſtody, and inſtantly impeached. The high-church party flew into the moſt violent reſentment. The whole people were rouſed to attention. Many were alarmed. The emiſſaries of the two parties ſpread the flame with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful zeal. They neglected their private concerns. The buſineſs of the public was neglected.

Sacheverell was principally defended by his council, by ſhewing that his expreſſions, without being wreſted from their true meaning, could not be applied to the crimes of which he was accuſed. When the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel had ended the defence, Sacheverell himſelf concluded, with reading a ſpeech, in which he juſtified his doctrines with ſome energy and a great deal of heat, expreſſing his approbation of the revolution, and his reſpect for the reigning Queen and her government<note n="N" place="bottom">Printed ſpeech.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Debates of the lords.</note> When the accuſation and defence were ended, the lords entered into warm debates. The arguments, on both ſides, partook more of the nice diſtinctions of the ſchools, than of that manly and deciſive reaſoning, more to be wiſhed for than expected among great bodies of men. None defended abſolutely the doctrine of non-reſiſtance. But ſeveral, though they avowed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the late Revolution, affirmed, that thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined it leaſt were its beſt friends. A biſhop ſaid, that a veil ought to be thrown over that tranſaction. That men ſhould rather call it a vacancy and an abdication, than receive its benefits, as the conſequence of reſiſtance. The Duke of Leeds improved on theſe puerile refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in a very long and laboured ſpeech. He owned, that he had a great ſhare in the Revolution; but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought, he ſaid, that things would have been driven ſo far, as to ſettle the crown on the Prince of Orange. He affirmed, that the Prince had often told him, that he himſelf had no ſuch thoughts. That a diſtinction ought to be made between reſiſtance and revolution. That va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy or abdication was the ſubject of the debates of the convention; and that reſiſtance, a word both dangerous and odious, ought for ever to be forgot. He obſerved, with peculiar ſagacity, that had not the attempt ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would have certainly been rebellion; and that, for his part, he knew no other but hereditary right<note n="O" place="bottom">Parl. debates.

cenſure ſhould be paſſed on Sacheverell. Thoſe who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued moſt againſt his doctrines, ſeemed leaſt inclined to be ſevere. The populace were already inflamed to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fury. Many dreaded perſonal inſults. Some were afraid of commotions, which the enemies of the kingdom might improve to their own advantage. A few, who thought they had gone too far, from a prudent regard to their own intereſt, began dexterouſly to fall down with the tide. The ſentence, therefore, which was paſſed, if not unequal to the guilt of Sacheverell, was certainly unſuitable to the dignity of his accuſers and the ſolemnity of his trial. He was ſuſpended, for three years, from preaching, and his ſermon was ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. The famous decree of the univerſity of Oxford, paſſed upon occaſion of the Rye-houſe plot, in the year 1683, was alſo burned by a vote of the lords. This decree, in an uncommon ſtrain of ſervility, recognized the doctrine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance in the moſt unlimited ſenſe of the words, owned the abſolute and indefeaſible rights of Kings, and the unalterableneſs of the hereditary ſucceſſion to the crown<note n="P" place="bottom">Printed Decree.</note>.</p>

The opening made by Pettekum, the envoy of Holſtein, in the end of the year, induced the court of Verſailles to offer the ſending plenipotentiaries, to any part in Holland or Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the States General ſhould appoint, to enter into immediate negociations of peace. They propoſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the preliminaries ſigned by the allies, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding year, to reduce their own conceſſions into a more comprehenſive, but an equally ample form.

To the States he promiſed to yield the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier ſpecified, in their own preliminaries, to confirm his former offers, with regard to their trade.

Theſe miniſters arrived at Moerdyke on the ninth of March. After va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conferences with Buys and Vander Duſſen, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the States, they opened, on the twentieth of the month, a ſerious negociation of peace at Gertruyden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg. During repeated conferences, with the interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeveral expreſſes, ſent by the plenipotentiaries to Verſailles for further powers, the French departed from almoſt all the reſervation they had made, in the prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries ſent in the beginning of the year to Holland.

They relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed even Alſace to the Emperor; and, as a ſecurity for the performance of the articles of the treaty, engaged to deliver the fortified towns of French Flanders, into the hands of the allies.

Men who profited fo much by the war, were not likely to facilitate the concluſion of peace. Their influence with Heinſius, who had eſtabliſhed a kind of unlimited power over the councils of the States, facilitated the completion of their views. Safe in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in whom they had reaſon to place an unbounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, they contrived to induce the Emperor and the Queen of Great Britain to throw the whole negociation into the hands of the republic. The characters of the Dutch deputies, who managed the conferences at Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truydenberg, were more calculated to embarraſs any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, than to bring it to a happy concluſion.

                  <note place="margin">Operations in Spain, battle of Almenara.</note> The campaign in Spain was rendered memorable, by the alternate defeats of the two pretenders to the throne of that kingdom. Philip the Fifth, with an army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting entirely of Spaniards, took the field in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of May. Having paſſed the Segra, he ſat down, on the fifteenth of the month, before Balaguer, and raiſed batteries againſt the place. But upon the approach of Count Staremberg, he repaſſed the river, and retired to Lerida, where he waited for a reinforcement of troops, from every ſide. King Charles having, in the mean time, reſolved to meet his rival in the field, joined the army near Balaguer, in the beginning of June. Philip, willing to bring the conteſt to a deciſion, paſſed, a ſecond time, the Segra. The two armies directing their route to Almenara, came to a battle, in the neighbourhood of that place<note n="X" place="bottom">July 27.</note>.

                  <note place="margin">Battle of Sarragoſſa.</note> The rout at Almenara was but a prelude to a greater misfortune, which ſoon after fell on the arms of Philip the fifth. That Prince, to cut off the communication between the enemy and Caſtile, paſſed the Cinca and marched toward Sarragoſſa. On the eighteenth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, he fixed his camp within a league of that city. The count de Staremberg, one of the moſt able generals of the age, commanded the allies. The Marquis de Bay, being recalled by Philip from the province of Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramadura, was placed at the head of the Spaniards. The firſt ſought earneſtly after an opportunity of giving battle. The latter avoided it in vain. The Spaniards were again routed, with the loſs of three thouſand men. They, however, found means to ſave their artillery and baggage, though they retired in great diſorder to Tudela. The Britiſh troops, under general Stanhope, bore the chief ſhare in a victory, which threatened to decide the fate of Spain. The victors marched ſtreight to Madrid. Philip quitted, a ſecond time, the capital to his rival, and retired to Valladolid. The religious enthuſiaſm of the Spaniards, together with a rooted averſion to the houſe of Auſtria, under whoſe feeble tyranny they had languiſhed for near two centuries, was of greater benefit to Philip than their arms. They conſidered Charles the Third as a King impoſed upon them by Heretics; and their attachment to his rival roſe in proportion to his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes<note n="Z" place="bottom">Hiſt. d'Eſpagne, tom. ii. &amp;c.</note>. General Stanhope, who had poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of Madrid, was better calculated to defeat an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than to gain the affections of the vanquiſhed. The army lived at large upon the people, without order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moderation, and without diſcipline. They raiſed contributions on private perſons. They pillaged the churches, and ſold publickly the utenſils of the altar. The ravages of the allies combining with the obſtinacy of the Spaniards, created ſuch a dearth of proviſions in Caſtille, that ſeventeen thouſand men, the number of which the victors conſiſted, found themſelves incapable of ſubſiſting in the kingdom<note n="A" place="bottom">Hiſt. d'Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre.</note>.</p>

houſe of Bourbon. On the other hand, the Duke de Vendome, whom the caprice of the Duke of Burgundy had rendered uſeleſs to France, aſſumed, at the requeſt of Philip, the chief command in Spain. The nobility crowded from every ſide, with their followers, round the ſtandard of a general in whoſe conduct they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide. To theſe were joined thirty-five battalions of French foot, with twenty-eight ſquadrons of horſe, detached from Dauphiné by the Duke of Berwick. The army under Vendôme, before the end of October, amounted to thirty thouſand men. Another army of French, under the Duke de Noailles, aſſembled in Rouſſillon, were prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enter Catalonia. Theſe efforts on the ſide of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, were ſeconded by diſſentions among the allies. The latter retreated, in a kind of confuſion, toward Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, whither Charles had already retired. They divided themſelves, for the benefit of ſubſiſtence, into two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Staremberg commanded the moſt numerous, and marched in front. Stanhope, with five thouſand Britiſh troops, brought up the rear. The latter ſtopt, on the eighth of December, at a ſmall unfortified town called Briheuga. He was ignorant that hope gives wings to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as well as fear. The Duke de Vendôme had ſwam acroſs the Tagus with all his cavalry. He was juſt at the heels of Stanhope, when that general had the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſhut himſelf up in full ſecurity in the village of Briheuga.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his leſt was broken and routed, he maintained the fight with a ſingle battalion, in the midſt of which he had placed himſelf. Night, at length, more than the efforts of the enemy, forced him to make his retreat. The field of battle, with twenty pieces of cannon, two mortars, and ſome waggons of proviſions and ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, remained to Vendôme. Three thouſand of the allies were ſlain in the action, and as many were taken in and near the field. But it was rather a retreat than a flight. Staremberg had his trophies as well as Vendôme. The honours of victory were even diſputed by the former. But the progreſs of the Spaniards, after the action, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained that their claims were better ſounded. The Duke de Noailles made a conſiderable progreſs in Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia. The efforts of the Marquis de Bay were attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome ſucceſs in Eſtramadura. He prevented the junction of the Portugueze with the Count de Starem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, and extended his ravages and contributions into the very heart of the kingdom of Portugal<note n="C" place="bottom">Hiſt. de Portugal, d'Angleterre, et d'Eſpagne.</note>.</p>

Their chief employment, during the ſummer, was the tranſporting of feeble ſuccours to Catalonia and Portugal. To weaken, by making a diverſion on the coaſt of France, the reinforcements deſtined to march from that kingdom to Spain, a deſcent was made upon the coaſt of Languedoc. On the twentieth of July, the confederate fleet, under Sir John Norris and the Dutch admiral Somelſdyke, ſailed from Barcelona.

The Duke de Noailles, having, upon the alarm of the deſcent, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed haſtily from Rouſſillon, with two thouſand dragoons, having each a foot-ſoldier behind, the enemy thought proper to quit their conqueſts and to re-imbark their troops. The French court, in the mean time, incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of fitting out a fleet, permitted almoſt all their great ſhips to lie idle, under the protection of the forts which deſended their harbours.

The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Godolphin, having defeated, ſome years before, the intrigues of Harley in the cabinet, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to hold, by the means of party, the power which they deſpaired to poſſeſs by the inclination of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. As long as they retained the affections of the Queen, the confidence which their ſplendid meaſures had acquired from the people, were ſufficient to ſupport them againſt the irregular attacks of the two irreconcileable parties, that had harraſſed the nation for ſuch a number of years, with their conteſts and their noiſe. But when the violence of the Dutcheſs of Marlborough had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that influence, which ſhe had extended into a kind of tyranny over the timid mind of her miſtreſs, they found it neceſſary to ſtrengthen themſelves, by forming a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the Whigs. They gained, therefore, the leaders of that party, by admitting them into places of truſt and profit; and, fortified, by this political alliance, they held their ſovereign in chains.

The influence of his ſiſter, more, perhaps, than his merit, had recommended Hill to the attention of the Queen; and ſhe ſhewed an inclination to raiſe him to the command of a regiment of dragoons, vacant by the death of the Earl of Eſſex.

On the eighth of Auguſt the Earl of Godolphin received a meſſage from the Queen, to break his ſtaff as lord-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of Great Britain. The treaſury was immediately put in commiſſion. The Earl Powlet was conſtituted the chief at the board; but the ſecret of affairs was known to lie in the hands of Robert Harley, made chancellor of the Exchequer. This change in the treaſury was the forerunner of alterations in the other departments of the ſtate.

To be connected with a party was neceſſary, in a country where preferment was gained, like victories, by the force of numbers.

In the management of mobs, in the tumults of elections, in reconciling the inconſiderate and ſanguine to his views, by baits of profligate pleaſures, the Earl of Wharton had no equal. In his exhibitions in the houſe of lords, he poſſeſſed a ready, rather than ſolid eloquence. His imagination was quick, his ſatire poignant, his wit fertile, but coarſe.

Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical timidity was the greateſt defect of his mind. That paſſion overcame frequently, in his public tranſactions, that ſincerity which he uniformly obſerved in his private conduct. The weakneſs which induced him to adhere, in his opinions, to the excluded branch of the houſe of Stuart, was a kind of virtue.

In their approbation, as well as in their cenſures, on the ſubject, the parliament appear to have yielded, in ſome degree, to the ſpirit of party.

A kind of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was ready to be formed againſt his meaſures, when an accident, which threatened to be fatal, raiſed him beyond the reach of the enemies of his power. The Abbé de la Bourlie, a Frenchman, who had aſſumed the title of Marquis de Guiſcard, had made his eſcape from his own country, for ſome crime, which merited the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate animadverſion of the law.

The profeſſed deſign of this needy adventurer was to reſtore his country to her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient liberty. To contribute to the execution of his purpoſe, he was placed on board the Eugliſh fleet, in the year 1706, when a deſcent, under the Earl of Rivers, was intended to be made on the coaſt of France. This aſſertor of the cauſe of freedom was, however, found to be ſuch a tyrant in command, that Sir Cloudeſly Shovel thought it neceſſary to ſet him on ſhore before the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was laid aſide<note n="S" place="bottom">Publications of the Times.</note>.</p>

He long ſolicited a ſettled penſion in vain. His profligacy having recommended him to Mr. Henry St. John, they lived together, for ſome time, in mutual confidence and a community of pleaſures. A diſpute about a miſtreſs, or rather concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a child, which neither choſe to own, had interrupted their intimacy, before St. John had been advanced, through the fall of the Whig-miniſtry, to the office of ſecretary of ſtate. The latter, therefore, was hardly prevailed upon, by his French friend, to recommend him as an object worthy of the generoſity of the crown. He, however, mentioned the caſe of Guiſcard; and five hundred pounds a year was ordered for him, by the Queen. Harley, not only reduced the penſion to four hundred pounds, but even declined to place it on any fixed eſtabliſhment. The pretended Marquis endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obtain redreſs from the Queen. But all acceſs to her perſon was denied. Reduced to diſtreſs, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligacy, and offended at men who had been once his friends, he endeavoured to reconcile himſelf to his own country, by betraying to the court of France the counſels of the Britiſh miniſtry. He entered into correſpondence with one Morreau, a banker at Paris. To cover his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he ſent his letters to Portugal, incloſed to the Earl of Portmore, who commanded the Britiſh troops in that kingdom. The Earl ſuſpecting ſome treachery, opened

Ignorant of the laws of the country, and conſcious of his own crime, he thought he could not eſcape a death of ignominy. He fell into a fit of deſpair. In the midſt of his diſorder, he was carried to the cock-pit, before a committee of the council.

They knew, that France, encouraged by the death of the Emperor, would recede from the terms offered to their predeceſſors; and they were no ſtrangers to the advantage which their enemies would derive from ſuch a circumſtance. They began, therefore, to feel the ground as they went, with great caution and addreſs. The Queen, in an extraordinary meſſage, informed her parliament of the death of the Emperor, and of her own reſolution to make the election fall upon his brother, the King of Spain. She told, at the ſame time, to the two houſes, that ſhe hoped to be ſoon in a condition to put a happy end to the war, by a laſting and honourable peace<note n="K" place="bottom">Journals, April 20.</note>.</p>

The intereſt of both was another name for the common cauſe. This was the great chain, which kept together the confederacy; and not the preſervation of the balance or the liberties of Europe.

But the death of the Emperor, while it haſtened the approach of peace, obſtructed the operations of war. A well-grounded fear, that the French and the partiſans of the Electors of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia and Cologn, might endeavour to diſturb the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a new Emperor, obliged the Prince of Savoy to march, with the greateſt part of the German troops, to the banks of the Rhine. The Mareſchal de Villars, ſtrongly poſted behind his lines at Arleux, diſappointed all the efforts of Marlborough, for bringing things to the deciſion of a battle. The Duke, on bad terms with the miniſtry, foreſaw his own diſgrace was near. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſhed earneſtly, either to overwhelm his political enemies with the ſplendour of a great victory, or at leaſt to retire, under the ſhelter of an action of renown. The ſtrong poſition of the French, the reſolution of their general, not to abandon the fate of the kingdom to the event of a battle, deprived the Duke of the opportunity which he ſo much deſired. Having poſſeſſed himſelf of Arleux, a place conſiderable only from its commanding the Scarpe, he was driven from thence by the enemy. But he ſat down before Bouchain, in ſight of the enemy; and took that important place, on the thirteenth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. The armies remained in the field, till the month of October; when the Duke cloſed, at once, his own military exploits and the campaign.</p>

on every ſide of the war. Both parties, fatigued with fruitleſs hoſtilities, ſeemed willing to transfer their conteſts from the field to the cabinet. As the death of one Prince of the houſe of Auſtria had rouſed all Europe to arms, ſo the demiſe of another was deſtined to reſtore it to peace. On the firſt of October, Charles the Third, King of Spain, was choſen Emperor by the unanimous conſent of all the electors. The wretched ſituation of France prevented her from making the leaſt effort againſt the elevationof her greateſt enemy. But, had ſhe even had the power, ſhe ought not to have the inclination to fruſtrate the election. The Imperial crown ſeemed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to exclude the new Emperor from that of Spain. The great motive of the war was removed, from all the confederates. It was not the intereſt of the German Princes to place in the hands of their maſter the power of oppreſſing themſelves. It was not to be ſuppoſed, that either Britain or the States, after having expended their blood and treaſure, in breaking the power of one family, would raiſe that of another on its ruins.</p>

His propoſals were received with an eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuitable to the diſtreſſes of France. But the ſervants of Lewis the Fourteenth, juſtly judging, that they had more to hope from the facility of the Britiſh miniſtry, than from the haughty obſtinacy of the States, returned a prudent anſwer.

The ſtrong places taken from the Duke of Savoy were to be reſtored, and that Prince was to be permitted to poſſeſs himſelf of ſuch towns and diſtricts in Italy, as were particularly mentioned in the treaties between him and the allies<note n="T" place="bottom">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.

That France ſhould either reſtore or cede the iſland of New foundland and Hudſon's Bay and Streights. Theſe articles were, by particular deſire, to remain a profound ſecret, not to be revealed but by the mutual conſent of the contracting parties.

He was only to communicate theſe preliminary demands to the French miniſtry, and to bring back their anſwer. He inſiſted, therefore, on a poſitive anſwer, in writing, containing an abſolute conſent or a downright refuſal. To grant either, was deemed equally dangerous, by France. A conſent would ruin the trade of that kingdom. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal might break off the negociation, and involve the houſe of Bourbon in all the miſeries of a war which had already been unfortunate, beyond the example of former times. To avoid thoſe inconveniences, the French King propoſed to transfer the negociations to London.

When Prior paſſed clandeſtinely from Dover to Calais, Mackay wrote to Mr. Secretary St. John, that an Engliſh gentleman had taken his paſſage to France. St. John, to conceal the affair from the public, deſired Mackay to keep the thing a ſecret, and to watch the man's return.</p>

That officious ſervant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his people, between the Forelands, to watch the return of Prior. He at length had advice that a veſſel had landed at Deal, three perſons with Secretary St. John's paſs. He made haſte to Canterbury, and met there his old acquaintance, Matthew Prior, under a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed name. Mackay diſpatched immediately an expreſs to the Duke of Marlborough, then beſieging Bouchain, with this important intelligence. He informed alſo the Earl of Sunderland of what he had heard and ſeen; and that nobleman communicated to the Imperial and Dutch ambaſſadors, his fixed opinion, that negociations of peace were begun. Marlborough ſent a copy of Mackay's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Secretary St. John. The informer was diſmiſſed from office. But the miſchief was already done. The Imperial miniſter expoſtulated with the miniſtry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſecret negociations which were ſuſpected to ſubſiſt between Great Britain and France. He was told, by way of anſwer, that he had no reaſon to be alarmed. That the Queen was reſolved never to hearken to any terms of peace that might derogate from her engagements with her allies. The intercourſe between the two court being no longer a ſecret, the ſubſtance of the projected treaty of peace was carried to the preſs by the oppoſing party, and eagerly defended by the friends of the miniſtry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

To reconcile the nation to the ceſſion of Spain to the houſe of Bourbon, they affirmed, that the dependence of Philip the Fifth on French councils, would certainly ceaſe at the death of his grandfather, an event not far diſtant, conſidering the great age of that Prince; and they cloſed their arguments with obſerving, that the total ceſſion of the Spaniſh monarchy to the houſe of Auſtria, was now a thing impracticable, as that monarchy was actually diſmembered, by the ceſſions made to the Duke Savoy, and the conqueſts of the Britiſh and Dutch nations<note n="Y" place="bottom">Political Pamphlets, 1711.</note>.</p>

But though the ſervants of the crown obſerved ſuch caution in the negociation, they ſeemed determined to ſupport the preliminary articles. On the ninth of October, a copy was delivered to the Imperial ambaſſador, Count Galas.

But neither Oxford nor his aſſociates were now to be intimidated, from the proſecution of their pacific deſigns. To teſtify at once to the world their reſolution to adhere to the preliminaries offered by France, they ordered the Imperial miniſter to come no more to court, and to make preparations for quitting the kingdom. The precipitate vehemence of that miniſter rendered, in ſome meaſure, neceſſary a proceeding which was as unuſual as it was ſevere.

The Lord Raby, who had for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years ſerved in the like capacity at the court of Pruſſia, ſucceeded Townſhend, in the month of March. This nobleman's chief recommendation to ſuch a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed office, was his high Tory principles, and his known averſion to the intereſts of the Duke of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough. His parts were feeble and uncomprehenſive. No knowledge of Books, no juſt obſervations on mankind, enlightened a mind which nature had left confuſed and obſcure<note n="B" place="bottom">Hannover-papers. Swift's Notes on Mackay, MS.</note>. His moſt ſplendid virtue was perſonal cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which he diſplayed upon various occaſions, before he quitted the field for the buſineſs of the cabinet. But his attachment to his party was more to be conſidered, than his abilities in diſcharging the duties of the office to which he was raiſed. Having been created Earl of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, in the beginning of September, he was ordered by the Queen to repair to Holland, to lay before the States the preliminaries which ſhe had accepted from the court of France. Strafford having arrived at the Hague, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the penſionary Heinſius, the preliminary articles ſettled between Great Britain and France. The States having had ſeveral ſecret conferences, declared to the Britiſh ambaſſador, that they found the articles ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and obſcure, that they were afraid they were ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calculated for ſerving as a foundation to a formal treaty. That, for this reaſon, their High Mightineſſes had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed M.

Buys accordingly arrived in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, on the eighteenth of October. But neither the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the States, nor the vehemence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of their envoy, were capable to change, or even to ſhake the reſolution formed by the Queen. She or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her ambaſſador to preſs the States to determine on a proper place for holding the congreſs. She required, at the ſame time, that paſſports ſhould be ſent immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the plenipotentiaries of France; and ſhe refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Buys, upon the whole, to the orders already tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Earl of Straſſord, at the Hague<note n="C" place="bottom">Hiſt. d'Angleterre M. de Torcy, tom. ii.</note>.</p>

The known principles of the commons prevented all oppoſition, in the lower houſe, to a law ſo favourable to the church. The Diſſenters, throughout the kingdom, were alarmed. They applied in vain to parliament. They preſented a petition, to no purpoſe, to the Earl of Oxford. Though his lordſhip and his family had joined almoſt uniformly in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Preſbyterians, he ſacrificed, upon the preſent occaſion, his religious profeſſions to his political views. The inconſiſtency of the Whigs was highly blamed by the moſt ſincere of their own party. They affirmed, that to ſerve their own views upon power, they made no ſcruple of deſerting their principles. To recommend themſelves to the preſumptive heirs of the crown, they had repealed all the limitations laid upon the royal prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, by the act of ſettlement. To carry a queſtion, in the houſe of lords, they made a ſacrifice of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoſe religious and political opinions had been their own chief ſupport with the nation<note n="U" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

The Duke of Hamilton, one of the ſixteen peers for Scotland, having been created a Peer of Great Britain, by the title of Duke of Brandon, claimed his place in that quality in the houſe of lords. His former attachment to the excluded family had rendered Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton obnoxious to the Whigs. His deſertion of the Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, at the Union of the two kingdoms, was not calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to recommend him to the Tories. The court, however, were obliged to ſupport a queſtion, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtrike at the prerogative of the crown. Lawyers were heard upon the patent<note n="W" place="bottom">Journals of the lords, Dec. 20, 1711.</note>. The right of the Queen to grant honours was admitted by all. None doubted that all the ſubjects of the united kingdoms were capable of being created peers. It ſeemed, therefore, extremely hard, that the nobility of Scotland ſhould be

debarred from a privilege, to which the reſt of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of that part of the kingdom had an undoubted title. But it was urged, on the other ſide, that the prerogative of the Crown could not operate againſt an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That the treaty of Union had made all the peers of Scotland peers of Great Britain, in every reſpect, except in voting in the houſe of lords, or ſitting in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on a peer. That having transferred their right of voting to ſixteen of their own number, they had all the portion of the legiſlature they had a right to poſſeſs; and that their being received into the houſe in any other way than by election, was to give them the double privilege of being preſent, at once, in their own perſons, and in thoſe of their repreſentatives<note n="X" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. iv.</note>.</p>

The apprehenſions expreſſed by ſome lords, in the courſe of the debate, were better founded than their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. They ſaid, that conſidering the dignity and antiquity of the peers of Scotland, together with the known poverty of many of that order, the miniſter would have no difficulty of ſecuring a majority in the houſe of lords, by calling them to that aſſembly by the means of new patents.

An uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chain of ſucceſs, through a courſe of many years, cannot juſtly be aſcribed to chance alone; and perſonal courage can never be denied, with juſtice, to a man who has been accuſed by his enemies to have delighted in war<note n="M" place="bottom">Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Times.

All his paſſions, at length, were either ſubdued or extinguiſhed by the love of money; and to that unhappy circumſtance muſt be aſcribed the ruin of his reputation. Upon the whole, if Marlborough is leſs to be admired than ſome other diſtinguiſhed ſtateſmen and generals, it is, perhaps, becauſe his ſecret intrigues and actions are better known.</p>

with his predeceſſor in office. Both were forced to adopt a line of conduct diametrically oppoſite to their principles and views. The Earl of Godolphin, though a Tory and Jacobite, was obliged, from the circumſtances of the times, to place himſelf at the head of the Whigs. The preſent treaſurer, though a Preſbyterian, and attached to the houſe of Hannover, was conſidered as the leader of the Tories, and a favourer of the claims of the Pretender. The bulk of mankind, ever deceived by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, judged of the two miniſters by their own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and prejudices. Godolphin, when in correſpondence with the court of St. Germains, was violently praiſed by many, and as extravagantly condemned by others, for his attachment to the Proteſtant ſucceſſion. Oxford was ſtill more unfortunate than his rival.

But, in a happy enthuſiaſm for his own religious opinions, or, perhaps, ultimately to gain the favour of that family moſt likely to ſucceed, he ſeemed determined to exclude all reſentment, and to ſhew that he was a much more ſincere friend than his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to the ſucceſſion of the Electoral family.</p>

His great deſire, when he aſſumed the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of affairs, was to retain the moſt moderate of the low-church party in office. The violence of his friends, as well as the rage of his enemies, put an end, for a time, to this trimming ſcheme. To balance, in ſome degree, the vehemence of the high-church party, he wiſhed to keep Marlborough at the head of the army<note n="A" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, Feb. 1712.</note>. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, however, defeated all his preſent ſchemes, while it proved fortunate for his future conduct. Though he had entered, with ſuch an appearance of firmneſs and zeal, into the ſcheme of making peace with France, his courage failed him when the Whigs began their clamours againſt the preliminaries. He therefore endeavoured, by

That miniſter, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſtruing Oxford's advances to his inability of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting himſelf, adviſed his maſter to reject his propoſals, and to adhere to the Whigs. He affirmed, that there was no reaſon to apprehend the Tories durſt conclude a ſeparate peace with France, or offend the populace by giving jealouſy to the confederates. He propoſed at the ſame time, that to amuſe the people of Great Britain, large promiſes ſhould be made by the Emperor, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, with redoubled vigour, the war.

He had the addreſs to procure from his friend, copies of moſt of the ambaſſador's diſpatches to the States-general and the court of Vienna. Being known to one Netterville and to Pen, the noted Quaker, he informed the Earl of Oxford, by their means, of the diſcoveries he had made. He placed the papers, to the number of twenty-four, in his hands. Among other matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, they contained the reſolution of the Duke of Savoy to adhere to the pacific meaſures of Queen Anne; together with a letter from the King of Portugal to the Emperor, importing, that he was reſolved to put an end, on his part, to the war.

But the Whigs having form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many viſionary projects for diſappointing the peace, the Count reſolved to adhere to their party. Plunket having failed in gaining his favour, reſolved to alarm his fears. He told him, that a deſign was on foot for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Pretender's ſiſter to Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. That Charles, from a proſpect of the ſucceſſion to the Britiſh crown in the right of his intended ſpouſe, would aſſiſt the Pretender with a Proteſtant army. That there would be no difficulty in tranſporting troops from Sweden to Scotland; and that a Prince of Charles's high military reputation and genius, would find little difficulty in eſtabliſhing his brother-in-law in a kingdom where he had ſo many and ſo zealous friends. The ambaſſador carried this intelligence to the Whigs. They were alarmed beyond meaſure. They ſent to the court of Hannover for an agent capable of ſupporting, in concern with themſelves, the intereſts of the Electoral family. The Baron de Bothmar arrived, accordingly, in London, in the month of November, in company with the Duke of Marlborough; and the memorial, preſented in the name of the Elector, againſt the peace, was the reſult of conferences between the miniſters of that Prince and the leaders of the Whig-party<note n="D" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1713.

The Whigs perceiving that Bothmar's memorial produced no effect, flew, with the uſual vehemence of party, into another ſcheme. They ſent to the Prince of Savoy to come immediately to London. The object of his journey was to lay before the Queen and the parliament the neceſſity of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the war. He was alſo to provide himſelf with proofs, that France had bought peace from the Britiſh court, for money. Upon this accuſation the Whigs, having a majority in the houſe of lords, were to ſend two or three of the cabinet-council to the Tower.

Though a caution, which his enemies called political timidity, might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Duke of Marlborough from adopting violent meaſures, there was no ſecurity againſt the ſchemes of the Prince: A man of great abilities, unconfined by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſanguine in his views; as determined in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his deſigns, as he was bold in undertaking the moſt deſperate meaſures. He kept one great object, his own ambition, perpetually in view. He puſhed forward, in one direct line, to that diſtinguiſhed point. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded obſtacles only as to their difficulty of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. He valued little the means he uſed; as he was taught by his pride that every thing calculated to extend his own greatneſs was allowable, if not juſt. In this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Eugene's mind, the only ſafety of the miniſtry conſiſted in his abſence from London. But the ſlow counſels of the houſe of Auſtria proved, according to cuſtom, highly favourable to their enemies.

                  <note place="margin">A majority made in the houſe of lords.</note> The Earl of Oxford, long perplexed with difficulties, became at length reſolute, through his very fears. He diſmiſſed the Duke of Marlborough from all his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But this meaſure was not ſufficient to ſecure him againſt the deſigns of the Whigs. Though the houſe of commons were ſubſervient to his wiſhes, there was alſo a neceſſity of gaining a majority to the meaſures of the court in the houſe of lords. The excluded party had acquired courage, as well as reputation, under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of one branch of the legiſlature. To deprive them of that advantage, was to purſue with effect the victory already gained by the miniſtry, by the removal of the Duke. A ſudden reſolution was taken to command the deliberations of the houſe of lords, by the creation of twelve new peers. The meaſure was deemed arbitrary and dangerous; but it could not be called illegal. It ſerved only to ſhew the party, that an oppoſition is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain againſt the crown, in an aſſembly whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of members depends on the will of the Prince. The lords having met on the ſecond of January, the new peers were introduced. They had ſcarce taken their ſeats, when they were called upon ſervice.

The Prince obtained an audience of the Queen; but he was coldly, though politely, received.

The Whigs were much elevated at the arrival of his Highneſs, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture ſo critical to their affairs.

They were no ſtrangers to the principles, or rather the views, of the Earl of Oxford, in favour of the family of Hannover. They knew, that to defeat the peace was to ruin the miniſter. Nothing but the fear of falling into the hands of the Whigs had induced them to ſupport the court. Had the leaders of the latter party followed a more moderate line of conduct, the Earl of Oxford muſt have fallen by the hands of his ſuppoſed friends. In the preceding autumn, the adherents of the excluded family had diſcovered, that they could form no hopes to their cauſe on the favour of the lord-treaſurer. Neither the Queen, nor her favourite, now Lady Maſham, were ignorant of this circumſtance; but both dreaded what they called the tyranny of the Whigs, ſhould the lord-treaſurer, by the deſertion of the Tories, be forced to reſign.</p>

That then the crown might be ſettled by the Whigs, and the war be carried on with redoubled vigour. Theſe obſervations devolved the diſcourſe on the Baron de Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. He averred, that though the diſorders might be the ſame, the ſame remedies were impracticable; that the nation was not ſufficiently prepared for a revolution; that the prejudices of the vulgar, the great engine in ſuch daring enterpriſes, were ſtill upon the ſide of the enemy; that though the Queen was ſuſpected of favouring a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſucceſſor, ſhe herſelf was a ſtrict Proteſtant; that the jealouſy concerning religion was too feeble, on account of the diſtance of the danger; that though circumſtances had even been more favourable, the experiment would be extremely dangerous; that a miſcarriage would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ruin the undertaking, load the family of Hannover with the public hatred, and exclude them from the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the crown.

Plunket, thinking that Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene ſhould be committed to priſon, had ſent a detail of the whole, by the hands of the Earl of Yarmouth, to the Duke of Buckingham, and to Harcourt, the lord-keeper. They laid it inſtantly before the reſt of the cabinet. The Earl of Oxford was alarmed. He knew their principles, and he was afraid of their violence. He entreated them to make no motion in the buſineſs. They affirmed, that the thing concerned them too nearly to be dropt without examination. They ordered Plunket to appear; but Oxford carried him firſt to Queen Anne. The Duke of Buckingham brought him before the cabinet. He was examined with ſtrictneſs. They promiſed to provide for him, during life, for his ſervices. They ordered him to repair to Holland, to induce, by promiſes, the friend from whom he had received the Prince of Savoy's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to come to London, to lay the whole proceedings of the confederates and Whigs before the parliament and the nation<note n="U" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1713.

Having taken under conſideration the report of the commiſſioners of public accounts, they found that Mr. Robert Walpole had been guilty of a high breach of truſt and notorious corruption. Upon the oath of one of his agents it appeared, that Walpole had received five hundred guineas, and a note for five hundred more, for two contracts, made by him when ſecretary at war, for ſupplying the troops in North Britain with forage. Though the ſhameful venality of this man deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, his connexion with the former miniſtry was more the object of reſentment than his offence.

Robert Walpole to a cenſure on the Duke of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough. Upon examining the charge againſt that noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for having taken money of the contractors for bread and bread-waggons, and for deducting for his own uſe two and one half per cent. from the pay of the foreign troops in Flanders, in the pay of Great Britain, they came to a reſolution, that the Duke, in receiving thoſe ſums, had been guilty of unwarrantable and illegal practices. Their vote was laid by the whole houſe before her Majeſty. The attorney-general was directed to proſecute the duke. But either no proſecution was ever commenced, or it was carried on with a languor that defeated its deſign. To throw diſgrace on Marlborough was more the object of the miniſter than the refunding of the public money. To accompliſh the firſt the commons extended their animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions to his family and ſervants.

This ſecret was reſerved by the miniſtry for Mr. Prior, who was expected in quality of third plenipotentiary from Great Britain. The Britiſh plenipotentiaries, confined in their powers, converſed ſtill with thoſe of France, in the ſtile of enemies.

The avowed object of his journey was to receive his ultimate inſtructions to conclude the treaty, as ſoon as the King of Spain's anſwer ſhould be received. When his anſwer was, accordingly received, in the beginning of June, the Queen agreed to a ſuſpenſion of arms.

Though ſhe had created twelve new peers, the majority for government in the houſe of lords was ſo ſlender, that every vote was liable to accidents. When, upon rejecting the Duke of Hamilton's patent, the peers of Scotland abſented themſelves, the Whigs carried a diſagreeable addreſs from the upper-houſe to the throne. The efforts of the treaſurer, though he was ſuppoſed to have offered weighty arguments upon the ſubject, was not ſufficient to recall the refractory Scots to their duty in parliament. Many of them were, from principle, attached to the Pretender. Reſentment had rouſed others to a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined reſolution of oppoſing all the meaſures of the Whigs.

He could, therefore, deceive a race of men blinded by an enthuſiaſtic zeal for their own cauſe. The Lady Maſham, adopting the inclinations of her miſtreſs, was much in the intereſt of the Pretender. Her friendſhip for Oxford had long ſince declined. She wrote to M.

Urged by the Jacobites, and the moſt violent of the high-church party, ſhe is ſaid to have to reſolved to lay before the parliament the ſecret practices of Prince Eugene, and the dangerous ſchemes of the Baron de Bothmar. The principles of the Earl of Oxford had been highly ſerviceable to the intereſts of the Electoral family. Though the idle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of an invaſion proceeded from the indiſcreet zeal of his miniſter, the Elector himſelf had avowed openly his diſapprobation of the conduct of the Britiſh court.

But though theſe were her inclinations, the ſame happy timidity which gave riſe to her anxiety, prevented her from entering, with effectual eagerneſs, into her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's cauſe. She reſted all her hopes upon the court of France. She hoped, from the gratitude of Lewis the Fourteenth, for the repoſe which ſhe alone could beſtow, a ſupport againſt the ſchemes of the confederates and Whigs. Urged by theſe and ſimiliar motives, ſhe could no longer hide her anxiety for peace. In the moment that fortune, by the demiſe of the Dauphin and his ſon, threatened to throw back the houſe of Bourbon into all the perils of a diſaſtrous war, they were ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, by the timidity of the Queen of Great Britain. The miniſtry, rouſed by terrors for themſelves, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually eager for breaking, by a ſeparate peace, the power of the confederates. Thus every thing conſpired to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate France with advantage, and a degree of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of a war that once threatened the diſſolution of her monarchy.</p>

That the renunciation of Philip, offered as a ſecurity, was rather a matter of ridicule, than any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous propoſal. That the promiſes and oaths of Princes were but weak obſtacles in the way of their ambition. That France herſelf had been ſo juſt as to own, that any agreement of a Prince to break the ſucceſſion of a crown was nugatory, as being contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom. That, ſhould King Philip think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound by his own renunciation, neither his poſterity nor the French themſelves would allow that he had a power to extend the obligation beyond his own life. That, however inſignificant the rights of monarchy might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the people of Great Britain, who had broken the line of ſucceſſion in their own country, the thing was regarded with another eye in France, where the deſcent of the crown was deemed the firſt link of that great chain which kept together the vaſt body of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>

                  <note place="margin">and for the peace.</note> On the other ſide, it was affirmed, that, ſince the commencement of the war, the face of things was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally changed; that France, broken by a ſeries of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon misfortunes, had ceaſed to be dangerous; that, as the ſtate of affairs now ſtood, freſh expedients and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were not only proper, but even neceſſary. That when the war began, King Charles the Third was only a titular monarch, without a revenue, without power, and without importance. That the caſe was now much alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that Prince had obtained the hereditary dominions of the houſe of Auſtria, together with the imperial crown. That it would be the height of folly to revive, in the perſon of the preſent Emperor, the power which endangered Europe in the days of Charles the Fifth. That, ſhould the confederates reſolve at any rate to place the crown of Spain on the head of the Emperor, the ſucceſs would at beſt be doubtful. That it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely idle, and highly impolitic, to throw away blood and treaſure on an undertaking, which, by being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, would deſtroy that very balance for which the maritime powers had ſo long contended with the houſe of Bourbon. That, as to Philip's renunciation, though a ſlender thing in itſelf, it derived great force from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:0709200302:525"/>
of thoſe who were to enjoy its benefits; that, as matters were ſituated, the beſt means had been uſed for anſwering the end for which the war began; that there was at preſent but a bare poſſibility that the ſucceſſion of France ſhould fall to the ſhare of the King of Spain; but that there was a certainty of preſent danger, from the union of the Spaniſh monarchy to the power of the houſe of Auſtria, ſtrengthened by the influence derived by that family from an uninterrupted poſſeſſion of the Imperial crown.</p>

But the lords adjourned the buſineſs to the next day; and, when they met, fell into warm debates. Though the Whigs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to deſpiſe the articles of the propoſed peace, theſe were well received by the body of a nation already groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the burden of an unprofitable war. The terms were deemed by the diſpaſſionate favourable to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In the treaty of the year 1709, upon which the excluded party highly valued themſelves, no ſpecific ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to Great Britain were propoſed. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe had not only obtained a ſecurity to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, but even an acceſſion of territory. The truth is, that the whole was very inadequate to the expence of the war, and unſuitable to its uncommon ſucceſs. No doubt can now be entertained, that, had the confederates continued to preſs France on the ſide of Flanders, but the crown of Spain muſt have been relinquiſhed by the houſe of Bourbon. But it is extremely doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Britiſh miniſtry were acquainted with a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which the French only owned when the ſeaſon for redreſſing the evil was paſt. The oppoſition in the houſe of lords, deſpairing to prevent the addreſs, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to clog it with an amendment. They propoſed an addition to the motion for obtaining the guarantee of the allies to the treaty: but, upon a diviſion, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by a great majority<note n="D" place="bottom">June 7.</note>.

Beſides the great buſineſs of the treaty, and the conſequent conteſts of parties on that ſubject, ſome other affairs, that deſerve to be mentioned, fell under diſcuſſion in the two houſes. The act for a general naturalization of all foreign Proteſtants was repealed<note n="F" place="bottom">Feb. 9.</note>. This law, which had been paſſed by the Whigs when in power, had been always odious to the high-church party. They ſaid, that as moſt Proteſtants abroad differed from the church-government eſtabliſhed in England, ſo the natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing bill was calculated to increaſe the number of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters in the kingdom. But, after the ſurmiſes of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected invaſion were carried to the miniſtry, one other eſſential reaſon was added to the former, for repealing the act. The party affirmed, that when that law ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no importation of foreign Proteſtants could be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed illegal; that a foreign Prince might become, when he pleaſed, maſter of the kingdom, by ſending judiciouſly his ſubjects before him into a country where they became denizens, at the expence of a ſhilling a head, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon price of an oath to the government. That, ſhould ſuch a Prince, which was likely to be ſoon the caſe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the throne of Great Britain, he might, without any breach on the laws of the kingdom, enſlave the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with an army of his native ſubjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> The repealing of the act of naturalization was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Diſſenters in the light of an attack upon themſelves. But this was not the only invaſion on their eſtabliſhed opinions, of which they choſe to complain. The commons, in their attachment to the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, extended their protection to the epiſcopal clergy in Scotland. A bill was introduced, for granting a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all ſuch as ſhould uſe the liturgy of the church, in that part of the kingdom. The thing ſeemed ſo reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that no oppoſition was made. But a clauſe in the bill required the civil magiſtrates to execute none of the ſentences of the judicatory of the church of Scotland. The Preſbyterians were alarmed at a circumſtance, that annihilated their eccleſiaſtical authority. The bill, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, paſſed with little oppoſition in either houſe. It was
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:0709200302:527"/>
followed by another, which was contrary to the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian principles. The courts of judicature in Scotland were commanded, by an act, to diſcontinue their ſittings, during ſome days at Chriſtmas, though the obſerving of holidays is contrary to the tenets of Preſbytery. But the moſt mortifying act of all, was that for reſtoring patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, which had been aboliſhed in King William's reign. In vain was it urged, that ſuch an invaſion on the church of Scotland was a breach upon the union of the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, by which the rights of Preſbytery were unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſecured.

The Prince of Savoy had received a reinforcement of Germans, that increaſed the army to the number of one hundred and twenty-two thouſand men. The Duke of Ormond, who had ſucceeded Marlborough in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Britiſh forces, and ſuch troops as were in Britiſh pay, arrived in the camp near Douay, in the end of April.

The ſtrong ſituation of the French army, under the Mareſchal de Villars, who had poſted himſelf behind the Scheld, had induced the Duke to hope that no action could happen. The Prince of Savoy, however, finding that the enemy had not occupied with entrenchments the ſmall ſpace between the ſource of the Somme and that of the Scheld, made diſpoſitions for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking Villars. His deſign was to decide the fate of the war by a battle, or to force the French to retire, and to

His Grace declining to give an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate anſwer, confirmed the Prince in the ſuſpicions which he had for ſome time entertained. The deputies of the States ſent an immediate account of Ormond's inactivity to the Hague. The States ſent an expreſs to the court of Great Britain.

The States, in particular, were afraid of a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible reverſe of fortune, at the end of a proſperous war. Their plenipotentiaries at Utrecht reproached the Biſhop of Briſtol with the odious conduct of his court.

That circumſtance, which was likely to happen, would infallibly raiſe the clamours of the populace againſt the miniſtry, terrify the Tories in parliament, and give a plauſible pretext to the Whigs to ſend the authors of the ineffectual peace to the Tower. The Duke, in conjunction with the Lords Halifax and Somers, propoſed another ſcheme, more deciſive in its conſequences, but leſs eaſy to be accompliſhed. They adviſed the States to aſſiſt the Elector of Hannover to paſs with a force into Great Britain. Their project was to ſpread a report, that the Pretender, at the inſtigation of the miniſtry, was preparing to invade the kingdom with a French army; and, at the ſame time, to declare in a manifeſto, that his Electoral Highneſs was arrived, to ſecure the ſucceſſion of the crown in the Proteſtant line<note n="K" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1713.</note>. They affirmed, that the people, alarmed for their religion and liberty, would flock round his ſtandard; and that the Queen, like her father, would make her eſcape to France. This plauſible project is ſaid to have been tranſmitted to the Princeſs Sophia. But the leſs violent Whigs are reported to have adviſed her clandeſtinely to refuſe her conſent; as that meaſure might furniſh the Tories, already averſe from the intereſts of her family, with a pretence for altering the ſucceſſion<note n="L" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

But when Ormond communicated his orders for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the generals of the auxiliaries, they refuſed to obey.

Orders were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſpatched for delivering Dunkirk to the Britiſh troops. The obſtructions experienced already by the Duke of Ormond induced the miniſtry to place the fate of the peace in a kind of independence upon accident. They ſent Sir John Leake to take the command of the fleet in the Downs. They ordered him to provide tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for carrying troops to occupy Dunkirk from Great Britain. On the eighth of July, Brigadier Hill took poſſeſſion of the place. Two days before this event, the Prince of Savoy ſeparated himſelf from the Britiſh troops, and ſat down before Landrecy. The Duke of Ormond, directing his route to Aveſne le Seiq, declared, at that place, a ſuſpenſion of arms. In his march toward Ghent, which city, together with Bruges, he intended to occupy, he was refuſed by the confederates a paſſage through Bouchain. He was treated with the ſame diſreſpect and diſtruſt by the garriſons of Douay, Tournay, Oudenarde, and Liſle. On the twelfth of July, the Duke took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Ghent, and, ſoon after, of Bruges; and thus, by commanding the navigation of the Lys and Scheld, became the umpire of the operations between the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armies<note n="P" place="bottom">Publications of the Times.</note>.</p>

That lord's force, at laſt, conſiſted of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand men.

Four battalions of Palatines and other German auxiliaries threw down their arms and fled. The whole French line, having paſſed the Scheld, were led by Villars againſt the camp of the Earl of Albemarle. He marched up to the enemy, without firing a ſingle ſhot. He entered the intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cut thoſe who reſiſted to pieces, and forced the ſurvivors to fly. But their retreat was cut off by the precaution of the French general, who had occupied a bridge, which they had built behind, on the Scheld.</p>

No enterpriſe of conſequence was undertaken, no action of renown happened on any other ſide of the war. In Italy, the Imperialiſts beſieged and took Porto Hercole. In Spain, the Count de Staremberg, though delivered from a formidable enemy by the death of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dôme, attempted nothing important.

In Dauphiné and Savoy, the ſummer was ſpent by the contending armies in obſerving each other's motions. An inactivity prevailed on the frontiers of Portugal. The Duke of Wirtemberg, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the army of the Empire on the Rhine, formed a project, toward the end of the campaign, to force the lines of Weiſſembourg, and to penetrate into Alſace.

But this power was annexed to the indiſpenſable condition of obtaining Sicily for the Duke of Savoy. The Queen of Great Britain expreſſed a particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that Prince, which might be conſidered unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable upon any other grounds, than her deeming his family, after herſelf and the Pretender, the next in blood to the ſucceſſion of the crown, upon the ancient form.

                  <note place="margin">Bolingbroke ſent to France.</note> This ſudden reſolution of ſending Bolingbroke to France proceeded from the earneſtneſs for peace expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon every occaſion by that lord. He had adviſed the Queen to prefer a ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities, as the moſt certain means of obviating the difficulties which the enemies of peace oppoſed to a ſimple ceſſation of arms. The example of Great Britain, he affirmed, would be ſoon followed by the confederates. The Kings of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal and Pruſſia, he ſaid, as well as the Duke of Savoy, and the Dutch, were too prudent to continue the war after the ſeparation of ſuch a powerful ally as Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and, ſhould the Emperor and empire ſacrifice their convenience and intereſt to their reſentment, he aſſured her, that they would ſoon drop a conteſt which they could not maintain with any effect. The Earl of Oxford oppoſed the advice of Bolingbroke, to avoid giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Elector of Hannover. Though he was attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from principle to that Prince, he was apprehenſive of being called to an account whenever he ſhould aſcend the

Britiſh throne. This event ſeemed to be at no great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as the Queen daily declined in her health. This was the cauſe of all thoſe delays and uneaſineſſes which might have been prevented by a definitive treaty between Great Britain and France. This conduct was extremely impolitic in the miniſter, as it gave an appearance of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity to his meaſures; a circumſtance which expoſed him to all the machinations and intrigues of his own ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and thoſe of the peace<note n="Y" place="bottom">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.

The two miniſters, poſſeſſed of unlimited powers from their reſpective courts, ſoon agreed: That the Duke of Savoy and his deſcendants ſhould be called to the throne of Spain, in default of King Philip and his male poſterity. That this ſubſtitution ſhould be inſerted in all the public acts, with regard to the renunciation of Philip's right to the crown of France. That the renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation itſelf ſhould be regiſtered in the books of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Paris, and admitted ſolemnly by the cortes or ſtates of Caſtile and Arragon. That the ceſſion of Sicily to the Duke of Savoy ſhould for the preſent remain a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for various reaſons. But that he ſhould never be ſuffered to alienate that iſland for any other territory. The article of the barrier to this favoured Prince was not ſo eaſily ſettled. The French miniſter refuſed to grant more for that purpoſe than Exilles, Feneſtrelles, and the valley of Pragelas. This whole affair was therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the general congreſs at Utrecht. The two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of Great Britain and France having ſettled theſe terms, the Viſcount Bolingbroke had an audience of the French King. He was received with the utmoſt polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by that Prince; and was treated by the whole court with a reſpect ſuitable to the earneſt deſire of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for peace.

                  <note place="margin">States eager for peace.</note> The change of affairs in Flanders had rendered the confederates ſenſible that they were incapable to maintain the war ſhould Great Britain deſert the grand alliance. The Dutch, who had moſt to loſe by a continuation of hoſtilities, were the firſt who ſeriouſly thought of peace. The defeat at Denain, the ſubſequent misfortunes, the diſappointment of the projects of the Prince of Savoy, had blaſted their hopes and humbled their pride. Their eyes were opened to the true ſtate of their affairs. They deſcended at once from that haughtineſs with which they had been inſpired by the ſucceſs of the war. Inſtead of preſcribing terms to the houſe of Bourbon, they ſolicited the good offices of Great Britain, for renewing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which had been long interrupted by their own obſtinacy. They dropt their pretenſions of receiving all the anſwers of the French plenipotentiaries in writing. The latter, therefore, agreed to renew the conferences, upon condition that the Queen of Great Britain's ſpeech to her parliament ſhould be admitted as the plan of the treaty. The miniſters of the other allies were alarmed at the puſillanimity of the Dutch. Count Zinzendorff, the Imperial miniſter, repeated his exhortations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. He aſſured them, that the Prince of Savoy was on his march to fight Villars. That he was ſure of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. That, as there was no riſk in ſuſpending the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, the States ought to temporize, by waiting for the reſult of events<note n="A" place="bottom">Swift's Four Years.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">An incident interrupts the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</note> Zinzendorff prevailed. The conferences, under vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretences, were delayed. But when time brought no favourable change, the Dutch fell into their former fears. They redoubled their ſolicitations for the renewal of the conferences of Utrecht. A ſilly quarrel between the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of M. Menager, one of the French plenipotenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, and thoſe of the Count de Rechteren, deputy of the province of Overyſſel, interrupted again the great work of peace. The French King took advantage of the folly of Rechteren, as it was not his intereſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with the allies till he had ſettled his meaſures with the Viſcount Bolingbroke. The pretence itſelf was plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. He inſiſted that the States ſhould declare whether Rechteren followed their orders in his inſolent conduct,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:0709200302:537"/>
or whether he had purſued the dictates of a paſſionate mind, inflamed by the arts of the houſe of Auſtria. If he acted in obedience to his maſters, there was no ſafety, he ſaid, for his miniſters at Utrecht. If he had no guide but his own paſſion, the States were called upon to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow the conduct of a ſervant who had abuſed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. The French King therefore told them, that Rechteren ſhould be recalled by his conſtituents, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deputy be appointed in his place. This dictatorial conduct, ſo contrary to the abject behaviour of the court of France in the year 1709, was not capable to raiſe the indignation of the States. The haughtineſs, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the name of ſpirit at that period, had vaniſhed with their good fortune; and they ſuffered an enemy whom they deſpiſed to retort upon them their own wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton inſolence with impunity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen interferes for the Dutch.</note> The abject behaviour of the States was, at preſent, of ſome advantage to their affairs. Their ſubmiſſion to the French reconciled the court of Great Britain to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. The reſentment of the Britiſh nation ceaſed, with the obſtinacy of the Dutch. The miniſtry reſolved to interfere in their cauſe. They preſſed, therefore, the court of France to a ſeparate peace. They deſired them to regiſter immediately the renunciations, as on them the peace of Europe depended. That, upon the fulfilling of this eſſential article, the Queen of Great Britain ſhould declare, that ſhe could obtain no other plan but that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by France. That it was the buſineſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to determine upon this head. That they ſhould have three months to conſider; but that the French King ſhould be no longer obliged to grant even theſe terms, after the expiration of the time. The Queen inſiſted, in return, with the court of Verſailles, to depart from their claims, on the reſtitution of Tournay<note n="B" place="bottom">M. de Torcy, tom. ii.</note>. That town, ſhe ſaid, as it was the great object of the States, was alſo neceſſary to their barrier. Though Lewis had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to retain Tournay, he yielded prudently to her requeſt. He ſound, that by the bad ſtate of the Queen's health, there was reaſon to fear ſhe might die in the midſt of an unfiniſhed war. He knew that the miniſtry muſt fall with her life.

                  <note place="margin">Secret views of the Queen</note> This prudential conceſſion of Lewis the Fourteenth, ſmoothed the way for a treaty which was not deſtined to be ſoon concluded. But though the clandeſtine meaſures, for reſtoring peace, employed much of the time of Queen Anne, a part of her attention was turned to views that were ſtill more ſecret.

But ſhe perceived obſtacles in his way, which he himſelf had not the ſtrength of mind to remove. In her own attachment to the church of England, ſhe ſignified her inclinations that the Pretender ſhould relinquiſh Popery, and place himſelf in a capacity of being ſerved. When ſhe was urged, by the Duke of Buckingham, to endeavour to break the ſucceſſion in the Proteſtant line, her anſwer, though it conveyed a regard for her brother, was ſuitable to good ſenſe and prudence. <q rend="inline">"How can I ſerve him,"</q> ſhe ſaid, <q rend="inline">"my Lord?

He affirmed, he had ſo little prejudice againſt the religion of his country, that he intended to carry along with him, to the place of his exile, a Proteſtant clergyman, to officiate to his Proteſtant ſervants. That when he ſhould be permitted to return to Great Britain, he would be ready to hear ſuch arguments as might induce him to change his preſent faith. That it was even the intereſt of England to have a Prince on the throne, whoſe religion would leſſen the power which the conſtitution had placed in his hands. That, as he was ready to relinquiſh, during his own time, the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of nominating Biſhops, and of appointing clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to livings, no danger could be apprehended by the eſtabliſhed church.

A man who relinquiſhed his hopes of a great kingdom; for a ſpeculative tenet of faith, diſcovered a degree of enthuſiaſm that ought never to be truſted. Inſincerity itſelf is leſs a crime in a prince than folly. He who wiſhes to govern nations, muſt rule them through their principles; otherwiſe his government becomes a tyranny, and only laſts as long as it is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Among a people accuſtomed to monarchy, the Sovereign only is capable of ſhaking his own throne. To differ from his ſubjects, in their religious opinions, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the only prerogative which he may not, without danger, employ. Of all mankind, HE has the leaſt right to be ſingular in his faith. If he is not willing to go to heaven in the ſame way with his people, they will ſcaree acknowledge the legality of his authority on earth. That public affection, which is the chief ſupport of his throne muſt be changed for ſuſpicion and jealouſy. A mutual diſtruſt prevails, which will ſoon degenerate into that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgiving averſion, that invariably follows a difference of faith, in feeble minds. When ſociety is even mellowed down into an indifference, which borders on infidelity

the worſt conſequences are to be expected and feared. Indignation againſt the weakneſs of a bigot will, even then, ſupply the place of religious zeal; and violence itſelf becomes juſt, in a certain degree, when it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to folly.</p>

Great Britain, who firſt began the negociation, was deſtined to conclude the treaty. The Duke of Shrewſberry and the Marquis de Torcy ſettled the plan of a general peace at Paris, which a courier carried to Utrecht, in the middle of March. The Portugueſe and Dutch had already agreed to put an end to their part of the war. Others prepared to follow their example. On the twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of March, the lord privy-ſeal and the Earl of Stafford acquainted the miniſters of the allies, that they had appointed the thirty-firſt for ſigning a treaty of peace, and one of commerce, between the Queen of Great Britain and France.

Their ſovereign, deſtitute of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources for action, became timid and undeciſive in his counſels.

Inſtead of deriving ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from indignation and deſpair, the court of Verſailles yielded to thoſe unmanly complaints, that deprive even misfortune itſelf of regret. In this untoward ſtate of their affairs, the fate of the houſe of Bourbon depended upon the Queen of Great Britain; and, as the humanity, which ought ever to be extended to private diſtreſs, is frequently ſacrificed to utility in public tranſactions, ſhe could ſcarce be blamed for making a more rigorous uſe of the advantages which fortune had placed in her hands.</p>

                  <note place="margin">on the peace of Utrecht.</note> With regard to the confederates, the moſt of them were highly ſatisfied, and none had any great reaſon to complain. The King of Pruſſia obtained all his demands. The Duke of Savoy was recompenſed beyond his moſt ſanguine hopes. He had obtained the ceſſion of Savoy, the diſtrict of Nice, with all that he had received in Italy, from the Emperor Leopold. He was raiſed to the regal title and to the throne of Sicily; and he was eventually to ſucceed to the crown of Spain, in default of Philip the Fifth and his iſſue-male. The King of Portugal had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed little to the carrying on of the war, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from the peace were few, and, without heſitation, granted. Luxembourg, Namur, Charleroi, together with the other cities already in their poſſeſſion, were given, as a barrier, to the States. Their commerce with France was placed on the foundation eſtabliſhed by the tariff of 1664. With regard to the Empire, the Rhine was to form its limits on the ſide of France. All forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, either poſſeſſed or raiſed by the French, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that river, were to be reſtored to the Emperor, or deſtroyed. The kingdom of Naples and the dutchy of Milan were ceded for ever to his Imperial Majeſty; and the reſt of the dominions of Italy, that had changed maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the courſe of the war, were to return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſovereigns. There was a conſiderable difference, it muſt be confeſſed, between theſe terms and thoſe offered by France in the year 1709. But a change of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may juſtify an alteration of ſentiments. Without abandoning the project of reducing the too great power of the houſe of Bourbon, the Britiſh miniſtry might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, that there was an equal neceſſity for preſcribing limits to the vaſt claims of the family of Auſtria.</p>

The bulk of the nation were hitherto favourable to the miniſtry. To retain their confidence was a matter of the laſt importance to the Earl of Oxford; as, by the triennial act, the preſent parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was near its end. The Whigs, to influence the approaching elections, had propagated, with more aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity than ſucceſs, an opinion, that the Queen and her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were irrecoverably in the intereſt of the Pretender.

The danger of the Proteſtant ſucceſſion, from the Queen and her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, had been long a favourite topic with that party. They were at great pains to inform the public, that the courts of London and Hannover were upon the very worſt terms. Though this was a notorious fact, they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto found it difficult to perſuade the populace on that head. To remove every impreſſion of this kind, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter formed a deſign of inducing the Queen to aſſure her parliament, in her ſpeech from the throne, that the utmoſt harmony ſubſiſted between her and the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heirs of her crown.

She opened the ſeſſion of parliament, on the ninth of April, with a ſpeech from the throne. She informed the two houſes that the negociations of peace were brought to a happy concluſion. She mentioned what ſhe had done for the ſecurity of the Proteſtant ſucceſſion. She expreſſed her hopes, that the perfect friendſhip which ſubſiſted between her and the houſe of Hannover, would effectually diſappoint ſuch perſons as made a merit of ſeparating their intereſts. She demanded of the commons the neceſſary ſupplies. She earneſtly recommended the cultivating of the arts of peace, as the beſt means for repairing the loſſes ſuſtained by the enormous expence of the war. She complained of the licence of the preſs, and the dangerous growth of the impious practice of duelling. She mentioned the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of reſtraining both theſe evils, with new laws; as the old were inadequate to that ſalutary purpoſe. She left, ſhe ſaid, the force neceſſary for the protection of the nation, to the wiſdom of her parliament. As for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhe wanted no protection but the loyalty of her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; no guarantee but the intereſt ſhe had in their hearts.

                  <note place="margin">The Whigs diſconcerted</note> This judicious ſpeech diſconcerted the Whigs in all their projects.

They entreated his Highneſs, for the ſake of God<note n="Y" place="bottom">Hannover-papers, 1713.</note>, to ſend over the Electoral Prince. Without the preſence of one of the family, they ſolemnly averred, that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion muſt inevitably be defeated. This requeſt they had frequently made, to no purpoſe, before the meeting of parliament. They now renewed their entreaties with more confidence, as their own condition was more help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and the juncture itſelf more favourable.

Though no communication of the treaty had been made to the two houſes, they had returned general thanks for the peace. The commons granted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſupplies<note n="A" place="bottom">Journals, April 13.</note>. They reduced the troops and navy, according to the directions of the court. They gained the army, by allowing half-pay to the officers. They ſecured their influence with their conſtituents, by reducing the land-tax to two ſhillings in the pound. In the midſt of this attention to the nation, they ſhewed their attachment to the miniſtry. The commiſſioners for examining the accounts of the army made a report that bore hard on former miſmanagements. Some inſtances of corruption and embezzlement of public money were detected. But it ſoon appeared that the houſe was more eager to expoſe the enemies of the prevailing party, than to puniſh the guilty. One William Churchill, a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was ſlightly cenſured. A vote was paſſed againſt the Earl of Wharton, for having ſold an office for a thouſand pounds.

                  <note place="margin">Treaty of commerce before the houſe.</note> This appearance of unanimity in the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was ſoon interrupted, by an important debate.

<pb n="538" facs="tcp:0709200302:561"/>
were highly pleaſed, that a period was put to a war whoſe exceſſive weight had rendered them inſenſible to its renown. The treaty which ſettled the ceſſion of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories between her Britannic Majeſty and the French King, was accompanied by a treaty of commerce between Great Britain and France. The ratifications of the two treaties had been exchanged at Utrecht, on the twenty-eighth of April. On the ninth of May, Mr. Benſon, chancellor of the exchequer, delivered to the commons a meſſage from the Queen. She informed the houſe, that though it was the undoubted prerogative of the crown to make peace and war, ſhe had reſolved from the beginning to communicate to her parliament the treaties ſhe had now concluded<note n="C" place="bottom">Journals, May 9th.</note>. The houſe appointed the fourteenth of May, for reſolving themſelves into a grand committee, to conſider the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of navagation and commerce. A converſation, rather than a debate, paſſed between the parties, on the treaty of peace. The Whigs found, in the treaty of commerce, the beſt ground for oppoſing the court, with any proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Arguments for and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</note> When the houſe met, on the fourteenth of May, a motion was made to bring in a bill to make good the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of commerce. A violent debate aroſe between the friends of the miniſter and the leaders of the Whigs. The firſt endeavoured to prove, that a great advantage would reſult to the nation from a free commerce with France. The latter affirmed, that a trade with that kingdom would prove extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the woollen, ſilk, and paper manufactories; and above all, to the commerce with Portugal, which brought annually ſo much bullion into the kingdom. The friends of the miniſtry deduced their arguments from an enumeration of the vaſt quantities of Britiſh commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties exported to France before the two laſt wars. The Whigs averred that ſince the Revolution, the ſtate of commerce was entirely changed. That France had ſet up and encouraged woollen manufactures of her own. That Britain had learned, in the courſe of ſo many years to accommodate herſelf without the product of France<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

ſhould Britain even be capable of balancing her own trade with France, ſhe could not prevent the latter king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from engroſſing the commerce of other countries. That the increaſe of the trade to Portugal, the moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble branch of Britiſh commerce, was owing to the high duties, which amounted to a kind of prohibition of French wines. That ſhould the duties on theſe wines be reduced to an equality with thoſe on the wines of Portugal, the trade with that kingdom would be loſt; as men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral would prefer the wines of France, when they could be purchaſed at the ſame rate<note n="D" place="bottom">Debates, printed.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Bill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it rejected.</note> The adherents of the miniſtry advanced arguments equally ſolid and concluſive. But when parties are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed againſt each other, paſſion decides in the place of reaſon. Upon a diviſion of the houſe, the bill was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be introduced, by a great majority<note n="E" place="bottom">252 againſt 130.</note>. The Whigs, adhering to their purpoſe of diſtreſſing the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, called the prejudices of the nation to their aid. They carried their arguments to the preſs. The lord-treaſurer oppoſed them, on the ſame ground. But the fate of the bill was not ultimately determined by this public conteſt. Many of the Tories, to the laſt degree offended at the trimming conduct of the Earl of Oxford, had reſolved to join the Whigs, on the preſent occaſion, to accompliſh his ruin. Sir Thomas Hanmer, though he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in concluding the treaty of commerce, oppoſed it, with vehemence, as the beſt ground for affronting the lord-treaſurer. He was at the head of a ſociety of forty members of the houſe of commons, who called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the October-club. This junto reſolved to throw their whole weight in the ſcale of the oppoſing party; and to terrify the Earl of Oxford into deciſive meaſures for the Pretender. They had frequently requeſted him, in vain, to remove the Whigs from the lieutenancy of the counties, the commiſſions of the peace, and the offices of the revenue. He had repeatedly made the moſt ſolemn promiſes upon this ſubject. But though the diſſolution of parliament was approaching, he had hitherto done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in an affair upon which the ſucceſs of the Tories, at the new elections, ſo much depended<note n="F" place="bottom">Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art-papers, June 23, 1713.</note>. When, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the bill was brought to a debate, the moſt violent of

the Tories, led by Hanmer, oppoſed its being engroſſed; and, upon a diviſion of the houſe, carried their point, by a majority of nine votes<note n="G" place="bottom">194 againſt 185.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Diſcontents of the Scots.</note> During the dependence of this bill, another matter of ſtill greater importance employed the attention of parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament. The houſe of commons, in renewing the duty on malt, for another year, extended that tax to Scotland. The members for that part of the kingdom, unanimouſly oppoſed the meaſure. They complained, that the duty, in itſelf too great a burden for their country, was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to an expreſs article of the Union between the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. That it had been ſtipulated by that treaty, that no duty ſhould be laid on malt in North-Britain during the continuance of the war. That, though hoſtilities had ceaſed, no formal peace was yet concluded with Spain. That, though a pacification between the two crowns was no longer a matter of uncertainty, yet it was a maxim in law, that odious things were to be literally underſtood; but that matters of favour were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted with more liberality. That as the tax itſelf was, by the expreſs words of the bill, to be applied to deficiencies in the war, this act laid an impoſt on the Scots, from which they were evidently exempted by the treaty of Union<note n="H" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. iv.</note>. Theſe arguments made a great impreſſion on the houſe; but, on a diviſion, a majority appeared on the ſide of the bill. The Scotiſh members, in both houſes of parliament, were ſo much offended, that they met at a tavern, and having appointed two lords and two commoners to wait, in their name, upon the Queen, they requeſted her permiſſion for bringing in a bill for the diſſolution of the Union<note n="I" place="bottom">MSS paſſim.</note>.</p>

Several of the Jacobite part of the Tories entered with eagerneſs into a meaſure, which was well calculated to diſtreſs the Earl of Oxford. The Whigs, for the like reaſon, were ready to throw their weight into the ſame ſcale. But the perſon who ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the whole oppoſition, on this ſubject, was the Duke of Argyle. This nobleman, eſpouſing the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

or paſſions of his family, had uniformly profeſſed his attachment to the Proteſtant ſucceſſion, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent averſion to a miniſter who was deemed to favour the Pretender. Careleſs and eager in his diſpoſition, he neither concealed his reſentment nor diſguiſed his deſigns. With a commanding manner, which ſtamped his very forwardneſs with an appearance of authority, he was feared by many, but beloved by none. Brave in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but not remarkable for his conduct, he might be conſidered, in his military capacity, as a bold partizan, rather than a judicious commander. In his civil cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, his fire degenerated into a violence, that often defeated his views. In his public exhibitions in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was rather ſpirited than eloquent; better calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to terrify his enemies, than to ſupport his friends. His great defect was a love of money and emolument, which he could not effectually conceal, with all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his pride<note n="J" place="bottom">Hannover and Stuart-papers, 1713.</note>. His chief talent was an addreſs in managing the prejudices of the vulgar. He marked their opinions as they changed, and fell dextrouſly down with the tide.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Motion for diſſolving the Union</note> The Earl of Oxford, no ſtranger to the importance of the Duke of Argyle, had reſolved to gain him by promiſes of advantage.

But the Duke declined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the views of the miniſter, till he ſhould obtain the office of maſter-general of the ordnance, vacant by the death of the Duke of Hamilton, The lord-treaſurer was unwilling to truſt a place of ſuch importance in the hands of a man whom intereſt only could gain to his ſide. Diſappointment heightened the Duke's reſentment. He reſolved to gain by force what he could not obtain by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. He oppoſed the court with vehemence. He treated the miniſter with inſult. He therefore entered, with great zeal, into the counſels of his countrymen, for the diſſolution of the union between the two kingdoms. To carry a point of ſuch great importance, was likely to introduce a confuſion into the meaſures of government, that would prove fatal to the power of the Earl of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.

The reſentment of the moſt violent Jacobites kept pace with the warmth and vehemence of the Whigs. Both reſolved to ruin the lord-treaſurer, as each looked upon him in the light of an enemy.

                  <note place="margin">rejected by a ſmall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority.</note> On the firſt of June, the Earl of Finlater, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, in the houſe of lords, the various grievances reſulting to the Scotiſh nation from the Union, concluded with a motion for diſſolving that treaty. Finlater was ſeconded by the Earl of Mar. The debate became gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral on this important ſubject. But the force of argument was leſs apparent, on both ſides, than the irreconcilable ſpirit of the two parties. The violence of Argyle againſt the Earl of Oxford was ultimately ſerviceable to that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, at the ſame time that it contributed to defeat his own deſigns. The Duke having, in the courſe of the debate, mentioned, with the utmoſt contempt, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, offended ſome lords, who ſecretly favoured his cauſe. Though they were willing to humble the Earl of Oxford, they were averſe from the principles of his more open enemies. Two biſhops, in particular, who poſſeſſed, between them, three proxies, by quitting the houſe<note n="M" place="bottom">MSS. paſſim, 1713.</note>, carried five votes from the Scots and Whigs. When the queſtion for bringing in the bill was put, it was carried in the negative, by a majority of four voices. A circumſtance, which preſerved the kingdom from confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was highly favourable to the Earl of Oxford. Had the motion been carried in the affirmative, it was to have been followed by another, for ſending the treaſurer to the Tower<note n="N" place="bottom">Ibid. Hannover and Stuart-papers, 1713.</note>. The Scots, diſappointed by their want of ſucceſs, and incenſed by the ſpeech of Argyle, fell again into the views of the court. Thus, the precipitate zeal of one of their own number prevented the Whigs from regaining the power that had been ſo long the ſole object of their intrigues and deſire.</p>

He ſaw that he was hated by the Tories, at the ſame time that
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:0709200302:566"/>
he was proſcribed by the Whigs. The irreconcilable ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity of the two parties had been hitherto the only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his power. The predominancy of either was to him alike deſtructive. His prudence was now in arms againſt his principles. The moſt direct way to preſerve his authority, was to gratify the more violent Tories, by abetting the views of the Pretender. But even that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious path was beſet with difficulties and dangers. Should his meaſures aſſume the appearance of Jacobitiſm, the jealouſy of the people againſt Popery might throw them into the ſcale of the Whigs. To retain the favour of the populace, was now as neceſſary as to regain the ſupport of the Tories. He had, therefore, recourſe to the old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient of giving private aſſurances to the Jacobites, while he marked his public conduct with a zeal for the houſe of Hannover. Though this artifice was too ſtale to deceive the Tories, the Whigs ſhewed ſuch an intemperate joy for their ſucceſs in the affair of the treaty of commerce, that the former reſolved to ſupport a miniſter they hated, to exclude a party whom they had great reaſon to fear<note n="O" place="bottom">MSS. paſſim.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Proceedings of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Impreſſed with this opinion, ſuch Tories as had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the treaty of commerce endeavoured to give a proof of their reſolution to change their conduct. Sir Thomas Hanmer, by whoſe influence the bill was rejected, moved for a palliative addreſs to the Queen, approving of the treaties of peace and commerce. His motion was carried by a great majority<note n="P" place="bottom">156 againſt 72.</note>. The Queen's anſwer was full of art and addreſs. She thanked the commons for their approbation of the treaty of commerce. She ſtated its advantages, and the great difficulties with which it had been obtained. The treaſurer, by this victory over his enemies, became more important in the eyes of his party and ſuppoſed friends. He reſolved to profit by their zeal. On the twenty-fifth of June, a meſſage from the Queen was preſented to the commons, by the chancellor of the Exchequer. This meſſage imported, that the civil liſt, prior to the year 1710, when the late changes in the miniſtry happened, had run greatly in arrear. That her Majeſty, therefore, requeſted the houſe to enable her to raiſe a ſum ſufficient to pay her debts upon the funds of the civil liſt. As the meſſage contained a kind of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

upon the former miniſtry, the conſequent motion was oppoſed with great vehemence by the Whigs. But they found, upon this occaſion, that their late triumphs were not owing to themſelves. A bill, empowering the Queen to raiſe five hundred and ten thouſand pounds, for the payment of the debts of the civil liſt, paſſed the houſe, by a great majority. The Whigs complained, that advantage had been taken of the abſence of many of their party, who had retired into the country when the buſineſs of the treaty of commerce was finiſhed<note n="Q" place="bottom">Journals.

She expreſſed how ſenſible ſhe was of the affection, zeal, and duty of the commons. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted their former ſervices. She enlarged upon their late favours. She acknowledged her gratitude for their having furniſhed her with ſupplies for continuing the war, and for ſtrengthening her hands in obtaining peace. She ſaid, that at her coming to the crown, ſhe found a war prepared to her hands. That God had bleſſed her arms with many victories in that war, which ſhe had improved, by procuring an advantageous and honourable peace. She requeſted her parliament to make the people ſenſible of what they had gained by the late treaties. She entreated them to remove the groundleſs jealouſies, which had been ſo induſtriouſly raiſed; to prevent all unhappy diviſions, that might not only weaken but even endanger the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which ſhe had obtained for her kingdoms. <q rend="inline">"There are ſome, very few, I hope,"</q> ſhe ſaid, <q rend="inline">"who will never be ſatisfied with any government.

The Viſcount Bolingbroke, who had, from the beginning, traverſed his meaſures, had long fixed his eyes upon his power.

They had repreſented, in the ſtrongeſt and moſt deciſive terms, that the Queen and her ſervants were irrecoverably attached to the Pretender. They threw his Highneſs, in the affair of the Succeſſion, into a deſpondence, that degenerated into a kind of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. He became careleſs and indifferent about a throne, which was repreſented ſo difficult to aſcend. To humour, however, thoſe who called themſelves his friends, he agreed, at length, to ſend his brother, Duke Erneſt, to Great Britain. The Whigs, diſappointed by this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, formed an opinion, that his Highneſs was jealous of the influence which might be acquired by his ſon, in Great Britain.

His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs having poſitively declared, that he would not riſk an expedition into Britain in a hoſtile manner, prior to the Queen's death, his miniſters had begun to take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions in expectation of that event. They had ſent, early in the year, ſeveral queries to the leaders of the Whigs. The anſwers which were to form the line of their conduct, were given, by the lords Somers, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Halifax. They declared, that no commiſſion,

The Duke of Marlborough and General Cado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, who ſignified their inclination to have the eventual command of the troops, were not ſo ſcrupulous. They declared, that a writing in French, without any adherence to forms, would be ſufficient. That the authority of the Duke of Marlborough was ſo great among the ſoldiers, that any piece of parchment was enough to enſure their obedience to his command. As for Cadogan, he wiſhed only for a ſhow of authority to take poſſeſſion of the Tower, or to place himſelf in conjunction with the Electoral Prince at the head of the Britiſh troops, that ſtill lay in garriſon in ſome cities in Flanders<note n="B" place="bottom">Hannover papers paſſim, 1713.</note>.</p>

They had perpetually teazed his Highneſs for money to political writers and for ſpies planted round the Pretender. Though their ſolicitations on theſe ſubjects had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with little ſucceſs, they continued to make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the ſame diſagreeable kind. When the ſeſſion was drawing to a concluſion and a diſſolution was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, they demanded one hundred thouſand pounds from the Elector, to corrupt boroughs, to influence the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to return men of conſtitutional and Whiggiſh principles to the enſuing parliament<note n="C" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the ſum left no room for heſitation in rejecting their requeſt. One repulſe, however, was not ſufficient either to intimidate or diſcourage a party ſo eager in the purſuit of their deſigns. They diminiſhed their demand to fifty thouſand pounds. The Elector plainly told them, that he could not ſpare the money. That he had done the greateſt ſervice, conſiſtent with his own particular ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and the ſtate of Europe in general, to the well affected in Great Britain.

Though he had declined to change his religion at the ſolicitation of his adherents, his ſervants were almoſt all of the Proteſtant perſuaſion. The Earl of Middleton, who had yielded to policy more than conviction, his former ſyſtem of faith, was the only Roman Catholic of any conſequence in his train<note n="E" place="bottom">Ibid. 1713.</note>. A clergyman of the church of England had come from Britain at his deſire, to exerciſe the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his order in his family<note n="F" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1713.</note>. In daily expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a change in his favour, he declined all correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, except ſuch as ſolely conveyed intelligence of the ſtate of opinions and the ſecret intrigues in government. The ſame diſtruſt of the lord treaſurer that prevailed at Hannover, was entertained, with much more reaſon, at Bar-le-duc. But both agreed in the opinion, that his own ſafety would, at length, induce the Earl of Oxford to throw himſelf in the ſcale of the Pretender. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents of that Prince placed, however, their greateſt hopes in the inclinations of Queen Anne. They knew that an interior cabinet was formed in oppoſition to the trimming conduct of the lord treaſurer. That Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, who had long hated that nobleman, had flattered the prejudices of the Queen and her favourite, to ruin the miniſter. That the latter had applied to the principal Whigs for protection againſt his colleagues in office<note n="G" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.

to the continuance of an unequal war. They inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated through the court of Hannover, that one of two events, very likely ſoon to ariſe, would turn the balance againſt the houſe of Bourbon. That, ſhould the Queen, already manifeſtly near her end, happen to die, the war would be inſtantly renewed by Great Britain, under the Electoral family. That, in caſe of the demiſe of Lewis the Fourteenth, who was now broken with infirmities and age, France, by falling under the dominion of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, would be rendered incapable to defend herſelf, and much leſs would ſhe be able to keep Philip the Fifth on the throne of Spain.

That to accompliſh this great deſign, nothing was neceſſary, but to remain on the defenſive, on the Rhine. That to make conqueſts was of much leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance than to maintain the ſhow of war; and, that even ſlight diſaſters might be of ſervice, as they would contribute to alarm the Britiſh nation, by the progreſs made by the arms of France<note n="I" place="bottom">Stuart and Hannover-papers, paſſim, 1713.</note>.</p>

Foreſeeing the event that deprived him of the aid of his allies, he had accommodated the differences which had long ſubſiſted between his family and the malecontents in Hungary. Preliminary articles, containing a general amneſty on both ſides, had been followed by a formal treaty. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ragotſki, diſappointed in his views, had fled to Poland, and twenty-two regiments of Hungarians, taking the oaths to the Emperor, paſſed into his army. The Prince of Savoy commanded the Imperialiſts. When he was making preparations for paſſing, with great caution, the Rhine, he was ſuddenly ſtopt, by the approach of a ſuperior force, under the Mareſchal de Villars. The French had acquired their uſual confidence, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the maritime powers from the grand confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.

Villars, having formed greater deſigns, forced the paſſage of the Rhine, attacked and defeated the General Vaubonne, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and took Fribourg, before the end of the campaign.

Each endeavoured, by their writers, to impoſe upon a credulous multitude. Poſitive aſſertions were advanced, according to cuſtom, as facts; and declamation was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the place of argument. The Whigs, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in their expectations of money from Hannover, had endeavoured to gain the mob of London, through their habitual prejudices againſt the French. The ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors from the Pretender were inculcated, in vain, againſt the poſitive aſſurances of the Queen, in favour of the Proteſtant ſucceſſion. The imprudence and inattention of the Duke d'Aumont, the French ambaſſador, had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the diſcontented with an opportunity of inflaming the populace againſt his nation, and conſequently againſt the miniſtry. To gain popularity, that miniſter had, upon his entrance into London, ſtrewed whole handfuls of ſilver coin among the rabble. Their acclamations end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his generoſity.

He drank, with an appearance of zeal, to the pious memory of King William; though it is well known he deſerted the cauſe of that Prince when alive. On the anniverſary of King William's birth-day, his Ducheſs, then in correſpondence with the excluded family, gave a magnificent ball, and flattered the principles of the Whigs upon the occaſion. The elections for members of a new parliament were, in the mean time, carried on with induſtry, contention, and animoſity. The two parties of Whigs and Tories, as in Great Britain oppoſed each other with violence, and even bloodſhed.

The new parliament, which was to have met on the twelfth of November, was further prorogued to the tenth of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.

With regard to the firſt, men, remarkable for the Tory prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, were placed in eminent ſtations, which had been rendered vacant by deaths, diſmiſſions, or removals.

The Duke, not remarkable for friendly attachments, ſeemed to have departed from the uſual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference of his character, with regard to the Viſcount Bolingbroke. He is ſaid to have declared, upon the death of the Marquis of Blandford, that he had now no comfort left in the world, except in Henry St. John, whom he regarded and loved as his own ſon<note n="A" place="bottom">MSS. paſſim.</note>.

When, therefore, the Duke was on the worſt terms with the court, he had a friend in the cabinet, who ſupported his intereſt when the current was not too ſtrong to be ſtemmed. When the dangerous intrigues of Marlborough, in the end of 1711, furniſhed the lord-treaſurer with an opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving him from all his employments, St. John yielded to the times, and approved of a meaſure which he could not oppoſe<note n="B" place="bottom">Original Papers, paſſim.</note>.</p>

He, however, retained, throughout the year 1712, his influence with his ſovereign, by finding means to perſuade that timid Princeſs, that he himſelf was neceſſary to her ſafety, againſt the dangerous deſigns of the Whigs. When time had expunged from her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory a part of her fears, ſhe began to liſten to the inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Bolingbroke againſt the treaſurer.

Having flattered her prejudices, by pretending to enter into her views, he gradually ſupplanted the influence of the lord-treaſurer. He repreſented the languor of his meaſures. He gave inſinuations concerning his ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues with the Whigs. The artifice which he uſed with the Queen, he employed, with equal ſucceſs, on the more violent Tories. In the beginning of the preſent year, he formed a ſerious deſign of placing himſelf at the head of a party, independent of the Earl of Oxford. But a well-grounded fear of the Whigs induced him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to adhere to the lord-treaſurer. He was, however, at the bottom of all the mortifications which that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſuffered, by the deſertion of ſome of the high-church party in the laſt ſeſſion of parliament. To humble his rival was ſuitable to his violent paſſions. To ruin him entirely, conſidering the times and his own precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſituation, was inconſiſtent with common prudence. His object was to ſtrengthen himſelf, with the return of the Duke of Marlborough. That nobleman would have no objection to join with any party, who ſhould contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the fall of his enemy, the Earl of Oxford<note n="G" place="bottom">MSS. paſſim. 1713</note>.

Theſe chidings, bearing the appearance of zeal, were neither regarded nor feared. In the mean time, Bolingbroke proceeded in his intrigues. He daily gained the ground which the unhappy manner of the treaſurer was deſtined to loſe. He had often complained to the Queen of his principles. He now loudly accuſed him of dilatorineſs and indolence. He affirmed, that, by neglecting the power which the influence of government had placed in his hands, he had permitted a greater number of Whigs, than was conſiſtent with the ſafety of government, to obtain ſeats in the houſe of commons<note n="I" place="bottom">Stuart-papers, 1713.</note>.</p>

To regain his former power, he ſeemed inclined to deſert his preſent friends. He was willing to govern Anne, by yielding to her prejudices. Under a certainty that ſhe was attached to her brother's intereſt, he endeavoured ſecretly to gain the confidence of the Pretender's adherents abroad. He wrote to the Ducheſs of Berwick. He even ſent a letter to the late King James's Queen. He diſpatched one of his retainers to France. He empowered him to convey the moſt ſolemn proteſtations of his attachment to the Chevalier de St. George. He aſſured him, with an oath, that he would rather cut off his own right-hand, than oppoſe his views on the throne. That, provided he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might be rendered ſecure, he would not heſitate a moment to uſe all his credit, both privately and publickly, for his ſervice. He inſtructed the Duke of Berwick, he ſaid, more largely on the ſubject; and he had reaſon to hope an anſwer ſuitable to his ſincerity and zeal<note n="K" place="bottom">Ibid. Oct. 1713.</note>. Theſe relentings of Marlborough, if they were at all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, were prevented from having any effect, by the fears of the Queen.

                  <note place="margin">Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the Whigs.</note> The terrors of the Queen for Marlborough proved a fatal blow to her own views. To ruin the treaſurer, by ſupporting himſelf with the prejudices of the ſovereign, the Duke might have probably deſerted the principles of the Whigs; which, like many of the party, he had only adopted to favour his own deſigns. But when he found that the Queen was obdurate, and that the Pretender him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf treated his propoſals with caution and even diſtruſt, he fell back with vehemence into his former profeſſions to the houſe of Hannover. He correſponded with that family. Without either ceremony or diſtinction, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the miniſtry of incurable Jacobitiſm; and in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral accuſation even involved his friend Bolingbroke. He was joined in theſe aſſurances by moſt of the leaders of the Whig-party. The Duke of Argyle, yielding to perſonal reſentment, affirmed to the envoy of Hannover, that he knew, from his own experience, the lord-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer was a falſe and deceitful man. That he exerted himſelf with all his might againſt the Proteſtant ſucceſſion. That he was reforming the army, to facilitate the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Pretender; and that even his friends acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, he was too far engaged to retreat. The Earl of Ilay extended his accuſations much further than his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Duke of Argyle. He aſſured the Hannoverian reſident, that the Preſbyterians were the only friends of the ſucceſſion of the Electoral family; and that all the members of the church of England, eſpecially in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, were Jacobites, without exception<note n="M" place="bottom">Hannover-papers.

A propoſal, made by the Baron de Bernſtorff, preſident of the Elector's council, was received by Marlborough and Cadogan with eagerneſs and joy. He inſinuated, that his Electoral Highneſs might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to borrow to the extent of twenty thouſand pounds from his friends in Britain. This ſum was to be laid out on the poor lords and the common-council of London, during the three years the parliament was to ſit.

A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made in the houſe of commons againſt a pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, written with great acrimony and boldneſs, charging the ſervants of the Queen with mal-adminiſtration; and aſſerting, in expreſs terms, that the Proteſtant ſucceſſion was in danger, through their machinations. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, though the work of a Mr. Moore<note n="I" place="bottom">MSS. paſſim.</note>, was aſcribed to Mr. Richard Steele, a name well known in the republic of letters.

The Queen, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, paid an equivalent, in money, to the diſmiſſed officers.

In this ſtate of doubt and uneaſineſs, they reſolved to make one other effort to gain the people, by awaking their fears.

They moved, that an addreſs ſhould be preſented to her Majeſty, on the ſubject of the removal of the Pretender from Lorrain, and on other points, calculated to raiſe the reſentment of the populace againſt the miniſtry. On this occaſion the Earl of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford made a motion, which ſeemed prepoſterous, as the motive was then unknown.

Such troops as ſhould attend that Prince, would have been open enemies, if foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and rebels, if natives.

Some ſhips of war were made ready for ſea, in their ports. Some troops, eſpecially the Scots in the ſervice, had received orders to march toward the coaſt. The Whigs at home were ready to ſecond the projected invaſion from abroad. A ſet of inferior conſpirators were prepared to ſupport with action the deliberations of their leaders. Meaſures were concerted, by a ſociety called the kit-cat club, to ſeize the Tower, to declare for the family of Hannover, to ſecure the perſons of ſuch as were ſuſpected of favouring the Pretender.

They moved, therefore, for an addreſs to her Majeſty, for renewing her inſtances with the Duke of Lorrain, to expel the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender from his dominions. An addition made to their motion, ſeemed levelled againſt the ſuſpected feelings of the Queen's mind. It was propoſed to requeſt her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to iſſue a proclamation, ſetting a price on her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's head. The Lord North and Grey, ſeconded by the Lord Trevor, oppoſed, with vehemence, this latter meaſure<note n="Y" place="bottom">April 8. 1714.</note>. They repreſented, that the motion was as inconſiſtent with common humanity, as it was repugnant to the Chriſtian religion. That, to ſet a price on any man's head, was to encourage aſſaſſination, by public au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. That, for their own parts, ſhould ever the caſe come before them, as peers and judges, they would think themſelves bound, in juſtice, honour, and conſcience, to condemn ſuch an action as murder. The Whigs argued upon the ground of expediency. But the Tory lords who had joined them, ſome days before, deſerted them on this occaſion. The biſhops, either from principle or decency, were averſe from this ſanguinary meaſure; and, upon a diviſion, the addition to the firſt motion was rejected<note n="Z" place="bottom">Journals, April 8.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Their fears ſuperfluous and vain.</note> The addreſs to the Queen was preſented only by a few Whig lords. Could a judgment be formed of the ſtate of things, from the conduct of parliament, one might ſuppoſe, that the nation was then in imminent danger.

by a formidable party at home. That his friends only waited for his arrival, to dethrone the Queen, and utterly extirpate all the Whigs in the kingdom. The contrary of all this was the truth. The French, who could only ſupport the Pretender, were unwilling to plunge into thoſe diſaſters from which they had been lately extricated by a ſpecies of miracle. Lewis the Fourteenth, never hearty in the cauſe of the excluded Stuarts, was now more averſe than ever from giving them any effectual ſupport. His ambition and his love of glory had vaniſhed with his power. He felt the decline of years. Though ſtill ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to live, he foreſaw his own approaching death. The proſpect of French affairs was gloomy, beyond that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. He was to leave the ſcepter in the hands of a ſickly infant, under the tuition of an unprincipled relation, who, from the very misfortunes of the late war, had perhaps extended his views to the crown.

The reſident, without any direct orders from his court, communicated his deſign to the lord-treaſurer, who had uniformly made the moſt violent, yet the leaſt effectual, profeſſions of his zeal for the Proteſtant line.

That this proceeded not only from the conſcience of his oaths, but out of a profound reſpect for their many virtues.

That thoſe whom ſhe truſted the moſt were the leaſt likely to adhere to her cauſe. That a miniſter, who derived his claim to her favour from his pretending to ſupport her meaſures, was making terms for himſelf with her political enemies.

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was calculated to prevent the growth of ſchiſm, in a manner deemed extremely ſevere, by the Diſſenters. This laſt bill furniſhed an ample field of conteſt for the two contending factions. It was ſaid to have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Bolingbroke to haraſs Oxford, who favoured the Diſſenters; and to gain to himſelf the ſupport and affection of the high-church party.

Foreigners, judging from the fears of the friends of the houſe of Hannover, formed no doubt of his ſpeedy reſtoration to the throne. They concluded, that his ſiſter was heartily in his intereſt: That her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were forming effectual ſchemes for ſecuring his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the crown. The Duke of Lorrain, gained by the ſoftneſs of his manners, touched with his misfortunes, or forming hopes upon his future proſpects, entered hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily into his cauſe. Perceiving the indifference of France, he endeavoured to gain the Imperial court to the intereſt of his gueſt. He even directed his envoy at the court of Vienna to aſk for him in marriage one of the daughters of the Emperor Joſeph. Charles the Sixth was ſo little offended at this requeſt, that the only objection he made was the diſparity in their age. The arch-dutcheſs was but twelve years old; but the Pretender was in his ſix and twentieth year. The Emperor recommended his own ſiſter, as a more ſuitable match. He, however, prudently obſerved, that the times were too critical to come to a determination on this head.

But, amidſt inſinuations of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, and, perhaps, profeſſions of zeal, they were betrayed into a meaſure, which might convince him, that his hopes from their favour were ill founded. An infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation having been obtained, by the vigilance of the Earl of Wharton, againſt ſome Iriſh officers, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted men for the Pretender, they were ſeized by a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Queen's Bench.

The diſcovery made by Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton having fallen under the deliberation of the cabinet-council, it was carried by a majority of votes, that a proclamation ſhould be iſſued againſt the Pretender.

He encouraged an addreſs to the Queen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting her Majeſty to apply to the uſe of the public her part of the profits of the aſſiento contract. Bolingbroke dictated an anſwer, that gave great offence to the lords. Neither he nor the Lady Maſham could forgive the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer for a meaſure, which in hurting their intereſt, had deeply wounded their pride.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</note> This incident haſtened the fall of the treaſurer. But it was far from being the ſole cauſe of his diſgrace. Though Bolingbroke had failed in his project of bringing Marlborough into office, in the preceding winter, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſt ſight of that object. During the whole ſeſſion, he is ſaid to have held a correſpondence with the Duke, whoſe only objection to the preſent men and meaſures was an irreconcilable averſion to the Earl of Oxford. That miniſter, by his ſuggeſting no difficulties in any meaſure, was a ſervant calculated to pleaſe a weak ſovereign, that was always haunted by political fears. He had, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, obtained a dominion over the Queen, which neither the arts of Bolingbroke nor the influence of Lady Maſham could remove. The demand of the writ, made by the envoy of the houſe of Hannover, was one of theſe few incidents that had raiſed any appearance of ſpirit in the mind of Anne. Bolingbroke had the addreſs to perſuade her, that this meaſure was privately promoted by the Earl of Oxford. His cabals with the Whigs, his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:0709200302:607"/>profeſſions to the Electoral family, his myſterious conduct, which ſhe had now, for the firſt time, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, confirmed the inſinuations of Bolingbroke. She, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, reſolved to diſmiſs a ſervant, whom ſhe could no longer conſider in the light of a friend<note n="G" place="bottom">MSS. paſſim.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Bolingbroke and Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</note> Bolingbroke, on the other hand, humoured the Queen in all her prejudices. He ſuggeſted to her, that to pay any attention for the future to the houſe of Hannover was incompatible with her ſervice<note n="H" place="bottom">Hannover-papers, July 20, 1714.</note>. Her reſentment had placed her in the ſcale of the Pretender, as far as ſhe was permitted by her own timidity and jealouſy. The principal object of Bolingbroke was to perpetuate his influence; that of Marlborough to regain his former power. The firſt knew that he could not ſupport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, after the removal of the lord-treaſurer. The latter had no objection to his entering into any meaſures, ſhould that miniſter be removed from the cabinet. The views of both were turned to their own intereſt. Should the Queen live and continue her favour for the Pretender, they would probably have paved his way to the throne. Should ſhe happen to die, before matters were ripe, the Duke had eſtabliſhed an intereſt with the family of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover, that might preſerve his friend. Though no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive proofs of their intrigues can be NOW produced, a probable conjecture may be made. They deſigned, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to ſerve the Pretender, by the means of Sweden. The ambaſſador of that kingdom made no ſecret of his expecting REAL aſſiſtance, through the means of Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, from the Britiſh court; and he openly expreſſed his wiſhes, that the Pretender were already arrived<note n="I" place="bottom">Ibid.

                  <note place="margin">Their views.</note> THE Duke of Marlborough, aſſured of the projected diſgrace of Oxford, haſtened to Oſtend, to embark. But he was detained there for a fortnight by contrary winds. In this interval of ſuſpence, the difficulty which Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke found in forming the ſhew of a miniſtry, was the cauſe of the delay in the treaſurer's fall. His own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was to continue ſecretary of ſtate to command all the foreign correſpondence. He was, however, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs Bromley, his colleague in office, and to place the ſeals in the hands of Sir William Wyndham. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury

But either ſome of theſe men declined the offices allotted for them, by Bolingbroke, or he himſelf became undeciſive, through the weight of his own power. He, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to remove the Earl of Oxford, and to truſt the reſt to fortune. On the twenty-ſeventh of July, when the treaſurer came to court, he was deprived of his ſtaff.

                  <note place="margin">Diſmiſſion and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</note> The character of the Earl of Oxford has been deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all its ſingularities as the incidents aroſe. But the throwing into one view its moſt ſtriking features, may give a more complete portrait of the man. The talents beſtowed upon him by nature were neither extenſive nor obvious; and theſe ſeem to have been little improved by education, though he has been called a patron of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and of learned men. His whole progreſs in literature was confined to that ſlight knowledge of the dead lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which men intended for public life generally bring from ſchool. He neither underſtood foreign lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, nor wrote, with any degree of elegance, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tongue. In the diſpoſition of his mind he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, diſtruſtful and cold. A lover of ſecrecy to ſuch a degree, that he aſſumed its appearance in mere trifles; fond of importance, without any dignity of manner; ſo full of profeſſions, that he was always deemed inſincere. In his public meaſures he was rather tenacious of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than either firm or reſolute in his conduct: yet much more deciſive in the means of annoying his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than in thoſe calculated to gratify his friends. With a facility of temper that could deny no requeſt, but with a defect of mind that could beſtow nothing with grace, he offended the diſappointed, and even loſt thoſe whom he ſerved. The diſpoſal of offices, which gives influence to other miniſters, was a real misfortune to the Earl of Oxford. He often promiſed the ſame place to five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at once; and created ſour enemies, without making the fifth his friend.</p>

buſineſs, he was not ſubject to perſonal fear. Though thoroughly ambitious, he was a ſtranger to haughtineſs and pride. Though perſevering in his oppoſition to his enemies, he was not in his temper revengeful; and though he made no ſcruple to tempt the honeſty of others, with money, he himſelf cannot be accuſed, with juſtice, of the leaſt tincture of avarice. In his public meaſures he can never deſerve the character of a great miniſter. There was a narrowneſs of ſentiment, a vulgarity of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and even a meanneſs in his conduct, that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excited the contempt of his beſt friends. In his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intrigues for power, in his dextrous management of two parties, by whom he was equally hated, in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the fury of the Jacobites, in his amuſing the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of the Whigs, in his advancing the intereſts of the houſe of Hannover, when moſt diſtruſted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their adherents, he ſhewed a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of addreſs and political knowledge. The nation owed to a defect in Oxford's mind, a greater benefit, than they could have derived from a miniſter of more ſplendid talents. Had he been poſſeſſed of the pride in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from great parts, his reſentment for the ill uſage, which he experienced from the Whigs and the agents of the houſe of Hannover, might have induced him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the Proteſtant ſucceſſion, and bring about thoſe very evils of which he was unjuſtly accuſed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> In a country where freedom prevails, extenſive talents are far from being the neareſt path to the poſſeſſion of power. Their prior condition muſt place mankind in the line of preterment; otherwiſe their abilities, inſtead of being employed by the ſtate, become, through want of uſe, a burden to themſelves. The moſt intelligent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, at the head of a popular government, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely circumſcribed in the choice of his ſervants. He muſt rule his people through the medium of perſons whom ſome accident, independent of themſelves, have fixed in a certain rank in the community. But, as the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which ſavour ambition, are enemies to the toil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for improving and enlarging the mind, men fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently come to the management of the concerns of a great kingdom, with abilities ſcarce ſufficient to regulate the affairs of a private family. Hence, and not from a dearth of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, proceed the confined ſyſtems, the vulgar policy,

the uniform undeciſiveneſs of public councils. A miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, inſtead of moving the whole machine of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuffers himſelf to be carried forward by its inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent motion; and ſhould no accidents happen, the praiſe muſt be given to fortune. Theſe obſervations may be applied, with a degree of juſtice, to the Earl of Oxford; who carried into his public conduct, all the narrowneſs of his private character.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Conſuſion in the cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</note> Though the Viſcount Bolingbroke had the addreſs to remove the lord-treaſurer, he was not able to ſeize the reins which he had ſtruck from his hands. Wild, viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and vehement, in all his projects, he had not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen difficulties, or he was found incapable to ſurmount them, when they came. During three days of anarchy and confuſion in the cabinet, the minds of men were agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with the viciſſitudes of hopes and fear. The Queen herſelf, in a dangerous ſtate of health before, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the violence of her diſtemper, by the agitation of her ſpirits. Having aſſiſted at a council of her principal ſervants, in the night of the twenty-ninth of July, ſhe became perplexed, beyond meaſure, at their differences in opinion, and want of deciſion. The uſual diſcharge, from an impoſthumation in her leg, was ſtopped. <note place="margin">Aug. 1. Death of the Queen.</note> The gouty matter, tranſlating itſelf to the brain, threw her into a dozing inſenſibility, in which ſhe expired, at Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington, on Sunday the firſt of Auguſt, about ſeven of the clock in the morning. In a tranſient interval of her lethargy, ſhe delivered the treaſurer's ſtaff to the Duke of Shrewſbury, who had been recommended to that high office by ſuch of the privy council as were aſſembled, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion, at Kenſington.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Her perſon and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> Thus died Anne Stuart, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, in the fiftieth year of her age and thirteenth of her reign. In the perſon ſhe was of a middle ſtature, and before ſhe bore children well-made. Her hair was dark, her complexion ſanguine, her features ſtrong, but not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, her whole countenance more dignified than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. In the accompliſhments of the mind, as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe was not deficient. She underſtood muſic: She loved painting: She had even ſome taſſe for works of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. She was always generous, ſometimes liberal, but never profuſe. Like the reſt of her family, ſhe was good-natured,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:0709200302:613"/>
to a degree of weakneſs. Indolent in her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, timid by nature, devoted to the company of her favourites, eaſily led. She poſſeſſed all the virtues of her father, except political courage. She was ſubject to all his weakneſſes, except enthuſiaſm in religion. She was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her authority, and ſullenly irreconcilable toward thoſe who treated either herſelf or her prerogative with diſreſpect. But, like him alſo, ſhe was much better qualified to diſcharge the duties of a private life, than to act the part of a ſovereign. As a friend, a mother, a wife, ſhe deſerved every praiſe. Her conduct, as a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, could ſcarcely be excuſed by a virtue much ſuperior to all theſe. Upon the whole, though her reign was crowded with great events, ſhe cannot, with any juſtice, be called a great Princeſs. Subject to terror, beyond the conſtitutional timidity of her ſex, ſhe was altogether inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of deciſive councils; and nothing, but her irreſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible popularity could have ſupported her authority, amidſt the ferment of thoſe diſtracted times.</p>
