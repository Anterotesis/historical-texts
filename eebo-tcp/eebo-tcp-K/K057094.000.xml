            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF Archbiſhop ABBOT.</head>
            <p>GEORGE ABBOT, was born October 29th, 1562, at Guildford, in Surrey, of very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy parents, remarkably diſtinguiſhed by their ſteady zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, for their living long, and happily together, and for their ſingular felicity in their children.<note n="a" place="bottom">Mr. Maurice Abbot, was by trade a Clothworker, and ſettled at the town of Guildford, in Surrey, where he married his wife Alice March, and ſuffered for his ſtedfaſtneſs in the Proteſtant Religion, through the means of Dr. Story, who was a great perſecutor of ſuch perſons in the reign of Queen Mary. But theſe ſtorms being blown over, they paſſed the remainder of their days quietly, living together fifty-eight years. She deceaſed September 15, 1606, and he September 25, the ſame year, the former being eighty, and the latter eighty-ſix years of age. They left behind them ſix ſons, of whom Robert the eldeſt, was then one of the King's chaplains, George, had been thrice vice-chancellor of Oxford, and their youngeſt ſon Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, was at this time an eminent merchant of the city of London.</note>
            </p>
            <p>While his mother was pregnant with this ſon, ſhe is ſaid to have had a dream which proved at once an omen, and an inſtrument of his future fortunes. Her dream was this. She fancied ſhe was told in her
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0466800400:6"/>
ſleep that if ſhe could eat a Jack, or Pike, the child ſhe went with would prove a ſon, and riſe to great preferment. Not long after this, in taking a pail of water out of the river Wey, which ran by their houſe, ſhe accidentally caught a Jack, and had thus, an odd opportunity of fulfilling her dream. This ſtory being much talked of, and coming to the ears of ſome perſons of diſtinction, they offered to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſponſors for the child, which was kindly accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they had the goodneſs to afford many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their affection to their godſon while at ſchool, and after he was ſent to the univerſity. Such was the good effects of his mother's dream.</p>
            <p>When he was grown up to an age proper for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the firſt tincture of learning, he was ſent with his elder brother Robert to the free ſchool, erected in their native town of Guildford, by K. Edward VI; and having paſſed thro' the rudiments of Literature, under the care of Mr. Francis Taylor, who had then the direction of that ſchool, he was in 1578 removed to the univerſity of Oxford, and entered a ſtudent in Baliol College. On November the 29th, 1583, being then bachelor of arts, he was elected probationer fellow of his college; and afterwards proceeding in the faculty of arts, he entered into holy orders, and became a celebrated preacher in the univerſity. He commenced bachelor of divinity in 1593, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded doctor in that faculty, in May, 1597: and in the month of September, of the ſame year, he was elected maſter of Univerſity College. About this time it was, that the firſt differences began between him and Dr. Laud, which ſubſiſted as long as they lived, and was the cauſe of great uneaſineſs to both.

                  <p>The croſs at Cheapſide was taken down in the year 1600, in order to be repaired, and upon this occaſion, the citizens of London deſired the advice of both univerſities on this queſtion; Whether the ſaid croſs ſhould be re-erected or not? and Dr. Abbot, as vice-chancellor of Oxford, gave it as his opinion, that the crucifix with the dove upon it ſhould not be again ſet up, but approved rather of a pyramid, or ſome other matter of mere ornament, for the reaſons aſſigned in his letter. In this determination he acted conſiſtently with his own practice, when in his ſaid office he cauſed ſeveral ſuperſtitious pictures to be burnt at the market-place of Oxford, and among the reſt, one in which was the figure of God the Father, over a crucifix, ready to receive the Soul of Chriſt; and he profeſſes in this letter, that he was moved to ſuch proceedings by his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and experience. <floatingText type="letter">

                  <p>There is no point in which all the writers who mention this Prelate, more clearly agree, than in this, that his journey to Scotland, brought him into that height of favour with the King, which ſo ſuddenly raiſed him in little more than three years, from Dean of Wincheſter, to Archbiſhop of Canterbury; yet it has ſo fallen out, that hitherto, his tranſactions in Scotland have lain ſo much in the dark, that it is a very difficult thing to diſcern how he merited by them, ſo high a ſhare of the Royal favour. To explain therefore this hitherto untouched point, and ſet this matter in a clear light, ſhall be the buſineſs of this note, the rather becauſe it will ſhew how unjuſtly this great man has been charged with unfriendlineſs to the eſtabliſhment of the Church of England, and coldneſs in regard to the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy. King James had ſuffered ſo much before his acceſſion to the Crown of England, from the ſpirit and power of the Preſbyterians in Scotland, that he was greatly ſet on reſtoring the ancient form of government by Biſhops in that kingdom; the care of which was principally entruſted to the Earl of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, to whom Dr. Abbot was now chaplain. That noble Lord, who is by all writers allowed to have been both the wiſeſt and beſt man of all the favourites of that nation, had proceeded ſo far in this matter two years before, as to obtain an act for the reſtitution of the eſtates of Biſhops, but the Preſbyterians made ſo ſteady a reſiſtance, that the conſequences which were hoped from the reſtoring of that order, were in the utmoſt danger of being diſappointed.

The account given by the famous hiſtorian of the Church of Scotland, (David Calderwood) ſufficiently proves the truth of what has been aſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted. <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'About the end of June, (1608) ſays he, the Earl of Dunbar came from court, and with him two Engliſh Doctors, Abbot and Higgins.

But when he came to St. Andrews, Mr. Robert Howie, a man of a ſeditious and turbulent ſpirit, declaimed againſt the diſcipline and government of our Kirk; and then they utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their mind in plain terms: no order was taken with ſo manifeſt a breach, after the laſt conference. This was the policy of the aſpiring Biſhops, to cry peace, peace, and to crave ſilence of their oppoſites; when, in the mean time, they minded not to be ſilent themſelves, when they found occaſion.'</q> This very clearly proves, that it was by a kind and moderate, not a haughty and ſevere, behaviour, that the Engliſh doctor, as he calls Dean Abbot, won ſo much upon the Scots miniſters, as to bring them into a compliance with the King's deſires; ſo that in two years afterwards, the Lord High Treaſurer, Dunbar, who was entirely governed in this matter by the advice of his able chaplain, procured an act in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, by which it was provided. <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That the King ſhould have the Indiction (or calling) of all General Aſſemblies.

A large account of this affair was drawn up by the judge, and a narrative prefixed thereto, by Dr. Abbot, who had been eye-witneſs of all that paſſed, and this was publiſhed at London, in order to ſettle the minds of the people, with regard to that conſpiracy; which had hitherto been looked upon as a very myſterious affair, and about the reality of which there had been very great doubts.<note n="d" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <hi>There had been very great doubts.</hi>] It is a difficult thing to give a clear account of this matter, within the ſhort compaſs of a note; and yet the importance, as well as curioſity of the ſubject, very obſcurely treated by moſt of our hiſtorians, as well as its cloſe connection with the hiſtory of Dean Abbot's life, render it abſolutely neceſſary. The conſpiracy was framed by John, Earl of Gowry, ſon to that Earl of Gowry, who had been executed for ſurprizing the King's perſon at Ruthen Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, in 1584; and carried on with great diligence and ſeerecy. The Scheme was to invite the King, upon ſome pretence or other, to the Earl's houſe at Perth, and there to make ſure of him. This deſign was executed on Tueſday Auguſt 5, 1600, when the King was brought thither by Mr. Alexander Ruthen, brother to the Earl, accompanied by ſome perſons of quality, under pretence of ſeeing ſome chymical experiment; and for this purpoſe after dinner, being brought to a chamber at the top of the houſe, Mr. Alexander Ruthen ſhut the door, and ſuddenly fell to upbraiding the King with the death of his father, for which he was now to make ſatisfaction; and, after this ſpeech, left him for ſome time to the mercy of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, who refuſed to do that office, though Alexander return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had, if this man had not hindered him; but the King with much ſtruggling got at laſt to a window, and cried out ſo loud, that the lords and gentlemen of his retinue heard him, and came to his aſſiſtance; the Earl himſelf was killed by Sir Thomas Ereſkine, the captain of the King's guard, as he was going to help his brother, and Alexander Ruthen was diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Ramſay, one of the King's pages, who being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the houſe, came by the back-ſtairs time enough to preſerve his maſter. When the miniſters of Edinburgh were deſired to aſſemble the people, and give God thanks for this deliverance, they excuſed themſelves, as not acquainted with the particulars; and when they were preſſed only to make known to the people, that the King had eſcaped a great danger, and to excite them to thanksgiving:—they anſwered, that they were not very well ſatisfied, as to the truth of the matter; and that nothing was to be uttered in the pulpit, but that which might be ſpoke in faith. Upon this, the council order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Biſhop of Roſs to aſſemble the people, to declare the whole affair, and to make a prayer of thankſgiving, which was done accordingly. In November following, a parliament was held at Edinburgh, in which the eſtate of Gowry was confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, the whole family attainted; and the 5th of Auguſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by act of parliament, for a day of thankſgiving in all ſucceeding times. After King James's acceſſion to the throne of England, he appointed a weekly commemoration, by a Tueſday's ſermon at court: and now, on the execution of this Sprot, an account of his ſhare in the conſpiracy was publiſhed, with a preface to the reader, ſubſcribed by Dr. Abbot, and full as large as the account itſelf. As this little tract is become very ſcarce, it may not be amiſs to give ſome paſſages from it, in order to ſet this matter in a clearer light. <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'There are few in this iſland, ſays he, of any underſtanding, but have heard of the traiterous, and bloody attempt of the Earl Gowrie and his brother, againſt the perſon and life, of our moſt bleſſed Sovereign. Wherein albeit there were ſuch evidences, and arguments, as that any man who would have taken notice thereof, might have been ſufficiently informed therein, even at the very firſt, and afterward, by the clear depoſitions (for moſt pregnant circumſtances) and ample atteſtations of many perſons of honour, and quality; the parliament of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom took full knowledge thereof, and accordingly proceeded to the forfeiting of the whole eſtate of that Earl, and of his heirs for ever: yet ſome humorous men, whom in that reſpect, I may juſtly term unthankful unto God, and undutiful to their King, out of fond imaginations, or rather, if you will, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious ſuppoſitions of their own, did both at home and abroad, by whiſperings and ſecret buzzings into the ears of the people, (who were better perſuaded of them than indeed there was cauſe) employ their wits and tongues, to obſcure the truth of that matter, and to caſt an imputation where it was leaſt deſerved. Which, when God had permitted, for the ſpace of ſome years to ranckle and feſter in the bowels of thoſe who were the authors of it; the ſame God, in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at laſt meaning to cure them, if they would be cured, of that malady, diſcovered that in the ſame treaſon, although carried never ſo ſecretly, there were other confederates, of whom hitherto the world had taken no kind of knowledge. And albeit two of the perſons intereſted in that buſineſs, were lately dead, and departed unto far greater torment, than all the earth could lay upon them, (unleſs they died repentant) yet it was apprehended, that a third party remained, who had foreknowledge of that conſpiracy, and was able to utter much of the ſecrets of it: one George Sprot, a notary, inhabiting at Ayemouth, a place well known in that county. Which matter, or ſome part thereof, being made known to an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſon, [the Earl of Dunbar] a moſt faithful ſervant to His Majeſty: firſt, by ſome words that fell from Sprot himſelf, and afterwards, by ſome papers found upon him; it was ſo wiſely carried, and ſo prudently brought about, by the great care and diligence of that nobleman (God Almighty bleſſing the buſineſs) that ſo much was revealed, as followeth in this treatiſe, upon the acts to be ſeen, which are here ſet down at large, word for word, as they agree with the proceſs origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and other examinations, that ſuch as have been averſe, may at laſt receive ſatisfaction.

The ſight, and hearing whereof, wrought ſo forcible an impreſſion in thoſe perſons of honour, and learned men, who beheld him, that there was ſcarce any one of them, who could refrain tears in the place, as diverſe of themſelves that day did witneſs unto me.—After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being brought to the ſcaffold where he was to die, he uttered many things, among which, I obſerved theſe: He acknowledged to the people, that he was come thither to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer moſt deſervedly; that he had been an offender againſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, in very many reſpects; but that none of his ſins were ſo grievous unto him, as that, for which he muſt die; where in, notwithſtanding he was not an actor, but a conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only. That he was ingyred (involved) in it by the Laird of Raſtalrig, and his ſervant, the Laird of Bour, both which, he ſaid, were men that profeſſed not religion. Whereupon, he exhorted men to take heed, how they accompanied with ſuch as are not religious; becauſe, ſaid he, with ſuch as make not profeſſion of religion, there is no faith, no truth, no holding of their word, as himſelf had tried and found. But touching the treaſon, for the concealing whereof he was condemned, he added, that he was preſerved alive to open that ſecret myſtery which ſo long had lain hid. That God had kept him ſince that attempt of the Earl Gowrie, from very many dangers, but notedly from one, when being in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hazard of drowning, he was ſtrangely delivered; which, ſaid he, was God's work, that I might remain alive unto this happy and bleſſed day, that the truth 
might be made known. And now I 
confeſs my fault, to the ſhame of myſelf, and to the ſhame of the devil; but to the glory of God. And I do it not either for fear of death, or for any hope of life (for I have deſerved to die, and am unworthy to live) but becauſe it is the truth, which I ſhall ſeal with my blood. My fault, ſaith he, is ſo great, that if I had a thouſand lives, and could die ten thouſand deaths, yet I might not make ſatisfaction, that I ſhou'd conceal ſuch a treaſon againſt ſo gracious a King. Theſe, and the like words, when he had ſpoken upon one ſide of the ſcaffold, he turned him to the ſecond ſide, and afterward to the third (that all the people might hear) where he ſpake to the ſame purpoſe as formerly he had done.—And here, being told by the ſaid miniſters, and other perſons of quality, that being ſo near his departure out of the world, it concerned him to ſpeak nothing but the truth, and that upon the peril of his ſoul: he anſwered, that to the end that they ſhould know that he had ſpoken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the verity, and that his confeſſion was true in every reſpect, he would (at the laſt gaſp) give them ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent token for the confirmation of the ſame. Then fitting himſelf to the ladder, the executioner cometh to him, and as the manner is, aſking forgiveneſs of him; with all my heart, ſaith he, for you do but your office, and it is the thing I deſire; becauſe, ſuffering in my body, I ſhall in my ſoul be joyned to my Saviour. Aſcending up to the ladder, he deſired the people to ſing a pſalm with him, which they did with many a weeping eye. He named the 6th pſalm, and beginning, or taking it up himſelf, in every verſe or line thereof, he went before the people, ſinging both loud and tunably unto the very end. Then once again confirming and avowing his former confeſſion, he covered his own face, and, commending his ſoul to God, he was turned off the ladder; where hanging by the neck ſome little while, he three ſeveral times, gave a loud clap with his hands, that all the ſtanders-by might hear, which was the ſign or token (as it ſeemeth) which he a little before had ſaid, that he would give at the laſt gaſp, for the rati ication and avowing of thoſe things, which by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion he had ſo many times declared and delivered. Theſe things were done in the open ſight of the ſun, in the King's capital town, at the market-croſs in Edinburgh, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence oſ diverſe thouſands of all ſorts; of the nobility, of the clergy, of the gentry, of the burgeſſes, of women and children, myſelf, with the reſt of the Engliſh miniſters, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, and looking on, and giving God the glory, that after ſo long a ſpace as eight years and eight days (for ſo it was by juſt computation, after the attempt of Gowrie) he was pleaſed to give ſo noble a teſtimony unto that, which by ſome maligners, hath been ſecretly called in queſtion, without any ground or reaſon.

                     <hi>A very ſingular letter written by him to Dr. Abbot, upon this ſubject.</hi>] This Letter from the King, to Dr. Abbot, was firſt publiſhed on occaſion of the famous diſpute between Dr. Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, Dean of St. Paul's, and his adverſaries, on his taking the oaths to King William III, after ſome heſitation, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the defence of his conduct on (Biſhop) Overall's Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Book.

                           <p>I Cannot abſtain to give you my judgment of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the convocation, as you will call it; and both as <hi>rex in ſolio,</hi> and <hi>unus gregis in eccleſia,</hi> I am doubly concerned. My title to the crown, nobody calls in queſtion, but they that neither love you nor me, and you may gueſs whom I mean; all that you, and your brethren, have ſaid of a king in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion (for that word, I tell you, is no more, than that you make uſe of in your canon) concerns not me at all: I am the next heir, and the crown is mine by all rights you can name, but that of conqueſt; and Mr Solicitor, has ſufficiently expreſſed my own thoughts, concerning the nature of kingſhip; and concerning the nature of it, <hi>ut in mea perſona,</hi> and, I believe you were all of his opinion, at leaſt none of you ſaid any thing contrary to it, at the time he ſpoke to you from me: but you know all of you, as I think, that my reaſon of calling you together, was to give your judgments; how far a chriſtian, and a proteſtent King, may concur to affiſt his neighbours to ſhake off their obedience to their own ſovereign? Upon the account of oppreſſion, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or what elſe you like to name it. In the late Queen's time, this kingdom was very free in aſſiſting the Hollanders, both with arms and advice, and none of your coat ever told me, that any ſcrupled at it in her reign. Upon my coming to England, you may know that it came from ſome of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to raiſe ſcruples about this matter; and albeit, I have often told my mind concerning <hi>jus regium inſubditos,</hi> as in <hi>May</hi> laſt, in the ſtar chamber, upon the occaſion of Hales's pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; yet I never took any notice of theſe ſcruples, till the affairs of Spain and Holland forced me to it. All my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours call on me to concur in the treaty between Holland and Spain, and the honour of the nation will not ſuffer the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers to be abandoned, eſpecially after ſo much money and men ſpent in their quarrel; therefore, I was of the mind to call my clergy together, to ſatisfy not ſo much me, as the world about us, of the juſtneſs of my owning the Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at this time. This I needed not to have done, and you have ſorced me to ſay, I wiſh I had not; you have dipped too deep, in what all kings reſerve among the <hi>arcana imperii;</hi> and whatever averſion you may profeſs againſt God's being the author of ſin, you have ſtumbled upon the threſhold of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, in ſaying, upon the matter, that even tyranny is God's authority, and ſhould be remembered as ſuch. If the King of Spain ſhould return to claim his old pontifical right to my kingdom, you leave me to ſeek for others to fight for it, for you tell us upon the matter beforehand, his authority is God's authority, if he prevail.</p>
                           <p>Mr Doctor, I have no time to expreſs my mind further on this theory buſineſs; I ſhall give you my orders about it by Mr Solicitor, and until then, meddle no more in it, for they are edge tools; or rather like that weapon that is ſaid to cut with one edge, and cure with the other: I commit you to God's protection, good Dr. Abbot, and reſt</p>

King's produced, but in all probability it anſwered his majeſty's end in writing it, as it is an inconteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proof of the confidence he had in the perſon it was written to. At leaſt thus much is certain, that Dean Abbot, ſtood ſo high in the King's favour, that on the death of Dr Overton, Biſhop of Litchfield and Coventry, which happened the latter end of April, 1609, his majeſty thought of Dr. Abbot for his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and he was accordingly conſecrated Biſhop of thoſe united ſees, on December 3, in the ſame year.</p>
            <p>But this it ſeems did not appear in the King's eyes a ſufficient recompence, for the ſervices rendered him by ſo able a man; and therefore, before he had ſet a month in this biſhoprick, he was tranſlated to Lond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſee becoming void by the death of Dr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ravis, and he was accordingly removed thither on the 20th of January following. It was but a ſhort time that he poſſeſſed both theſe biſhopricks, and yet in that ſhort time, he ſo remarkably diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf by the diligent performance of his function, by conſtant preaching, and by expreſſing the utmoſt readineſs to promote learning, and learned men, that he obtained a general good character, as appears from ſeveral memorials of thoſe times<note n="f" place="bottom">
                  <hi>As appears from ſeveral memorials of thoſe times.</hi>] While he was Biſhop of Coventry and Litchfield, it appears, that he ſollicited Abp. Bancroft, to beſtow a prebend upon Dr. Thomas James, who was Sir Thomas Bodley's Librarian at Oxford. In the year 1610, Thomas Tiſdale, of Glimpton, in Oxfordſhire, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> bequeathed five thouſand pounds to Dr. George Abbot, then Biſhop of London, Sir John Bennet, and Dr. Aray, to purchaſe lands for the maintainance of ſeven fellows and ſix ſcholars; which money was laid out in the purchaſe of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty pounds a year. Afterwards, Richard Wightwick, B. D. rector of Eaſt-Iſle, in Berkſhire, gave lands to the yearly value of one hundred pounds, for the maintenance of three fellows, and four ſcholars; upon which, the truſtees before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, having repaired, and, in a manner, rebuilt Broad-Gate-Hall, in Oxford, procured in the reign of King James, upon their petition ſetting forth theſe facts, a charter of Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, for ſeven hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> to this new founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was called Pembroke College, in reſpect to William, Earl of Pembroke, then Chancellor of the Univerſity; and for our Prelate's activity in accompliſhing this affair, Dr. Thomas Clayton, who was the firſt maſter of the new college, wrote him a very handſome letter of acknowledgement, which is ſtill extant. See Ward's Lives of the Profeſſors of Greſham Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, fol. 1740. p. 210. in Auguſt, 1610, he conſecrated the new church-yard, on the weſt ſide of Fleet-Ditch, the around of which had been given to the inhabitants of St. Bride's pariſh, by the Earl of Dorſet. His zeal, and indefatigable diligence, in the publick exerciſe of his function, were ſo remarkable, and the conduct of his private life ſo exemplary, as well as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable, that we find him celebrated by an eminent poet. [J. Davis of Hereford, in his Scourge of Folly, &amp;c. in honour of many noble and worthy Perſons,] for uniting the wiſdom of the ſerpent, with the innocency of the dove: which was not only true of him then, but in the whole ſucceeding courſe of his life; wherein it may be truly ſaid, that as his abilities raiſed him to preferment, ſo nothing but his rigid virtue and incorruptible probity, expoſed him to thoſe ſtorms of envy and malice, which, however they might affect his fortune, could never ſhake his conſtancy or prejudice his reputation.</note>.</p>

While the good Biſhop was thus employed, a new opportunity offered of the King's teſtifying his eſteem of, and confidence in, this worthy perſon, by the Archiepiſcopal See of Canterbury's becoming vacant as it did, on the 2d of November, 1610, by the death of Dr. Richard Bancroft.</p>
            <p>The court Biſhops immmediately caſt their eyes upon the celebrated Dr. Lancelot Andrews, then Biſhop of Ely, and pointed him out to the King, as one ſufficiently qualified to take upon him the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church; and they thought this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0466800400:21"/>
joined to the King's known regard for the parts and piety of this eminent man, enough to ſecure his promotion to the Primacy; but either the King himſelf thought of the Biſhop of London, or he was propoſed to him by his old friend and patron, the Earl of Dunbar; and therefore, without taking the advice of thoſe prelates, his majeſty prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Biſhop Abbot to the throne of Canterbury, in which he was ſeated on the 9th of April, 1611; and on the 23d of June following, was ſworn of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's moſt honourable privy council.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee him, before he had arrived at the age of fifty, exalted to the higheſt dignity of the Church, and celebrated by one of his con-tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and a biſhop too, [Godwin] for his learning, eloquence, and indefatigable diligence in preaching and writing, notwithſtanding the great burthen that lay upon him, from the neceſſary attendance on the duties of his high office; eſpecially preſiding in the high commiſſion court, which ſat weekly at his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and his regular aſſiſting at council, which, while his health permitted, he never failed.</p>
            <p>At this time, he was in the higheſt favour both with Prince and people; and appears to have had a principal hand in all the great tranſactions in Church and State; he was never eſteemed exceſſively fond of power, or deſirous of carrying his Prerogative, as Primate of England, to an extraordinary height; yet as ſoon as he had taken poſſeſſion of the archbiſhoprick, he ſhewed a ſteady reſolution in the maintainance of the rights of the high commiſſion court, and would not ſubmit to Lord Coke's prohibitions.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe ſhewed his concern for the intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion abroad, by procuring his majeſty's application to the States General, againſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0466800400:22"/>
Conrade Vorſtius, whom they called to the Profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orſhip of Leyden; in which affair Sir Ralph Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood was employed: and when it was found diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to obtain from the States that ſatisfaction which the King deſired, his Grace, in conjunction with the Lord Treaſurer, Saliſbury, framed an expedient for contenting both parties.</p>
            <p>In all probability this alarmed ſome of the warm churchmen at home, who were by no means pleaſed with the King's diſcountenancing abroad, thoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which themſelves favoured in both univerſities; but, whatever their ſentiments upon this matter might be, Archbiſhop Abbot ſeems to have had as great concern for the Church, as any of them, when he thought it really in danger, as appears by a ſhort and plain letter of his to Sir Ralph Winwood, about one Mr. Amias, who had been appointed preacher in the Engliſh congregation at the Hague, of whom the Biſhop ſays, that he was a fit perſon to breed up the captains and ſoldiers there in mutiny and faction, and, conſequently, very unfit for his office.</p>
            <p>His great concern for the true intereſt of religion, made him a zealous promoter of the match between the Elector Palatine, and the Princeſs Elizabeth; and that Prince being here in the beginning of the year 1612, his Grace thought fit to invite the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that attended him to an entertainment, at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiſcopal palace at Lambeth, where, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invited and unexpected, the Elector himſelf reſorted, to ſhew his great reſpect for the Archbiſhop, and was ſo well pleaſed with his welcome, that when he feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the members of the privy council at Eſſex Houſe, he ſhewed particular reſpect to the Archbiſhop, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>To the cauſes of that diſcontent, with which he left Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>] The Prince Elector Palatine, a little before he left Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, addreſſed himſelf to the King, in hopes of obtaining the enlargement of the Lord Gray, who had been a long time a priſoner in the tower; but this application ſo little pleaſed the King, that he told him roundly in anſwer, he marvelled, how he ſhould become a ſuitor for a man whom he neither knew, or ever ſaw; to which the Prince Elector anſwered, that this was true, but that he was recommended to him by his uncles, the Duke de Bouillon, Prince Maurice of Naſſau, and Count Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who were well acquainted with him. In all probability, this, inſtead of giving the King ſatisfaction, filled him with new apprehenſions; for his reply was in a very quick ſtile, Son, ſaid he, when I come into Germany, I promiſe you not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune you for any of your priſoners. This was ſo far from operating favourably in behalf of Lord Gray, that he was ſoon after more cloſely reſtrained, upon pretence of ſome private converſation he had with one of Lady Arabella's women, which proved after all to be no more than an amorous intrigue.

The concern his majeſty had ſhewn for removing Arminius firſt, and then Vorſtius, had given their favourers in Holland ſo much uneaſineſs, that the famous Hugo Grotius, the great champion of their cauſe, was ſent over to England, to endeavour to mitigate the King's diſpleaſure, and if poſſible, to give him a better opinion of the Remonſtrants, as they began then to be called; and we have a very ſingular account of the man, and of his negotiation, from the pen of the Archbiſhop<note n="h" place="bottom">

                              </gap>bon, (as I think) my Lord intreated him to ſtay to ſupper, which he did. There was preſent Dr Steward, and another Civilian, unto whom he flings out ſome queſtion of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and was ſo full of words, that Dr Steward afterwards told my Lord, that he did perceive by him, that, like a ſmatterer, he had ſtudied ſome two or three queſtions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when he came in company he muſt be talking to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his ſkill; but if he were put from thoſe, he would ſhew himſelf but a ſimple fellow. There was preſent alſo, Dr Richardſon, the King's profeſſor of divinity in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and another Doctor in that faculty, with whom he falleth in alſo about ſome of thoſe queſtions, which are now controverted among the miniſters in Holland. And being matters wherein he was ſtudied, he uttered all his ſkill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them: my Lord of Ely ſitting ſtill at the ſupper all the while, and wondering what a man he had there, who never being in the place or company before, could over-whelm them ſo with talk for ſo long a time. I write this unto you ſo largely, that you may know the diſpoſition of the man, and how kindly he uſed my Lord of Ely, for his good entertainment.—You will aſk me what is this to you? I muſt tell you therefore, that you ſhall not be without your part. At the ſame time that Sir Noel Caron was together with Grotius, being now to take his leave of the King, it was deſired of his majeſty, that he would not haſtily give his judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning points of religion, now in difference in Holland, for that his majeſty had information but of one ſide, and that his Ambaſſador did deal partially, making all reports in favour of the one ſide, and ſaying nothing at all for the other. For he might have let his majeſty know, how factious a generation theſe contradicters are; how they are like to our Puritans in England; how refractory they are to the author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the civil magiſtrate, and other things of like nature, as I wrote you in my former letter. I doubt not but Grotius had his part in this information, whereout I conceive you will make ſome uſe, keeping theſe things privately to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as becometh a man of your employment. When his majeſty told me this, I gave ſuch an anſwer as was ſit; and now upon the receipt of your letters, ſhall upon the firſt occaſion give further ſatisfaction.

as no doubt it did, great ſatisfaction, an affair that happened about the ſame time, diſturbed him not a little.</p>
            <p>This was the famous caſe of divorce between the Lady Frances Howard, daughter to the Earl of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, and Robert, Earl of Eſſex, her huſband; which has been always conſidered as one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt blemiſhes of King James's reign, though the part acted therein by the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, added much to the reputation he had already acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for unſhaken and incorruptible integrity.<note n="i" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Unſhaken and incorruptible integrity.</hi>] This affair of the divorce, was by the King referred to a court of delegates, conſiſting of his Grace the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, the Biſhops of London, Wincheſter, Coventry and Litchfield, and Rocheſter, Sir Julius Caeſar, Sir Thomas Parrey, Sir Daniel Dunn, Dr John Bennet, Dr Francis James, and Dr Thomas Edwards. This affair was drawn out into a great length, and many accidents happened in the courſe of it, which gave the Archbiſhop infinite diſquiet. He ſaw plainly, that the King was very deſirous the Lady ſhould be divorced, and, on the other hand, he was in his judgment directly againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. He laboured all he could to extricate himſelf from theſe difficulties, by having an end put to the cauſe ſome other way than by ſentence, but it was to no purpoſe; for thoſe who drove on this affair, had got too great power to be reſtrained from bringing it to the concluſion they deſired. The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was told, that a predeceſſor of his, which was Archbiſhop Grindall, had ſuffered about Dr. Julio's divorce, and ſo might he; but this, however, did not at all move him; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he prepared a ſpeech againſt the nullity of the marriage, which he intended to have ſpoken in the court at Lambeth, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 25, 1613, but he did not make uſe of that ſpeech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King ordered them to deliver their opinions in few words.

                  <p>To juſtify his conduct in this matter, the Archbiſhop drew up the reaſons which induced him to be againſt the ſentence, which King James thought fit to anſwer himſelf, and wrote alſo a letter to him upon that ſubject, in which there are ſome things that are very ſingular, and therefore worthy the reader's notice. <floatingText type="letter">

                           <p rend="margSglQuotes">After that I had fully peruſed and rightly conſidered of all your papers, I found your principles ſo ſtrange, and your doubts ſo far ſought, that I thought it neceſſary, as I have already ſaid, to ſet down unto you my obſervations upon them. But to conclude my letter with that plainneſs that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh one of my quality; I muſt freely confeſs, that I find the grounds of your oppoſition ſo weak, as I have reaſon to apprehend, that the prejudice you have of the perſons, is the greateſt motive of breeding theſe doubts into you; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice is the moſt dangerous thing that can fall in a Judge, for miſleading of his mind. And the reaſon moving me to this apprehenſion, is partly grounded upon your laſt words to me at your parting from Windſor, and partly upon a line
ſcraped out in your paper of doubts, for I am ſure you think me not ſo blunt a ſecretary, but that I can read a line ſo ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out. In your laſt ſpeeches with me, you remember you told me, what aſſurance you had of the Earl's ability out of his own mouth, which you ſaid you could not but truſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſo religious a nobleman. But when I told you of the other party's contrary affirmation, you remember how you uſed the word of iniquity, and how far your interlined line ſeems to have a harmony with this word, yourſelf can beſt judge. Now then if I would aſk you what proof you have of the one's religion more than the other's, you muſt anſwer me by judging upon the exterior; and how deceivable that gueſs is, daily experience teaches us: but with a holy proteſtation, that I never knew any thing but good in the young Earl.

            <p>He made uſe of his intereſt with her majeſty, when all other applications had failed, to engage her to recommend Mr. George Villiers, ſo well known af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the world, to his majeſty's favour, for which at that time, the young man was ſo grateful as to call him father, and to deſire his advice as to his behaviour, which the Archbiſhop very freely

                  <p>
                     <hi>If he had always followed thoſe councils.</hi>] We have this very remarkable paſſage from the Archbiſhop's own pen, in the diſcourſe he wrote upon his diſgrace, under the reign of King Charles. In that diſcourſe he obſerves, that it was one of King James's maxims, to take no favourite but what was recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by his Queen, that if ſhe afterwards complained of this Dear One, he might anſwer, it is long of yourſelf, for you were the party that commended him unto me. Our old maſter, ſays the Archbiſhop, took delight ſtrangely in things of this nature. He ſays that Queen Anne was graciouſly pleaſed to give him more credit than ordinary, and therefore when others had ſollicited her in vain, he was applied to; but for ſome time her majeſty would not liſten to his perſuaſions, or think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending Villiers, for which ſhe often gave him thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. My Lord, you and the reſt of your friends know not what you do, I know your maſter better than you all, for if this young man be once brought in, the firſt perſons that he will plague muſt be you that labour for him, yea, I ſhall have my part alfo; the King will teach him to deſpiſe and hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat us all, that he may ſeem to be beholden to none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Noble Queen (cries out the Archbiſhop after reporting this fact) how like a propheteſs did you ſpeak! The reſt of the ſtory being but ſhort will appear beſt in the Archbiſhop's own words, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'In the end, ſays he, upon importunity, Queen Anne condeſcended, and ſo preſſed it with the King, that he aſſented thereunto; which was ſo ſtricken while the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when the King gave order to ſwear him of the bed-chamber, Somerſet, who was near, importuned the King with a meſſage, that he might only be ſworn a Groom;—but myſelf and others that were at the door, ſent to her majeſty that ſhe would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect her work, and cauſe him to be ſworn a Gentleman of the chamber. There is a lord or two living that had a hand in this atchievement; I diminiſh nothing of their praiſe for ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a work, but I know my own part beſt; and on the word of an honeſt man, I have reported nothing but truth. George went in with the King, but no ſooner he got looſe, but he came forth unto me in the privy-gallery, and there em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced me: he profeſſed that he was ſo infinitely bound unto me that all his life long he muſt honour me as his father. And now he did beſeech me that I would give ſome leſſons how he ſhould carry himſelf. When he earneſtly followed this chace, I told him I would give him three ſhort leſſons, if he would learn them. The firſt was, that daily upon his knees he ſhould pray to God to bleſs the King his maſter, and to give him (George) grace ſtudiouſly to ſerve and pleaſe him. The ſecond was, that he ſhould do all good offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the Queen, and between the King and the Prince. The third was, that he ſhould fill his maſter's ears with nothing but truth. I made him repeat theſe three things unto me, and then I would have him to acquaint the King with them, and to tell me when I met him again, what the King ſaid unto him. He promiſed me he would; and the morrow after, Mr. Thomas Murrey, the Prince's tutor, and I ſtanding together in the gallery at Whitehall, Sir George Villiers coming forth and drawing to us, he told Mr Murrey how much he was beholden unto me, and that I had given him certain Inſtructions, which I prayed him to rehearſe, as indifferently well he did before us; yea, and that he had acquainted the King with them, who ſaid, they were inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions worthy of an Archbiſhop to give to a young man. His countenance of thankfulneſs for a few days continued, but not long, either to me or any other of his well-wiſhers.

Towards the cloſe of the next year, the famous Antonio de Dominis, Archbiſhop of Spalato, took ſhelter here, from the perſecution with which he was threatened by the Pope, for diſcovering his diſlike both of the doctrine and diſcipline of the Church of Rome, and was very kindly received by his majeſty, who was pleaſed to order the Archbiſhop to entertain him, which he did with generous hoſpitality, till he was otherways provided for by the King.

however thought himſelf ſufficiently recompenced for the trouble given him in this affair by this ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's procuring for him the manuſcript of Father Paul's excellent hiſtory of the council of Trent.</p>
            <p>In the ſpring of the year 1618, <hi>viz.</hi> on the ſecond of March, our good Archbiſhop loſt his brother the Biſhop of Saliſbury, and before his grief was well over for ſo near a relation, he met with freſh diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances from the King's declaration for permitting ſports and paſtimes on the Lord's day, which was dated at Greenwich, May 24, 1618<note n="l" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King's declaration for permitting ſports and paſtimes.</hi>] The declaration runs thus, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That for his good people's lawful recreations his pleaſure was, that after the end of Divine Service, they ſhould not be diſturbed, letted, or diſcouraged, from any lawful recreations: ſuch as dancing, either men or women, archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or any other ſuch harmleſs recreations: nor from having of May-games, Whitſun-ales, or morrice-dances, and ſetting up of May-poles, or other ſports therewith uſed; ſo as the ſame be had in due and convenient time, without impediment or let of Divine Service: and that women ſhould have leave to carry ruſhes to the church, for the decoring of it, according to their old cuſtom: withal prohibiting all unlawful Games to be uſed on the Sundays only, as bear-baiting, bull-baiting, enterludes, and at all times, in the meaner ſort of people, by law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, bowling.'</q>
                  </p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>This declaration was ordered to be read in church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the Archbiſhop being accidentally at Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in Surrey when it came thither, had the courage to forbid it's being read, which however the King winked at, notwithſtanding there were ſome about him, who let no opportunity ſlip of irritating him againſt this prelate.</p>

October four commiſſioners, and amongſt them Dr Hall, Dean of Wincheſter, with whoſe health the climate of Holland diſagreeing, he returned, and Dr Goad, the Archbiſhop's chaplain, was ſent in his place.</p>
            <p>The end of this year proved as diſagreable to the Archbiſhop as it's beginning; in Autumn, the Queen, his gracious miſtreſs, falling ill of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, which, after a tedious ſickneſs, brought her to her end on the firſt of March following.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop himſelf began alſo to grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and finding himſelf leſs fit for the affairs of the world than he had been, reſolved, while he had ſtill ſtrength, to enter upon a great and good deſign, which he had long meditated as a teſtimony of affection to his native town of Guildford, where on the fifth of April, 1619, he laid the firſt ſtone of his hoſpital, and afterwards nobly endowed it; a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of which will be given.</p>

                           <p>But for the matter; my humble advice is, that there is no going back, but a countenancing of it againſt all the world; yea ſo far as with ringing of bells and making of bonſires in London, ſo ſoon as it ſhall be certainly underſtood, that the coronation is paſt, I am ſatisfied in my conſcience that the cauſe is juſt, wherefore they have rejected that proud and bloody man; and ſo much the rather, becauſe he hath taken a courſe to make that kingdom not elective, but to take it from the donation of another man.

The next year was in a great meaſure ſpent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0466800400:35"/>
and negotiations upon this ſubject, in which the King took a great deal of pains with little effect.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop's declining ſtate of health, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king exerciſe a thing not only convenient but neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for him, he was wont in the ſummer to make a tour into Hampſhire for the ſake of recreation, and being invited by the Lord Zouch to hunt in his park at Bramzil upon the edge of Berkſhire, and not far from Hartford Bridge, his Grace met there with the greateſt misfortune that befel him in the whole courſe of his life; for hunting in this park on the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourth of July, he let fly a barbed arrow from a croſs-bow at one of the deer; which unfortunately ſtruck one Peter Hawkins, my Lord Zouch's keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who was quite out of the Biſhop's ſight, and had been warned more than once to keep out of the way, in the left arm, by which wound a large blood-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel being pierced, he bled to death in an hour's time. This unforeſeen accident threw the Archbiſhop into a deep melancholy, tho' he was not conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the leaſt inadvertency or indiſcretion, neither did this wear off in time, but throughout his whole life he obſerved a monthly faſt on a Tueſday, the day on which this fatal miſchance fell out, and ſettled an annuity of twenty pounds on the widow, which ſoon procured her another huſband.</p>
            <p>This affair made a very great noiſe, and there wanted not ſome to repreſent it in a ſiniſter light to King James, but his majeſty gave his judgment of matter in a ſhort and clear ſentence, <hi>An angel,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>might have miſcarried in this ſort.</hi> When he was afterwards informed of the legal penalties which his grace had incurred by this accident, he wrote him a conſolatory letter with his own hand, in which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0466800400:36"/>
other things he told him, that <hi>he would not add affliction to his ſorrow, or take one farthing from his chattels or moveables which were forfeited by law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop immediately on this misfortune retired to his own hoſpital at Guildford, there to wait the deciſion of the great point as to the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, which ſome imagined he had incurred, for it happened very unluckily that at this juncture, there were four Biſhops elected but not conſecrated, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr John Williams, lord keeper of the great ſeal, to the ſee of Lincoln; Dr John Davenant, to that of Saliſbury; Dr Valentine Cary, to that of Exeter; and his old antagoniſt Dr William Laud, whoſe preferment, on this occaſion, he had warmly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to that of St David's; and all, except Dr Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſcrupled the Archbiſhop's capacity to lay hands on them till he was cleared from all imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to this fact. The King being informed of this, directed, in the beginning of October follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a commiſſion to the ten following perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord Keeper; the Biſhops of London, Winch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſter, and Rocheſter; the Elects of Exeter and St Davids; Sir Henry Hobart, Lord Chief Juſtice of the common pleas; Sir John Dodderidge, one of the juſtices of the King's bench; Sir Henry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, Dean of the Arches; and Dr. Steward; to conſider and reſolve the three following queſtions. 1. <hi>Whether the Archbiſhop was irregular by the fact of involuntary bomicide?</hi> The Biſhop of Wincheſter, the two Judges, and the two Civilians, were very clear that he was not irregular; the other five thought he he was. 2. <hi>Whether that act might tend to ſcandal in a churchman?</hi> The Biſhop of Wincheſter, the Lord Chief Juſtice Hobart, and Dr Steward, doubted; all the reſt agreed, that a ſcandal might be taken tho'
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0466800400:37"/>
not given. 3. <hi>How his Grace ſhould be reſtored, in caſe the King ſhould follow the deciſion of thoſe commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who had found him irregular?</hi> All agreed that it could not be otherwiſe done than by reſtitution from the King, but they varied in the manner. The Biſhop of Wincheſter, the Lord Chief Juſtice, and Dr Steward, thought it ſhould be done by the King, and by him alone, in the ſame patent with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. The Lord Keeper, and the Biſhops of Lond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Rocheſter, Exeter, and St David's, were for a commiſſion from the King directed to ſome Biſhops. Judge Dodderidge, and Sir Henry Martin, were deſirous it ſhould be done both ways, for abundant caution. This return was made to his majeſty on the tenth of November 1621, and accordingly a pardon and a diſpenſation both bearing date at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, the twenty-ſecond of November, paſſed the great ſeal, by which his majeſty aſſoiled the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop from all irregularity, ſcandal, or infamation, (if any was incurred) and declared him capable of all metropolitical authority, as if this accident had never happened. Such was the cloſe of this buſineſs, after a great variety of proceedings, and many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments publiſhed on both ſides<note n="n" place="bottom">

The Archbiſhop being ſenſible of all this, either wrote himſelf, which is moſt probable, or cauſed to be written, a very ſhort piece under this title, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'An apology for Archbiſhop Abbot, touching the death of Peter Hawkins, the Keeper, wounded in the park at Bramzil, July 24, 1621, by an unknown hand.'</q> It was ſent on the eighth of October 1621 to Sir Henry Spelman, who, on t e nineteenth of the ſame month, returned an anſwer to it, which diſcovers full as much ſeverity as learning.

Yet all this could not ſatisfy the minds of thoſe who had ſcrupled the power of laying on hands, and therefore they petitioned the King, that they might not be compelled to wound their conſciences by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to ſuch a conſecration; and, in compliance with their deſire, the Biſhop of Lincoln was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated in King Henry VII's chapel, on the eleventh of November, by the Biſhops of London, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Ely, Oxford, and Llandaff; and the Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops of Sarum, Exeter, and St David's, in the chapel of the Biſhop of London's palace, on the eighteenth of November, by the ſame reverend Prelates.</p>

But another great writer, [Heylin] gives quite another turn to this whole affair, for he owns that the letter came abroad, not in theſe laſt times, as Sanderſon calls them, but at the very time it was ſuppoſed to be written, yet he denies that the Archbiſhop was the author of it, and ſuggeſts, that it was only fathered upon him, that it might make the greater impreſſion upon the people.</p>
               </note>. The King however remained

fixed in his reſolution, and the articles agreed on for

the ſaid marriage, were ſworn to, in the preſence of the Archbiſhop, and other great officers of ſtate, notwithſtanding which they never took effect.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop thenceforward aſſiſted but ſeldom at council, being hindered chiefly by his infirmities, but in the King's laſt ſickneſs he was called for, and attended with great conſtancy, and received the higheſt marks of the King's confidence, to the very laſt moment of his life, and was near him when he expired, on the twenty-ſeventh of March 1625.</p>
            <p>At the coronation of King Charles I, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, as his office required, ſet the crown upon his majeſty's head, tho' he was extremely weak, and much troubled with the gout, but thenceforward he viſibly declined in the King's favour, and the Duke of Buckingham, who was his declared enemy, watched for an opportunity to make the Archbiſhop
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0466800400:42"/>
feel the weight of his diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>This was at laſt taken, for his refuſing to licenſe a ſermon, preached by one Dr Sibthorpe, Vicar of Brackley in Northamptonſhire, to juſtify and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a loan, which the King had demanded. This ſermon was preached at Northampton, in the Lent aſſizes 1627 before the Judges at Northampton, and it was tranſmitted to the Biſhop, with the King's directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to licenſe it, which he refuſed to do, and gave his reaſons for it; notwithſtanding which, the ſermon was licenſed by the Biſhop of London, (Dr Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne) after many things had been corrected therein, from the lights given by the Archbiſhop's objections, for which however it was reſolved that he ſhould ſuffer. Diſcourſes of this nature were ſo loud at court, that ſome of his Grace's friends overheard and reported them to him, upon which he thought fit to retire to his palace at Croydon; a month before his uſual time. On the fifth of July, Lord Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, who was then Secretary of State, made him a viſit, and intimated to him, that the King expected he ſhould withdraw to Canterbury, which the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop declined, becauſe he had a law-ſuit at that time with that city, and deſired he might rather have leave to go to his houſe at Ford, five miles beyond Canterbury, which was yielded to; and on the ninth of October following, the King granted a commiſſion to the Biſhops of London, Durham, Rocheſter, Oxford, and Bath and Wells, to execute archiepiſcopal authority, the cauſe aſſigned being no more than this, <hi>That the Archbiſhop could not at that time, in his own perſon, attend thoſe ſervices, which were otherwiſe proper for his cognizance and juriſdiction.</hi> Some writers have pretended, that his ſuppoſed irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, occaſioned by the Death of Peter Hawkins,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0466800400:43"/>
was revived; but the commiſſion which is extant on record ſhews the contrary, nor indeed was that affair ever thought of afterwards; but the Archbiſhop did not remain long in this ſituation, for the neceſſities of the times rendering a parliament neceſſary, his Grace was ſent for about Chriſtmas, and not only reſtored to his authority aad juriſdiction, but, on his coming to court from his palace at Lambeth, was received when he quitted his barge, by the Archbiſhop of York and the Earl of Dorſet, who conducted him to his majeſty, where, having kiſſed the King's hand, he was deſired not to fail the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil chamber twice a week. His Grace ſat in that parliament which began on the ſeventeenth of March following, and continued in the full exerciſe of his office ever after, of which it may not be amiſs to take notice in this ſingle inſtance. On the twenty-fourth of Auguſt 1628, he conſecrated Richard Montagu, to the ſee of Chicheſter, a man who had been remarkably buſy in ſupporting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> pretence of his irregularity, and at this conſecration Dr Laud, then Biſhop of London, aſſiſted, which is the cleareſt proof that can be, that no doubts ſtuck longer as to his irregularity, even with thoſe who loved him leaſt.</p>
            <p>In parliament, the Archbiſhop maintained his credit in as high a degree as any of his predeceſſors, and it is more than probable, that the knowledge of this procured him ſuch marks of reſpect, as were at this time afforded him by the court. When the Petition of Right, that great pillar of the Engliſh liberty, was under conſideration, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury delivered the ſenſe of the houſe of Lords thereupon, at a conference with the houſe of Commons, and at the ſame time, laid
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0466800400:44"/>
before them ſuch propoſitions as their Lordſhips had agreed upon, for which, thanks were returned, in ſet ſpeech, by Sir Dudley Diggs.</p>
            <p>The intereſt of Biſhop Laud was now ſo great at court, that he drew up a ſcheme of inſtructions, which having the King's name at the head of them, were, in the month of December, 1629, tranſmitted to his Grace, under the pompous title, <hi>His Majeſty's inſtructions to the moſt reverend father in God, George, Lord Archbiſhop of Canterbury, containing certain orders to be obſerved and put in execution, by the ſeveral Biſhops in his province.</hi> Theſe inſtructions his Grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his ſuffragan Biſhops, in which, as Heylin obſerves, he acted <hi>miniſterially;</hi> but to ſhew that he ſtill meant to exerciſe his own authority in his own dioceſe, he reſtored Mr Palmer and Mr Udnay to their lectureſhips, after the Dean and Archdeacon of Canterbury had ſuſpended them; and, in other reſpects, ſoftened the rigour of thoſe inſtructions, which were contrived to enforce the particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a prevailing party in the Church, which the Archbiſhop thought a burden too hard to be borne by the tender conſciences of thoſe who made the fundamentals of religion their ſtudy, and were not ſo zealous for forms.</p>
            <p>His conduct in this and other reſpects, is ſaid to have made his preſence unwelcome at court, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o indeed it ſeems to have been, for upon the birth of Charles, Prince of Wales, (afterwards King Charles II,) which happened on the 29th of May, 1630, Laud, then Biſhop of London, had the honour to baptize him as D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an of the chapel, notwithſtanding that the Archbiſhop of Canterbury is the Ordinary of the court, and the King's houſhold, wherever it is, are regarded as his pariſhioners; ſo this was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0466800400:45"/>
viſibly as much a ſlight upon the Archbiſhop, as an act of favour towards his antagoniſt.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop however was proof againſt all ſuch accidents as theſe, and went on doing his duty without fear or favour, and yet one of the laſt acts of his life plainly ſhews, that he was very far from being ſo indifferent towards the diſcipline and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of England, as ſome have repreſented him. This act of his was an order dated the third of July 1633, requiring the pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioners of Crayford in Kent, to receive the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper, on their knees, at the ſteps aſcending to the communion table.</p>
            <p>We may well ſtile this one of his laſt acts, ſince a month a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>terwards, <hi>viz.</hi> on the fourth of Auguſt in the ſame year, he deceaſed at his palace of Croydon, worn out with cares and infirmities, at the age of ſeventy-one.</p>
            <p>He was buried according to his own expreſs direction, in the chapel of our Lady, within the church dedicated to the holy Trinity, in his native town of Guildford in Surrey. Soon after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, a noble monument was erected over his grave with the effigies of the Archbiſhop in his Epiſcopal robes, and over that his Parliament Robes, in white marble, lying under the Arch ſupported by ſix black marble pillars of the Dorick Order, raiſed on pedeſtals of books piled up. In niches, at the Eaſt end of the Monument, are two figures, over their heads, thus, <hi>Hinc Lumen</hi> [<hi>Hence Light</hi>], <hi>Hic Gratia</hi> [<hi>Here Grace</hi>]. On the top prettily diſpoſed are nine ſmall figures, one of which has the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <hi>Fidit &amp; Patitur</hi> [<hi>he Truſts and Suffers.</hi>] On the Weſt end, below the cuſhion, is a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>THAT worthy Prelate did ſurely deſerve a better repreſentation to poſterity. He was a very wiſe and prudent man, knew well the temper and diſpoſition of the kingdom with reſpect to the ceremonies and power of the church, and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe a moderation in the point of eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, which if it had been followed by his ſucceſſor, the ruin that ſoon after fell on the church might very likely have been prevented. His being without any credit at court from the latter end of King James's reign will bring no diſhonour on his memory, if it be conſider'd that his diſgrace aroſe from his diſlike of, and oppoſition to the imprudent and corrupt meaſures of the court at that time, and from an honeſt zeal for the laws and liberties of his country which ſeem'd then to be in no ſmall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and it was a part truly becoming the high ſtation he then bore. His advice upon the affair
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0466800400:61"/>
of the Palatinate and the Spaniſh match ſhewed his knowledge of the true intereſt of England, and how much it was at his heart; and his behaviour and ſufferings in the next reign about the loan and Sibthorp's ſermon as they were the reaſons of his diſgrace at that time, ſo ought they to render his memory valuable to all who wiſh not to ſee the fatal counſels and the oppreſſion of thoſe times revived in this nation. The Duke of Buckingham was his enemy becauſe the Archbiſhop would not be his creature, and the church perhaps might have been thought to have been better govern'd, if he had ſtooped to the Duke and given in to the wantonneſſes of his power: but he knew the dignity of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and loved his country too well to ſubmit to ſuch a meanneſs, tho' very few of his brethren had the courage or honeſty to join with him in this, and if the Archbiſhop himſelf is to be credited<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide his Narrative.</note>, his ſucceſſor's riſe was by the practice of thoſe arts this good man could not bend to. As to his learning we need no better teſtimony of it than his promotion by King James, who had too much affectation that way to prefer any one to ſuch a ſtation who had not borne the reputation of a ſcholar; but there are other proofs of his ſufficiency in this, even for the high place he held in the church. If he had ſome narrow notions in divinity, they were rather the faults of the age he had his education in, than his, and the ſame imputation may be laid on the beſt and moſt learned of the reformers. His warmth againſt popery became the office of a Proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0466800400:62"/>
tho' even towards Papiſts there is a<note n="*" place="bottom">See Ruſhworth's Collections, vol. 1ſt. page 243.</note> remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtance of his mildneſs and charity, which ſhewed that his zeal againſt their perſons went no farther than the ſafety of the ſtate required. His parts ſeem to have been ſtrong and maſterly, his preaching grave and eloquent, and his ſtile equal to any of that time. He was eminent for piety and a care for the poor, and his hoſpitality fully anſwer'd the injunction King James laid on him, which was to carry his houſe nobly, and to live like an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop. He had no thoughts of heaping up riches; what he did ſave was laid out by him in the erecting and endowing of an handſome Hoſpital for decay'd tradeſmen, and the widows of ſuch, in the town of Guildford in the county of Surrey, where he was born and had his firſt education; and here I cannot omit taking notice that the body of Statutes drawn by himſelf for the government of that houſe, is one of the moſt judicious works of that kind I ever ſaw, and under which for near one hundred years that Hoſpital has main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the beſt credit of any that I know in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. He was void of all pomp and oſtentation, and thought the nearer the church and church-men came to the ſimplicity of the firſt chriſtians, the better would the true ends of religion be ſerved, and that the purity of the heart was to be preferred to, and ought rather to be the care of a ſpiritual go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, than the devotion of the hands only. If under this notion ſome niceties in diſcipline were given up to goodneſs of life, and when the peace of the church as well as of the kingdom was preſerved
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0466800400:63"/>
by it, 'twas ſurely no ill piece of prudence, nor is his memory therefore deſerving of thoſe ſlanders it has undergone upon that account. It is eaſy to ſee that much of this treatment has been owing to a belief in the admirers and followers of Archbiſhop Laud, that the reputation of the latter was encreaſed by depreciating that of the former. They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed men of very different frames and the parts they took in the affairs both of church and ſtate as difa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing. In the church, moderation and the ways of peace guided the behaviour of the firſt, rigour and ſeverity that of the laſt. In the ſtate they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally carried the like principles and temper. The one made the liberty of the people and the laws of the land the meaſure of his actions, when the other, to ſpeak ſoftly of it, had the power of the Prince and the exalting the prerogative only, for the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his. They were indeed both of 'em men of courage and reſolution; but it was ſedate and temperate in Abbot, paſſionate and unruly in Laud. It is not however to be denied that many rare and excellent virtues were poſſeſſed by the latter; but it muſt be owned too, he ſeems rather made for the hierarchy of another church and to be the miniſter of an arbitrary Prince, and the other to have had the qualifications of a Proteſtant Biſhop and the guardian of a free ſtate. Thus much I thought was due to the character of this good man, not only for the ſake of juſtice, but as an offering of gratitude to his memory for the great and laſting obligations the town of Guildford (to which I have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) lies under to him. And what I have here ſaid of him I am amply juſtified in, from ſeveral

               <p>IN the Name of Almighty God from whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone cometh my help, I George Abbot by the Providence of God Archbiſhop of Canterbury, conſidering with myſelf the certaintie of that decree that it is appointed for all men to die once, and weighing the uncertainty of that hour when my Lord and Great Maſter will call for me, being now in reaſonable health and perfect memory, I praiſe God for the ſame, and being willing to diſpoſe of myſelf, and of that ſmall portion of wealth which the Lord in mercy hath lent unto me, do make this my laſt Will and Teſtament as followeth.</p>
               <p>FIRST, I do thank the God of Heaven and Earth, for bringing me from meaner eſtate to a place of ſome note in his church, which by his mercy and unſpeakable goodneſs I have laboured to diſcharge to my power in ſimplicity of conſcience, having ever in my memory that great and laſt day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, when all mens bodies ſhall ſtand before that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0466800400:67"/>
tribunal of Chriſt, and in the mean while not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that ſaying of the Prophet<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm cxvi. v. 11.</note>, <hi>Quid retribuam Domino?</hi> becauſe in ſo many troubles as this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant world doth afford his Divine Majeſty did ever protect and uphold me, and ſo I truſt that high and great God will out of his incomprehenſible love do unto the end. Then I commend my ſoul unto the bleſſed Trinity, the Father who created it, the Son who redeemed it, the Holy Ghoſt who in ſome meaſure hath ſanctified it, beſeeching that God in Trinity and the ſame Trinity in Unity to receive it into the kingdom of heaven there to reign for ever for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, by whoſe death and bitter paſſion only which that unſpotted and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent lamb did ſuffer for the ſins of the world, I ſtedfaſtly hope to have full and free remiſſion of all my offences, according to the truth of the goſpel now by his great mercy publiſhed in this famous Church of England, which I hold to be the beſt framed pattern of all the Churches in Europe, and according to the doctrine which in my life-time for full forty years together (when I write this) I have taught in my preaching and maintained in my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and in the verity whereof (becauſe it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the ſacred ſcriptures of the old and new Teſtament) I hope to appear with chearfulneſs and confidence before the throne of God.</p>
               <p>I commend my body to the earth in aſſured hope of a joyful reſurrection, deſiring to be buried in the Trinity Church at Guildford which is near unto my Hoſpital, that in the ſame town where my fleſh had the beginning thereof, it may reſt as the <hi>depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum</hi> of my love to that place; but I leave all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0466800400:68"/>
circumſtances of my interring and funeral to the judgment and diſcretion of mine Executors.</p>
               <p>I give to the Poor of the pariſh of Lambeth thirty pounds; and to the Poor of the pariſh of Croydon twenty pounds; both theſe ſums to be diſpoſed according to the diſcretion of mine Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and if it may be it is beſt that they ſhould be directed to ſome permanent uſe.</p>
               <p>I have heretofore given to the Mayor and his Brethren at Guildford one hundred pounds<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Letter to the Corporation of <hi>Guildford.</hi>
                  </note>, which ſum is in their hands, or at leaſt in their diſpoſing, I declared it ſo at firſt and my deſire is that it ſhould be preſerved to a perpetual uſe, to be lent by five and twenty pounds a man to four ſeveral tradeſmen in that town, to ſet poor men on work; I would not have theſe ſums to be lent but upon good ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and to hold for two or three years at the moſt, without any intereſt or conſideration (ſaving paying for making the bonds) and then to be lent from time to time to other traders there, with this proviſo upon the bonds that if any of the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to die before the end of the term for which the money is lent, that the ſum be repayed or delivered back to the Mayor and his Brethren within three months after his deceaſe.</p>
               <p>To him whoſoever ſhall ſucceed me in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick I give all the pictures and maps now hanging in the gallery at Lambeth, together with my barge, praying him not to grieve my Executors for dilapidations, ſince it appeareth to the world how careful I have been in repairing all the houſes belonging to the See of Canterbury, beyond that which my predeceſſors have done in the memory of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0466800400:69"/>
man, and that I have beſtowed divers thouſands of pounds upon the ſame, as may well be ſeen by books of accounts truly kept concerning thoſe expences, beſides the care which to my great charge I have had for the preſervation of the woods of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick ſtanding in Kent and Surrey, which I have ſo ſpared beyond my predeceſſors, that I have bought timber to the value of ſome hundreds of pounds to repair my houſes, becauſe I would not cut young trees, but let them grow up to the benefit of my ſuccceſſors; and being now fair I leave it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his Majeſty's conſideration, whether it be not fit that my ſucceſſor and ſucceſſors to enter good bond into the exchequer not to cut any timber, ſaving for neceſſary reparations of his own houſes, which was the courſe holden in Queen Elizabeth's days eſpecially for the Biſhoprick of Wincheſter, and not unfit elſewhere to be followed. I have many books in the great ſtudy or library at Lambeth marked with theſe two letters G C, I bequeath thoſe to that library to the uſe of the Archbiſhops of Canterbury in ſucceſſion; and I appoint that a catalogue ſhould be made of them, and ſent to the Dean and Chapter of the cathedral church in Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erbury to be there kept, and a tranſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0466800400:70"/>
were left by my Lord Bancroft may be diverted from the uſe of my ſucceſſors, and ſo this great and good work be fruſtrated, as far as in me lieth I do in the name of that dreadful and Almighty God, who is the rewarder of all men's deſervings be they good or be they evil, lay it upon the ſoul and conſcience of him and them that ſhall ſucceed me in this Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick, that to the beſt of their power by all means they keep that library and all the books ſafe as I have done, and I pray God to bleſs all them that have that good mind, and to divert and hinder all thoſe that have any intendment to the contrary, and this I pray not only for and concerning my ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors but all other perſons whatſoever,</p>
               <p>My next general care is of my ſervants among whom I do not know any unhoneſt or unworthy man, my will for them is that my houſhold ſhould by my Executors be kept together at my charge for the ſpace of one month after my deceaſe, that men may have ſome time to diſpoſe of themſelves. And to begin with the pooreſt; I do give two hundred pounds to be divided by my Executors unto forty yeomen or inferior of my ſervants by five pounds a year. And I give forty pounds more to ſupply any forgetfulneſs of mine towards ſuch as have ſerved me; or if the ſum beforenamed do not hold out, thoſe laſt moneys to be diſpoſed by the diſcretion of mine Executors towards gentlemen or yeomen where they ſhall ſee fit, and according to what proportion they ſhall hold moſt convenient; thoſe to whom I give particular legacies are to have none of this two hundred and the forty pounds, but my ſervan s at Croydon are to be taken in. To ſuch gentlemen
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0466800400:71"/>
as at the time of my death ſhall ſerve me in houſe, and have no portions or named legacies, I give to each of them a gold ring to the value of forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to wear in remembrance of me. And I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat my ſucceſſor whoſoever he ſhall be to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo many of my ſervants as he ſhall need, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him that he can not have more honeſt and ſerviceable perſons to attend him.</p>
               <p>To Sir Edmond Scott I give my little ſilver clock, and a trencher ſalt of gold without a cover, which remaineth among my plate, and this he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as a memorial of my love, becauſe otherwiſe by my means he is not ill provided for, although if if it were more he is worthy of it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Richard Brigham, the controller of my houſe, I give my four coach mares, and one hundred pounds in money, he knoweth that I have not been altogether forgetful of him in my life-time, but all that I have done is too little, becauſe his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diligence, and diſcretion hath been ſuch in ſerving me that my eſtate by his means hath been the better within doors and without.</p>
               <p>To my two chaplains attending me in mine houſe I give my pictures and maps in the gallery at Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to be divided between them; and to each of them a ring of gold of forty ſhillings. And ſuch another ring I give to my chaplain Maſter Edward Abbott of Loarkin.</p>
               <p>To my ſecretary Maſter William Baker, as honeſt a man as ever ſerved any maſter, I give my gold ring with the table diamond to wear in remembrance of me, praying him to take ſome pains to perfect up the catalogue of my books given to the library at Lambeth, that it may orderly appear to poſterity what I have left there, according to the care that I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0466800400:72"/>
did take for the books left by my predeceſſour the Lord Bancroft the founder and firſt beginner of that library; I give him alſo the great inlayed cabinet of wood ſtanding in the Queen's chamber at Lambeth, the keys whereof lie in the old deſk which ſtandeth in the ſtudy, which is next to the cloſet near the chapel.</p>
               <p>To Maſter Richard Line I bequeath my leſſer gold chain, and twenty pounds of money if he owe me ſo much at the time of my death; I have done ſomething for him in my life-time according to my ability, and it may fall out that I may do more.</p>
               <p>To Maſter William Sherman I give a gold ring with a turtoyſe in it which I have ready lying by me, and a piece of gilt plate of thirty ounces, I have not altogether forgotten him heretofore in ſome other matters.</p>
               <p>To honeſt John Goodwyn I give one hundred marks in money, and my big clock which uſeth commonly to ſtand in my chamber; I have much deſired to leave him ſome office or matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, but God hitherto hath not offered me the means to do it according to my deſire.</p>
               <p>To Ralph Watts who long hath ſerved me pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and diligently I give alſo one hundred marks in money, and a gold ring with a turkoiſe in it; I have done ſomething for him beſides, but I wiſh it were much more.</p>
               <p>To Walter Dobſon my receiver, and the receiver of the archbiſhoprick, I give twenty pounds, and the ring with the Weſt-Indian ſapphire which I have uſed to wear having my arms cut in it; I hope he hath not utterly loſt his time under me, and therefore he will be content with this remembrance of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0466800400:73"/>
him. I leave him alſo my little written book with the blue ſtrings, wherein are ſet down the leaſes and woods, and proviſions belonging to the archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, I would have him keep it to himſelf for it may be of good uſe unto him.</p>
               <p>To George Aiſme, my page and godſon, I give ten pounds, and one of the ſummer nags which I have running amongſt my horſes.</p>
               <p>To Maſter John Harte, ſometime ſolicitor of my cauſes, I give all the arrearages of young Liveſays wardſhip, if any be behind; and I give him alſo a gold ring with a turtoiſe in it.</p>
               <p>I bequeath to Robert Clarke, yeoman of my horſe, ten pounds. And ſo much I give alſo to George Holliſt.</p>
               <p>I give moreover to Maſter Francis Harton, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter John Goodwin, and Ralph Watts, the remainder of young Peyton's wardſhip to be equally divided amongſt them as it hath been heretofore. To Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dobſon I give that which is left of Turvey's wardſhip <hi>(videlicet)</hi> fifty ſhillings yearly. And to George Hollis the remainder of Pole Wheeler's wardſhip ſo long as it doth continue, I do not know the time but it is fifty ſhillings by the year.</p>
               <p>To Sir Dudley Diggs, my antient pupil in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, I give my ring ſet with an orient ſapphire, and all my antique coins of gold, ſilver, and braſs which are in my ſtudy at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>To Sir Henry Martin, dean of the arches, and my good friend, I bequeath all my ſerpentine cups and veſſels, which I give him that when he ſeeth ruſeth t h em he may think of me.</p>
               <p>To Maſter Serjeant Hendon, my old Oxford acquaintance and friend, careful in my law-buſineſs, I give the fair bible which lieth in a white box,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0466800400:74"/>
ſtanding in that room wherein I have heretofore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſtudied while I remained at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>To the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury I do give five and twenty of thoſe books which now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in my ſtudy at Croydon, and I do give five and twenty more (to be taken after the other from thence) to the Dean and Chapter of Wincheſter to be put into their ſeveral libraries, and theſe I wiſh my Executors to chooſe out with the privity and ſome advice of the Dean or Vice-Dean of thoſe churches for the time being, ſuppoſing that they wiſh to have ſuch books as be not in their libraries already.</p>
               <p>For Baliol college I have done divers things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and if God ſend me life I have a purpoſe to let them taſte ſomething more of my courteſy.</p>
               <p>There is a leaſe of two houſes which was taken in the name of my brother Sir Morris Abbot, as he very well knoweth, my will is that my executors do ſo order it that twenty pounds yearly out of the benefit ariſing by that leaſe, be paid to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther John Abbot of Guildford during his life, if the leaſe do ſo long continue; and other twenty pounds yearly ariſing from that leaſe I appoint to be paid to the wife of Peter Hawkins ſometime of Bramſil in Hampſhire, for ſo long as the ſaid wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth live and no longer. What benefit may be made by the renewing the under leaſes, together with the remainder of the time after the deceaſe of my brother John and the wife of Peter Hawkins, I give to my nephew Mr. Maurice Abbot of the Inner-Temple, and I pray my executors that theſe things may be truly performed according to my honeſt meaning.</p>

               <p>I had a purpoſe to have left ſome yearly revenue for the maintenance of a conduit which I built in the town of Canterbury, but the mayor of that city and his brethren by the inſtigation of two or three perſons have uſed me ſo unreſpectfully and ungratefully, that I have held it fit to alter that purpoſe.</p>

               <p>Touching the hoſpital erected by me in Guildford where I was born, and my parents of good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory long inhabited; I have finiſhed the main building, and if there be any thing of decency or ornament convenient to be added thereunto, if God permit me life I ſhall accompliſh thoſe alſo. I have procured from my old ſovereign King James of bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed memory a gracious mortmain, and I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſtatutes for the good government thereof, which I have cauſed formerly to be ſet down, and I have ſent them to the hoſpital; I may peradventure add ſome ſmall things unto thoſe ſtatutes during my life but if after my deceaſe any thing appear not to be perfect, I leave the charge of the explaining the ſame unto my executors, to whom I leave a power to change circumſtances if neceſſity ſo require, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they keep the ſubſtance of mine intendment. My purpoſe in the firſt place is to maintain there one maſter of the hoſpital, twelve poor brothers, and eight poor ſiſters all aged perſons of honeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. But my intent in the ſecond place is that ſome manufacture be ſet up in that town of Guildford, to find work for the younger ſort of people. And to that end I have begun the work already, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owed a good ſtock upon it. For the proſecution of this manufacture I crave the furtherance of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0466800400:78"/>
mayor and his brethren in that town, wiſhing that they will jointly agree together for the beſt courſe to promote that buſineſs, the honour will be God's, the reputation will be theirs, and will be a great benefit to that town if their poor be ſet on work. I would have my executors and the maſter of the hoſpital ever willing and ready to help forward mine inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if they all look at the public and not too much at the private, God will give a great bleſſing unto it. I have appointed a room for the work-houſe, and I hope it be already fitted thereto. For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of the poor of the hoſpital I have bought land at Merrow, of one Maſter Harwood, and I have already paſſed it to that houſe; if there be no ſuch conveyance made, I do by this my will give that land to the maſter and brethren of that hoſpital. I have bought alſo of one Maſter Goodwin lands at Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redin, or lands called Meredin, to the rent of forty pounds by the year. And of one Conſtable I have bought land at Horſham, yielding rent to the value of forty pounds by the year. Theſe two parcels I do give to my hoſpital for ever, and I would have my executors to help forward thoſe donations of mine if there be cauſe, but no way to hinder them. I have bought of Thomas Hill land at Ewhurſt for the yearly rent of twenty-ſeven pounds, ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; if it ſhall ſeem fit to Mr. George Duncan to have this land changed, I ſhall not be againſt it, ſo that there be as much land for value, and a good title laid in lieu of it; but be it one or the other I give it to my hoſpital. For the upholding of the manufacture ſet up by me in Guildford I do give one hundred pounds a year for ever to the ſaid my hoſpital, (that is to ſay) threeſcore pounds a year bought of Maſter Biſhe, and forty pounds by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0466800400:79"/>
the year lying at Charlewood and bought of one Polſdon; and howſoever perhaps I do not hitt on the right names of the ſellers, or the places where theſe lands lie, I will that it be no hinderance to this my donation or donations, but that the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be made good to the maſter and brethren of my hoſpital. I intended for the maintenance of the poor of my hoſpital two hundred pounds by the year, and now by the releaſing of certain wood ground bought of one Bromfield of Katherine-Hill near Guildford, there wanteth the rent of twelve pounds ten ſhillings yearly charged upon my hoſpital. If I provide not this in my life-time, I require my exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors to ſupply it with ſpeed; but I am upon a bargain in Suſſex, which I hope ſhall clear it up all. And whereas my good friend Sir Nicholas Kempe did by his laſt will and teſtament, give five hundred pounds to be beſtowed on ſome good work as I ſhould think meet, I here declare that I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed that whole ſum upon ſome of the lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned to be bought and conveyed to my hoſpital, which I do being warranted thereunto not only by the general words of his will, but by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſignification from himſelf, for he was preſent when I laid the firſt ſtone of the chapel for that hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital and gave me one hundred pounds towards the work, and ſince from to time, and lately before his death being with me at Croydon, he voluntarily aſſured me he would be mindful of that houſe and foundation; and whereas he doth not in his will ſpecially name the hoſpital, I conceive the reaſon of it out of true ground to be, becauſe he did not know whether I would have any man's name uſed in the founding of that houſe and corporation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides mine own; but I declare him now a principal
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0466800400:80"/>
and the only benefactor of moment to that place, and I have cauſed mention to be made of it in the ſtatutes of that houſe that he did confer to that foundation ſix hundred pounds, which to poſterity will be an honour and memorial to that good knight ſometime an officer in the archbiſhoprick and to me.</p>
               <p>For the performance of this my laſt will and teſtament I muſt appoint ſome perſon or perſons to take care, I having a good part been mine own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, having already diſtributed with mine own hands much of that little which God hath given unto me. But yet for the further accompliſhing of that which I intend, and for the diſpoſing of my funeral, I appoint my executors my brother Sir Morris Abbot Knight, and my nephew Mr. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice Abbot of the Inner-Temple, Barriſter, not doubting but care will be taken that all things ſhall be performed according to my true meaning above expreſſed. Whatſoever is remaining (my funeral charges excepted) be it money, bonds, plate, debts, cattle, or other moveables will fall to mine executors, who I doubt not but will take pains for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of my will, and among other things will look that my note books which are written with mine own hand, be ſafely kept. Such legacies as I have given to my ſervants I wiſh to be ſatisfied with all convenient ſpeed, eſpecially to thoſe who are the poorer of them; and the like I declare for that which is by me bequeathed to the pariſhes of Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and Croydon. There is no great matter to be done to my hoſpital, but if any ſmall thing be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite I would have it done as ſoon as may be.</p>
               <p>So beſeeching Almighty God to increaſe the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0466800400:81"/>
number of his faithful, to abate more and more daily the ſtrength of antichriſt and popery; to ſend peace and proſperity to this iſland; to bleſs our ſovereign my moſt gracious lord and maſter the king with long life and happineſs, and to ſend him a fair and plentiful iſſue; I commend my ſoul again and again to the mercy of my moſt bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer.</p>

               <opener>Memorand. That the letter underwritten being ſent to this Town, before this day, by the Lord Archbiſhop of Canterbury, his grace, for ſpecial reaſons is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be regiſtered on Record, and followeth in theſe words, viz.</opener>
               <p>AFTER my hearty commendations, I do not live ſo far from you, but that I many times do enquire of the ſtate of your town, which, becauſe it was the place of my beginning, I cannot chuſe but have in extraordinary recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. And underſtanding that it hath not pleaſed God to give unto it that flouriſhing eſtate for trade and traffique which I have known it ſometime to have, I have often, both in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with myſelf, and in conſideration with ſome of my friends, your well willers, debated by what means I might give the beſt furtherance unto the ſame, wherein if I ſhall acquaint you with my thoughts, you will bear with me, becauſe they all proceed from a good mind toward you, and if I erre in any thing, upon information I ſhall quickly be reformed. Firſt therefore you muſt know, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0466800400:83"/>
conſidering my perpetual expence, my means are not great, to bring about ſome ſuch thing as my heart hath deſired, as perhaps for the erecting of ſome hoſpital, as my moſt worthy predeceſſor the Lord Archbiſhop Whitgift did at Croydon, the like whereof would require a full purſe, and long continuance of time in the place which I hold, whereof no man can take to himſelf any aſſurance, ſince we are daily in the hand of God, and enjoy our breath, but at his pleaſure. But in this I do not forget, that this may be a relief for ſome few aged folks, but the generality of the town is not the better for it, whereas if the corporation did thrive and flouriſh, thoſe poor and aged people, would eaſily be maintained by the charity of ſuch as be of beſt ability.</p>
               <p>Some other time, my mind hath run upon beſtowing of ſome ſtock upon the town, that men who do trade, might have ſome money lent them for two or three years, freely, putting in ſome good ſecurity to the Mayor and his brethren to repay the ſame again, that ſo the ſtock may go from hand to hand, and be preſerved to poſterity. But here I have thought that if trade be not good, this can little avail, for a well meaning man may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and not only loſe that which is lent unto him, but that alſo which he hath of his own, and then to force ſureties to pay his debt, is to weaken the eſtate of other who did undertake for him. Upon theſe and the like deliberations, I have thought then with myſelf what courſe there may be taken for the advancing of trade amongſt you, which will ſet the poor on work, and may be a benefit unto the common-wealth, and the thing which I moſt pitch upon is clothing, becauſe both
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0466800400:84"/>
town and country hath been accuſtomed thereunto. And yet herein I confeſs that the making of your kerſies doth give me little ſatisfaction, becauſe ſometimes they are up for the price, and ſometimes they are down; and as far as I can learn by the Merchants which deal for cloth, there is not great hope in that kind of any certainty hereafter.</p>
               <p>So that this putting me to ſeek further, I have entred into conſideration, whether it were not good to fall to the making of ſtuffes, as they call them; as Say, Serge, Dorincks, Durance, Perpetuana, and other of that kind, which might employ the wool growing thereabout, and exerciſe the people in Labour. And here I find as many difficulties, for it is a great attempt to alter the trade of a Town ſo far from the former courſe thereof; and perhaps a glutt of them may cauſe them to be as ill vented as other cloths are now.</p>
               <p>Thus out of my love to the place of my birth, and to you all, I ſtand diſtracted what to do, if God ſhould make me able to effect any thing for you; but after all thoſe ways above-named, my meditations have fallen upon this, whether in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability the making of broad cloth, either blues or mingled, or white, be not a likelier trade to thrive than that which is now uſed; and if there may be appearance thereof, (for certainty I know there is none in any mortal thing) the greateſt will be to alter the tools which now are, as Racks, Mills, &amp;c. into thoſe which are convenient for the making of broad Cloth; now in this methinks I may give you ſome help, If I ſhall do as the low Countrymen lately have promiſed to do to their people, the more to invite them to the making of cloth, That is, to beſtow four or five pound upon
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0466800400:85"/>
every man that will ſet up a loom at firſt; and in like proportion to the alteration of Mills, and other inſtruments fit for that whereof I ſpeak, which, if God do bleſs me, I ſhall be willing to do to ſome reaſonable quantity, if it may do good unto that corporation, the welfare whereof I ſo much deſire.</p>
               <p>My requeſt unto you Mr. Mayor, and to your brethren, is, that you will think upon theſe things, and meeting together at your own oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, deliberate what may be moſt available for the place wherein you live, which I would have you to beat, and beat again with yourſelves, and others, before you return me an anſwer, leſt if any alteration ſhould haſtily be, and it ſhould have ill ſucceſs, blame ſhould be laid upon me when I have not deſerved it. And if you can find out any other matter, than thoſe which I have thought upon, if they be not of too great Charge, I ſhall upon Conſultation, eaſily condeſcend unto your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, for I have a meaning to do you ſome good, as God ſhall ſend me life, and afford me ability.</p>
               <p>In token whereof, I have now diſpatched away one hundred pounds, which I truſt my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Mr. Robert Parkhurſt, will ſee by exchange conveyed unto you. And this money I would have to be no way employed, but to be laid up in ſafe cuſtody, until ſuch time as I ſhall give order for the uſing of the ſame, upon ſuch reſolution as I ſhall receive jointly from you. And ſo thanking you for ſundry remembrances, which at ſeveral times I have received from you, I forbear at this time to be further troubleſome to you, but leave you to the good bleſſing of the Almighty.</p>

In the ſouth eaſt corner of the quadrangle are genteel apartments for the maſter; on the weſt ſide are apartments for the brethren, and on the eaſt for the ſiſters. The chapel at the north eaſt corner, is ſpacious and high roofed, and has two large gothic windows of painted glaſs very well ſtained, repreſenting as follows. The north window has four lights, divided with ſtone work: in the firſt, Iſaac is ſending Eſau for veniſon, Rebecca behind; and from a window, at a diſtance, Eſau is diſcovered hunting. See <hi>Geneſis</hi> 27th ch. Underneath is this inſcription.<q>

to the town of Guildford, wherein I was born, and where my aged parents lived many years in good repute, I have thought upon erecting an Hoſpital there, which I have dedicated to the Bleſſed Trinity. And intending that poor people ſhould be maintained therein, think good to lay down certain Statutes and Ordinances, which ſhall be for the governing of the Maſter, Brothers, and Siſters there, as alſo of all other perſons who are therein to be placed; and of the guidement of the poſſeſſions and rents, which God hath and may enable me to beſtow upon the ſame.

                  <p>I Do reſerve unto myſelf, the nomination of the Maſter, ſo long as it pleaſes God that I ſhall live; and after my deceaſe I appoint, that if the place ſhall be void by the death, reſignation, or expulſion of the former Maſter, that then the Vice-Maſter, or in his abſence the Senior Brother, ſhall, as ſoon as may be, give notice to the electors that the place is void, that ſo they may meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the chapel of the hoſpital to make a new choice. The electors I appoint to be five; the Mayor of Guildford (or in his abſence his deputy); the Parſon of Trinity pariſh (and if he be not in town, the Parſon of St. Nicholas pariſh); and three of the brethren of the hoſpital, that is to ſay, the Vice-Maſter, and the two Senior, or moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Brethren; and look on whom the greater part of theſe five ſhall agree, he ſhall be admitted to the place of maſter; theſe ſhall proceed without favour or affection, or without any corruption whatſoever, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or indirectly, as in the preſence of God, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſly touching the good or evil actions of all men in the day of Chriſt. This election I appoint to be within four and twenty hours of the being void of the maſterſhip, or at leaſt within that ſpace after it ſhall known that the place is void. And if within that time it be not ſupplied by a new election, I then order, that by way of devolution it ſhall fall to the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, to be nominated by him according to my ſtatutes; and if the See of Canterbury be void, or the Archbiſhop <hi>ſede plena</hi> ſhall not deſign the Maſter within twelve days, then it ſhall be in the

When the election, or nomination is thus paſſed, the perſon elected, or nominated, ſhall in the preſence of all the brethren of the houſe, in the Chapel of the Hoſpital, take firſt the oath of ſovereignty and obedience to the King's Majeſty, his lawful heirs and ſucceſſors, as by law preſcribed, and then this oath here enſuing.</p>

And at the end of the year, he ſhall have a ſtipend of thirteen ſhillings and four-pence out of the common cheſt; he ſhall keep one of the keys of the evidence houſe, and another key of the common cheſt; and in the abſence of the maſter, he ſhall night by night, have the keys of the hoſpital brought unto him.</p>

I do ordain that this nomination be perfected and accompliſhed within four and twenty hours, after the known death or avoidance of any formerly poſſeſſed with the place; and if the mayor, or deputy, for their turns, do not deſign the perſon to be ſupplied within the ſpace above-named, then my will is, that the parſon of the pariſh of St. Nicholas do appoint him, or her, that is to ſucceed; and if the maſter of the hoſpital, or the ſchoolmaſter do not deſign for their turns, the perſon to be ſupplied by them within the ſpace aforeſaid, then my will is, that the parſon of Trinity pariſh do appoint him or her that is to ſucceed; and if the ſaid perſon be not at that time at home, then the maſter of the hoſpital; which, if he be not then at the nomination ſhall fall to the parſon of St. Mary's church, in Guildford; all which nominations I would have to be as in the preſence of God, without corruption, or filthy lucre; without favour, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter affection; for I give unto theſe perſons this power only upon truſt, and not to make a gain of that which I have ſpared from my back and from my belly, and from my kindred, and from ſome other good uſe in ſome other place, to beſtow for God's ſake on the poor members of Chriſt in this town; the Lord forbid that any man ſhould abuſe this my charity, for which he did never ſweat or labour.</p>
                  <p>The manner of theſe nominations I ordain to be, that the mayor, maſter of the hoſpital, or other perſon, in whom the power of appointing or deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for that turn is, do come into the Chapel of the ſaid Hoſpital, and there before four, or more of the brethren, do name him or her, whom in his conſcience he findeth fitteſt; which being done, the maſter, or vice-maſter ſhall conduct the perſon ſo named to the chamber which is void; which he or ſhe ſhall preſently enjoy, but not have any other allowance of the houſe, till the end of one quarter of a year; the money that is to be ſaved being to be put into the common cheſt of the hoſpital, to ſupply reparations, law-ſuits, and other caſualties; but after the end of three months, the brother or ſiſter deſign'd, ſhall in the chapel of the hoſpital, before the maſter, or vice-maſter, firſt take the oath of allegiance, or obedience to the King's Majeſty, as by law it is preſcribed, and then this oath enſuing.</p>

                  <p>Here I think fit to add this. That becauſe it may fall out that there be not men or women of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years of age, and ſingle perſons in the town to ſupply ſuch places as are void, (as in my own life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time I found once by experience that there were not)

                  <p>AMONG or above all things that ſuch perſons as remain in the hoſpital are to do, it is firſt to take care that God be ſerved, who is the giver and continuer of all good things. The maſter therefore of the hoſpital ſhall ſo often as he conveniently can, read ſome part of divine ſervice, according to the book of common prayer, morning and evening, in the chapel of the hoſpital, to the brethren and ſiſters, and give God thanks, for their founder, and all other God's benefits and bleſſings; and this to be every day, except thoſe hereafter mentioned; and if the maſter does not perform it himſelf, then the vice-maſter, (whom I would have always choſen ſuch a one as can handſomely read) or in his abſence, ſuch a one of the brothers as the maſter ſhall appoint, ſhall without grudging perform that office, there can no man be too good to ſerve God. On the ſabbath-days, feſtival-days, Wedneſdays, and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, at morning and evening prayers, and at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0466800400:120"/>
at evening prayers, all the brethren and ſiſters of the hoſpital being at home and not ſick, (except the porter, who is to tarry at home to keep the houſe in the abſence of the reſt) ſhall repair two and two in orderly faſhion to Trinity church (which is near unto them) and there devoutly pray with the reſt of the congregation, for the preſervation of the king's majeſty, his children and iſſue when God ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, as alſo for the happineſs and proſperity of his kingdoms, and hear the word of God preached and read, and there be partakers of the Lord's ſupper at leaſt thrice every year; and to the end all perſons that are able may be preſent at prayers in the chapel or pariſh church, the maſter, or vice-maſter in his abſence, ſhall weekly appoint one to note ſuch as are abſent from prayers, who ſhall daily give their names to the maſter, or in his abſence to the vice-maſter; and if any without a ſufficient cauſe to be allowed by the maſter, or in his abſence by the vice-maſter, be not preſent at prayers, he or ſhe ſhall for the firſt time forfeit one halfpenny, for the ſecond a penny, and ſo for every time after for each month, to be abated and defaulted from their allowance at the pay day happening next after ſuch their default of theſe forfeitures, one third part to be employ'd to the porter for that month, and the other two to the common cheſt; but in caſe any one without ſuch cauſe as is aforeſaid, ſhall be found to have been abſent ſeven times in one month, he ſhall for the firſt time that he is found ſo offending, forfeit all his allowance of the houſe for one fortnight; and for the ſecond time he or ſhe ſhall have an admonition ſolemnly given them by the maſter and vice-maſter, which ſhall be entred into the ledger book; but if after three ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,

For the erecting and continuing of this manufacture, I do appoint the land at Charlwood, bought of one Poleſdon, which is let for forty pounds yearly, which rent I order to be applied only to that purpoſe; and in like manner, I appoint the lands at Burſtow, bought of Mr. Biſhe, and being rented at ſixty pounds a year, to be employed ſolely for this manufacture, ſo that I do ordain, this 100<hi>l</hi> by the year ſhall not be mingled with any other money of my hoſpital, but the rent thereof to be put into a cheſt by itſelf, and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts appertaining thereunto, to be kept and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by themſelves; I appoint, that upon this cheſt be written and faſtened in paper, The Cheſt for the Manufacture, and three locks and keys ſhall be

I do not tye them that have the charge of this work to any one certain trade, but give them power at the end of the year, which I wiſh to be on the tenth or eleventh of November, to alter it if they find reaſon for the ſame, but appoint, that ſuch alteration ſhall not be, but upon great deliberation and good grounds, leaſt by too much ſhifting all comes to nothing.

and ſiſters, from All-hallowtide to Eaſter, which may amount to about; if any wood or coal be had towards this, out of the lands bought of Bromfield, it may ſave ſo much money otherwiſe; but I do order, that the ſaid lands of Bromfield be ſo diſpoſed of, that it may yield rent, or wood, or coal, to the proportion before ſet down by me, that the hoſpital may honeſtly enjoy that which I have paid for. When all theſe expences are iſſued forth, there will be a convenient ſurpluſage remaining, yearly, for the ſtock of the houſe to bear law-ſuits, reparations, or other publick charge of the hoſpital, which will be more increaſed by ſuch money as will ariſe out of the quarter's pay, which is forborne upon the coming in of every brother and ſiſter at the firſt; and this ſtock I ordain to be ſo carefully kept for the publick, that if the maſter, or any brother, ſhall take out for any employment, the value of one ſhilling, or upwards, upon any occaſion or colour, I appoint, that being convicted thereof before the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, he ſhall preſently, by the ſaid lord archbiſhop, be expelled the houſe. When this ſtock ariſeth to one hundred pounds, I would have that ſum carefully kept in gold, againſt time of extremity, and none of it to be taken out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great cauſe, and yet then upon the firſt opportunity to be made uſe of again, becauſe I hold it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that this my foundation ſhould not be without one hundred pounds lying by againſt any great need, which I hold fit to be kept as a ſecret of the houſe, and not to be revealed by the maſter, or any brother of the houſe, to any ſtranger whatſoever; the reſt which is above this hundred pound, is to be a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtock ſafely kept, but upon neceſſary occaſions

            <p>THIS learned and humble man, was born <hi>anno</hi> 1560, and bred up under the ſame ſchool-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, with his brother the Archbiſhop; till being ſufficiently qualified for the univerſity he was ſent to Baliol College in Oxford, <hi>anno</hi> 1575.</p>
            <p>In 1582, he took his Maſter of Arts degree; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a noted preacher there, alſo a conſtant lecturer at St. Martin's Church, in the Quadrivium, and ſometimes at Abingdon in Berkſhire.</p>
            <p>His preferment was remarkably owing to his merit, particularly in preaching; notwithſtanding the diſtinction which ſome have affected to make, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the talents and tempers of theſe two brothers; <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That George was the more plauſible preacher, Robert the greater ſcholar; George the abler ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Robert the deeper divine: gravity did frown in George, and ſmile in Robert:"</q> ſuch the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Robert evidently were; that upon the firſt ſermon he preached at Worceſter, he was made lecturer in that city, and ſoon after rector of All-Saints there; and upon a ſermon he preached at Paul's Croſs, he was preſented to the rich benefice of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0466800400:154"/>
Bingham in Nottinghamſhire, by one of his auditors, John Stanhope, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and it is obſerved, that <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'As dew dropping on mowen graſs refreſheth it, and maketh it ſpring anew, ſo his labours in his paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charge much refreſhed the conſciences of true converts, which had felt the ſcythe of God's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and made them <hi>ſpring</hi> up in <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of life; again, as dew diſtilling in ſilver drops mollifieth the parched ground, ſo his heart melting into tears in many penitential exhortations mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtony hearts of thoſe who had been before moſt obdurate in their ſins; and again, as dew that falls from heaven returns not thither back again, but enricheth the ſoil, and makes fruitful the earth; ſo his pains whereſoever he beſtowed them were never ſteril, but brought forth much fruit of comfort both to himſelf, and of knowledge in the myſteries of ſalvation to his hearers.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>In 1594 he became no leſs eminent for ſome of his writings; particularly, againſt a certain Papiſt, on the Sacrament. He then took his degrees in divinity; that of Doctor being completed in 1597.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the reign of King James I, he he was made chaplain in ordinary to him; and this King ſo well eſteemed of his writings, that, with the ſecond edition of Dr. Abbot's book <hi>

                  </gap>e Antichriſto,</hi> in 1608, his majeſty ordered his own commentary upon part of the Apocalypſe to be printed: an honour, which that King did to no other of the great clerks in this kingdom. And, in truth, the Doctor's pen had now brought him alſo into general eſteem, for what he had hitherto publiſhed in Defence of Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Perkins's <hi>Reformed Catholic,</hi> againſt Dr. William Biſhop, now a ſecular prieſt, but afterwards, in the Pope's ſtile, a titular Biſhop, of the Aërial Dioceſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0466800400:155"/>
of Chalcedon. It is aſſerted by Dr. Featley, in his life of Abbot, that he has herein given that William Biſhop as great an overthrow, as Jewell to Harding, Bilſon to Allen, or Reynolds to Hart. At the end of this excellent work is added a particular treatiſe, he ſoon after writ, intitled, <hi>The true ancient Roman Catholick;</hi> which he dedicated to Prince Henry; to whom it was ſo acceptable, that he returned him many thanks in a letter written with his own hand, and promiſed his aſſiſtance, upon the next vacancy, to advance him higher in the Church. And though by that Prince's untimely death the Doctor loſt ſome hopes, yet, in courſe of time, his deſerts found other friends to do him that juſtice.</p>
            <p>In 1609, he was unanimouſly elected maſter of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liol College. Here it is obſerved of him, that he was careful and ſkilful, to ſet in this nurſery the beſt plants; and then took ſuch care to water and prune them, that in no plat, or knot, throughout the Univerſity of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, there appeared more beautiful flowers, or grew ſweeter fruit, than in Baliol College, while he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. His diligent reading to his ſcholars, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual preſence at public exerciſes, both countenanced the readers, and encouraged the hearers. Theſe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and improvements he further wrought, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing piety, which had been much neglected; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring peace, which had been long wanted; and making temperance more familiar among them, which had been too great a ſtranger in that ſociety.</p>
            <p>In May 1610, we find him nominated by the King, among the firſt fellows of his majeſty's Royal College at Chelſea, then newly founded, and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a kind of fortreſs for controverſial divinity; being thus, as it were, engarriſoned, with the moſt able and ſelect champions for the Proteſtant cauſe,

againſt all aſſaults of Popery: and in November the ſame year, he was made prebendary of Normanton, in the church of Southwell.</p>
            <p>Upon his preaching a ſermon before the King, during his month of waiting at court, in 1612, when the news of Dr. Thomas Holland's death was brought from Oxford, his majeſty named him ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in the Thealogical Chair, uſually called the King's Profeſſor of Divinity; but he modeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the ſame, till his brother procured a mandate from the King for him to hold it.

                     <hi>Some notable circumſtances,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in this ſtation.</hi>] Among the reſt, while he was Profeſſor in the chair at Oxford, was, his preaching a ſermon before the univerſity; in which, he ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly laid open the oblique methods then uſed by thoſe who ſecretly favoured Popery, to undermine the Reformation; and Dr. Laud, then preſent, was ſo notoriouſly ſuſpected to be one who uſed thoſe methods, as to have the ſaid reflections applied by the whole auditory to him; that in great vexation he wrote to his patron, Dr. Neal, then Biſhop of Lincoln, (therefore about the year 1614) to know whether he ſhould not make a direct reply to it. The paſſage Laud objected to, was, that Abbot ſhould ſay, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'There were men, who, under pretence of truth, and preaching againſt the Puritans, ſtruck at the heart and root of that faith and religion now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us; which was the very practice of Parſons and Campian's counſel, when they came hither to ſeduce young ſtudents; who, afraid to be expelled, if they ſhould openly profeſs their converſion, were directed to ſpeak freely againſt the Puritans, as what would ſuffice: ſo theſe do not expect to be accounted Papiſts, becauſe they ſpeak only againſt Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; but becauſe they are indeed Papiſts, they ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt them: or if they do, they beat about the buſh, and that ſoftly too, for fear of diſquieting the birds that are in it.'</q> Hereupon, Laud, in his letter to the ſaid Biſhop of Lincoln, complains, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That he was fain to ſit patiently at the rehearſal of this ſermon, though abuſed almoſt an hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, being pointed at as he fat; yet would have taken no notice of it, but that the whole univerſity applied it to him; and his friends told him, he ſhould ſink in his credit, if he anſwered not Dr. Abbot in his own: nevertheleſs, he would be patient; and deſired his Lordſhip to vouchſafe him ſome direction.'</q> But as we hear not that Laud did anſwer it, the Biſhop might perhaps vouchſafe him rather directions to be quiet.</p>
               </note>;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0466800400:157"/>
and herein, he has had the character given him of a profound divine, moſt admirably well read in the fathers, councils, and ſchoolmen; and a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Calvinian, than either of his two predeceſſors in the divinity-chair, Holland and Humphrey, were; which he expreſſed by countenancing the Sublapſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian way of predeſtination.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, upon the King's peruſal of his <hi>Antilogia,</hi> againſt the <hi>Apology</hi> for Garnet, and the fame of his incomparable lectures in the univerſity, upon the King's ſupreme power, againſt Bellarmine and Suarez, (printed after his death) his majeſty, when the See of Saliſbury fell void, ſent his <hi>Conge d' Elire</hi> for him to the Dean and Chapter.</p>
            <p>Thus, as he ſet forward, one foot in the temple of virtue, his other ſtill advanced in the temple of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, though indeed, but leiſurely; which is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his own humility; the obſtruction of his foes, who traduced him for a Puritan, (though cordial to the doctrine of the Church of England) and the unwillingneſs of ſome friends to adorn the Church with the ſpoil of the Univerſity, and mar a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor to make a Biſhop.</p>
            <p>He was conſecrated by his own brother the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, on December 3, 1615, in his chapel at Lambeth. Herein equalizing the felicity of Seffridus, ſome time Biſhop of Chicheſter, who being a Biſhop himſelf, alſo ſaw his brother, at the ſame time Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury.</p>

Other biſhopricks were voiced upon him; but the buſineſs of the nullity before-mentioned, in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life) made a nullity for a time in his Grace's good intentions; inſomuch, that King James, when the Doctor, newly conſecrated Biſhop of Sarum, came to do his homage, ſaid pleaſantly to him, Abbot, <hi>I have had very much to do to make thee a Biſhop; but I know no reaſon for it, unleſs it were, becauſe thou haſt written againſt one;</hi> alluding to the name of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh prieſt before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>In his way to Sarum, he made a farewel oration at the univerſity, with great applauſe. We have ſome fragments of it preſerved, in the original Latin, in Hollandi Her. Angl. and Featley's Life of Abbot; and a tranſlation thereof, or epitome in Engliſh, by Lupton, in his Hiſt. of modern Proteſtant Divines. His brethren, the heads of houſes, and other Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford friends, parted with him on the edge of his dioceſe with tears for grief; and the gentry of Sarum received him with thoſe of joy. The next Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following, he offered his <hi>firſt fruits in the temple,</hi> taking for his text, the words of the Pſalmiſt 26. 8. <hi>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</hi>

            <p>After he had verified the Words of his Text in the perſon of David, his Sermon ended, he verified it in himſelf, and made a demonſtration that he loved that houſe of God, <hi>not in tongue only and in word, but in deed and verity;</hi> for obſerving the beautiful old cathedral to be much decayed, through negligence, and the covetouſneſs of thoſe who filled their purſes, with that which ſhould have ſtopped the chinks, he uſed ſuch means with the prebendaries, as drew from them five hundred pounds, which he applied to the reparation of the church; and then laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair

the congregation, both by doctrine and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, viſiting his whole dioceſe in perſon, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching every Sabbath-day, whilſt his health would permit, either in the city, or in the neighbouring towns; but this was not long, for my author tells us, that preaching on John 14. v. 16. <hi>I will pray the father and he ſhall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,</hi> many of his hearers, preſaged his departure from them; ſo indeed it proved his laſt and farewel ſermon, for ſoon after he came out of the pulpit, he was ſeized with moſt dreadful fits of the ſtone in the kidneys, which were brought on by that ſedentary courſe he had accuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omed himſelf to, by his cloſe application to ſtudy, ſo that his hour-glaſs, contrary to others, the <hi>ſooner ran out, by being ſtopped.</hi> But in all the bodily tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his laſt fit, his ſoul was at eaſe; for the aſſurance of heavenly things, cauſed him moſt chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to part with earthly, and the quick ſenſe he had of the <hi>powers of the life to come</hi> deaded the ſenſe of his bodily pains.

Having, when death approached, ſummoned his domeſticks, and with broken ſpeeches in the language of a dying man, beginning to make a profeſſion of his faith, his

friends perſuaded him to refrain, it being manifeſt in his writings; he yielded to their advice, and ſigned all his works with theſe words; <hi>That faith which I have defended in my writings, is the truth of God; and in the avouching thereof I leave the World.</hi> Thus with exhortations, benedictions, and the pains of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, quite worn out, he lay as it were ſlumbering, with now and then a ſhort ejaculation; and at length, with eyes and hands uplifted for the ſpace of two or three hours, after ſome weeks continuance in that dreadful diſorder, he gave up the ghoſt, on March the 2d, 1617, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, with theſe words; <hi>Come Lord Jeſu, come quickly, finiſh in me the work that thou haſt begun; into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my ſpirit, for thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me: O God of truth, ſave me thy ſervant, who hopes and confides in thee alone: let thy mercy, O Lord, he ſhewn unto me: in thee have I truſted, O Lord, let me not be confounded for ever.</hi>

            <head>
               <pb facs="tcp:0466800400:164"/>THE LIFE OF Sir MORRIS ABBOT.</head>
            <p>MORRIS ABBOT, the youngeſt ſon of Mr. Maurice Abbot, of Guildford, and brother to Robert and George beforementioned, was bred up to trade, and became an eminent merchant in the city of London, but was more remarkably diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, by his applying himſelf to the direction of the affairs of the Eaſt-India company, and his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt attention to whatever might promote the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive commerce of this nation, or ſtrengthen her fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign colonies.</p>
            <p>In this quality, we find him one of the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners employed in the negotiation and concluſion of a treaty with the Dutch Eaſt-India company, by which the Molucca Iſlands, and the commerce to them, is declared to be two thirds belonging to the Dutch Eaſt-India company, and one to the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>This treaty was concluded at London, on the ſeventh of July, 1019, and ratified by King James, the ſixteenth of the ſame month, and is as remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a tranſaction as any in that reign.</p>
            <p>It was in conſequence of this treaty, and in order to recover the goods of ſome Engliſh merchants, that Sir Dudley Diggs, and Morris Abbot, were ſent over into Holland, in the ſucceeding year, 1620, but with what ſucceſs does not appear.</p>
            <p>He was afterwards one of the farmers of the cuſtoms, as appears from a commiſſion granted in 1623, to him and to many other perſons, for adminiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0466800400:165"/>
the oaths to ſuch perſons, as ſhould either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to paſs the ſeas from this kingdom, or to enter it from foreign countries.</p>
            <p>In the ſucceeding year, 1624, he was appointed one of the council, for ſettling and eſtabliſhing the colony of Virginia, with very full powers for the government of that colony, as by that commiſſion appears.</p>
            <p>On the acceſſion of King Charles I, to the throne, Mr. Abbot was the firſt perſon upon whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the honour of knighthood, and ſo great was his intereſt at that time in the city, that we find him choſen to the firſt parliament called in that King's reign, <hi>viz.</hi> in 1625, in conjunction with Sir Thomas Middleton, Sir Heneage Finch, and Mr. Robert Bateman.</p>
            <p>In 1627, he was one of the Sheriffs of London, with Henry Garway; Sir Cuthbert Hacket, being then Mayor.</p>
            <p>About the year 1635, he erected the monument to the memory of his brother the Archbiſhop, in his native town of Guildford.</p>
            <p>In 1638 he was Lord-Mayor of the city of Lond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; on which account <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>here was publiſhed by Sir T. Heywood, a deſcription of his ſolemn entry.</p>
            <p>On the tenth of January, 1640, he departed this life. No farther particulars are to be met with, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that he was a great lover and encourager of trade, as well as fortunate therein.</p>
            <p>He had a ſon whoſe name was George, fellow of Merton college in Oxford, and who took the degree of Bachelor of Law in 1630.</p>
