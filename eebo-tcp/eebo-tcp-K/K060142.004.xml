            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SCOTLAND</hi> is bounded on the North by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea and <hi>England,</hi> from which it is divided by <hi>Solway Firth,</hi> and the Rivers <hi>Eſk</hi> and <hi>Kexſop</hi>; on the Weſt Border, by the <hi>Cheviot</hi> Hills in the <hi>Middle Marches</hi>; and by the lower Parts of the <hi>Tweed,</hi> on the Eaſt Border. On the Eaſt it is bounded by the <hi>German</hi> Sea; on the North by the <hi>Deucaledonian</hi> Sea; and on the Weſt, by the great Weſtern Ocean.</p>
               <p>Its greateſt Length from <hi>Dungſby-head</hi> or <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Grot</hi>'s-<hi>houſe</hi> in <hi>Caithneſs,</hi> to the <hi>Mull</hi> of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi> towards <hi>Ireland,</hi> is no more than about 215 <hi>Scots</hi> Miles; but if we reckon directly North from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0141100404:4"/>
                  <hi>Dumfries,</hi> or the ſaid <hi>Mull</hi> of <hi>Galloway,</hi> to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Parts of <hi>Caithneſs,</hi> or <hi>Strathnavern,</hi> the Length will not be ſo much; and leſs ſtill, if we reckon from <hi>Berwick</hi> to either of theſe Places.</p>
               <p>Its Breadth, from the Point of <hi>Ard-na-murchan</hi> near the Iſle of <hi>Mull,</hi> about the middle Part of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Weſt, to <hi>Buchan-neſs</hi> in the Eaſt Parts, towards the North, is about 140 <hi>Scots</hi> Miles; but the Sea running up into the Land, or the Land thruſting out into the Sea in many Places, makes the Breadth of it every-where elſe very various and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable; for in the South Parts it is ſeldom 100 Miles over, and in the North Parts, beyond <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs,</hi> not ſo many; ſo that there is no Houſe above 40 or 45 Miles from ſalt Water.</p>
               <p>Beſides the main Land, there are about 300 Iſlands, ſome of them very conſiderable, which may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into ſeveral Claſſes: The Weſtern Iſlands called <hi>Hebrides,</hi> or <hi>Aebudae,</hi> by <hi>Latin</hi> Authors; the <hi>Orcades,</hi> or <hi>Orkney</hi> Iſlands: the Iſlands of <hi>Shetland,</hi> or <hi>Zetland,</hi> and ſome few in the Firth of <hi>Forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Country abounds in Lakes and Rivers, many whereof running into Creeks and Arms of the Sea, (which in ſeveral Places are very wide and deep) afford great and commodious Opportunities for Fiſhing and Shipping: But 'tis much to be regretted, that the Land is neither cultivated, nor the Fiſhing and Shipping carried on and improved, to ſo much Advantage as might be expected.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Soil is not generally ſo level and fruitful as that of <hi>England,</hi> yet the South Parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> are far more pleaſant than, and preferable to, the North Parts of <hi>England</hi>; and there are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where all Things neceſſary for human Life: And not only ſufficient for the Inhabitants, but alſo to export and exchange for ſuch foreign Commodities as the People want, and to return conſiderable Sums.</p>

               <head>II. Of the moſt remarkable Lakes and Rivers in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE moſt remarkable Lakes in <hi>Scotland</hi> are <hi>Loch-tay,</hi> and <hi>Loch-neſs,</hi> and <hi>Loch-levin:</hi> Which all ſend forth Rivers of the ſame Name with themſelves: <hi>Loch-lomond,</hi> which ſends forth the River of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>; and <hi>Loch-iern,</hi> which ſends the River <hi>Iern.</hi> 'Tis obſerved, that <hi>Loch-neſs, Loch-tay,</hi> and <hi>Loch-iern,</hi> ſeldom freeze.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Loch-myrton</hi> in <hi>Galloway</hi> is another, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for this, That one Part of it generally freezes in the Winter-ſeaſon, and the other Part ſeldom does.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Loch</hi> in <hi>Straith-errach,</hi> in the Lord <hi>Lovat</hi>'s Lands, which never freezes, however ſevere the Froſt be, till <hi>February</hi>; and then, in one Night's time, it freezes all over; and if the Froſt continue two Nights, the Ice grows very thick. There is a Lake of the ſame Nature call'd <hi>Lochmonar,</hi> in the Earl of <hi>Cromarty</hi>'s Lands in the North; and there is another Lake in <hi>Straglaſh,</hi> at a Place call'd <hi>Glencanich,</hi> in a high Ground betwixt the Tops of two Mountains, the middle of which Lake is always frozen through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Summer, notwithſtanding the ſtrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions of the Sun-beams from the Mountains, which melt the Ice at the Sides of the Lake. The Ground round the Lake has a conſtant Verdure, as if there were a perpetual Spring; and Cattle grow ſooner fat by that Graſs than any-where elſe: And this is ſo much the more remarkable, that there are ſeveral other Lakes in the Neighbourhood, of as high a Situation, wherein no ſuch thing is ſeen.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Linlithgowſhire</hi> is a Lake call'd <hi>Loch-coat Lough,</hi> from whence a Stream runs under a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Mountain, the Murmur of which is heard among the Stones; and after it has run thus under
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0141100404:6"/>
Ground for about two hundred Paces, it iſſues with great Force from a Fountain about three Feet broad, and forms a Stream which turns a Water-mill.</p>
               <p>For the Conveniency of Trade and Fiſhing, there are ſo many Inlets of the Sea, that there is ſcarce any Part of it, as I have ſaid, above 40 Miles diſtant from ſome Bay, Creek, or Arm of the Ocean; and theſe afford many Harbours, ſeveral of them very good, and capable of receiving Men of War, and Ships of the greateſt Burden.</p>
               <p>The principal Rivers in <hi>Scotland</hi> are TAY, which divides it in the Middle, and running by <hi>Scone, Perth,</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> empties itſelf into the <hi>German</hi> Ocean. In the Southern Parts, the FORTH and TWEED run into the ſame; CLYDE runs into the Weſtern Sea; as ESK, ANNAND, NITH, KEN, DEE, and CREE, do into the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> In the North, DEE and DON run into the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, as SPEY and NESS do into <hi>Murray</hi> Firth.</p>
               <p>The moſt convenient for Trade are TAY, which is navigable to <hi>Perth</hi>; FORTH and CLYDE, which, if join'd by a Canal, near the Place where the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> formerly built their Wall of about 30 Miles long, to defend their Province from the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> would open a Communication betwixt the Eaſt and Weſt Seas, to the great Advancement of the Commerce of the whole Iſland. There was much Talk of it about the Time of the <hi>Union</hi>; but as it would undoubtedly be attended with very great Charges, and other Difficulties, the Project ſeems to be laid quite aſide.</p>
               <p>I am the briefer in my Account of the Lakes and Rivers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe I ſhall be obliged to be more particular upon them in their reſpective Places.</p>

               <p>THE Salmon-fiſhery is particularly the Boaſt and Delight of the <hi>Scots</hi>; inſomuch that for it they too much neglect all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Their SALMON are accounted the beſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> and tho' their Barrels be a Third leſs than that of <hi>Berwick,</hi> yet they have yielded 10 Livres more <hi>per</hi> Barrel, in <hi>France</hi>; partly becauſe of their Goodneſs, and partly becauſe better cured, wherein the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Town-council of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> take a very particular Care. Salmon abound not only in the navigable Rivers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but in thoſe which are leſs, in moſt Parts of the Kingdom; and they valued them ſo much formerly, that in ſeveral of their old Acts of Parliament they forbad ſelling them to <hi>England,</hi> except for Gold. <hi>Clyde</hi> abounds with Salmon, for which the Town of <hi>Renfrew</hi> has been famous; and Biſhop <hi>Leſley,</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſays, They uſed, in his Time, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſixty Veſſels in Fiſhing moſt of Spring and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but 'tis much ſhort of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> where the ſame Author ſays, the Rivers <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Don</hi> exceed all thoſe of the Kingdom for Number and Goodneſs of Salmon: For which he aſſigns this Reaſon, That they delight in clear Streams, which occaſions our Rivers in <hi>Scotland</hi> to abound more with Salmon than thoſe of other Countries where the Rivers are more muddy. The other Places, moſt remarkable for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-fiſhing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> are in the <hi>Dovern</hi> at <hi>Bamf,</hi> the Rivers <hi>Neſſe, Nairn, Findorn, Loſſey</hi> and <hi>Spey</hi> in <hi>Murray</hi>; the latter abounds with Salmon for 60 Miles together. <hi>Lochlomond</hi> in <hi>Lenox</hi> is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Salmon of an excellent Taſte, <hi>Loch-ou</hi> in <hi>Argyll,</hi> the like: And there is good Salmon-fiſhing in the Rivers <hi>Lough</hi> and <hi>Speynie</hi> in <hi>Lochaber,</hi> in the

Bay of <hi>Cromarty,</hi> near <hi>Dingwal</hi> Caſtle, and in the Rivers <hi>Tay</hi> and <hi>Tweed,</hi> and other ſmaller Rivers in the bordering Counties. They have marl'd or ſpeckled Salmon in <hi>Harries, North-viſt</hi> and <hi>Benbecula.</hi> And in the Iſle of <hi>Sky,</hi> there are no leſs than 30 Rivers all abounding with Salmon.</p>
               <p>As to their COD-fiſhing, Mr. <hi>Spruel</hi> (an eminent <hi>Scots</hi> Merchant, who laid an Account of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Kingdom for Trade before their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome Years ago) ſays, he was inform'd by a <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Man, who uſe to buy thoſe Fiſh and Salt on the <hi>Scots</hi> Coaſt, that he has ſometimes got four thouſand cur'd Fiſh in a Voyage, at 1<hi>d.</hi> or 2<hi>d.</hi> apiece, and retail'd them again from 18<hi>d.</hi> to 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> apiece; which ſhews what vaſt Advantage might be made of this Trade, ſince the <hi>Scots</hi> Cod are reckon'd as good or better than thoſe of <hi>Newfoundland.</hi> And what contibutes much to the Cheapneſs of this and the Herring-fiſhery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is, that they are caught with fewer Hands, and Veſſels of far leſs Expence, than Doggers, which muſt be well mann'd and ſtrong, becauſe oblig'd to lie at Sea; whereas the <hi>Scots</hi> catch thoſe Fiſh in their own Creeks, Bays and Harbours, where few Hands and open Veſſels are for the moſt part ſufficient, becauſe they are ſeldom expoſed to any Danger by Storms, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways near the Shore, and laid up at Night.</p>
               <p>HERRINGS abound on all the Coaſts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but eſpecially on the Weſtern Iſles, which are reckon'd the beſt and fatteſt, tho' not ſo large as thoſe taken on the Eaſtern and Northern Coaſts. The <hi>Scots</hi> Herring-fiſhing is accounted the beſt in the World, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> have got a great Part of their Wealth by it.</p>
               <p>A Fiſhery was attempted in the Iſles by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. in Conjunction with ſome Merchants; and a Magazine was erected for that Uſe in <hi>Hermetra,</hi> one of the <hi>Harries</hi> Iſlands, and another in the Iſle of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0141100404:9"/>
                  <hi>Vackſay</hi>; but the unhappy Civil War coming on, it was not proſecuted. It was renew'd by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and ſucceeded well for a Time: The Fiſh they caught were accounted the beſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> and yielded a Price accordingly; but the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his Money afterwards, to ſupply his preſſing Occaſions, the Merchants were diſpleaſed at it, and differing among themſelves, did alſo withdraw theirs; which ruin'd the Deſign.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Dutch</hi> Families ſettled in the Village of <hi>Stornway,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Lewes,</hi> ſoon after that Prince's Reſtoration; and ſo much improved the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in the Fiſhing Trade, during the ſmall Time of their Abode there, that they ſtill exceed all thoſe of the neighbouring Iſles and Continent; they brought the Natives a great deal of Money likewiſe, for their Sea and Land-Fowl: But King <hi>Charles</hi> II. being prevail'd on to ſend away the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it was a great Loſs to the Country.</p>
               <p>Herrings are ſometimes bought in the Iſles for 6<hi>d. per</hi> Barrel, and when cured and ſent abroad, yield from 25 to 40<hi>s. per</hi> Barrel; and ſometimes 36000 Barrels of white Herrings have been exported to <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Clyde</hi> in a Seaſon, beſides what were exported from <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and other Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to <hi>France,</hi> and other Nations; which may ſerve as a Specimen to ſhew how capable that Trade is of Improvement, eſpecially conſidering the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Weſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Iſles, from whence they may be a Month ſooner at Market with them, than from any Part of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>; which, with the Advantage of taking and curing them cheaper and ſooner than the <hi>Dutch</hi> can poſſibly do, conſidering how far they have to ſail backward and forward, what Riſques they run at Sea, and what Numbers of Tenders they are obliged to ſend to and again betwixt their own Country, and their Doggers with Proviſions, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they might ſoon be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done

in that profitable Trade by the Inhabitants of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who may lie aſhore at Night, and land their Fiſh as ſoon as caught, without any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from Tempeſts or Enemies; many of thoſe Bays where the Herring abound, being very ſafe for Ships to ride in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whales</hi> in abundance frequent the Iſlands of <hi>Flad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Orkney</hi> and <hi>Lewes:</hi> One hundred and fourteen run aſhore on the Iſland of <hi>Orkney</hi> at one time, in the Year 1691.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cod, Tuſk,</hi> and <hi>Ling,</hi> are caught in vaſt Plenty upon all their Coaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haddocks, Sturgeon, Turbut, Trouts, Perch, Pike, Scate, Greyberd, Maycril, Keeling, Whiting, Sea-urchin, Cat-fiſh, Cockpadle, Lyths, Spirlings, Soles, Flukes, Garvie, Eels,</hi> are alſo caught on the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Coaſts in great Plenty, for Home-conſumption.</p>

                  <hi>Otters,</hi> whoſe Skins are uſeful for Muffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are very numerous in the Iſles.</p>
               <p>Shell-fiſh of all ſorts, as <hi>Lobſters, Crabs, Oyſters,</hi> are alſo found in vaſt Quantities in the Weſtern Iſlands; the latter ſo large, that they muſt be cut in three or four Pieces, to be eaten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cockles, Muſcles, Limpets, Wilks, Scollops,</hi> and <hi>Spouts,</hi> are caſt up by the Tide in ſuch Numbers on the Iſles, that the People cannot conſume them.</p>
               <p>PEARL being the Product of Fiſh, it is proper to diſcourſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> Pearl here. Mr. <hi>Spruel,</hi> the Merchant above-mentioned, who underſtood the Pearl-trade beſt of any Man in that Kingdom, having dealt in it above forty Years, ſays, He has ſometimes given a hundred Rixdollars, which is near 25<hi>l.</hi> for one <hi>Scots</hi> Pearl; and that he had <hi>Scots</hi> Pearl as fine, clear, and more tranſparent, than any Oriental Pearl. Tho' the latter be more eaſily match'd, becauſe they are all of a yellow Water, yet Foreigners covet <hi>Scots</hi> Pearl. The more Wrinkles there are in a Pearl-ſhell, the more Sign it is of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0141100404:11"/>
Age and Goodneſs of a Pearl; for the ſmooth Shells are young and barren: Therefore he propoſed, that a Law ſhould be made to forbid the Fiſhing of young Pearl; for the longer they ſtay in the Water, the more valuable they are: So that he would have no Shells taken up leſs than four Inches in Length, or two or three in Breadth; and that none ſhould be allowed to offer any Pearl to be ſold, that weighs leſs than five Grains; which is as reaſonable as Laws to prevent the taking of the young Fry of Salmon, ſince Pearl are of much more Value. And that they might have Time to grow and increaſe, he propoſes, That Pearl-fiſhing ſhould be forbid, except once in ten Years at leaſt; becauſe he has been ſorry to ſee ſome Thouſands of young Pearls offer'd to Sale, that were of no manner of Value; whereas, had they lain in the Waters their due Time, they might have been worth from four to fifty Crowns apiece.</p>
               <p>Pearl is found in moſt Places of the Nation where Salmon are taken; and once in twenty Years, he ſays, there is a great Pearl-fiſhing in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This does not hinder, but that Pearl-ſhells of the Size he propoſes, or larger, may be taken up at any time when found; and theſe are probably to be had among the unfrequented Iſles.</p>
               <p>Particular Places where Pearl abound, are the Rivers in the Iſle of <hi>Skye,</hi> where they are frequently found in black Muſcles, eſpecially in the Rivers <hi>Kilmartin</hi> and <hi>Ord,</hi> where Pearls have lately been found of 20<hi>l. per</hi> Piece; and in a freſh-water Lake near the South-ſide of <hi>Loch-einardſtad.</hi> In that ſame Iſland there are alſo Muſcles that breed Pearl.</p>
               <p>Tho' the ſmall Pearl be not ſo uſeful for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet they may be of very good Uſe in Phyſick, and make a fine Article in the Apothecary's Bills, being reputed the chief of all Cordials, and very good againſt the Plague, violent and peſtilential Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Fluxes, Heart-burning, Giddineſs of the Head,

               </head>
               <p>THE Country in general abounds in Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of Cattle; which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally black, except in Corn-ſoils, where they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom breed or keep any more than are neceſſary for the Plough or the Pail. But 'tis obſervable, that ſuch as are bred in the Corn-countries, are much larger than thoſe bred in other Parts, and equal in Size to thoſe bred in ſome Parts of <hi>England,</hi> even where the Land ſeems to be better.</p>
               <p>In general, their Sheep and Cattle are much ſmaller than thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in Paſture-lands; yet are they of a far ſweeter and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Taſte. The <hi>Highlanders</hi> bring great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them yearly into the Lowlands, where ſome are fatted; but the Bulk of them, and alſo many of thoſe bred in the Lowlands, are ſent into divers Parts of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially to <hi>St. Faith's</hi> near <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> where they turn out to good Account; as I have obſerved in its Place.</p>
               <p>They have alſo very many <hi>Hogs,</hi> and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Number of <hi>Goats,</hi> particularly in the North and Highlands; the latter they eat themſelves, but the former they pickle and export, as they likewiſe do vaſt Quantities of <hi>ſalt Beef.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Southern Counties there are no <hi>Deer,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Gentlemens Parks; but every-where elſe, they are in great Plenty.</p>
               <p>They breed great Numbers of <hi>Horſes,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Galloway</hi> and the <hi>Highlands</hi>; ſmall indeed, but capable of great Fatigue, eſpecially if we conſider,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0141100404:13"/>
that they are not only more proper for the Saddle, and other Uſes in that Country, which, being hilly, will not admit, in many Places, of Teams and Carriages; but are more hardy than Horſes of a larger Size, and will thrive upon what would ſtarve great Horſes. Nevertheleſs, in many Places of the <hi>Lowlands</hi> they can breed Horſes fit for War, Coach, or Carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> has not only Plenty of <hi>domeſtick Fowl,</hi> ſuch as are common to other Countries; but many that are peculiar to themſelves, eſpecially in the Iſlands, where they are in ſuch Multitudes as the Inhabitants can neither conſume nor vend half of them; but their Trade for them will ſtill increaſe, as it has done ſince the <hi>Union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Fowl</hi> and <hi>Eggs</hi> afford a large Fund of Trade for Food, and their <hi>Feathers</hi> for Bedding and other Uſes: Their Fat is made uſe of by the Inhabitants not only in many Caſes where Oil is neceſſary, but likewiſe for Phyſick.</p>

               <p>Their HEMP is alſo capable of being improved, not only to ſave Money in the Iſland, which is exported for <hi>Canvas, Sailcloth,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo to export, and to make <hi>Nets</hi> for their Fiſhery, and other Uſes.</p>
               <p>The numerous and large Flocks of Sheep they have in <hi>Scotland</hi> produce abundance of WOOL, from whence come Manufactures of ſeveral Sorts; as <hi>Broad-cloth, Coarſe</hi> or <hi>Houſewife's-cloth, Fingrims, Serges, Bays, Crapes, Temmin,</hi> Glaſgow <hi>Plaids, Worſted Camblets,</hi> and other Stuffs and <hi>Stockens</hi> for Home-conſumption and Export; beſides their <hi>Tallow</hi> and <hi>Skins.</hi> Their Wool in general is not ſo good as that of <hi>England</hi>; yet they have brought their Broad-cloth lately to a great Perfection, but can never equal <hi>England</hi> in that Part of Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture: Nevertheleſs it is very proper for <hi>Serges, Bays, Camblets, Shaloons,</hi> and other Stuffs; and by due Regulation is capable of great Improvement for a foreign Trade.

               </head>
               <p>THE more remarkable Medicinal Fountains in <hi>Scotland</hi> are <hi>Moffat Wells,</hi> which ſpring from the Top of a Rock near the Town of that Name in <hi>Annandale.</hi> The Wells are two in Number, near one another; the higher Well runs through whitiſh and cryſtalline Stones, and the lower through black ones, reſembling Marcaſites of Antimony: The Smell of the Water is like that of Gunpowder, and it dyes Silver of a black Colour. To the Stones of the upper Well grows a Matter reſembling ſtinking Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Antimony, of a yellowiſh red Colour; the Stones of the lower Well are of the Colour of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, and ſome of them contain a metallick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſparkles like Antimony. Where the Stream of the lower Well runs down into a neighbouring Brook, there ſticks to the Rock a whitiſh Salt, and perhaps a nitrous Matter, which has the diuretick Virtue of the Water. Thoſe Waters alſo purge by Stool and Vomit, and are very good againſt Colick and Nephritick Pains, becauſe they powerfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0141100404:19"/>
the Obſtructions of the Bowels. They are outwardly applied to Ulcers, and againſt Pains in the Joints; they are ſtrongeſt in their Operation in the drieſt Seaſon of the Summer and Autumn, but are not ſo good in a rainy, or in the Winter-ſeaſon.</p>

                  <hi>Mahon</hi>'s <hi>Well,</hi> near St. <hi>Mahon</hi>'s Church, has the ſame Virtue, but does not operate ſo ſtrongly; and there is a Well of the ſame Nature diſcover'd not many Years ago at <hi>Hallyards,</hi> within ſix Miles of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

               <p>At <hi>Kinghorne</hi> a very clear and cold Water flows from the Clefts of a Rock, which quickly paſſes through the Body; is of excellent Uſe for recovering a loſt Appetite, and againſt the Gravel and Stone; it is outwardly applied to watry and itching Eyes, and againſt Redneſs and Pimples in the Face: The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dr. <hi>P.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arthrey Well,</hi> two Miles North of <hi>Stirling,</hi> flows from a Mountain; where is a Copper Mine, with ſome Mixture of Gold and Silver: The Water is very cold, and being tinctur'd with the Minerals it flows through, is of Uſe againſt outward Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Glenelg,</hi> at a Place called <hi>Achignigle,</hi> is a Stream which turns Holly into a greeniſh Stone of which they make Moulds for caſting Muſket-bullets, and Melting-pots for melting Braſs, and other Metals, and Whirls for Womens Spindles.</p>
               <p>There is a petrifying Fountain near the Caſtle of <hi>Slaine,</hi> the Water of which, dropping from a natural Cave, preſently turns into Pyramids of Stones, which are brittle, and make good Lime; there is another in <hi>Hamilton</hi> Wood, the Stones made by which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble putrid Moſs.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Monkton,</hi> near <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> is a Well, called <hi>The routing Well</hi>; becauſe of the Noiſe it makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tempeſts, from the Part of the Well which

looks to that Quarter of the Sky, from whence the Tempeſt is to blow.</p>
               <p>There is another on the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Campſey</hi> Hills, which divides <hi>Stirlingſhire</hi> from <hi>Lenox</hi>; whoſe Water makes People drunk.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Scots</hi> are divided into HIGHLANDERS, who call themſelves the antient <hi>Scots</hi>; and into LOWLANDERS, who are a Mixture of antient <hi>Scots, Picts, Britons, French, Engliſh, Danes, Germans, Hungarians,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buchanan</hi> deſcribes the Cuſtoms of the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> graphically thus: In their Diet, Apparel, and Houſhold-furniture they follow the Parſimony of the Ancients; they provide their Diet by Fiſhing and Hunting, and boil their Fleſh in the Paunch or Skin of a Beaſt: While they hunt, they eat it raw, after having ſqueez'd out the Blood. Their Drink is the Broth of boil'd Meat, or Whey they keep ſome Years, and drink it plentifully in their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; but moſt of them drink Water. Their Bread is of <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Barley,</hi> the only Grain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in their Country, which they prepare very artfully: They eat a little of it in the Morning, and contenting themſelves with that, hunt, or go about their Buſineſs without eating any more till Night. They delight moſt in Cloaths of ſeveral Colours, eſpecially ſtrip'd; the Colours they affect moſt, are Purple and Blue. Their Anceſtors, as do moſt of them ſtill, made uſe of Plaids very much variegated; but now they make them rather of dark Colours, reſembling that of the Crops of Heath, that they may not be diſcovered while they lie in the Heaths waiting for their Game. Being rather wrapped up than co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with thoſe Plaids, they endure all the Rigours of the Seaſons, and ſometimes ſleep covered all over
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0141100404:22"/>
with Snow. At Home they lie upon the Ground, having under them Fern or Heath (covered with a Sheet or Blanket); the latter laid with the Roots undermoſt, ſo as it is almoſt equal to Feathers for Softneſs, but much more healthful; for the Quality of Heath being to draw out ſuperfluous Humours, when they lie down weary and faint upon it at Night, they riſe freſh and vigorous in the Morning. They affect this hard way of ſleeping; and if at any time they come into other Places of the Country, where there is better Accommodation, they pull the Coverings off the Bed, and lie down upon them wrapped in their Plaids, leſt they ſhould be ſpoiled by this barbarous Effeminacy, as they call it.</p>
               <p>The LOWLANDERS partake much of the Temper of the People, of whom we have mentioned them to be compoſed, but moſt reſemble the <hi>French,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the long League betwixt the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their mutual Commerce, frequent Intermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and Cuſtom of travelling into <hi>France</hi> to ſtudy the Law, and other Sciences, and by their affecting to ſerve in the <hi>French</hi> Armies.

               <head>XII. Of the Order of the <hi>Thiſtle,</hi> or St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Order of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> or the <hi>Thiſtle,</hi> by reaſon of its great Antiquity, and memorable Inſtitution, is, upon all Occaſions, called, <hi>The moſt Antient and moſt Noble Order of the Thiſtle,</hi> being founded, as all the <hi>Scots</hi> Hiſtorians aſſert, by <hi>Achaius</hi> the 65th King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> after a ſignal Victory obtained over the <hi>Saxons, Anno</hi> 819. and dedicated to St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> the Patron or tutelar Saint of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Order came at length to ſhine forth in fuller Splendor in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> V. who was himſelf a moſt ſplendid and magnificent Prince. He cauſed the Collar of the Order to be compoſed of two antient Badges or Symbols of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi>; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Thiſtle,</hi> and <hi>Sprigs</hi> of <hi>Rue</hi>; but about the Time of the Reformation it fell into Deſuetude, and was ſcarcely uſed by the Knights then; being ſo very zealous for the Reformed Religion, that they left their Order where they laid down their Popery, and it was never after reaſſumed till the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> VII. who, for the better regulating of the Order in all its Proceedings, ſigned a Body of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and appointed the Knights Brethren to wear the Image of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> upon a blue watered tabby Ribband; and likewiſe named the Royal Chapel, or Abbey Church of <hi>Holy-rood-houſe,</hi> to be the Chapel of the Order (the old Church of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> being ruined at the Reformation); for which End it was put in excellent Repair, but was diveſted of all its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Ornaments by a furious Rabble at the late Revolution.</p>
               <p>Her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the ſaid Order upon the 31ſt of <hi>December</hi> 1703. and ſigned a Body of Statutes, wherein the Colour

of the Ribband was charged from Blue to Green, to make a Diſtinction between this Order, and that of the <hi>Garter:</hi> all which Statut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And tho' from the Time of the Reformation, both Elections and Inſtallments had been diſpenſed with, his Majeſty was pleaſed to order, that for the future Chapters for Election ſhall be held in the Royal Preſence; to which End he commanded the great Wardrobe to provide the Knights Brethren, and Officers of the Order, with ſuch Mantles, as are appointed by the Statutes of the Order.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM juſt now entered <hi>Scotland</hi> by the ordinary Way of <hi>Berwick,</hi> which ſtands on the North Side of the River <hi>Tweed,</hi> and has a Bridge by which it is joined to <hi>Northumberland.</hi> It was originally a <hi>Scots</hi> Town, and is to this Day no Part of <hi>England</hi>; but has divers diſtinct Cuſtoms and Privileges, and is mentioned in all Statutes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations as a Place or Liberty of itſelf, diſtinct from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> It was formerly the chief Town of the <hi>Merſe,</hi> which to this Day is called the Shire of <hi>Berwick.</hi> It was often taken from, and retaken by the <hi>Scots</hi>; but the laſt time it fell into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hands, which was long before the Union of the Two Crowns in the Perſon of King <hi>James</hi> VI. they fortified it more ſtrongly than it had been formerly, and manned it with a ſufficient Gariſon, ſo that all the Attempts of the <hi>Scots</hi> to regain it afterwards, proved ineffectual. It is a Place of no extraordinary
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0141100404:44"/>
Trade, tho' a great Thorough-fare. It has but one Church, which is under the Juriſdiction of the Biſhop, and in the Gift of the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Durham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as we get out of the Town, we enter on <hi>Scots</hi> Ground, tho', in Times of War, it uſed to be part of what was called <hi>Debateable Land,</hi> and on that Account but thinly inhabited; for the Borderers of each Kingdom often made Inroads on one another, notwithſtanding that a great Number of Men, at an incredible Trouble and Expence, kept Watch every Night; beſides which, there were Watch-towers all along the Borders at proper Diſtances, and ſeveral Laws relating to the Borders made by Commiſſioners from both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing we obſerved was the Sea on the Right-hand, and the River <hi>Tweed,</hi> which fetches a Reach Northward, on the Left. The Land between lies ſo high, that in ſtormy Weather 'tis very bleak and unpleaſant, having little or no Shelter: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Land, compared to what we left in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> or what we ſoon found farther in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is good.</p>
            <p>The firſt Town in <hi>Scotland</hi> is <hi>Mordington,</hi> a poor ſorry Village; yet gives the Title of Lord to a Branch of the noble Family of <hi>Douglas.</hi> The preſent Lord lives in <hi>England,</hi> and is ſo well known, that I need ſay no more of him.</p>
            <p>From the Brow of a very high and ſteep Hill, we had a large View into <hi>Scotland</hi>; but we were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed to it by ſuch a Guſt of Wind, that it obliged us to quit our Horſes in real Apprehenſion of being blown off; beſides, the Wind blowing full North, and the Road turning toward the ſame Quarter, it blew directly in our Faces. I can truly ſay, I never was ſenſible of ſo exceeding keen and ſharp a Cold; for it pierced our very Eyes, ſo that we could ſcarcely keep them open.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0141100404:45"/>When we went down the Hill, the firſt Town we came to is almoſt as perfectly <hi>Scots,</hi> as if you were an hundred Miles North of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; and there is very little Appearance of any thing <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, either in Cuſtoms, Habits, Uſages of the People, or in their way of Living, Eating, or Behaviour. And there are very few <hi>Engliſh</hi> Familes to be found among them.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, you have in <hi>England</hi> abundance of <hi>Scots</hi> Men, <hi>Scots</hi> Cuſtoms, Words, Habits, and Uſages; nay, even the Buildings in the Towns and Villages all over <hi>Northumberland</hi> imitate the <hi>Scots</hi>; witneſs their building their Houſes with the Stairs going up to the ſecond Story on the Outſide of the Houſe, that one Family may live below, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other above, without going in at the ſame Door (which is the <hi>Scots</hi> way of Living); as you may ſee in <hi>Alnwick, Wirkworth,</hi> and ſeveral other Towns; witneſs alſo their ſetting their Corn in great Numbers of ſmall Stacks without Doors, not making uſe of Barns, but only a particular Building, which they call a Barn, tho' no more than a Threſhing-floor, into which they rake one of theſe ſmall Stacks at a time, and threſh it out.</p>
            <p>The firſt Town is called <hi>Ayton,</hi> from the ſmall River <hi>Ay,</hi> on whoſe Bank it ſtands. The Church was ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and quite deſtitute of a Roof. The Heritors being of different Opinions, contributed not a little to the Dilapidation. Such as were epiſcopally inclined were very backward in contributing their Share, and the Preſbyterians thought it hard the Whole ſhould lie upon them; ſo that, between the two, the Roof fell to the Ground. However, the Miniſter preached in a Barn to the Generality of the Pariſhioners, and ſuch as were otherwiſe inclined, heard Epiſcopal Miniſters in the Houſes of ſome of the neighbouring Gentry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0141100404:46"/>About Three Miles farther Eaſt is a ſmall Harbour, with a Town called <hi>Eymouth, Aymouth,</hi> or <hi>Haymouth,</hi> where a Fort was formerly raiſed to curb the Gariſon of <hi>Berwick.</hi> This Town gave Title of Baron to the late Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi>; but the Patent being granted only to him, and the Heirs-male of his own Body, the Honour extinguiſhed with him. It is a good Fiſhing-town, and affords a good Harbour for Fiſhing-veſſels. In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, the <hi>French</hi> held it, and fortified it, as it was the firſt Port in <hi>Scotland</hi> they could ſafely land their Supplies at, for the Queen-mother; but they were obliged to quit that, and the Kingdom, ſome time after, by a Treaty, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſupporting the Reformers againſt her.</p>
            <p>From this Bridge we enter upon a moſt deſolate, and, in Winter, frightful Moor for Travellers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Strangers, called <hi>Coldingham Moor,</hi> upon which, for about Eight Miles, you hardly ſee a Hedge or a Tree, and you meet with but one Houſe all the Way, and that not a Houſe of Entertainment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coldingham,</hi> whence this Moor derives its Name, was an old Monaſtery, built by <hi>Edgar,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the Year 1100, and famous for its Lady Abbeſs <hi>Ebba,</hi> of whom they tell us the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Story.</p>
            <p>This Lady was the Daughter of <hi>Edelfred,</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland</hi>; and, when her Father was taken Priſoner by the Pagan <hi>Mercians,</hi> ſhe got into a Boat in the <hi>Humber,</hi> with three other Women, and, by their own Prayers only, were miraculouſly preſerved, and carried as far as <hi>Scotland,</hi> where, under a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, they were driven on Shore by a Storm, and their Boat daſhed in Pieces.</p>
            <p>When they got aſhore, they laboured with their Hands, and made themſelves a little Hut to lodge in; they continued their religious way of Living, and the Country People ſuſtained them with Food; till at
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0141100404:47"/>
length, acquiring a great Character by their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and Auſterity, they were addreſſed to far and near for their Prayers; and, by the Charity of the People, got enough to build a religious Houſe at <hi>Coldingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, as Fame ſays, when the cruel <hi>Danes</hi> came on Shore, the religious Lady (who, it ſeems, was very beautiful too!) cut off her Noſe and upper Lip, and made all her Nuns do the ſame, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Chaſtity. Whereupon the barbarous <hi>Danes,</hi> enraged at their Zeal, fired their Nunnery, and burnt them all alive. From this Lady, who, it is ſaid, was ſainted for theſe Sufferings, the Promontory where ſhe landed is to this Day called <hi>St. Ebbe's Head,</hi> and vulgarly, by our Sailors, <hi>St. Tabbe's.</hi> There was once, upon the Point of this Promontory, a ſtrong Fort called <hi>Faſt-caſtle,</hi> belonging to the Earl of <hi>Hume</hi>; but it has been ſome time demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>A little to the North-weſt is the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Duns,</hi> remarkable for the Birth of <hi>John Duns Scotus, Anno</hi> 1274. ſome of whoſe Family are ſtill in Being there. He was a Frier Minor, and the greateſt Scholar of his Age. <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſays, there was nothing his Genius was not capable of. But his chief Study was in Points more nice than neceſſary, whereupon he was called <hi>Doctor Subtilis.</hi> His Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, called <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> were great Oppoſers of the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> another Set of Scholaſticks, ſo named from <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> He ſtudied at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> and died of an Apoplexy at <hi>Cologn.</hi> After <hi>Berwick</hi> was taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Sheriff-Court was kept here, which was but lately removed to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-town, called <hi>Greenlow</hi>; which is alſo a Royal Burgh, and the principal in the Shire, belonging to the Earl of <hi>Marchmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Duns</hi> was alſo remarkable for the Encampment of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army, under General <hi>Leſley,</hi> aſſembled to oppoſe King <hi>Charles</hi> I. when he came to the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0141100404:48"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> Borders with an Army, to <hi>perſuade</hi> that Kingdom to Obedience. It has the beſt weekly Market for Cattle in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is a Place of the beſt Trade in this County.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coldſtream</hi> is alſo a Market-town, in this County of <hi>Merſe,</hi> where was antiently an Abbey. <hi>Eccles</hi> likewiſe had another: and <hi>Erſilton</hi> is noted for the Birth-place of the Rhyming Poet <hi>Lermouth,</hi> ſo much admired by the Vulgar <hi>Scots. Hume</hi> was formerly the Reſidence of the Earls of that Name, which they derived from the Town, and they had a ſtrong Caſtle there, now demoliſh'd.</p>
            <p>The inconſiderate Vanity of the ancient <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Gentry and Nobility, of deriving their Names from the Places of their Reſidence, had this Inconvenience attending it, that in a few Generations, it loſt the old Name of the Family from which theſe <hi>Changelings</hi> (may I, without Affront, call them?) deſcended. Thus the <hi>Dunbars</hi> and <hi>Humes,</hi> originally the ſame, came to be thought two diſtinct ones. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the <hi>Gordons, Swintons, Ridpaths, Niſbets,</hi> and the <hi>Spotſwoods,</hi> as ſome ſay, tho' all of the ſame Original, muſt have loſt the Knowledge of it, had it not been for Tradition, or the Armorial Bearings of the ſeveral Families, which beſpeak them to be of the ſame Lineage. This Hint may ſerve once for all, as to thoſe Families called of <hi>that Ilk</hi>; <hi>i. e.</hi> whoſe Surname and paternal Eſtate, are the ſame, and are generally eſteemed ancient and honourable.</p>
            <p>The County of <hi>Merſe,</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> formerly gave Title of Earls of <hi>March,</hi> to the Family of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> who, according to <hi>Camden,</hi> derived their Origin from the famous <hi>Goſpatrick,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who retired into <hi>Scotland</hi> on the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, and was honoured with the Earldom of <hi>March,</hi> and Caſtle of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> by the then King <hi>Malcolm Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> whence his Poſterity took the Name; while another Branch, being poſſeſſed of the Barony of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0141100404:49"/>
               <hi>Hume,</hi> aſſumed that for their Surname, which they ſtill retain. <hi>George de Dunbar</hi> being proſcribed in the Reign of <hi>James</hi> I. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Title of Earl of <hi>March</hi> was conferred on the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> then on the Family of <hi>Stewart</hi> and <hi>Lenox</hi>; which being extinct, King <hi>William</hi> III. conferred it on <hi>William Douglas,</hi> Brother of the Duke of <hi>Queenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> whoſe Son now enjoys it.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed over <hi>Coldingham Moor,</hi> called alſo <hi>Lambermoor,</hi> the Lowlands of <hi>Eaſt-Lothian</hi> ſhew themſelves from the Top of a ſteep Hill, and give a Proſpect of a fruitful and pleaſant Country. As ſoon as we come down the Hill, there is a Village, called <hi>Cockburnſpath,</hi> or <hi>Cobberſpath,</hi> where Nature forms a very ſteep and difficult Paſs, and where a thouſand Men well armed, and boldly doing their Duty, could keep out a very great Army, if there was occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>The next Shire is that of <hi>Eaſt-Lothian</hi>; and the firſt Houſe of any Note we met with in it, was that of <hi>Dunglaſs,</hi> the Seat of Sir <hi>James Hall.</hi> We began here to ſee, that <hi>Scotland</hi> was not naturally ſo barren, as ſome People repreſent it; but might be made equal even to the richeſt, moſt fruitful, moſt pleaſant, and beſt improved Part of <hi>England,</hi> if the <hi>Scots</hi> had the ſame Methods of doing it, and were as good Huſbandmen, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and this might eaſily be brought to paſs, would the Gentry ſet about it, as this Gentleman has, in part, already done.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, the Soil hereabout is very good, and the Sea-ware, as they call the Weeds which the Sea caſts up, abundantly ſupplies the Defect of Marl, Chalk, or Lime-ſtone; for by laying this continually on the Land, they plough every Year, without letting it lie fallow, as we do; and I found they had as much Corn, as our Ploughmen expreſs it, as could ſtand upon the Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0141100404:50"/>The next Town of Note is <hi>Dunbar,</hi> a Royal Burgh, which, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is much the ſame with what we call a Corporation in <hi>England,</hi> and ſends Members to Parliament in like manner; only, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> theſe Burghs have ſome particular Privileges ſeparate to themſelves; as that, for Example, of holding a Sort of Parliament, called a <hi>Convention of Burghs,</hi> a Method taken from the Union of the <hi>Hans Towns</hi> in the North, in which they meet and concert Meaſures for the publick Good of the Towns, and of their Trade, and make By-laws, or Acts and Declarations, which bind the whole Body. Not have they loſt this Privilege by the Union with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but it is preſerved entire, and is now many ways more advantageous to them than it was before, as their Trade is like to be, in time, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. But this I have taken notice of in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Place.</p>
            <p>This Town of <hi>Dunbar</hi> is a handſome well-built Town, ſituated in the Mouth of the River <hi>Forth,</hi> on the South-ſide towards the <hi>German</hi> Ocean. It is a very conſiderable Port, and of great Advantage to all Ships in the River, in caſe of Streſs of Weather; but yet its Entrance was ſo difficult by ſteep Rocks, in the Mouth of the Harbour, that the Corporation had exhauſted itſelf by endeavouring to cut through them; and being unable to proceed further in it; and at the ſame time, the Town-houſe and School of the Town being run to Decay, and the Town itſelf deſtitute of freſh Water: To anſwer all theſe good Purpoſes, they procured an Act to paſs, in the Year 1718. intituled, <hi>An Act for laying a Duty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0141100404:51"/>This Duty has been of very great Service to the Town, and has enabled them to make a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the intended Improvements; but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Works, which were to dig up Part of a Rock at the Bottom of the Harbour, to carry out the great Pier to the Rock called <hi>The Beacon Rock,</hi> to cut the Slope of the Iſland down to a Perpendicular, and to ſupply the Town with freſh Water, remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; and the Act expiring in the Year 1738. the ſame was continued for 25 Years longer, by an Act paſſed 10 <hi>Geo.</hi> II. which will, it is hoped, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all that remains undone.</p>
            <p>They had here a great Herring-fiſhery, which has decayed very much of late Years; and they cure Herrings here, as they do at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> tho' I can't ſay they cure them ſo well, nor are they ſo fit for keeping and ſending on long Voyages. The Herrings themſelves may indeed make a little Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, being generally larger and fatter than thoſe of <hi>Yarmouth</hi>; which makes it more difficult to cure them, ſo as to keep in a hot Climate, and on a long Voyage. Here was formerly a ſtrong Caſtle, which was demoliſh'd by Act of Parliament during the Minority of King <hi>James</hi> VI.</p>
            <p>Between the Town and the great Road ſtands a little, but pleaſant and agreeable Seat of the Duke of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> called <hi>Broxmouth,</hi> with a Park well planted in Viſta's and Walks; for the Gentlemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> are now ſet upon planting Foreſt-trees, as well for Ornament as Profit. And here I would give an uſeful Hint to the Gentlemen who plant Trees in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Want of which, as I have obſerved at ſeveral great Houſes and Parks in that Country, is the Reaſon they do not thrive, as they might otherwiſe do: And this is, by ſecuring the young Trees by a triangular Frame ſeven or eight Feet high, which is made by ſetting three large Stakes about them in an equilateral Triangle, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0141100404:52"/>
Tree and all, with Haybands, to defend the Bark, faſten'd together at the Top. Then, as the Tree ſtands in the Centre of the Triangle, which way ſoever the Wind blows, the Root is not ſhaken, or the Earth moved and looſened about it.</p>
            <p>For want of this, the Tree being left without Support before it has taken Root, the Winds ſhake it every way, and looſen the Earth about it, ſo that it gets no Time to ſtrike. This is the Reaſon why, in many of the Gentlemens Parks, I ſaw the Trees ſtunted and balked, though they had been planted many Years.</p>
            <p>On the South-weſt Side of this Town, under the Mountains, near a Place called <hi>Dun-hill,</hi> is the Field where the Battle of <hi>Dunbar</hi> was fought between <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> and General <hi>Leſly,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, where the deſperate Few (for <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Army was not above 8000 Men) defeated and totally overthrew the great Army of the other Side, killed 6000 of them, and took 10000 Priſoners, to the Surprize of the World.</p>
            <p>Here we turned out of the Way, to ſee the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Tweedale</hi>'s fine Park at <hi>Yeſter,</hi> or <hi>Zeſter</hi>; in the Centre of which ſtands a very noble Houſe, but in a too low Situation.</p>
            <p>The old Earl of <hi>Tweedale,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. having ſeen the Plans of <hi>Greenwich</hi> and <hi>St. James</hi>'s Parks, was ſo pleaſed with them, that, as ſoon as he went down into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he laid out the Plan and Deſign of all thoſe noble Walks and Foreſts of Trees, which he planted here. A Gentleman whoſe Judgment I can depend upon, told me, that if ever thoſe Trees came to be worth but Six-pence apiece, they would be of more Value than the Fee Simple of the whole paternal Eſtate of the Family. Nor is this unlikely, if it be true, that his Lordſhip, and his immediate Succeſſor, planted above 6000 Acres of Land with Fir-trees; and where-ever any
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0141100404:53"/>
of them failed, they were conſtantly renewed the next Year.</p>
            <p>The Park itſelf is ſaid to be eight Miles round, and exceeds, in many reſpects, the new Park at <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in <hi>Surrey:</hi> But the Plantation of Fir is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to this Eſtate; for the Family has another Seat at <hi>Pinkey</hi> near <hi>Muſſelburgh,</hi> where the ſame Lord planted alſo a great Number of Trees, as his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have likewiſe done at another Seat, which they have in <hi>Fife,</hi> near <hi>Aberdour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this Planting is a great Encouragement to the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> to improve their Eſtates by the ſame Method, ſo we find abundance of Gentlemen follow the Example; inſomuch that you hardly ſee a Houſe of Note, eſpecially in the South Parts of this Country, but is adorned with Groves and Walks of Fir-trees about it; by which we may reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that in a little time <hi>Scotland</hi> will have no need to ſend to <hi>Norway</hi> for Timber and Deal, but will have ſufficient of her own, and, perhaps, be able to furniſh <hi>England</hi> too with conſiderable Quantities.</p>
            <p>From this Town of <hi>Dunbar</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Country may be reckoned as fruitful, pleaſant, and rich, as any in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or, indeed, as moſt in <hi>England.</hi> The Sea is on the Right-hand at a moderate Diſtance, and the Hills on the Left, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, which are habitable, and feed large Flocks of Sheep, and have many open Roads leading over them from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and other Parts, towards <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt material Thing this Country wants, is more incloſed Paſtures, by which the Farmers would be enabled to keep a ſufficient Stock of Cattle well foddered in the Winter, and thereby not only be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Store of Butter, Cheeſe, and Beef for the Market, but likewiſe by the Dung of the Beaſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nrich their Soil, according to the unanſwerable
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0141100404:54"/>
Maxim in graſing, That Stock upon Land improves Land.</p>
            <p>Two other Articles would increaſe and enrich them, which they ſeldom or never practiſe:
<list>
                  <item>1. Folding their Sheep within moveable Hurdles.</item>
                  <item>2. Fallowing their ploughed Land.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt would fatten the Ground, and the latter deſtroy the Weeds; which would be of great Service to the Land at a Diſtance from the Sea, where they have not the Benefit of Sea-weed, which I have juſt now mentioned.</p>
            <p>But at preſent, for want of Incloſures, they have no Winter Proviſion for black Cattle, and therefore the Farmers have no Dairies, no Butter or Cheeſe, in any Quantity, and no Heaps of Dung in their Yards to return upon the Land for its Improvement. Thus a good Soil is impoveriſhed for want of Huſbandry.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Dunbar</hi> we paſs another River <hi>Tyne,</hi> which, to diſtinguiſh it from the two <hi>Tynes</hi> in <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I ſhall call <hi>Scots Tyne,</hi> tho' not ſo diſtinguiſhed here. It riſes in the Hills near <hi>Yeſter,</hi> and watering part of the fine and pleaſant Vale I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, runs by <hi>Haddingtoun,</hi> a Royal Burgh, and an old, half-ruined Town, with the Remains of an old Nunnery. It was formerly large, handſome, and well-built, and reckoned very ſtrong; for beſides the Walls of Stone, which were in thoſe Times eſteemed very good, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fortified it with Lines and Baſtions, four of which latter were very large, as may be ſeen by what remains of them to this Day. It had alſo a large Ditch, and was ſo ſtrong, that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> commanded by Sir <hi>George Wilford,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it againſt a great Army of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> tho' his Gariſon were almoſt all ſwept away by the Plague, till he was relieved from <hi>England,</hi> when he quitted it, after demoliſhing the Fortifications.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0141100404:55"/>They have a good Stone-bridge here over the <hi>Tyne,</hi> tho' the River is but ſmall. The Church was large, but has ſuffered in the Ruin of the reſt, and but part of it is repaired, tho' big enough for the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Inhabitants. There are in it ſome Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remaining of the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and other <hi>Maitlands,</hi> ancient Lords of this Part of the Country; but as the Choir of the Church is open and defaced, they have ſuffered with the reſt.</p>
            <p>In and about this Place I ſaw ſomething of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, and a Face of Induſtry, which was the firſt I had hitherto ſeen the leaſt Appearance of in <hi>Scotland</hi>; particularly, here was a Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, erected by a Company or Corporation for making Broad-cloth, which they call <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth: And as they had <hi>Engliſh</hi> Workmen, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool, they really made it very good; but I cannot ſay they could bring it ſo cheap to the Market as they do in <hi>England.</hi> This was the Reaſon, that tho' before the late Union, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited upon ſevere Penalties, their own Cloth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them very well; yet, as ſoon as the Union was made, by which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade was opened, the Clothiers from <hi>Worceſter, Glouceſter, Wilts, Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> brought in their Goods, and underſelling the <hi>Scots,</hi> thoſe Manufacturies were not able to ſtand it. However, the People turn their Hands to other Things, are ſtill employed in Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Dying, Weaving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and carry on a good deal of that Sort of Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>On the North-ſide of the Mouth of the <hi>Forth,</hi> ſtand the Remains of <hi>Tantallon</hi> Caſtle, infamous in the <hi>Scots</hi> Hiſtory for being the Seat of Rebellion in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> V. Hence came the odd Fancy among the Soldiers, That the Drums beating the <hi>Scots</hi> March, which was invented by the King's Soldiers, when they marched againſt the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> who held out this Caſtle againſt him, ſay,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0141100404:56"/>
               <hi>Ding down Tantallon.</hi> But it is now no more a Fortreſs, being intirely demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>Over-againſt this, in the Mouth of the ſame River, ſtands a ſteep Rock, called the <hi>Baſs,</hi> inacceſſible on all Sides, except by one narrow Paſſage. It was formerly ſlightly fortified, rather to prevent its being made a Retreat for Pirates and Thieves, than for any Uſe it could be of to command the Sea; for the Entrance of the <hi>Forth</hi> is ſo wide, that Ships can go in and out, without the leaſt Danger of being hurt by any thing that could be offered from the <hi>Baſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Times of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and his Brother King <hi>James</hi> VII. it was made a State-Priſon, where the Weſtern People, called in thoſe Days <hi>Cameronians,</hi> were confined, for being in Arms againſt the King. And after the Revolution a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Crew of People got Poſſeſſion of it; and having a large Boat, which they hoiſted up upon the Rock, or let down at Pleaſure, committed ſeveral Piracies, took a great many Veſſels, and held out the laſt of any Place in <hi>Great Britain</hi> for King <hi>James:</hi> But their Boat being at laſt either ſeized or loſt, and not being ſeaſonably ſupplied with Proviſions from <hi>France,</hi> as they uſed to be, they were obliged to ſurrender.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Solan</hi> Geeſe are the principal Inhabitants of this Iſland, a Fowl rare as to its Kind; for they are not found any-where in <hi>Britain</hi> that I can learn, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept here, in ſome of the leſſer Iſlands in the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and in the Iſland of <hi>Ailzye,</hi> in the Mouth of the <hi>Clyde.</hi> They come as certainly at their Seaſon, as the Swallows or Wood-cocks, with this Difference, (if what the People there tell us may be depended on) that they generally come exactly to the very ſame Day of the Month.</p>
            <p>They feed moſtly on Herrings, and therefore 'tis obſerved, they come juſt before or with them, and go away with them likewiſe, tho', 'tis evident, they do not follow them; for they go all away to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0141100404:57"/>
North, but whither, is not known. As they live on Fiſh, ſo they eat like Fiſh, which, together with their being ſo exceeding fat, makes them, in my Opinion, a very coarſe Diſh, rank, ill-reliſhed, and ſoon gorges the Stomach. But here they are look'd upon as a Dainty.</p>
            <p>It is a large Fowl, rather bigger than an ordinary Gooſe. 'Tis web-footed, but its Bill is pointed like a Crane or Heron, only much thicker, and not above five Inches long. When they are coming, they ſend ſome before to fix their Manſion, which, for that Reaſon, are called <hi>Scouts.</hi> The Inhabitants are careful not to diſturb them till they have built their Neſts, and then they are not to be frightened by any Noiſe whatſoever. They lay but one Egg at a time, which they ſo dextrouſly fix by one End to a Point of the Rock in the middle of the Neſt, that if it be pulled off, 'tis difficult to fix it ſo any more. They hatch it, by holding it faſt under one Foot, and ſeldom leave it till it be hatched. The Fiſh caught by the old ones often ſerve the Inhabitants for Food, and the Sticks they bring to make their Neſts ſupply them with Fewel. They make great Profit both of the Fleſh and Feathers of their young ones, which are taken from their Neſts by one let down the Rock with a Rope. When young, they are of an aſh Colour; but when old, white.</p>
            <p>At the Top of the Rock is a freſh-water Spring, with a ſmall Warren for Rabbets; but the Bottom of it is almoſt worn through by the Tide. It was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Poſſeſſion, and ſometimes the Seat, of the antient Family of <hi>Lawder,</hi> who a long time refuſed to ſell it, tho' often ſolicited to it by ſeveral Kings. King <hi>James</hi> VI. told the then Laird, <hi>He would give him whatever he pleaſed to aſk for it</hi>; whereby that Gentleman had a fine Opportunity of making a good Bargain: But after he had told his Majeſty, That he would ſell it upon theſe Terms, and the King deſiring
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0141100404:58"/>
to know what he would aſk, he anſwered, <hi>Your Majeſty muſt e'en reſign it to me; for I'll have the ald Craig</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Rock) <hi>back again.</hi> However, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, at laſt, coming to Decay, it was purchaſed by King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
            <p>From hence, keeping the Shore of the <hi>Forth,</hi> due Weſt, we find a Range of large and populous Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages all along the Coaſt, almoſt as far as <hi>Leith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Part of the Country is delightfully ſpread with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen; as the Duke of <hi>Roxburgh</hi>'s near <hi>Dunbar,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi>'s at <hi>Tinningham,</hi> the Lord <hi>Beilhaven</hi>'s at <hi>Beilhaven,</hi> and that of the Family of <hi>Dalrymple,</hi> Earl of <hi>Stair,</hi> who have fine Seats at the Burgh of <hi>North Berwick,</hi> (where there is a ſmall, but pretty good Market) <hi>Hales,</hi> and in the Neighbourhood of this Place.</p>
            <p>The Houſe and Eſtate of <hi>Dirleton,</hi> now in the Family of <hi>Niſbet,</hi> is pleaſantly ſeated in this Part of the Country; as is <hi>Ormiſtoun,</hi> a thriving little Town, belonging to the Family of <hi>Cockburn</hi>; round which they have a handſome Eſtate, ſo well planted and improved, that I don't remember to have ever ſeen a more beautiful Spot of Ground. They have alſo a pretty good Seat here; but when I ſaw it, it was very much out of Repair.</p>
            <p>I muſt here add, the antient and noble Houſes of <hi>Seton</hi> and <hi>Winton,</hi> both Palaces (for ſo they deſerve to be called) of the late Earl of <hi>Winton,</hi> who did ſo many weak and raſh Things in the Affair of the late Rebellion. They are now in a State of Ruin, as is the Eſtate on which they ſtand, which, for its Value, is as fine as any in <hi>Scotland,</hi> lying all conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous with itſelf, and valued at almoſt 5000<hi>l. Sterling per Annum</hi>; but all being under Forfeiture, it was ſold to the <hi>York-Buildings</hi> Company. The fine Gates, and Stone Wall, were demoliſhed by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after it had been made a Gariſon by the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0141100404:59"/>
Highlanders, who from hence began their hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd March to <hi>England,</hi> which Expedition ended at <hi>Preſton.</hi> The Name <hi>Seton</hi> was given the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from the Term <hi>Set-on,</hi> which one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors of it uſed to the Soldiers he commanded, when entering upon an Engagement. They were reckoned a very gallant, as well as loyal Family; and no true <hi>Scotſman</hi> can well omit telling the memorable Story, That in the Year 1332. when <hi>Edward</hi> II. came before <hi>Berwick,</hi> where Sir <hi>Alexander Seton</hi> was then Governor, he ſummoned him to ſurrender, and threatened to hang his two Sons, whom he had among his Hoſtages, if he delayed. Accordingly a Gallows was erected near the Town Wall, and the young Men led forth. Tenderneſs for his Children began to move the Governor, when his Lady (of the Name of <hi>Cheyne</hi>) came and told him, <hi>He and ſhe were both young enough to have more Children; but if he ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he could never recover his Honour.</hi> Upon this, he refuſed, and the Tyrant cruelly murdered the young Gentlemen; but the Lady was rewarded with Two Sons afterwards.</p>
            <p>The Towns upon this Coaſt, as I ſaid, ſtand very thick; and there are two or three Articles of Trade which render them more populous, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, than they would otherwiſe be.<list>
                  <item>1. There are great Quantities of white Fiſh taken and cured all along this Coaſt; and I obſerved, that they were very well cured, merchantable, and fit for Exportation.</item>
                  <item>2. There is great Plenty of Coal in the Hills, ſo near the Sea, that the Carriage is eaſy, a great deal of which is carried to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and other Towns thereabouts.</item>
                  <item>3. They make very good Salt at almoſt all the Towns upon the Shore; as at <hi>Seton, Cockenny, Preſtonpans,</hi> and ſeveral other Places. They have a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0141100404:60"/>
very great Trade for this Salt to <hi>Norway, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Bremen,</hi> the <hi>Baltick,</hi> and even <hi>Holland</hi>; and the Number of Ships loaded with it here yearly is very conſiderable.</item>
                  <item>4. They take great Quantities of Oyſters here alſo, with which they not only ſupply the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but carry abundance of them in large open Boats, called <hi>Cobles,</hi> as far as <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tyne</hi>; from whence they generally bring back Glaſs Bottles.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>At ſeveral of theſe Villages are little Moles and Harbours, or Peers, built up at a conſiderable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for ſecuring the Ships that come to load Salt, and other Goods; as at <hi>North Berwick, Aberlady, Preſton, Preſtonpans,</hi> which is alſo noted for good Malt Liquor, <hi>Cockenny, Port-ſeton,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Country hereabouts is both pleaſant and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, and full of Gentlemens Houſes; among which is <hi>Salton,</hi> belonging to Mr. <hi>Fletcher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We came next to <hi>Muſſelburgh,</hi> an antient <hi>Burgh of Regality.</hi> In this Town are many Hands em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Woollen Manufacture, eſpecially in coarſe Stuffs for the Uſe of the Poor; and they have continued many Years ſucceſsfully this Branch of Trade without any Rival.</p>
            <p>A little Weſt from this lies <hi>Fiſher-raw,</hi> ſo called from a very large Row of Houſes moſtly inhabited by Fiſhermen, who were formerly more numerous here than at preſent; for the Muſcle Trade, which was of old reckoned very valuable, is now given over; and their chief Buſineſs, at preſent, conſiſts in catching Cods, Haddocks, Whitings, and ſome few Shell-fiſh.</p>
            <p>More to the South are two ſmall Villages, called <hi>New-bigging</hi> and <hi>Good-ſpeed-all</hi>; but they are ſo nearly joined to <hi>Muſſelburgh</hi> and <hi>Fiſher-raw,</hi> that a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0141100404:61"/>
Stranger would take them to be all one continued Town. Nevertheleſs, they have not had a Church ſince the Reformation, but are only a Part of the Pariſh of <hi>Invereſk,</hi> an adjoining Village, ſo called, becauſe it ſtands on the River <hi>Eſk,</hi> which, tho' it be ſometimes ſo full of Water as to overflow its Banks, yet, being rapid, it is not made navigable.</p>
            <p>This Village enjoys ſo good an Air, that the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dr. <hi>Pitcairn</hi> called it the <hi>Montpelier</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It is very full of People, and there are ſeveral very handſome Houſes and Gardens in it, which invite the Citizens of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to take Lodgings here in the Summer, as the <hi>Londoners</hi> do at <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington-gravel-pits, Hampſtead, Hackney,</hi> and <hi>High-gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Glory and Beauty of this Pariſh is <hi>Pinkey,</hi> which formerly belonged to <hi>Seton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Dumferm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> but now to the Marquis of <hi>Tweedale,</hi> who uſually reſided here before his Houſe at <hi>Yeſter</hi> was finiſhed; which, tho' it be the moſt magnificent Building, yet is not ſo agreeably ſituated as <hi>Pinkey,</hi> which ſtands near the Sea, juſt as we enter into <hi>Muſſelburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Court before the Houſe is a large Stone Well, covered with an Imperial Crown of Stone, ſupported by Pillars of the <hi>Ionick Order.</hi> The great Hall on the Right, as you enter, is adorned with Views of the great Cities of <hi>Italy</hi>; and in a Drawing-room adjoining to it, is a Billiard-table. The great Stair-caſe on the Left is baluſtraded with Iron, and crowded with Pictures.</p>
            <p>The firſt Apartment conſiſts of a Dining-room, Drawing-room, and Bed-chamber, all very ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, curiouſly wainſcotted with Oak, and hung with the Seaſons in Tapeſtry, of the ſmall Figures, and beſt Sort. The Bed is of crimſon Velvet in an Alcove, neatly ſupported with Pillars. The Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys are of Marble, and above that of the Dining-room
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0141100404:62"/>
is painted the fineſt Inſide of a Church that is any-where to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>The great Gallery is very long and ſpacious, the Ceiling whereof is full of <hi>Latin</hi> Inſcriptions ſuitable to the ſeveral Paintings. Here is a Family Picture of the Lord <hi>Seton,</hi> with his Four Sons and Daughters, by <hi>Hans Holbein</hi>; Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> the Covenanter, by <hi>Vandyke</hi>; the whole Length of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and his Chancellor, the Earl of <hi>Dumfermline,</hi> in his Robes, by the ſame Hand. The firſt Earl of <hi>Twee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> with his Eight Sons and Seven Daughters, all in one Picture, as big as the Life, takes up almoſt one End of the Room. There are fine Altar-pieces, Paſſion-pieces, and others of that Kind, that were ſaved from Plunder out of Monaſteries at the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Here is likewiſe a good Picture of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and another of the Duke of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale,</hi> (who married his only Child to the Heir of this Family) with great Numbers of Family Pictures of the <hi>Hays</hi> and <hi>Setons.</hi> There is alſo well preſerved the genealogical Tree of the Family, from the Year 970. to this Time; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Hays, Giffards,</hi> and <hi>Frazers.</hi> But many of the Pictures have been of late carried to <hi>Yeſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parterre behind the Houſe is very large, and nobly adorned with Ever-greens, and on each Side of it ſpacious Gardens. The Whole ſtands in a Park above three Miles in Circumference, well planted with an incredible Number of Fir-trees, and walled round with Stone. I confeſs, if I had been Owner of <hi>Pinkey,</hi> I ſhould hardly have built <hi>Yeſter</hi>; for <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> ſtands nobly, and has a commanding Proſpect, not only over the adjacent Country, but alſo of the Coaſt of <hi>Fife,</hi> over the Sea, at nine Miles Diſtance: Whereas <hi>Yeſter,</hi> as I have ſaid, lies in a Bottom, and all its Views bounded within itſelf. <hi>Yeſter,</hi> 'tis true, is the antient Seat of the Family, whoſe Title to <hi>Pinkey</hi> is but late, and (ſome ſay) was precarious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0141100404:63"/>Near this Place was fought a Battle by <hi>Edward Seymour,</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> when he came to force the <hi>Scots</hi> into the Marriage of their young Queen <hi>Mary</hi> with his Nephew King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. which was, by-the-by, a very coarſe way of Wooing. Here was a great Slaughter of the <hi>Scots:</hi> But tho' the <hi>Engliſh</hi> won the Battle, yet they loſt their Prize; for the young Queen was privately embarked, carried to <hi>France,</hi> and afterwards married to the Dauphin, who became King <hi>Francis</hi> II.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> call this the Battle of <hi>Muſſelburgh</hi>; but ſome <hi>Scots</hi> Gentlemen, riding out with us, to ſhew us the Place where the Action was begun and ended, we all agreed, that the <hi>Scots</hi> are in the right, who call it the Battle of <hi>Pinkey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now approached the capital City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; but muſt ſay a Word or two of its Situation, before I enter it. Standing then at a ſmall Diſtance, and taking a View of it from the Eaſt, you have really but a very confuſed Idea of the City, becauſe the Situation being in Length from Eaſt to Weſt, and the Breadth ill-proportioned to it, you view it under the greateſt Diſadvantage poſſible; whereas, if you turn a little to the Right-hand towards <hi>Leith,</hi> you have a very handſome Proſpect of it; and from the South you ſee it to yet more Advantage, becauſe it is increaſed on that Side with new Streets.</p>
            <p>At the Extremity of the Eaſt-end of the City ſtands the Palace of <hi>Holy-rood-houſe</hi>; leaving which, a little to the Left, you come thro' a populous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urb to the Entrance, called the <hi>Water-port.</hi> From hence, turning Weſt, the Street goes on in a ſtrait Line, thro' the whole City to the Caſtle. It is above a Mile in Length, and is, perhaps, the largeſt, longeſt, and fineſt Street, for Buildings, and Number of Inhabitants, in the World.</p>
            <p>From the Palace Door, which ſtands on a Level with the loweſt of the plain Country, the Street
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0141100404:64"/>
begins to aſcend very gradually, being no-where ſteep; but this Aſcent being continued for ſo long a Way, it is eaſy to underſtand, that the further Part muſt neceſſarily be very high; for the Caſtle, which ſtands, as it were, at the Extremity Weſt, as the Palace does Eaſt, makes, on all the three Sides, (that only excepted, which joins it to the City) a frightful and impaſſable Precipice.</p>
            <p>Together with this continued Aſcent, you are to ſuppoſe the Edge or Top of the Aſcent ſo narrow, that the Street, and the Row of Houſes on each Side, take up the whole Breadth; ſo that which way ſoever you turn, you go down Hill imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; which is ſo ſteep, that it is very troubleſome to thoſe who have not very good Lungs, to walk in thoſe Side-lanes, which they call <hi>Wynds.</hi> By this Deſcription you will perceive, that the City ſtands upon the narrow Ridge of a long aſcending Mountain.</p>
            <p>On the North-ſide of the City, towards the Weſt-end of it, where the Caſtle ſtands, is a Lough, or Lake of Water; which has a ſmall Brook that runs thro' it, ſo that it cannot be ſaid to be quite ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There was formerly another Lake on the South-ſide of it, which, being now filled up, is built into a Street, tho' ſo much lower than the high Street, that, as I ſaid before, the Lanes between them are very ſteep.</p>
            <p>The Town is ſo antient, that no Hiſtory has recorded when, by whom, or on what Occaſion, it was built; yet, it ſeems moſt natural to conclude, that ſuch a Situation could not be choſen, but for a Retreat from the Outrages and Attempts of the <hi>Britons, Saxons, Danes,</hi> or other Enemies; for having an impregnable Caſtle at the Weſt-end, and a Lake on either Side, the Inhabitants had nothing to defend but the Entrance at the Eaſt-end, which it was eaſy to fortify.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0141100404:65"/>If this was not the Reaſon for chuſing the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what ſhould have hindered them from building the City in a pleaſant, delightful Valley, with the Sea flowing up to one Side, and a River running thro' the Middle of it? ſuch as that Space of Ground between it and the Sea, where the Town of <hi>Leith</hi> ſtands. There they would have had a noble, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and moſt uſeful Situation, a very fine Harbour for their Trade, a good Road in the <hi>Firth</hi> for their Ships of Burden; a pleaſant River, which, with ſmall Art and Charge, might have been ſo drawn round the City as to have filled its Ditches, and made its Fortifications almoſt impregnable, as the <hi>French</hi> did, when they fortified <hi>Leith.</hi> Or had they gone to the South-ſide of the City, and extended it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Libertoun</hi> and <hi>Goodtrees,</hi> they had found a Plain large enough to have contained another <hi>London,</hi> watered on the South-part with a pleaſant Brook, capable, by the Help of Pipes, to have conveyed Water into every Street and Houſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things they did not foreſee, or not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in thoſe Days; but, regarding immediate Safety, fixed on the Hill, as a ſure Strength, formed by Nature, ready at their Hand. By this means, the City lies under ſuch Inconveniencies as are made a Subject of Scorn and Reproach by ſome, as if the People delighted in Stench and Naſtineſs; whereas, were any other People to live under the ſame Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a rocky and mountainous Situation, a Throng of Buildings from ſix to ten Stories high, a Difficulty of obtaining Water, (that little they have being to be carried up to the uppermoſt Apartments) we ſhould find a <hi>London</hi> or a <hi>Briſtol</hi> as dirty as <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and, perhaps, leſs able to make their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tolerable, at leaſt in ſo narrow a Compaſs; for tho' many Cities have more People in them, yet, I believe, there is none in the World, where ſo many People live in ſo little Room.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0141100404:66"/>On the North-ſide of the City, as I have ſaid, is a ſpacious, rich, and pleaſant Plain, extending from the Lake, which joins it, to the River of <hi>Leith,</hi> at the Mouth of which is the Town of <hi>Leith,</hi> at the Diſtance of a long <hi>Scots</hi> Mile. Here, were not the North-ſide of the Hill which the City ſtands on, ſo exceeding ſteep, that it is not only impaſſable for Carriages, but can hardly be clambered up on Foot, and were the Lake filled up, as that on the other Side is, the City might have been extended upon the Plain below, and fine Streets would, no doubt, have been built: Nay, I queſtion much, whether, in time, the high Streets would not have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, and the City, as I may ſay, run all out of its Gates to the North.</p>
            <p>This might have been the Conſequence, if the City had been in a State of Increaſe; for had their Trade flouriſhed, as was reaſonably expected, if the Buſineſs of <hi>Darien</hi> had ſucceeded, or upon the Union, the Inhabitants would have likewiſe increaſed.</p>
            <p>Having thus conſidered the City in its outward Appearance, and in its Situation, I muſt look next into its Inſide, where we ſhall find it (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all its Diſcouragements and Diſadvantages) a large, populous, noble, rich, and even Royal City. The main Street, as above, is the moſt ſpacious and beſt inhabited in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Buildings are ſurpriſing for their Strength, their Beauty, and their Height, and are moſtly of Free-ſtone; yet ſo firm, that tho' they ſtand ſo high, and in a Country where Storms and violent Winds are ſo frequent, 'tis very rare, and only on ſuch Occaſions as I ſhall mention by-and-by, that any Damage is done here.</p>
            <p>From the Palace-gate Weſtward, this Street is called the <hi>Canongate,</hi> as belonging to the Canons of the Abbey, which is a kind of Suburb by itſelf, as <hi>Southwark</hi> is to <hi>London.</hi> In this Part of the Street, tho' otherwiſe not ſo well inhabited as the City itſelf,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0141100404:67"/>
are ſeveral very magnificent Houſes of the Nobility, built for their Reſidence when the Court was here. Of theſe the Duke of <hi>Queenſbury</hi>'s, the Earl of <hi>Winton</hi>'s, the Duke of <hi>Roxburgh</hi>'s, the Earl of <hi>Panmure</hi>'s, and the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi>'s, are the chief: The firſt and laſt are very large and princely Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, all of Free-ſtone, large in Front, and have good Gardens behind them.</p>
            <p>At the Upper or Weſt-end of this Street, where it joins to the City, is a Gate, which, like <hi>Ludgate,</hi> parts the City from the Suburb, but does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the Street, which rather widens, and is more ſpacious, when you are thro' the Gate, than before. This is the famous <hi>Nether-bow Port,</hi> whoſe Doors were like to have been taken away by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, when the Affair of Captain <hi>Porteous</hi> was under their Conſideration, as I ſhall mention more particularly by-and-by.</p>
            <p>Juſt at this Gate, on the Outſide, are two Streets, one of which is called <hi>St. Mary Wynd,</hi> and the other <hi>Leith Wynd</hi>; the firſt leads out of the City, South, into the great Road for <hi>England,</hi> by the Way of <hi>Kelſo</hi>; and at the Foot of it is a Gate turning Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the low Street, called the <hi>Cowgate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cattle are driven thro' it to and from the great Market-place: The other leads North into a Suburb, called the <hi>Calton,</hi> from whence there is a very handſome Gravel-walk, 20 Feet broad, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the Town of <hi>Leith,</hi> which is kept in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair at the publick Charge, and no Horſes ſuffered to come upon it.</p>
            <p>We now enter the City at the <hi>Nether-bow Port,</hi> and have an open View up the high Street. It muſt not be expected I ſhould deſcribe all the Buildings of the City; I ſhall therefore touch upon ſome few, and go on. The firſt of any Note is a fine Houſe on the South-ſide of the Street, a little within the Gate, belonging to the Marquis of <hi>Tweedale,</hi> with a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0141100404:68"/>
Plantation of Lime-trees behind it, the Place not allowing Room for a large Garden: Adjoining to this are very good Buildings, which, if ſet out in handſome Streets, would adorn a very noble City; but being crouded together in narrow Wynds and Alleys, deſerve no Notice.</p>
            <p>A little further, on the ſame Side, is the <hi>Trone</hi> Kirk; and near it, in the Middle of the Street, ſtands the Guard-houſe, where two Companies of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined Men, cloathed and armed like Grenadiers at the Charge of the Town, do Duty every Night, and keep the publick Peace of the City.</p>
            <p>About Mid-way between the <hi>Nether-bow</hi> and the Caſtle, is the great Church, which, before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, was Collegiate, and dedicated to <hi>St. Gyles</hi>; but it was afterwards divided into ſeveral Preaching-places, and Diſtricts of the City were allotted to them, ſo as to be parochial. When King <hi>Charles</hi> I. erected a new Biſhoprick at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time was in the Dioceſe of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> it was made a Cathedral, and the Dean was Forenoon Miniſter of that Part of it, called the <hi>New Kirk,</hi> which is the Choir, Chancel, or Eaſtern Part. In it is a noble Gallery for the King, or his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner. Here alſo the Magiſtrates aſſemble, and the Judges in their Habits, in time of Seſſion. In a large Chapel, on the South-weſt Part of this Church, the General Aſſembly hold their Seſſions, as does alſo the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly, in the Interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the General Meetings.</p>
            <p>The great Croſs under the Tower is called the <hi>Old Kirk</hi>; and the Front or Weſt-part of the great Church is divided into two Parts: That on the South is called the <hi>Tolbooth Kirk,</hi> and that on the North <hi>Haddo's Hole,</hi> from the Laird of <hi>Haddo,</hi> (Grandfather to the preſent Earl of <hi>Aberdeen</hi>) who being a great Royaliſt and Anti-covenanter, was kept Priſoner in a Vault there, till he was beheaded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0141100404:69"/>The Steeple in the Middle is very high, and of good Architecture; the Summit of it reſembles an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown. Here they have a Set of Bells, which are not rung out as in <hi>England,</hi> (for that way of Ringing is not known in this Country) but are played upon by the Hand with Keys, like a Harpſichord, the Perſon playing having great Leather Covers to his Fiſts, by which he is able to ſtrike with the more Force. They play all manner of Tunes very muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and the Town gives a Man a yearly Salary for playing upon them from half an Hour after Eleven, till half an Hour after Twelve, every Day, <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holidays</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>On the South-ſide of this Church (formerly the Church-yard) is a Square of very fine Buildings, called the <hi>Parliament Cloſe,</hi> the Weſt and South-ſides of which are moſtly taken up with the Parliament-houſe, the ſeveral Courts of Juſtice, the Council-chamber, the Exchequer, the publick Regiſters, the Court for the Royal Boroughs to aſſemble in, the Lawyers Library, the Poſt Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The great Church makes up the North-ſide of the Square, and the Eaſt and Part of the South-ſide is built into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Dwellings very ſtately, lofty, and ſtrong, being ſeven Stories high to the Front of the Square, and the Hill they ſtand on having a very ſteep Deſcent, ſome of them are no leſs than fourteen Stories high backwards. In the middle of this Square is an Eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian Statue of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. which is reckoned the fineſt of its kind in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament-houſe is a ſtately, convenient, and large Structure. Over its Entrance are the Arms of <hi>Scotland</hi> well cut, with <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> on each Side, for Supporters; and this Inſcription, <hi>Stant his felicia regna</hi>; importing, that theſe Virtues make Kingdoms happy. And under the Arms was this Motto, <hi>Unio Unionum</hi>; relating not only to the Union of the two Crowns, but ſignifying, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0141100404:70"/>
their Advice was neceſſary for the Maintenance of it. The Room for meeting of the Parliament had, on that Occaſion, a high Throne for the Sovereign, or the Commiſſioner, with Benches on each Side for the Nobility and Biſhops, and Forms conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently placed in the Middle, for the Commoners. Without the Area was a Pulpit for Sermons to the Parliament, on particular Occaſions; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Pulpit a large Partition for others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Members, to hear the Sermons, and Debates of the Houſe, when they thought fit to allow it. This Building, in ſome meaſure, reſembles <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and tho' not quite ſo large, has a much more curious Roof. In the South or Upper-end, one of the ordinary Judges ſits every Week in Seſſion-time, to hear Cauſes in the firſt Inſtance: But when the Parliament ſat, that Court was removed to another Part of the Hall. At the Weſt-end of it are kept the Sheriff and Commiſſary Courts. Near the North-end is the Town Council-houſe or <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and over it is the Juſtciary or Criminal Court. At the South-eaſt Part of the Parliament-houſe, is a Door from what they call the <hi>Outer-houſe</hi> (where the Lord Ordinary ſits) into the <hi>Inner,</hi> where ſit the other Fourteen Judges, or Lords of Seſſion; which is the ſupreme Civil Judicature of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Over which are Apartments for the Lords of Exchequer, and for the Privy-council when in Being.</p>
            <p>In the Lower-part under the Parliament-houſe, is a noble Library of Books and MSS. belonging to the College of Juſtice, or Gentlemen of the Law.</p>
            <p>Near the Council-chamber ſtands the Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, made up of a double Row of Shops, and another Exchange inferior to this.</p>
            <p>The great Opening into the high Street, being the only Paſſage into it for Coaches, is at the North-eaſt Corner, a little from which is the Market-croſs, where all their Proclamations and publick Acts are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0141100404:71"/>
read and publiſhed by Heralds and Sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. Here is the great Parade, where Gentlemen meet for Buſineſs or News, as at the Exchange, every Day from Eleven to One.</p>
            <p>Near the Weſt-end of the great Church ſtands the <hi>Tolbooth,</hi> or common Priſon, as well for Criminals as for Debtors. It was formerly the Place of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the Provoſt of <hi>St. Gyles's,</hi> as moſt of the adjacent Houſes were for the Canons and Choiriſters of that Church.</p>
            <p>The great Church and this Priſon both ſtanding in the middle of the Street, the Breadth and Beauty of it is for ſome Space interrupted; but thoſe Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings paſt, the Street opens again to its former Breadth, and is now called the <hi>Lawn-market,</hi> from the <hi>Linen-market</hi> being kept here. This Part of the Street extends Weſt to a narrower one, which leads to the <hi>Caſtle-hill.</hi> At the Upper-end of it is a Stone Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appropriated to ſeveral publick Offices of leſſer Value, called the <hi>Weigh-houſe</hi>; for below Stairs are Ware-houſes, with publick Weights and Scales for weighing heavy Goods.</p>
            <p>Here the high Street parts into two, one of which leads to the Caſtle Hill, as already noticed, and the other turns South-weſt, and deſcending gradually, leads to the <hi>Graſs-market,</hi> a Place very like <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in every reſpect, where is kept a weekly Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for Black Cattle, Sheep, Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Street, which is called the <hi>Weſt-bow,</hi> is inhabited moſtly by wholeſale Dealers in Iron, Pitch, Tar, Oil, Hemp, Flax, Linſeed, Drugs, Woads, and ſuch-like heavy Goods.</p>
            <p>This City hath ſeven Gates, or Ports, as they are here called, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Nether-bow Port:</hi> This is the chief Gate; it was magnificently built in 1606. and adorn'd with Towers on both Sides. This is the Entrance from the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0141100404:72"/>
Palace, and the principal Suburb called the <hi>Canon-gate.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Cow-gate Port,</hi> at the Eaſt-end, likewiſe gives Entrance to the Street of that Name, leading to the Abbey by a Backway.</item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>Potter-row Port,</hi> gives Entrance to the Suburb ſo called, and leads to <hi>Dalkeith, Kelſo,</hi> &amp;c. Southward.</item>
                  <item>4. The <hi>Society Port,</hi> called ſo from the Society of Brewers, who have a great ſquare Court near it, with ſtately Houſes and Buildings round it.</item>
                  <item>5. The <hi>Weſt Port,</hi> the only Gate at the Weſt-end of the City, which leads thro' a large Suburb to <hi>Glaſgow, Sterling, Queens-ferry,</hi> and from thence to the Weſt and North Highlands.</item>
                  <item>6. The <hi>New Port,</hi> at the Eaſt-end of the Lake, leading Northward towards a Village called <hi>Mouter's Hill</hi> and <hi>Leith.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. The <hi>College-Kirk Port,</hi> leading alſo to <hi>Leith.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Markets here are very well ſupplied with all the Neceſſaries of Life, and are moſtly kept in diſtinct Market-places walled in, and reſerved for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Things they are appointed for; ſuch as
<list>
                  <item>1. The Meal Market.</item>
                  <item>2. The Fleſh Market.</item>
                  <item>3. The Poultry Market.</item>

                  <item>5. The Corn Market.</item>
                  <item>6. The Leather Market.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there is a Weekly Market for all Sorts of Woollen Manufactures, and Linen Cloth, kept in that Part of the high Street called the <hi>Lawn Market,</hi> juſt now mentioned. There is alſo in the ſame Street, below the Croſs, an Herb and Fruit Market kept every Morning, but abates before Noon, ſo that it is no Incumbrance. The Market for Black Cattle, Sheep, Horſes, and Graſs, is kept in that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0141100404:73"/>
large Space of Ground within the <hi>Weſt Port,</hi> called the <hi>Graſs Market,</hi> as I have already mentioned.</p>
            <p>On the South-ſide of the City, towards the Eaſt-end, ſtands a large Building, erected at the Charge of the Surgeons and Apothecaries of this City, in which is their great Hall, hung round with the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of all the Surgeons of this Place that have been ſince this Building was founded. Here they have alſo a Theatre for Diſſections, and a Chamber of Rarities, in which there are ſeveral Skeletons of uncommon Creatures, a Mummy, and other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities.</p>
            <p>Near the <hi>Potter-row Port</hi> ſtands the College, or Univerſity. It conſiſts of three Courts, two lower, and one higher, equal to the other two. Theſe Courts are encompaſſed with neat Buildings for the Uſe of ſuch Students as pleaſe to lodge in them; for they don't live in common, nor are they obliged to reſide, but only to attend their Claſſes at certain Hours. There is a high Tower over the great Gate, looking to the City.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Publick Schools</hi> are large and commodious; there are Accommodations for Students, handſome Dwellings for the Profeſſors, and fine Gardens for their Recreation. It was founded in 1580. by King <hi>James</hi> VI. upon a Petition from the City, to grant them a Charter with the Privilege of an Univerſity; but the Foundation was not perfected till 1582. The Perſons eſtabliſhed by the Foundation were, a Principal or Primate, a Profeſſor of Divinity, four Regents or Maſters of Philoſophy, and a Profeſſor of Philology called <hi>Prof. Humaniorum Literarum,</hi> or Regent of Humanity. In 1640. the Town added a Profeſſor of Mathematicks. To which have been lately added Profeſſors of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Civil Law, Theoretical and Practical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, Chymiſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Dignity of Chancellor
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0141100404:74"/>

            <p>They have a very good Library, which was founded by <hi>Clement Little,</hi> one of the Commiſſaries of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; ſince which it is much increaſed by Donations from the Citizens, Perſons of Quality, and others, who had their Education there. The Library is neatly kept, well furniſhed with Books, put in very good Order, cloiſter'd with Wire Doors, which none but the Keeper can open, which is more commodious, and leſs encumbering, than Multitudes of Chains, commonly uſed in other Libraries. The Books given by the grand Benefactors, are kept in diſtinct Apartments, and the Donor's Name over them in Letters of Gold.</p>
            <p>Over the Books hang the Pictures of ſeveral Princes, and of the moſt eminent Reformers at Home and Abroad; and near them is kept the Skull of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Buchanan,</hi> very intire, and ſo thin, that the Light may be ſeen thro' it. It was depoſited there by Mr. <hi>Adamſon,</hi> formerly Principal of the Univerſity, who procured it to be taken out of his Grave, and faſtened ſome <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes to it in Commendation of that celebrated Hiſtorian. There is alſo the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Proteſt againſt the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> for burning <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague, Anno</hi> 1417. with 105 Seals of <hi>Bohemian</hi> and <hi>Moravian</hi> Grandees annexed to it. It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by a <hi>Scots</hi> Gentleman in his Travels, and given to the Univerſity.</p>
            <p>Under the Library was the King's Printing-houſe, for Bibles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At the farther End of the Library is a Stair-caſe, which leads to the higher and lower Common Halls, where they hold their Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and College Entertainmenrs. In this Place are ſeveral Maps, Globes, Books, and Rarities; and among others a crooked Horn, cut out of a Woman's Head when fifty Years old, and who lived twelve

Years after it. It is ſeveral Inches long, and was taken out of her Head by a Surgeon, <hi>Anno</hi> 1671. Here alſo are Lectures read, Exerciſes performed, and Apartments for the Profeſſor of Divinity to teach his Pupils in, and for a ſelect Library proper for Divines.</p>
            <p>In this higher Common Hall, which is a very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Room, are placed ſuch Books as have been bought by, or given to the College, ſince the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary below was full; and in the South-end of it is a curious and noble Muſeum, collected by the very eminent Sir <hi>Andrew Balfour,</hi> who was once Tutor to the famous Earl of <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> It contains a vaſt Treaſure of Curioſities of Art and Nature, domeſtick and foreign, from almoſt all Parts of the World, and is greatly valued by the Virtuoſo's, containing ſome Rarities that are not to be found, either in thoſe of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> or the <hi>Aſhmolean</hi> at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Sibbald,</hi> having a mind to engraft his Name and Merit, on that of the celebrated <hi>Balfour,</hi> made a Preſent of a great Number of Shells, and other Curioſities, to the College, on Condition the Magiſtrates would print the Account of it, called, <hi>Auctarium Muſei Balfouriani e Muſeo Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldiano</hi>; to which I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>Eaſtward from the College is the High-School, well endow'd, and with proper Apartments for one Maſter and four Uſhers, who teach Youth Grammar and Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Gray's-cloſe,</hi> near the <hi>Cowgate Port,</hi> is the Mint-houſe, in a large Court, with neat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Buildings, and other Accommodations for the Maſter, Officers, and Workmen. It is now diſuſed for that Purpoſe; and is a Sanctuary, or Place of Privilege.</p>
            <p>At a ſmall Diſtance from the College are two neat Hoſpitals, with pretty Gardens to each of them; and a little further is the Church-yard of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> or <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

whole City within the Walls, where are a great many fine and curious Monuments. It contains about two Acres of Ground.</p>
            <p>Adjoining to it is <hi>Heriot's Hoſpital,</hi> a large and ſtately Building, the moſt magnificent of its Kind in the World, adorned with a conſecrated Chapel, large Walks, delightful Greens, and pleaſant Gardens. It was built by the Rev. Dr. <hi>Balcanqual,</hi> to whom <hi>George Heriot,</hi> Jeweller to King <hi>James</hi> VI. left near 17000 Pounds, to be diſpoſed of in pious Uſes, which that worthy Dean did by building and endowing this Houſe, and giving Statutes to it, which he ordered ſhould be <hi>unalterable.</hi> 'Tis a Nurſery for an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Number of the Sons of Freemen, who are maintained, cloathed, and educated in uſeful Learning, till they are fit for Apprenticeſhips, or to go to the Univerſity, where they are allowed handſome Salaries and Exhibitions.</p>
            <p>On the South-ſide of the City, in the way to <hi>Leith,</hi> is a beautiful Collegiate Church, built by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Guelders,</hi> Queen to King <hi>James</hi> II. and dedicated to the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> but now Parochial, tho' nothing but the Church Part was ever finiſhed.</p>
            <p>Near it is <hi>St. Thomas's Hoſpital</hi>; wherein old decayed Citizens, and their Widows, are very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently provided for, and allowed a Chaplain.</p>
            <p>Over-againſt it is <hi>Bridewell,</hi> or the Houſe of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in which diſſolute People undergo Diſcipline, and are kept to hard Labour. There is an Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it for lunatick and diſtracted Perſons.</p>
            <p>Of late Years, Mrs. <hi>Hare</hi> left a noble Benefaction for a new Hoſpital for Female Orphans of decay'd Freemen; which created a laudable Emulation in many others, whoſe united Contributions have raiſed another, for the ſame good Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>An Infirmary, called the <hi>Royal Infirmary,</hi> after the Example of thoſe at <hi>London, Wincheſter,</hi> &amp;c. has been lately erected at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by the liberal
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0141100404:77"/>
Contribution of many well-diſpoſed Perſons; and there was ſo general a Good-will to the Work, that the like Spirit has hardly ever been known any-where. The Proprietors of ſeveral Stone-Quarries made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of Stone to it, others of Lime. Merchants contributed Timber. The Wrights and Maſons were not wanting in their Contributions: The neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Farmers agreed to carry Materials <hi>gratis:</hi> The Journeymen Maſons contributed their Labour for a certain Quantity of hewn Stones; and as this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking is for the Relief of the diſeaſed, lame, and maimed Poor, even the Day-labourers would not be exempted, but conditioned to work a Day in a Month <hi>gratis</hi> to the Erection. The Ladies too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed in their own way to it; for they appointed an Aſſembly for the Benefit of the Work; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well-attended, every one contributed bountifully to it. It has met with no ſmall Encouragement from the Nobility and Gentry; and his Majeſty was pleaſed to give 100<hi>l.</hi> towards it: So that it is really a noble Work, and is now in a flouriſhing Condition. The following is the Inſcription on the firſt Stone:

When the Learned in Phyſick and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery have pronounced their Diſeaſes <hi>deſperate</hi> and <hi>irremediable,</hi> and when upon that Account they have been <hi>ſet out</hi> of the <hi>Infirmary,</hi> or <hi>refuſed Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into it,</hi> as being without Compaſs of the Power of Medicine, or Skill of the Phyſician to recover them, many of them have no Houſes of their own, where they may languiſh out the tedious Remains of a comfortleſs Life; ſo that if they do not ſoon die in the <hi>Streets</hi> or <hi>Fields,</hi> they muſt wander to Places where they can have neither <hi>Miniſters</hi> nor <hi>Phyſicians</hi> to bring them that Aſſiſtance, and thoſe <hi>Softenings,</hi> which may make unavoidable Death more eaſy and happy to them.</p>

               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0141100404:79"/>The Phyſicians were incorporated in 1682. by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and have their College near the <hi>Nether-bow</hi> in the <hi>Fountain-cloſe.</hi> They are deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly eſteemed learned and able, and give not place to the Phyſicians of any Country.

            <p>On the North-ſide of the City is an excellent Phyſick-garden, containing ſome thouſands of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Plants and Simples.

            <p>The City is govern'd by a Lord-Provoſt, whoſe Office is much the ſame as that of the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi>; four Bailiffs, who, beſides the Power of Aldermen in the Government of this City, have that of Sheriffs, and a common Council, ordinarily conſiſting of twenty-five Perſons, but extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of thirty-eight. All theſe are choſen annually; and the Provoſt, Dean of Guild, and Treaſurer, are to be Merchants; or if any Tradeſman be choſen, he muſt quit his Trade, and not return to it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Leave of the Magiſtrates and Town-Council; and he muſt alſo be a Year or two a Member of the common Council. No one is to continue in the Council above two Years at a time, except he be a Member of it by virtue of a ſuperior Office. The Bailiffs are to be choſen indifferently out of twelve Candidates propoſed, and none is to be elected Deacon of any of the fourteen incorporated Trades, except he has been Maſter of his Trade two Years at leaſt; and

            <p>None of the Merchants or Traders are to have any particular Conventions, or make any By-laws among themſelves without Conſent of the Magiſtrates and Town-Council, except to chuſe their own Deacons at the appointed Time, to make Perſons free of their Trade, or to try their Work; and one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Parliament was always to be choſen out of the Tradeſmen, and another out of the Merchants. The Auditors of Accounts are to be choſen out of an equal Number of both. The Lord-Provoſt, Dean of Guild, and Treaſurer, are not to continue longer than two Years at a time; and the Bailiff muſt be one Year a Bailiff, one Year old Bailiff, and one Year free of Office.

            <p>And here it will be proper to take notice of the notorious Riot committed in this City on the 7th of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1736. in relation to Capt. <hi>Porteous,</hi> which made ſo much Noiſe, and brought down upon this famous City the Reſentment of the Legiſlature of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſe was this: One <hi>Andrew Wilſon</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a Robbery of the publick Money, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the Highway; and on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the 14th of <hi>April</hi> 1736. the Day appointed for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, the Magiſtrates, being apprehenſive that a Reſcue would be attempted, ordered Capt. <hi>John Porteous,</hi> at the Head of a Detachment of the City Guard, to attend the Execution; and Powder and Ball were delivered to them for that Purpoſe. That while <hi>Wilſon</hi> was hanging, the Populace, inſiſting he ſhould be cut down before the uſual Time, and being refuſed, attempted to do it by Force, and meeting Oppoſition from the Captain and his Guard, they outrageouſly pelted them with Stones, and hurt ſeveral of the Detachment. That hereupon the Captain order'd them, as he was accus'd, but which he deny'd, to fire; and upon the Mob continuing their Inſults, and the Captain's Men firing over their Heads to intimidate them, the Captain order'd them to level their Pieces, and fired himſelf, both which however he deny'd; and by that means ſix Perſons were mortally wounded, and fourteen others very deſperately maimed and hurt. That hereupon the Captain was brought to his Tryal, and on a very ſolemn Hearing, was found guilty of firing a Gun himſelf, and ordering his Men to fire; and ſo was condemn'd to be hang'd upon a Gibbet, on the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0141100404:82"/>
8th of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1736. The Captain drew up a Petition to her late Majeſty, then Regent of the Kingdom, in the Abſence of the King; and inſiſted on his Innocency, praying for Mercy; and great Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation having been made to her Majeſty for changing the Sentence to Tranſportation, a Reprieve for ſix Weeks, was granted. Which arriving, on the 2d of <hi>September,</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> occaſion'd the moſt extraordinary Riot that ever was known or heard of, all Circumſtances conſidered, except that at <hi>York</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> mentioned in its Place.</p>
            <p>For, on the 7th of <hi>September,</hi> the Night before the Captain was to be executed, had he not been reprieved, about ten at Night, ſome Men by Surprize enter'd the City, ſeized all the Fire-arms, Battle-axes, and Drums belonging to the City Guard.</p>
            <p>The Mob hereupon, in a few Minutes, lock'd and ſecur'd all the City Gates, and with Drums beating an Alarm, attempted with Hammers, and other Inſtruments, to force open the [<hi>Tolbooth</hi>] Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-door: But failing, they deſperately ſet Fire to it, and burnt it. When they entered the Priſon, they made the Under-keeper open the double Locks of the Apartment where the Captain was. He begg'd in vain to be ſpared till the Afternoon; and making ſome Reſiſtance, they dragg'd him down Stairs by his Legs, and hurried him away. This was about eleven at Night, and they march'd out with Lights before them. In their Way to the <hi>Graſs-market,</hi> paſſing by a Barber's Sign-poſt, ſome called out to hang him up there; but it was reſolved to hang him where the Murders, for which he was condemn'd, were committed. So they proceeded to the Place where, on Executions, the Gallows uſed to be fixed; where they kept him above a Quarter of an Hour, till they open'd a Shop, and brought out a Rope, one End of which they threw over a Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt about 20 Feet high. He deſir'd ſome Time to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0141100404:83"/>
prepare for Death; but was anſwer'd, They would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him no more than thoſe had who were ſhot. They then pull'd him up in the Dreſs in which they found him; <hi>viz.</hi> a Night-gown and Cap: His Hands not being ty'd, he fix'd them betwixt his Neck and the Rope, whereupon one with a Battle-ax ſtruck at his Hands. They then let him down, and he having on two Shirts, they wrapt one of them about his Face, and ty'd his Arms with his Night-gown, and then pull'd him up again, where he hung next Morning till Day-light; when he was cut down, and carried to the <hi>Grey-fryars</hi> Church. Upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his Body, it appear'd his Left-ſhoulder was wounded, his Back diſcolour'd, and his Neck broke. He deny'd his giving Orders to fire, with his laſt Breath.</p>
            <p>It was obſerv'd, that this Mob was under a ſtricter Concert, and better Conduct, than uſual; for, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along to the Execution, the unhappy Man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, he gave him a Purſe of twenty-three Guineas, which he deſir'd might be deliver'd to his Brother; which they offer'd not to obſtruct. They left indeed the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors open, whereby ſeveral Priſoners eſcaped; but after they had perpetrated the unprecedented Fact, they left the Arms and Drums at the Place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, where they were found next Morning. Moreover, during the Tumult, Parties of armed Men, with Drums, patrolled in the different Streets, to prevent any Surprize from the King's Forces quarter'd in the Suburbs. The Magiſtrates, attended with ſeveral of the Burgeſſes, attempted, as was ſaid, to diſperſe the Mob; but were pelted with Stones, and threaten'd with Fire-arms, if they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. After the Execution was over, they went to the Lord-Provoſt's Houſe, and telling him they were ſatisfy'd, departed, without offering any other Violence. Nay, it was ſaid, that to do the Act
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0141100404:84"/>
with more Decency, having no Clergyman, they order'd two of the graveſt among them to exhort the unhappy Man, as they carry'd him to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>The Boldneſs, Secrecy, and Conduct of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, was the moſt extraordinary Inſtance of its kind that ever was known; and the Keeper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that tho' the Perſons who firſt enter'd, and demanded the Keys, wore Leather Aprons, but were otherwiſe well dreſs'd, it made ſome imagine, that Perſons above the vulgar Rank had a hand in it.</p>
            <p>Be this as it would, the Inſult on the Sovereign Authority was too flagrant to be overlook'd. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, with Rewards of 200<hi>l.</hi> Sterling, were iſſued for apprehending the Rioters; and when the Parliament met, vigorous Meaſures were taken in the Affair. The Lord-Provoſt was order'd up to <hi>London</hi> in Cuſtody, the Magiſtrates were order'd up alſo, to attend the Houſe of Lords at <hi>London</hi>; and finally, an Act of Parliament was paſſed, to diſable <hi>Alexander Wilſon,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> from holding or enjoying any Office of Magiſtracy in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> or <hi>Great Britain</hi>; a new Provoſt was injoin'd to be choſen, and a Fine of Two thouſand Pounds levied upon the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for the Uſe of the Widow of Captain <hi>Porteous,</hi> as Puniſhments for their reſpective Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſſes in not endeavouring to prevent this Inſult on Sovereignty, and all lawful Authority.</p>
            <p>This Act, however, paſſed not without great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; and as ſome thought it impoſſible to prevent a Deſign ſo well concerted, and ſo ſuddenly and boldly executed, they were of Opinion, that the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was treated with too much Severity. But, after all, it could not be expected, but that the Legiſlature ſhould ſhew the higheſt Indignation againſt ſo inſolent a Riot.</p>
            <p>This Act was paſſed in the 10th Year of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and in the ſame Seſſion was alſo paſſed another,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0141100404:85"/>
for the more effectual bringing to Juſtice any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concern'd in this ſtrange Attempt; in which Fugitives not ſurrendering were made liable to Death: The concealing of thoſe who ſhould be declared Fugitives, was alſo made Death: This Act was to be read before Morning Sermon in every Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> every <hi>Sunday</hi> for a Year: Impeachers were to be encouraged, and diſcharged; Informers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with 200<hi>l.</hi> Sterling for every Perſon they ſhould convict, and be admitted Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>But ſo ſecretly was this dark Affair managed, that I don't remember any body has ſuffer'd on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and the reading of the Act was but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently digeſted by many in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Greater Severity was intended; ſuch as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning, as well as diſqualifying the Lord-Provoſt for a Year; for aboliſhing the Town-Guard of the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and for taking away the Gates of the <hi>Nether-bow</hi> Port, and keeping open the ſame. But the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was happily ſaved from this Diſgrace.</p>
            <p>It is now Time to return to our Subject.</p>
            <p>The Churches in this populous City and Suburbs are Twelve, including the Chapel of the Caſtle: The Miniſters about Twenty; beſides Three Chapels.</p>
            <p>The Twelve Churches are:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Canon-gate Kirk.</item>
                  <item>2. The Collegiate, or College Kirk.</item>
                  <item>3. The Trone Kirk, or Chriſt's Kirk.</item>
                  <item>All theſe are Parts of the Cathedral of <hi>St. Gyles</hi>'s.<list>

            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0141100404:86"/>There are alſo about twenty Meeting-houſes of the Epiſcopal Party; for tho' Preſbytery be the eſtabliſhed Religion of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſince the Revolution, yet a great Number of the People of all Ranks are not of that Opinion, eſpecially in the Nothern Parts.</p>
            <p>The Churches are always very full; for the People in this Country do not wander about on the Sabbath-days, as in <hi>England.</hi> They have alſo one very good Cuſtom as to their Behaviour in Church, which I wiſh was practiſed in <hi>England:</hi> If any Perſon comes in after Divine Service is begun, he takes no Notice of any body, nor any body of him; whereas we make our Bows and Cringes, even in the Middle of our Prayers. Not that the <hi>Scots</hi> want Manners; for they ſhew them more properly after the Sermon is done, and the Bleſſing given, when they all look round upon their Friends, eſpecially to Perſons of Diſtinction, and make their Civilities as courteouſly as we do.</p>
            <p>The City is encompaſſed with a kind of <hi>Roman</hi> Wall on every Side, except the North, where it is ſecur'd by a Lake.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle only, and the Palace, remain to be mentioned. The firſt is ſtrong both by Situation and Art, but far from being impregnable, as has been experienced more than once. It was formerly called the <hi>Maiden</hi> Caſtle, becauſe the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kings kept their Daughters in it. Still more antiently, it was called <hi>Alatum Caſtrum,</hi> or the <hi>Winged Caſtle,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from its Form, and ſtanding on ſo high a Hill, as it were in the Air: It is ſituated at the Weſt-end of the City, as we have ſaid, where the Rock riſes to a high and large Summit. 'Tis inacceſſible on the South, Weſt, and North. The Entrance is from the Town, where the Rock is alſo very high, and is defended by a round Battery, and an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work at the Foot of it. In the Caſtle is a Royal Palace of hewn Stone, where are kept the Regalia,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0141100404:87"/>
and chief Records of State, as alſo the Magazine for the Arms and Ammunition of the Nation.</p>
            <p>A Chapel is alſo in it for the Uſe of the Gariſon; and it is furniſhed with Water by two Wells in the Rock. From the Caſtle is a delightful Proſpect over the City and neighbouring Country, and to the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> from whence it is ſaluted by ſuch Men of War as come to anchor in <hi>Leith</hi> Road. The Governor is always a Perſon of prime Quality, and General of the Forces.</p>
            <p>The Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Fort-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, and ſome other Officers, have very good Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and there are deep Vaults in the Rock, which, they ſay, are Bomb-proof.</p>
            <p>The Palace, called <hi>Holy-rood-houſe,</hi> is a very handſome Building, rather convenient than large. The Entrance is majeſtick, and over the Gate is a large Apartment, which the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> claims as Hereditary Keeper of the Palace. Within this is a large, irregular Court, where are Coach-houſes and Stables, which, I think, are very improperly placed here; for if they had ſtood farther off, either in the Park, or without the Out-gate, and a Barrack, or Guard-houſe, like the Horſe-Guards at <hi>White-hall,</hi> built in their Stead, it would have been much more becoming a Royal Palace.</p>
            <p>This may be called the <hi>Eſcurial</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being both a Royal Palace, and an Abbey, founded by King <hi>David</hi> I. for Canons Regular of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who named it <hi>Holy-rood-houſe.</hi> The Entrance from the great outer Court, already deſcribed, is adorned with Pillars of hewn Stone, under a Cupola in the Form of an Imperial Crown, baluſtraded on each Side a-top. The Fore-part has two Wings, on each of which are two Turrets; that towards the North was built by King <hi>James</hi> V. whoſe Name it bears in Letters of Gold, and that towards the South (as well as all the reſt) by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. whereof Sir
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0141100404:88"/>
               <hi>William Bruce</hi> was Architect. The inner Court is very ſtately, all of Free-ſtone well hewed, with Piazzas round it, from which there are Entries into the ſeveral Apartments, truly royal and magnificent; but above all, the Long Gallery is very remarkable, being adorned with the Pictures of all the <hi>Scots</hi> Kings from <hi>Fergus</hi> I. to <hi>James</hi> VII. incluſive, by maſterly Hands. Thoſe Kings that were eminent, and all the Race of <hi>Stuarts,</hi> are in full Length; the others are but Buſto's.</p>
            <p>You turn to the Right to the Royal Apartments, as at <hi>St. James</hi>'s; and the Stair-caſe and Guard-room run exactly as there, but far more lofty and magnificent. Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Apartment (as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Keeper) is in the double Tower to the North, and the great Council Chamber in the Tower to the South. The Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> when Chancellor, in the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, converted this noble Room into a Popiſh Chapel, and his Apartment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it was the Jeſuits School, which being demoliſhed by the Mob at the Revolution, has been neglected ever ſince. The Chimney-pieces are all of Marble, and the Apartments two Pair of Stairs for the Officers of State are very well kept, being lent to many of the Nobility, who now live in them.</p>
            <p>Behind this Palace, the Conventual Church makes a Wing to the North, and Eaſtward from it is <hi>St. Anne's-yard,</hi> which was deſigned to be branched out into Gravel-walks, adorned with Statues; but the Revolution coming on, attended with a long and expenſive War, and afterwards the Union with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> prevented its being put in Execution.</p>
            <p>The Church is very high to the Roof, and the Pillars are as exquiſite as thoſe of <hi>St. George</hi>'s Chapel at <hi>Windſor.</hi> It is an antient, very reverend, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Fabrick, and uſed only as a Burial-place for Perſons of Quality. In it King <hi>James</hi> VI. was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0141100404:89"/>
crowned by Biſhop <hi>Hepburn,</hi> aſſiſted by <hi>John Knox,</hi> as was King <hi>Charles</hi> I. by Archbiſhop <hi>Spotſwood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> VII. began to erect a magnificent Throne here for the Sovereign, and twelve Stalls for the twelve Knights Companions of the moſt noble and antient Order of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> or <hi>the Thiſtle,</hi> which he had revived after a long Diſuſe: The fineſt Carvers and other Maſters in <hi>Europe</hi> were employed in it. But at the Revolution the Rabble demoliſhed all, and ranſacking every Corner, fell upon a Vault quite built up, ſo as not to be known what it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was, in which were found the Bodies of King <hi>James</hi> V. and <hi>Magdalene</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> his firſt Queen, together with Lord <hi>Darnley</hi>'s, all embalmed and preſerved in Pickle; whereby the Malice of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> and others, to blacken Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Memory, was diſcovered; for ſhe gave him a Royal Funeral ſuitable to his high Dignity, and did not carry him by Porters privately to a common Burial-place, as that Author had aſſerted.</p>
            <p>The adjoining Park is about four Miles in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; but, which is very odd, there is neither Deer nor Tree in it, and, tho' it be very mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, affords good Paſture for Cattle. There is a very high and craggy Rock in it, near half a Mile to the Top, called <hi>Arthur</hi>'s <hi>Seat,</hi> from <hi>Arthur,</hi> the <hi>Britiſh</hi> King, who, they ſay, uſed to view the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Country from thence.</p>
            <p>This Palace, or Abbey, and Park, is Sanctuary for Debtors; and no one, but by the King's Order only, can arreſt any Man, who has entered his Name in an Office kept there for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to obſerve, that according to ſeveral Acts of Parliament, divers great publick Works have been undertaken, and moſtly brought to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for the Benefit of the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and Town of <hi>Leith,</hi> and their Vicinities, within theſe few Years paſt, by Benefit partly of the eaſy <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0141100404:90"/>
Tax of Two-pence <hi>Scots</hi> on every <hi>Scots</hi> Pint of Ale and Beer ſold in the ſaid City: And partly of the Diſcontinuance of what they called the <hi>Petty-port-Cuſtoms</hi> there; ſome of which Works are as follow:</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates have, at a great Expence, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Springs, and renew'd the Pipes which convey Water to the Town; rebuilt the Fountains in the High-ſtreet; inlarged the Harbour of <hi>Leith,</hi> and deepened its Chanel; have built ſeveral hundred Feet of Key there in a very ſufficient manner; have built two new Churches; have paved, at a great Expence, with Cauſey-ſtone, the whole High-ſtreets and Ways leading to their City; have made a good Highway from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to <hi>Leith</hi>; have built a large Workhouſe for the Poor, to be employed in Manufacture, and endow'd the ſame with 300<hi>l. per Annum.</hi> Alſo have ſettled Salaries on the Law Profeſſor at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and Stipends on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the two new Churches; have rebuilt the City Walls; and taken Meaſures for paying their old Debts, as well as thoſe incurred on account of the Rebellion in 1715.</p>
            <p>They further propoſed alſo, by means of this Fund, to narrow the noxious Lake on the North-ſide of the City, commonly called the <hi>North Loch,</hi> into a Canal of running Water; to erect a Street of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Fields, on the North-ſide of the City; to build a proper Hall for the Court of Juſticiary, and an Edifice for the publick Records; to eſtabliſh a Salary to a Profeſſor of Civil Hiſtory, and <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities; another to a Profeſſor of <hi>Scots</hi> Law, and other publick-ſpirited Purpoſes. And all this is provided for and eſtabliſhed by an Act, which paſſed 9 <hi>George</hi> I. <hi>Anno</hi> 1722. confirming and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Act of Parliament 1693. and an Act of 3 <hi>George</hi> I. to which Act of 9 <hi>George</hi> I. we refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0141100404:91"/>I ſhall juſt ſtop to mention an odd Circumſtance that was of fatal Conſequence to the poor Dogs about <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> in the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1738. A mad Bull-bitch having bitten many Dogs in the <hi>Fleſh-market,</hi> to prevent the bad Conſequences that might follow, the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> iſſued a Proclamation, ordering all the Dogs in that Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration to be forthwith put to Death, under Penalty of 5<hi>l.</hi> Sterling, and Impriſonment to the Owners, for twelve Calendar Months; and to prohibit all Perſons from keeping Dogs for thirty Days from that Time: And the Magiſtrates of <hi>Leith</hi> joining in the Order, nothing was to be ſeen for ſeveral Days, but chaſing, hacking, ſlaſhing, hanging, and drowning of Dogs; and great Lamentations were heard from divers, for the Loſs of their favourite Puppies; for with ſuch Zeal was this Order executed, that the Ladies had enough to do to preſerve any of their Lap-dogs; and, as it was, many Gentlemen got rid by it of formidable Rivals.</p>
            <p>I ſhall alſo take notice here of the Miſchiefs done by a terrible Storm, which happen'd <hi>Jan.</hi> 14. 1739. in this City, and the adjacent Parts, of the like of which we have hardly any Example. The Wind began to blow pretty hard between Eleven and Twelve the preceding Night, and before One it roſe to a complete Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, and continued with ſurpriſing Fury till Four in the Morning.</p>
            <p>As the Houſes in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> are built high, they ſuffered conſiderable Damage. The Leads which cover'd the ſtately Building in the <hi>Parliament-Cloſe,</hi> were carried off the Roofs, ſome of them more than forty Feet in Dimenſions. The <hi>Canon-gate</hi> Church ſuffered exceedingly, and the fine Portico there was almoſt demoliſh'd. The Conſternation was heighten'd by the Alarm of the Fire-Drum; for the Brewery at the Eaſt-end of the Meadow, belonging to one Mr. <hi>Bryſon,</hi> taking Fire, the Wind increaſed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0141100404:92"/>
the Flame, inſomuch that the Water-works proved ſo many uſeleſs Machines; ſo that the Brewery and Houſe were conſumed, and ſome low Houſes at a conſiderable Diſtance catching the Flame, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reduced to Aſhes. Nor was the Fire confined to that Quarter; for, near the <hi>Canon-mills,</hi> on the oppoſite Part of the Town, a Farm-houſe, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one Mrs. <hi>Angus,</hi> likewiſe took Fire, which conſum'd it together with the Corn-ſtacks and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes. Theſe Fires happen'd not thro' any Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but were intirely occaſion'd by the Impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Wind, which having got Entrance to the Houſes, ſcatter'd the Fire, and ſet it in a Glow. A large new Houſe at the Back of the <hi>Canon-gate,</hi> conſiſting of five Stories, was intirely beaten down. This was the more remarkable, as it had been twice deſtroy'd before; and the Owner had built it ſo ſtrongly, that ſhe promis'd herſelf Security againſt any Accidents of that kind. The Buildings in the Caſtle were prodigiouſly damaged; their fine Lead Coverings were carried off, and thrown upon the Rocks; the Magazine was almoſt demoliſh'd, and other conſiderable Damages done. The Houſes at the <hi>Multries-hill,</hi> which lay much expoſed, were almoſt all unroofed, and the new Play-houſe was quite uncover'd.</p>
            <p>This violent Tempeſt confined not itſelf to this City: At <hi>Leith</hi> it produced likewiſe very diſmal Effects; ſeveral Houſes were damaged, and the End of one ſtruck down; the Lead-mill was uncover'd; ſeveral of the Ships in the Harbour broke looſe, and with ſuch Violence, that they carried along with them the great Iron Rings to which they were faſten'd.</p>
            <p>The Shire of <hi>Aire</hi> produced no leſs diſmal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; at <hi>Irvine</hi> it blew ſo hard, that many of the Ships ſuffer'd much, and many of the Buildings in the Town were thrown down. At <hi>Aire</hi> the Loſs was much greater; a general Havock was made among
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0141100404:93"/>
the Houſes and Shipping, moſt of which ſuffer'd; and the <hi>Anne</hi> Galley, bound for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> drove on Shore, and was daſh'd to Pieces; but the Crew were happily ſaved.</p>
            <p>The like diſmal Account they gave from the <hi>Merſe,</hi> where the Storm occaſion'd a terrible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, few Houſes being left undeſtroy'd, and ſeveral Churches blown down, and Numbers ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the Ruins, and a general Havock made among the Sheep and Cattle.</p>
            <p>This Storm did very great Damage in other Parts of the Iſland, in <hi>South</hi> as well as <hi>North Britain</hi>; but the Effects of it at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were ſo terribly remarkable, that we thought the above Particulars would not be amiſs to inſert here.</p>
            <p>Now we are on the Subject of melancholy Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, the Reader will excuſe me for the following Account of a very deplorable one, which happen'd at <hi>Kirkaldy, Jan.</hi> 7. 1739-40.</p>
            <p>It is a well-known Cuſtom, that in theſe Parts, the firſt <hi>Monday</hi> of the Year is always obſerved with uncommon Gaiety and Mirth, and in Conſequence becomes a Holy-day to Apprentices and Servants, fourteen of which, belonging to <hi>Path-head,</hi> a little Village adjacent to <hi>Kirkaldy,</hi> having got a little Money, went to divert themſelves with a common Amuſement among Boys, by throwing up <hi>Thiſtles or Crowns:</hi> The Place they choſe was a Cave, or a large Hollow below a rocky Eminence. As they were thus innocently amuſing themſelves, the Rock tumbled down, and cruſh'd them to-pieces. 'Tis ſcarce poſſible to form an Idea of the ghaſtly Sight which their mangled Bodies exhibited. Parents could not diſtinguiſh the Corpſes of their own Children. The Parts of ſome who were cloſe together when the Rock fell, were ſo mingled, that there was no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; and the Carnage was the moſt diſmal that could be imagined. One eſcap'd by his being at a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0141100404:94"/>
greater Diſtance from the Rock; but his Leg was broke in a vaſt Number of Places. This fatal Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe cauſed an extraordinary Grief, eſpecially as ſome Parents loſt two, others all their Children.</p>
            <p>The following odd Accident happen'd at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> in <hi>September</hi> 1740. A Soldier belonging to the Regiment in the <hi>Canon-gate,</hi> went to the King's Park on a Sheep-ſtealing Expedition, where he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily happen'd to engage with a large headſtrong Ram, near one of the Precipices at <hi>Arthur</hi>'s <hi>Seat,</hi> mention'd above, which puſh'd him headlong from the Top of the Rock, ſo that they both fell down together, and had their Necks broken. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Fellow was found next Morning with a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Ram's Wool clench'd in his Fiſt.</p>
            <p>We next viſited <hi>Leith,</hi> the Sea-port of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which is a large and populous Town, or rather two Towns; for the River or Harbour parts them: but they are joined by a ſtately Stone-bridge, to which Ships of Burden may come, and, at High-water, lay their Sides cloſe to the Shore.</p>
            <p>Here is a very fine Quay, well wharfed up with Stone, and fenced with Piles, able to diſcharge much more Buſineſs than the Place can ſupply, tho' the Trade is far from being inconſiderable. At the Mouth of the Harbour is a very long and well-built Pier, or Head, which runs out beyond the Land a great way, and defends the Entrance into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from being filled up with Sand, as it would otherwiſe be, when the Wind blows hard at North-eaſt. There are alſo Ranges of Piles, or Break-waters, as the Seamen call them, on the other Side of the Harbour, all which are kept in good Repair; and by this means the Harbour is preſerved, and kept open, in ſpite of a flat Shore, and a large Swell of the Sea.</p>
            <p>On the other Side of the Bridge are the Remains of a ſtrong Caſtle, built by <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0141100404:95"/>
the Port, which is not yet ſo far demoliſhed, but that a little Expence would ſoon reſtore it. Here the late Rebel Highlanders made a bold Stop, and took Poſſeſſion of it for one Night; but not finding their Friends in the City in any Condition to join them, and the Troops preparing to attack them, they quitted it in the Night, and marched off to the Earl of <hi>Winton</hi>'s Houſe, as I have already related.</p>
            <p>This Town was once very ſtrong; for the <hi>French</hi> held it for ſome Years againſt the Reformers, but were at laſt driven out by an Army which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſent from <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt the Proteſtants. It is under the Juriſdiction of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and is govern'd by a Bailiff under them.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Leith</hi> the Firth is ſeven Miles over, and holds that Breadth for five or ſix Miles; but is narrower a little beyond <hi>Cramond,</hi> and at <hi>Queen's-ferry</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to two Miles in Breadth. This Place is a very good Town as well as Ferry, and a Corporation, or Royal Burgh. Near the Water of <hi>Leith</hi> is a good Copper Mine.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Cramond,</hi> juſt mention'd, and in the Lands of <hi>Ingleſtown,</hi> as well as at other Places in this County, <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities have been found; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, near the former Place were dug up two Stones, late in Sir <hi>Robert Sibbald</hi>'s Yard at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> upon one of which is a Laurel Crown, and on the other a <hi>Roman Securis:</hi> they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been Part of a Pillar erected in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Time, when <hi>Agricola</hi> was in theſe Parts. Near this Place, in the Beginning of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1740. a Whale between 50 and 60 Feet in Length, and 16 in Depth, was caſt on Shore; whoſe Mate afterwards, tumbling about above the Ferry, was heard to make a hideous Moan, as is ſuppoſed, for its Loſs.</p>
            <p>Between <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and this Town the Country is thronged with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0141100404:96"/>
among which the Marquis of <hi>Annandale</hi> has a very pretty one, with a fine Garden incloſed with a Brick Wall, a thing hardly to be ſeen any-where elſe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the want of which is the Reaſon why the Wall-fruit does not thrive ſo well as it would otherwiſe do; for the Stone does not hold the Warmth of the Sun, after it is gone, as the Bricks do.</p>
            <p>But the Beauty of this Part of the Country is <hi>Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Houſe, built upon a delightful Plain, on the Bank of the River. It was originally a Square, but there are two Wings lately joined to it, which add greatly to the Beauty of the Building. The Situation is ſo extremely good, and gives ſo elegant a Proſpect as well to the Sea as to the Land, that nothing can be finer. It is exquiſitely finiſhed both within and without; and there are ſome Pieces of curious Painting in it, beſides a great Number of Family Pictures. The Stables and Riding-place are by far the fineſt and moſt magnificent in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and his Lordſhip, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in good Horſes, has the beſt, without Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, in all the Country. <hi>Hawthornden</hi> alſo is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for its Caves hewn out of the Rock, and <hi>Roſlin</hi> for a great ſtately Chapel.</p>
            <p>From hence the Firth widens again, and ſoon after is three or four Miles wide, and makes a ſafe and deep Road, with good Anchor-ground, where, if there was a Trade to anſwer it, a thouſand Sail of Ships of any Burden might ſafely ride.</p>
            <p>On the South-ſhore, upon a narrow Point of Land running into the Water, ſtands <hi>Blackneſs</hi> Caſtle, wherein State-priſoners were confined in former Times, eſpecially ſuch as were taken up for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Differences, many of whom miſerably periſhed here, either by the Unhealthineſs of the Place, Want of Conveniencies, or ſomething worſe. This Caſtle might be of Uſe, if the Harbour was frequented; but

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I entered the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Scotland</hi> at <hi>Berwick upon Tweed,</hi> and have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on my Account through the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> ſo, having travelled over the Weſt Part at another Journey, when I went from <hi>England</hi> by a different Road, I ſhall here give you the Particulars of that alſo.</p>
            <p>Paſſing the River <hi>Eſk,</hi> or (as it is commonly called) the <hi>Solway Firth,</hi> beyond <hi>Carliſle,</hi> we entered <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on the Side of <hi>Dumfriesſhire.</hi> The Diviſion of this County into <hi>Eſkdale, Nithſdale,</hi> and <hi>Annan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> is but the ordinary marking out the Rivers <hi>Eſk, Annan,</hi> and <hi>Nith,</hi> as I obſerved of the Rivers <hi>Teeſdale, Tyndale, Swaledale,</hi> and others, in the North of <hi>England</hi>; for the whole Province makes but one Shire; <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Dumfries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0141100404:99"/>The <hi>Eſk</hi> is a pretty large River, and gives Name to the South-eaſt Part of this County; but we ſaw very little near it, worth our Notice, except <hi>Kirſop,</hi> a very ſmall Town on a River of the ſame Name, which afterwards falls into the <hi>Eſk,</hi> and is famous for being the Place where, by a Treaty, after the Battle of <hi>Pinkey,</hi> the Limits or Borders of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were ſettled; tho' the Borderers did not long obſerve it, but robbed and plundered one another upon all Occaſions, as Opportunity offered.</p>
            <p>This River ſoon leaves <hi>Scotland,</hi> and running into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Border, empties itſelf into the <hi>Solway</hi> Firth, which receives all the Rivers on this Part of the Iſland, as well from <hi>England</hi> as from <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Place of Note we came to in <hi>Scotland</hi> was <hi>Annand,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Annandale,</hi> which, being a Sea-port, and having a good Harbour, was once a Town of pretty good Trade; but it was often taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who, at laſt, burnt it to the Ground in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. from which it never recovered. Here was a good Salmon Fiſhery, and a Trade to <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>Iſle of Man</hi>; but moſt of the Merchants, and Men of Subſtance, being removed to <hi>Dumfries</hi> the Town continues, to all Appearance, in a State of irrevocable Decay.</p>
            <p>The Town and Caſtle of <hi>Lockmaben</hi> is a Royal Burgh as well as <hi>Annand.</hi> Three Parts of it are ſurrounded by Lakes, which afford excellent Fiſh, and one particularly which is found no-where elſe. The Caſtle, as well as that of <hi>Annand,</hi> is now demoliſhed.</p>

                  </gap>ffet</hi> is remarkable for its medicinal Springs. They riſe from the Top of a Rock near the Town: There are two Wells near one another. The Waters purge and vomit, and are very good againſt Colicky and Nephritical Pains, powerfully removing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the Bowels. They are applied out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to Ulcers, and for Pains in the Joints. They
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0141100404:100"/>
have more Virtue in dry Seaſons, and in Summer and Autumn, than in Winter and rainy Weather.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Rivel</hi> alſo deſerves to be mention'd, on account of a very good Salt made out of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sand there, which they gather up and boil.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Annand,</hi> keeping the Sea as cloſe as we could to the Left, we went on due Weſt to <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fries,</hi> a Sea-port Town at the Mouth of the River <hi>Nid,</hi> or <hi>Nith,</hi> which gives Name to the third Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the County, called <hi>Nithſdale</hi>; but this Town is the Capital of the whole Shire, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of all the South-weſt Part of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Here, as in ſome few other Ports on this Side of the Iſland, the Benefits of Commerce, obtained to this Country by the Union, appear much more viſible than on the Eaſt-ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dumfries</hi> was always a good Town, with large Streets, and full of reputable and wealthy Merchants, who trade into foreign Parts, and employ a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Number of Ships, eſpecially ſince they have embarked in Trade to <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations. This Town is alſo advantageouſly ſituated for an Increaſe of Commerce on the River <hi>Nid,</hi> or <hi>Nith</hi>; for tho' it ſtands near two Leagues from the Sea, yet the Tide flows up to the Town, and Ships of Burden come cloſe up to the Key, and about four Miles below it the largeſt Merchant-ſhips in <hi>Britain</hi> may ride in Safety.</p>
            <p>Over the River <hi>Nith,</hi> is a very fine Stone-bridge, at this Place, with nine Arches, and ſo broad, that two Coaches may go abreaſt on it. Here they have alſo an Exchange for the Merchants, a handſome Church, a <hi>Tolbooth</hi> or Priſon, and a Town-hall for the Uſe of the Magiſtrates. They had formerly a Woolen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture here; but the Union has, in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſuppreſſed theſe Things in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſupplying them much better and cheaper: yet, at the ſame time, it muſt be obſerved, that the <hi>Scots</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0141100404:101"/>
have more than an Equivalent by an open Trade to <hi>England,</hi> and all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle in this Town is very old, yet is ſtill pretty good and ſtrong. This Caſtle, as well as that at <hi>Carlavrok,</hi> near the Mouth of the River, which has been a very magnificent Structure, belonged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to the antient Family of the <hi>Maxwells,</hi> Earls of <hi>Nithſdale,</hi> the only remaining Branch of which, being unhappily embarked in the late Rebellion, and taken in Arms at <hi>Preſton,</hi> made his Eſcape out of the Tower, and is now abroad, under Forfeiture.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Town of <hi>Dumfries</hi> exerted themſelves in a diſtinguiſhing manner for the preſent Eſtabliſhment, in the Year 1715. fortify'd the Town at a great Expence, and provided themſelves with Arms and Ammunition: This involving them in a larger Debt, an Act paſſed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1716. for laying a Duty of Two Pennies <hi>Scots</hi> upon every <hi>Scots</hi> Pint of Ale or Beer ſold within the Town and its Privileges, for paying the ſaid Debts, and for building a new Church, the other being not capacious enough to hold the Inhabitants; and alſo to make a convenient Harbour there, for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Ships, and Improvement of Trade.</p>
            <p>This Act enabled them to make ſome Progreſs in the deſign'd Projections; but the Town having been forced to rebuild Part of their old Church, the Council-houſe and Priſon, which were become ruinous, they were render'd unable to proceed in the moſt uſeful Parts of their Undertaking; and as the Act expired in the 10th of King <hi>George</hi> II. they procured the ſame to be continued in that Seſſion for 25 Years longer; and alſo an additional Duty on the Tonnage of Shipping, and on Goods imported and exported into and out of the Port of <hi>Dumfries:</hi> Which they hope will enable them completely to finiſh all they intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0141100404:102"/>There are many conſiderable Woods in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the chief of which is <hi>Holy Wood,</hi> where was an Abbey, which gave Surname to the famous Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger <hi>Johannes de Sacro Boſco,</hi> or <hi>Holy Wood. Drumlanrick</hi> alſo, the noble Palace of the Duke of <hi>Queenſberry,</hi> is remarkable for its Wood of Oak ſix Miles long.</p>
            <p>At this Town the River <hi>Nith</hi> parts the Stewarty of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and the Shire of <hi>Dumfries</hi>; and in the middle of the Bridge over it, is a Gate, which is the Limit between them. This Neighbourhood of <hi>Galloway,</hi> which is a great and rich Province, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the Trade of this Place very much.</p>
            <p>In <hi>November</hi> 1740. here was a great Struggle, in View to the Elections of Members for the ſucceeding Parliament, and the Town of <hi>Dumfries</hi> ſignaliz'd themſelves by the following extraordinary Act; which we ſhall give, without making any Remarks upon it, or the Occaſion of it:<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <p>"At <hi>Dumfries, Auguſt</hi> 23. 1740. The ſaid Day, the Deacon Convener, and Deacons of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Corporations, having the Advice and Conſent of the Grand Committee, and of the Community and whole Members of the Corporations, taking to their Conſideration the Reports and Suſpicions now going current upon Perſons ſetting up for Deacons, and the offering, and giving or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Compliments, Rewards, Gifts, Remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and good Deeds by themſelves, or Truſtees interpoſed, or Perſons for their Behoof, either at this preſent, or at a greater Diſtance, with Proſpect and View of the Election for the five Burghs, for the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> when the enſuing Seſſion is determined; and being deſirous to ſuppreſs ſuch Methods, and any Report thereof; do, according to all Laws, Divine and Human, Equity and Reaſon, enact and declare, and be it enacted and declared by

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We could not paſs <hi>Dumfries,</hi> without going out of our Way to ſee the Caſtle of <hi>Drumlanrig,</hi> the fine Palace of the Duke of <hi>Queenſberry,</hi> juſt mentioned, which ſtands at 12 Miles Diſtance, upon the ſame River. The Vale on either Side is pleaſant, and tolerably good: But when theſe rapid Rivers over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0141100404:104"/>
their Banks, they do not, like <hi>Nile,</hi> or even like the <hi>Thames,</hi> and other Southern Streams, fatten and enrich the Soil; but, on the contrary, they lodge ſo much Sand and Splinters of Stone upon the Surface of the Earth, and among the Roots of the Graſs, that it ſpoils and beggars it; nay, the Water is ſometimes hurried on with ſuch Force, that it waſhes the beſt Part of the Earth away, where the Soil is light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Drumlanrig</hi> is like a fine Picture in a dirty Grotto, or an Equeſtrian Statue ſet up in a Barn. It is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with Mountains, which have the wildeſt and moſt hideous Aſpect of any in all the South Part of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were not ſo ſurpriſed with the Height of the Mountains, and the Barrenneſs of the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, as we were with the Manners of the People, who are not ſo poliſhed here, as in the other Parts of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But what was moſt wonderful, was to ſee ſo glorious a Palace, with ſuch fine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and every thing about it ſo truly magnificent, ſtanding in a wild and mountainous Country, where nothing but what was deſolate and diſmal could be expected. However, the Situation, like that of <hi>Chatſworth</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> is certainly a Foil to the Buildings, and ſets them off with greater Advantage.</p>
            <p>If you come to the Palace by the Road, which leads to it from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> you paſs the River <hi>Nith,</hi> which is there both broad and deep, over a ſtately Stone-bridge, erected by the noble Founder of the Caſtle, and Builder of the Houſe, the firſt Duke of <hi>Queensberry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Building is Four-ſquare, with Roundels in the inner Angles of the Court, in every one of which is a Stair-caſe, and a kind of Tower on the Top. It ſtands on the Summit of a riſing Ground, which is beautifully laid out in Slopes and Terraces. At the Extent of the Gardens are Pavilions and Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0141100404:105"/>
exactly anſwering to one another; and the Greens, Eſpaliers, and Hedges, are in great Perfection.</p>
            <p>The Apartments are fine and richly furniſhed. The Gallery is filled from one End to the other with Family Pictures of the Duke's Anceſtors, moſt of them at full Length, and in their Robes of State, or of Office. <hi>William,</hi> the firſt of the Family, was a younger Son of <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglas,</hi> who got the Barony of <hi>Drumlanrig</hi> by a Deed from his Father, as his Portion, in the Time of King <hi>Robert</hi> III. He was afterwards ſent Embaſſador to <hi>England</hi> to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom King <hi>James</hi> I. who was detained there. In the Year 1708. the late Duke of <hi>Queenſberry</hi> was created Duke of <hi>Dover,</hi> as alſo Marquis of <hi>Beverly,</hi> and Baron of <hi>Rippon,</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Trip we made was to <hi>Galloway,</hi> ſo called from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> from whom the antient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants deſcended. It is divided into two different Diſtricts; that towards the Weſt is called the Shire of <hi>Wigton,</hi> and the other towards the Eaſt, which, as I ſaid before, begins at the middle of the Bridge of <hi>Dumfries,</hi> is called the Stewarty of <hi>Kirkcudbright,</hi> of which the <hi>Maxwells,</hi> Earls of <hi>Nithſdale,</hi> were Heretable Stewards. The Country hereabouts ſeems one continued Heath, proper for Grazing ſmall Cattle, which are generally ſold in <hi>England</hi>; and where-ever you perceive a Grove of Trees, you may depend upon it there is a Laird's Houſe near it, which are moſtly old Towers of Stone, ſtrongly built, to prevent a Surprize from Inroads, which were frequent between the two Nations, before the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Town of Note on the Coaſt is <hi>Kirkcud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright:</hi> Tho' its Situation is extremely convenient for carrying on a very advantageous Commerce, we ſaw nothing but a Harbour without Ships, a Port without Trade, and a Fiſhery without Nets. This
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0141100404:106"/>
is owing partly to the Poverty, and partly to the Diſpoſition of the Inhabitants, who are indeed a ſober, grave, religious Sort of People, but have no Notion of acquiring Wealth by Trade; for they ſtrictly obey the Scriptures in the very Letter of the Text, by <hi>being content with ſuch Things as they have.</hi> The River <hi>Dee,</hi> which enters the Sea here, and forms the Harbour, comes out of the Mountains near <hi>Carrick,</hi> and is ſo full of Turnings and Meanders, that, tho' it is not above 70 Miles in a Line, it runs near 200 Miles in its Courſe.</p>
            <p>The Country of <hi>Galloway</hi> lies due Weſt from <hi>Dumfries</hi>; and as that Part of it they call the <hi>Upper Galloway</hi> runs out farther into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas than the reſt, all that Bay on the South-ſide may be reckoned Part of <hi>Solway Firth,</hi> as all on the North-ſide is called the <hi>Firth of Clyde,</hi> tho' near 50 Miles from the River itſelf.</p>
            <p>The Weſtern <hi>Galloway,</hi> or the Shire of <hi>Wigton,</hi> runs out with a Peninſula ſo far into the Sea, that from the utmoſt Shores you ſee the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> as plain as you ſee <hi>Calais</hi> from <hi>Dover. Port Patrick,</hi> which is the ordinary Place for the Ferry or Paſſage to <hi>Belfaſt</hi> and other Ports in <hi>Ireland,</hi> has a tolerable good Harbour, and a ſafe Road; but there is very little Uſe for it; the Packet-boat, and a few fiſhing Veſſels, are the Sum of its Navigation. There was nothing here to invite our Stay; for 'tis a mean dirty homely Place: and as we had no Buſineſs but to ſee the Coaſt, we came away very ill ſatisfied with our Accommodation. Upon a Hill near the Town, we could plainly ſee <hi>Ireland</hi> to the South-weſt, the Coaſt of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of Man</hi> to the South-eaſt, and the <hi>Iſle of Ila,</hi> and the Mull of <hi>Kintyre,</hi> to the North-weſt.</p>
            <p>As we paſſed into the Peninſula, we ſtopt at <hi>Stranrawer,</hi> ſituate on the North-ſide of the Iſthmus, which is formed by two Arms of the Sea; one on
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0141100404:107"/>
the North-ſide, called <hi>Lochrain</hi>; and the other on the South, called the Bay of <hi>Glenluce.</hi> On each Side of this Iſthmus is an excellent Road for Ships: But we could diſcover no Genius in the People for Trade, or for Sea Affairs of any Kind.</p>
            <p>Six Miles South of <hi>Wigton</hi> lies <hi>Whithern,</hi> the antient <hi>Candida Caſa,</hi> a Royal Burgh, but very poor, eſpecially ſince the Diſſolution of the Priory. In this Town was the Seat of the Biſhop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> which was founded by St. <hi>Ninian</hi> about 1200 Years ago.</p>
            <p>But tho' the People of <hi>Galloway,</hi> eſpecially on the Sea Coaſt, are much to blame for not falling in to Commerce, Navigation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they are not quite idle; for they are great Cultivators of the Earth, and Breeders of Cattle, of which they ſend above 50000 Head every Year to <hi>England.</hi> Beſides, they have the beſt Breed of ſtrong, low, punch Horſes in <hi>Britain,</hi> if not in <hi>Europe,</hi> which are from thence called <hi>Galloways.</hi> Theſe Horſes, which are very much bought up in <hi>England,</hi> are remarkable for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good natural Pacers, ſtrong, eaſy Goers, hardy, gentle, well-broken, and, above all, not apt to tire.</p>
            <p>Proceeding from <hi>Lower Galloway</hi> hither, we had like to have been driven down the Stream of a River, tho' a Countryman went before for our Guide; for the Water ſwelled upon us as we paſſed, and the Stream was very ſtrong, ſo that we were obliged to turn our Horſes Heads to the Current, and ſloping over, edg'd near the Shore by Degrees; whereas, if our Horſes had ſtood directly croſs the Stream, they could not have kept their Feet. The Inhabitants follow Fiſhing, as well in the Sea, as in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Loughs, which lie every-where under the Hills; it which, about <hi>September,</hi> they catch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Number of excellent Eels; by which they are no leſs Gainers, than by their little Horſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0141100404:108"/>This Part of the Country is very mountainous, and ſome of the Hills prodigiouſly high; but they were all covered with Sheep, and other Cattle, the Gentlemen hereabouts being the greateſt Sheep-maſters, (for ſo they call themſelves) and the greateſt Breeders of Black Cattle and Horſes, in the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We now entered the Shire of <hi>Aire,</hi> full North from the Mull, or North-point of <hi>Galloway:</hi> And as we, before, coaſted the South Bay, or Firth of <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> which parts <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo now we coaſted the Firth of <hi>Clyde,</hi> which, for near 60 Miles, lies on the Weſt-ſide of the Shore, ſtanding away North-eaſt from the Point of the Mull. This Shire is divided into three great Bailleries; <hi>viz. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Kyle,</hi> and <hi>Cunningham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carrick</hi> is a more fruitful and better cultivated Country than <hi>Galloway,</hi> and not ſo mountainous; but it does not ſo much abound in Cattle, eſpecially Sheep and Horſes. Tho' there is no conſiderable Port in this Part of the Country, yet the People begin to trade here, and thoſe who live towards the Coaſt are great Fiſhermen, and are employed by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and other Places, to catch Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for them. <hi>May-bole</hi> is the chief Town; but tho' it ſtands on the Coaſt, it has no Harbour, and is poor and decayed. The Market is pretty good, becauſe there are many Gentlemen in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and the Coaſt near it full of People; but the Houſes are mean, low, and very coarſe. The Family of <hi>Kennedy,</hi> Earls of <hi>Caſſils,</hi> are or were Lords of great Part of the Country, and have a good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Seat; but we did not go to ſee it.</p>
            <p>Coming to the North Bounds of <hi>Carrick,</hi> we paſſed the River <hi>Dun</hi> over a Bridge of one Arch, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 90 Feet; which is much larger than the <hi>Rialto</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> or the middle Arch of the great Bridge at <hi>York.</hi> We found many large ones in this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0141100404:109"/>
Country, tho' I think, none ſo large as this, except at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and <hi>Stirling.</hi> This Bridge led us into the County of <hi>Kyle,</hi> the ſecond Diviſion of the Shire of <hi>Aire.</hi> Here I obſerved, that, contrary to our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, we found, the farther North we travelled, the Country was the finer, better, and richer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kyle</hi> is more populous than <hi>Carrick</hi>; and the Soil being better here, and the Country more plain and level, ſo on the Banks of the River there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gentlemens Seats, tho' moſt of them are built Caſtle-wiſe, becauſe of Enemies. But that Fear being now over, they begin to plant and incloſe after the Manner of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Writers tell us a long Story of a great Battle in this Country between <hi>Coilus,</hi> or <hi>Kylus,</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> King, and their <hi>Fergus</hi> I. where the former was killed, and from thence the Country took his Name. Many Monuments of this Battle are ſtill to be ſeen here. The Place where were it was fought is called <hi>Coil-field</hi>; a Church near it, is called <hi>Coil-town</hi> Kirk. The River near which it was won, and which falls into the River <hi>Aire,</hi> four Miles above the Town of <hi>Aire,</hi> is called <hi>Coil</hi>; a Lake not far from it, near which the <hi>Scots</hi> encamped, is called <hi>Lake Fergus.</hi> A Trumpet reſembling a crooked Horn, which has a very ſhrill Sound, was digged up in the Field of Battle, and is ſtill kept in the Laird of <hi>Caprington</hi>'s Houſe, called <hi>Coil-field,</hi> and made uſe of to call his Servants and Workmen together. Here, or, as ſome ſay, at <hi>Largis</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Clyde,</hi> was another bloody Battle in the Year 1263. between King <hi>Alexander</hi> III. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Acho,</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> who came to the Port of <hi>Aire</hi> with a great Fleet of Ships, and 20,000 Men, who, after ravaging the Country, was routed, and loſt both his Army, and 140 Ships. At this laſt Battle, an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentleman, of the Name of <hi>Mackenzie,</hi> behaved ſo well, that King <hi>Alexander</hi> gave him the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0141100404:110"/>
Lands of <hi>Kintail,</hi> which continued in the Poſſeſſion of the Earl of <hi>Seaforth,</hi> his Succeſſor, till the late Earl taking Part with the Pretender, his Eſtate became forfeited. From this brave <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> are deſcended the numerous Name of <hi>Mackenzie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Over the River <hi>Aire</hi> is a Bridge of Four Arches, near the new Town; and South of the Bridge ſtands the old Town of <hi>Aire</hi> or <hi>Erigena,</hi> famous for its Antiquity and Privileges. It has a very large Juriſdiction of near 64 Miles, reaching from the Mouth of <hi>Clyde</hi> to the Borders of <hi>Galloway.</hi> It ſtands on a ſandy Plain, but has pleaſant green Fields two Miles South and North of it. In the Fields betwixt the Mouth of the River <hi>Dun</hi> and <hi>Aire,</hi> ſtands a very beautiful Church. The Town has a very good Harbour in the River, and lies conveniently for Trade: And 'tis eaſy to ſee, that it has been much larger, than it is at preſent. It is now like an old Beauty, and ſhews the Ruins of a good Face, but is ſtill decaying every Day; and from having been the fifth beſt Town in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the Townſmen ſay, it is now the fifth worſt; which is owing to the Decay of its Trade: So true it is, that Commerce is the Life of Cities, of Nations, and even of Kingdoms. What was the Reaſon of the Decay of Trade in this Place, is not eaſy to determine, the People themſelves being either unwilling or unable to tell. Here, over the River <hi>Irvin,</hi> which divides <hi>Aire</hi> from <hi>Cunningham,</hi> is a good Bridge of four Arches. <hi>Aire</hi> is noted for the treacherous Murder of many Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Wallace</hi>'s Time; when they were called together during a Truce (after <hi>Edward</hi> I. had over-run the Country) on Pretence of holding a Court of Juſtice, and were treacherouſly hanged one after another, as they entered the King's large Barns, where the Court was held.</p>
            <p>This was as ſeverely, as juſtly, revenged by <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> with whom, as Warden of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they had
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0141100404:111"/>
made the Truce, and whom they endeavoured to entice thither by their Charter of Peace, as they had done a great many others of Quality. But he, having Notice of what had paſſed, ſurpriſed them that very Night in their Jollity, rejoicing that they had, as they thought, by theſe treacherous Murders, ſecured <hi>Scotland</hi> for ever; and having ſet Guards round the Barn, that none ſhould eſcape, he burnt all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in them. The Ruins of thoſe Barns are ſtill ſhewn here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> built a Citadel at <hi>Aire,</hi> well fortify'd with a Foſſe, and a Stone Wall. At the Reſtoration it was demoliſhed; and at preſent only ſome Houſes, and Angles of the Ramparts, are ſtanding.</p>
            <p>Two Miles North of <hi>Aire</hi> Town ſtands <hi>Kincaſe,</hi> which has been, from Time immemorial, a Place of Retirement for Leprous Perſons.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Aire,</hi> keeping ſtill North, we came to <hi>Irwin,</hi> upon a River of the ſame Name. Here they have a Port, which formerly was in much better Condition than it had been for ſome Years paſt, the Harbour being ſo much decay'd by Length of Time, and other Accidents, that the Trade of the Town began to decay; for the Water not being confined to its proper Chanel, the Harbour became ſo choaked up with Sand-Banks, that it was of little Uſe to what it had been; ſo that Ships of very ſmall Burden were freqently ſhut up for ſeveral Months in the River, before they could ſail out to Sea. At the ſame time the Town-houſe, Church, Streets, and other publick Works, as the common Gaol, and one of the Arches of the Bridge, were all in a ruinous Condition: All which occaſion'd an Act of Parliament to paſs in the Ninth of King <hi>George</hi> II. for laying a Duty of Two-pennies <hi>Scots</hi> upon every <hi>Scots</hi> Pint of Ale or Beer ſold in the Town of <hi>Irvin,</hi> and its Liberties; and a Duty of a Penny Sterling
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0141100404:112"/>
upon every Ton of Coals ſhipped off for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation. By which means the Harbour will ſoon be reſtored to its priſtine Goodneſs, and the Town to its former flouriſhing Condition. But thus much muſt be ſaid, that notwithſtanding the declining Condition of its Harbour, before this Act paſſed, it carried on a greater Trade, than moſt of the Ports between <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Dumfries.</hi> Their chief Trade is in <hi>Scots</hi> Coal, which they export in great Quantities to <hi>Ireland</hi>; for the neighbouring Hills abound with this Commodity. <hi>Irvin</hi> is the Capital of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Shire of <hi>Aire,</hi> which they call <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> and is really within the Firth of <hi>Clyde,</hi> tho' not actually within the River itſelf. The Name of <hi>Cunningham</hi> ſignifies, <hi>the King's Habitation,</hi> from the Beauty of its Situation.</p>
            <p>As it has more Trade than the other Parts I have been ſpeaking of, ſo it is better built. Here are two handſome Streets, a good Quay, and a capacious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The Country is rich and fruitful, filled with Gentlemens Seats and well-built Houſes; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you turn your Eye, you ſee nothing but beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Encloſures, pleaſant Paſtures, and Graſs Grounds, ſo that we thought ourſelves in <hi>England</hi> again. It is ſaid, this incloſing the Ground was owing to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers, who were placed here and in <hi>Kyle</hi> by <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> (for at <hi>Aire</hi> he built a Citadel, as I have ſaid); theſe prompted and encouraged the People to incloſe and improve their Lands, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them in the Manner of Huſbandry practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> which they have not forgot to this Day.</p>
            <p>A very extraordinary Storm of Thunder and Lightning happened here, on the 26th of <hi>November</hi> 1740. which deſerves to be taken notice of, for the Terror it occaſion'd, it being equally uncommon for the Seaſon of the Year, and the Climate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0141100404:113"/>At Noon began to fall a very heavy Rain, which ended in ſuch a Shower of large Hail, that every body betook themſelves to Shelter from its Violence. This was followed with a ſudden and moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Flaſh of Fire, and Crack of Thunder. The Lightning accompanied the Thunder, which did not continue rolling, as uſually, ſhort and quick; but the Noiſe ſeemed greater and more frightful, than as if all the Ordnance on Earth had been at one Inſtant diſcharged. The Whole ſeemed to break upon the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> and Steeple; drove in much of the Roof on two Sides, ſo as Waggons might paſs thro'; the Steeple was much ſhattered, and the Crevices large. The Town-clock was broke to Pieces, the Work either calcin'd or melted. The ſtrong Door of the Priſon was burſt up (notwithſtanding its large iron Bars). A Lad of Fourteen was killed as he ſtood at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and his Cloaths intirely conſumed; his Brother, aged Twelve, was thrown down near by him; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Brother was ſtruck blind; their Aunt had all her Cloaths burnt to Aſhes on one Side, and even her Skin flay'd off, worſe than could have been done by any Bliſtering-plaiſter; her other Side ſeem'd untouch'd. 'Tis obſervable, that not one Bone of any of them was broken, tho' every Hair was ſinged, and that the ſulphureous Stench about them was intolerable. Many other Perſons were alſo grievouſly hurt. Two Sailors coming from the Quay, ſaid, that a large Pillar of Fire ſtruck them in the Face, which brought them to their Knees. One Mr. <hi>Cunningham</hi> ſaid, it appear'd to him as a moſt voluminous Pillar of Fire, proceeding quick as from the Mouth of Cannon; and, that he thought, from the uncommon Smoke over the <hi>Tolbooth,</hi> that it had been all on Fire; he was thrown down, and his Foot much hurt. The People had ſcarce recovered their Senſes, when two other Cracks of Thunder gave freſh Grounds of Terror; ſo that it was apprehended the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0141100404:114"/>
General Judgment approached, and every one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated themſelves in Humility, imploring Mercy from on high; but theſe laſt, tho' terrible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, were nothing to the firſt. Great hewn Stones were carried violently out of the Steeple to Baillie <hi>Neſbitt</hi>'s Houſe, where they left Impreſſions.</p>
            <p>A little from <hi>Irvin</hi> ſtood <hi>Kilmarnock</hi> Caſtle, the Seat of the Family of the <hi>Boyds,</hi> Earls of <hi>Kilmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> which on the 15th of <hi>March</hi> 1738-9. was intirely conſumed, with the Furniture, and a curious Collection of Books in MSS. nothing being ſaved but the Charter-cheſt. On the other Side is the Caſtle of <hi>Eglington,</hi> the Seat of the antient Family of the <hi>Montgomeries,</hi> Earls of <hi>Eglington.</hi> On the North-eaſt Borders of this County, where it joins to <hi>Clydſdale,</hi> is the Caſtle of <hi>London,</hi> the noble and beautiful Seat of the Earl of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Bay of <hi>Clyde</hi> ſtands the Town of <hi>Largis,</hi> famous for the Defeat of the <hi>Norwegians</hi> by King <hi>Alexander</hi> III. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which ſome give to <hi>Kyle,</hi> as we have ſaid above.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kilmaers,</hi> in the ſame County, is the Seat of the noble and antient Family of <hi>Cunningham,</hi> Earls of <hi>Glencairn. Camden</hi> ſays, that the Family derives its Original from one of that Name concerned in the Murder of <hi>Thomas à Becket,</hi> who fled into <hi>Scotland</hi> on that Account, and therefore bear an Epiſcopal Pall in their Arms; but it is plain from their Motto, <hi>Over, Fork, over,</hi> that it is a Fork, and not an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Pall: and the Family, no doubt, is of a much higher and nobler Original.</p>
            <p>In the Sea lies <hi>Lady Iſle,</hi> where is great Plenty of Rabbets and Fowl, but no Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>With the Diviſion of <hi>Cunningham</hi> I quitted the Shire of <hi>Aire,</hi> which is, without Exception, one of the pleaſanteſt Counties in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Joining to it North, and bordering on the <hi>Clyde</hi> itſelf, lies the Shire, or rather Barony of <hi>Renfrew,</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0141100404:115"/>
which was the antient Eſtate of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> before they ſucceeded to the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and his Royal Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> among other Titles, is now ſtyled Baron of <hi>Renfrew.</hi> It is a pleaſant, rich, and populous Country; and tho' the Soil is not thought to be ſo good as in <hi>Cunningham,</hi> yet that is abundantly recompenſed by the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and the <hi>Clyde,</hi> and the great Commerce of both.</p>
            <p>We kept our Rout from <hi>Irvin</hi> along the Coaſt, as near as we could; ſo that we ſaw all the Firth of the <hi>Clyde,</hi> and the very Opening itſelf, which is juſt at the Weſt-corner of this County. There are ſome Villages and Fiſhing Towns within the Mouth of this River which have good Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt Town of Note is called <hi>Greenock,</hi> which ſeems not to be an antient Place, but to be grown up in later Years by being a good Road for Ships to ride in that come into, and go out from <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> as Ships for <hi>London</hi> do in the <hi>Downs.</hi> The Town is well-built, has many rich trading Families in it, and a Caſtle to command the Road. It is the chief Place in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Herring Fiſhing; and the Merchants of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> who are concerned in it, employ their Veſſels for catching and curing the Fiſh, and for carrying them Abroad to Market afterwards; and their being ready on all Hands to go to Sea, makes them often leave the Care of their own Ships to the <hi>Greenock</hi> Men, who are good Seamen, and excellent Pilots for thoſe difficult Seas.</p>
            <p>At the Weſt-end of a Bay on the Firth is a ſmall Town, called <hi>Gowrock,</hi> where is a noted Road and Harbour lately fitted up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paiſley</hi> alſo ſtands in this County on the River <hi>Cart</hi>; and, tho' no Borough, is larger than <hi>Renfrew</hi>; and was formerly noted for its noble Abbey of the Order of <hi>Cluny</hi>; the Monks of which wrote a Chronicle called, <hi>The black Book of Paiſley.</hi> The
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0141100404:116"/>
Abbey and Church, with fair Gardens and Orchards, and a little Park for fallow Deer, are all incloſed with a Stone Wall about a Mile in Circuit: The Water of the River <hi>Whitecart,</hi> upon which <hi>Paiſley</hi> ſtands, is commended for its Largeneſs, and the Pearls frequently found thereabouts, and three Miles above. They commonly fiſh for them in Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and meet with them in a Shell-fiſh larger than an ordinary Muſcle, at the Bottom of the Water. It lies on the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Clyde</hi> over-againſt <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow.</hi> The Remains of the Abbey are ſtill to be ſeen, and the Town bears the Marks of having been fortified. At the Weſt-end of the Town are the Remains of a large <hi>Roman</hi> Camp and <hi>Praetorium,</hi> ſuppoſed to be vaulted underneath, becauſe the Ground, when trod upon, ſounds hollow. Here it was <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was defeated by her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects under the Baſtard Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> from whence ſhe took Refuge in <hi>England,</hi> and was there moſt <hi>inhoſpitably</hi> impriſoned for ſeveral Years, and at laſt beheaded. In the Lands of <hi>Newyards,</hi> near <hi>Paiſley,</hi> on a high Ground, is a Fountain noted for ebbing and flowing with the Tide.</p>
            <p>The Country between <hi>Paiſley</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> on the Bank of <hi>Clyde,</hi> I take to be one of the moſt agreeable Places in <hi>Scotland</hi> for its Situation, Ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Healthineſs, and for the Benefits it receives from the Neighbourhood of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and the Sea.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the Bank of <hi>Clyde</hi>; but my Method here, as in <hi>England,</hi> forbids my wandering North, till I have given you a full View of the South. The <hi>Clyde</hi> and the <hi>Forth</hi> may be ſaid to croſs <hi>Scotland</hi> here, their two Firths not being above 20 Miles diſtant from one another, which, if joined, would divide it very near in the Centre.</p>
            <p>Nor can I refrain mentioning how eaſy a Work it would be to make a Navigation from the <hi>Forth</hi> to the <hi>Clyde,</hi> joining the two Seas, as the King of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0141100404:117"/>
               <hi>France</hi> has done in a Place five hundred times more difficult, namely, from <hi>Tholouſe</hi> to <hi>Narbonne</hi>; and as the late Czar of <hi>Muſcovy, Peter,</hi> juſtly ſurnamed <hi>The Great,</hi> did in ſeveral Places of infinitely greater Difficulty and Expence. What an Advantage in Commerce would this be? It would eſtabliſh a Trade between <hi>Ireland</hi> and the Merchants in <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and open a Communication between the Weſt-coaſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Eaſt of <hi>England,</hi> even to <hi>London</hi>; nay, ſeveral Ports of <hi>England</hi> on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea, from <hi>Liverpool</hi> Northward, would all trade with <hi>London</hi> by ſuch a Canal. It would take up a Volume to lay down the ſeveral Advantages that would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately accrue from ſuch a Navigation, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in Times of War; but it muſt lie till Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by the riſing Greatneſs of their Commerce, ſhall not only feel the Want of it, but find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inclinable, as well as able, to effect it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glaſgow</hi> is the Emporium of the Weſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being, for its Commerce and Riches, the ſecond in this Northern Part of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> It is a large, ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and well-built City, ſtanding on a Plain, in a manner four-ſquare; and the four principal Streets are the faireſt for Breadth, and the fineſt built, that I have ever ſeen in one City together. The Houſes are all of Stone, and generally uniform in Height, as well as in Front. The lower Stories for the moſt part ſtand on vaſt ſquare <hi>Dorick</hi> Columns, with Arches which open into the Shops, adding to the Strength, as well as Beauty, of the Building. In a Word, 'tis one of the cleanlieſt, moſt beautiful, and beſt-built Cities in <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſtands on the Side of a Hill, ſloping to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; only that Part next the River, for near one-third of the City, is flat, and by this means, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Water upon any extraordinay Flood: It is ſituated upon the Eaſt Bank of the <hi>Clyde,</hi> which is not navigable to the Town but by ſmall Veſſels.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0141100404:118"/>
Its Port therefore is <hi>Newport-Glaſgow,</hi> which ſtands near the <hi>Clyde</hi>'s Mouth, and is an Harbour for Ships of the greateſt Burden. Here it is on a good Wharf or Quay the Merchants load and unload. Their Cuſtom-houſe is alſo here, and their Ships are here repaired, laid up, and fitted out either here or at <hi>Greenock,</hi> where Work is well done, and Labour cheap.</p>
            <p>The City is join'd to the Suburbs on the Weſt Bank of the <hi>Clyde</hi> by the noble Bridge I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>Where the four principal Streets meet, the Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing makes a very ſpacious Market-place, as may be eaſily imagined, ſince the Streets are ſo large. As we come down the Hill from the North-gate to this Place, the Tolbooth and Guild-hall make the North-weſt Angle, or Right-hand Corner of the Street, which is now rebuilt in a very magnificent Manner. Here the Town-council ſit, and the Magiſtrates try ſuch Cauſes as come within their Cognizance, and do all their other publick Buſineſs. So that, as will be eaſily conceived, the Tolbooth ſtands in the very Centre of the City. It is a noble Structure of hewn Stone, with a very lofty Tower, and melodious hourly Chimes. All theſe four principal Streets are adorned with ſeveral publick Buildings.</p>
            <p>But the chief Ornament of this City is the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege or Univerſity, a moſt magnificent and ſtately Fabrick, conſiſting of ſeveral Courts. The Front to the City is of hewn Stone, and excellent Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture. Its Precincts were lately inlarged by ſome Acres of Ground purchaſed for it by publick Money; and it is ſeparated from the reſt of the City by a very high Wall.</p>
            <p>It owes its Erection to Archbiſhop <hi>Turnbull,</hi> and was legally founded by King <hi>James</hi> II. in 1453. by virtue of a Bull from Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> V. granting it all the Privileges, Liberties, Honours, Immunities,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0141100404:119"/>
and Exemptions, given by the Apoſtolical See to the College of <hi>Bononia,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> for teaching Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Learning. A Rector, a Dean of the Faculty, a Principal or Warden, who was to teach Theology, three Philoſophy-Profeſſors, were eſtabliſhed by the firſt Foundation; and afterwards ſome Clergymen taught the Civil and Canon Law there.</p>
            <p>In 1577. King <hi>James</hi> VI. eſtabliſhed a Principal, three Profeſſors of Philoſophy, four Burſars, a Steward to furniſh their Table, a Servant for the Principal, a Janitor to look after the Gate, and a Cook.</p>
            <p>The Family of <hi>Hamilton</hi> gave ſome of the Ground on which the College ſtands, with an adjacent Field.</p>
            <p>Kings, Parliaments, the City of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> ſeveral of the Archbiſhops, and many particular Perſons, have been Benefactors to it.</p>
            <p>In 1662. the Earl of <hi>Dundonald</hi> gave 1000<hi>l.</hi> Sterling to it, for the Maintenance of poor Scholars. The great <hi>Buchanan,</hi> and the famous <hi>Cameron</hi> had, among other eminent Men, their Education here.</p>
            <p>Several fine <hi>Roman</hi> Stones, digged up in the Latter-end of 1740. near <hi>Kirkentilloch,</hi> with very curious Inſcriptions, have been removed to this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, where before was a good Collection of Pieces of Antiquity, chiefly found near the ſame Place.</p>
            <p>In the higher Part of the City ſtands the great Church, formerly Cathedral and Metropolitan, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to St. <hi>Mungo,</hi> who was Biſhop here about the Year 560. It is a magnificent and ſtately Edifice, and ſurpriſes the Beholders with its ſtupendous Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Workmanſhip of the Artizan. The ſeveral Rows of Pillars, and the exceeding high Spire which riſes from a ſquare Tower in the middle of the Croſs, ſhew a wonderful Piece of Architecture. It is now divided into ſeveral Preaching-places, one above the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0141100404:120"/>Near the Church ſtands a ruinous Caſtle, formerly the Reſidence of the Archbiſhop, who was legal Lord or Superior of the City, which ſtands on his Ground, and from whom it received its firſt Charter, and many Privileges. It is encompaſſed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high Wall of hewn Stone, and has a fine Proſpect into the City.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Montroſe</hi> has ſo great an Intereſt here, and in the Country round, that he is, in a Civil Senſe, Governor of this City, as he is legally of their Univerſity, and much beloved in theſe Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glaſgow</hi> is a City of Buſineſs, and has the Face of Foreign as well as Domeſtick Trade; nay, I may ſay, 'tis the only City in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at this Time, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently increaſes in both. The Union has, indeed, anſwered its End to them, more than to any other Part of the Kingdom, their Trade being new formed by it; for as the Union opened the Door to the <hi>Scots</hi> into our <hi>American</hi> Colonies, the <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Merchants preſently embraced the Opportunity; and tho', at its firſt concerting, the Rabble of this City made a formidable Attempt to prevent it, yet afterwards they knew better, when they found the great Increaſe of their Trade by it; for they now ſend near 50 Sail of Ships every Year to <hi>Virginia, New England,</hi> and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this City could have a Communication with the Firth of <hi>Forth,</hi> ſo as to ſend their Tobacco and Sugar by Water to <hi>Alloway</hi> below <hi>Stirling,</hi> as they might from thence again to <hi>London, Holland, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and the <hi>Baltick,</hi> they would very probably in a few Years double their Trade.</p>
            <p>The Share they have in the Herring Fiſhery is very conſiderable; and they cure their Herrings ſo well, and ſo much better than they are done in any other Part of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that a <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Herring is eſteemed as good as a <hi>Dutch</hi> one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0141100404:121"/>I have no room to inlarge upon the Home Trade of this City, which is very conſiderable in many Things. I ſhall therefore touch at ſome few Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here are two very handſome Sugar-baking Houſes, carried on by ſkilful Perſons, with large Stocks, and to a very great Perfection. Here is likewiſe a large Diſtillery for diſtilling Spirits from the Melaſſes drawn from Sugars, by which they enjoyed a vaſt Advantage for a Time, by a reſerved Article in the Union, freeing them from <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is a Manufacture of Plaiding, a Stuff croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriped with yellow, red, and other Mixtures, for the Plaids or Veils worn by the Women in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is a Manufacture of Muſlins, which they make ſo good and fine, that great Quantities of them are ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations, where they ſell at a good Price. They are generally ſtriped, and are very much uſed for Aprons by the Ladies, and ſometimes in Head-cloaths by the meaner Sort of <hi>Engliſhwomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is alſo a Linen Manufacture; but as that is in common with all Parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in it daily, I will not inſiſt upon it as a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar here, tho' they make a very great Quantity of it, and ſend it to the Plantations as their principal Merchandize: Nor are the <hi>Scots</hi> without a Supply of Goods for ſorting their Cargoes to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, without ſending to <hi>England</hi> for them; and it is neceſſary to mention it here, becauſe it has been objected by ſome, that the <hi>Scots</hi> could not ſend a ſortable Cargo to <hi>America,</hi> without buying from <hi>England</hi>; which, coming thro' many Hands, and by a long Carriage, muſt conſequently be ſo dear, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants can underſell them.</p>
            <p>It is very probable indeed, that ſome Things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had here ſo well as from <hi>England,</hi> ſo as to make out ſuch a ſortable Cargo as the <hi>Virginia</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0141100404:122"/>
in <hi>London</hi> ſhip off, whoſe Entries at the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe conſiſt ſometimes of two hundred Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as Tin, Turnery, Milanery, Upholſtery, Cutlery, and other <hi>Crooked-lane</hi> Wares; in ſhort, ſomewhat of every Thing, either for Wearing or Houſe-furniture, building Houſes or Ships.</p>
            <p>But tho' the <hi>Scots</hi> cannot do all this, we may reckon up what they can furniſh, which they have not only in ſufficient Quantities, but ſome in greater Perfection than <hi>England</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They have Woollen Manufactures of their own, ſuch as <hi>Stirling</hi> Serges, <hi>Muſſelburgh</hi> Stuffs, <hi>Aberdeen</hi> Stockens, <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Shalloons, Blankets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The Trade with <hi>England</hi> being open, they have now all the <hi>Mancheſter, Sheffield,</hi> and <hi>Birmingham</hi> Wares, and likewiſe the Cloths, Kerſeys, Half-thicks, Duffels, Stockens, and coarſe Manufactures of the North of <hi>England,</hi> brought as cheap or cheaper to them by Horſe-packs, as they are carried to <hi>London,</hi> it being at a leſs Diſtance.</item>
               <item>3. They have Linens of moſt Kinds, eſpecially Diapers and Table-linen, Damaſks, and many other Sorts not known in <hi>England,</hi> and cheaper than there, becauſe made at their own Doors.</item>
               <item>4. What Linens they want from <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> they import from thence as cheap as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can do, and for Muſlins, their own are very acceptable, and cheaper than in <hi>England.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. Gloves they make better and cheaper than in <hi>England</hi>; for they ſend great Quantities thither.</item>
               <item>6. Another Article, which is very conſiderable here, is Servants, which they can tranſport in greater Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and upon better Terms, than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſcandalous Art of Kidnapping, Wheedling, Betraying, and the like; for the poor People offer themſelves faſt enough, and think it their Advantage, as it certainly is, to ſerve out their Times ſoberly in the foreign Plantations, and then become diligent
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0141100404:123"/>
Planters for themſelves; which is a much wiſer Courſe than to turn Thieves, and then be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to ſave them from the Gallows. This may be given as a Reaſon, and, I believe, it is the only one, why ſo many more of the <hi>Scots</hi> Servants, who go over to <hi>Virginia,</hi> ſettle and thrive there, than of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; which is ſo certainly true, that if it holds on for many Years more, <hi>Virginia</hi> may be rather called a <hi>Scots</hi> than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I might mention many other Particulars; but this is ſufficient to ſhew, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants are not at a Loſs how to make up ſortable Cargoes to ſend to the Plantations; and that if we can outdo them in ſome things, they are able to outdo us in others. If they are under any Diſadvantages in the Trade I am ſpeaking of, it is that they may not, perhaps, have ſo eaſy a Vend and Conſumption for the Goods they bring back, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have at <hi>London, Briſtol,</hi> or <hi>Liverpool</hi>; for which Reaſon they have lately ſet up a Wharf at <hi>Alloway</hi> in the <hi>Forth,</hi> whence they ſend their Tobacco and Sugars thither by Land-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and ſhip them off from thence for <hi>Holland, Hamburgh,</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> as the Market offers; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they carry on a profitable Trade with <hi>England</hi> in Tobacco, which from the Difference of Duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do with no ſmall Advantage.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' the carrying their Tobacco and Sugars ſeveral Miles over Land may be ſome Diſadvantage, yet, if, on the other hand, it be calculated how much ſooner the Voyage is made from <hi>Glaſgow</hi> to the Capes of <hi>Virginia,</hi> than from <hi>London,</hi> the Difference will be made up in the Frieght, and in the Expence of the Ships, eſpecially in time of War, when the Chanel is thronged with Privateers, and the Ships wait to go in Fleets for fear of Enemies; for the <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are no ſooner out of the Firth of <hi>Clyde,</hi> but they ſtretch away to the North-weſt, are out of the Road of the Privateers immediately, and are often at the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0141100404:124"/>
Capes of <hi>Virginia</hi> before the <hi>London</hi> Ships get clear of the Chanel. Nay, even in times of Peace, there muſt always be allowed, one time with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, at leaſt fourteen or twenty Days Difference in the Voyage, both going out and coming in, which, taken together, is a Month or ſix Weeks in the whole Voyage; and conſidering Wear and Tear, Victuals and Wages, this makes a conſiderable Difference in the Trade.</p>
            <p>One thing ſtill I muſt take notice of, before I quit <hi>Glaſgow.</hi> I have mentioned, more than once, the Duties laid on Ale and Beer ſold in divers Towns in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the Benefit and publick Emolument of the ſaid Towns; but have here to take Notice of the like Duty laid for a different Purpoſe, that is to ſay, for a Puniſhment: The Caſe was this:</p>
            <p>When the Malt-Duty was extended for the firſt time to <hi>Scotland,</hi> it occaſioned much murmuring; and particularly <hi>Daniel Campbell,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who lived at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and was Member for that Town, having given his Vote for it in Parliament, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace roſe, enter'd his Houſe, deſtroy'd all his Goods and Furniture, and committed other Acts of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Outrage.</p>
            <p>This the Legiſlature reſenting as a Defiance of lawful Authority, an Act paſſed in the 12th of King <hi>George</hi> I. 1725. to take from the Town of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> the Benefits of an Act before paſſed, for laying a Duty of two Penies <hi>Scots</hi> on every Pint of Ale or Beer brewed for Sale in the ſaid City and its Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; and veſting it for the Remainder of the Term, which was for thirteen Years to come, (<hi>viz.</hi> from 1725. to 1738.) in his Majeſty, to be put under the Commiſſioners of Exciſe, in order to raiſe the Sum of 6080<hi>l.</hi> for ſatisfying the Damages and Loſſes ſuſtained by Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> in the ſaid Riot; but it was provided, that when the ſaid Sum was paid, the Duty of Two Penies <hi>Scots</hi> was to return, for the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0141100404:125"/>
Remainder of the Term, to the Magiſtrates, for the Purpoſes for which they were originally granted. This occaſioned no good Blood, it may be believed, between the City and Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>; but yet, this was not the laſt time this City had the Honour to be repreſented in Parliament by the ſame Gentleman, as it is joined with the Burghs of <hi>Renfrew, Ruglen,</hi> and <hi>Dunbarton!</hi>—So placable, and ſo forgiving, are the generous <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation! or, at leaſt, ſo little Title has the City of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> in particular to the National Motto of <hi>Scotland!</hi>—Nor did this good Behaviour of theirs turn out to its Diſadvantage; for in the 9th of <hi>George</hi> II. a new Act paſſed, continuing the former Act for Twenty-five Years longer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it to the Villages of <hi>Gorbells,</hi> and <hi>Port Glaſgow,</hi> both which Places were in the Juriſdiction of the City, and reaped all their Advantages from its Neighbourhood; the latter eſpecially, at which the People of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> had built, and conſtantly maintained, a very commodious Harbour, and yet were neither of them in the former Act.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Glaſgow</hi> I went eight Miles Southward to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> a Town pleaſant and well-built, the Church of which is the Burying-place of the Noble Family of <hi>Hamilton.</hi> But it is chiefly noted for its fine Palace, the Seat of the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> premier Peer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and nearly related to the Royal Family of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi> The Houſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is large, tho' Part of the Deſign is yet unfiniſhed. It has a fair Front, with two Wings, and two more are laid out in the Ichnography of the Building, which are not yet begun.</p>
            <p>The Front is very magnificent, all of white Free-ſtone, with regular Ornaments according to the Rules of Art. The Wings are very deep, and when the other two are added, the Sides of the Houſe will be like two large Fronts rather than Wings. The Apartments are very noble, and more fit for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0141100404:126"/>
the Court of a Prince, than the Houſe of a Subject. The Pictures, the Furniture, and other Decorations are exquiſitely fine, and ſuitable to the Dignity of the great Poſſeſſors. The late Ducheſs, marrying a Branch of the Family of <hi>Dowglas,</hi> obliged him to take the Name of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and ſo continue the Eſtate in her Name. Her Grace had ſix Sons, four of whom were Peers either by Birth or Creation; <hi>viz.</hi> The late Duke, who was killed in a Duel with Lord <hi>Mohun, Anno</hi> 1712. <hi>Charles,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Selkirk,</hi> ſo created by King <hi>James</hi> VII. <hi>John,</hi> Earl of <hi>Ruglen</hi>; and <hi>George,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Orkney.</hi> The other two were Lord <hi>Baſil,</hi> and Lord <hi>Archibald,</hi> late one of the Lords of the Admiralty.</p>
            <p>The Situation of the Houſe has all the Advantage imaginable; for it ſtands in a plain Country, near enough to the Banks of <hi>Clyde</hi> to enjoy the Proſpect of its Stream, and yet far enough from it to be out of the Reach of its Torrents and Floods.</p>
            <p>The great Park is about ſeven Miles in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and noted for its fine Oaks and Firs, and the ſmall River <hi>Aven</hi> runs thro' it. It is walled round with Stone, and well ſtock'd with Deer. The leſſer Park is rather a great Incloſure, than a Park; tho' this, as well as the other, is extremely well planted with Trees. The Gardens are finely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, but I can't ſay they are ſo well finiſhed and kept, as thoſe at <hi>Drumlanrig.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruglen</hi> is another Town in this County, which gives Title of Earl to a Branch of the Family of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> as has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Dowglas,</hi> which gives Title and Surname to the Dukes of <hi>Dowglas:</hi> Of which Family more anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crawford Lindſey,</hi> in this County, gives Title alſo to the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> who claims Precedency as firſt Earl.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0141100404:127"/>In <hi>Crawford-Moor,</hi> Gold has been found in the Sand of the Brooks after Rain, and that in pretty large Pieces, and they dug up <hi>Lapis Lazuli</hi> there. The Remains of a <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſeway are to be ſeen in this County from one End to the other.</p>
            <p>We then turned to the Left for <hi>Stirlingſhire,</hi> and, after paſſing the <hi>Clyde,</hi> came to <hi>Kilſyth,</hi> a good plain Country Burgh, tolerably well-built, but not large, near which the Marquis of <hi>Montroſs</hi> gave a great Overthrow to the Covenanters in the Civil Wars. Here, upon a particular Occaſion, we went to ſee the antient Seat of <hi>Calendar,</hi> which ſeems now in its Decline. The Town of <hi>Falkirk</hi> is near <hi>Calendar</hi> Houſe, but has nothing remarkable in it, except the other old decayed Houſe of the Earl of <hi>Calendar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we plainly ſaw the Remains of the antient Work, which they call <hi>Severus</hi>'s Wall, <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Wall, or <hi>Graham</hi>'s Dyke, for it is known by all theſe; built by the <hi>Romans</hi> croſs this narrow Part of the Country, and fortified with Redoubts and Stations to defend the South Country from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the <hi>Picts, Iriſh,</hi> and other wild Nations, in the <hi>Highlands.</hi> This Wall reached from <hi>Dunbriton Firth</hi> (ſo they called the Firth of <hi>Clyde</hi>) to the <hi>Forth,</hi> and was ſeveral times repaired, till the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <hi>Britain,</hi> with which it periſhed. Yet neither this, while it ſtood, nor the ſtronger one at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> called <hi>Severus</hi>'s Wall, could ſo well preſerve the Country from the Invaſion of <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> but the <hi>Romans</hi> were often obliged to ſend powerful Succours to the Relief of the diſtreſſed <hi>Britons. Camden</hi> thinks, that this Wall was built by <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> who being adopted by <hi>Adrian,</hi> aſſumed his Name. Be this as it will, 'tis certain, that in all the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Hiſtories, it is called <hi>Graham</hi>'s <hi>Dyke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Manner of the Wall is beſt underſtood by Mr. <hi>Pont</hi>'s Deſcription in Dr. <hi>Gibſon</hi>'s (now Lord
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0141100404:128"/>
Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>) Tranſlation of <hi>Camden</hi>'s <hi>Britannia,</hi> p. 959. Firſt, there appears a Ditch of 12 Feet wide before the Wall, towards the Enemies Country; the Wall is 10 Feet thick, but it is not known how high it was at firſt: There is a paved Way at the Foot of the Wall, five Feet broad, Watch-towers within Call of one another, where Centinels kept Watch Day and Night; a Court of Guard to lodge a ſufficient Number of Soldiers againſt all ſudden Alarms, and a Void within, for the Soldiers Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Beſides theſe, there are along the Wall great and noble Forts, ſtrongly intrench'd, and tho' within the Wall, able to receive a whole Army together. The Forts which remained in Mr. <hi>Pont</hi>'s Time, who traced them all, were theſe; one at <hi>Langtoun,</hi> a Mile Eaſt of <hi>Falkirk</hi>; one juſt at <hi>Rouintree Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>; one at <hi>Weſter-Gowden,</hi> about <hi>St. Helen</hi>'s Chapel; one at the <hi>Croykill</hi>; a very great one at the Top of the <hi>Banhill</hi>; one at <hi>Atchindevy</hi>; one at <hi>Kirkintilloch,</hi> or <hi>Kaerpencolloch</hi>; one at <hi>Eaſt-Calder</hi>; one at <hi>Hilltoun-Calder</hi>; one at <hi>Balmudy</hi>; one at <hi>Simerſtone,</hi> and over <hi>Kilvin</hi> River, and <hi>Careſtoun</hi>; one at <hi>Atermynie</hi>; one at <hi>Balcaſtle,</hi> over-againſt <hi>Banhil</hi>; one at <hi>Kaellybe,</hi> over-againſt <hi>Croy-hill</hi>; one at the <hi>Roch-hill,</hi> over-againſt the <hi>Weſt-wood</hi>; a large one at <hi>Bankyir,</hi> over-againſt <hi>Caſtle-Cairy</hi>; one at <hi>Dumbaſe:</hi> In the Ruins of that at <hi>Bankyir</hi> was found a large Iron Shovel, or ſome Inſtrument reſembling it, ſo weighty that it could hardly be lifted by one Man. At the ſame Fort alſo were diſcover'd ſeveral Sepulchres covered with large rough Stones; and at <hi>Dun-Chroe Chyr,</hi> by <hi>Mony-Abroch,</hi> were formerly large Buildings. The Length of the Wall was 36 <hi>Scots</hi> Miles, beginning between <hi>Queen's Ferry</hi> and <hi>Abercorn</hi>; it ranged along Weſt by the <hi>Grange</hi> and <hi>Kineil,</hi> to <hi>Innereving,</hi> ſo on to <hi>Falkirk</hi>; from whence it proceeded directly to the Foreſt of <hi>Cumernald</hi>; next, it ran to the great Fort at the <hi>Banhill,</hi> where have
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0141100404:129"/>
been found ſeveral Stones, ſome with Pictures en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon them, and with Inſcriptions. From whence it went to the <hi>Peel</hi> of <hi>Kirkintilloch,</hi> the greateſt Fort of all, and ſo Weſtward to <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> with a great Ditch upon the North-ſide of the Wall all along. It had alſo many ſquare Fortifications in form of <hi>Roman</hi> Camps.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Kilſyth</hi> we mounted the Hills, black and frightful as they were, to find the Road over the Moors and Mountains to <hi>Sterling</hi>; and being directed by Guides, we came to the River <hi>Carron.</hi> The Chanel of a River appeared, indeed, and looked as if it had been cut out by Art thro' horrid Precipices, to mark out a Courſe for the Water; but yet not a Drop was at that time to be ſeen. Great Stones, ſquare, and formed as if cut out by Hand, of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Size, lay ſcattered in a confuſed manner in the very Courſe of the River, which, as we were told, the Fury of the Water, at other times, had hurried down from the Mountains. If ſo, they muſt have been ſome Ages upon their Jouney down the Stream; for 'tis not probable, that a Flood often comes with a Force ſufficient to move ſuch Stones as theſe, unleſs a great Quantity of Ice, as well as Water, comes down upon them together. But in all Probability, they are not not driven down by the Force of the Water at all; but are <hi>Roman</hi> Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; of which more by-and-by.</p>
            <p>Here we paſſed another Bridge of one Arch, not quite ſo large as that we ſaw in <hi>Galloway,</hi> but very like it. 'Tis finely built of Free-ſtone, but the Shores being flat, it riſes ſo high, that it is not every Head can bear to ride over it. But there was a Neceſſity of building it with one Arch only; for no Piers in the middle of the Chanel could have borne the Shock of the great Stones, which ſometimes come down this Stream.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0141100404:130"/>From hence, deſcending on the North-ſide, we had a View of the Firth of <hi>Forth</hi> on our Right, and of the Caſtle of <hi>Stirling</hi> on our Left. In going to the latter, we paſſed the Water of <hi>Bannockburn,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the <hi>Scots</hi> Hiſtory for the great Battle fought here between King <hi>Robert de Bruce,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army commanded by King <hi>Edward</hi> II. in Perſon, in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were utterly overthrown, and that with ſo terrible a Slaughter, that tho' it was the greateſt Army that ever marched from <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> very few eſcaped, and the King with much ado ſaved himſelf by Flight. How he could ſave himſelf by a little Boat, (as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand, there being no River near, that had any Boats in it, but the <hi>Forth</hi>; and then the King muſt have fled North, whereas, to be ſure, he fled to <hi>England</hi> with all the Speed he could. He might, indeed, have made uſe of a Boat to paſs the <hi>Tweed,</hi> but that was at leaſt 50 Miles from the Field of Battle.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Scots</hi> magnify this Victory or not, is not my Buſineſs to inquire. 'Tis certain that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army was totally overthrown here; for they loſt 50000 Men, among whom were abundance of their Nobility and Gentry.</p>
            <p>This Place is alſo remarkable for the execrable Murder of King <hi>James</hi> III. whoſe young Son was by ſome diſcontented Nobles worked up to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Deed. But when his Underſtanding ripened, he ſaw the Action in its proper Light, and was ſo greatly affected by it, that he did Penance for ever after by conſtantly wearing an Iron Chain near his Fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sterling</hi> was our next Stage, an antient Town, and an important Paſs, which, together with <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> is the Defence of the Lowlands againſt the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands; for, as one very knowingly ſaid, <hi>Dumbarton</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0141100404:131"/>
is the Lock of the Highlands, and <hi>Stirling</hi> Caſtle keeps the Key. The Town is ſituated, exactly as <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> on the Ridge of a Hill, ſloping down on both Sides, and the Street gradually aſcending from the Eaſt to the Caſtle, which is at the Weſt-end. It is large and well-built, and tho' it is antient, yet the Buildings are not unlike thoſe of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church is alſo a very ſpacious Building, but not Collegiate. It ſtands in the upper Part of the Town, towards the End, is of good Architecture, and adorned with a lofty Tower. There was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a Church, or rather a Collegiate Chapel, in the Caſtle, and likewiſe a private Chapel, or Oratory, in the Palace, for the Royal Family; but they have been long diſuſed.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle is not ſo very difficult of Acceſs as that at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but is eſteemed equally ſtrong; for the Works are capable to mount more Cannon, and there is a Battery that commands the Bridge, which is of the utmoſt Importance, and ſeems to have been the main End and Purpoſe for which it was built. The Walls, and all the Outworks, are ſo firm, that they ſeem in as good Condition, as if they had been lately built.</p>
            <p>The Palace and Royal Apartments are very magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, but are all in Decay, and likely to continue ſo. This is at preſent alſo the Fate of the Palaces of <hi>Linlithgow, Falkland, Dumfermling,</hi> and all the other Royal Houſes in <hi>Scotland, Holy-rood-houſe</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>In the Park adjoining to the Caſtle were formerly large Gardens. The Figure of the Walks and Graſs-plots is ſtill plainly to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>The Park here is large, and walled about, as moſt of the Parks in <hi>Scotland</hi> are; but there is little or no Wood in it. The Earls of <hi>Mar,</hi> of the Name of <hi>Ereſkin,</hi> who claims to be Hereditary Keeper of the King's Children, and of this Caſtle, had a Houſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0141100404:132"/>
at the upper End of the Town, very finely ſituated for Proſpect, but not for Security, being too near the Caſtle; for were the Caſtle ever to ſuffer a cloſe Siege, and be vigorouſly defended, it would run a great Riſque of being demoliſhed on one Side or other; beſides, this Nearneſs to the Caſtle makes the Site more confuſed to the Eye.</p>
            <p>From a pretty little Flower-garden upon one of the Baſtions on the North-ſide of the Caſtle, we had a moſt agreeable Proſpect over the Valley, and of the Meanders, Turnings, or Reaches of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Forth,</hi> which are extremely beautiful. They are ſo ſpacious, and return ſo near themſelves with ſo regular and exact a Sweep, that, I believe, the like of it is not to be ſeen in <hi>Britain,</hi> and perhaps, not in <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpecially in ſo large a River. The <hi>Seine,</hi> indeed, between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Roan,</hi> fetches a Sweep ſomething like theſe, and ſome Miles longer, but then it is but one; whereas here are three double Reaches, which makes ſix Returns together, and each of them above three <hi>Scots</hi> Miles in Length: And as the Bows are almoſt equal for Breadth, as the Reaches are for Length, it makes the Figure complete. It is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Sight indeed, and continues from a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the great Bridge at <hi>Stirling</hi> to <hi>Alloway,</hi> the Seat of the Earls of <hi>Mar.</hi> The Form of this Winding may be conceived by the Length of the Way; for it is twenty-four Miles from <hi>Stirling</hi> to <hi>Alloway</hi> by Water, and hardly four Miles by Land.</p>
            <p>One would think theſe large Windings of the Stream would check the Tide very much; but, on the contrary, we found the Tide of Flood make up very ſtrong under <hi>Stirling-bridge,</hi> tho' it does not flow above ſeven or eight Miles farther; for the Stream grows narrow apace, and the rapid Current of all Rivers in this Country checks the Tide, when it comes into narrow Limits: The ſame is the Caſe in the <hi>Tyne</hi> at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and the <hi>Tweed</hi> at <hi>Berwick,</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0141100404:133"/>
in both which, tho' the Tide flows as ſtrong in at the Mouth of theſe Rivers as in this, yet the Navigation goes not near ſo far up.</p>
            <p>The Bridge of <hi>Stirling</hi> has only four Arches; but they are very large, and the Chanel widens conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably below it. At <hi>Alloway</hi> it is above a Mile broad, and deep enough for Ships of any Burden; ſo that the <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Merchants are certainly in the right to ſettle Warehouſes there, and ſhip off their Goods for the Eaſtern Countries.</p>
            <p>I was very curious to inquire into the Courſe of this River, as I had been before into that of the <hi>Clyde,</hi> to ſee if there was a Poſſibility of uniting their Waters for an Inland Navigation; becauſe I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the Charts and Plans of the Country brought them almoſt to meet. But when I came to ſurvey the Ground exactly, I found the Map-makers greatly miſtaken, and that they had not only given the Situation and Courſes of the Rivers wrong, but the Diſtances alſo. However, upon the whole, I ſaw plainly, that notwithſtanding ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which might obſtruct it, and cauſe the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to fetch ſome winding Turns out of the Way, yet a Canal of about 18 Miles would fairly join the Rivers, and make a clear Navigation from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to the <hi>German</hi> Sea; and that this could be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable Obſtruction; for they would not have Occaſion for above four Sluices in the whole Way, and thoſe only to head a Baſon, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle, to contain a Fluſh of Water, to puſh on the Veſſels either way, as Occaſion required.</p>
            <p>How eaſy ſuch a Work would be, and how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, not to <hi>Scotland</hi> only, but even to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Thing itſelf will explain at firſt Sight. I could enter upon particular Deſcriptions of the Work, and anſwer all the Objections raiſed from the great Quantity of Waters in the Winter, and the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0141100404:134"/>
Force and Fury of their Streams; but I have no room for it here.</p>
            <p>There is a very conſiderable Manufacture at <hi>Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> for Serges or Shalloons, which they make and dye very well; nor has the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture for Shalloons broke in ſo much upon them as it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it would. This Manufacture is a great Support to the poor People that are employed in it, who are thereby enabled to live very comfortably.</p>
            <p>The Family of <hi>Ereſkine</hi> is very conſiderable here; for beſides the Earls of <hi>Mar</hi> and <hi>Buchan,</hi> there are ſeveral Gentlemen of Quality of that Name.</p>
            <p>We had here a very fine Proſpect both Eaſt and Weſt: Eaſtward we could plainly ſee the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Hill, called <hi>Arthur</hi>'s <hi>Seat,</hi> in the Royal Park at <hi>Holy-rood-houſe</hi>; and Weſtward we could ſee <hi>Dumbarton</hi> Caſtle. To the Northward we ſaw <hi>Dumblane,</hi> and the Field of Battle, called <hi>Sheriffmuir,</hi> between it and <hi>Sterling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Buſineſs was not to the North yet; for having a Part of the Border to view, we went from <hi>Stirling</hi> to the South-eaſt, over ſome of the ſame Hills we paſſed at our coming hither, that we might leave nothing behind to oblige us to come this Way again. The Duke of <hi>Argyll</hi> has a ſmall Houſe here, which the Family call the <hi>Lowland Houſe,</hi> to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from the many Seats they are poſſeſſed of in the Highlands. This Seat belonged formerly to the Earls of <hi>Stirling.</hi> The County round it, South of the <hi>Forth,</hi> is called <hi>Stirlingſhire,</hi> or <hi>Strivelingſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stirling</hi> was one of the Boundaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <hi>Britain,</hi> as appears by the Inſcription on a Stone below the Caſtle, towards the Bridge, import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That one of the Wings of their Army kept Guard there. On the Right of the Town ſtood the noble Abbey of <hi>Cambuſkenneth.</hi> The River <hi>Carron,</hi> which I mentioned before, is famous for ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Monuments, particularly two little Hills,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0141100404:135"/>
called by the Vulgar <hi>Dunipace, i. e.</hi> Hills of Peace, and two Miles lower is a round Edifice of Stone, which, by the Deſcription, reſembles what the <hi>Romans</hi> called the <hi>Temple of Terminus.</hi> But <hi>Buchanan</hi> thinks, they were rather Monuments of ſome great Actions performed here.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Stirling</hi> we went directly to <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> a large Town, well built, with a ſtately Town-houſe, but moſt famous for the noble Palace of the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is the leaſt decayed of all the reſt; for King <hi>James</hi> VI. repaired, or rather rebuilt it; and his two Sons Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> afterwards King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> had Apartments here, which a Traveller may eaſily diſtinguiſh by the different Coats of Arms, eſpecially over thoſe called the <hi>Prince's Lodgings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Palace ſtands on a riſing Ground, which runs into the Lake, in form of an Amphitheatre, and has a Deſcent reſembling Terrace-walks. There are two Towers at each Corner of the Court, with Apartments, and a curious Fountain in the Middle, adorned with ſeveral fine Statues, from whence the Water riſes to a good Height. A noble Park alſo belongs to it.</p>
            <p>The Church of St. <hi>Michael</hi> makes a Part of this Building, and is a Wing on the Right-hand of the firſt Court, as the proper Offices make the Left. The Inner-court is very large and elegant for the Taſte of the Times. In the Middle of this is the large Fountain I have mentioned, which ſtill ſhews the Remains of ſome good Carving, and other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Here King <hi>James</hi> V. reſtored the Order of the Knights of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> as the Order of Knights of the <hi>Bath</hi> lately was in <hi>England,</hi> and erected a Throne and Stalls for them in St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Church, making
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0141100404:136"/>
it the Chapel of the Order. He was likewiſe the firſt who ordered the <hi>Thiſtle</hi> to be added to the Badge of the Order, and the Motto, <hi>viz. Nemo me impune laceſſet,</hi> which is worn about it in the Royal Arms, was of his Invention. This Prince ſeems to have been very much honoured in the World; for he wore the Badges of three Orders beſides his own; <hi>viz.</hi> That of the <hi>Garter,</hi> conferred upon him by his Uncle, the King of <hi>England</hi>; that of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> by the Emperor, then King of <hi>Spain</hi>; that of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> by the King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his Time the <hi>Green Ribband</hi> was worn by the Knights Companions of this Order; but King <hi>James</hi> VII. changed it to the <hi>Blue,</hi> like that of the Knights of the Garter in <hi>England.</hi> After the Union, Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> the Sovereign of both, to diſtinguiſh them, reſtored the Green Ribband, and intended to have called a Chapter of the Order, to bring it once more to its full Luſtre, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Death.</p>
            <p>In this Town the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> Lord Regent, was murdered with a Muſket-bullet ſhot by one <hi>Hamilton.</hi> This Earl was a natural Son of King <hi>James</hi> V. and aſpiring to the Crown, joined with the Reformers, having firſt got the Revenues of the Convents of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Pittenweem,</hi> whereof he was Abbot, or Prior, ſecured to him and his Heirs. His Ambition and Intrigues were the chief Cauſe of almoſt all the Troubles of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign. But I ſhall have Occaſion to mention him in another Place.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Linlithgow</hi> is a great Linen Manufacture, as there is at <hi>Glaſgow</hi>; and the Water of the Lake here is eſteemed ſo extraordinary for Bleaching or Whitening of Linen Cloth, that a vaſt deal of it is brought hither from other Parts of the Country for that Purpoſe. This Lake is ſituate on the North-ſide of the Town, and between it and the Palace
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0141100404:137"/>
are Terrace-walks, which are ſo beautiful, that a more delightful Place can ſcarce be ſeen.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1722. An Act paſſed for laying Two-penies <hi>Scots</hi> on every <hi>Scots</hi> Pint of Ale or Beer ſold in <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> and its Liberties, in order to repair the publick Buildings, which were run to Decay, ſuch as the Church and Town-houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſupply ſuch Parts of the Town with freſh Water, as want it; to pave and amend the Streets, and alſo the Avenues within a Mile round the Town; for diſcharging the Town-Debts, and other neceſſary Purpoſes. Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was made in theſe laudable Undertakings by virtue of this Act; but the End being not ſufficiently attained, nor likely to be, at the Expiration of the Act, theſe Duties were farther continued for 21 Years more, by an Act which paſſed in the Year 1733. which, it is not doubted, will completely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the propoſed Ends, to the great Advantage of the Town and Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forfichen,</hi> formerly the Reſidence of the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> is two Miles South-weſt from <hi>Linlithgow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near a Place called <hi>Kips,</hi> South from this Town, is an antient Chapel or Altar of great unpoliſhed Stones, leaning ſo as to ſupport one another. The Vulgar call them <hi>Arthur's Oven</hi>; but the Learned think them to be a Temple of <hi>Terminus,</hi> built by the <hi>Romans</hi>; and others ſtill there are, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture them to be a Temple of the <hi>Celts</hi> or <hi>Druids.</hi> Near this Chapel or Altar is a Circle of great Stones, and on two adjacent Hills are the Remains of old Camps, with great Heaps of Stones, and antient Graves, which ſome think <hi>Roman</hi> Works.</p>
            <p>About four Miles North from <hi>Linlithgow</hi> lies the Caſtle of <hi>Abercorn,</hi> ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Kebercurnig</hi> of <hi>Bede,</hi> where began the <hi>Roman</hi> Wall, thought to be begun by <hi>Severus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Linlithgow</hi> we turned to the Right, and following the <hi>Clyde</hi> upwards, from a little above
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0141100404:138"/>
               <hi>Hamilton,</hi> where we were before, we came into the Shire of <hi>Clydſale.</hi> This Tract has ſome Remains of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquity; for from <hi>Errick-ſtone</hi> to <hi>Mauls Mitre,</hi> which borders upon the Shire of <hi>Renfrew,</hi> are evident Footſteps of a <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſeway for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Miles together; and there is a Tradition, that another <hi>Roman</hi> Street went from <hi>Lanark</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Camp near <hi>Falkirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lanark</hi> is the Capital of this County, but is no extraordinary Town; its Bridge, however, is very remarkable. It was built at a vaſt Expence by the Inhabitants: But the violent Current of the Water rendering the keeping it in Repair too chargeable for the Town to ſupport, and making it require fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Reparations, an Act of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Parliament paſſed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1703. impowering them to collect Tolls for Pontage, in order to keep up the ſame. This Act was in Force for 19 Years, and there was ſo much Reaſon for it, and the Bridge was of ſo great Uſe to the County, that tho' the Duties expired in the Year 1722. yet the Rates were voluntarily paid for many Years; till ſome Diſputes ariſing with ſome ſelfiſh Perſons, who wanted to reap the Fruits of other Peoples Labour for nothing, an Act was paſſed, in the 10th of King <hi>George</hi> II. for enabling the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to repair and maintain ſo uſeful a Work. This Act is to continue in Force for 31 Years, and is ſo reaſonable, that it ought, and perhaps will be, perpetuated: For the Rates are only 6<hi>d.</hi> Sterling for every Coach or Chariot drawn by four or more Horſes; 2<hi>d.</hi> for every Cart or Wheel-carriage; 1<hi>d.</hi> for every Sledge or Horſe loaded or unloaded; Two-thirds of a Peny for every Ox, Cow, or Bull; One-ſixth of a Peny for every Calf, Hog, Sheep or Lamb; and the ſame for every Foot Paſſenger; who muſt be a worſe Beaſt than any I have named, to grudge it for ſo great a Convenience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0141100404:139"/>A little below this Town the River <hi>Dowglas</hi> falls into the <hi>Clyde,</hi> and gives the Name of <hi>Dowglaſdale</hi> to the Lands near it. In a dull Vale near this River ſtands a very old Caſtle, which has been the paternal Seat of the great Family of <hi>Dowglas</hi> for above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years, for which Reaſon it is ſtill kept in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair: But by the frequent Additions to the Building, it is become ſuch a wild irregular Maſs, that, at a Diſtance, it ſeems rather like a Town than a ſingle Fabrick; tho' the Apartments are very noble.</p>
            <p>The complete Hiſtory of this Family would take up a Volume by itſelf, as it actually has in a late Work, where the Heroes of the Name are fully ſet forth, and all the illuſtrious Actions they have been concerned in. I ſhall only obſerve, that there are no leſs than Seven Branches of this Family in the Peerage of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> namely, the Duke of <hi>Dowglas,</hi> who is Chief of the Name, the Duke of <hi>Queenſberry</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Morton, Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barton,</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Mordington</hi> and <hi>Forfar,</hi> the latter of whom was unhappily killed at the Fight near <hi>Dumblaine,</hi> againſt the Pretender.</p>
            <p>The Country abounds with Coals, Peat and Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; but what turns to the greateſt Profit, are the Lead-mines belonging to the Earl of <hi>Hopton</hi>; not far from which (after Rains) the Country People find Pieces of Gold, ſome of which are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Bigneſs. This is thought to be what <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> calls <hi>Crawford-Moor,</hi> where <hi>Lapis Lazuli</hi> is daily dug up with little Trouble, as I have ſaid.</p>
            <p>Here we left the laſt-mentioned wild Place on the Right, and went Weſtward into the Shire of <hi>Peebles.</hi> The firſt Town we came to of any Note was <hi>Peebles,</hi> which ſtands on the Bank of the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and is Capital of the County. The Town is ſmall, and but very indifferently built or inhabited, yet there are ſome good Houſes in it. It was formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for three Churches, three Gates, three
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0141100404:140"/>
Streets, and three Bridges, of which that over <hi>Tweed</hi> has five Arches.</p>
            <p>The Country hereabouts is very hilly; but thoſe Hills are covered with Sheep, which are a principal Part of the Eſtates of the Gentry. A great Quantity of them are ſent into <hi>England,</hi> to the great Damage of the Poor, who are thereby deprived of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of manufacturing their Wool. They uſed formerly to export it to <hi>France</hi>; but by the Act of Union, the Exportation of it was prohibited upon the ſevereſt Penalties; and to make the Gentlemen of the Southern Counties amends for this Loſs, a great Sum of Money was at that time granted them as an Equivalent, as I have mentioned before, to encourage them to ſet the Poor to work.</p>
            <p>This County of <hi>Tweedale</hi> has two remarkable Lakes in it; the one called <hi>Weſt-water Lake,</hi> abounds ſo with Eels and other Fiſh, about <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that, during a Weſt Wind, they come out in ſuch Shoals into a ſmall River which runs from the Lake, that, we were told, they are ready to overthrow the People who go in to catch them. The other is <hi>Lochgenen Lake,</hi> upon <hi>Genen-hill,</hi> which falls into <hi>Annandale</hi> from a Precipice of 250 Feet high, that many times Fiſhes are killed by the Fall of the Water.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Frazers</hi> were Anceſtors by Marriage to the Family of <hi>Tweedale</hi>; and of this Name was that great Captain, who contributed ſo much to the Victory which the <hi>Scots</hi> obtained in one Day over three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armies at <hi>Roſbin</hi> 1301. during <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi>'s Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Merlin</hi> is ſaid to be buried in the Church-yard of <hi>Drumelzier,</hi> in this County; and according to an old Prophecy, <hi>That the Kingdoms ſhould be united, when</hi> Tweed <hi>and</hi> Pauſel <hi>met at his Grave,</hi> they ſay that it happened ſo by an Inundation, when King <hi>James</hi> VI. came to the Crown of <hi>England, Anno</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0141100404:141"/>
1603. the only time, before or ſince, it ever did ſo.</p>
            <p>Some Remains of Antiquity are viſible in this County. The Place called <hi>Randal</hi>'s <hi>Trench</hi> ſeems to have been a <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and a Cauſeway leads from it half a Mile together to the Town of <hi>Lyne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this County are two very lively Monuments of the Vanity of human Glory. The firſt is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a prodigious Building (more like a Royal Palace, than the Seat of a private Nobleman) begun by the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> whoſe Head was no ſooner cut off, than his Deſign periſhed; for it has never ſince been carried on.</p>
            <p>The other is the Palace of <hi>Traquair,</hi> built and finiſhed by the late Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> for ſome Years Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a Perſon in the higheſt Poſts both of Honour and Profit in the Kingdom, who yet loſt all by the Fatality of the Times; for growing into univerſal Diſlike by his Conduct under King <hi>Charles</hi> I. he ſunk into the moſt abject Condition of human Life, even to want Bread, and to take Alms, and died in thoſe miſerable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances about a Year before the Reſtoration. The Houſe is noble, the Deſign great, and well finiſhed; but the Owner was ſoon turned out of it by his Enemies, who thought the ſparing his Life an Act of great Mercy.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> repreſents this Earl as a very mean-ſpirited Man, and one that ſuffered himſelf to be made ſo vile a Tool in other Peoples Miſchiefs, that he fell unpitied. 'Tis very remarkable, that he was deſpiſed even by the Party which he had ſerved, and but too faithfully adhered to.</p>
            <p>Here we ſaw the Ruins of the once famous Abbey of <hi>Melroſs,</hi> the Greatneſs of which may be a little gueſſed at by the vaſt Extent of its Remains. One may ſtill diſtinguiſh many noble Parts of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, particularly the great Church or Chapel, as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0141100404:142"/>
large as ſome Cathedrals, the Choir of which is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and 140 Feet in Length, beſides what may have been pulled down at the Eaſt-end; and by the Thickneſs of the Foundations there muſt have been a large and ſtrong Tower, or Steeple, in the Centre of the Church. There are likewiſe ſeveral Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Houſe itſelf; and the Court, and other Buildings are ſo viſible, that 'tis eaſy to know it was a moſt magnificent Place in its Day.</p>
            <p>Following the Courſe of the <hi>Tweed,</hi> we paſſed by abundance of antient Seats of Gentlemen, whoſe Poſſeſſions are large in this Country; ſuch as that of the Family of <hi>Dowglas,</hi> of whom one is called <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi> of <hi>Cavers,</hi> who is Hereditary Sheriff of the County; and who ſhews the Standard of the brave Lord <hi>Dowglas,</hi> who was killed at the Battle of <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburn,</hi> falſely, as the <hi>Scots</hi> ſay, called <hi>Cheviot Chaſe</hi> (which I have mentioned in <hi>Vol.</hi> III.) juſt as he had gained the Victory; as alſo the Mace of Iron he fought with.</p>
            <p>The Country, South-eaſt from <hi>Tweedale,</hi> is called <hi>Tiviotdale,</hi> or the Shire of <hi>Roxburgh.</hi> In which are ſome Footſteps of <hi>Roman</hi> Encampments, and a Military Way runs from <hi>Hounam</hi> to <hi>Tweed,</hi> called <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>Cauſeway,</hi> and vulgarly, <hi>the rugged Cauſeway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town and Caſtle of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> are both now demoliſhed. They were famous in the Hiſtory of both Nations, during their mutual Wars, when the Town was frequently taken and retaken, and in the Siege of which King <hi>James</hi> II. of <hi>Scotland</hi> was killed by the burſting of a Gun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jedburgh</hi> is a Royal Burgh, on the River <hi>Jed.</hi> It was one of thoſe Towns that ſuffered in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in 1715. and being beſide in Debt, and its Revenue ſmall to anſwer its Outgoings; and it being well ſituated for manufacturing coarſe Wool; but greatly ſuffering for want of freſh Water; and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0141100404:143"/>
its publick Buildings, Bridges, Streets, and Works, greatly out of Repair; for theſe Reaſons, and alſo to enable the Inhabitants to erect Workhouſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Manufacture aforeſaid, an Act paſſed 1720. impoſing a Duty of Two-penies <hi>Scots</hi> upon every Pint of <hi>Scots</hi> Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be vended within the ſaid Town and its Liberties; and it now reaps the good Effects of it.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> has a very great Eſtate. His Grace's Houſe, called <hi>Fleurs,</hi> has been finely embelliſhed of late Years, and is a noble Seat; and the Country about it, which was formerly wild and rugged, is now greatly impaired and cultivated, and fine Plantations of Trees and Viſta's ſurround the Houſe,</p>
            <p>From hence we came to <hi>Kelſo,</hi> a handſome Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-town upon the Bank of <hi>Tweed,</hi> which, being ſo near the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Border, and having one of the great Roads from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> lying thro' it, which is a nearer Way by far than by that thro' <hi>Berwick,</hi> is a conſiderable Thorough-fare to <hi>England.</hi> They only want a good Bridge over the <hi>Tweed</hi>; for at preſent they have only a Ferry juſt at the Town, and a good Ford thro' the River a little below it.</p>
            <p>The Country about <hi>Kelſo</hi> is very pleaſant and fruitful on both Sides the <hi>Tweed.</hi> The River here does not part <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi>; but you are upon <hi>Scots</hi> Ground for four Miles, or thereabouts, on the South-ſide of the <hi>Tweed</hi>; and the farther Weſt, the more the <hi>Tweed</hi> lies within the Limits of the Country.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Kelſo</hi> we went North, where we paſſed thro' <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> a long Valley on both Sides of the little River <hi>Lauder,</hi> from whence the Family of <hi>Maitland,</hi> firſt Earls, then Dukes, and now Earls again, took their Title.</p>
            <p>The Country is good here, and fenced with Hills on both Sides. The River <hi>Lauder</hi> runs through it, keeping its Courſe due North.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0141100404:144"/>The Town of <hi>Lauder</hi> is a Royal Burgh, the Seat of the Commiſſariot; and very pleaſantly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. 'Tis remarkable for the Execution done upon the Minions of King <hi>James</hi> III. who, headed by the Earls of <hi>Angus,</hi> took them out of the Court, and hang'd them over <hi>Lauder-bridge.</hi> The Seat of the noble Family of <hi>Maitland,</hi> Earls of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> is called <hi>Lauderfort:</hi> It is a ſtately Houſe, about the Middle of the Valley, on the River, but not large.</p>
            <p>We kept the great Road over a high Ridge of Mountains, from whence we had a plain View of <hi>Mid-Lothian.</hi> One of theſe Mountains is called <hi>Soutra-hill,</hi> and belongs to a Branch of the Family of <hi>Maitland,</hi> the elder Brother of which Houſe was a Gentleman of great Merit, and raiſed himſelf by his perſonal Accompliſhments to the higheſt Poſts in the Army. At the Battle of <hi>Treves</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> Army, under the Mareſchal <hi>de Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> was defeated by the <hi>Germans,</hi> commanded by the old Duke of <hi>Zell,</hi> he had the Misfortune to loſe one of his Hands, which he ſupplied with another of Steel, from whence he was called <hi>Handy Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> About the Time of the Union he was Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General of the Queen's Armies, Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and Governor of <hi>Fort-William</hi> and <hi>Inverlochy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could not paſs this Way to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> without going off a little to the Right, to ſee two very fine Seats. One of them is an old Abbey belonging to the Marquis of <hi>Lothian,</hi> of the antient Name of <hi>Ker,</hi> a younger Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> at <hi>Newbottle</hi>; whoſe Predeceſſor, <hi>Mark Ker,</hi> being Abbot of it, turned Proteſtant, and got it ſettled on him and his Heirs. 'Tis an old Building, but finely ſituated among the moſt agreeable Walks and Rows of Trees, all full grown, and contains one of the beſt choſen Collections of Pictures, Statues, and Buſts, in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0141100404:145"/>About a Mile from hence is the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleugh</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> without Exception the fineſt and largeſt new-built Houſe in <hi>Scotland.</hi> It was built by the late Ducheſs, Relict of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> on the Ground where the old Caſtle of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> ſtood, which was the Eſtate of the Great Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed under King <hi>James</hi> VI. by an Engine he himſelf had introduced into this Country, as I have mentioned, at <hi>Halifax,</hi> in <hi>Vol.</hi> III. He ſuffered for being acceſſory to, and acquainted with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Deſign of the Lord <hi>Darnley</hi>'s Murder.</p>
            <p>This Palace ſtands on a riſing Ground on the Edge of the River <hi>North-Eſk,</hi> from whence it overlooks the Plain, with a Majeſty like that of <hi>Windſor</hi> on the Bank of the <hi>Thames,</hi> making ſome Allowance for the Difference of the two Rivers. The Park is very large, and beautified with Water-works, <hi>Jets d' Eau,</hi> and a Canal, the expenſive Work of the late Ducheſs, and the preſent Duke.</p>
            <p>The Inſide of this magnificent Palace is anſwerable to the Grandeur of the Family, being very richly furniſhed, and adorned with many fine Paintings, eſpecially of the Ladies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and ſome Royal Originals.</p>
            <p>Juſt beyond the Park is <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> a pretty large Market-town, and the more conſiderable for being ſo near <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; for great Quantities of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions are brought hither from the Southern Countries, which are ſold here, and afterwards ſent to that City.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Letter with the following Inſcription on the Tombſtone of one <hi>Margaret Scott,</hi> who died in the Town of <hi>Dalkeith February</hi> 9. 1738.<q>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM now to enter the true and real <hi>Caledonia</hi>; for that Part of the Country on the North of the Firth of <hi>Forth</hi> is alone called by that Name, and was antiently known by no other.</p>
            <p>I croſſed the River at <hi>Queensferry,</hi> ſeven Miles Weſt of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> into the Shire of <hi>Fife</hi>; and as the moſt conſiderable Places in this County are on the Sea-ſide, or near it, I directed my Journey Eaſt along the Coaſt. The firſt Place we came to was the Burgh of <hi>Innerkeithin,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient walled Town, with a ſpacious Harbour opening from the Eaſt into the River, which has been lately
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0141100404:148"/>
much neglected for want of Trade. The Town however is large, and ſtill populous.</p>
            <p>I can't paſs over a tragical Story, which happened in this Town in the Reign of the late Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> The Maſter of <hi>Burleigh</hi> (ſo the eldeſt Son of a Lord or Viſcount is called, while the Father is living) fell in Love with a young Woman in his Father's Family, but could not prevail with her either to marry him, or to ſacrifice her Virtue to him; which being known, ſhe was ſent away, and he perſuaded to travel. However, before his Departure, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhe ſhould be his Wife at his Return; and if any one elſe ſhould marry her in his Abſence, he would murder him. This paſſed without much Notice, and the young Woman was ſoon after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a School-maſter in this Town.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman returned, and underſtanding who was her Huſband, went to his Houſe at Noon-day, pull'd out a Piſtol, and ſhot him dead on the Spot, making his Eſcape unmoleſted.</p>
            <p>But a Proclamation being afterwards iſſued, with a Reward of 200<hi>l.</hi> for apprehending him, he was at laſt taken, and tried at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> by the Lords of the Juſticiary, and condemned to have his Head cut off. Great Interceſſion was made to the Queen for his Pardon, which proving ineffectual, he found means to make his Eſcape out of the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> diſguiſed in his Siſter's Cloaths, the Night before he was to have been executed.</p>
            <p>After that, he appeared in the late Rebellion, and was in the Battle of <hi>Dumblane,</hi> or <hi>Sheriffmuir,</hi> but eſcaped again with his Life, tho' his Eſtate, which was but ſmall, was forfeited among the reſt.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Innerkeithin,</hi> a little within the Land, ſtands the antient Town of <hi>Dumfermling,</hi> which is now in a very ruinous State. For, 1. Here is a decayed Monaſtery, which before the Reformation was very large, but then demoliſhed, ſaving a Part, which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0141100404:149"/>
was turned into a Parochial Church; and even that is now decayed, and with it the Monuments of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kings and Queens of <hi>Scotland</hi>; particularly, that of <hi>Malcolm</hi> III. who founded the Monaſtery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is a decayed Court, or Royal Palace, of the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi>; but by whom built, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Almoſt all King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth's Children were born in it, particularly King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> afterwards Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; and his Queen made this Place her particular Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and had it ſettled upon her as her Jointure: Here ſhe built herſelf an Apartment over the Arch of the great Gate for her particular Retirement, having a Gallery reaching from it to the Royal Lodgings. All is now ruinous.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is a decayed Town, the natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Decay of the Palace. The Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment King <hi>Charles</hi> II. met with here, from the Covenanters, was ſufficient to make him take a Diſguſt to the Place.</p>
            <p>The Church has ſtill a venerable Face, and at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeems a mighty Pile, the Building being once vaſtly large. What is left appears too heavy for the preſent Dimenſions. The Church itſelf is ſaid to be as long as the Cathedral of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> deſigned by the Model of that at <hi>Glaſgow</hi>; but I rather think, that at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> was deſigned by the Model of this at <hi>Dumfermling</hi>; for it ſeems the moſt antient.</p>
            <p>The People are poor, but would be poorer, if they had not the Manufacture of Linen for their Support, the Diaper and better Sort of Linen-trade being carried on here, and in the neighbouring Towns, with more Hands than ordinary. The Marquis of <hi>Tweedale</hi> has a great Eſtate in theſe Parts, and is hereditary Chamberlain or Keeper of the Royal Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Rocking Stone, near <hi>Balvaird</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> was a remarkable Curioſity. It was broken by <hi>Oliver</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0141100404:150"/>
               <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Soldiers, and then it was diſcovered, that its Motion was performed by an egg-ſhaped Extube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Middle of the under Surface of the upper Stone, which was inſerted in a Cavity in the Surface of the lower Stone. As the lower Stone was flat, the upper was globular; and not only a juſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the Motion was calculated from the Weight of the Stone, and the Wideneſs of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as well as the oval Figure of the inſerted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence; but the vaſt Bulk of the upper Stone ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely conceal'd the Mechaniſm of the Motion; and, the better ſtill to impoſe on the Vulgar, there were two or three ſurrounding flat Stones, tho' that only in the Middle was concerned in the Feat. By this pretended Miracle they condemn'd of Perjury, or acquitted, as their Intereſt or Affection led them; and often brought Criminals to confeſs what could be no other way extorted from them.</p>
            <p>From turning Eaſt, we ſaw many Seats of private Gentlemen, and ſome of Noblemen, particularly one belonging to the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> at <hi>Aberdour</hi>; which fronts the <hi>Firth</hi> to the South, and the Grounds belonging to it reach down to the Shore.</p>
            <p>From this Part of the <hi>Firth,</hi> to the Mouth of <hi>Innerkeithin</hi> Harbour, is a very good Road for Ships, the Water being deep, and the Ground good; but the Weſtern Part, which they call <hi>St. Margaret's Bay,</hi> is a ſteep Shore and rocky, there being 20 Fathom Water within a Ship's Length of the Rocks. So that if a South-eaſt Wind blows hard, it may be dangerous riding in it: But this Wind blows ſo ſeldom, that the Ships often venture it.</p>
            <p>He that will view the County of <hi>Fife,</hi> which is wedg'd in by the <hi>Forth</hi> and the <hi>Tay,</hi> and ſhoots out far into the Eaſt, muſt, as I ſaid before, go round the Coaſt; and yet there are four or five Places of Note in the Middle of the County, which are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all the reſt, and muſt not be omitted: <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſs,</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0141100404:151"/>
               <hi>Leſsly, Falkland, Melvil, Balgony,</hi> and <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par</hi>; the laſt a Town, the others great Houſes, and one, <hi>viz. Falkland,</hi> a Royal Palace, and once the moſt in Requeſt of all the Royal Houſes in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader will be ſurpriſed to hear of ſuch Numbers of Palaces; but however mean our Thoughts may be of the <hi>Scots</hi> Court in antient Times, their Kings had more fine Palaces than moſt Princes in <hi>Europe</hi>; for in the Time of King <hi>James</hi> IV. they had all in good Repair and in Uſe, the ſeveral Royal Palaces of <hi>Holy-rood-houſe,</hi> and the Caſtle at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Royal Palace in the Caſtle at <hi>Sterling, Linlithgow, Dumfermling, Falkland, Scone,</hi> the Caſtles of <hi>Dumbarton, Blackneſs,</hi> and <hi>Inverneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides leſſer Seats and Hunting-houſes, of which King <hi>James</hi> V. had ſeveral; and the ſeveral Palaces of Earl <hi>Morton</hi> and others, which were forfeited into the King's Hands.</p>
            <p>The South Coaſt of the County of <hi>Fife</hi> abounds with Towns; and the following Thirteen are Royal Burghs, <hi>viz. Innerkeithin, Bruntiſland, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, Kirkaldy, Dyſart, Pittenweem, Anſtruther Weſter, Anſtruther Eaſter, Kilrinny, Crail, St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> all on the Coaſt, <hi>Dumfermling</hi> and <hi>Cowpar</hi> in the midſt of the County. And it contains alſo theſe other Towns of Note; <hi>viz. Toryburn, Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi> the two <hi>Weemys's, Levinſmouth, Ely, St. Monan's,</hi> and <hi>Newburg on the Tay:</hi> And it has in it four Preſbyteries; <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Cowpar, St. Andrews, Kirkaldy</hi> and <hi>Dumfermling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Shire itſelf takes its Name from <hi>Fyfus,</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Duffus,</hi> to whom it was granted by King <hi>Kenneth</hi> II. for his Valour againſt the <hi>Picts,</hi> about the Year 840. His Poſterity were firſt called Thanes of <hi>Fife,</hi> and afterwards Earls by <hi>Malcolm</hi> II. about the Year 1057. and endow'd with greater
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0141100404:152"/>
Privileges than any other Earls of the Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their extraordinary Services: A famous Monument of which, was that called <hi>Clan Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duff's Croſs,</hi> on the publick Road near <hi>Abernethy,</hi> to which if any within the 9th Degree to the great <hi>Macduff,</hi> who was the chief Inſtrument of ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tyrant <hi>Macbeth,</hi> ſhould have recourſe in caſe of Manſlaughter, he was to be pardon'd on paying a ſmall Number of Cattle. This Monument had an Inſcription importing thoſe Privileges, now worn out, and was in ſuch antiquated Terms, mixed with Macaronick, or half <hi>Latin</hi> Words, that few Men now living would have been able to make it out.</p>
            <p>From this <hi>Macduff</hi> the Families of <hi>Dowglas, Weemys,</hi> and the Clan <hi>Chattau,</hi> are ſaid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. The Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> is hereditary Sheriff of <hi>Fife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſeen <hi>Aberdour,</hi> I took a Turn, at a Friend's Invitation, to <hi>Leſsly</hi>; but by the Way ſtopt at <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſs,</hi> where we had a View of two Things worth noting. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The famous Lake or Lough, called <hi>Lough Leven,</hi> in an Iſland of which ſtands the Caſtle, where Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> commonly known in <hi>England</hi> by the Name of Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the firſt Reformers, being firſt compelled to quit her Favourite <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and afterwards her Crown; but from which ſhe found means to make her Eſcape, tho', as it prov'd, <hi>Out of the Frying-pan into the Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lough itſelf is worth ſeeing; 'tis very large, being above 10 Miles in Circumference, in ſome Places deep, and famous for Fiſh. Formerly it had good Salmon, but now chiefly Trouts, Perch, Pikes, and other ſmall Fry; out of it flows the River <hi>Leven,</hi> which runs from thence to <hi>Leſsly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the Weſt-end of the Lake, (the Gardens reaching down to the very Water's Edge) ſtands the moſt beautiful and regular Piece of Architecture

(for a private Gentleman's Seat) in all <hi>Scotland</hi>; I mean the Houſe of <hi>Kinroſs,</hi> belonging to Sir <hi>John Hope Bruce,</hi> Bart. The Town, which has a very good Market and a Street tolerably well built, lies at a little Diſtance from the Houſe, ſo as not to obtrude upon its Privacy, and yet ſo as to be ready to wait upon its Call. 'Tis all Beauty; the Stone is white and fine, the Order regular, the Contrivance elegant, the Workmanſhip exquiſite. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Lines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a Compliment on his Friend's Poetry, are here literally true.

                  <l>Corinthian <hi>fills the upper Space;</hi>

                  <l>
                     <hi>So all below is</hi> Strength, <hi>and all above is</hi> Grace.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Bruce,</hi> the Surveyor-General of the Works, the <hi>Wren</hi> of <hi>North Britain,</hi> was the Founder, as well as Architect, of this Houſe. That Gentleman has left many noble Monuments of his admirable Skill and Taſte in thoſe Parts; ſuch as the Palace of <hi>Holy-rood</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; the Houſe of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and this at <hi>Kinroſs,</hi> beſides ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>The Situation of this Houſe of <hi>Kinroſs</hi> would be diſliked by ſome for its being ſo very near the Water, inſomuch that ſometimes, when the Lake is ſwelled by Winter Rains, and melted Snows, it reaches to the very Gardens; but as the Country round is dry, free from ſtagnated Boggs, and unhealthy Marſhes, this is of very little Inconvenience, if any. Sir <hi>William</hi> planted Numbers of Fir-trees upon the Land round his Houſe, which the preſent Poſſeſſor, Sir <hi>John Hope Bruce,</hi> is as careful to improve as his Grandfather was to plant. Poſterity will find the Advantage of this Taſte, which, if it ſpreads as it has begun, will in time make <hi>Scotland</hi> a ſecond <hi>Norway</hi> for Fir; for the Lowlands, as well as the Highlands, will be overſpread with Timber.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0141100404:154"/>From <hi>Kinroſs</hi> I came to <hi>Leſsly,</hi> where I had a full View of the Palace of the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> built in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. by the ſaid Sir <hi>William Bruce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it was King <hi>James</hi> II. when Duke of <hi>York,</hi> lodged, moſt part of the Time, when he was obliged by his Brother to retire into <hi>Scotland</hi>; and his Apartments are ſtill called the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Lodgings.</p>
            <p>The Magnificence of the Inſide of this Houſe is unuſually great; but what is very particular, is the long Gallery, which is the full Length of one Side of the Building, and is filled with Paintings, but eſpecially (as that is at <hi>Drumlanrig</hi>) of the great Anceſtors of the Houſe of <hi>Rothes,</hi> or <hi>Leſsly,</hi> at full Lengths, and in their Robes of Office.</p>
            <p>The Rooms of State at <hi>Kinroſs</hi> are well ſupply'd with very fine and valuable Pictures, many of which are of Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but moſt, if not all the full Lengths in this Gallery of <hi>Rothes,</hi> are of the Family, and the immediate Anceſtors, of the preſent Earl, moſt of them having been Peers, and poſſeſſed of the greateſt Places of Truſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the Year 1320. to 1725. ſo that you may imagine there may well be enough to furniſh a Gallery.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Houſe is magnificent, I cannot ſay the Situation of it is ſo advantageous as that of ſome other Seats; for it has no excellent Proſpect from the grand Town, tho' it ſtands on the Banks of the <hi>Leven</hi> juſt where another ſmaller River joins it.</p>
            <p>The Park on the South-ſide is very beautiful, ſix Miles in Circumference, walled round and diverſified with little Woods of Fir-trees, which have Viſtas reaching thro' them up to the Houſe. The Gardens are at the Eaſt-end of the Houſe, well deſigned and planted, extending to the Angle where the two Rivers meet; ſo that they are watered on the North and Eaſt-ſide, and on the South are parted
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0141100404:155"/>
with a Wall from the Park, the Weſt-end of them beginning from the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Leſsly</hi> (ſeated at a ſmall Diſtance Weſt from the Houſe, or a little North-weſt) has a good Market, but is, in no other reſpect, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The Houſe aforeſaid is the principal Glory of the Place.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Leſsly,</hi> we turn'd South to the Coaſt, and came to <hi>Bruntiſland,</hi> ſituated in the middle of the North-ſide of the River <hi>Forth,</hi> juſt oppoſite to <hi>Leith</hi>; ſo that we have from hence a fair Proſpect as well of the Road of <hi>Leith,</hi> as of the City and Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Here is a very commodious Harbour, which has no Bar, but enters, as if it had been made by Hand, into the Centre of the Town; ſo that the Ships lie with their broad Sides to the very Houſes; and it is the common Port of Safety to all Ships that happen to be forced up the Firth by Storms or contrary Winds: And Ships trading on this Coaſt frequently winter here. The Water is commonly 18, and at Spring-tides, 26 Feet deep within the Harbour; ſo that it is capable of receiving and careening the largeſt Men of War. The Town is adorned alſo with a beautiful Church, and has a large Town-houſe and Gaol. But the Harbour having ſuffered much by Time, and by Storms; and the Church, Town-houſe and Gaol, becoming ruinous, an Act paſſed <hi>Anno</hi> 1719. for laying a Duty of Two-penies <hi>Scots</hi> upon every <hi>Scots</hi> Pint of Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſold within the Town and Liberties, for increaſing the Revenues, reſtoring the Harbour, and repairing the publick Structures above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>Here is a Manufacture of Linen, as there is upon all the Coaſt of <hi>Fife,</hi> and eſpecially for Green-cloth, as it is called, which has been ſeveral Years in great Demand in <hi>England</hi> for Printing or Painting, in the room of Calicoes, which are prohibited there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0141100404:156"/>Next to <hi>Bruntiſland,</hi> upon the ſame Coaſt, is <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> noted for its Thread Manufacture, which the Women chiefly carry on; the Men being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Seamen upon all this Coaſt, as high as the <hi>Queen's-Ferry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Numbers of Porpoiſes are ſeen almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in this Firth, which the Men make a Practice of ſhooting, and then bring on Shore, and boil their Fat into Train Oil, as they do Whales, and ſeveral other great Fiſh, which they ſometimes meet with thereabout. But the <hi>Firth</hi> affords a much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Fiſhing-trade lower down; of which in its Place.</p>
            <p>The Ferry from <hi>Leith</hi> to the Shore of <hi>Fife,</hi> is fixed in <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> which is of conſiderable Advantage to it; tho' ſometimes the Boats by Streſs of Weather, are driven into <hi>Bruntiſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eaſt of this Town is <hi>Kirkcaldy,</hi> a larger, more populous, and better-built Town than the other, and indeed, than any on this Coaſt. It conſiſts chiefly of one Street running along the Shore, from Eaſt to Weſt, a full Mile, very well built. It has ſome conſiderable Merchants in it, in the moſt extenſive Senſe of the Word, beſides others that deal very largely in Corn, exporting great Quantities of it both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> Others again trade in Linen to <hi>England,</hi> who in Return bring back all needful Supplies of foreign Manufactures.</p>
            <p>Here are ſeveral Coal-pits, not only in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, but even cloſe to the very Sea, at the Weſt-end of the Town, and where, one would think, the Tide ſhould make it impoſſible to work them. At the Eaſt-end of the Town is a convenient Yard for building and repairing of Ships, and farther on, ſeveral Salt-pans for boiling and making Salt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dyſert</hi> boaſts, as I ſaid, of being a Royal Burgh; but notwithſtanding it is a very decaying Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the only Support of it is, that the Lord
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0141100404:157"/>
               <hi>Dyſert,</hi> the Landlord, has a good Salt-work here, and in the Lands adjoining an excellent Vein of <hi>Scotch</hi> Coal; both which are eaſily put on Ship-board at a ſmall Wharf adjoining. This, I think, is the whole Trade of the Town, except what ariſes from a few Nail-makers and Hard-ware Workers.</p>
            <p>I take the Decay of moſt of theſe Sea-port Towns, which 'tis evident have made a much better Figure in former Times, to be owing to the removing of the Court and Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> which has been doing ever ſince the Junction of the Kingdoms under the ſame Prince in <hi>James</hi> I. and VI. and more completely by the Union. Their Sea-port Towns had, before, a Trade; when their Court was magnificent; when their Nobility built fine Houſes, and lived in them. They then exported Goods infinitely more in Value, than what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and therefore the Balance was evidently on their Side; whereas, now, the Union has open'd a Door to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures, and ſuppreſſed many of the <hi>Scots</hi>; has prohibited their Wool going abroad, and yet ſcarcely takes it off at home. If the Cattle are ſent to <hi>England,</hi> the Money is too generally ſpent there likewiſe. The Troops raiſed here are in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service, and <hi>Scotland</hi> receives no Premium for the Levies, which ſhe might have done, had they been ſent abroad, as the <hi>Swiſs</hi> and other Nations do at this time.</p>
            <p>But the Benefits that will attend its principal Ports on the Repairs of their Harbour, and publick Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the many Acts already paſſed, and every Seſſion of Parliament paſſing, by the Two-penies <hi>Scots</hi> levied for thoſe Purpoſes, will in time, very probably, turn the Scale in favour of the Union, and increaſe the Trade of this Part of the United Kingdom, as by virtue of that Act it ſtands on the ſame foot of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage with <hi>England,</hi> and has ſo many good Ports, to receive Shipping, and carry on a Commerce with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0141100404:158"/>
foreign Parts, as well as Coaſtwiſe to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Of this the Towns of <hi>Glaſgow, Dundee, Dumfries, Irvin, Dunbar, Pittenweem, Montroſe, Inverneſs, Elgin, Aberbrothock, Bruntiſland, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nark, Linlithgow,</hi> &amp;c. will bear Teſtimony, as I have and ſhall obſerve in their proper Places. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis pity but <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould find its Account in this reſpect, in general; for it muſt be own'd, as I have in part obſerved before, that it has a plentiful Product for Exportation; and were the Iſſue of that Product returned and conſumed at home, it muſt neceſſarily grow rich and flouriſh.</p>
            <p>To take only a ſhort View of the Commodities it exports into foreign Countries, <hi>England</hi> included; for I am now conſidering <hi>Scotland</hi> as if not united:<list>
                  <item>Carried to <hi>England</hi>; Corn, Black Cattle, Sheep, Wool; Linen of ſeveral Sorts; ſome Woolen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, Stockens in particular.</item>
                  <item>To <hi>Holland, Bremen,</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh</hi>; Corn, Lead, Salt, Coal, barrell'd Pork, and Salmon.</item>
                  <item>Note, The <hi>Dutch</hi> buy the barrell'd Pork from <hi>Aberdeen</hi> for Victualling their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships, it being much better cured than that from any other Country.</item>

                  <item>To <hi>Sweden, Dantzick,</hi> and <hi>Riga</hi>; Salt, Woolen Manufactures of <hi>Sterling</hi> and <hi>Aberdeen.</hi>

                  <item>For all theſe Exportations the Returns are, or at leaſt were, before the Union;</item>
                  <item>From <hi>England</hi>; Pewter, Block-tin, Wrought Iron, Glaſs Ware, Sugars, Tobacco, Drugs and Dyers Stuffs.</item>

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0141100404:159"/>All the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woolen and Silk Manufactures were prohibited upon the ſevereſt Penalties; ſo that the Returns from <hi>England</hi> in Goods were very ſmall; the grand Return from thence was in Specie: And 'tis known, that above an Hundred Thouſand Pounds was paid into <hi>Scotland</hi> every Year for Cattle only.</item>
                  <item>From <hi>Holland</hi>; ſome fine Linens; but not much, becauſe of their own. Lace, and fine Threads, Gimp, Incle, <hi>&amp;c. Eaſt-India</hi> Goods, Linſeed, and Lint, or Flax, Linſeed-oil, Train-oil, and Whalebone.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe Sorts of Goods are returned into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but the Quantities are very ſmall: The chief Articles, to ſum up all in a little, are,</p>
            <p>From <hi>England,</hi> Sugar and Tobacco; from <hi>France,</hi> Wine and Brandy; from the Eaſt Country, Naval Stores; from <hi>Sweden,</hi> Iron and Copper; from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> Deals and Timber; from <hi>Holland,</hi> Lint and Linſeed.</p>
            <p>Now theſe put together, if I am rightly informed, do not balance the Lead, Coal, and Salt, which they export every Year: So that the Balance of Trade muſt ſtand greatly to the Credit of the <hi>Scots</hi> Account, which would be all returned into <hi>Scotland</hi> in <hi>Specie</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0141100404:160"/>
every Year, if there was not a neighbouring Gulph, into which it is all ſunk. And what a Figure would ſuch an Advantage of running Caſh be able to make?</p>
            <p>I have already touched upon the Advantages, that will probably accrue to <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Method they have fallen upon of augmenting and repairing their Ports and Harbours, by virtue of the Two-penies Tax; and ſome will further add, to balance the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages they lie under from the Union, that it is now eſtabliſh'd in a laſting Tranquillity; and an End put to thoſe Wars that uſed to lay waſte the Borders of both Nations; that this will give En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Improvement of the Land, and conſequently of raiſing the Value of Eſtates; that the Taxes are eaſy and aſcertained; that the Charges of defending the Country both Abroad and at Home lie upon <hi>England</hi>; and the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pours in Wealth upon her. And all this is true; but, is it not Pity, for all that, that her own Nobility ſhould not, like true Patriots, lend a helping Hand to the riſing Advantage of their own Country, and ſpend ſome of the large Sums they get in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in erecting Manufactures, employing the Poor, and propagating the Trade at Home, which they may ſee plainly has made their united Neighbours of <hi>England</hi> ſo much exceed them?</p>
            <p>But to return to our Travels: We came next to a Village called the <hi>Weſter-Wemys,</hi> belonging to the Earl of <hi>Wemys,</hi> whoſe Houſe ſtands a little farther Eaſt, on the Top of a high Cliff, with its Front looking down upon the Sea. At the Weſt-end of this Cliff, is a ſmall Plain, once a Bowling-green, where the late Earl, being Admiral, had ſome ſmall Field-pieces planted to anſwer Salutes. Behind the Houſe is a ſmall and irregular Court-yard, with two Wings of Building, being Offices to the Houſe on one Side, and Stables on the other. Gardens there are none, only a large well-planted Orchard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0141100404:161"/>
which and the Houſe, the Road goes on to <hi>Eaſter-Wemys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence you come to another Village, called <hi>Buckhaven,</hi> inhabited by Fiſhermen, who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd wholly in catching freſh Fiſh every Day in the <hi>Firth,</hi> and carrying them to <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Markets. The Buildings are but a miſerable Row of Cottages; yet there is ſcarce a poor Man in it; but they are in general ſo very clowniſh, that to <hi>be of the College of</hi> Buckhaven, is become a Proverb.</p>
            <p>Here we ſaw the Shore of the Sea covered with Shrimps, like a thin Snow; and as you rode among them, they would riſe like a kind of Duſt, and hop like Graſhoppers, being ſcared by the Footing of the Horſe.</p>
            <p>The Fiſhermen of this Town have a great many Boats of all Sizes, which lie upon the Beach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigged, ready to be fitted out every Year for the Herring Seaſon, in which they have a very great Share.</p>
            <p>Beyond this is the <hi>Ely,</hi> a little Town, but a very ſafe and good Harbour, firmly built of Stone, almoſt like the <hi>Cobb</hi> at <hi>Lime,</hi> tho' not projecting into the Sea ſo much as that. It ſtands a little on the Weſt-ſide of the Mouth of the <hi>Leven</hi>; the Salmon of which River are eſteemed the beſt in this Part of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Town the Earl of <hi>Wemys</hi> brings his Coal, which he digs about two Miles off, on the Banks of the River <hi>Leven</hi>; as alſo what little Salt he can make. The Coal-works are greatly prejudiced by the breaking in of the Water, notwithſtanding the immenſe Charges they have been at to prevent that Inconvenience.</p>
            <p>The People, who work in the Coal Mines in this Country, partly from their Poverty and hard Labour, and partly from the black Hue which they get from the Coal, make ſuch a frightful Appearance,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0141100404:162"/>
that their own Countryman <hi>Drumond</hi> of <hi>Hawthornden,</hi> in his famous Macaronick Poem, called <hi>Polemo-Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> thus deſcribes them:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Coale-hewers</hi> Nigri, <hi>Girnantes more</hi> Divelli.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we have ſeveral ſmall Towns on the Coaſt, as <hi>Criel</hi> or <hi>Crail, Anſtruther</hi> or <hi>Anſter,</hi> as 'tis uſually called, alſo the Port of <hi>Pittenweem</hi>; theſe are all Royal Burghs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pittenweem</hi> is a Port and Harbour very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſituated near the Mouth of the <hi>Forth,</hi> in the Shire of <hi>Fife</hi>; and great Quantities of Herring, Cod, and other Fiſh, are taken here. But it has had two great Difficulties to encounter with; that is to ſay, the low Situation of the Town, cloſe on the Harbour, by which means the Inhabitants were at a great and conſtant Expence beyond their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to maintain a Pier, and other Works, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend both the Shipping and its People: The other, that the Entrance was very narrow and ſtrait, and ſeveral Rocks lay in the Way of the Shipping, which was a great Hindrance to its Trade and Commerce. But in the Year 1719. an Act paſſed for laying a Duty of Two-penies <hi>Scots</hi> upon every <hi>Scots</hi> Pint of Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſold within the Town and its Liberties, for remedying theſe Inconveniences.</p>
            <p>Over-againſt this Shore, and in the Mouth of the <hi>Forth,</hi> oppoſite to the Iſle of the <hi>Baſs,</hi> lies the Iſle of <hi>May,</hi> known to Mariners by a Light-houſe upon it. The only conſtant Inhabitant is ſaid to be the Man maintained there by the Government to take care of the Fire in the Light-houſe. It was famous in former Times for barren Women going to St. <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Shrine there.</p>
            <p>Here the <hi>French</hi> Fleet lay with ſome Aſſurance, with the <hi>Pretender</hi> on board, in 1708. when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Squadron approaching, the Four o'clock Gun gave the Alarm; upon which they immediately
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0141100404:163"/>
weighed, got under Sail, and made the beſt of their Way, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> purſuing in vain.</p>
            <p>The Shore of the <hi>Firth</hi> or <hi>Frith</hi> ends here, and the <hi>Aeſtuarium</hi> or Mouth opening, the Land of <hi>Fife</hi> falls off to the North, making a Promontory of Land, which the Seamen call <hi>Fifeneſs,</hi> looking Eaſt on the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, after which the Coaſt bends away North, and the firſt Town you come to is <hi>St. Andrew</hi>'s, an antient, and once flouriſhing City, the Metropolis of all <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Seat of the firſt Univerſity, and before the Revolution an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's See.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable for a fine Situation, ſurrounded with extenſive Corn-fields abounding in excellent Wheat and Barley, and the pleaſant Downs, called the <hi>Links,</hi> lying on the Sea-ſide towards the North. The famous Phyſician <hi>Cardan</hi> eſteemed it the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt Town he ever lived in, having Occaſion to experience it ſome Months, when he came over from <hi>Italy,</hi> at the Requeſt of the Pope, to preſcribe to Archbiſhop <hi>John Hamilton,</hi> whom he recovered of a Conſumption. And twenty Years before, it had the Approbation of the moſt eminent Phyſicians of the Country, when a Houſe was fitted up here for the Reception of <hi>Magdalen,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who married <hi>James</hi> V. King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in 1537. but that Lady died ſhortly after her Arrival at <hi>Holy-rood-houſe</hi> in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and never reached <hi>St. Andrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of old conſiſted of four large Streets lying from Eaſt to Weſt, almoſt parallel to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The Northermoſt of the four, called <hi>Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſtreet,</hi> tho' formerly the principal, is now totally ruined, not ſo much as one Houſe remaining. The other three by their Regularity do not ſeem to have been a fortuitous Concourſe of Houſes, as moſt of the other Towns of this Country do; all of them terminating Eaſtward at the Cathedral, which look
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0141100404:164"/>
upon each other, and ſeem to lament their decaying Condition. For tho' the Town was heretofore about two Miles in Circumference, there remain now hardly 1000 Houſes; and of thoſe near 200 are become ruinous, and not habitable. The Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Inhabitants ſtill amount to above 4000, but many of them have nothing to do; there being neither Trade nor Manufactures in the Place, tho' at the ſame time it has a Harbour, but capable only of ſmall Veſſels. Near the Town is plenty of Free-ſtone, of which all the Houſes are built.</p>
            <p>Before the Reformation, this City was crouded both on account of Trade and Religion, Pilgrims coming hither in great Numbers to viſit the Relicks of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> ſaid to be brought over by St. <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> about the End of the fourth Century, from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> where that Apoſtle ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Here were three religious Houſes, a <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan, Dominican,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Priory, the laſt founded by <hi>Robert,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> who died 1139. and was eſtabliſhed upon ſome of the Revenues formerly belonging to the antient <hi>Culdees</hi> of this Place. <hi>James Stewart,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was, in his younger Days, Prior of it. This Monaſtery was more like the magnificent Palace of a Prince, than a Convent of Monks profeſſing Poverty, as appears ſtill by its Ruins, and particularly by the Wall that encompaſſed it of fine hewn Stone, with many Battlements and Turrets.</p>
            <p>Here is now only one Pariſh Church, that of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> remaining; but there are two others, which are rather Chapels, one to <hi>St. Salvator's</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; of which, however, no Uſe is made, it having no Endowment, and the Provoſt of that College being often a Layman, even in a Preſbyterian Senſe. The other is the Chapel belonging to <hi>St. Leonard's</hi> College, the Provoſt whereof muſt be a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0141100404:165"/>The Church of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> is an antient and ſtately Edifice built with fine Free-ſtone in form of a Croſs, and has at the Weſt-end a handſome Spire in good Repair. In it is a fine Monument of Archbiſhop <hi>Sharpe,</hi> who was aſſaſſinated upon a Moor, as he was coming Home in his Coach: It was erected by the Archbiſhop's Son, Sir <hi>William Sharpe,</hi> Bart. who to ſecure it from the Fate he feared it might be liable to, mortified 6000 Merks to the City of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> to keep it in conſtant Repair; which has had its intended Effect; for the Magiſtrates are very careful of it, and would be very ſevere upon any who ſhould attempt to deface it.</p>
            <p>On the North-ſide of the Town was the old Caſtle, of which now nothing is remaining but the Walls, built by <hi>Roger,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> who died 1202. being the ſecond Son of <hi>Robert Beaumont,</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and Chancellor of <hi>Scotland.</hi> It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by Cardinal <hi>Bethune,</hi> and Archbp. <hi>Hamilton</hi>; the former of whom procured <hi>George Wiſhart</hi> to be burnt here in the Parade, while from his Window he glutted his Eyes with ſo horrid a Spectacle; but was himſelf afterwards aſſaſſinated, 1546. in the ſame Place; to revenge whoſe Death, the Queen Regent permitted it to be attacked by the <hi>French,</hi> from whom it ſuffered greatly. But at the Reformation it ſuffered more, and its Ruin has been completed ſince the Revolution.</p>
            <p>To the Eaſt of the Caſtle are the Ruins of the ſtately Cathedral founded by Biſhop <hi>Arnold,</hi> who died 1163. and finiſhed by Biſhop <hi>Lambertoun,</hi> who died 1328. It was in Length from Eaſt to Weſt 370 Feet, and the Croſs from South to North 180; its Breadth 65, and its Heighth 100 Feet; tho' ſome draw another kind of Ichnography, and make it ſeven Feet longer, and two broader, than <hi>St. Peter's</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; and for the Height, as well as the Beauty of its Pillars, and the Symmetry and Proportion of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0141100404:166"/>
the Whole, it was one of the beſt <hi>Gothick</hi> Structures in the World.</p>
            <p>It was ſometimes called <hi>Kill-ri-mont,</hi> from the Church built by <hi>Herguſt</hi> King of the <hi>Picts</hi> in the fourth Century; but the Name of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> has prevailed for many Ages. The Cathedral was near demoliſhed at the Reformation; but was repaired, in ſome meaſure, by the ſucceeding Archbiſhops; but ſince the Revolution it has been intirely in Ruins, as we now ſee it.</p>
            <p>Near the Ruins of the Cathedral are ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Walls of the moſt antient Chapel of <hi>St. Rule,</hi> with the great ſquare Spire ſtill very intire. It is in Height 105 Feet, and made of ſuch large and durable Stones, that tho' it was built ſo many Ages ago, yet ſo little has it ſuffered by the Injuries of the Weather, that a ſmall Sum would ſave it from falling for many Ages to come: And as this is probably one of the moſt antient Monuments of Chriſtianity in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> it is Pity it ſhould go to Ruin for want of a ſuitable Reparation. This beſides would be the moſt proper Chapel and Chapter-houſe for the noble Knights of the moſt antient Order of the Thiſtle, ſince under the Patronage of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Andrew</hi> (whoſe Relicks were preſerved at this Place) that Order of Knighthood had its Riſe and Foundation; and by King <hi>James</hi> VII's Letters Patents reviving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring this noble Order, which were dated at <hi>Windſor</hi> the 26th of <hi>May</hi> 1687. it appears the Knights of the <hi>Thiſtle,</hi> or St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> formerly held their Chapters in the great Church of <hi>St. Andrews</hi>; which being demoliſhed, his ſaid Majeſty ordered them for the future, to be kept at the Chapel Royal of <hi>Holy-rood-houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This City is famous particularly for its Univerſity, conſiſting of three Colleges, founded by <hi>Henry Wardlaw,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> in the Year 1412. It obtained very ample Privileges and Immunities
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0141100404:167"/>
from Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII. which were afterwards confirmed to them by King <hi>James</hi> I. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by ſeveral other ſucceeding Kings. During Epiſcopacy the Archbiſhops were Chancellors of it. The Rector is choſen yearly, and by the Statutes ought to be one of the Principals of the three Colleges here, called <hi>St. Salvator's, St. Leonard's,</hi> and the <hi>New College.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Salvator's</hi> College was founded by <hi>James Kennedy,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>St. Andrews, Anno</hi> 1448. who erected the Edifice, furniſhed it with coſtly Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and endowed it with ſufficient Revenues for a Doctor, a Batchelor, and Licentiate of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, four Profeſſors of Philoſophy, and eight poor Scholars. The Earl of <hi>Caſſils</hi> ſettled a Maintenance for a Profeſſor of Philoſophy. It has a good Library founded by Dr. <hi>Sheen.</hi> The Edifice itſelf is a moſt ſtately Pile of fine hewn Stone, has a large vaulted Chapel covered with Free-ſtone, and over it is a very lofty Spire. The common Hall and Schools are vaſtly large; and the Cloiſters and private Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Maſters and Scholars have been very magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent and convenient; but the Fabrick is of late become very much out of Repair, nor is the College Revenue able to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Leonard's</hi> College was founded by <hi>John Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> Prior of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> V. with Salaries for a Principal or Warden, four Profeſſors of Philoſophy, and eight poor Scholars. A Profeſſor of Philology was added by Sir <hi>John Scot</hi> of <hi>Scots-tarvet,</hi> with a liberal Salary. He alſo augmented the Library very conſiderably; and Sir <hi>John Wedderburn,</hi> at his Death, left a great Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Books to it. <hi>Fordun's</hi> MS. of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Hiſtory is in this Library.</p>
            <p>The <hi>New College</hi> was founded by Archbiſhop <hi>Bethune,</hi> Uncle to the Cardinal of that Name, with Endowments for a Principal and Profeſſor of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0141100404:168"/>
Divinity, and ſome Students in the ſame Faculty; for no Philoſophy is taught in this College.</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt two Colleges, having a better Revenue to ſupport them, than that of <hi>St. Salvator,</hi> are in much better Repair. In the latter, King <hi>Charles</hi> I. held a Parliament, in a large ſpacious Room able to ſeat 400 Perſons in regular Order, and it ſtill retains the Name of the <hi>Parliament Room.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Profeſſor of Mathematicks was of late Years added to this Univerſity; as was alſo, not long ſince, a Profeſſor of Medicine, with a handſome Endowment by his Grace <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Chandos</hi>; whom the Univerſity, upon the Death of the Duke of <hi>Athol,</hi> in Gratitude, choſe to be their Chancellor; which Office is during Life; and to that alone, and that of his Vice-Chancellor, belongs the conferring of all Univerſity Degrees.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>James Gregory,</hi> Profeſſor of Mathematicks in this Univerſity, famous for his Knowledge in that Science, has erected in the College Gardens, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Obſervatory, and furniſhed it with good Mathematical Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>It has produced many learned Men; among others, the famous Lord <hi>Napier,</hi> who invented the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithms, Sir <hi>Robert Murray,</hi> Sir <hi>Andrew Balfour,</hi> and the great Lawyer Sir <hi>George Mackenzie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Harbour here has ſuffered ſo much by the Encroachments of the Sea, that I fear it will never be ſufficiently repaired. The Pier is founded upon a Rock of Free-ſtone, in Length about 440 Feet; but this Rock extends itſelf into the Sea 500 Feet further, on the Point of which ſtands a Beacon; and the great Rolling of the Sea, breaking over the Rock, between the Pier-end and this Beacon, makes the Harbour very dangerous. In the Year 1728. it was propoſed to be repaired, and the Pier carried as far as the Beacon, and a Brief was granted for that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0141100404:169"/>
Purpoſe. But the Collections were too ſmall to make any great Advances.</p>
            <p>By all we have ſaid, it will appear, that this antient City, and its Univerſity too, are in a very declining State. The Archbiſhop's Seat, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Courts kept there, beſide the great Reſort of Pilgrims to the Convents, brought great Buſineſs thither, which being now diſuſed, and one new College erected at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and another at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> contribute much to the Decay of both. The City enjoys ſtill ſome Privileges by the original Charter, yet extant, whereby it was incorporated by King <hi>David, Anno</hi> 1153.</p>
            <p>From <hi>St. Andrews</hi> we proceeded on to two very agreeable Seats belonging to the preſent Earl of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; one called <hi>Melvil,</hi> and the other <hi>Balgony. Melvil</hi> is a regular and beautiful Building, after the Model of Sir <hi>William Bruce</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Kinroſs,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed before. <hi>Balgony</hi> is an antient Seat, formerly belonging to the Family of <hi>Leſsly</hi>; and if not built, was inlarged and repaired by General <hi>Alexander Leſsly,</hi> noted for his Services in <hi>Germany,</hi> under <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi>; and at laſt, againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Leven</hi> runs hard by the Walls of the Houſe, and makes the Situation very pleaſant. The Park is large, but not well planted; at leaſt, the Trees do not thrive.</p>
            <p>From hence we went North to <hi>Cowpar,</hi> the Shire Town, and turned to the North-eaſt Part of the Country, to ſee the Ruins of the famous Monaſtery of <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> takes Notice; but we ſaw nothing worth our Obſervation, the very Ruins being almoſt eaten up by Time. The Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery was founded by Queen <hi>Ermengred,</hi> Wife of King <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we came to the Bank of another <hi>Firth,</hi> called the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Tay,</hi> which opening to a large
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0141100404:170"/>
Breadth at its Entrance, as the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> does, draws in afterwards, as that does at the <hi>Queen's-ferry,</hi> and makes a Ferry over at the Breadth of two Miles to the Town of <hi>Dundee</hi>; and then the <hi>Firth</hi> widening again juſt as that of the <hi>Forth</hi> does alſo, continues its Breadth from four to ſix Miles, till it comes almoſt to <hi>Perth,</hi> as the other does to <hi>Sterling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This River <hi>Tay</hi> is, without Exception, the largeſt River in <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' not of the longeſt Courſe; for it riſes out of the Mountains, near the Edge of <hi>Argyllſhire</hi>; and running firſt North into the Diſtrict of <hi>Braidalbin,</hi> there receiving many other Rivers, ſpreads itſelf into a large Lake, called <hi>Lough Tay,</hi> extending near 40 Miles in Length, and traverſing the very Heart of <hi>Scotland,</hi> comes into the Sea near this Place: Now, as I deſign to keep in this Part of my Work to the Eaſt Coaſt of the Country, I muſt for the preſent quit the <hi>Tay,</hi> keeping a little on the hither Side of it, and go back to that Part of the Country which lies to the South, and Eaſt of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barton</hi> or <hi>Lenoxſhire</hi>; ſo drawing an imaginary Line from <hi>Sterling-bridge,</hi> due North, thro' the Heart of the Country, to <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> which I take to lie almoſt due North and South.</p>
            <p>In this Courſe I moved from the Ferry mentioned above, to <hi>Perth,</hi> lying upon the ſame <hi>Tay,</hi> but on the hither Bank. It was formerly called <hi>Johnſton,</hi> or <hi>St. John's Town,</hi> from an old Church, dedicated to the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John,</hi> which is ſtill remaining, and ſo big as to make two Parochial Churches, and can ſerve the whole Town for their publick Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perth</hi> is the ſecond Town of <hi>Scotland</hi> for Dignity. Near it ſtood antiently the Town of <hi>Berth,</hi> which being overflowed by an Inundation of the <hi>Tay,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the building of this, where it now ſtands.</p>
            <p>The chief Buſineſs of this Town at preſent is the Linen Manufacture; which is ſo conſiderable here, that all the neighbouring Country is employed in it,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0141100404:171"/>
and it is the Wealth of the whole Place. The <hi>Tay</hi> is navigable up to the Town for Ships of good Burden; and they ſhip off here vaſt Quantities of Linen, for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Salmon taken here, and all over the <hi>Tay,</hi> are extremely good, and the Quantity prodigious. They carry them to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and to all the Towns where they have no Salmon, and barrel up great Quantities for Exportation: The Merchants of this Town have alſo a conſiderable Trade to the <hi>Baltick</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town was for ſome time the Seat of the late Rebellion; but by a peculiar Felicity the Townſmen got ſo much Money by both Parties, that they have ever ſince been enriched by it, as appears not only from particular Families, but from the publick and private Buildings which they have raiſed ſince that time; particularly a new <hi>Tolbooth</hi> or <hi>Town-hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will ſeem a little ſtrange to us in the South, that any Place ſhould be enriched by a Rebellion; but a few Words will explain it. It muſt be obſerved, that the <hi>Pretender</hi> and his Troops having their Quarters hereabouts a conſiderable time, occaſioned a great Conſumption of Victuals and Drink, which are ſo plentiful in theſe Parts, that 'tis frequent for Towns to petition the Government to have Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Soldiers quarter'd upon them; tho' in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> nothing gives greater Uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>Again, as the <hi>Pretender</hi> was here and at <hi>Scone,</hi> it occaſioned a great Confluence of Perſons of Note, who gathered about him, waiting the Iſſue of his Fortunes, till they found the Storm gathering from the South, and no probable Means to reſiſt it, and then they ſhifted off as they could.</p>
            <p>While they reſided here, Lodgings in the Town lett at ſuch a Rate, as was never known before; Proviſions were dear, Trade briſk; and had it laſted two or three Months longer, it would have made all the Towns rich in the Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0141100404:172"/>When this Cloud was diſperſed, the Victors enter'd; new Officers ſucceeded the routed Party. Still the Head Quarters were here; and afterwards the <hi>Dutch</hi> Troops continued here moſt Part of the Winter. All this while the Money flowed in, and the Town made their Market on both Sides; they were Gainers even by War and Foreigners!</p>
            <p>The Linen Trade, which we have mentioned before, has mightily increaſed ſince the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>England,</hi> for ſuppreſſing the Uſe of printed Calicoes; in the room of which <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Linens have been bought and printed in <hi>England:</hi> So that the Worſted and Silk Weavers in <hi>London</hi> ſeem to have had very little Benefit by the Act.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Ardock</hi> in <hi>Perthſhire</hi> are the Remains of a <hi>Roman</hi> Camp; and near <hi>Perth</hi> is a <hi>Roman</hi> Way, where ſeveral Medals, ſepulchral Urns, and other Monuments of Antiquity, have been found.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Perth,</hi> I went South to that Part which they call <hi>Clackmanan,</hi> lying Weſt from <hi>Dumfermling,</hi> and extending itſelf towards <hi>Sterling</hi> and <hi>Dumblain,</hi> none of which Part I had gone over before.</p>
            <p>North-eaſtward from <hi>Perth</hi> to <hi>Brechen</hi> lies a Vale which they call <hi>Strathmore,</hi> eſteemed the moſt fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Corn of all that Part of the Country: Here are a great many Gentlemens Seats, tho' on the North-ſide of the <hi>Tay,</hi> particularly the noble Palace of <hi>Glames,</hi> the Hereditary Seat of the Family of <hi>Lyon,</hi> Earls of <hi>Strathmore.</hi> The Heir in Reverſion now enjoys the Title and Eſtate, tho' it very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly eſcaped being forfeited; for the elder Brother entertained here the <hi>Pretender</hi> very magnificently, making up for him and his Retinue fourſcore and eight Beds, and afterwards eſpouſed his Cauſe ſo ſtrenuouſly, that he loſt his Life in his Service, at the Battle of <hi>Sheriff-muir.</hi> The Eſtate, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed, deſcended to the ſecond Son, or younger Brother, who is now Earl of <hi>Strathmore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0141100404:173"/>It is one of the fineſt old-built Palaces in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by far the largeſt. When you ſee it at a Diſtance, it is ſo full of Turrets and lofty Buildings, Spires and Towers, ſome plain, others ſhining with gilded Tops, that it looks not like a Town, but a City; and the Appearances ſeen thro' the long Viſta's of the Park are ſo different, that you would not think it the ſame Houſe any two Ways together.</p>
            <p>The great Avenue is a full half Mile, planted on either Side with ſeveral Rows of Trees. When you come to the outer Gate, you are ſurpriſed with the Beauty and Variety of the Statues and Buſts, ſome of Stone, ſome of Braſs, ſome gilded, ſome plain. The Statues in Braſs are four, one of King <hi>James</hi> VI. one of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. booted and ſpurred, as if going to take Horſe at the Head of his Army; one of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. habited like that in the <hi>Royal Exchange, London</hi>; and one of King <hi>James</hi> VII. after the Pattern of that which is at <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I came away South-weſt, and croſſing the <hi>Tay</hi> below <hi>Perth,</hi> but above <hi>Dundee,</hi> came at laſt to <hi>Dumblain,</hi> a Town pleaſantly ſituated, on the Banks of the River <hi>Allan</hi>; but without any ſort of Trade. It contains the Ruins of a Church of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Workmanſhip; but within our own Memory it was made famous by the Battle fought between the Army of King <hi>George</hi> I. under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Argyll,</hi> and the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Forces under the Earl of <hi>Mar,</hi> on <hi>Sheriff-muir,</hi> between this Place and <hi>Sterling.</hi> We took a full View of the Field of Battle, and could not but reflect with Surprize, that a Rabble of <hi>Highlanders</hi> appearing in Rebellion, armed in Haſte, and headed by a Perſon of no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in War, ſhould come ſo near to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing an Army of regular diſciplined Troops, and led on by experienced Officers, and ſo great a General.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0141100404:174"/>From hence I proceeded on in Sight of <hi>Sterling-bridge</hi>; but leaving it on the Right-hand, turned away Eaſt to <hi>Alloway,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Mar</hi> had a noble Seat, and where the Navigation of the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Forth</hi> begins. This is, as I hinted before, within four Miles of <hi>Sterling</hi> by Land, and ſcarcely within 24 by Water, occaſioned by thoſe uncommon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders and Reaches in the River, which gives ſo beautiful a Proſpect from the Caſtle of <hi>Sterling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fine Seat was formerly called the Caſtle of <hi>Alloway,</hi> but is now ſo completely modernized, that no Appearance of a Caſtle remains.</p>
            <p>The Gardens of <hi>Alloway</hi> Houſe are by much the fineſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not out-done by any in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> conſiſting of above 40 Acres of Ground; and the adjoining Wood, which is adapted to the Houſe in Avenues and Viſtas, above three times as much.</p>
            <p>Here is a Harbour where Ships of Burden ſafely ride. The <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Merchants have erected Ware-houſes, to which they bring their Tobacco and Sugars by Land, and then ſhip them for <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> or the <hi>Baltick,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> as they find the Market.</p>
            <p>The High-ſtreet of <hi>Alloway</hi> reaches down to this Harbour, and is a very ſpacious, well-built Street, with Rows of Trees finely planted all the Way. Here are ſeveral Teſtimonies of the Goodneſs of their Trade, as particularly a large Deal-yard, or Place for laying up all Sorts of <hi>Norway</hi> Goods, which ſhews that they have a Commerce thither. They have large Ware-houſes of naval Stores; ſuch as Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, two ſawing Mills for cutting or ſlitting of Deals; and a Rope-walk, for making all Sorts of Ropes and Cables for rigging and fitting Ships; with ſeveral other Things, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces us they are no Strangers to other Trades, as well by Sea as Land.</p>

               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0141100404:175"/>Eaſt from <hi>Alloway,</hi> is a ſmall County, called <hi>Clackmannanſhire,</hi> from the Head Burgh, and is Part of <hi>Fife.</hi> The Country is plain, the Soil fertile; moſt of it proper for Paſture; and what lies below the <hi>Orchil-hills,</hi> producing Corn very well. But the Shire is chiefly known for yielding the beſt of Coal, and the greateſt Quantity of it, of any Country of <hi>Scotland</hi>; ſo that it is carried, not only to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> but alſo to <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> But while the Freight from <hi>Scotland</hi> is ſo dear, and the Tax in <hi>England</hi> ſo heavy, the Price of theſe Coals muſt always be ſo high at <hi>London,</hi> as will not fail to reſtrain the Conſumption.</p>
            <p>On this Shore of the <hi>Firth,</hi> farther down, ſtands the neat and agreeable Town of <hi>Culroſs,</hi> lying in Length by the Water-ſide, like <hi>Kirkaldy,</hi> being likewiſe a Trading Town, as Trade muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Here is a pretty Market, a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Country behind it, and the navigable <hi>Firth</hi> before it. The Coal, the Linen Manufacture, and Plenty of Corn, will always keep ſomething of Trade alive upon the whole Coaſt.</p>
            <p>Here is a very noble Seat belonging to the <hi>Bruces,</hi> Earls of <hi>Kincairn,</hi> and is well worth a Traveller's Notice; and indeed theſe Inſtances of Magnificence are ſo frequent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that were we to dwell upon each of them, ſuch of our Readers as know nothing of <hi>Scotland</hi> would be apt to think we were too partial in its Favour. But it is certain, that no Gentry or Nobility in the World exceeded the <hi>Scots,</hi> while an independent Kingdom, in noble Houſes, and all manner of Magnificence; as their Families for Antiquity of Deſcent hardly have any Equals in any one Country on Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Culroſs</hi> is a Royal Burgh in the Shire of <hi>Perth,</hi> but in the Confines of <hi>Fife,</hi> famous for a Branch of the Iron Manufacture in making Girdles, <hi>i. e.</hi> broad round Plates, on which they bake their oaten Cakes.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0141100404:176"/>
They told me of Mines of Copper, and of Lead, lately diſcovered in <hi>Fife,</hi> and of Silver alſo: But I could not learn that any of them were actually wrought. It is, however, not improbable, but that there are ſuch Mines; and particularly the two <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> which are remarkable Mountains in this Shire, ſeem to promiſe Metal in their Bowels, if they were thoroughly ſearched. They riſe up like two Sugar-loaves in the Middle of a plain Country, not far from <hi>Falkland,</hi> and give a View of the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> South, and the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Tay</hi> North, and are ſeen from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> very plain.</p>
            <p>Having made this little Excurſion to the South from <hi>Perth,</hi> you may ſuppoſe me now returned Northward again; and we proceeded to <hi>Scone,</hi> that antient Seat of Royal Ceremony, where almoſt all the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were crowned, ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Picts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The celebrated Wooden Chair, with the Stone in it, was brought away from hence, as is well known, by the victorious King <hi>Edward</hi> I. and placed in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> where it now is; but the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Royal Blood ſucceeding to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, in the Perſon of King <hi>James</hi> I. of <hi>England,</hi> and VI. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> verify'd the following prophetick Diſtich, tho' at the Time, it was accounted no ſmall Loſs and Diſgrace to the Kingdom. The Lines were theſe:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ni fallat Fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Invenient Lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
Thus tranſlated by the <hi>Scots:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Unleſs old Prophets fail, and Wizards Wit decay,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Where-e'er this Stone is found, the</hi> Scots <hi>ſhall reign for ay.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid to have been firſt dignified by K. <hi>Kenneth,</hi> who having fought a bloody Battle here with the <hi>Picts,</hi> in which he gave them a great Overthrow, ſat down to reſt him upon this Stone, after he had
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0141100404:177"/>
been tired with the Slaughter of the Enemy; upon which his Nobles came round him to congratulate his Succeſs; and in Honour to his Valour, crowned him with a Garland of Victory; from whence he dedicated the Stone to the Coronation of all the future Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hoping from this Omen, that they ſhould, like him, be victorious over all their Enemies.</p>
            <p>But the better Sort of <hi>Scots</hi> Hiſtorians ſay, their Kings brought it from <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>I-Colm-Kill</hi> in the Iſles, and from thence to <hi>Scone</hi> or <hi>Scoon,</hi> when they had ſubdued the <hi>Picts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Palace of <hi>Scoon,</hi> tho' antient, is not ſo much decay'd as thoſe I have already ſpoken of; and the <hi>Pretender</hi> found it very well in Repair for his Uſe. Here he lived and kept his Court, in all the State and Appearance of a Sovereign; but it was a ſhort-lived Splendor; for in 20 Days he was obliged to quit the Kingdom, by the Advance of the Royal Army. In this Palace is the longeſt Gallery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Ceiling painted, but the Painting very old.</p>
            <p>The Building is large, the Front being above 200 Feet; it has two extraordinary fine ſquare Courts, beſides others, which contain the Offices, Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Royal Apartments are ſpacious and large; but the whole Building is intirely after the antient Manner.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Scoon</hi> to <hi>Dunkeld</hi> is ſo little a Way, that we could not help viſiting it, being the Place where a Skirmiſh was fought between the Forces of King <hi>William,</hi> after the Revolution, and ſome of the Viſcount of <hi>Dundee</hi>'s Men, who purſued the King's Forces, as they were obliged to retire from <hi>Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranky,</hi> after Lord <hi>Dundee</hi> himſelf had been killed there. The Duke of <hi>Athol</hi> has a noble old Houſe here, in one of the Courts of which that Part of the Action happened.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0141100404:178"/>Here was formerly a beautiful and magnificent Cathedral Church, dedicated to St. <hi>Columba,</hi> the Seat of a Biſhop, whoſe Chapter or Prebendaries were <hi>Culdees,</hi> or <hi>Black Monks</hi>; but they are now diſſolved, and moſt Part of the Church in Ruins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dunkeld</hi> is the chief Market-town of the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and ſuppoſed to have been formerly the chief Town of <hi>Caledonia.</hi> It is ſituated on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the <hi>Tay,</hi> at the Foot of the <hi>Grampian</hi> Hills, and is ſurrounded with pleaſant Woods.</p>
            <p>Upon the River <hi>Tay</hi> alſo lies <hi>Errol,</hi> the Seat of the Earl of that Name, chief of the antient Family of <hi>Hay,</hi> who derive their Origin from a famous Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, who in the Reign of <hi>Kenneth</hi> III. being at Plough with his two Sons, and perceiving the <hi>Scots</hi> fleeing before the <hi>Danes,</hi> he and his two Sons ſtopt their Flight, renew'd the Battle, and gained the Victory; for which they had the Lands of <hi>Errol</hi> beſtowed upon them; and the Family Arms is three bloody Shields, ſupported by two naked Men with Yokes, in Remembrance of this famous Victory; the Father and two Sons having no other Weapons when they put themſelves at the Head of the flying <hi>Scots,</hi> but the Yokes they took from their Ploughs. Of this Family are, beſides the Earls of <hi>Errol,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Tweedale,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Kinnoul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But our determined Rout lay up the Eaſtern Shore, and thro' the Shires adjacent on that Side, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Angus, Mearns, Marr, Aberdeen, Buchan,</hi> and ſo, as I laid it out before, to <hi>Inverneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> tells us, That the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Tay</hi> was the utmoſt Boundary of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <hi>Britain:</hi> That <hi>Julius Agricola,</hi> the beſt of Generals, under <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> the worſt of Emperors, tho' he pierced far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and traverſed by Land into the Heart of the <hi>Highlands,</hi> yet ſeeing no End of a barbarous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and no Advantage by the Conqueſt of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and here fixed the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles; that he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0141100404:179"/>
frequently haraſſed the <hi>Picts</hi> by Excurſions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads, but always returned to his Poſt here, making the <hi>Tay</hi> his Frontier.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Engliſh Caeſars</hi> have outgone the <hi>Romans</hi>; for <hi>Edward</hi> I. as is ſaid before, paſſed the <hi>Tay,</hi> and rifled the Abbey at <hi>Scoon</hi>; and, if we may believe Hiſtory, penetrated into the remoteſt Parts, which, however, I take to be only the remoteſt Parts of what was then known to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; for as to the <hi>Highlands,</hi> the Mountains of <hi>Loquhaber, Roſs, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, Sutherland,</hi> and <hi>Caithneſs,</hi> we read nothing of them: From theſe Retreats the <hi>Scots</hi> always returned, <hi>Antaeus</hi> like, with double Strength after every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat; till in the next Reign they overthrew his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Edward</hi> II. at <hi>Bannockbourn,</hi> and drove the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of the whole Country; following them over <hi>Tweed</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and ravaging the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> indeed, (according to the Motto of a noble Houſe in <hi>Scotland, Rode Through</hi>) pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated to the remoteſt Part of the Iſland; and that he might even literally rule it with a Rod of Iron, built Citadels and Forts in all the Angles and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, where he found it needful to place his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary Legions, juſt as the <hi>Romans</hi> did; as at <hi>Leith,</hi> at <hi>St. Andrew's,</hi> at <hi>Inverneſs, Perth, Aire,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Places. We have ſince ſeen the Forces of King <hi>George</hi> I. making the ſame Rout, nay, ferrying over into the Weſtern, and North-weſtern Iſlands; here again imitating the Prudence of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> who employ'd their Soldiery in mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Roads, and making Cauſeways over Mountains, that were before thought inacceſſible.</p>
            <p>Where Armies have marched, there's Room enough, no doubt, for Travellers. With this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therefore, we chearfully croſſed the <hi>Tay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We left <hi>Strathern,</hi> with the little Country of <hi>Menteith</hi>; for our Return, and went down into
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0141100404:180"/>
               <hi>Angus</hi> to <hi>Dundee,</hi> a pleaſant, large, populous City, which as it ſtands well for Trade, ſo it has as large a Share of it, as moſt Towns in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that as well Foreign as Domeſtick.</p>
            <p>It is exceeding populous, full of ſtately Houſes, and large handſome Streets; particularly four very good ones, with a large Market-place in the Middle, the largeſt and faireſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> except that of <hi>Aberdeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants have a very large Correſpondence with <hi>England,</hi> and ſhip off a great deal of Linen thither; and a great Quantity of Corn is ſent from hence to <hi>England,</hi> as well as to <hi>Holland.</hi> They have likewiſe a good Share of the <hi>Norway</hi> Trade; and as they are concerned in the Herring Fiſhery, they conſequently have ſome Eaſt Country Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Dantzick, Koningſberg, Riga,</hi> &amp;c. They ſend Ships alſo to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and import Iron, Copper, Tar, Pitch, Deals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the ſeveral trading Ports of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Country behind them called the <hi>Carſe,</hi> or the <hi>Carſe of Gowry,</hi> with the Vale mentioned above of <hi>Strathmore,</hi> abounds in Corn, which the Port of <hi>Dundee</hi> ſhips off in large Quantities, when a Crop allows it, to the great Advantage of the Gentlemen as well as Farmers; for as the Gentlemen receive all their Rents in Kind, they would find a great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſometimes to diſpoſe of it, if the Merchants here did not ſhip it off, either for <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Dundee</hi> ſtands at a little Diſtance from the <hi>Tay</hi>; but they are joined by a Cauſeway or Walk, well paved with flat Free-ſtone, ſuch as the Side-ways in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> and <hi>Cornhill</hi>; and Rows of Trees are planted on either Side of the Walk, which makes it very agreeable. On one Part of this Walk are very good Warehouſes for Merchandizes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for heavy Goods; and alſo Granaries for Corn
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0141100404:181"/>
of which ſometimes they have a vaſt Quantity laid up here; and theſe, being near the Harbour, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, as well for the houſing of Goods, when landed, as for the eaſy ſhipping off what lies for Exportation.</p>
            <p>The Harbour of <hi>Dundee</hi> was formerly very good and ſafe; but of late Years became ſo ruinous and choaked up with Sand, that it would not contain, as antiently, Ships of Burden, except at the higheſt Tides; and its Piers were ſo out of Repair, that Ships could not lie in it with Safety. At the ſame time the Tolbooth and publick Gaol were ſo much decay'd, that they were obliged to be pulled down; and the Town, being greatly in Debt beſides, could not rebuild the ſame. Wherefore, to anſwer all theſe good Purpoſes, and to pave the Streets, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Debts, and provide Salaries for School-maſters to inſtruct their Children, an Act paſſed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1731. for continuing the Duties impoſed by a former Act, then near expired, of Two-penies <hi>Scots,</hi> upon every Pint of Ale and Beer ſold within the Town and its Privileges, for 25 Years longer. And the Inhabitants now reap the Benefit of it, and will ſtill more, when the propoſed Works are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfected.</p>
            <p>This Town was ſtorm'd and plunder'd of great Riches by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>The great Church was formerly collegiate, and a very large Building; but part of it was demoliſhed in the Civil War; the Remainder is divided into three Churches for the preſent Uſe of the Citizens.</p>
            <p>They have alſo a Meeting-houſe or two for the Epiſcopal Worſhip; for you are to take it once for all, that North of <hi>Tay,</hi> there are far more of the Epiſcopal Perſuaſion than are to be found in the South; and the farther North, the more ſo.</p>
            <p>The Tower upon the great Church here is a handſome ſquare Building, large and antient, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0141100404:182"/>
very high, and is a good Ornament to the City: It reſembles the great Tower upon the Cathedral of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but not quite ſo high. There is a fine and well-endowed Hoſpital for decay'd Townſmen of <hi>Dundee,</hi> where they are well taken care of, and provided for. The <hi>Pretender</hi> was in this City ſoon after his Landing, and ſtaid here ſome time, before he advanced to <hi>Scoon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the Birth-place of <hi>Hector Boetius,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> Hiſtorian; a Man famous in his Time, and whoſe Work was antiently more in Eſteem, than of late. It gave the Title of Viſcount to <hi>Graham</hi> of <hi>Clavers,</hi> who commanded the Forces that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for the late King <hi>James</hi> at the Revolution, and was killed at the Battle of <hi>Gillicranky,</hi> which I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>Near to <hi>Dundee,</hi> in the Mouth of the River, lies <hi>Brochty-craig,</hi> formerly well-fortify'd, and noted now for a noble Salmon-fiſhery in its Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>It is 20 <hi>Scots</hi> Miles from <hi>Dundee</hi> to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> the Way pleaſant, the Country fruitful, and filled with Gentlemens Houſes. Among theſe is the noble Palace of <hi>Panmure,</hi> forfeited in the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion by the unfortunate Earl of that Name, who was wounded in the Fight near <hi>Dumblain.</hi> The Surname of the Family is <hi>Maul</hi>; and <hi>Maulſburgh,</hi> a ſmall Town near <hi>Montroſe,</hi> is called from it.</p>
            <p>The Town and Port of <hi>Montroſe</hi> was our next Stage, ſtanding upon the Eaſtmoſt Shore of <hi>Angus,</hi> open to the <hi>German,</hi> or the <hi>Caledonian</hi> Ocean, and at the Mouth of the little River of <hi>Southeſk,</hi> which makes the Harbour.</p>
            <p>This Town is well ſituated for Trade, and has a good Harbour, and the Inhabitants always carried on an advantageous Trade with <hi>Norway.</hi> But as it was ſtill capable of great Improvements, were a Dock to be made for the Conveniency of Shipping; and if good freſh Water could be procured for it, of which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0141100404:183"/>
it ſtood in very great Want; and the two Hills that defend the Town againſt Inundations, having alſo ſuffered by Tempeſts; the Corporation procured an Act, <hi>Anno</hi> 1719. for laying a Duty of Two-penies <hi>Scots</hi> upon every Pint of Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſold within the Town and its Privileges, for effecting theſe good Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The Town is adorned with fine Buildings, and has an Hoſpital for the poorer Inhabitants. It gives Title of Duke, as it did formerly of Earl and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, to the Chief of the antient and noble Family of <hi>Graham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Fleet firſt made Land at this Port, when they had the <hi>Pretender</hi> on board, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> having over-ſhot the Mouth of the <hi>Firth</hi> ſo far, whither they at firſt deſigned; but this Miſtake, which ſome thought a Misfortune, was certainly a Deliverance to them; for as on one hand it gave time to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet to come up with them before they could enter the <hi>Firth,</hi> ſo it left them time and room alſo to make their Eſcape; which, if they had gone up the <hi>Firth,</hi> they could never have done, but muſt inevitably have been burnt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, or taken by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet under Sir <hi>George Byng,</hi> which was ſuperior to them in Force.</p>
            <p>The Royal Burgh of <hi>Aberbrothock</hi> on this Coaſt, beſides being famous for the ſtately Ruins of the greateſt Abbey in <hi>Scotland,</hi> deſerves to be mentioned for its convenient Situation for Trade; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, ſome Years ſince, the Inhabitants to lay the Foundation of a new Harbour, the old one being ſo decayed, that it was hazardous even for ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to ſail into it. But the Work exceeding their Abilities, they procured Contributions towards ſo good a Deſign; but ſtill all proving ſhort of what was requiſite to complete the Work, and the Town having run itſelf into Debt by what it had done, and at the ſame time the publick Streets and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0141100404:184"/>
Cauſeways, as well as the Town-houſe and Gaol, being in a very ruinous Condition, they procured an Act to paſs in the 11th of King <hi>George</hi> II. for laying a Duty of Two-penies <hi>Scots</hi> upon every <hi>Scots</hi> Pint of Ale or Beer ſold within the Town and Liberties, which was to commence in <hi>May</hi> 1738. and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for 25 Years, for bringing to Effect theſe good Purpoſes. And we may ſay, that of late ſo many of theſe Acts have paſſed, that <hi>Scotland</hi> will in a few Years, if haraſſed by no inteſtine Broils, and continuing in Peace, make a better Figure than it has done for Centuries paſt.</p>
            <p>The Abbey was formerly endowed with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues by King <hi>William</hi> I. who was buried here under a ſtately Monument.</p>
            <p>In the inner Parts of the Shire, to the Weſtward, is <hi>Forfar</hi> the County Town, and <hi>Brechin</hi> formerly a Biſhop's See, made ſo by K. <hi>David,</hi> and where ſome Part of a ſmall Cathedral is ſtill ſtanding. It is ſeated upon the River <hi>Southeſk,</hi> over which it has a ſtately Bridge of two Arches, and is conſiderable for its Salmon and Cattle-markets. It is alſo memorable for a great Victory obtained here over the <hi>Danes,</hi> by the Chief of the Family of <hi>Keith,</hi> Earl Mareſchal, who having killed their General, was advanced to great Honours by <hi>Malcolm</hi> II. There was a high Stone erected over the Grave of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> General, which is ſtill called <hi>Camus's Croſs,</hi> from his Name; and at 10 Miles Diſtance is another Croſs, over the Grave of another eminent <hi>Daniſh</hi> Warrior; and both of them have antique Letters and Pictures upon them.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Montroſe</hi> the Shore lies due North to <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen:</hi> In the Way is the Caſtle of <hi>Dunnoter,</hi> once a ſtrong Fortification upon an high Precipice of a Rock. The Caſtle was ſurrounded with invincible Walls, (ſaid the honeſt <hi>Scot,</hi> who ſhewed us the Road to it) having Towers at proper Diſtances,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0141100404:185"/>
after the old Way of fortifying Towns. The Earl Mareſchal, of the Name of <hi>Keith,</hi> was Lord of this Caſtle, as alſo of a good Houſe near it, and a great Eſtate: But what he had, is now gone; for, being in the Rebellion, his Eſtate was forfeited, and his Lordſhip, making his Eſcape, went into the Service of <hi>Spain,</hi> in which he ſtill continues. But we ought to obſerve, that his Brother, going into the Service of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> made ſuch a Figure there, that he is a Lieutenant-General in that Empire, and greatly eſteemed for his perſonal Bravery and Conduct. This Gentleman making, lately, a Viſit to <hi>England,</hi> was received with great Marks of Diſtinction and Favour, by the Court and Nobility; and may be truly ſaid to be one of the beſt Generals that the late Czarina, who yet had many excellent Commanders, had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to boaſt of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dunnoter</hi> Caſtle is now demoliſhed. It is ſituated in the Shire of <hi>Kincardin</hi> called the <hi>Merns.</hi> The County is noted for its Timber, having in it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Five Millions of Fir-trees, beſides vaſt Numbers of other Kinds, planted within theſe 70 Years by the Gentry, at and about their Seats, and which they are yearly adding to, and improving. <hi>Kincardin</hi> was formerly the County-town; but that Advantage now, by Statute, belongs to <hi>Stonehyne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Innerbervy,</hi> on the Coaſt, was made a Royal Burgh by King <hi>Alexander</hi> III.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paldykirk,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Palladius,</hi> firſt Biſhop of the <hi>Scots,</hi> is noted for its annual three Days Fair: The principal Commodity brought to it is coarſe Cloth, which is commonly tranſported to the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Lands of <hi>Arbuthie</hi> and <hi>Redeloak,</hi> are ſome Trenches to be ſeen, caſt up by the <hi>Danes</hi> at one of their Invaſions: And round the Hill of <hi>Urie</hi> is a deep Ditch, where the <hi>Scots</hi> encamped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fordun</hi> lies alſo in this County, famous in antient Times for the Reliques of the aforeſaid St. <hi>Palladius.</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0141100404:186"/>
It is alſo noted for being the Surname of <hi>John For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> Hiſtorian, Author of the Book called <hi>The Scots Chronicon,</hi> to which all ſucceeding Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of this Nation have been much obliged.</p>
            <p>The Earl Mareſchal was hereditary Sheriff of this Country.</p>
            <p>We proceeded then to <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> a Place ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that it commands ſome Stay upon it. It ſtands at the Mouth of two Rivers, and is divided into two Towns or Cities, one called the <hi>New,</hi> the other the <hi>Old Aberdeen,</hi> about a Mile diſtant from each other; one ſituate on the River <hi>Don,</hi> the other on the River <hi>Dee,</hi> from whence they are more properly called <hi>Aberdon</hi> and <hi>Aberdeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aberdon,</hi> or the <hi>Old Town,</hi> lies a Mile Northward from <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> or the <hi>New Town,</hi> and is ſometimes called <hi>Bon-accord,</hi> from its Motto. It is ſituated in the Mouth of the River <hi>Don,</hi> which is remarkable for the Multitude of Salmon and Perch taken in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Old Town</hi> muſt, without doubt, be very antient; for they tell us the <hi>New Aberdeen</hi> is ſuppoſed to be upwards of 1200 Years old, tho' none of their Regiſters mention the particular Time of its being built, or by whom. The Cities are not equally ſituated for Trade, one of the Rivers being broader than the other; and it is the common Opinion, that Part of the old City, called <hi>the Monaſtery,</hi> was waſhed down by the Sea, ſo that it obliged the Citizens to build farther off: That accordingly they built the <hi>New Aberdeen</hi> upon the Bank of the other River, upon a Piece of hilly Ground: But this is all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and has Probability only for its Support.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Old Aberdeen</hi> was formerly the Biſhop's Seat, and has a Cathedral, commonly called <hi>St. Machar</hi>'s, a large and ſtately Structure, which was antiently much more magnificent: it ſuffered greatly at the Time of the Reformation, and more ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0141100404:187"/>The chief Ornament of this Town is the <hi>King's College</hi> on the South Side of it, a neat and ſtately Structure.</p>
            <p>The Church and Steeple are built of hewn Stone, and the Summit of the latter reſembles an Imperial Crown. The Windows of the Church were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly eſteemed for their Paintings; and ſomething of their Splendor ſtill remains. In the Steeple are two Bells of extraordinary Bigneſs, beſides others.</p>
            <p>Cloſe to the Church is a Library well furniſhed with Books.</p>
            <p>This College was founded by Biſhop <hi>Elphinſton,</hi> in the Year 1500. and the greateſt Part built by him; but King <hi>James</hi> IV. taking the Patronage upon him, it was called <hi>The King's College.</hi> The Bull for it was procured from Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. in 1510. endowing it with as ample Privileges as thoſe of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Bononia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are in this College a Principal, a Sub-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, who is alſo one of the Regents, three other Regents, or Profeſſors of Philoſophy, a Profeſſor of Humanity or Philology, a Profeſſor of Divinity, a Doctor of Phyſick, a Profeſſor of the Oriental Tongues, a Profeſſor of the Civil Law, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the Mathematicks. Dr. <hi>Frazer</hi> has lately been a great Benefactor to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New Aberdeen</hi> is about a Mile diſtant, as we have ſaid, from the <hi>Old,</hi> ſituated at the Mouth of the River <hi>Dee.</hi> It is the County Town, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the Seat of the Sheriffs Courts. It exceeds all the Cities in the North of <hi>Scotland</hi> for Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Extent and Beauty. It ſtands in a wholſome Air, has a great Revenue from its Salmon-fiſhery, and the Inhabitants are generally very courteous. It ſtands upon three Hills; the main Part upon the higheſt, and the Skirts of it extend into the Plain. The Houſes are neatly built, are generally four Stories high, or more, and have for the moſt part
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0141100404:188"/>
Gardens and Orchards belonging to them, which makes the City pleaſant and healthful, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it beautiful at a Diſtance.</p>
            <p>From a round Hill, at the Weſt End of the City, flow two Springs, one of clear Water, and another with Water, which, in Taſte and Quality, comes very near the <hi>Spaw</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> Dr. <hi>William Barclay</hi> wrote a Treatiſe concerning it.</p>
            <p>In the High-ſtreet is a Church built of Free-ſtone, and good Architecture.</p>
            <p>In this City ſtands the <hi>Marſhal College,</hi> founded by <hi>George</hi> Earl Marſhal, in the Year 1593. to which the City has added many Buildings at their own Charge.</p>
            <p>In this College, which is a diſtinct Univerſity of itſelf, are a Principal, four Profeſſors of Philoſophy, a Profeſſor of Divinity, and a Profeſſor of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and there is lately added a Profeſſor of Phyſick. It has a very good Library, which was founded by the City, inlarged by the Gifts of ſeveral learned Men, and furniſhed with Mathematical Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>In this City is alſo a Grammar School, founded by Dr. <hi>Dune,</hi> having one Maſter and three Uſhers. There is alſo a Muſick School.</p>
            <p>The Church called <hi>St. Nicolas</hi>'s, is a handſome Edifice of Free-ſtone, with a lofty Steeple, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a Pyramid; it was formerly divided into three Churches. The Body of this Church is adorned with a Tower, and a Steeple with Pinacles.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo a Priſon and a Work-houſe belonging to the Town, likewiſe an Alms-houſe, and three Hoſpitals; and near the Harbour ſtands the Cuſtom-houſe. The Market-place is very beautiful and ſpacious, and the Streets adjoining are very handſome, and moſt of the Houſes are built of Stone, four Stories high, with handſome Saſh-windows, and are very well furniſhed within; the Citizens here

being as gay, as genteel, and perhaps as rich, as in any City in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

            <p>The Bridge at <hi>Old Aberdeen,</hi> over the <hi>Don,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of one immenſe Arch of Stone, ſprung from two Rocks, one on each Side, which ſerve as a Buttment to the Arch, ſo that it may be ſaid to have a Foundation coeval with Nature, and which will laſt as long. The other Bridge is upon the River <hi>Dee,</hi> Weſt above <hi>New Aberdeen,</hi> and has ſeven very ſtately Arches.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and indeed of almoſt all this Country, are generally of the Epiſcopal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion; ſo that, were it not for the legal Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Preſbyterian Preachers would have but few Hearers, and ſlender Incomes: Almoſt every Pariſh has a Meeting-houſe, where the Liturgy is read: At <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Peterhead</hi> they have beautiful Chapels, and even Organs.</p>
            <p>Near the City is a ſtately Stone Bridge of ſeven Arches over the <hi>Dee,</hi> built by Biſhop <hi>Gawin Dumbar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Air of this County, to thoſe who were born in a hotter, ſeems cold, but is in itſelf healthful and temperate. The Winter is milder than can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſuch a Climate, which ſeems a Wonder to <hi>Danes, Poles,</hi> and <hi>Pruſſians,</hi> when they come into this Country, and conſider that with them, during the Winter, there is nothing but perpetual Froſt and Snow. The Soil in general is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, if duly cultivated; it produces Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats in abundance, Peaſe and Beans; nor do they want Roots and Herbs for Food and Phyſick; and foreign Plants grow very well there, as daily Experience teſtifies. The mountainous Part of the County affords very good Paſturage, and the other as good Corn.</p>
            <p>The adjoining Sea not only furniſhes them with plenty of Fiſh, but reproaches them with their Negligence, when they ſee the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually

fiſhing on the Coaſts, from whence they reap great Gain; but 'tis the Humour of the Inhabitants to apply themſelves to the Salmon-fiſhing, and to neglect that of all other Sorts.</p>
            <p>The Quantity of Salmon and Perches, taken in both Rivers, is a kind of Prodigy. The Proprietors are united into a Company, there being ſo many Shares, of which no Perſon can enjoy above one at a time. The Profits are very conſiderable, the Salmon being ſent abroad into different Parts of the World, particularly into <hi>England, France,</hi> the <hi>Baltick,</hi> and ſeveral other Places.</p>
            <p>The Herring-fiſhing is a common Bleſſing to all this Shore of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is like the <hi>Indies</hi> at their Door, were it properly uſed, by the <hi>Scots</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: But I muſt obſerve, that by this, however, the Merchants of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> are able to carry on a Trade to <hi>Dantzick</hi> and <hi>Koningſberg, Riga</hi> and <hi>Narva, Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh</hi> and <hi>Stockholm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have alſo a very good Manufacture of Linen, and likewiſe of Worſted Stockens, which they ſend to <hi>England</hi> in great Quantities, and of which they make ſome ſo fine, that I have ſeen them ſold for 14, 20, and 30 Shillings a Pair. They alſo ſend them over to <hi>Holland,</hi> and into the North and Eaſt Seas, in large Quantities.</p>
            <p>They have alſo a particular Export here of Pork, pickled and packed up in Barrels, which they ſell chiefly to the <hi>Dutch</hi> for the victualling their <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> Ships and their Men of War, the <hi>Aberdeen</hi> Pork having the Reputation of being the beſt cured, for keeping on very long Voyages, of any in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They export alſo Corn and Meal; but they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally bring it from the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Murray,</hi> or <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marty,</hi> the Corn coming from about <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> where they have great Quantities.</p>
            <p>In a word, the People of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> are univerſal Merchants, ſo far as the Trade of the Northern Part
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0141100404:191"/>
of the World will extend; and it may be eſteemed the third City in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that is, the next after <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Shire contains in it <hi>Mar,</hi> with its Appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, <hi>Birſe, Glentaner, Glenmuick, Strathdee, Strathdon, Braes</hi> of <hi>Mar</hi> and <hi>Cromar,</hi> moſt part of <hi>Buchan, Formartin, Garioch,</hi> and <hi>Strathbogy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The latter is a large and antient Barony, watered by the Rivers <hi>Dovern</hi> and <hi>Bogy</hi>; it was erected into an Earldom by King <hi>James</hi> VI. in favour of the Chief of the noble and antient Family of <hi>Gordon,</hi> whom he afterwards created Marquis of <hi>Huntley. Strathbogy</hi> is very fruitful in Corn and Paſturage, and is remarkable for the fine Linen-yarn ſpun by the Women there, and ſold to the Merchant.</p>
            <p>It is moſtly inhabited by <hi>Gordons,</hi> Vaſſals to the Duke of <hi>Gordon,</hi> who has a magnificent Caſtle here, called <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> from the Name of the County. There are of this Name, beſides the Duke, the Earls of <hi>Sutherland, Aboyn, Aberdeen,</hi> and late Viſcount of <hi>Kenmure</hi>; likewiſe a great many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Note in other Parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The County of <hi>Mar</hi> gave Title of Earl to the Chief of the Family of <hi>Erſkine.</hi> The Sheriffdom is the King's Gift.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Aberdeenſhire</hi> are Quarries of ſpotted Marble and Slate, and Pearls are found in their Rivers of a large Size, and fine Colour.</p>
            <p>There was formerly a Mint at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by ſeveral Pieces of Coin with the <hi>Aberdeae</hi> upon them, kept in the Cloſets of the Curious.</p>
            <p>Other Towns in this County are;

            <p>We ought not to omit, that on the 30th of <hi>October</hi> 1721. an accidental Fire broke out in <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> whereby the Commiſſary-Clerk's Office was ſuddenly conſumed, and at the ſame time the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters and Records of all Teſtaments and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all Acts of Curacy, Judicial Deeds, and other Writs and Evidences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were intirely burnt and deſtroyed; which unhappy Accident being likely to be attended with pernicious Effects to Perſons Rights and Properties, an Act paſſed 8 <hi>George</hi> I. for ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Records ſo burnt or loſt; and another in the 9th of the ſame Reign, for making the former more effectual.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> had ſuffered much by the publick Commotions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took place, ſo that an Act for laying the Duty of Two-penies <hi>Scots</hi> on every <hi>Scots</hi> Pint of Ale and Beer ſold within the Town, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had been impoſed by the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Parliament in 1695. and continued by the ſame in 1707. for enabling them to diſcharge the Debts incurred on that Occaſion. And the laſt Act being near expired, and Debts ſtill remaining unpaid, an Act paſſed 1731. for continuing the ſaid Duties, for the following good Purpoſes; <hi>viz.</hi> for paying off the remaining Debts of the Town; for building a new Pier on the North-ſide of the Harbour, for repairing the old Pier on the South-ſide, which was very much ſunk and decay'd; for repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Church, called the <hi>Old Church,</hi> which was in a very decayed Condition; for rebuilding the Town-houſe, which was alſo in a very bad State; and for maintaining and carrying on other publick Works for the Benefit of the Town. This Act is to remain in Force for 25 Years; and it may be eaſily judged, that the Town of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> will be much improved, when the propoſed Works are all abſolutely completed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0141100404:193"/>From <hi>Aberdeen</hi> the Coaſt goes on to a Point of Land, which is the fartheſt North-eaſt Part of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and is called by the Sailors <hi>Buchanneſs,</hi> being in the Shire or County of <hi>Buchan,</hi> Part of which belongs to <hi>Aberdeenſhire.</hi> It was to this Point the <hi>French</hi> Squadron, with the <hi>Pretender</hi> on board, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> kept their Flight in Sight of the Shore, being thus far purſued by Sir <hi>George Byng</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet; but from hence they ſteer'd away North-eaſt as if for the <hi>Norway</hi> Coaſt, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral, ſeeing no Probability of coming up with them, gave over the Chace; but they altered their Courſe in the Night, ſtood away South, and came back to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> whence they ſet out.</p>
            <p>On the South-ſide of the Water of <hi>Eugic</hi> ſtands <hi>Peterhead,</hi> with a Road which will hold 100 Sail of Ships; and at this Place it is High-water, when the Moon is directly South. In many Places of this Shire are great Stones placed circularly, one of the largeſt in the Middle towards the South, which have the Air of Places of Worſhip in the Ages of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm. The dropping Cave of <hi>Slanes</hi> is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, of the petrify'd Subſtance whereof is made excellent Lime.</p>
            <p>This Country, however remote, is full of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, and their Seats are ſeen even unto the extremeſt Shores: The Family of <hi>Frazer</hi> carries its Name to <hi>Frazerburgh,</hi> in the very Northermoſt Point of the Country. <hi>Ereſkines,</hi> Earls of <hi>Marr,</hi> had their Family-ſeat at <hi>Kildrummy,</hi> in the County of <hi>Marr,</hi> a little South of this Part of the County, where the late unhappy Earl firſt ſet up his Standard for the <hi>Pretender.</hi> The <hi>Hayes,</hi> Earls of <hi>Errol,</hi> are in <hi>Buchan</hi>; and the Family of <hi>Forbes</hi> Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi> and <hi>Forbes</hi> Lord <hi>Pitſligo,</hi> are ſtill farther, and the latter on the very Shore of the <hi>Caledonian</hi> Ocean. The <hi>Gordons</hi> and <hi>Keiths</hi> are very numerous alſo in theſe Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0141100404:194"/>Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> relates, that on the Coaſt of this Country a great Piece of Amber was driven on Shore by the Force of the Sea, as big (to uſe his own Words) <hi>As an Horſe.</hi> I ſhall add nothing to the Story, becauſe it is hard to give Credit to it: it is enough that I name my Author; for I could not learn from the Inhabitants, that they ever ſaw any more of it.</p>
            <p>I ought not to omit <hi>Innerury,</hi> belonging to <hi>Garioch</hi> in <hi>Aberdeenſhire,</hi> being the <hi>Scotſman</hi>'s Boaſt; for here <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> tho' ſick, and carried in a Horſe-litter, defeated <hi>John Cummins,</hi> and thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to him, in Favour of <hi>Edward</hi> I. of <hi>England</hi>; who held <hi>Scotland</hi> in Subjection.

            <p>From hence, the Eaſt Shore of <hi>Scotland</hi> being at an End, the Land tends away due Weſt; and the Shire of <hi>Bamff</hi> beginning, you ſee the Towns of <hi>Bamff, Elgin, Frazerſburg,</hi> and the famous Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Kinloſs,</hi> where the murdered Body of King <hi>Duff</hi> was after many Years dug up, and diſcovered to be his by various Tokens.</p>
            <p>The Shire of <hi>Bamff</hi> deſerves ſome Notice for the following Particulars; for that in it is ſituated <hi>Strathyla,</hi> which drives a great Trade in Lime, and fat Cattle; and it abounds ſo with Lime-ſtone, that they build their Houſes with it. They carry on a Trade in fine Linen alſo, by means of their weekly Markets at <hi>Keith,</hi> a neighbouring Village. Upon the Banks of the <hi>Spey,</hi> which runs thro' this County, lies the <hi>Bog of Gicht,</hi> now called <hi>Gordon Caſtle,</hi> the nobleſt Palace in the North, being the Duke of <hi>Gordon</hi>'s chief Seat, adorned with pleaſant Gardens, and a great Park. The Caſtle appears ſo large, that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0141100404:195"/>
it looks more like a Town than a Nobleman's Seat. The Duke is Proprietor of this Part of the County. <hi>Strathave</hi> is the paternal Inheritance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: And his Grace has a fine Eſtate, and other Seats hereabouts. The late Duke had a little embroiled himſelf with the Affairs of 1715, and his Son, then Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> ſtill more; but got off without a Forfeiture, by his Prudence and good Fortune.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Cullen,</hi> an antient Royal Burgh, ſtands in the Shire of <hi>Bamff.</hi> It is chiefly noted for its fruitful Soil, and Salmon-fiſhing; for having no Port, it has little Trade, except for its Corn and Salmon.</p>
            <p>The Shire itſelf takes Name from <hi>Bamff,</hi> a Burgh Royal, ſeated at the Mouth of <hi>Doverne</hi> in the <hi>Boyne,</hi> where the Sheriff holds his Courts. In it are the Ruins of an old Caſtle, near which is the Abbey of <hi>Deer,</hi> formerly belonging to the <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Monks, and founded by <hi>William Cumin,</hi> Earl of <hi>Buchan.</hi> In <hi>Belvenie</hi> is found the Stone of which Alum is made, and in the County of <hi>Boyne</hi> great Quarries of ſpotted Marble have been diſcovered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buchan</hi> is Part in <hi>Aberdeenſhire,</hi> Part in the Shire of <hi>Bamff,</hi> one of its principal Towns is <hi>Frazerſburgh,</hi> and <hi>Peterhead</hi> is another. The latter is a good Market-town, with a Port, and ſmall Harbour with two little Piers for Fiſhing; but being ſo near <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> has not thoſe Helps and Advantages, that might be otherwiſe probably given to it; ſo that at low Water it is all dry, and the ſmalleſt Ships lie aground in it.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Saltoun</hi> has very lately built, (1738) at <hi>Frazerſburgh,</hi> a moſt excellent new Pier and Bulwark, all of Free-ſtone; which renders that Harbour as ſafe and commodious as any on the Eaſt Coaſt; ſo that 30 Ships may winter there at once, with great Safety: The Water at full Sea is 18 or 20 Feet.</p>

            <p>From <hi>Fifeneſs,</hi> which is the Northermoſt Point, on the Mouth of <hi>Edinburgh Firth,</hi> being the Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Land of <hi>Fife</hi> to this Point of <hi>Buchanneſs,</hi> the Land lies almoſt due North and South, and the Shore is the Eaſtermoſt Land of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Diſtance between them is 33 Leagues, 1 Mile, which is juſt 100 Miles; tho' the Mariners ſay, that meaſuring by the Sea, it is but 28; and from <hi>Wintertonneſs,</hi> near <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> to this Point call'd <hi>Buchanneſs,</hi> is juſt 300 Miles.</p>
            <p>The River or <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Tay</hi> opens into the Sea, about four Leagues North from <hi>Fifeneſs</hi>; and as there is a Light-houſe on the <hi>Iſle of May,</hi> as I have ſaid before, in the Mouth of the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Forth</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> a little South of this Point, call'd <hi>Fife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; there are likewiſe two Light-houſes at the Entrance of the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Tay,</hi> for the Directions of the Sailors, when they are bound into that River, and particularly for their avoiding the two Sands, which lie off from the South-ſide of the Entrance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buchanneſs</hi> is generally alſo the firſt Land of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which the Ships make in their Voyages Home from <hi>Archangel</hi> in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> or from their Whale-fiſhing Voyages to <hi>Greenland</hi> and <hi>Spits-bergen</hi> in the North Seas: And near this Point, at <hi>Pitſligo,</hi> a great Ship was caſt away in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, bound Home from <hi>Archangel,</hi> having on board the firſt Embaſſador ſent by the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> to any of the Chriſtian Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> he being commiſſioned to treat with Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for a League of Peace and Commerce. He likewiſe loſt a moſt valuable Preſent, deſigned for the Queen, of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0141100404:197"/>
rich and coſtly Furrs, in thoſe Days, reputed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable. The Embaſſador was happily ſaved, and brought on Shore by the People of <hi>Pitſligo</hi>; but the Ship and all the Goods were loſt.</p>
            <p>From this Point of Eaſterly Land all that great Bay, or Inlet of the Sea, reaching quite to the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is called <hi>Murray Firth,</hi> and the Northermoſt Point is <hi>Dungsby-head,</hi> which is the North-eaſt Point of <hi>Caithneſs,</hi> and opens to <hi>Pentland Firth.</hi> By <hi>Pentland Firth</hi> you are to underſtand the Paſſage of the Sea beyond <hi>Caithneſs,</hi> between <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the Iſles of <hi>Orkney.</hi> What is call'd <hi>Murray Firth,</hi> is not, like many others, the Mouth of a River, as that of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> or <hi>Tay,</hi> but is an open Bay in the Sea, as the Bay of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> or the Gulph of <hi>Mexico</hi> are; and reaches, as I have ſaid, from <hi>Peters-head,</hi> to <hi>Dungsby-head,</hi> oppoſite to the <hi>Orkneys,</hi> the Diſtance of 79 Miles; but it is almoſt twice as far by Land, becauſe of the Depth of that Bay, which obliges us to travel from <hi>Pitſligo</hi> Weſt, near 70 Miles, till we come to <hi>Inverneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This County of <hi>Buchan</hi> is more to be taken Notice of from what is to be ſeen on the Sea Shore than in the Land; for the Country is moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, and in ſome Places not very fertile; but as we coaſted along Weſt, we came into a much better Country, particularly the Shires of <hi>Bamff,</hi> which I have already mention'd, <hi>Elgin,</hi> and the County of <hi>Murray,</hi> from whence the Bay I juſt now deſcribed, is called <hi>Murray Firth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Murray</hi> is a pleaſant Country, the Soil fruitful, water'd with fine Rivers, and full of good Towns, and Gentlemens Seats more than could be expected in ſo remote a Part of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This Country is a Plain for between 20 and 30 Miles together, and the Soil is by that means render'd more fruitful and rich, and the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Air more ſoften'd, than in other Parts of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0141100404:198"/>
               <hi>Scotland</hi>; inſomuch that the Harveſt here, and in the Vale of <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> and all the Country to <hi>Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is obſerved to be more early than in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> nay, than in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> and even ſome Parts of the more Southerly Counties in <hi>England</hi>; as particularly in the Eaſt of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex.</hi> As a Confirmation of this, I affirm that I have ſeen the new Wheat of this Country and <hi>Inverneſs</hi> brought to Market to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> before the Wheat at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> has been fit to reap; and yet the Harveſt about <hi>Edinburgh</hi> is thought to be as forward as in moſt Parts, even of <hi>England</hi> itſelf. In a Word, it is uſual in <hi>Murray</hi> and the Country about it, to begin with their Harveſt in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> and it is not very unuſual to have new Corn fully ripe and threſh'd out, ſhipped off, and brought to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to Sale, within the Month of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The River <hi>Loſſie</hi> in this County is famous for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; there being annually pickled and exported from 80 to 100 Laſts, all taken in a few Months of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in a Space of one Mile, at a Village called <hi>Germach.</hi> It abounds with Fiſh to the very Head; but ſtill the greateſt Quantity is uſed for home Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and taken either with hooked Tridents by Day, or Wicker Baſkets, or little Boats covered with Hides, by Night. None but the Natives, who are uſed to them, will venture into thoſe Boats. The common Drink in theſe Parts is Ale, and ſometimes Beer, and they have good <hi>French</hi> Wine very cheap, as I and my Company experienced; but the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants prefer <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> of their own extracting from Ale-dregs and Spices, to much richer Wines than the <hi>French</hi>; of this they drink plentifully themſelves, and are very liberal of it to their Friends. And a Bottle of this Liquor, and ſome Cheeſe, will make a <hi>Murray</hi> Man undertake the greateſt Winter-Journeys, without wiſhing for any other Proviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0141100404:199"/>This County is divided into two Shires; the greater, called the Shire of <hi>Elgin</hi>; the other, the Shire of <hi>Nairn.</hi> The Town of <hi>Nairn</hi> lies on the Mouth of the River of that Name; along which lie the Seats of many Perſons of Quality.</p>
            <p>Near the Caſtle of <hi>Caddel</hi> or <hi>Calder,</hi> on that River, is a Vein of Free-ſtone, and many Signs of Copper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tarnaway</hi> Caſtle, on the River <hi>Findorn,</hi> in this County, is an old Caſtle and Seat belonging to the Earls of <hi>Murray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little lower on the other Side, ſtands the Burgh of <hi>Forreſs,</hi> in an exceeding pleaſant Situation. The Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> formerly reſided here, in a Caſtle that is now gone to Ruin; and lower, formerly, ſtood the noble Abbey of <hi>Kinloſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Road to <hi>Forreſs</hi> is a large Pillar of one Stone, being a Monument of a Victory obtained by King <hi>Malcolm Mac Kenneth</hi> over <hi>Sueno</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi>; the Inſcription is now worn out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this Place and <hi>Elgin,</hi> are numberleſs Seats of the Quality.</p>
            <p>In this rich County, on the River <hi>Loſſie,</hi> which riſes a few Miles above it, and empties itſelf into the Sea a few Miles below it, lies <hi>Elgin,</hi> formerly a Biſhop's See. It is ſituated in a very fruitful Soil, tho' ſomewhat ſandy. The Ruins of the Caſtle are ſtill to be ſeen on the Eaſt End of the Town; tho' demoliſh'd ſo long ago, as the Wars of the <hi>Danes.</hi> There was a noble Cathedral here, which for Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Splendor, Magnificence and Workmanſhip, had hardly its Equal in the Kingdom. The uſual Place of Reſidence of the Biſhop was at the Caſtle of <hi>Spynie,</hi> within a Mile of the Town, a very noble Seat, with fine Gardens and Woods.</p>
            <p>But tho' the Town of <hi>Elgin</hi> has Reaſon to be proud of its Situation, it was not very rich in its Town Revenues; for it had long laboured under
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0141100404:200"/>
heavy and burdenſome Debts; which being increaſed by the Rebellion in 1715. put a Stop to divers of its new publick Works, and made ſeveral others run into Decay. At the ſame time the River <hi>Loſſie</hi> having very inſufficient Banks, the Chanel of it became choaked with Sand, which made it ſubject to overflow; and moreover, the Harbour of <hi>Loſſie</hi> itſelf, which may be called the Port of <hi>Elgin,</hi> lying not far from it, became ruinous and decayed, to the great Prejudice of Perſons trading in the <hi>Murray</hi> Firth, as well as to the Town. For all theſe Reaſons, and in order to inlarge and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, as well as repair, the ſaid Harbour of <hi>Loſſie,</hi> an Act paſſed in the Year 1721, laying a Duty of Two-penies <hi>Scots</hi> on every <hi>Scots</hi> Pint of Ale or Beer, that ſhould be vended within the ſaid Town and its Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo that it bids fair to make as flouriſhing a Figure as it has done for Centuries paſt.</p>
            <p>Above <hi>Elgin, Forreſs</hi> and <hi>Nairn,</hi> lies that Part of the Country called, <hi>The Bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Murray,</hi> no way comparable to the lower Part for Fruitfulneſs; and beyond this are Mountains, Woods, and green Valleys; particularly <hi>Strathherin,</hi> well inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and abounding with little Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and <hi>Strathnairn,</hi> a ſtill better Soil, and poſſeſſed by ſeveral Gentlemen. <hi>Strathherin</hi> alſo abounds with Lakes, Mountains and Streams.</p>
            <p>In this County lies <hi>Lochmoy,</hi> with an Iſland, where the Laird of <hi>Mackintoſh</hi> (a Name well known in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as well as <hi>Scotland,</hi> by means of the famous Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier of that Name, who was taken Priſoner at the Battle of <hi>Preſton,</hi> eſcaped out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and lately died in Peace in <hi>Scotland</hi>) has his Seat. This Tribe is called <hi>Clan Chattau</hi>; and are numerous in this County.</p>
            <p>But to ſay a few Words more of <hi>Elgin,</hi> before we leave this County: Gentlemen of all Parties and Opinions, as if this Town was the Court for this Part of the Iſland, leave their Highland Habitations in the Winter, and come to live at <hi>Elgin,</hi> with very
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0141100404:201"/>
engaging Freedom; ſo that it is a Place of greater Reſort than could be imagined, at the Diſtance of 450 meaſured Miles from <hi>London,</hi> and more, if we muſt go by <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This rich Country continues with very little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, till we come to <hi>Strathnairn,</hi> or the Valley of <hi>Nairn,</hi> where it extends a little farther in Breadth towards the Mountains, and is not inferior to the other in Fruitfulneſs: From the weſtern Part of this County you may obſerve that the Land goes away again to the North; and, as if you were to enter into another Iſland beyond <hi>Britain,</hi> you find a large Lake or Inlet from the Sea of <hi>Murray,</hi> going on Weſt, as if it were to cut through the Iſland; for we could ſee no End of it, nor could ſome of the Country-people tell us how far it reached, but that it went beyond <hi>Lochaber:</hi> So that we thought, till our Maps and further Inquiſition informed us, it had joined the Weſtern Ocean.</p>
            <p>After we had travelled about twelve Miles, and deſcended from a riſing Ground, upon which we then were; we perceived the Lake contracted in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Place to the ordinary Size of a River, as if deſigned by Nature to give Paſſage to the Inhabitants to converſe with the Northern Part; and then it opened again to its former Breadth, and continued in the Form of a large Lake, as before, for many more Miles than we could ſee; being in the Whole, according to Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> 23 Miles long; but if it be taken on both Sides the Paſs, 'tis above 35 Miles in Length.</p>
            <p>This Situation muſt neceſſarily make the narrow Part a moſt important Paſs, from the more Southerly Parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Northern Countries, which are beyond it. We have been told, the <hi>Romans</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conquered thus far, and the Conqueſts of <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> have been much magnified on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but if what Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> records, and is confirmed by other Accounts from the Men of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0141100404:202"/>
Learning and Obſervation, be true, this muſt be a Miſtake; for we are told, that near <hi>Bean</hi> Caſtle in the County of <hi>Nairn,</hi> there was found, in the Year 1406. a fine Marble Veſſel curiouſly carved, which was full of <hi>Roman</hi> Coins of ſeveral Sorts; alſo ſeveral old Forts or Mounts have been ſeen here, which, by their Remains, evidently ſhewed themſelves to be <hi>Roman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now entered the Shire of <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> abounding with large Woods of Firr and Oak, and having in it ſome Iron Mines. It contains <hi>Badenock, Locha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and the South and Weſt Parts of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Sky</hi>; of all which I ſhall ſpeak, as they offer in the Courſe I took.</p>
            <p>In the narrow Paſs mentioned above, over the Lake ſtands the Town and Fortreſs of <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> that is, a Town on the inner Bank of the River <hi>Neſs.</hi> The Situation of it (as I have ſaid before) intimates, that it is a Place of Strength; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it has a Caſtle, founded in antient Times to command the Paſs: And ſome Authors write, that it was antiently a Royal Houſe for the Kings of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Be that as it will, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> thought it a Place of ſuch Importance, that he built a ſtrong Citadel here, and kept a ſtated Gariſon always in it, and ſometimes more than a Gariſon; finding it needful to have a large Body of his old veteran Troops poſted here to preſerve the Peace of the Country, and keep the <hi>Highlanders</hi> in Awe, which they did effectually all his Time.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved, that at the End of thoſe troubleſome Days, when the Troops on all Sides came to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, and the Men diſperſed, abundance of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Soldiers ſettled in this fruitful Part of the Country, from whence it received two Advantages:
<list>
                  <item>1. They learnt the Art of Huſbandry in full Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which they did not underſtand before; which, with the Help of a rich Soil, has rendered this Part
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0141100404:203"/>
of the Country more fruitful than the reſt of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to this Day. And to this it is in ſome meaſure owing, that the Harveſt is ſo early, and the Corn ſo good, as is obſerved above.</item>
                  <item>2. As <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Soldiers initiated them thus into the Arts and Induſtry of the Huſbandman, ſo they left them the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Accent upon their Tongues, which they likewiſe preſerve to this Day; for they ſpeak perfect <hi>Engliſh,</hi> even much better than in the moſt Southerly Provinces of <hi>Scotland</hi>; nay, ſome will ſay, as well as at <hi>London</hi> itſelf.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Their Tongue is not only <hi>Angliciſed,</hi> but their Palates too; their Way of Eating and Cookery, Dreſs and Behaviour, is according to the Southern Mode: I wiſh they do not, in time, degenerate into Luxury, and forget that military Original which firſt reformed them.</p>
            <p>The Fort which was then built, and afterwards demoliſhed, has been reſtored ſince the Revolution, and a Gariſon was always kept here by King <hi>William,</hi> for the better regulating the <hi>Highlands</hi>; which Poſt was of ſingular Importance in the Time of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Earl of <hi>Marr</hi> for the <hi>Pretender</hi>; when, tho' his Party took it, they were driven out again by the Country with the Aſſiſtance of the Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> and ſeveral other of the Nobility and Gentry, who ſtood faſt to the King's Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inverneſs</hi> may be ſaid to be a pleaſant, clean, and well-built Town. There are ſome Merchants in it, and it has a good Share of Trade. In it the Sheriff keeps his Court. It conſiſts of two large handſome Streets, and has a ſtately Stone Bridge of ſeven large Arches over the River <hi>Neſs,</hi> where (as I ſaid before) it grows narrow between the Sea and the Lake. The Water of this River is almoſt always warm, and all the Year long is never ſo cold as to freeze; nay, in the ſharpeſt Winter, if Cakes of Ice are thrown into it, they will be quickly thaw'd by its
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0141100404:204"/>
Warmth. Small Veſſels may come up to the Town; but larger Ships, which often come thither for Corn, are forced to lie at ſome Diſtance Eaſt from it.</p>
            <p>But it has been lately improved, and is ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improving; for in the Year 1718 an Act paſſed, for laying a Duty of a Sixth of a Peny Sterling on every Pint of Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſold within the Town and its Privileges, for building a Church and making a Harbour there. The Preamble to the Act, giving a Deſcription of the Place, and the Reaſons of applying for it, I ſhall inſert, and is to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Effect:</p>
            <p>That the Town of <hi>Inverneſs</hi> is ſituate near the Sea, and very capable of Improvements in its Trade and Commerce, and having but a very ſmall publick Revenue, incumbered with Debts, and thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the Expence the Inhabitants were at in oppoſing the Rebellion of 1715. And the Church of the ſaid Town, beſide, being ruinous, was not large enough to contain the Inhabitants; for the effecting of theſe good Purpoſes the ſaid Act was paſſed.</p>
            <p>This Act was to be in Force for 19 Years only; and the firſt five Years it produced ſo well, that the Magiſtrates of <hi>Inverneſs</hi> entered upon a Deſign greatly to inlarge and improve their Harbour; in order to which they purchaſed Grounds, rented Quarries, built Boats for tranſporting Stone, deepened their Harbour, erected Bulwarks and Quays; ſo that it was made much more commodious than ever: But the next 13 Years the Produce of the Duties was ſo low, occaſioned by the exceſſive Uſe of run Tea and Brandy, which People could buy ſo cheap, that the Conſumption of Beer and Ale was greatly leſſened, and they having run much behind-hand, were forced to apply for a further Continuation of the Act; and accordingly, in the 11th Year of King <hi>George</hi> II. an Act paſſed for continuing the ſame for
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0141100404:205"/>
21 Years more, for paying the Debts contracted, and effecting the other good Purpoſes I have mentioned. Which, when done, will make <hi>Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> a Place of as great Account as any in the North of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we are over the Bridge of <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> you enter that which we truly call the North of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and others the North <hi>Highlands</hi>; in which are ſeveral diſtinct Shires, but cannot call for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Deſcription, becauſe they are all one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed Range of Mountains and Woods, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with vaſt and almoſt uninhabited Rocks and Steeps filled with Deer innumerable of various Kinds; among which are ſome of thoſe the Antients called <hi>Harts</hi> and <hi>Roebucks,</hi> with over-grown Stags and Hinds of the Red-deer Kind.</p>
            <p>Before I deſcribe this frightful Country, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that <hi>Scotland</hi> may be divided into four Diſtricts, which I have not ſeen any of our Geographers do before me; yet, I believe, may not be an improper Meaſurement for ſuch as would form a due Idea of the Whole in their Minds.

One ſort of Bird is peculiar to this Country, called <hi>Knug,</hi> which reſembles a Parrot, and digs its Neſt in the Trunks of Oak, with its Beak. There are about 60 Lakes in this County: The greateſt is <hi>Lochſkin,</hi> 14 Miles in Length; in many of them are Iſlands very pleaſant for Summer Habitations. In the Iſle of <hi>Brora,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Sutherland</hi> has a Houſe, which he makes uſe of when he comes to hunt Deer, which abound in it; and in ſome of the Lakes and Rivers of this County, as well as in the Rivers of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and <hi>Roſſe,</hi> are found Pearls of great Value. In ſhort, this Shire ſo abounds with Lakes, Rivers, and Bays, that there is ſcarce a Farm in the whole County,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0141100404:207"/>
but is waſhed either with freſh or ſalt Water, ſo that the Inhabitants have Store of Fiſh and Fowl. The Beer or Big in this County is reckoned excellent. It has alſo Silver Mines, and excellent Iron Mines, Coal Mines, and Quarries of Free-ſtone, but much neglected. It has many commodious Harbours for Ships to export its Commodities; which are Cod, Salmon, ſalt Beef, Wool, Skins, Hides, Tallow, Butter, Cheeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Bays and Coaſts alſo abound with Seals, have ſometimes Whales, and Shell Fiſh of all ſorts.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Sutherland</hi> has a Caſtle beyond <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs,</hi> called <hi>Dunrobin,</hi> ſituate on the Eaſtern Shore, of which his Lordſhip was ſent down by Sea to take an early Poſſeſſion in the late Rebellion; and which if he had not done, would ſoon have fallen into the Hands of the late Earl of <hi>Marr</hi>'s Party; but his coming timely thither, prevented him and the Country on that Side, from joining the Troops of the <hi>Pretender.</hi> In the Gardens of this Seat, tho' ſo Northerly, Saffron grows very well, and comes to Maturity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strathnavern</hi> is Part of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> and derives its Name from <hi>Strath,</hi> a Valley, ſituated on the River <hi>Navern,</hi> which runs thro' it. The Country is moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, and formerly was noted for breeding greater Numbers of ravenous Wolves than any other in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Bays and Rivers are full of Fiſh; it is very woody, and many Lakes are in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys. There are ſeveral Monuments in it, of Victories gained over the <hi>Danes,</hi> particularly one at <hi>Enbo,</hi> which is a Stone Croſs, ſaid to be over a <hi>Daniſh</hi> King. The Inhabitants are great Hunters, and deſpiſe thoſe who are not; ſo that Veniſon with them is a common Diſh. The Situation of the Country not admitting of Towns, the Inhabitants live up and down in ſmall Villages. On the Northern Coaſt of this County are ſeveral Iſlands.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0141100404:208"/>
Of the many Lakes, <hi>Lochnavern</hi> and <hi>Lochyol</hi> are the largeſt, and the latter affords an Iſland which is inhabited in the Summer time. <hi>Borwe</hi> and <hi>Young,</hi> are the Places of moſt Note, the latter the principal Seat of the Lord <hi>Rea,</hi> Chief of the <hi>Mackays,</hi> who is the principal Proprietor of <hi>Strathnavern</hi>; but holds it of the Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> to whoſe eldeſt Son it gives the Title of Lord. The Earls of <hi>Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were formerly of the Name of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> to the Heireſs of which a Son of the Houſe of <hi>Gordon</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, from whom the preſent Earl is deſcended. They have a long time claimed Precedency, as the firſt Earls of the Kingdom, and in order to recover it, have re-aſſumed their former Name. They have great Royalties, as being Admirals of that, and ſome of the neighbouring Counties, and all the Gentlemen of <hi>Sutherland</hi> hold of them. Lord <hi>Duffus</hi> is deſcended of this Family. The Earl is Hereditary Sheriff of it. The County has ſeveral Mountains of white Marble, as we were told.</p>
            <p>North of the Mouth of the River <hi>Neſſe,</hi> is the famous <hi>Cromarty</hi> Bay, or <hi>Cromarty</hi> Firth, noted for being the fineſt Harbour, with the leaſt Buſineſs, perhaps, of any in <hi>Britain.</hi> It is 15 Miles long, and in many Places two Miles broad; and, like <hi>Milford-haven</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> is able to receive the Royal Navy of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> both to go out and come in with Safety; but, for want of Trade, this noble Harbour, which by Geographers and Mariners, is called <hi>Portus Salutis,</hi> or <hi>the Harbour of Safety,</hi> is become almoſt uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>The Shire of <hi>Cromarty</hi> is denominated from a Royal Burgh, ſtanding upon the Firth of <hi>Cromarty.</hi> The Waters of <hi>Connel</hi> are celebrated for the Pearls found in them. Of great Part of this County the Earl of <hi>Cromarty</hi> is Sheriff and Proprietor. The Straths or Valleys upon the Water-ſide abound with Woods. Particularly, upon the Hills is great
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0141100404:209"/>
Store of all ſorts of Game; alſo near <hi>Alſerig,</hi> upon the Waters of <hi>Braan,</hi> and on the <hi>Carron,</hi> are great Woods of Fir.</p>
            <p>All the County beyond the River <hi>Neſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Loch</hi> flowing into it, is called <hi>Caithneſs,</hi> and extends to the Northermoſt Land in <hi>Scotland.</hi> It is divided from <hi>Sutherland</hi> by the Mountain <hi>Ord,</hi> and a Tract of Mountains running from it as far as <hi>Knochfin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some People tell us they have Lead, Copper, and Iron in this Part of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and I am very much inclined to believe it; but it ſeems reſerved for a future and more induſtrious Age to ſearch into it. Should a Time come, when theſe hidden Treaſures of the Earth ſhall be diſcovered and improved, this Part of <hi>Scotland</hi> would be no longer eſteemed poor; for ſuch a Production would ſoon change the Face of Things, bring Wealth and Commerce to it, fill the Harbours with Ships, the Towns with People, and by conſuming the Proviſions, occaſion the Soil to be cultivated, the Fiſh cured, the Cattle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed at Home, and thereby diffuſe Proſperity all around them.</p>
            <p>Our Writers have repreſented the Inhabitants here wild and barbarous: They were ſo formerly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps; but we ſee the <hi>Mackenzies, Macleods, Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, M<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Leans, M<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Donalds, Gordons, M<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Keys, Macferguſons, M<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Intoſhes,</hi> and others ſprung from thence, equally accompliſhed for the Court or Camp.</p>
            <p>It muſt be owned, here are but few Towns; the People live diſperſed in Clans under a kind of Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalage, ſubmitting to their Lords as their lawful Monarchs, and many of them acknowledge no other; tho' this too, is in a manner got over, and the Clans are leſs dependent on their Chiefs, than they uſed to be, by virtue of an Act of Parliament made for that very Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Their Employment is chiefly Hunting for their Food, tho' they alſo breed large Quantities of Black
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0141100404:210"/>
Cattle, with which they pay their Lairds or Leaders the Rent of the Lands. Theſe Cattle are driven annually to <hi>England</hi> to be ſold, and are bought up chiefly in the Counties of <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi>; as I have mentioned in ſeveral Places in my <hi>Tour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many little Towns and Villages, beſides Gentlemens Seats in <hi>Caithneſs,</hi> as far North as it is: But the People are more addicted to good Living within Doors, than to ſhewy Edifices, or fine Seats. The beſt Houſe in it, is Caſtle <hi>Sinclair,</hi> ſo called from the Name of the Earls of <hi>Sinclair,</hi> whoſe Seat it is, and they have ſeveral other Caſtles in the County. The Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi> of <hi>Ravenſheugh</hi> in <hi>Fife</hi> is chief of the Name. His Anceſtors formerly poſſeſſed <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Shetland,</hi> and were allied to the Royal Family of <hi>Denmark.</hi> But one of the Family ſquandered away his Eſtate, and among the reſt, theſe Iſlands; and got for it the inglorious Title of, <hi>William the Waſter.</hi> The chief Town and Royal Burgh in <hi>Caithneſs</hi> is <hi>Wick</hi> or <hi>Weich,</hi> whence it is called the Shire of <hi>Weich.</hi> This Town lies conveniently for Trade, and has a good Harbour for Ships on the Eaſtern Coaſt. It is the Reſidence of the Sheriff, or his Officer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſo,</hi> another Town with a good Harbour, lies alſo on the Northern Coaſt, in a little Bay. The Iſles of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Shetland,</hi> I refer to the Account of the Iſles.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall obſerve, once for all, that I am the more particular in my Deſcription of theſe Northern Parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe they are leaſt known, and leſs valued and eſteemed than they deſerve.</p>
            <p>This County is ſurrounded with the Sea, and thoſe two great Inlets of Water, mentioned above, called the <hi>Neſs</hi> and the <hi>Abre:</hi> So that it forms a Peninſula, by means of that ſmall Neck of Land of about eight Miles long, which Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> calls the <hi>Garrow</hi> or <hi>Glengarrough,</hi> others <hi>Glengary.</hi> Were
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0141100404:211"/>
it not for this, the whole Diviſion of the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would be a diſtinct Iſland, ſeparated from all the reſt of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as effectually as the <hi>Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi> or the Iſle of <hi>Skye</hi> is from this.</p>
            <p>That Part which lies to the Eaſt, is open to the Sea, without Cover; the Weſt and the North are, in a manner, ſurrounded with Out-works as a Defence to break off the raging Ocean from the North; for the Weſtern Iſlands on one Side, and the <hi>Orkneys</hi> on the other, lie as ſo many advanced Fortifications or Redoubts, to combat that Enemy at a Diſtance.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Dunrobin</hi> Caſtle you have nothing of Note offers itſelf, either by Sea or Land, but an extended Shore lying North and South, without Towns, and without Harbours; and as there are none of the former to be found, ſo there are none of the laſt wanting.</p>
            <p>The Land thus extended lies North and South to <hi>Dungſby-head,</hi> which is the utmoſt Extent of it, on the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Britain</hi> North, and is diſtant from <hi>Cromarty</hi> 18 Leagues North. From this Point of <hi>Dingſby</hi> or <hi>Dungſby-head,</hi> as I obſerved before of <hi>Buchan</hi> and <hi>Winterton,</hi> the Sailors take their Diſtances, and keep their Accounts in their going farther North; <hi>e. g.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Point of <hi>Dingſby-head</hi> to the <hi>Fair-iſle</hi> or <hi>Faro,</hi> which is the firſt of <hi>Shetland,</hi> or the laſt of the <hi>Orkneys,</hi> (call it which you will; for it lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both) is 25 Leagues, or 75 Miles.</p>
            <p>From the ſame <hi>Dungſby-head</hi> to <hi>Sumburgh-head,</hi> that is, to <hi>Shetland,</hi> is 32 Leagues, or 96 Miles, and to <hi>Lerwick</hi> Fort in <hi>Shetland</hi> 110 Miles.</p>
            <p>Thus from <hi>Buchanneſs</hi> to <hi>Sumburgh-head</hi> in <hi>Shet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is 47 Leagues.</p>
            <p>And from <hi>Wintertonneſs</hi> near <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to <hi>Buchanneſs,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> is juſt 100 Leagues. So from <hi>Winterton</hi> to <hi>Shetland</hi> is 147 Leagues, or 431 Miles.</p>
            <p>I am now to obſerve, that we are here at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt Point of the Iſland of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0141100404:212"/>
that here the Land bears away Weſt, leaving a large Streight or Sea, which they call <hi>Pictland,</hi> or <hi>Pentland Firth,</hi> and which divides between the Iſland of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the Iſles of the <hi>Orkneys</hi>; a Paſſage broad and fair; for 'tis not leſs than five Leagues over, and has a ſufficient Depth of Water for Ships to ſail in: But the Tides are ſo fierce, ſo uncertain, and the Guſts and ſudden Squalls of Wind ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that very few Merchant Ships care to venture thro' it, and the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Ships, which come North about, (as 'tis called) in their Return from <hi>India,</hi> keep all farther off, and chuſe to come by <hi>Fair-iſle,</hi> in the Paſſage between the Iſlands of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Shetland</hi>; whither they generally ſend their Men of War to meet them, being ſure of not miſſing them in ſo narrow a Paſſage.</p>
            <p>But the Paſſage here is much broader, being at leaſt nine Leagues from North <hi>Ranalſha,</hi> the fartheſt Iſland of the <hi>Orkneys,</hi> to <hi>Fair-iſle,</hi> and five more from <hi>Fair-iſle</hi> to <hi>Shetland:</hi> So that it is 14 Leagues clear open Sea between the <hi>Orkneys</hi> and <hi>Shetland,</hi> with only a ſmall Iſland in the Way, which has nothing dangerous about it.</p>
            <p>In the Paſſage between the Land's End of <hi>Britain</hi> and the <hi>Orkneys,</hi> is a ſmall Iſland, which our Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners call <hi>Stroma,</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> and others, <hi>Sowna</hi>; and is much ſpoken of as dangerous for Ships: But I ſee no room to record any thing of that kind, any more than the Report, that it is haunted by Witches and Spirits, which draw Ships on Shore to their Misfortune.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Dungſby-head</hi> is the moſt Northerly Land of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> where, in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> after a clear Day, we could ſee to read the ſmalleſt Print, and to write diſtinctly, all Night long, without the Help of a Candle.</p>
            <p>No wonder the antient Mariners, be they <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician</hi> or <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> who knew nothing of the Motion of the heavenly Bodies, when they were
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0141100404:213"/>
driven thus far, were ſurpriſed to find they had loſt the ſteady Rotation of Day and Night, which they thought had ſpread over the whole Globe. They imagined the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields muſt lie this Way, when they found they were come already to the Realm of everlaſting Day.</p>
            <p>From hence Weſt we go along the Shore of the <hi>Firth,</hi> which they call <hi>Pentland,</hi> where is the famous Houſe called <hi>John a Grot</hi>'s. We ſet our Horſes Feet into the Sea, on the moſt Northerly Land, as the People ſay, of <hi>Britain,</hi> tho', I think, <hi>Dungſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> is as far North. 'Tis certain, however, the Difference is but very ſmall, being either of them in the Latitude of 59⅙ North, and <hi>Shetland</hi> reaching above two Degrees farther. The Dominions of <hi>Great Britain</hi> are extended from the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> in the Latitude of 50 Degrees, to the Iſles of <hi>Unſta</hi> in <hi>Shetland,</hi> in the Latitude of 61 Degrees 30 Minutes, being 10 Degrees, or full 600 Miles, in Length; which Iſland of <hi>Unſt</hi> or <hi>Unſta,</hi> being the moſt remote of the Iſles of <hi>Shetland</hi> to the North-eaſt, lies 167 Leagues from <hi>Wintertonneſs</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we found, however mountainous and wild the Country appeared, the People extremely well furniſhed with Proviſions, eſpecially four Sorts in great Plenty; two of them ſufficient for a common Table, the other two the Splendor of the greateſt
<list>
                  <item>1. Very good Bread, as well Oat Bread as Wheat, tho' the laſt not ſo cheap as the firſt.</item>
                  <item>2. Veniſon exceeding plentiful, and at all Seaſons, young or old, which they kill with their Guns where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they find it, for there is no Reſtraint; on which Account all the Highlanders have Fire-arms, and become excellent Markſmen.</item>
                  <item>3. Salmon in ſuch Plenty as is ſcarce credible, and conſequently ſo cheap, that to thoſe who have any Subſtance to buy with, it is not worth giving
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0141100404:214"/>
themſelves any Trouble to catch it. This they eat freſh in the Seaſon, and at other times cured by being dried in the Sun, and ſo preſerved all the Year.</item>
                  <item>4. They have no want of Cows and Sheep, but the latter are ſo wild, that ſometimes, were they not, by their own Diſpoſition, uſed to flock together, they would be much harder to kill than the Deer.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>From hence to the Weſt Point of the Paſſage to <hi>Orkney</hi> is near 20 Miles, which may be called the End of the Iſland of <hi>Britain,</hi> which faces directly to the North Pole, ſo that the Tail of the <hi>Great Bear</hi> is ſeen juſt over your Head. The Day is here, in Summer, ſaid to be 18 Hours long, the Sun remaining ſo long above the Horizon; and when he is ſet, he makes ſo ſmall an Arch of a Circle below the Horizon, that it is much above a Twilight all the Night; but it muſt be remembered, that the dark Nights take in Winter their Turn, and are protracted to as great a Degree.</p>
            <p>Yet it is obſervable here, that they have more temperate Winters, generally ſpeaking, than we have in the moſt Southerly Part of the Iſland; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the Water in ſome of the Rivers, as in the <hi>Neſs,</hi> for Example, never freezes (as I have obſerved before); which is accounted for from the Nearneſs of the Sea, which filling the Air with ſalt Vapours, ſheathes, as it were, the acute Particles of the Cold.</p>
            <p>For the ſame Reaſon the Snows are not ſo deep, nor do they lie ſo long upon the Ground, as in other Places. The Summits indeed of the high Hills, whither theſe Vapours cannot reach, are continually covered with Snow, and perhaps have been ſo for many Ages, ſo that this Country, if any in the World, agrees with the following Deſcription:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>— Vaſt wat'ry Lakes, which ſpread below,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And Mountains cover'd with eternal Snow.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0141100404:215"/>On the moſt inland Parts of this Country, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Shire of <hi>Roſs,</hi> they have vaſt Woods of Fir-trees for 15 or 20 Miles in Length, not planted by Mens Hands, as I have deſcribed in the Southern Part of <hi>Scotland</hi>; but as they came out of the Hands of Nature, and nouriſhed by her Hand-maid, Time. If we may believe the Inhabitants, they are large enough to make Maſts for the biggeſt Ships; and yet are of no Service, merely for want of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Water-carriage to bring them away. But methinks, rather than they ſhould remain an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Burden to the Earth, they might be cut down and burnt, from whence might be drawn vaſt Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Pitch, Tar, Roſin, Turpentine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is of eaſier Carriage, and would well anſwer the Trouble. Indeed an Attempt has been made of this kind for Pot-aſh; but it did not ſucceed, rather thro' the Fault of the Undertakers at <hi>London,</hi> than any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>And now leaving the Northern Proſpect, we paſs the oppoſite Point Weſt from <hi>Dungſby-head,</hi> and which the People call <hi>Farro-head,</hi> tho' Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> calls theſe two Points by two different Names: The Eaſt Point, or <hi>Dungſby-head,</hi> he calls <hi>Virvedrum Promontorium.</hi> The Weſt Point, or <hi>Farro-head,</hi> he calls <hi>Sarvedrum Promontorium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence the vaſt Weſtern <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean appears, for which the Geographers have not agreed upon a Name, there being no Country to derive it from.</p>
            <p>And now we were to turn our Faces South; for as to the Iſlands of this Sea, which make the fourth Diviſion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I mentioned before, I ſhall take notice of them under one Head, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of my <hi>Tour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our Attempt to come down to the Southward by the Coaſt of <hi>Tayne,</hi> and the Shire of <hi>Roſs,</hi> we ſhould have been extremely diſappointed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0141100404:216"/>
have been obliged to get a Ship or Bark, to have carried us round the Iſle of <hi>Skye</hi> into <hi>Locha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> had it not been for the extraordinary Courteſy of ſome of the Gentlemen of the Country.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, we unexpectedly met here ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, who were employ'd by Merchants in the South, to take and cure a large Quantity of White-fiſh, and afterwards of Herrings, on account of Trade. Here we had not only the Civility of their Aſſiſtance and Accommodation in our Journey, but the Pleaſure of ſeeing what Progreſs they made in their Undertaking.</p>
            <p>As for the Herrings, the Quantity of them was prodigious. The Shoal was beginning to come, when we firſt came to the Head of <hi>Pentland Firth</hi>; and in a Fortnight's time, the Body of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Shoals began to appear; but before we left the Coaſt, you would have ventur'd to ſay of the Sea, as they do of the River <hi>Tibiſcus,</hi> or <hi>Thieſſe</hi> in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> that it was one third Water, and two thirds Fiſh. The Operation of taking them could hardly be called Fiſhing; for they did little more than dip for them into the Water, and take them up. I make no Scruple to ſay, that if there had been 10,000 Ships to have loaded with them, they might all have been filled. The Fiſh did not ſeem to ſtay, but paſſed on to the South, that they might ſupply other Parts, and make way alſo for thoſe innumerable Shoals which were to come after.</p>
            <p>Had the Quantity of White-fiſh been any way proportioned to the Herrings, there would, no doubt, have been ſuch Encouragement to the Merchants, that they would never have given it over; but they found it would not fully anſwer: Not but that there were great Quantities of Cod, and the Fiſh were ſize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and good; but as they are taken with Hook and Line, they could not with any Diſpatch get a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0141100404:217"/>
Loading, or lay up enough in large Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Seaſon.</p>
            <p>The Bay of <hi>Tayne</hi> is unſafe for Ships, runs a great way up into the County, divides <hi>Roſſe</hi> from <hi>Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ends at the Promontory of <hi>Tarbat.</hi> We found the Town of <hi>Tayne,</hi> and ſome other Villages, tolerably well inhabited, and ſome Trade alſo, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned principally by the Communication with the Weſtern Iſlands, and alſo by the Herring-fiſhing, the Fiſhing-boats from other Parts often putting into thoſe Ports; for all their Coaſt is full of Loughs and Rivers, and other Openings, which make very good Harbours for Shipping; and what is remarkable, ſome of thoſe Loughs are infinitely full of Herrings, even where, as they tell us, they have no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the Sea, ſo that they muſt have, in all Probability, been put into them alive by ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hands, and have multiplied there, as we find at this Time, if they have not ſome Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations with the Sea, which are not diſcovered to the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>We could underſtand no more of what the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple commonly ſaid on this Side, than if we had been in <hi>Morocco</hi>; all the Remedy we had was, that we found moſt of the Gentlemen ſpoke <hi>French,</hi> and ſome few broad <hi>Scotiſh.</hi> It was indeed upon other Accounts much for our Convenience to make the common People believe we were <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should we go about here to give you an Account of the Religion of the People in this Country, it would be an unpleaſant Work, and perhaps ſcarce gain Credit. You would hardly believe, that in a Chriſtian Iſland, as this is ſaid to be, there ſhould be People who know ſo little of the Chriſtian Religion, as not to diſtinguiſh <hi>Sunday</hi> from a common Day of Labour, or the Worſhip of God from an ordinary Meeting for Converſation. I am unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord ſo ungrateful a Truth, which may in time find

Redreſs; but I cannot but ſay that his Majeſty's Gift of 1000<hi>l.</hi> paid annually to the Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for ſending Miniſters or Miſſionaries for the propagating Chriſtian Knowledge in the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> is certainly one of the moſt needful Charities that could have been thought of, and truly worthy of a King; and, if prudently applied, as there is Reaſon to believe it is, may in time diſpel that Cloud of Ignorance that has ſo far overſpread this unhappy Part of the Country. The People have the <hi>Bible</hi> in their own Language, the IRS; and the Miſſionaries are obliged to preach to them, and examine and catechiſe their Children in the IRS Language, ſo that we are not to deſpair of having this Country as well inſtructed in time as other Parts of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Shire of <hi>Tayne,</hi> with the little Shire of <hi>Cromarty,</hi> and part of the Shire of <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the whole Country called <hi>Roſſe.</hi> The firſt Tract towards the South-weſt in the County of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> is <hi>Kintail,</hi> ſeparated from the Iſle of <hi>Skye</hi> by a narrow Firth. Next is a little Track called <hi>Gle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelebeg,</hi> the paternal Eſtate of the Earl of <hi>Seaforth,</hi> whoſe chief Seat is called <hi>Caſtle Ylendoven,</hi> lying in an Iſland of the above-mentioned Firth. Farther North, on the ſame Coaſt, lies <hi>Loch-ew,</hi> with thick Woods, where Iron was formerly made. A little farther North, <hi>Loch-brien</hi> runs into this County, and is remarkable for its noble annual Fiſhery of Herrings.</p>
            <p>The Peninſula which lies betwixt the Bay of <hi>Cromarty</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> is called <hi>Ardmeanach,</hi> upon the Shore of which ſtands the Town called, <hi>the Chanonry of Roſs,</hi> formerly a Biſhop's See. It is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſituated in a Valley betwixt fruitful Hills. It had once a ſtately Cathedral and Caſtle, where the Biſhop dwelt. Here the late Earl of <hi>Seaforth</hi> had a noble Houſe. <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> formerly a pleaſant and rich Abbey, lies near the Mouth of the River
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0141100404:219"/>
               <hi>Farrar,</hi> and is now poſſeſſed by the Lord <hi>Lovat.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Seaforth</hi> had near it a Caſtle called <hi>Kildun.</hi> There are other Seats of antient Families in this County, which my Compaſs will not let me deſcribe, and I ſhall mention them at the latter End of my <hi>Tour,</hi> in a general Liſt, that you may be enabled to form an Idea of the numerous Families of Gentry which <hi>Scotland</hi> produces.</p>
            <p>On this Coaſt is the Iſle of <hi>Skye,</hi> lying from the Weſt-north-weſt, to the Eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the main Iſland, only ſeparated by a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Streight of Water; ſomething like as the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> is ſeparated from the County of <hi>Southampton.</hi> We left this on our Right, and croſſing the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, came, with as little Stay as we could, to the Loughs called <hi>Lochyol,</hi> and <hi>Lochlochy,</hi> which run thro' that large Country called <hi>Lochaber,</hi> that is, <hi>

                  </gap>ver</hi> the Lochs, and which ſome affect to call the River <hi>Aber</hi> or <hi>Abre, i. e.</hi> the Water which, as I ſaid above, aſſiſts, with <hi>Loughneſs,</hi> or <hi>Lochneſs,</hi> to ſeparate the North Land of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the middle Part.</p>
            <p>This is a long and narrow Inlet of the Sea, in Length above 24 Miles, the Depth unknown, which opening from the <hi>Iriſh Sea</hi> South-weſt, meets the River <hi>Abre,</hi> or, as the <hi>Scots</hi> much more properly expreſs it, the Water of <hi>Abre</hi>; for it is rather a large Lake or <hi>Loch</hi> than a River, and receives innumerable ſmall Rivers into it. It riſes in the Mountains of <hi>Roſs,</hi> or of <hi>Glengary,</hi> within five or ſix Miles from the Shore of the <hi>Lochneſs,</hi> or the Water of <hi>Neſs,</hi> which is a long and narrow Lake like itſelf; and as the <hi>Neſs</hi> runs away Eaſt to <hi>Innerneſs,</hi> and ſo into the great Gulph called <hi>Murray Firth,</hi> ſo the <hi>Abre,</hi> becoming preſently a <hi>Loch</hi> or Lake, always goes away more to the Southward, and ſloping South-weſt, runs into the <hi>Iriſh Seas,</hi> as above.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0141100404:220"/>
               <hi>Lochaber</hi> is 50 Miles in a ſtrait Line from <hi>Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochy</hi> to <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> and is one of the moſt barren Countries in <hi>North Britain,</hi> tho' the People have Wood, Goats and Deer in Plenty. <hi>Glenco</hi> is almoſt the only Town in it; noted for the barbarous and inhuman Maſſacre perpetrated there by K. <hi>William</hi>'s Soldiers, quartered in thoſe Parts, and who cut off Men, Women and Children without Mercy. A Maſſacre that made a great Noiſe, and was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally deteſted; and what made it ſtill the more odious was, that the Commander in that bloody Work found Friends enough to ſcreen him from the Inquiry that was attempted to be made into the horrid Fact, in order to find out who gave him his Orders for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lochaber</hi> is noted in Hiſtory for <hi>Banco,</hi> its gallant Thane, about the Year 1050, who was murdered by the Tyrant <hi>Macbeth,</hi> becauſe of a Prophecy, <hi>That his Poſterity ſhould enjoy the Crown for a long Series of Years:</hi> Which accordingly happened; for his Son flying into <hi>Wales,</hi> married the Prince of <hi>North Wales</hi>'s Daughter; by whom he had <hi>Walter,</hi> afterwards Steward of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whom the Royal Family of <hi>Stuart</hi> was deſcended. It was on this Story that our celebrated <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> founded his Tragedy called <hi>Macbeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this Water of <hi>Abre,</hi> juſt at the Entrance of the <hi>Loch,</hi> was antiently a Fort built to curb the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> on either Side, called <hi>Inverlochy.</hi> It was formerly of great Strength, and yet often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians.</hi> And at the Revolution, King <hi>William</hi> cauſed it to be rebuilt, or rather erected a new Fort there, which is called <hi>Caſtle William,</hi> as the Village is <hi>Mary-burgh</hi>; and there is always a good Gariſon kept in it for curbing the <hi>Highlanders.</hi> It is ſo ſituated, that tho' it may indeed be blocked up by Land, and diſtreſſed by a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0141100404:221"/>
Siege, yet, as it is open to the Sea, it may conſtantly receive Supplies by Shipping.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Inverlochy</hi> to <hi>Lochneſs</hi> has General <hi>Wade,</hi> with the moſt commendable Induſtry and Pains, thro' almoſt inacceſſible Mountains, and Moſſes, and Moraſſes, made a moſt convenient Road, which even ſurpaſſes (the County conſider'd) what the <hi>Romans</hi> had done with their ſeveral Military Ways; and ſhews, that the Soldiery might be made uſeful even in Times of Peace, and rather a Benefit than a Burden to the Country; and at the ſame time ſo inure them to Toil, Labour, and Hardineſs, as would render them fitter for their Country's Service in Time of War. To defend this Road from the Rage of the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> and at the ſame time to keep them in Awe, the General built a regular For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, which is called <hi>Fort Auguſtus.</hi> By this means the <hi>Highlands,</hi> which before were inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but by <hi>Highlanders,</hi> who eluded always the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of their Purſuers, are eaſily entered, and traverſed at the Pleaſure of the King's Forces; and even the noted <hi>Rob Roy</hi> himſelf, (ſo famous for his Excurſions and Plunders on the <hi>Lowlands,</hi> and the King's Friends, and who, notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and Rewards iſſued for apprehending him, could never be taken) were he alive, would not be able now to find a Place of Refuge from his Purſuers. And this muſt be in time a great Help to the civilizing of the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> as the Schools eſtabliſhed among them (of which more by-and-by) will be another.</p>
            <p>At this Place we take our Leave of the Third Diviſion, which I call the North Land of <hi>Scotland</hi>; for this Fort, being on the South-ſide of the <hi>Loch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aber,</hi> is therefore called <hi>Innerlochy,</hi> as the other for the like Reaſon was called <hi>Innerneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have nothing now remaining for a full Survey of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the Weſtern Part of the Middle
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0141100404:222"/>
Diviſion of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and this, tho' a large Country, yet affords not an equal Variety with the Eaſtern Part of the ſame Diviſion.</p>
            <p>To traverſe the Remainder of this Country, I muſt begin upon the <hi>Upper Tay,</hi> as we may juſtly call it, where I left off, when I turned away Eaſt; and here we have in eſpecial manner the Countries of <hi>Badenach, Athol</hi> and <hi>Braidalbin:</hi> This is a hilly Country indeed; but as it is water'd by the <hi>Tay,</hi> and many other pleaſant Rivers which fall into it, there are ſeveral fruitful Valleys interſperſed among the Hills; nor are even the <hi>Highlands</hi> themſelves, or the <hi>Highlanders</hi> the Inhabitants, any thing ſo wild, untaught, or untractable, as we have been made to believe, and as are to be found in the North Land Diviſion, that is to ſay, in <hi>Strathnavern, Roſs, Tain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Athol</hi> is Lord, I had almoſt ſaid King, of this Country; and has the greateſt Number of Vaſſals, of any Nobleman in this, or any Part of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late Duke was always an Oppoſer of the Union in the Parliament holden at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for paſſing it into an Act; but he did not carry his Oppoſition to a Height of Tumult and Rebellion. If he had, as ſome were forward to have had him done, he would poſſibly at that time have bid fair to have prevented the Concluſion of it: But the Hour was come, when the Calamities of War, which for ſo many hundred Years had vexed the two Nations, were to have an End; and tho' the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had never leſs Power than then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet the Affair was carried thro' with a high Hand, all the little Tumults and Diſorders of the Rabble, as well at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> as at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and other Places, being timely ſuppreſſed, and others by prudent Management prevented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0141100404:223"/>The Duke has ſeveral fine Seats in this Country; as firſt at <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> upon the <hi>Tay,</hi> which I mentioned before, where there was a Fight between the regular Troops and the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> in the Beginning of the Reign of King <hi>William</hi>; another at <hi>Huntingtour,</hi> in the <hi>Strathern,</hi> or Valley of <hi>Ern,</hi> where the Duke has a fine Park, and great Store of Deer; which may be called his Hunting-ſeat, whither he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times retires for Sport.</p>
            <p>He has another Seat at the Caſtle of <hi>Blair,</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther North, and beyond the <hi>Tay,</hi> on the Edge of <hi>Braidalbin,</hi> upon the Banks of a clear and fine River, which falls into the <hi>Tay</hi> a few Miles lower.</p>
            <p>The Country of <hi>Braidalbin</hi> has not ſo much as a ſingle Village in it of ten Houſes; yet from its <hi>Latin</hi> Name <hi>Albania,</hi> gives oft-times the Title of Duke to ſome of the Royal Family; 'tis ſeated very near the Centre of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is alledged to be the higheſt Ground in it, for that the Rivers which riſe here, are ſaid to run every Way from this Part, ſome into the <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> and ſome into the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Seas.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grampian</hi> Mountains here are ſaid to cut thro' <hi>Scotland.</hi> As the Country is rough and uncultivated, the Inhabitants are a hardy Race of Men, who make excellent Soldiers, when they are liſted abroad in regular and diſciplined Troops; and I muſt add, that they are much civilized from what they were formerly. Theſe Mountains abound with Flocks of Black Cattle, Sheep, Horſes, and Goats. The Beef and Mutton are of a delicious Taſte, and the Wool is valued for its Whiteneſs and Softneſs.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Athol,</hi> tho' he had not (till of late) an Eſtate equal to ſome of the Nobility, yet was Maſter of more of the Superiorities, as they are called here, than many of thoſe who have twice his Eſtate; and I have been told, that he can bring a Body of above 6000 Men together in Arms at very little Warning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0141100404:224"/>The Pomp and Grandeur in which this noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lives, is not to be imitated in <hi>Great Britain</hi>; for he is ſerved like a Prince, and maintains a greater Equipage and Retinue, than five times his Eſtate would ſupport in another Country.</p>
            <p>The Duke has alſo another Seat in <hi>Strathern,</hi> which is called <hi>Tullibardin,</hi> and which gives Title of Marquis to the eldeſt Son of the Houſe of <hi>Athol,</hi> for the Time being. At the lower Part of this Country the River <hi>Ern</hi> falls into the <hi>Tay,</hi> and greatly increaſes its Waters. This River riſes far Weſt, on the Frontiers of the Weſtern <hi>Highlands</hi> near <hi>Glengyl,</hi> and running thro' that pleaſant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try called <hi>Strathern,</hi> falls into <hi>Tay,</hi> below <hi>St. Johnſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent Duke is the only Peer that I know of, that is ſo by Statute, rather than Patent; for his eldeſt Brother, the Marquis of <hi>Tullibardin,</hi> being attainted for his Adherence to the <hi>Pretender,</hi> the Title would of courſe have failed; but that (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Eſtate) it was ſettled by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the ſecond Brother, who is alſo Lord of, or King in, the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> and alſo Lord <hi>Strange</hi> of <hi>Knocking,</hi> to both which he ſucceeded by the Death of his Couſin <hi>James</hi> late Earl of <hi>Derby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after the <hi>Ern</hi> ſhoots forth from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, it ſpreads itſelf into a <hi>Loch,</hi> as moſt of thoſe Rivers do, called <hi>Lochern</hi>; and then runs by <hi>Duplin</hi> Caſtle, the Seat of the Earl of <hi>Kinnoul,</hi> whoſe eldeſt Son is thence called Lord <hi>Duplin.</hi> The preſent Earl of <hi>Kinnoul,</hi> when Lord <hi>Duplin,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> when Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England</hi>; and was, on that Occaſion, made a Peer of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> by the Title of Lord <hi>Hay</hi> of <hi>Peperdon.</hi> His Eſtate here is a very good one, but not attended with Vaſſals and Superiorities, as, I obſerved, the Duke of <hi>Athol</hi>'s is. The ſeveral Owners of this Seat having been pretty
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0141100404:225"/>
much uſed to reſide in it, have adorned it at ſeveral times, each according to his particular Genius. It has lately received a new Decoration, two Wings being added for Offices as well as Ornament.</p>
            <p>The old Building is ſpacious, the Rooms large, and Ceilings lofty, filled with Furniture ſuitable to its outward Magnificence, particularly with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of fine Paintings, ſome of the Royal Family, among which is one of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his Hand, held out to his Son the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> afterwards King <hi>James</hi> VII. which they ſaid he was to have carried to <hi>France.</hi> There is alſo a Statue in Braſs of the ſame King on Horſe-back; a Picture of <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>; another of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Monk,</hi> both from the Life. There is alſo a whole Length of that Earl of <hi>Kinnoul,</hi> who was Lord Chancellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> VI. and King <hi>Charles</hi> I. with ſeveral other Pieces of <hi>Italian</hi> Maſters of great Value.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Duplin</hi> Caſtle is remarkable alſo for the greateſt Defeat the <hi>Scots</hi> ever received from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward Baliol,</hi> whom the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came to aſſiſt. In this Battle fourſcore of the Family of <hi>Lindſay</hi> periſhed, and of the Family of <hi>Hay</hi> ſo many, that the Name had been extinguiſhed, had not the Chief left his Lady with Child.</p>
            <p>From this Place we went to <hi>Brechin</hi> in <hi>Angus,</hi> formerly mentioned, an antient Town with a Caſtle finely ſituated; but the Grandeur of it is loſt; the Family of <hi>Panmure,</hi> to whom it belonged chiefly, having forfeited it in the late Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall mention the Cataract near <hi>Blair Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> on the <hi>Keith,</hi> which empties itſelf into the <hi>Tay,</hi> which makes ſo great a Noiſe among the Rocks, that it ſtuns thoſe who come near it.</p>
            <p>We were now, after a long Mountain-ramble, come down to the <hi>Lowlands,</hi> and into a pleaſant and agreeable Country; but as we had yet another
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0141100404:226"/>
Journey to take Weſtward, we had a like Proſpect of a rude and wild Part of <hi>Scotland</hi> to go thro'.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> may be divided into two Parts, the Weſt <hi>Highlands</hi> and the North <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>; the latter I have ſpoken of at large, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Countries of <hi>Athol, Lochaber, Badenach, Strathſpey, Innerneſs, Roſs, Sutherland,</hi> and <hi>Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navern,</hi> together with the Iſles of <hi>Skye, Lewis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Weſt <hi>Highlands</hi> contain the Shires or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Dunbritton</hi> or <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> alias <hi>Lenox, Bute,</hi> and <hi>Argyll,</hi> which laſt contains the Diſtricts of <hi>Cowal, Knapdale, Lorn</hi> and <hi>Cantyre</hi>; the Iſles of <hi>Mull, Jura, Iſla,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Braidalbin</hi> is ſometimes reckoned a Part of the North, and ſometimes of the Weſt <hi>Highlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Banks of the River <hi>Ern</hi> lies a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Vale, which continues from the <hi>Tay,</hi> quite up to the <hi>Highlands,</hi> called by <hi>Claudian, Glacialis Ierne</hi>; but now, according to the Uſage of <hi>Scotland, Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern,</hi> or the Vale of <hi>Ern.</hi> 'Tis an agreeable Country, has many Gentlemens Seats on both Sides the River; but being near the <hi>Highlands,</hi> has often ſuffered by Depredations in former Times.</p>
            <p>In it are many <hi>Roman</hi> Camps; particularly one at <hi>Ardoch</hi>; beſides a <hi>Roman</hi> Highway, towards <hi>Perth.</hi> Several <hi>Roman</hi> Medals have alſo been found there, and of late two <hi>Tabulae</hi> curiouſly enamelled with a Sepulchral Stone. The <hi>Ochil-hills,</hi> which run along the South Parts of <hi>Perthſhire,</hi> abound with Metals and Minerals; particularly they find good Copper, and <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi>; and at <hi>Glen-lion</hi> they meet with Lead. Here is great Want of Coal; but their excellent Peat, and abundance of Wood, ſupply that Defect.</p>
            <p>The Family of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> whoſe Chief was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for the Royal Cauſe in the late Civil Broils, had a ſtrong Caſtle here called <hi>Kincardin,</hi> which was demoliſhed in thoſe Wars, and is not rebuilt. The
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0141100404:227"/>
Caſtle of <hi>Drummond</hi> is almoſt in the ſame Condition, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>th,</hi> Father and Grandfather of the preſent Earl, were forced into Exile for adhering to the late King <hi>James</hi> II. and the <hi>Pretender.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> had the latter in ſuch Eſteem, that he not only made him a Duke, and Knight of the Garter, but Governor to the <hi>Chevalier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Weſtern <hi>Highlands,</hi> properly ſo called, are the only remaining Part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which as yet I have not touched upon. This is that particular Country, which a certain Man in King <hi>James</hi> II.'s Time called the Kingdom of <hi>Argyll,</hi> complimenting King <hi>James</hi> upon having conquered two Kings, when he ſuppreſſed the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whom in Deriſion they called the little King of <hi>Lime,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Argyll,</hi> whom they called, with much more Propriety, the great King of the <hi>Highlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' the greateſt Part of theſe Weſtern <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> may be ſaid to be ſubject to the Houſe of <hi>Argyll,</hi> or, to ſpeak more properly, to the Family or Clan of the <hi>Campbells,</hi> of whom the Duke of <hi>Argyll</hi> is the Chief, yet ſome of the Weſtern Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are not ſo blindly guided by their Chiefs as thoſe in the North; nor, when led on, are they ſo apt to commit Outrages and Violence.</p>
            <p>But tho' the People are different in theſe Weſtern and Northern <hi>Highlands,</hi> the Countries are much alike; only in the former there are not ſuch extenſive Woods of Fir-trees, nor ſuch Quantities of large Eagles.</p>
            <p>The People alſo dreſs alike in both, in the <hi>Plaid</hi> and the <hi>Trouſe</hi>; go naked from below the Knee to the Mid-thighs; wear a Durk and a Piſtol at their Girdle, and a Target at their Shoulder.</p>
            <p>Some reckon the Shire of <hi>Braidalbin</hi> to belong, as I have ſaid, to theſe Weſtern <hi>Highlands</hi>; not that it is Weſt in its Situation, for it is rather North; but,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0141100404:228"/>
I ſuppoſe, becauſe one Part of it is inhabited by the <hi>Campbells,</hi> whoſe Clan, as I have obſerved, generally poſſeſſes moſt of the Weſt <hi>Highlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if they claim the Country, they will have no Reaſon to boaſt of the People, who are, if I may give my Opinion, ſome of the moſt barbarous and ill-governed of all the <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>; deſperate in Fight, fierce in Converſation, apt to quarrel, miſchievous, and even Murderers in their Paſſion.</p>
            <p>At the Fight which happened at <hi>Gillekranky</hi> in <hi>Athol,</hi> againſt the Viſcount of <hi>Dundee,</hi> they tell us a Story of a Combat between an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldier and a <hi>Highlander.</hi> The <hi>Engliſhman</hi> underſtood the Back-ſword very well, but the <hi>Scotchman</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all the Blows upon his Target; and yet at the ſame time laid ſo hard at his Antagoniſt with his Broad-ſword, that he cut him in two or three Places; at which the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> enraged, rather than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, cried out to him, <hi>You Dog, come out from behind the Door, and fight like a Man</hi>; but the <hi>Scot,</hi> tho' as brave as the other, knew better things; he purſued him, in ſhort, ſo cloſely, that he was juſt going to kill him, when ſome of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſaw him diſtreſſed, came up and reſcued him, and took the <hi>Highlander</hi> Priſoner.</p>
            <p>It is hard to ſay whether the Northern or Weſtern <hi>Highlanders</hi> make the beſt Soldiers. 'Tis certain they both of them are defrauded of an Honour due to them, when we attribute ſeveral gallant Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Battalions Abroad, which were performed by the <hi>Scots.</hi> Thus in particular 'tis ſaid, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops beat the <hi>Germans</hi> out of <hi>Cremona,</hi> after they had got Poſſeſſion of the Town, and had taken the <hi>French</hi> General, the Marſhal <hi>Viller<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> Priſoner: That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Battalions in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service behaved gallantly in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſo on many extraordinary Occaſions. Now tho' it is true, that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0141100404:229"/>
the <hi>Scots</hi> came originally from <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet 'tis to be obſerved, that theſe Soldiers were moſt of them <hi>Scots Highlanders,</hi> who, upon all Occaſions get over into <hi>France,</hi> there liſt among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops; nay, in the late Wars, it has been obſerved, whole Regiments of <hi>Highlanders</hi> have been raiſed for the Service, who, when they were got Abroad, would take the firſt Opportunity to deſert, and go over to the <hi>French,</hi> and ſo liſt in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Battalions, their original Countrymen, and who ſtill ſpeak the ſame Language.</p>
            <p>Leaving the Country about <hi>Brechin,</hi> and the <hi>Lowlands</hi> of <hi>Strathern,</hi> we went away Weſt; but were preſently interrupted by a vaſt inland Sea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Lake, called <hi>Lochlomond.</hi> It is indeed a Sea, and look'd like it from the Hills from whence we firſt deſcry'd it. It contains thirty Iſlands, three of which have Churches, and ſeveral of the reſt are inhabited. The chief is <hi>Inchmurin,</hi> about two Miles and a half in Length, fruitful in Corn and Graſs, and abounds with Deer, which the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Kings were accuſtomed to hunt there. The others moſt remarkable are <hi>Nachaſtel,</hi> ſo called from the old Caſtle in it. <hi>Inchdavanan,</hi> noted for Broom, abundance of wild Berries, pleaſant Habitations, Gardens and Fruit-trees. <hi>Inchonnaugan,</hi> noted for Birch-trees and Corn-fields. <hi>Inchnolaig,</hi> noted for Yew-trees, which grow no-where elſe in theſe Iſlands. And <hi>Rouglaſh,</hi> where the Laird of <hi>Macfarlan</hi> has a handſome Seat on the Eaſt-ſide of the Lake. <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maronoch,</hi> a fine Seat once belonging to the Earls of <hi>Caſſils</hi>; but now to the Earl of <hi>Dondonald. Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan-caſtle,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>This Lake or Loch is one of the largeſt in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being more than 20 Miles long, and generally eight Miles in Breadth, tho' at the North End of it 'tis not near ſo broad. It receives many Rivers
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0141100404:230"/>
into it, but empties itſelf into the Firth of <hi>Clyde,</hi> at one Mouth.</p>
            <p>This Lake abounds with Fiſh of ſeveral Sorts, particularly a Sort called <hi>Poans,</hi> and by ſome <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacks,</hi> peculiar to it; a Kind of Eel, very delicious to eat. This gave Occaſion to the Miſtake of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who ſaid this Lake had Fiſh without Fins. So the Beams faſtened together in ſome Places of the Lake, by the Inhabitants, and covered with Turf, for them to have recourſe to in time of War, and to move from Part to Part, gave Riſe to the Fable of floating Iſlands here.</p>
            <p>The famous <hi>Grampian</hi> Mountains begin near this Lake, and run Northward towards <hi>Aberdeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The County of <hi>Lenox,</hi> on which this Lake lies, is in Length about 24 Miles, and in Breadth about twenty. The lower Part is very fertile in Corn; the higher is hilly, mooriſh, and more fit for Paſture. It is the paternal Eſtate and Property of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> and extends itſelf from both Sides the <hi>Levin,</hi> which is the River that (as I ſaid before) empties the <hi>Loch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomond</hi> into the <hi>Clyde.</hi> On this Side, Eaſtward, <hi>Lenox</hi> joins to <hi>Monteith,</hi> which is Part of <hi>Perthſhire,</hi> and runs up for ſome Length on the Eaſt-ſide of the <hi>Loch,</hi> and on the Weſt-ſide it extends to the Edge of the <hi>Lochloing,</hi> and a great way North, almoſt to the Mountains of <hi>Lochaber.</hi>

            <p>All our Writers of the Deſcription of <hi>Lenox</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon its Family of <hi>Stuarts,</hi> as proceeding from the Royal Line of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the Royal Line may be ſaid to proceed from this Houſe, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darnley,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> having been married to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by whom he was Father of King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth and Firſt. He was moſt barbarouſly murdered; the Queen was unjuſtly blamed for it; whereas <hi>Murray</hi> projected it, <hi>Bothwell</hi> put it in Execution, <hi>Morton</hi> and others were privy to it; as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0141100404:231"/>
the ſaid Earl <hi>Morton,</hi> and others who ſuffered for it, declared at the laſt.</p>
            <p>From this Earl <hi>Matthew</hi> deſcended <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> and <hi>Richmond,</hi> who dying without Iſſue, in 1672. the Eſtate and Honour devolved to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. as Heir at Law, which he conferred on his natural Son by the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and to whom he gave the Surname of <hi>Lenox</hi>; from whom is deſcended the preſent Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Lenox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Buchanans,</hi> among many illuſtrious Names, are originally of this County, whence the famous <hi>George Buchanan,</hi> one of the great Ornaments of his Age for all polite Learning, and not hitherto equalled by any Poet or Hiſtorian ſince his Time, for ſmooth and elegant <hi>Latin.</hi> But his exceſſive Bias for the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and his inveterate Prejudice againſt the unfortunate Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> has quite loſt him the Title of Impartiality; inſomuch, that his Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland</hi> was condemned by Act of Parliament, when firſt publiſhed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1582. Whence Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> took Occaſion to ſay, He was both <hi>Decus &amp; Dedecus Patriae,</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Diſgrace</hi> of his <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dunbarton</hi> is the County Town of <hi>Lenoxſhire.</hi> It was once conſiderable for its Trade, which is now much decay'd; but is ſtill remarkable for its Caſtle, one of the ſtrongeſt by Nature in <hi>Europe</hi>; being ſecured by the River on one Side, the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Clyde</hi> on the other, by an impaſſable Moraſs on the third, and the fourth is a Precipice: Of this Caſtle the Earl of <hi>Hay</hi> is Governor.</p>
            <p>Take <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Deſcription of it, to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Effect: Betwixt the Conflux of <hi>Clyde</hi> and <hi>Leven</hi> is a Plain about a Mile long, at the End of which, where the Rivers join, is a Rock with two Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; on the Weſtermoſt is a Watch-tower, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an extended Proſpect into the neighbouring
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0141100404:232"/>
Country. The Eaſtern Summit is lower; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them are Steps cut out of the Rock, paſſable only by one Man at a time. When any Part is cut or falls off from the Rock, it emits a ſulphureous Smell. At the upper Part of the Caſtle is a great Rock of Loadſtone. The Rock is very ſteep on all Sides but towards the <hi>Clyde,</hi> where the Aſcent is more eaſy; and betwixt the two Rocks is a Space of Ground incloſed by Art and Nature, which contains many Houſes, makes a ſafe Harbour for Ships, under Protection of the Caſtle, and opens a Paſſage for Boats to the very Gate. On the Aſcent in the Middle are Houſes which look like another Caſtle, ſeparated from the former. The ſame ſerves for a Ditch on the Weſt, and the <hi>Clyde</hi> on the South; and the Tide comes up to the Eaſt-ſide; and on the North, where the Rock is ſteep, is a green Plain. Three Wells are in the Caſtle always flowing with Water, beſides many Springs; ſo that it may well be deemed impregnable. The Town lies about half a Mile from it, on the Bank of the <hi>Levin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Wall, which begins at <hi>Abercorn,</hi> runs thro' this County, and ends at <hi>Kilpatrick</hi> on <hi>Clyde,</hi> a Regality of the Lord <hi>Blantyre</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>We now entered the large extended Country of <hi>Argyll,</hi> or the Weſtern Iſlands, commonly called, <hi>the Shire of Innerary,</hi> from the principal Town, where the Duke of <hi>Argyll</hi> has his Reſidence. It comprehends, as I have ſaid, <hi>Argyllſhire, Knapdale, Caval, Kintyre,</hi> and <hi>Lorn,</hi> with the Weſtern Iſles of <hi>Coll, Illcollimkil, Iſla, Jura, Liſmore, Mull, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reff,</hi> and <hi>Wyſt.</hi> It is 120 Miles long, and 40 broad. It joins to <hi>Perthſhire</hi> on the Eaſt, to <hi>Lochaber</hi> on the North-eaſt, to the Iſles on the North-weſt, and to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea on the South.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kintyre</hi> is a Peninſula, which runs 30 Miles out into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea, and is no more than 13, ſome ſay 16 Miles from <hi>Ireland. Campbel-town,</hi> made a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0141100404:233"/>
Royal Burgh by King <hi>William,</hi> with a ſafe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Ships, lies in this County. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays, the People of this Part, formerly made Excurſions into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and poſſeſſed themſelves of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Gline</hi> and <hi>Rowle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knapdale</hi> joins to <hi>Kintyre</hi> on the North by a narrow Neck of Land, ſcarce a Mile over, thro' which the People of the Country draw their ſmall Veſſels, to avoid ſailing round to <hi>Kintyre.</hi> It abounds with Lakes and Bays, ſeveral of which contain Iſlands and Caſtles; and the Soil is generally fitter for Paſturage than Cultivation; yet it produces Corn in great Plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorn</hi> is the pleaſanteſt and moſt fruitful Part of the Shire of <hi>Argyll.</hi> The Caſtle of <hi>Dunſtafage</hi> ſtands in this County, formerly a Royal Seat, where ſeveral of the antient Kings are buried. The Family of <hi>Campbell</hi> was made Earls by King <hi>James</hi> II. of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> They were a long time Lords Juſtices Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Kingdom; but ſurrendered that Office to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. on a valuable Equivalent, beſides having the Juriſdiction of <hi>Argyll</hi> and the Iſles, and are ſtill Great Maſters of the King's Houſhold in <hi>Scotland.</hi> They derive their Surname from the Caſtle of <hi>Campbell,</hi> and according to <hi>Camden,</hi> their Pedigree from the antient Kings of <hi>Argyll,</hi> by a long Series of Anceſtors. The Earl of <hi>Loudon,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Braidalbin,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Iſla,</hi> and other great Men, are of this Family.</p>
            <p>The whole Shire of <hi>Argyll,</hi> taking in the above Parts, has ſeven Bays of the Sea entering into it, called, by the Inhabitants, <hi>Lochs</hi>; the chief is <hi>Lochfyn,</hi> famous for the Number and Goodneſs of its Herrings; it is ſaid to be about 40 Miles in Length, and at the narroweſt Place about four in Breadth. <hi>Lochew,</hi> according to Biſhop <hi>Leſly,</hi> is almoſt as large as <hi>Lochlomond,</hi> and contains twelve Iſlands, in one of which is the Caſtle of <hi>Enconel,</hi> in another
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0141100404:234"/>
that of <hi>Gleurquhart,</hi> and where it enters the Sea, abounds with Salmon. The Sea-coaſt of <hi>Argyll,</hi> or as far as <hi>Lochfyn,</hi> abounds with high Rocks, and black Mountains covered with Heath, which afford Paſturage for Black Cattle and Deer. The Black Cattle run for the moſt part wild, but are excellent Meat; and their Fat, when boiled, does not congeal, as others, but continues for ſome Days like Oil. The Inhabitants make great Profit of them by ſelling them to the <hi>Lowlanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Argyll</hi> is hereditary Sheriff of this County. 'Tis an old Right of this Family, that when they marry any Daughter, their Vaſſals are obliged to pay their Portion, and are taxed in order to it, according to the Number of their Cattle.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Mull</hi> of <hi>Cantyre</hi> you ſee <hi>Ireland</hi> very plain, it being not above 15 or 16 Miles from the Point of Land, which they call the <hi>Mull,</hi> to the Fair <hi>Foreland,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Colrain,</hi> on the North of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In the Mouth of this Sea of <hi>Clyde</hi> lies a Rock, ſomewhat like the <hi>Baſs</hi> in the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Forth,</hi> or of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> not for Shape, but for this Particular, that at the <hi>Baſs</hi> the <hi>Solan</hi> Geeſe are noted to come in the Seaſon of the Fiſhery, and then fly back again. This Iſland is called the <hi>Ailzey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall here mention the Iſles of <hi>Bute</hi> and <hi>Arran. Buchanan</hi> ſays, that of <hi>Bute</hi> is eight Miles long, and four broad; Biſhop <hi>Leſly,</hi> that it is 10 Miles long. It is fruitful in Corn and Paſturage. It has a Royal Burgh called <hi>Rothſay,</hi> with an antient Caſtle. From this the Royal Family of <hi>Stuart</hi> is ſuppoſed to derive their Origin: And Duke of <hi>Rothſay</hi> is now one of the Titles of the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> It has another Caſtle called the Caſtle of <hi>Kermes,</hi> and four Churches. This Iſland lies in the Mouth of the <hi>Clyde,</hi> eight Miles Weſt from <hi>Arran,</hi> and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for its Herring-fiſhing. The Iſle of <hi>Bute</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0141100404:235"/>
gives Title of Earl to a Branch of the noble Family of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who is the chief Proprietor, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retable Coroner of the Iſland, and has a Seat at <hi>Roſa</hi>; as <hi>Callartine</hi> has at <hi>Kermes,</hi> and <hi>Stuart</hi> of <hi>Aſcog</hi> another. Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> before ſhe married Lord <hi>Darnley,</hi> conferred upon him the Title of Duke of <hi>Rothſay.</hi> Near <hi>Bute</hi> are two ſmall Iſlands, called <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Little Cumbrays,</hi> the Property of the Earl of <hi>Glaſgow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Iſle of <hi>Arran,</hi> which with <hi>Bute</hi> make up one Sheriffdom, lies alſo in the Mouth of the <hi>Clyde,</hi> 24 Miles in Length, and near 16 broad, fruitful in Corn and Paſturage. It is very well inhabited on the Coaſt, and is a ſafe and good Harbour, covered by <hi>Lamlaſh</hi> or the <hi>Holy Iſle.</hi> It has two Churches, and ſeveral Caſtles, of which that of <hi>Brodich</hi> is the ſtrongeſt and moſt noted, and is the Reſidence of the <hi>Hamilton</hi> Family when in theſe Parts, who alſo have a Foreſt here containing about 400 Head of Deer; and the Iſland gives Title of Earl to the Duke of that Name. The Iſland has ſeveral Rivers in it, which abound with Salmon, as the Sea about it does with Herrings, Cod and Whitings.</p>
            <p>The People are Proteſtants, ſpeak the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Language, and are ſtill compoſed of ſeveral Tribes or Clans. The moſt ancient are <hi>Mac-Lewis,</hi> of <hi>French</hi> Extraction, in <hi>Engliſh</hi> named <hi>Fullerton,</hi> and Lairds of <hi>Kirk-Michael,</hi> where they reſide.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Iſlands are ſurrounded with a tumultous and dangerous Sea, eſpecially in a hard South-weſt Wind, which brings the Sea rolling in upon them in a frightful manner. But the above Harbour of <hi>Lamlaſh</hi> ſtands them in great ſtead in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Now we are upon theſe Weſtern Coaſts, I ſhall mention, that in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1740. an Attempt was made by Diving, to come at one of the largeſt Ships of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armada, ſtranded in 1588. on theſe Coaſts. Another was dived for ſome
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0141100404:236"/>
Years ago; but the Sand being looſe, it turned to little or no Account. The other, which was loſt near <hi>Portin-croſs,</hi> was begun to be ſearched after by Sir <hi>Archibald Grant,</hi> and Captain <hi>Roe,</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1740. and the following was the Account that was tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, which we the rather inſert, as it gives ſome Notion of the Operation by the Diving-engine.</p>
            <p>The Country People had preſerved by Tradition the Spot pretty near where ſhe ſunk, and gave them all the Information they were able: Immediately the Divers went to Work, and ſwept for her, which they do thus: They have a long Line, which they ſink with Leads; one End of the Rope is fixed to one Boat, and the other End to another; they row; and whatever interrupts them, the Diver goes down to make a Diſcovery. They ſoon happened on the Place where the Ship lay, which is ſcarce a Quarter of a Mile from the Shore, in ten Fathom and a Foot Water. Captain <hi>Roe</hi> immediately went down, and found the Veſſel to be very intire, to have a great Number of Guns on board, but to be full of Sand. The firſt Thing he fixed upon was a Cannon, which lay upon the Sand at the Head of the Ship: To this he fixed his Tongs, which are made of ſtrong Bars of Iron; they are open when they are let down, and have Teeth which join into one another. As ſoon as they are fixed upon any thing, he gives the Signal, when they are made to ſhut, and the heavier the Subject, the cloſer they hold. The Cannon was drawn up with a good deal of Difficulty; it meaſures full nine Feet, is of Braſs, greeniſh-coloured, but nothing the worſe. On the Breach there is a <hi>Roſe,</hi> with an <hi>E</hi> on the one Side and an <hi>R</hi> on the other, with this Inſcription, <hi>Richard and John Philips, Brethren, made this Piece, Anno</hi> 1584. But we may be allowed to obſerve, That by the <hi>E. R.</hi> on the Cannon, which denotes <hi>Eliz. Regina,</hi> and the <hi>Roſe,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inſcription of the Makers, it ſhould ſeem
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0141100404:237"/>
to us, that it could not belong to the Armada; but rather to ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, that might have been caſt away there. Ten of theſe Braſs Cannon, and ten Iron ones, have been ſince carried into <hi>Dublin</hi>; and they hope to recover ſixty out of this Ship. The Guns were all charged, and the Metal of ſome, by lying ſo long under Water, moulders away like Clay.</p>
            <p>Several People have ſcraped the Iron Guns, which are as mouldy as Bricks; and by keeping the Metal ſome time in their Hands, it grows ſo hot, that they are not able to bear it; but when it is expoſed two or three Hours in open Air, it loſes all its burning Quality. This is accounted for in the following Manner; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Tournefort,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Phyſician, in his <hi>Voyage to the Levant,</hi> Part I. ſays: It is certain, that the Filings of Iron, ſteeped in common Water, will grow conſiderably warm, and much more ſo in Sea Water. And if you mingle therewith ſome Sulphur powdered, you will really ſee this Mixture burn.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> in the laſt Edition of his <hi>Opticks, Pag.</hi> 354. ſays: That even the groſs Body of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, powdered with an equal Weight of Iron Filings, and a little Water made into a Paſte, acts upon the Iron; and in five or ſix Hours grows too hot to be touched, and emits a Flame.</p>
            <p>Now it is certain, that caſt Iron contains a great deal of Bitumen or Sulphur in its Compoſition, and that Iron in its ſenſible Quality effects Heat, and cannot be perceived without the Admiſſion of Air; which is the Reaſon why the Scrapings ſhould grow hot, altho' the Guns are actually cold to the Touch.</p>
            <p>As I have given Accounts of ſeveral publick Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and other laudable Inſtitutions, in the Southern Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> it would be inexcuſable not to mention the Society in <hi>Scotland</hi> for propagating Chriſtian Knowledge in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> it being one of the worthieſt Deſigns of the preſent Age; and as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0141100404:238"/>
we ſhall include in it alſo a Deſcription of the ſaid <hi>Highlands,</hi> and of the <hi>Scots</hi> Iſlands beſides; we cannot inſert it in a more proper Place. It is comprehended in a Letter written <hi>June</hi> 1739. from a Gentleman who is a great Encourager of this noble Inſtitution, to his Friend; and is as follows: <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <p>"The Extent of the <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> is much greater than has commonly been imagined: From the <hi>Mull</hi> of <hi>Kintyre</hi> to <hi>Farohead</hi> in <hi>Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navern,</hi> is more than 200 Miles in a ſtrait Line from South to North; and from <hi>Farohead</hi> to <hi>John a Grot</hi>'s Houſe, is above 60 Miles along the North and Northern Coaſt of the Continent: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is a vaſt Number of inhabited Iſlands, of which ſome are both large and populous: For inſtance, <hi>Jura</hi> is 24 Miles long; <hi>Iſla,</hi> 16; <hi>Mull,</hi> 24; <hi>Skye,</hi> 48; <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> comprehending <hi>Bara, Southuiſt, Northuiſt,</hi> and <hi>Lewes,</hi> 100; and many others, from two to 12 Miles in Length. The Iſles of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Zetland</hi> are to be conſidered by themſelves; for to <hi>Orkney</hi> alone belong thirty-three inhabited Iſlands, one of which is 24 Miles, and another 12, in Length. In <hi>Zetland</hi> there are about 30 inhabited Iſlands, ſome of which are ſix, others ſeven Miles long. Many of theſe Iſlands lie at conſiderable Diſtances from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and from one another, and are in Extent about one half of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <p>"In this large Track of Country, Ignorance and Superſtition greatly prevail: In ſome Places, the Remains even of Paganiſm are ſtill to be found; and in many others, the Reformation from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery has never yet obtained. The Pariſhes where Miniſters are ſettled, are commonly of very great Extent, ſome 30, 40, 50 Miles long, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally divided by impaſſable Mountains and Lakes; ſo that moſt of the Inhabitants, being
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0141100404:239"/>
deſtitute of all Means of Knowledge, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Schools to educate their Children, are intirely ignorant of the Principles of Religion and Virtue, live in Idleneſs and Poverty, have no Notion of Induſtry, or Senſe of Liberty; are ſubject to the Command of their Popiſh diſaffected Chieftains, who have always oppoſed the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Chriſtian Knowledge, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, that they might with leſs Difficulty keep their miſerable Vaſſals in a ſlaviſh Dependence. The poorer Sort have only the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongue, and little Correſpondence with the civilized Parts of the Nation, and only come among them to pillage the more induſtrious Inhabitants: They are brought up in Principles of Tyranny and Arbitrary Government, depend upon foreign Papiſts as their main Support, and the native <hi>Iriſh</hi> as their beſt Correſpondents and Allies. This has been the Source of all the Rebellions and Inſurrections in that Country ſince the Revolution.</p>
                  <p>"On the other hand, they are naturally of a quick Genius, of great bodily Strength, inured to Hardſhip. Their Country is commodiouſly ſituated for the nobleſt Fiſhery in the World, of which our Neighbours have made immenſe Profit. They have Mines and Woods, and great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Black Cattle, and vaſt Tracks of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable Land, which lie waſte for want of Induſtry in the People, and not conſidering the Advantage of their Situation.

                  <p>"In the Year 1701, ſome Gentlemen of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> firſt conſidered of proper Methods for civilizing and reforming them; and agreed, that the ſetting up of Schools in different and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Places, for the inſtructing of their Youth in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, and Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and diſpoſing them to Virtue and Induſtry, would be the moſt likely and effectual Means. They joined in a voluntary Subſcription among themſelves, and engaged as many others in it as they could, which laid the firſt Foundation of this great and publick Deſign. They ſoon found the Work too heavy a Burden for a few private Hands, and made Application to her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> who was graciouſly pleaſed to approve and recommend the ſame by her Royal Proclamation, in the Year 1708: and in 1709. granted her Letters Patent, conſtituting and appointing a certain Number of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers to be a Society, or Body Politick, by the Name of, <hi>The Society in</hi> Scotland <hi>for propagating Chriſtian Knowledge in the Highlands, and Iſlands, &amp;c.</hi> with full Powers to receive Donations of Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to purchaſe Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding 2000<hi>l.</hi> a Year; and with the Profits and yearly Intereſt of the ſame to erect and maintain Schools, with many other Privileges and Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Lords of Seſſion, or Judges in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> according to her Majeſty's Commiſſion, nominated 82 Subſcribers to be the firſt Members of the Society, all of them Perſons of the beſt and moſt diſtinguiſhed Characters; who at their firſt General Meeting choſe a Preſident, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, a Secretary, and other Officers. They alſo choſe a Committee of Fifteen, who meet every
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0141100404:241"/>
Month, or oftener, as they have Occaſion. There is a General Meeting of the whole Society every three Months, when they aſſume new Members, make general Regulations, give Orders to the Committee, and receive their Accounts. All Proceedings, both of the Committee, and of the General Meeting, are recorded in diſtinct Books, which are always open to the Examination of every Contributor. The Names of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributors are kept in a diſtinct Regiſter with an Account of the ſeveral Benefactions.</p>
                  <p>"In the Year 1710. they began to ſettle Schools in ſuch Places as had never been reformed from Heatheniſm: And their capital Stock having yearly increaſed by the liberal Contributions of many Perſons of all Ranks in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and amounting to above 10000<hi>l.</hi> moſt of which is laid out upon good Security, they have increaſed their Schools in Proportion. Their Number at preſent is about 100, where above 4000 are taught <hi>gratis,</hi> to read, write, Arithmetick, and Pſalmody. Many of the poorer Scholars have a weekly Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for their Maintenance, and Cloaths and Books provided for them. Great Care is taken, that the School-maſters are Men of Probity, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and well affected to the Government; and they are obliged, beſides the teaching the Children in the Schools, to inſtruct thoſe in the Principles of Religion who are too old to come to School, and at too great a Diſtance from the Pariſh Church. Many Popiſh Parents have at length permitted their Children to be inſtructed.</p>
                  <p>"This Society has appointed Perſons of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Conſideration to be Viſitors of their Schools, and to examine the Conduct and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the School-maſters, and the Proficiency of the Scholars, and to tranſmit Accounts to them at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> All poſſible Care is taken to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0141100404:242"/>
manage the Money to the beſt Advantage, not a Farthing being diverted to any other Purpoſe; and all the principal Officers of the Society ſerve <hi>gratis.</hi> The Succeſs of the Undertaking has anſwered all the Pains and Expence of the Society: There appears a great Diſpoſition in the riſing Generation to be inſtructed; many have learned to read the Scriptures, and attend Divine Service in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> where formerly the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongue was only underſtood. Several of the Scholars are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of aſſiſting the Maſters; and ſome of them of being Maſters of the Society's Schools. Many of them have attained to ſuch Degrees of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as to be admitted to the Celebration of the Lord's Supper. The Face of Reformation and Virtue begins to appear every-where; and there is Reaſon to apprehend, that in a few Years, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Popery, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Language, will be utterly extirpated; and in their ſtead, Virtue, Loyalty, and Induſtry, will take Place.</p>
                  <p>"Nevertheleſs, the preſent Fund is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient to the Vaſtneſs of the Deſign, as appears from the Report of the Commiſſioners, appointed by his late Majeſty King <hi>George, Anno</hi> 1716, to inquire into the State of the <hi>Highlands</hi> and Iſlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in purſuance of an Act of Parliament of the preceding Seſſion, who gave it as their Opinion, That no Method was ſo likely to reduce theſe Countries to a State of Peace among themſelves, and hearty Subjection to the preſent Government, as that of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Schools among them; and that over and above the preſent Number, one hundred and fifty more were abſolutely neceſſary to render the Deſign fully effectual.</p>
                  <p>"This Report had ſo good an Effect, that it was enacted, (<hi>Anno</hi> 4 <hi>Georgii</hi>) in the Act for veſting the forfeited Eſtates in Truſtees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'That a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0141100404:243"/>
Sum not exceeding 20000<hi>l.</hi> ſhall be appropriated towards making a capital Stock, for a yearly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or Income, out of the Moneys which ſhall ariſe by Sale of the ſaid Eſtates which are in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> towards erecting and maintaining Schools in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> &amp;c. And in the Act (6 <hi>Georgii</hi>) for laying a Duty on wrought Plate, there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, That nothing therein ſhall invalidate the ſaid Proviſion for Schools in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> &amp;c. But notwithſtanding this charitable Proviſion of the Legiſlature, 'tis much to be lamented, that neither that Country, nor this Society, ever reaped any Benefit by it, the Produce of the ſaid Eſtates having been applied to other Purpoſes; whereby the reforming and civilizing of that Country is left to depend very much on private Contribution.</p>
                  <p>"I muſt not forget to obſerve, That the Society's Charter extends to Popiſh and Infidel Countries beyond the Seas, and that four Miſſionaries are maintained for converting the native <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>America</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith; three of which are ſtationed on the Frontiers of <hi>New England,</hi> between our Settlements and thoſe of <hi>French Canada,</hi> by which Means the <hi>Indians</hi> in thoſe Parts will more eaſily be kept in Subjection to our Government. The Charge of theſe three is in a great meaſure defrayed out of an Eſtate left to the Society by a late worthy Clergyman in <hi>England</hi> for that Purpoſe. The other Miſſionary is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſupported at the Society's Charge in the new Colony of <hi>Georgia</hi>; where ſeveral of the poorer People are gone to reſide.</p>
                  <p>"And to render this Deſign more fully a national Benefit, his preſent Majeſty, from an earneſt Deſire to promote the Good of his Subjects in all Parts of his Dominions, was graciouſly pleaſed, in the Year 1738, to grant his Royal additional
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0141100404:244"/>
Charter, to cauſe ſuch Children as they ſhould find proper, to be inſtructed in Huſbandry, Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry, and Manufactures. The Society is taking all proper Meaſures for erecting Working-ſchools; and have good Encouragement to hope, that the landed Gentlemen in the <hi>Highlands</hi> and Iſles will not ſuffer themſelves to be outdone by their Proteſtant Neighbours in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who took the firſt Hint from their Deſign; but will, like them, let out and make Grants of ſmall Parcels of Ground to build their Schools, and for Kitchen-gardens and Agriculture; and for the raiſing of Hemp and Flax for the Linen Manufacture, which is now ſo greatly improved in that Country. This is the diſtinct State of the Caſe, in all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Steps of it.</p>
                  <p>"As this Undertaking is not the Work of a Party or Faction, but the common Cauſe of Chriſtianity, and an Attempt to civilize vaſt Numbers of People, near half a Million, and make them uſeful to Society, who have been in a great meaſure uſeleſs, and in ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances very hurtful to it; 'tis apprehended, That the Wealthy and Well-diſpoſed, who have an hearty Zeal for the Honour of God, and the Good of the Souls of Men, a true Love for their Country, and the publick Welfare, or a due Concern for the Proteſtant Religion, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happy Eſtabliſhment, cannot eaſily find any Inſtance of Uſefulneſs more likely to turn to Account, or capable of anſwering more noble and extenſive Purpoſes of Good."</p>

This Iſland in general affords good Paſturage for Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of all Sorts. They have a great many Deer, and abound with Wild-fowl, and very fine Hawks. Their Horſes are little, but very ſprightly; their Black Cattle excellent Meat. Their Corn is Barley and Oats. It formerly abounded with Wood, but moſt of it is now cut.

Here is a freſh-water Lake, with an Iſland and an old Caſtle in it, and an Harbour for Long-boats, which are uſed in that Country. It formerly belonged to the Family of <hi>Maclean,</hi> but now to the Duke of <hi>Argyll.</hi> There is one Church in this Iſland, called <hi>Sorabi,</hi> whereof the Dean of the <hi>Iſles</hi> was Miniſter. The People are Proteſtants: they are not very healthy, as the Country lies low.</p>
               <p>Near this are two Iſlands, called KERNIBERG, ſo ſtrong by Nature, that a little Art would make them impregnable.</p>
               <p>About half a League to the North-eaſt lies the Iſland of COLL, ten Miles long, and two broad, and is very fruitful: It has ſeveral Rivulets, which afford Salmon, and a freſh-water Lake, that has Trouts and Eels. The Proprietor is a Branch of the Family of <hi>Maclean.</hi> The Inhabitants are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. They have a Notion here, that <hi>Tyre-ty</hi>

breeds more Women than Men, and <hi>Coll</hi> more Men than Women; ſo that they may people each other without the Aſſiſtance of their Neighbours. The Coaſts of this Iſland abound with larger Cod and Ling, than are to be found on the Coaſts of the neighbouring Iſles and Continent.</p>
               <p>North from this lies the Iſle of RUM, ſix Miles long, and four broad: It is mountainous and heathy, but the Coaſt is arable and fruitful: It is but thinly inhabited, and the Sea Fowl lay their Eggs in ſuch Quantities, that in the Spring any one may gather what Number he pleaſes. The Rivulets of this Iſland afford Salmon, and there is plenty of Land and Sea Fowl, eſpecially thoſe called <hi>Puffins:</hi> There are alſo abundance of Deer in the Mountains. The Proprietor is <hi>Maclean</hi> of <hi>Coll,</hi> and the Inhabitants are Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>Half a Mile from <hi>Rum</hi> lies CANNEY, two Miles long, and one Mile broad, ſurrounded with an high Rock, but plentiful in Corn and Graſs, and the Coaſts abound with Cod and Ling. In the North-end there is a Rock of Loadſtone, as ſome think, becauſe it diſorders the Needle of the Compaſs, when any Ships come near it. It has one Church, and good Anchorage on the North-eaſt.

On the South-end of it is a Mountain, and on the Top of that a high Rock, of about 150 Paces in Circumference, with a freſh-water Pool in the Middle of it; there is only one Paſs up to it, ſo that it is a natural Fort. On the South-weſt Side
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0141100404:262"/>
of the Iſle is a Cave, capable of containing ſome Hundreds of People, and there are ſeveral Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Wells in this Iſland. The Proprietors are ſome of the <hi>Macdonalds:</hi> the Inhabitants bigotted Papiſts.</p>
               <p>North from this lies SKYE, 42 Miles long, and in ſome Places 20, in others 30 Miles broad. It is ſeparated from the Shire of <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> to which it belongs, by a Firth ſo narrow, that a Man may eaſily call from one Side to the other. It is navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable by the largeſt Ships of War. The Current there is ſo violent, that no Veſſel is able to ſail againſt it, tho' the Wind prove ever ſo fair, ſo that the Tide muſt always be obſerved. The way of Ferrying Cows in the narrow Ferry, called the <hi>Kyle,</hi> where the Tide is very rapid, is thus: They tie a Withe about the Cow's Lower-jaw, and bind five of them together; after which, a Man in the End of a Boat holds the Withe that ties the foremoſt, and rows over, carrying in the Space of a few Hours, at Low-water, three or four Hundred Cows. The Country is populous, the People handſome, and very healthy. Almoſt all the Inhabitants of <hi>Skye</hi> are Proteſtants. None of them poſſeſs any Land. It is very high Ground, as well on the Coaſt as up in the Country, where there are ſeven lofty Mountains, which lie near one another, almoſt in the Centre of the Iſland. It has a great deal of arable Land, which yields a good Increaſe; ſo that they ſupply the neighbouring Continent with Barley and Oats. It has many excellent Bays and Harbours for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Fiſhing, and other Trade, and about 30 Rivers, which afford Salmon.</p>
               <p>ST. COLUMBUS's Lake has an Iſland and a Chapel in it. Moſt of the Bays abound with Herrings all the Summer; the Natives dry, and preſerve them without Salt for eight Months, without any other Art than taking out their Guts, tying a Ruſh about

their Necks, and hanging them up by Pairs upon a Rope of Heath acroſs the Houſe. Cod, Ling, Mackrel, Haddock, Whiting, Turbet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> abound on this Coaſt, as do Oyſters, and all other Sorts of Shell-fiſh. There are many large Caves in this Iſland, from the Roof of ſome of which there drops a Water, which petrifies into a white limy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; one of them in <hi>Slate,</hi> called the <hi>Golden Cave,</hi> is ſaid to be ſeven Miles long. There are abundance of old Forts on the Coaſt, which ſeem to have been erected by the <hi>Danes</hi>; they ſtand on riſing Grounds, and ſo near one another, that by a Beacon fired on any one of them, the Notice of any approaching Danger by Invaſion was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſpread thro' the whole Iſland. There are alſo ſeveral little Houſes of Stone built under Ground, for hiding People and their Goods in time of War; and others above Ground capable only of holding one Perſon, which ſeem to have been deſigned for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. There are ſeveral of the <hi>Druids</hi> Houſes yet intire in the Iſle of <hi>Skye,</hi> and in ſome other Iſles. The Vulgar in the Iſlands ſtill ſhew a great Reſpect for theſe Houſes, and never come to the ancient ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing Carns, but they walk three times round them from Eaſt to Weſt, according to the Courſe of the Sun. The Cattle here are Horſes, Cows, Sheep, Goats, and Hogs; the Cows frequently feed on the Sea-weed, and obſerve the Tide of Ebb for that End, as exactly as any Man can do. This Iſland abounds with Land and Water-fowl of many Sorts, and among others they have Hawks and Eagles. It belongs to Sir <hi>Alexander Macdonald,</hi> ſome of whoſe Anceſtors were called Kings of the <hi>Iſles</hi>; the middle Parts belong to <hi>Mackinnon</hi> of that Ilk, and the North-weſt Parts belong to <hi>Macleod</hi>; all three Chiefs of their ſeveral Clans.</p>

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0141100404:264"/>
and fitter for Paſturage than Cultivation. On the Weſt-ſide it is covered with Wood. The Coaſts of this Iſland abound with Cod and Ling.</p>
               <p>On the North-ſide of <hi>Skye</hi> lies SCALPA, five Miles in Circumference: It has Wood in ſeveral Parts of it, and is fruitful in Corn and Graſs.</p>
               <p>A little farther North lies RAARSAY, ſeven Miles long, and three broad; it has much Wood, and is fitter for Paſture than Cultivation. On the Eaſt-ſide of it is a Spring, which runs down from a Rock, and petrifies into a fine white Lime, of which it yields great Quantities. Here is alſo a Quarry of good Stone. On the Weſt-ſide are abundance of Caves, where People lodge who go thither in the Summer upon the Account of Fiſhing, or Grazing of Cattle. There are ſeveral Forts in this Iſland, ſome of which are naturally very ſtrong. The Proprietor is a Cadet of the Family of <hi>Macleod,</hi> and is as much reſpected by the Inhabitants, as if he were a Prince.</p>
               <p>A Quarter of a Mile farther North lies RONA, three Miles in Length: 'Tis fruitful in Paſturage, and the Rocks about it are of Hectick Stone.</p>
               <p>ALSVIG lies on the South-weſt Corner of <hi>Skye,</hi> is two Miles in Circumference, fruitful in Corn and Graſs, and noted for the vaſt Shoals of Herrings about it, which ſometimes entangle the Fiſhing-boats.</p>
               <p>FLADDA, two Leagues diſtant, is but two Miles in Compaſs, but much noted for its Fiſhing of all Sorts, and for big Whales, which purſue the Fiſh on the Coaſt of it. The Sea Fowl called <hi>Coulternebs,</hi> are very numerous here, and a great Flock of Plovers come hither from <hi>Skye,</hi> in the Beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and return again in <hi>April.</hi> There are ſeveral Rocks about this Iſland, particularly one, called <hi>The round Table,</hi> about half a Mile in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, with a freſh-water Spring, which makes
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0141100404:265"/>
an impregnable Fort, there being only one Way to climb up to it, by one Man at a time. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Skye,</hi> and the neighbouring Iſlands have a peculiar way of curing the Diſtempers which are incident to them, by Simples of their own Product, wherein they are ſucceſsful to a Miracle: They have alſo ſeveral Medicinal Wells; but I have not room to inſiſt upon theſe things.</p>
               <p>Eighty Miles Weſt from <hi>Skye</hi> lie nine Iſlands, the chief of which is VATERSA, which beſide many other Conveniences, has a large Harbour, capable of the greateſt Ships, where at ſtated times great Numbers of Fiſhermen meet from the neighbouring Countries.</p>
               <p>Two Miles from <hi>Vaterſa</hi> lies BARRA, ſeven Miles long, and three broad, called ſo from St. <hi>Bar,</hi> the tutelar Saint: It is fruitful in Corn, and noted for its Cod-fiſhing. The Sea enters this Iſland at a ſmall Chanel, and afterwards inlarges itſelf into a round Bay, in which is an Iſland, with a very ſtrong Caſtle. It has a good Harbour on the North-eaſt Side, where is Plenty of Fiſh; and the Rivulets on the Eaſt-ſide abound with Salmon.</p>
               <p>About a Quarter of a Mile South from <hi>Barra</hi> lies KISMUL, the Seat of <hi>Macneil</hi> of <hi>Barra,</hi> which is encompaſſed with a Stone Wall two Stories high; within which there is a Tower, a Hall, a Magazine, and other Houſes. They have a Church in this Iſland, and a Chapel, where the <hi>Macneils</hi> are buried. The Natives are Papiſts, and generally very ignorant and ſuperſtitious.</p>
               <p>Here are ſeveral other leſs Iſlands belonging to <hi>Macneil,</hi> ſome of them fruitful enough in Corn and Graſs, others left for Paſturage, and ſome of them remarkable for fiſhing of Ling and Cod. The Inhabitants are very healthful and hoſpitable: they have abundance of Sea-fowl, and when they kill any of them for Uſe, they ſalt them with the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0141100404:266"/>
Aſhes of burnt Sea-ware, which preſerves them from Putrefaction. <hi>Macneil</hi> holds his Lands of Sir <hi>Alexander Macdonald</hi> of <hi>Slate,</hi> to whom he pays 40<hi>l. Scots, per Annum,</hi> and a Hawk, if required, and is obliged to furniſh him with a certain Number of Men on extraordinary Occaſions.</p>
               <p>Betwixt <hi>Barra</hi> and <hi>Viſt</hi> lie fourteen ſmall Iſlands, not very conſiderable.</p>
               <p>A little North of <hi>Barra</hi> lies SOUTH-VIST, 21 Miles long, in ſome Places three, and in others four Miles broad. The Eaſt-ſide is mountainous, but the Weſt plain and arable. The Iſland abounds with freſh-water Lakes, which have plenty of Fowl and Fiſh, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Trouts and Eels. In ſeveral of them are Iſlands with Forts. There is one Lake three Miles long, into which the Sea has made its way, tho' the People did all they could to hinder it. The Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are healthy. One Man lately lived 130 Years, and retained his Underſtanding. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongue is here ſpoken in great Perfection. The <hi>Macdonalds,</hi> deſcended from the antient Kings of theſe Iſlands, are Proprietors, and with the Inhabitants profeſs the Popiſh Religion. The Soil is generally ſandy, but yields a good Produce of Barley, Oats, and Rye. Ambergris is ſometimes found upon the Coaſt.</p>
               <p>Betwixt this Iſland and <hi>North-viſt,</hi> two Miles North, lies BENBECULA: The Ground is all plain and ſandy betwixt them, except two little Chanels about Knee-deep at a Tide of Ebb; but the Whole is navigable by Boats at a Tide of Flood, and there lie ſeveral ſmall Iſlands on the Eaſt of theſe Chanels. <hi>Benbecula</hi> is three Miles long, and three broad: it has a Bay on the Eaſt-ſide for ſmall Veſſels, where Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are ſometimes taken. The Eaſt Part of this Iſland is arable; it has ſeveral freſh-water Lakes well ſtored with Fiſh and Fowl, and ſome ſmall Forts upon the Iſlands in thoſe Lakes. The Natives are Papiſts, and the Proprietor is one of the <hi>Macdonalds.</hi>

                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0141100404:267"/>A little North of this Iſland lies <hi>North-viſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Sir <hi>Alexander Macdonald,</hi> nine Miles long, and about thirty in Circumference. It is fitter for Paſturage than Cultivation on the Eaſt Part, where it is mountainous; but the Weſt-ſide is plain and arable, and where it is not ploughed, is covered with Clover, Daiſy, and Variety of other Plants, very pleaſant to the Sight, and of a very fragrant Smell; and affords good Paſturage. The Grain here is Barley, Oats, and Rye, which yields from ten to thirty-fold; and there is no doubt, but Wheat would grow here very well. This Iſland has ſeveral Bays on the Eaſt-ſide, where Ships may ride; the chief of which are <hi>Loch-eport, Loch-rona,</hi> and <hi>Loch-maddes</hi>; the latter is capable of Hundreds of Veſſels of the greateſt Size: 400 Veſſels have been loaden with Herrings there in a Seaſon. Cod, Ling, and all Sorts of Fiſh, that frequent the Weſtern Seas, are to be found here. There is a ſmall Iſland in this Bay, upon which a Magazine was erected for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Fiſhery in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. There is ſuch a Number of freſh-water Lakes in this Iſland, as can hardly be believed; they are generally well ſtored with Trouts and Eels, and, which is more ſtrange, with Cod, Ling, and other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, brought in to them by the Spring-tides. Theſe Lakes have many ſmall Iſlands, which abound with Variety of Land and Sea Fowl; and ſome of them have Iſlands with Forts: It has alſo ſeveral Rivers, which afford Salmon, and ſome of them ſpeckled, with large Scales. The Inhabitants are Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other leſſer Iſlands, which lie on both Sides of <hi>North-viſt,</hi> the moſt remarkable of which is EOUSMIL, on the Weſt, a Rock about a Quarter of a Mile in Circumference, noted for its Seal-fiſhing about the End of <hi>October,</hi> where three hundred and twenty are ſometimes taken at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0141100404:268"/>Three Leagues and a half farther Weſt lie nine or ten more Rocks, which abound with Sea Fowl, and great Numbers of Seals.</p>
               <p>A little farther North lies BORERA, four Miles round; it has a freſh-water Lake well ſtored with large Eels. This Iſland affords the largeſt and beſt Sort of Dulſe. It is poſſeſſed by the Family of <hi>Maclean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Half a League South from this lies LINGAY, which furniſhes the neighbouring Iſlands with Peat for Fewel. It has abundance of Black Cattle, that make excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Meat; the Natives ſalt it in the Hides, which, they ſay, preſerves it, and makes it taſte better than when ſalted in Caſks. This Iſland abounds alſo with Deer, Sea and Land Fowl of all Sorts; among the reſt, with Hawks, Eagles, and Swans. The Inhabitants of <hi>South</hi> and <hi>North-viſt</hi> are generally well proportioned and healthful, and many of them live to a great Age; they are very hoſpitable and kind to Strangers.</p>
               <p>The Iſle of LEWES derives its Name from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Word <hi>Leog,</hi> ſignifying <hi>a Lake,</hi> with which this Iſland abounds; it is by the Iſlanders commonly called the <hi>Long Iſland:</hi> it is near 100 Miles from North to South, and from 13 to 14 in Breadth; it is reckoned part of the Shire of <hi>Roſs</hi>; but the Iſle of <hi>Lewes,</hi> properly ſo called, is but 36 Miles in Length, and 10 or 12 broad, belonging to the Earl of <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth.</hi> It reaches from the North of <hi>Bowling-head</hi> to the South of <hi>Haſſineſs.</hi> The Southern Part is named <hi>Harries.</hi> The Air is temperately cold and moiſt, and the Natives uſe commonly a Doſe of <hi>Uſquebaugh</hi> for a Corrective. The Iſland is healthful, eſpecially in the Middle, from South and North; it is arable on the Weſt-ſide for about 16 Miles on the Coaſt, and is likewiſe plain and arable in ſeveral Places in the Eaſt: It is fruitful in Corn, and yields a good Increaſe; their common Grain is Barley, Oats, and Rye; and they have alſo Flax and Hemp. There are ſeveral convenient Bays and Harbours here,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0141100404:269"/>
particularly <hi>Lochſtornvay,</hi> on the Eaſt-ſide, in the Middle of the Iſland; the <hi>Birkin Iſland,</hi> ſeven Miles Southward; <hi>Locheolmkil,</hi> three Miles farther South; <hi>Lochſefort</hi> and <hi>Lochcarlvay,</hi> 24 Miles South-weſt. This Bay is remarkable for great Numbers of Cod, Ling, and Whales, which frequent it; and all the Bays and Coaſts abound with Cod, Ling, Herring, and all other Sorts of Fiſh taken in the Weſtern Seas, beſides Plenty of Shell-fiſh of all Sorts, in ſuch vaſt Numbers, that the Inhabitants are not able to conſume them. Coral and Pearl-ſhells are alſo found in the Bays and Coaſts. There are ſeveral extraordinary Springs and Fountains in this Iſland, and abundance of Caves on the Coaſts, which Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Seals, and Fowl frequent in great Numbers. That Obeliſk (if I may call it ſo) in the Pariſh of <hi>Barvas</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Lewes,</hi> called <hi>The Thruſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> is very remarkable; being not only above 20 Feet high, but likewiſe almoſt as much in Breadth, which no other comes near. The <hi>Dun,</hi> or Fortification built on an Eminence in <hi>St. Kilda,</hi> which is an old Fort, is about 18 Leagues diſtant from <hi>North Viſt,</hi> and 20 from the Middle of <hi>Lewes,</hi> or <hi>Harries,</hi> to be ſeen only in a very fair Day, like a blueiſh Miſt; but a large Fire there would be viſible at Night, as the aſcending Smoke by Day. In this ſame Iſle (where are many ſuch <hi>Duns</hi>) North of the Village of <hi>Brago,</hi> is a round Fort compoſed of huge Stones, three Stories high; that is, it has three hollow Paſſages one over another, within a prodigious thick Wall quite round the Fort, with many Windows and Stairs.</p>
               <p>Here alſo, at the Village of <hi>Claſſerniſs,</hi> is a Druidical Temple extremely remarkable. The Circle conſiſts of 12 Obeliſks, about ſeven Feet high each, and diſtant from each other ſix Feet. In the Centre ſtands a Stone 13 Feet high, in the perfect Shape of the Rudder of a Ship. Directly
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0141100404:270"/>
South from the Circle, ſtand four Obeliſks running out in a Line, another ſuch Line due Eaſt, and a third to the Weſt; the Number and Diſtances of the Stones being in theſe Wings the ſame: ſo that this Temple, the moſt intire that can be, is at the ſame time both round and winged. But to the North, reach (by way of Avenue) two ſtrait Ranges of Obeliſks, of the ſame Bigneſs and Diſtances with thoſe of the Circle; yet the Ranges themſelves are eight Feet diſtant, each conſiſting of 19 Stones, the 39th being in the Entrance of the Avenue. This Temple ſtands aſtronomically, denoting the 12 Signs of the Zodiack, and the four principal Winds, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided each into four others; by which, and the 19 Stones, on each ſide the Avenue, repreſenting the Cycle of 19 Years, it appears to have been dedicated principally to the Sun, but ſubordinately to the Seaſons, and the Elements; particularly to the Sea, and the Winds, as is manifeſt by the Rudder in the Middle.</p>
               <p>This Iſland abounds with Cows, Horſes, Sheep, Goats and Hogs; the Black Cattle are ſmall, but very prolifick, and make excellent Meat; the Horſes are likewiſe ſmaller than on the Continent, but as ſerviceable for all domeſtick Uſes, and live very hard, having little to feed upon in the Spring but Sea-ware. The Inhabitants are well proportioned, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral healthful and ſtrong, and of a ſanguine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; they are very quick of Apprehenſion, and Lovers of Poeſy and Muſick: They are dextrous at Swimming, Volting, and Archery, and make ſtout, able Seamen.</p>
               <p>In a little Iſland near the greater one of <hi>Lewes,</hi> were a couple of Eagles, which would never ſuffer any other of their Kind to continue in the Place; driving away their own young ones, as ſoon as they were able to fly. The Natives ſaid, That thoſe Eagles were ſo careful of their Habitation, that they
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0141100404:271"/>
never killed any Sheep or Lamb in the Iſland, tho' the Bones of Lambs, Fawns, and Wild-fowl, were frequently found in and about their Neſts; ſo that they made their Purchaſe in the oppoſite Iſlands, the neareſt of which is a League diſtant.</p>
               <p>There are many other leſſer Iſlands, which lie round this; the chief of which are, GARVE, in the Mouth of <hi>Lochcarlvay,</hi> a high Rock, half a Mile in Compaſs, affording good Paſturage, and naturally a ſtrong Fort: the two BERNERA's, one two Miles, and the other four Miles long, and four Miles broad; both fruitful in Corn and Graſs.</p>
               <p>Near <hi>Carlvay Bay</hi> lie four ſmall Iſlands, which belong to the Inhabitants of <hi>Lewes,</hi> who go thither every Summer, and bring from thence great Store of Fowls, Eggs, Down, Feathers, and Quills; one of them is called the ISLAND OF PYGMIES, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many little Bones, reſembling thoſe of Men, are digged out of the Ground there.</p>
               <p>Twenty Leagues from the Point of <hi>Neſſe</hi> in <hi>Lewes</hi> lies <hi>Rona,</hi> a Mile long, and half a Mile broad: it has a Hill on the Weſt Part, which makes it viſible from <hi>Lewes</hi> in the Summer-time. It was inhabited by about five Families, who had the Iſland and the Fiſhery about it divided among them, and were very exact and nice in their Properties; and when their Number increaſed, the Supernumeraries were ſent to their Landlord in <hi>Lewes,</hi> who once a Year ſends the Miniſter of his Pariſh, and a Servant, to viſit them, and bring his Rents, which are paid in Barley-meal ſewed up in Skins, Sea Fowl, and ſome Fiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They have a Chapel dedicated to St. <hi>Ronan,</hi> in which they repeat the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and Ten Commandments every <hi>Lord's-day. Buchanan</hi> ſays, That the Inhabitants were, in his Opinion, the only People in the World, who never wanted any thing, and were ſatisfied with their Condition, having Plenty of all that they deſired; being equally
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0141100404:272"/>
ignorant of Luxury and Avarice, and poſſeſſing, thro' their Freedom from Vices, that Innocence and Tranquillity of Mind, which others can ſcarcely attain unto by great Labour, and with the Help of the beſt Inſtructions. Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> affirms, in his <hi>Deſcription of the Weſtern Iſlands,</hi> That antient Race of poor People was all deſtroyed about 40 Years ago, in the following manner: Firſt, A Swarm of Rats, none knows how, came into the Iſland, and eat up all their Corn. In the next Place, ſome Seamen landed, and robbed them of what Proviſions they had left. By this means they all died before the uſual Time of the Arrival of the Boat from <hi>Lewes</hi>; upon which another Colony was ſent thither.</p>
               <p>Four Leagues Eaſt from <hi>Rona</hi> lies SOULISKER, a Rock, a Quarter of a Mile in Circumference, which abounds with vaſt Numbers of Sea Fowl, particularly <hi>Solan</hi> Geeſe. On this Rock there builds one Fowl not found elſewhere, called <hi>Colk</hi>; it is leſs than a Gooſe, and all covered with Down, but of different Colours, which it caſts when it hatches; it has a Tuft on its Head reſembling that of a Peacock, and a Train longer than that of a Houſe-cock. There were formerly 24 Churches in <hi>Lewes</hi> and <hi>Harries,</hi> and the Iſlands belonging to them: but, alas! to our Shame may it be ſaid, as Papiſts were proſecuted or diſcouraged, Profaneneſs gained Ground of Superſtition, and one ſort of Ignorance ſucceeded another; for few or no Miniſters being ſent with ſuitable Proviſion and Encouragement, Places of religious Worſhip became ruinous, and the Service of God, and the Edification of the People, very much neglected; ſo that ſeveral Pariſhes in the <hi>Highlands</hi> and <hi>Iſles,</hi> at preſent, are 20, 30, or near forty Miles long, and very often without any Miniſter at all.</p>
               <p>That Part which is called HARRIES, produces the ſame Sorts of Corn, but with a greater Increaſe than <hi>Lewes.</hi> The Weſt-ſide is for the moſt part arable
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0141100404:273"/>
on the Coaſt. It has a noble Harbour called <hi>Scalpa,</hi> a Mile and a half long, and a Mile broad; and there are two other Harbours within three Leagues of it, which abound with Oyſters, and other Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh. They have excellent Springs here, ſome of which are Medicinal; one particularly near <hi>Marvag</hi> is excellent for reſtoring a loſt Appetite, and one near <hi>Borve,</hi> good againſt the Colick and Gravel. There are ſeveral Caves on the Mountains, and on each ſide of the Coaſt, and in the middle of a high Rock, capable of holding 50 Men; has two Wells, and but a narrow Paſs to it by climbing up the Rock; ſo that in Time of War it is an impregnable Fort. There are likewiſe ſeveral antient Forts in this Iſland. The Hills and Mountains abound with Deer, which none are allowed to hunt without Leave from <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leod,</hi> the Proprietor. <hi>Metricks,</hi> a four-footed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, about the Size of a large Cat, are pretty nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous here; their Skins are very fine, of a brown Colour, and make good Fur; and 'tis ſaid, the Dung of this Animal yields a Scent like Muſk. There are abundance of Otters and Seals here, great Plenty of Land and Sea Fowl, and among others, Eagles, and very good Hawks. The Inhabitants both of <hi>Lewes</hi> and <hi>Harries</hi> are Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>There are other Iſlands of ſmall Extent belonging to the <hi>Harries,</hi> the chief of which are BERNERA, two Leagues to the South; it is five Miles in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, very fruitful in Barley and Rye, and yields ſometimes from 20 to 30 Fold. There are two Chapels in this Iſland.</p>
               <p>Half a League from thence to the Weſtward lies PABBAY, three Miles in Circumference, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Corn and Graſs: It has alſo two Chapels.</p>
               <p>Half a League to the North lies SELLAY, a Mile in Circumference; it yields extraordinary Paſture for Sheep, which it fattens very ſoon, and thoſe bred there have very large Horns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0141100404:274"/>TARANSAY, a League farther North, is three Miles round, fruitful in Corn and Graſs, and yields much yellow Talc.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other Iſlands in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of two or three Miles in Circumference each, all tolerably fruitful in Corn and Paſturage; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly HERMATRA, where a Magazine for the Fiſhery was erected in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I.</p>
               <p>Eighteen Leagues Weſt from <hi>North-viſt,</hi> and 20 from <hi>Harries,</hi> lies the Iſland called ST. KILDA, or HIRTA; as <hi>This Hirta</hi> is the moſt North-weſt, ſo <hi>Dow Hirta</hi> is the moſt South-weſt of all the <hi>Scots</hi> Iſlands. The firſt, properly called <hi>St. Kilda,</hi> is two Miles long and one broad, faced round with a ſteep Rock, except at the Bay on the South-eaſt, where Veſſels enter. The Land riſes high in the Middle, and there are ſeveral Fountains of good Water on each ſide the Iſland. Their Grain is Oats and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, the latter accounted the largeſt in the <hi>Weſtern Iſles.</hi> The Inhabitants are about two hundred in Number, very well proportioned and comely. They are Proteſtants, and very zealous, according to their Knowledge, which is but ſmall for want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. They are very regular and juſt in their Converſation, and Strangers to Luxury and Exceſs, being ignorant of the Uſe of Money. They have a Chapel, where they aſſemble on the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> to hear the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; and neither work themſelves, nor will allow any Stranger to work, on that Day. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Laird of <hi>Macleod,</hi> the Chief of that antient Clan, who commonly makes ſome Cadet of his Family Steward of this Iſland, to receive his Rents, which are paid in Fiſh, Fowl, Feathers, Wool, Butter, Cheeſe, Cattle, and Corn: and the Steward's Deputy is, in his Abſence, the chief Man of the Iſland; and generally, except when a Miniſter is ſent thither from <hi>Harries,</hi> baptizes and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0141100404:275"/>
marries. They have an Altar and Crucifix in their Chapel, which have continued there ſince the Time of Popery; and tho' they pay no Worſhip to the Crucifix, yet they ſwear deciſive Oaths, by laying their Hands upon it, and take the Marriage Oath in the ſame manner. Not long ago an illiterate Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, one of the Natives, impoſed upon their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by pretending that St. <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> had appeared to him, and taught him Sermons, Prayers, and Hymns: the latter, he alledged, were effectual to ſecure Women againſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage; and his Price for teaching them was a Sheep. He told them of a little Hill, where St. <hi>John</hi> and the Virgin appeared to him: And made them believe, that if any of their Black Cattle or Sheep came near to taſte the Graſs of that Hill, they muſt immediately be killed and eaten; and it was neceſſary, that he himſelf ſhould always partake of the Treat. He was diſcovered at laſt by his lewd Attempts upon ſeveral Women; and being, by <hi>Macleod</hi>'s Order, tranſported from thence to <hi>Harries,</hi> he made publick Confeſſion of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture in ſeveral Churches, and ſeemed to be very penitent, but was not allowed to return any more. Their Houſes are low, built of Stone, and a Cement of dry Earth, and covered with Turf, thatched over with Straw. They make their Beds in the Walls of their Houſes, and lie commonly on Straw, tho' they have great Plenty of Feathers and Down. They live all together in a little Village, on the Eaſt-ſide of the Iſland, in good Harmony; are very exact and nice in their ſeveral Properties, and allow no Encroachment upon one another, nor will they admit of it from their Landlord, or his Steward, but pay exactly what they agree on. The Iſland is naturally ſtrong, and, with a little Art, might be made impregnable. There is an old Fort at the South-end of the Bay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0141100404:276"/>In the Iſland of <hi>St. Kilda</hi> is the Houſe of a Druideſs, built all of Stone, without Lime, or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Earth to cement it; it is alſo arched, and of a conick Figure, but open at the Top, and a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place in the Middle of the Floor. It cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain above nine Perſons, to ſit eaſy by each other. From the Side of the Wall go off three low Vaults, ſeparated from each other by Pillars, and capable of containing five Perſons apiece.</p>
               <p>Juſt ſuch another Houſe in all reſpects, but much larger, and grown over with a green Sod on the Outſide, is in <hi>Borera,</hi> an Iſle adjacent to <hi>St. Kilda,</hi> which was the Habitation of a Druid.</p>
               <p>At the North-end of <hi>St. Kilda,</hi> were a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Eagles, who drove away all others of the ſame Kind, even their own Progeny; and brought their Prey from other Parts, without plundering the Place of their own Reſidence.</p>
               <p>They have two other Iſlands which belong to them, one called SOA, about half a Mile from the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of <hi>St. Kilda,</hi> a Mile in Circumference, and very high and ſteep all round.</p>
               <p>The other is called BORERA, lies about two Leagues North of <hi>St. Kilda,</hi> is about a Mile in Circumference, and moſt of it ſurrounded with a high Rock. All three afford good Paſturage, and abound with prodigious Numbers of Sea Fowl from <hi>March</hi> till <hi>September.</hi> They have <hi>Solan</hi> Geeſe in ſuch Numbers, that they keep about 20,000 annually in little Stone Houſes, built on purpoſe for them, and for preſerving their other Fowl, Eggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The latter they preſerve ſome Months in the Aſhes of Peat, and they preſerve their Fowl without Salt: They eat the <hi>Solan</hi> Geeſe Eggs raw, and ſay they are good Pectorals. They have another Bird here, called <hi>Fulmar,</hi> about the Size of a Moor-hen: it picks its Food out of live Whales, and other Fiſhes. When any one approaches them, they ſpout out
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0141100404:277"/>
pure Oil from their Bills, which the Natives have a way to catch, when they ſurpriſe the Fowl; and make uſe of it for their Lamps, and likewiſe as a Remedy againſt Rheumatick Pains, Aches, and other Diſtempers. It ſerves them alſo for Vomits and Purges, for Swellings or Strains, and diſcuſſing of Tumours; in all which Caſes, they ſay, it is very ſucceſsful. Both Sexes have a Genius for Poeſy, are very hoſpitable to Strangers, and charitable to their own Poor, for whoſe Maintenance they all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in Proportion. They have but one Boat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Iſland, in which every Man has a Share proportionable to the Rent he pays. The Men are generally ſtrong, are ſtout Rowers, and will tug a long time at the Oar without Intermiſſion. They uſe no Compaſs, but take their Meaſure from the Sun, Moon, or Stars, and chiefly from the Courſes of the Flocks of the Sea Fowl, becauſe they know very well to what Rocks or Iſlands they reſort. They are excellent at climbing of Rocks, being accuſtomed to it from their Infancy, in order to catch the Fowl which build on them. They have two Ropes, which belong to them in common for climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rocks; they are 24 Fathoms in Length each, and covered with Cows Hides ſalted, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being cut by the Rocks. The Men climb by turns, and bring home ſome Thouſands of Eggs and Fowls at a time. They alſo make Gins of Horſe-hair, for catching the Fowl; yet ſometimes they loſe their Lives by climbing. The richeſt Man in the Iſle has not above eight Cows, eighty Sheep, and two or three Horſes. They have no Money, but barter with one another for what they want.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> to whom I am obliged for moſt of theſe Particulars relating to the Iſlands, (for it cannot be ſuppoſed I could think of entering every one of them in Perſon) gives an Account of that called the SECOND SIGHT, which, he ſays, is a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0141100404:278"/>
by way of Viſion, of ſomething to come, and makes ſuch a ſtrong Impreſſion upon the Seers, that they cannot ſee or think of any thing elſe while the Viſion laſts; and they appear chearful, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, according to the Nature of the Object repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; they uſe no previous Means to attain it, and to moſt of them 'tis very troubleſome. The Inſtances of the Truth of this <hi>Second Sight,</hi> as 'tis called, are ſo many, and ſo frequent, that it can ſcarcely be diſputed. 'Tis certainly a ſtrange Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but I ſhall not venture to give my Opinion about it; only obſerving, with others, that this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty decays in Proportion as Chriſtianity increaſes among them, and as they improve in Knowledge. Some of the People, to whom thoſe Viſions have been frequent, have learned by Experience, as we were told, to determine the Time when the Things repreſented ſhall come to paſs. The Reverend Mr. <hi>John Frazer,</hi> the late Dean of the <hi>Iſles,</hi> has writ a ſmall Treatiſe upon this Subject, called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>We ſhall conclude our Deſcription of theſe Iſlands with an Extract from Mr. <hi>Toland</hi>'s Specimen of his <hi>Hiſtory of the Druids</hi>; where he treats in general of the Properties of all theſe Iſles, whither, it ſeems, he had intended to have travelled, in order to perfect his Hiſtory, and reſcue many valuable Pieces of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity from utter Oblivion.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, ſays that Gentleman, no Country abounds more with the Neceſſaries of Life, and at leſs Labour or Charge, than the <hi>Hebrides.</hi> In the firſt place, there is known to be, in thoſe Iſlands, a prodigious Plenty of Fleſh and Fiſh. Their Cattle of all Sorts (as Cows, Sheep, Goats, and Hogs) are exceeding numerous and prolifick; ſmall indeed of Size, as are likewiſe their Horſes, but of a ſweet and delicious Taſte. So are their Deer, which freely range in Herds on the Mountains. No Place can
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0141100404:279"/>
compare with this for tame and wild Fowl, there being of the latter no-where in the World a greater Diverſity, many Sorts of them extremely beautiful, and rare, or utterly unknown, elſewhere. The like may be ſaid of their various amphibious Animals. Numberleſs are their Fountains and Springs, Rivulets, Rivers and Lakes, very wholſome in their Waters, and every-where ſuperabounding with Fiſh, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the moſt delicate, as Trout and Salmon: nor is it by Herrings alone that all <hi>Europe</hi> knows no Seas to be better ſtored, nor with more Kinds, from the Shrimp to the Whale; as no Harbours or Bays are ſuperior, whether regard be had to Number or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſneſs. Add to this their Variety of excellent Roots and Plants, particularly thoſe of marine Growth, every one of them ſerving for Food or Phyſick. Their Paſtures are ſo kindly, that they might live on Milk alone, with that inconceivable Quantity of Eggs they yearly gather off the deſert Rocks and Iſlets. Bread is plentiful enough. The Ground is generally allow'd to be much richer, than on the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Continent, ſome Parts whereof are not ſeldom ſupply'd hence with Corn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewes</hi> is very fruitful; and tho' Barley, Oats, and Rye, be the only Grain ſown there at preſent, yet the Ground both in that, and moſt of the other Iſlands, is fit to bear Wheat, and conſequently Legumes of all ſorts. 'Tis truly amazing they have any Crop at all, conſidering how unſkilful they are in Agriculture, how deſtitute of the propereſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to till the Ground, and that they ſcarce uſe any other Manure but Sea-wreck or Tangles. From the Ignorance of the Inhabitants in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as alſo in planting, incloſing and draining, many fruitful Spots lie uncultivated; but they are abundantly ſupply'd with choice Eatables, and the moſt nouriſhing Shell-fiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0141100404:280"/>In <hi>Bernera,</hi> near <hi>Harries,</hi> the Produce of Barley is many times from 20 to 30 fold. In <hi>Harries</hi> and <hi>South-viſt</hi> one Barley-grain ſometimes produces from 7 to 14 Ears, as in <hi>North-viſt</hi> from 10 to 30 fold in a plentiful Year. At <hi>Corchattan</hi> in <hi>Skye</hi> the Increaſe amounted once to 35. If the Ground be laid down for ſome time, it gives a good Crop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Dunging, ſome Fields not having been dung'd in 40 Years. A ſmall Tract of Ground, at <hi>Skerry-breek,</hi> in the ſaid Iſle of <hi>Skye,</hi> had yielded 100 fold. With regard to their Paſtures, nothing is more common than for an Ewe to have two Lambs at a time. Beſides the ordinary Rent a Tenant paid, it was a Cuſtom in the Iſlands, if any of his Cows or Sheep brought two young ones at a time, one of them was to go to the Landlord; who, on his part, was obliged, if any of his Tenants Wives bore Twins, to take one of them into his own Family. Even the wild Goats on the Mountains (for ſuch there are in <hi>Harries</hi>) are obſerved to bring forth their Young twice a Year. From hence 'tis evident, that thoſe Iſlands are capable of great Improvement, as they abound likewiſe in many Curioſities, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Subjects of Philoſophical Obſervation. Nor is it leſs plain by the many antient Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remaining among them, and the Marks of the Plough reaching to the very Tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, (which the artleſs Inhabitants think incapable of Culture) that in remote Ages they were in a far more flouriſhing Condition than at preſent. The Ruins of ſpacious Houſes, and the numerous Obeliſks, old Forts, Temples, Altars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> undeniably prove this; beſides that the Country was formerly full of Woods, as appears by the great Oak and Firr-trees daily dug out of the Ground, and by many other Tokens, there being ſeveral Woods and Coppices ſtill remaining in <hi>Skye, Mull,</hi> and other Places. The Inhabitants are not to be mended in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0141100404:281"/>
of their Perſons; no prepoſterous Bandages diſtorting them in the Cradle, nor hindering Nature from duly forming their Limbs; which is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that bodily Imperfections of any ſort are very rare among them. Neither does any over-officiouſly preventive Phyſick, in their Infancy, ſpoil their original Conſtitution; whence they have ſo ſtrong a Habit of Body, that one of them requires treble the Doſe, as will purge any Man in the South of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But what contributes above all things to their Health and Longevity, is conſtant Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Exerciſe. Their Food is commonly freſh, and their Meals two a Day, Water being the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Drink of the Vulgar. They cure all Diſorders of the Body by Simples of their own Growth, and by proper Diet or Labour. Hence they are ſtout and active, dextrous in all their Exerciſes; as they are withal remarkably ſagacious, cholerick, but eaſily appeaſed, ſociable, good-natured, ever-chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and having a ſtrong Inclination to Muſick. They are hoſpitable beyond Expreſſion, entertaining all Strangers, of what Condition ſoever, <hi>gratis</hi>; the Uſe of Money being ſtill in ſome of thoſe Iſlands unknown, and, till a few Ages paſt, in all of them. They have no Lawyers or Attorneys. The Men and Women plead their own Cauſes; and a very ſpeedy Deciſion is made by the Proprietor, who is perpetual Preſident in their Courts, or by his Bailiff, as his Subſtitute.</p>
               <p>The preſent (ſays Mr. <hi>Toland</hi>) is the 35th Lord of <hi>Barra</hi> by uninterrupted lineal Deſcent, a thing whereof no Prince in the World can boaſt; and he is regarded as no mean Potentate by his Subjects, who know none greater than he. When the Wife of any of them dies, he has immediate recourſe to his Lord, repreſenting firſt his own Loſs in the Want of a Female Companion; and next, that of <hi>Macneil,</hi> his Lord, himſelf, if he ſhould not go on to beget
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0141100404:282"/>
Followers for him. Hereupon <hi>Macneil</hi> finds out a ſuitable Match (neither Side ever diſliking his Choice, but accepting it as the higheſt Favour); and the Marriage is celebrated without any Courtſhip, Portion or Dowry: but they never fail to make merry on ſuch Occaſions, with a Bottle or more of Uſquebaugh. On the other hand, when any Woman becomes a Widow, ſhe is, upon the like Application, ſoon provided with an Huſband, and with as little Ceremony. <hi>Macneil</hi> alſo ſupplies any of his Tenants with as many Milch-cows, as he may chance to loſe by the Severity of the Weather; or by other Misfortunes. He takes likewiſe into his own Family, and maintains to the Day of their Death, as many old Men, as thro' Age or Infirmity become unfit for Labour, an Houſe being built hard-by on Purpoſe for them.</p>

               <p>WE come now to the Iſles of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Shetland.</hi> The <hi>Orkneys,</hi> called by the <hi>Latins Orcades,</hi> have the <hi>Caledonian</hi> Ocean on the Weſt, the <hi>German</hi> Ocean on the Eaſt, the Sea that divides them from <hi>Shetland,</hi> on the North, and <hi>Pentland</hi> Firth, 24 Miles long, and 12 Miles broad, which divides them from the main Land of <hi>Scotland,</hi> on the South. Antient Authors differ about their Number. <hi>Pliny</hi> reckoned them Forty, <hi>Oroſius</hi> Thirty-three; but it appears by later Diſcoveries, that they are only Twenty-eight. They lie in Longitude 22 Deg. 11 Min. Latitude 59 Deg. 2 Min. The longeſt Day is 18 Hours and ſome odd Minutes: The Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as in moſt ſmall Iſlands, and indeed always near the Sea, are generally more ſubject to Rain than Snow. The Froſt and Snow do not continue long, but the Wind is very boiſterous; and it rains
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0141100404:283"/>
ſometimes not by Drops, but by violent Spouts of Water.</p>
               <p>STROMA lies ſo near the Coaſt of <hi>Caithneſs,</hi> that it was always poſſeſſed by the Earls of that County, and therefore not reckoned among the <hi>Orcades.</hi> This is a ſmall Iſland, but not unfruitful. Authors are not agreed as to the Reaſon of giving the Name of <hi>Pentland Firth</hi> to that Streight, in Breadth about 12 Miles, which lies between the <hi>Orcades</hi> and the main Land; ſome ſay, it is a Corruption of the Word <hi>Pictland Firth,</hi> which was ſo called, becauſe the <hi>Picts</hi> formerly inhabited thoſe Iſlands, and part of the neighbouring Continent, and that many of them periſhed here, when repulſed by the antient Inhabitants of <hi>Orkney.</hi> Others think <hi>Pentland Firth</hi> the proper Name, and it was ſo denominated from the Highlands or Hills in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by which it is bounded on one Side, for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the high Hills, which take their Riſe ſome Miles South-weſt of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> are called <hi>Pentland Hills.</hi> This Firth is remarkable for its ſwift, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and contrary Tides, occaſioned by the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Iſles, and the Narrowneſs of the Paſſage, which makes it very dangerous, eſpecially to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and, which is remarkable, the Whirlpools, with which this Firth abounds, occaſioned, as is thought, by ſome <hi>Hiatus's</hi> in the Earth below, are moſt dangerous in a Calm, and whirl the Boats or Ships round, till they ſwallow them up; but if there be any Wind, and the Boat under Sail, they are paſſed without Danger. The Mariners, who uſe to carry Paſſengers between the main Land and the Iſles, if at any time they are driven near thoſe Whirlpools by the Tide, throw a Barrel, Oar, Bundle of Straw, or any other bulky Thing that comes to hand, into the Whirlpools, which make them ſmooth enough till the Veſſel paſs over them; and what is thus caſt in, is generally found floating again a Mile or two
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0141100404:284"/>
diſtant. The different Tides in this Firth are reckoned twenty-four, and run with ſuch impetuous Force, that no Ship under Sail, with the faireſt Wind, is able to make way againſt them; yet the Natives on both Sides, who know the proper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, paſs this Firth every Day ſafely, except when the Weather is tempeſtuous.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the <hi>Orkney</hi> Iſlands is SOUTH RONALSA, ſix Miles long and five broad, fruitful in Corn, and well inhabited; it has a ſafe Harbour on the North-ſide, but the South-eaſt has the dangerous Rocks called <hi>Pentland Skerries</hi>; it abounds with Cattle, and has two united Pariſh Churches, whereof the Dean was Miniſter.</p>
               <p>A little to the South-weſt lies SWINNA, a ſmall Iſland, fruitful in Corn, capable of maintaining a few Huſbandmen, and their Families; has a good Fiſhing on its Coaſts, and is noted for a good Slate Quarry. The Whirlpools near this Iſland are called the <hi>Wells of Swinna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beyond <hi>Swinna</hi> lie WAYES and HOY, which are but one Iſle, 12 Miles long, and full of high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: that Part called <hi>Wayes</hi> is fruitful, and very well inhabited. This Iſland has ſeveral good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, particularly that called <hi>North Hope,</hi> one of the beſt in the World, and propereſt for thoſe who deſign a Fiſhing-trade. That Part called <hi>Hoy,</hi> from which it is only ſeparated by a Spring-tide, has the higheſt Mountains in <hi>Orkney,</hi> and the deepeſt Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, which ſtrike a Terror into Strangers, who have Occaſion to travel that Way. On theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains there are many Sheep, which run wild, and are ſcarcely to be caught by any Art. On <hi>Rora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> a high and rugged Promontory in this Iſland, an extraordinary Fowl, which the Inhabitants call <hi>Lyer,</hi> builds its Neſt; it is about the Size of a Duck, and ſo fat, that it ſeems to be nothing elſe; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants admire it much, and venture their Lives

to climb for it by Ropes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is reckoned deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Food, eaten with Vinegar and Pepper. On a barren Heath in this Iſland lies an oblong Stone, in a Valley between two moderate Hills, called, by way of Contraries, <hi>The dwarfy Stone.</hi> It is 36 Feet long, 18 Feet broad, and 9 Feet high. No other Stones are near it. 'Tis all hollow'd within, having a Door on the Eaſt-ſide two Feet ſquare, with a Stone of the ſame Dimenſion lying about two Feet from it, which was intended, no doubt, to cloſe this Entrance. Within there is cut out, at the South-end of it, the Form of a Bed and Pillow, capable of holding two Perſons; as at the North-end is another Bed, both very neatly done. Above, at an equal Diſtance from both, is a large round Hole, which is ſuppoſed not only to have been deſigned for letting in Light and Air when the Door was ſhut; but likewiſe for letting out Smoke from the Fire, for which there is a Place made in the Middle between the two Beds. The Marks of the Workman's Tool appear every-where; and the Tradition of the Vulgar is, that a Giant and his Wife had this Stone for their Habitation; tho' the Door alone deſtroys this Fancy, which is wholly groundleſs every way beſides. Juſt by it is a clear and pleaſant Spring, for the Uſe of the Inhabitant.</p>
               <p>From the Top of theſe Hills the Sun is to be ſeen all Night about the Summer Solſtice. On the North Part of this Iſland are a Church, a Gentleman's Seat, and ſeveral Farm-houſes, as alſo divers Lakes, which abound with Fiſh, eſpecially Trouts.</p>
               <p>Three Miles from <hi>South Ronalſay</hi> lies BURRA, three Miles long, and one broad, fruitful in Corn and Paſturage, and affords excellent Fewel. <hi>Stewart</hi> of <hi>Mains</hi> built a noble and ſumptuous Stone Houſe here. This Iſle abounds with Rabbets, and has a Chapel, but belongs to the Pariſh of <hi>South Ronal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.</hi>

               <p>Near this lie FAIRA, CAVA, and GRANSEY, fruitful and pleaſant, tho' ſmall Iſlands.</p>
               <p>We paſs by ſeveral <hi>Holms,</hi> as they call them, which are left for Paſturage; and come to POMONA, the largeſt of the <hi>Orkney</hi> Iſlands, and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon called <hi>The Main-land</hi>; it is 24 Miles long; in ſome Places nine, and in others ſix Miles broad; it is very fruitful, and well inhabited; tho' there are no Trees in all theſe Iſlands, but what grow in the Biſhop's Gardens at <hi>Kirkwall,</hi> in this Iſland, the only Town in <hi>Orkney,</hi> a Royal Borough, long poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> pleaſantly ſituated upon a Bay, near the Middle of it; it is about a Mile in Length, and is the Seat of Juſtice, where the Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> keep their Courts. It conſiſts of one Street, which is narrow; but the Houſes are well built, and moſt of them covered with Slate. The Crown had formerly a very ſtrong Caſtle here, which is now in Ruins. Near the Caſtle ſtands a ſtately Houſe, formerly the Biſhop's Seat; and near to that a Palace, which was begun by <hi>Patrick Stewart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> in the Year 1574. but not finiſhed, becauſe of his untimely Death: Several Rooms of it have been curiouſly painted with Scripture Stories. At the North-end of the Town is a Fort built by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> during <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>'s Adminiſtration, ditch'd about with a Breaſtwerk, and other Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, on which they have ſome Canon planted, for the Defence of the Harbour. There is a ſtately Cathedral Church here, called by the Name of <hi>St. Magnus,</hi> who, the Natives ſay, was their firſt Apoſtle: it is very magnificent for this Part of the World, and built of hewn Stone, excellently
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0141100404:287" rendition="simple:additions"/>
poliſhed; it has fourteen Pillars on each Side, and a Steeple erected on four larger Pillars in the Middle, with fine Bells in it: there are ſo many Turnings, that it is hard for a Stranger to find the ſame Way out or in. Here is a publick Grammar-ſchool; they have a Charter for two weekly Markets, and an annual Fair, which holds three Days. The Town is governed by a Provoſt, four Bailiffs, and a Common-council. This Iſland has nine Pariſh-churches, many Promontories and Bays, and ſeveral Mines of good white and black Lead; it has alſo ſeveral Gentlemens Seats, and divers Lakes and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets, which abound with Salmon and other Fiſh. It has four very good Harbours; <hi>viz.</hi> one at <hi>Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> both large and ſafe; another at <hi>Deerſound,</hi> very large, with good Anchorage, and capable of receiving the greateſt Fleets; the third is at <hi>Graham</hi>'s <hi>Hall</hi>; and the fourth at <hi>Kerſton,</hi> which is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and well fenced againſt all Winds. In this Iſland are two Temples, where the Natives believe by Tradition, that the Sun and Moon were worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; which Belief of theirs is very right, ſince the leſſer Temple is ſemicircular. The greater is 110 Paces diameter. There are two green Mounts erected at the Eaſt and Weſt-end of it; and round each of the Temples a Trench or Ditch is drawn, like that about <hi>Stone-kenge.</hi> Many of the Stones are about 20 or 24 Feet in Height above the Ground, about five in Breadth, and a Foot or two in Thickneſs. Some of them are fallen down; and the Temples are one on the Eaſt, and the other on the Weſt-ſide of the Lake of <hi>Stennis,</hi> where it is ſhallow and fordable, there being a Paſſage over by large ſtepping Stones. Near the ſmaller Temple (which is on the Eaſt-ſide of the Lake, as the greater on the Weſt) ſtand two Stones of the ſame Bigneſs with the reſt; thro' the Middle of one of which runs a large Hole, by which Criminals and Victims were tyed.</p>

                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0141100404:288"/>Eaſt from <hi>The Main-land</hi> lies COPPINSHA, a ſmall Iſland, but fruitful in Corn and Graſs, has good Fiſhing, and abounds with Fowl; it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to Seamen, as is the Holm to the North-eaſt of it, called <hi>The Horſe of Coppinſha.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>To the South-eaſt lies STRONSA, ſix Miles long, and three broad, well known, becauſe of its good Harbours, to thoſe who frequent this Country and <hi>Shetland</hi> for Fiſhing: it is very fruitful, and well inhabited, and has a Rock belonging to it called <hi>Outkerrie,</hi> remarkable for its good Fiſhery.</p>
               <p>A little North of it lies a little pleaſant Iſle, called PAPA STRONSA, very fruitful, and well inhabited.</p>
               <p>Farther North lies SANDA, about 12 Miles long, and eight Miles broad, well inhabited, and has two Harbours; it abounds with Cattle, Hay, and Fiſh; but the Inhabitants are obliged to bring their Fewel from EDA, which lies Eaſt of it: It is ten Miles long, and in ſome Places five Miles broad; there is good Salt made here, and it abounds with Fiſh and Fowl, but not with Corn and Graſs.</p>
               <p>Three Miles Weſt from <hi>Kirkwall</hi> lies DAMSEY, a ſmall, but fruitful Iſland, and abounds with Fiſh.</p>

               <p>There are ſeveral other Iſlands in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which are fruitful enough for their Extent.</p>
               <p>Eight Miles North from <hi>Kirkwall</hi> lies EGLISHA, three Miles long, and two broad; it has a ſafe Road for Ships, is very pleaſant and fruitful, and has a Pariſh-church.</p>

                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0141100404:289"/>Five Miles North-eaſt lies NORTH-FARA, three Miles long; it is but thinly inhabited, but affords the common Commodities of the Country.</p>
               <p>SOUTH-FARA, which lies near <hi>Burra,</hi> is much of the ſame Extent and Nature.</p>
               <p>North from <hi>Egliſha</hi> lies WESTRA, eight Miles long, in ſome Places five, and in others three Miles broad; it is well inhabited, abounds with Corn, Cattle, Fiſh and Rabbets, has a ſtrong Caſtle, with a convenient Harbour.</p>

In this Iſland ſtand, near a Lake, (now called <hi>St. Tredwell's Loch</hi>) two Obeliſks, in one of which is a Hole uſed by the Heathens for the Tying of Criminals and Victims; and behind them, lying on the Ground, a third Stone, hollowed like a Trough.</p>
               <p>The People of the <hi>Orcades</hi> are generally health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſtout, and well proportioned; they are more numerous than can reaſonably be imagined. <hi>Bleau,</hi> in his <hi>Atlas,</hi> ſays, they muſtered 10000 Men at once, near <hi>Kirkwall,</hi> fit to carry Arms, beſides thoſe that were left to cultivate the Ground. The Commodities which they export yearly, are Butter, Tallow, Hides, Barley, Malt, Oatmeal, Fiſh, ſalted Beef, Pork, Rabbet-ſkins, Otter-ſkins, white Salt, Stuffs, Stockens, Wool, Hams, Quills, Down, Feathers, <hi>&amp;c. Molucca</hi> Beans, figured Stones, and peculiar Sorts of Fiſh and Fowls are found here. The <hi>Claik</hi> Geeſe, or <hi>Barnacles,</hi> which are reckoned to breed in the Trunks of Trees, or in the Timber of old Ships, and have been ſo frequently ſeen about theſe and the neighbouring Iſlands, have occaſioned abundance of Wrangling among the Learned. Some of them have denied the Matter of Fact, and boldly aſſerted, there could be no ſuch thing in Nature, as
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0141100404:290"/>
that Birds ſhould proceed from Trees; others, who could not reſiſt the Evidence of ſo many Perſons of Credit, who had ſeen and atteſted the hanging of Birds of that ſort to the Trunks of Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have had recourſe to ſuch ſtrange Philoſophical Notions for explaining this Phaenomenon, as ſtill made the thing more ridiculous and incredible. But there are two ways to ſolve this Difficulty, found out by modern Authors, both of which ſeem very probable: The firſt is the <hi>Concha Anatifera,</hi> mentioned by Sir <hi>Robert Sibbald,</hi> in his <hi>Natural Hiſtory of</hi> Scotland, <hi>Book</hi> III. <hi>Part</hi> ii. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. wherein he ſays, that thoſe Shells ſtick to Sea-ware, or Logs of Fir, and ſuck Nouriſhment from them; that the Animal contained in thoſe Shells, is a Fiſh, but unſhapely, and ſends out ſuch a Multitude of Feet, as reſemble Hair, which the unwary Obſerver takes for Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and of this Animal Sir <hi>Robert</hi> has given us a Cut in the End of his Book. Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Orkney,</hi> has done the like, and tells us, he has ſeen ſome Thouſands of thoſe <hi>Conchae,</hi> ſticking to Logs of Wood driven aſhore in that Country. But the Solution given by a late Author, in his <hi>Curioſities of Nature and Art in Huſbandry and Gardening,</hi> lately printed at <hi>London,</hi> p. 311. ſeems ſtill to be more plain, if the Fact be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Barnacles</hi> lay their Eggs as Fiſh do theirs, and leave them at the Mercy of the Waves; and that as they float, they ſtick to what they meet, eſpecially rotten Wood, Sea-ware, and other mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Plants, upon which we may obſerve a glutinous Subſtance; and that they are hatched there by the Heat of the Sun.</p>
               <p>The People of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> generally ſpeaking, are very civil and induſtrious, hoſpitable, ſober, and religiouſly diſpoſed. Tho' the Air be ſharp and cold, yet it may be called temperate. They are generally long-lived, the Women handſome, bearing Children
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0141100404:291"/>
ſometimes at ſixty Years. They are ſeldom afflicted with Fevers, Stone, or Gout; but are often liable to the Scurvy, Agues, and Conſumptions. They generally ſpeak the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue after the <hi>Scots</hi> way; but many antient People of the poorer Sort, ſpeak the <hi>Norn,</hi> or <hi>Norway,</hi> or old <hi>Daniſh</hi> Tongue, which has been continued from the firſt Planters of theſe Iſlands. They have plenty of Black Cattle, Sheep, Swine, Rabbets, Geeſe, and ſeveral ſorts of Fiſh. They export great Quantities of Oil, Butter, and ſalt Fleſh, which turn to good Account. Their Corn-land is every-where incloſed; and without theſe Incloſures their Sheep and Swine, and moſt of their Cattle, go looſe, without an Herdſman.</p>
               <p>They formerly had their own Kings, after the Manner of the <hi>Picts,</hi> who were haraſſed by the <hi>Romans</hi>; but by the Injury of Time, or Negligence of Writers, only two are come to the Knowledge of Poſterity, <hi>viz.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0141100404:292"/>
of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> who claimed the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty; and, in ſome meaſure, continued poſſeſſed of it, till the Marriage of King <hi>James</hi> III. with a Daughter of <hi>Denmark,</hi> when they were firſt mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for a great Sum, due then by the Contract; and thereafter, upon her bringing forth a Son (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards King <hi>James</hi> IV.) the intire Right to them was ſurrendered to King <hi>James</hi> III. which was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed to King <hi>James</hi> VI. upon his marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Anne</hi> his Queen, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Daughter. The Earldom of <hi>Orkney,</hi> and Lordſhip of <hi>Zetland,</hi> continued in the Crown, till Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> being to marry <hi>James Hepburn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> by fatal Advice of her Privy Council, advanced him to the Dignity of Duke of <hi>Orkney.</hi> After his Death, King <hi>James</hi> VI. created a natural Son of King <hi>James</hi> V. Earl; which failing in his Son, it returned to the Crown: and, <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. <hi>William Dowglaſs,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> having advanced, as he ſaid, great Sums to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. procured this Country in Mortgage for his Money; but it was redeemed, and, by Act of Parliament, all re-annexed to the Crown, <hi>Anno</hi> 1669. excepting what belonged to the Biſhop; which Act ſuppreſſed the Office of <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and erected one with a different Name, <hi>viz.</hi> to be called, <hi>The Stewartry of</hi> Orkney <hi>and</hi> Zetland. But the ſaid Country, by the Union-Parliament, was diſſolved from the Crown, and her late Majeſty thereupon granted the ſame to the then Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> for Payment of the yearly Sum of 500<hi>l.</hi> and appointed him Steward and Juſticier within the Bounds thereof. Under the Stewards are ſome Judges of his Creation and Appointment, called <hi>Bailiffs:</hi> In every Pariſh and Iſle there is one. Their Office is to overſee the Manners of the Inhabitants, to hold Courts, and to determine in Civil Matters, to the Value of 10<hi>l. Scots</hi> (16<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d. Engliſh</hi>); but if the Matter be above, it is referred to the Steward,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0141100404:293"/>
or his Deputy. Under and ſubſervient to thoſe Bailiffs, are ſix or ſeven of the moſt honeſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Perſons within the Pariſh, called <hi>Lawright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> Theſe, in their reſpective Bounds, have the Overſight of the People, in manner of Conſtables, and inform the Bailiff of ſuch Enormities as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally happen, which the latter puniſhes according to the Importance and Circumſtances of the Fault; and if it be above his Limits, or the Extent of his Power, he ſends the Delinquent to the Seat of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> which is held, as we hinted, at <hi>Kirkwall,</hi> by the Steward, or his Deputy. Theſe <hi>Lawrightmen</hi> have a Privilege inherent to their Office, by the Cuſtom of the Country, which is not uſual elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and this is, if there be any Suſpicion of Theft, they take ſome of their Neighbours with them, during the Silence of the Night, and make Search for the Theft, which is called <hi>Ranſacking,</hi> from <hi>Ranſaka,</hi> which is to make Inquiry, in the antient <hi>Daniſh:</hi> they ſearch every Houſe they come to, and ſeizing him upon whom the Theft is found, bring him to the Seat of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Religion was not only preached, but planted very early in theſe Iſles: for we find <hi>Servanus</hi> (or St. <hi>Serf</hi>) was their Biſhop, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor to the famous <hi>Kentigern,</hi> (whom, in a familiar way, he called <hi>Mongah,</hi> or <hi>Mungo,</hi> in his vulgar Tongue) who founded the Biſhoprick of <hi>St. Aſaph</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> about the Year 560. and who had been alſo Biſhop of <hi>Glaſgow.</hi> And, <hi>Anno</hi> 1071. the People of <hi>Orkney</hi> ſent one of their Clergy to <hi>York,</hi> with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, deſiring that Archbiſhop (who was then, in <hi>Fact,</hi> poſſeſſed of a Juriſdiction over the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>) to conſecrate him to be their Biſhop. The laſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> Biſhop was <hi>Adam Hepburn,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Reformation, and lived many Years after it. He was an eminent Man in his Time, a Lord of Council and Seſſion; he crowned King
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0141100404:294"/>
                  <hi>James</hi> VI. was Father to the Lord <hi>Holy-rood-houſe,</hi> where he was Abbot, and where his Tomb remains to this Day. The brave Lieutenant General <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> Field Marſhal of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> lately deceaſed, was Earl of <hi>Orkney.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighty Miles farther North lie the Iſles of SHET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND; betwixt them lies the FAIR ISLE, which riſes up in three high Promontories, and is ſeen both in <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Shetland.</hi> They lie in 61 and 62 Degrees of North Latitude, and have <hi>Norway</hi> on the Eaſt, which is the neareſt Part of the Continent of <hi>Europe.</hi> There are in all Forty-ſix Iſlands, Forty Holms, or leſſer Iſles, left for Paſturage, and Thirty Rocks frequented only by Fowl.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Iſlands, called THE MAIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, is 60 Miles long, and, in ſome Places, 16 broad: it runs into the Sea with abundance of Promontories: it is beſt inhabited, and cultivated, on the Shore; but the inner Part is mountainous, and full of Lakes or Bogs, which makes travelling there to Strangers dangerous. The Air is cool and piercing; yet many of the Inhabitants live to a great Age. About the Summer Solſtice they have ſo much Light all Night, that they can ſee to read by it. The Sun ſets between Ten and Eleven at Night, and riſes between One and Two in the Morning; and, on the other hand, the Day is ſo much ſhorter, and the Night longer in the Winter; which, with the Violence of the Tides, and the Tempeſtuouſneſs of the Seas, deprives them of all foreign Correſpondence from <hi>October</hi> to <hi>April,</hi> during which Time they know nothing of what paſſes in the other Parts of the World. A known Inſtance of this was, that tho' the Revolution happened to begin in <hi>November,</hi> they knew nothing of it till the <hi>May</hi> following, when a Fiſherman, who arrived there, told them of it; and then they impriſoned him, in order to try him for ſpreading ſuch News.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0141100404:295"/>They are much ſubject to the Scurvy, by eating too much Fiſh; but Nature has furniſhed them with great Quantities of Scurvygraſs for an Antidote. They have little Corn of their own Growth, and therefore import great Quantities from <hi>Orkney.</hi> Their common Drink is Whey, which they barrel up, and keep in cold Cellars; this makes it very ſtrong, ſo that it quickly turns their Heads. Some of them keep for their Drink Butter-milk mixed with Water, and this they call <hi>Bland.</hi> The better Sort have good Beer and Ale, of which they are very liberal to Strangers. They have abundance of the Fiſh of all Sorts on their Coaſts for moſt Part of the Year: thoſe that abound moſt are Cod, Ling, and Herring. They have alſo Shell-fiſh of all Sorts, with Whales, Seals, Sea-calves, and Otters; and in the Winter-time they burn Oil of Fiſh inſtead of Candle. They abound with all Sorts of Fowl, except Heath-cocks; and other Fowls which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Heaths, will not live there when brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho' they have abundance of Heath. They have Store of Geeſe, and many Sorts of Ducks. They have Plenty of little Horſes, which they call <hi>Schelties,</hi> very fit for the Huſbandman's Uſe, and pace naturally. They make coarſe Cloth, Stockens, and knit Gloves for their own Uſe, and alſo for Sale to the <hi>Norwegians.</hi> Their Grain is Oats and Big, but moſt of the latter. They have abundance of Black Cattle and Sheep. Their Ewes are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifick, and for the moſt part bring forth two, and ſometimes three Lambs at once. Their Fewel is Turf, Peat, and Heath. Their chief Trade of Export conſiſts in Fiſh, by the Produce of which they pay their Rent, and purchaſe Neceſſaries. Their native Language is old <hi>Gothick,</hi> or <hi>German,</hi> as was alſo that of <hi>Orkney</hi>; but they generally now ſpeak <hi>Engliſh.</hi> In their Cuſtoms and Habit they much reſemble the <hi>Germans,</hi> but the better Sort
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0141100404:296"/>
imitate the <hi>Scots Lowlanders.</hi> Their Religion is Proteſtant, and they are generally, as well as the <hi>Orkney-men,</hi> very devout. There were few or no Preſbyterians in theſe Parts before the Year 1700. when new Miſſionaries came, and ejected the old Clergy; yet the People did not care to hear them, ſo long as they had any body elſe. They make uſe of no Phyſicians; and if at any time they receive Wounds, they cure themſelves. There are two little Towns in this Iſland; the firſt and oldeſt is <hi>Scalloway,</hi> on the Weſt-ſide of the Iſland, where there is a Caſtle four Stories high: the Inhabitants are about an hundred in Number. The ſecond and largeſt is <hi>Lerwick,</hi> which by their Fiſhing-trade is increaſed now to about three hundred Families.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral antient Monuments in theſe Iſlands, and particularly thoſe called <hi>Picts Houſes,</hi> which we have not room to inſiſt upon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch, Hamburghers,</hi> &amp;c. come hither to fiſh in <hi>June,</hi> and go away again in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September</hi>; and ſometimes there are two thouſand Buſſes fiſhing in <hi>Braſſa</hi>'s Sound at once.</p>
               <p>The moſt remarkable of the other Iſlands here, are, ZEAL, commonly called YELL, eighteen Miles long, and nine broad: it has three Churches, and ſeveral Chapels. And,</p>
               <p>Farther North lies VUIST, much of the ſame Dimenſions, plain, pleaſant to the Eye, fruitful, and well inhabited. It is the pleaſanteſt of the <hi>Shetland</hi> Iſles, has three Churches, and as many Harbours. The Inhabitants ſay, no Cats will live in it.</p>
               <p>TRONDA lies over-againſt <hi>Scalloway</hi>; it is three Miles long, and two broad.</p>
               <p>A little North-eaſt lies WALSEY, three Miles long, and as many broad.</p>
               <p>On the Eaſt of <hi>Braſſa</hi>'s Sound lies GREAT RULE, eight Miles long, and two broad: it has a good Harbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0141100404:297"/>Six Leagues Weſt from <hi>The Main-land</hi> lies FOULA, three Miles in Length.</p>
               <p>More to the Eaſt lies BRASA, five Miles long, and two broad: it has ſome arable Ground, and two Churches.</p>
               <p>BURRAY is three Miles long, has good Paſturage, abounds with Fiſh on the Coaſt, and has a Church in it. No Mice will live here; and, 'tis ſaid, they forſake the Place, where-ever the Earth of it is brought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shetland</hi> is divided into twelve Pariſhes; but there are many more Churches and Chapels in it. This Country, like <hi>Orkney,</hi> has no Wood in it; but they have ſome Fiſh and Fowl peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Inhabitants are very bold in venturing to Sea at all Seaſons for Fiſh, and in climbing the Rocks for Fowl.</p>
               <p>It has been debated among the Learned, whether theſe Iſlands, the <hi>Orcades,</hi> or the North-eaſt Coaſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was the THULE of the Antients; but we have not room to give an Account of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the ſeveral Hypotheſes, nor to conſider which of them are moſt concluſive; tho' it ought to be obſerved, that Sir <hi>Robert Sibbald</hi> has in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner demonſtrated, that the North-eaſtern Parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> were what the Antients called ſo.

               <p>The chief Families in <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Shetland</hi> are the <hi>Bruces, Sinclairs, Mouats, Nivets, Chyneys, Stuarts, Grahams, Moodies, Dowglaſſes, Honeymans, Trails, Bakies, Southerlands, Craigies, Youngs, Buchanans, &amp;c.</hi> But the moſt antient, and, I may ſay, original, are the <hi>Fletts, Hackrews, Richens, Feas, Skolas, Grottes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the Mouth of the River FORTH lie ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Iſlands, the moſt conſiderable of which is the MAY: it was formerly dedicated to St. <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was martyred there by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and afterwards a religious Place was built in Memory of him. The Monks gave out, that barren Women, who came thither annually to worſhip at St. <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Shrine, would thereby be cured of their Barrenneſs; and it was frequented upon that Account by Women in the Popiſh Times. But whether St. <hi>Adrian</hi> or the Monks had the moſt Influence in curing their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, I determine not. Yet that fond, ſilly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion obtained ſo much Credit, that <hi>Wood,</hi> of <hi>Largo,</hi> who was a noted Sea Captain, had a Charter of ſeveral Lands from King <hi>James</hi> IV. to be in Readineſs upon Call to attend his Majeſty and the Queen while they viſited St. <hi>Adrian.</hi> This Iſland is a Mile long from North to South, and about a Quarter of a Mile broad: it lies ſeven Miles from
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0141100404:299"/>
the Coaſt of <hi>Fife,</hi> has a freſh-water Spring, and a ſmall Lake. There grows no Corn here; but in the Summer it affords Paſturage for an hundred Sheep, and twenty Black Cattle. The Weſt-ſide is inacceſſible, becauſe of high Rocks; but the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide is plain, and has four Places where Boats may arrive, one of them a ſafe Harbour for Ships during a ſtrong Weſt Wind. Fiſh of all Sorts are numerous on the Coaſt of this Iſland, and it abounds with Fowl, particularly thoſe called Skarts, Dunters, Gulls, Scouts, and Kittawaax; the latter is about the Size of a Dove, and in <hi>July</hi> is prefer'd to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge. The Scouts are ſomewhat leſs than a Duck, but their Eggs are larger than thoſe of a Gooſe, and being boiled hard, eat very well with Vinegar and Parſley. This Iſland of <hi>May</hi> formerly belonged to the Priory of <hi>Pittenweem,</hi> but was granted in Fee by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. to <hi>Cunningham</hi> of <hi>Barns,</hi> with Liberty to build a Light-houſe there for the Benefit of Ships; for the Maintenance of which they were to allow 2<hi>d. per</hi> Tun. A Tower of 40 Foot high is built there for that End, with a Fire every Night; and the firſt Builder was caſt away, in returning from thence to his Houſe in <hi>Fife,</hi> by a Tempeſt which ſome poor old Women were executed for raiſing.</p>
               <p>The BASS lies next; but I have given an Account of it already.</p>
               <p>Higher up in the <hi>Forth</hi> lies INCHKEITH, betwixt <hi>Fife</hi> and <hi>Lothian,</hi> a Mile and a half long, and about half a Mile broad: the Soil is fat, and produces good Graſs, and abundance of phyſical Herbs. It has four freſh-water Springs, and as many Harbours, one towards each Quarter: it riſes in the Middle, and has a ſtrong Stone Fort raiſed upon it by Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> There is a Stone Quarry here, which ſends forth a ſtrong ſulphurous Smell, when any Pieces are broken off, but very fit for Building. There are
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0141100404:300"/>
great Shoals of Fiſh round the Coaſts of this Iſland, and abundance of Oyſters during the Winter. This Iſland had its Name from the noble Family of <hi>Keith,</hi> whoſe Founder had this Iſland, with the Barony of <hi>Ceith-mareſchal</hi> in <hi>Lothian,</hi> and the Hereditary Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Earl Mareſchal of <hi>Scotland</hi> conferr'd upon him by King <hi>Malcolm</hi> II. in the Year 1010. for his Valour in the Battle againſt the <hi>Danes</hi> at <hi>Bar</hi> in <hi>Angus.</hi> It came afterwards to the Crown, and was given by King <hi>Robert</hi> II. to <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Lyon</hi> of <hi>Glames,</hi> the Chief of that Family, with the Barony of <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> upon his marrying that Prince's Daughter. It is ſince in other Hands. It is obſerved, that Horſes grow fat here in a little time.</p>
               <p>Higher up, within two Miles of <hi>Aberdour,</hi> lies an Iſland, called ST. COLM'S INCH, as being dedicated to St. <hi>Columba:</hi> it had formerly a famous Abbey, with large Endowments, but it is now ruined; and upon the Alienation of Abbey Lands, was given to the Lord <hi>Downs,</hi> a Branch of the Family of <hi>Stuart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Higher up lies INCHGARVY, between two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories, near the <hi>Queen's Ferry</hi>; it was alſo fortified, and the Guns of the Forts could reach the Shore or both Sides, ſo that no Ships could ſafely paſs it without Leave.</p>
               <p>On the Top of an high rocky Hill, at the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of the Iſlands of <hi>Orkney,</hi> near the Village of <hi>Skeal,</hi> there is a ſort of Pavement conſiſting of Stones variouſly figured, ſome like an Heart, others like a Crown, a Leg, a Weaver's Shuttle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It takes up above a Quarter of a Mile in Length, and from 20 to 30 Feet in Breadth. In removing any of theſe Stones, the Figure is as neat on the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as the Upper, and being as big as the Life, all of one Colour, or a reddiſh Kind of Stone, pitched in a reddiſh Earth, and the Pavemen ſo very long, it cannot be any of the teſſellated or chequer'd
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0141100404:301"/>
Works of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Part of a Garden Wall is decorated with theſe Stones, and many of them are taken away by the neighbouring Gentry, to ſet them up like <hi>Dutch</hi> Tiles in their Chimneys; ſo that, at this rate, in leſs than a Century, this Pavement will in all likelihood ſubſiſt only in Books.</p>
               <p>It has been long obſerved, that the Iſlands of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> eſpecially the Weſtern, lie more conveniently for carrying on, and bringing the Fiſhing-trade to Perfection, than any other Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> I. began the Experiment, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with a Company of Merchants; but that Deſign miſcarried by the Civil War, which unhappily broke out at that Time. The next At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was made by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. who alſo joined with ſome Merchants; and this ſucceeded well for a Time. Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> aſſures us, from ſuch as ſaw the Fiſh that were caught by that Company, that they were reputed the beſt in <hi>Europe</hi> of their Kind, and accordingly bore a greater Price. But this Deſign was ruin'd thus: The King having Occaſion for Money, was adviſed to withdraw that which was employ'd in the Fiſhery; at which the Merchants being diſpleaſed, and diſagreeing likewiſe among themſelves, they alſo withdrew their Money, and that Deſign has never been renewed ſince that Time.</p>
               <p>But the Revival of this Undertaking will, in all Probability, be one of the Bleſſings which this Iſland will reap by the late happy Union. What can't <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, and <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Induſtry, effect!</p>
               <p>The ſettling a Fiſhery in thoſe Parts will raiſe a Nurſery of ſtout and able Seamen in a very ſhort time, to ſerve the Government on all Occaſions. A new Colony need not be planted there; for the Inhabitants of the <hi>Weſtern Iſles</hi> are reckoned to be about 50,000; many of whom have no Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are generally dextrous at the Oar, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0141100404:302"/>
only want to be furniſhed with proper Materials for the Fiſhing-trade, which would encourage the ſetting up other Manufactures. The Commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Safety of the numerous Bays and Harbours in thoſe Iſles ſeem as if Nature had deſigned them for promoting Trade. They have ſuch abundance of Turf and Peat for Fewel, as would furniſh Salt-pans with Fire all the Year round. The Coaſt of each Iſland affords many thouſand Loads of Sea-ware, which, if preſerved, might be ſucceſsfully uſed for making Glaſs, and likewiſe Kelp for Soap. Several of the Iſlands afford great Quantities of fine Clay; which, if improved, might turn to a good Account in making Earthen-ware of all Sorts. Cod and Ling, as well as leſſer Fiſh, are to be had on the Coaſts of the leſſer as well as the greater Iſlands; and what has been ſaid of the <hi>Weſtern Iſles,</hi> may be ſaid likewiſe of the Iſles of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Shetland.</hi>
