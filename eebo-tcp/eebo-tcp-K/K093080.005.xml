            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

II. p. 652. obſerved that the publication of this Poem hath been objected to, but without ſufficient reaſon. <q>The irony is ſo obvious, that it cannot well be miſtaken. The fact was, that a young officer, a friend of Mr. Browne's, wanted to carry a miſtreſs with him to his country quarters; and he deſired our author to write a copy of verſes, to perſuade ſome lady of eaſy virtue to comply with his requeſt. Mr. Browne wrote theſe verſes, which were deſigned as a ſtrong ridicule and ſevere reproof of ſuch kind of criminal connections; and they produced an immediate effect; for the young Gentleman gave up all thoughts of his intended companion. The whole muſt be conſidered as written in the character of a rakiſh officer, during a time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found peace. Biſhop Hoadly ſaid, that the verſes would do more good than twenty ſermons; and the late Lord Lyttelton expreſſed a high commendation of their moral tendency.</q>

                  <l>Who ſo did fail—and that was STRAIGHT.</l>

                  <l>Our good forgetful friend at Findon,</l>

               <head>PROLOGUE TO COMUS, Performed for the Benefit of the General Hoſpital at BATH, 1756. BY THE SAME. Spoken by Miſs MORRISON, in the Character of a Lady of Faſhion. She enters with a Number of Tickets in her Hand.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>WELL, I've been beating up for volunteers,</l>
                  <l>But find that—charity has got no ears.</l>
                  <l>I firſt attack'd a colonel of the guards—</l>
                  <l>Sir, charity—conſider its rewards.</l>
                  <l>With healing hand the ſaddeſt ſores it ſkins,</l>
                  <l>And covers—oh!—a multitude of ſins.</l>
                  <l>He ſwore, the world was welcome to his thoughts:</l>
                  <l>'Twas damn'd <hi>hypocriſy</hi> to hide one's faults;</l>
                  <l>And with that ſin his conſcience ne'er was <hi>twitted</hi>—</l>
                  <l>The only one he never had committed</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Next, to my knight I plead. He—ſhook his head;</l>
                  <l>Complain'd the ſtocks were low—and trade was dead.</l>
                  <l>In theſe Bath-charities a tax he'd found</l>
                  <l>More heavy than—four ſhillings in the pound.</l>

                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0394600105:308"/>What with the play-houſe, hoſpital, and abbey,</l>
                  <l>A man was <hi>ſtripp'd</hi>—unleſs he'd look quite ſhabby.</l>
                  <l>Then ſuch a train, and ſuch expence to ſit!</l>
                  <l>My lady, all the brats, and couſin Kit—</l>
                  <l>He'd ſteal, himſelf—perhaps—into the pit.</l>

                  <l>Raffles for Chineſe Gods, card-houſes, ſhells,</l>
                  <l>Nor grudges to the muſic, or the bells,</l>
                  <l>But has a ſtrange <hi>antiquity</hi> to naſty <hi>oſpitels.</hi>
                  </l>

                  <l>I hope your lordſhip—then my lord replies—</l>
                  <l>No doubt, the governors are—very wiſe;</l>
                  <l>But, for the play, he—wonder'd at their choice.</l>
                  <l>In Milton's days ſuch ſtuff might be the taſte,</l>
                  <l>But faith! he thought it was damn'd dull and chaſte.</l>
                  <l>Then ſwears, he to the charity is hearty,</l>
                  <l>But can't, in honour, break his evening party.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When to the gouty alderman I ſued,</l>
                  <l>The naſty fellow ('gad!) was downright rude.</l>
                  <l>Is begging grown the faſhion, with a pox!</l>
                  <l>The mayor ſhould ſet ſuch houſewives in the ſtocks.</l>
                  <l>Give you a guinea! z—ds! replied the beaſt,</l>
                  <l>'Twould buy a ticket for a turtle-feaſt.</l>
                  <l>Think what a guinea a-head might ſet before ye—</l>
                  <l>Sir—mullet—turbot—and a grand John Dorey.</l>
                  <l>I'll never give a groat, as I'm a ſinner,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>THE glow-worm ſcribblers of a feeble age,</l>
                  <l>Pale twinklers of an hour, provoke my rage:</l>
                  <l>In each dark hedge we ſtart an inſect fire,</l>
                  <l>Which lives by night, and muſt at dawn expire;</l>
                  <l>Yet ſuch their number, that their ſpecks combine,</l>
                  <l>And the unthinking vulgar ſwear they ſhine.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Poets are prodigies ſo greatly rare,</l>
                  <l>They ſeem the taſks of heav'n, and built with care:</l>
                  <l>Like ſuns, unquench'd, unrival'd and ſublime,</l>
                  <l>They roll, immortal, o'er the waſtes of time;</l>
                  <l>Ages in vain cloſe round and ſnatch in fame;</l>
                  <l>High over all ſtill ſhines the Poet's name!</l>
                  <l>Lords of a life that ſcorns the bounds of breath,</l>
                  <l>They ſtretch exiſtence, and defy ſtern death.</l>
                  <l>Glory and ſhame are theirs—They plant renown,</l>
                  <l>Or ſhade the Monarch's by the Muſe's crown:</l>
                  <l>To ſay Auguſtus reign'd when Virgil ſhin'd,</l>
                  <l>Does honour to the lord of half mankind.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So when three thouſand years have wan'd away,</l>
                  <l>And POPE is ſaid to have liv'd when GEORGE bore ſway,</l>
                  <l>Millions ſhall lend the King the Poet's fame,</l>
