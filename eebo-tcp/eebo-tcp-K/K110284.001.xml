            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A GREAT part of the Poetical Works of Mr. Shen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, particularly his Elegies and Paſtorals, are (as he himſelf expreſſes it) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The exact tranſcripts of the ſituation of his own mind,"</q> and abound in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent alluſions to his own place, the beautiful ſcene of his retirement from the world. Excluſively, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of our natural curioſity to be acquainted with the hiſtory of an author whoſe Works we peruſe with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſome ſhort account of Mr. Shenſtone's perſonal character, and ſituation in life, may not only be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but abſolutely neceſſary, to the reader, as it is impoſſible he ſhould enter into the true ſpirit of his writings if he is entirely ignorant of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his life, which ſometimes ſo greatly influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his reflections.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh, however, that this taſk had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to ſome perſon capable of performing it in that maſterly manner which the ſubject ſo well deſerves. To confeſs the truth, it was chiefly to prevent his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains from falling into the hands of any one ſtill leſs qualified to do him juſtice, that I have unwillingly ventured to undertake the publication of them myſelf.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shenſtone was the eldeſt ſon of a plain unedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated gentleman in Shropſhire, who farmed his own eſtate. The father, ſenſible of his ſon's extraordinary capacity, reſolved to give him a learned education,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0183800601:6"/>
and ſent him a commoner to Pembroke College in Oxford, deſigning him for the church; but though he had the moſt awful notions of the wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, of God, he never could be perſuaded to enter into orders. In his private opinions he adhered to no particular ſect, and hated all religious diſputes. But whatever were his own ſentiments, he always ſhewed great tenderneſs to thoſe who differed from him. Tenderneſs, indeed, in every ſenſe of the word, was his peculiar characteriſtic; his friends, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, his poor neighbours, all daily experienced his benevolent turn of mind. Indeed this virtue in him was often carried to ſuch exceſs, that it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bordered upon weakneſs; yet if he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that any of thoſe ranked amongſt the number of his friends had treated him ungenerouſly, he was not eaſily reconciled. He uſed a maxim, however, on ſuch occaſions, which is worthy of being obſerved and imitated; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I never,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"will be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful enemy; but I cannot, it is not in my nature, to be half a friend."</q> He was in his temper quite unſuſpicious, but if ſuſpicion was once awakened in him, it was not laid aſleep again without difficulty.</p>
            <p>He was no economiſt; the generoſity of his temper prevented him from paying a proper regard to the uſe of money: he exceeded, therefore, the bounds of his paternal fortune, which before he died was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably incumbered. But when one recollects the perfect
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0183800601:7"/>
paradiſe he had raiſed around him, the hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with which he lived, his great indulgence to his ſervants, his charities to the indigent, and all done with an eſtate not more than three hundred pounds a-year, one ſhould rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him, than to blame his want of economy. He left, however, more than ſufficient to pay all his debts, and by his will appropriated his whole eſtate for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It was perhaps from ſome conſiderations on the narrowneſs of his fortune that he forbore to marry, for he was no enemy to wedlock, had a high opinion of many among the fair ſex, was fond of their ſociety, and no ſtranger to the tendereſt impreſſions. One, which he received in his youth, was with difficulty ſurmounted. The lady was the ſubject of that ſweet paſtoral, in four parts, which has been ſo univerſally admired; and which, one would have thought, muſt have ſubdued the loftieſt heart, and ſoftened the moſt obdurate.</p>
            <p>His perſon, as to height, was above the middle ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but largely and rather inelegantly formed: his face ſeemed plain till you converſed with him, and then it grew very pleaſing. In his dreſs he was negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent even to a fault, though, when young, at the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, he was accounted a beau. He wore his own hair, which was quite gray very early, in a particular manner; not from any affectation of ſingularity, but from a maxim he had laid down, that without too
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0183800601:8"/>
ſlaviſh a regard to faſhion, every one ſhould dreſs in a manner moſt ſuitable to his own perſon and figure. In ſhort, his faults were only little blemiſhes, thrown in by Nature, as it were on purpoſe, to prevent him from riſing too much above that level of imperfection allotted to humanity.</p>
            <p>His character, as a writer, will be diſtinguiſhed by ſimplicity with elegance, and genius with correctneſs. He had a ſublimity equal to the higheſt attempts; yet, from the indolence of his temper, he choſe rather to amuſe himſelf in culling flowers at the foot of the mount, than to take the trouble of climbing the more arduous ſteeps of Parnaſſus: but whenever he was diſpoſed to riſe, his ſteps, though natural, were noble, and always well ſupported. In the tenderneſs of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giac poetry he hath not been excelled; in the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Paſtoral, one may venture to ſay he had very few equals. Of great ſenſibility himſelf, he never failed to engage the hearts of his readers; and amidſt the niceſt attention to the harmony of his numbers, he always took care to expreſs, with propriety, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of an elegant mind. In all his writings his greateſt difficulty was to pleaſe himſelf. I remember a paſſage in one of his Letters, where, ſpeaking of his Love Songs, he ſays,—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Some were written on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions a good deal imaginary, others not ſo; and the reaſon there are ſo many is, that I wanted to write one good ſong, and could never pleaſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</q> It was this diffidence which occaſioned him

to throw aſide many of his pieces before he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them his laſt touches. I have ſuppreſſed ſeveral on this account; and if, among thoſe which I have ſelected, there ſhould be diſcovered ſome little want of his finiſhing poliſh, I hope it will be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to this cauſe, and, of courſe, be excuſed: yet I flatter myſelf there will always appear ſomething well worthy of having been preſerved: and though I was afraid of inſerting what might injure the character of my friend, yet, as the ſketches of a great maſter are always valuable, I was unwilling the public ſhould loſe any thing material of ſo accompliſhed a writer. In this dilemma it will eaſily be conceived that the taſk I had to perform would become ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult; how I have acquitted myſelf the public muſt judge. Nothing, however, except what he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready publiſhed, has been admitted without the advice of his moſt judicious friends; nothing altered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their particular concurrence. It is impoſſible to pleaſe every one; but 'tis hoped that no reader will be ſo unreaſonable as to imagine that the Author wrote ſolely for his amuſement: his talents were various; and though it may perhaps be allowed that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence chiefly appeared in ſubjects of tenderneſs and ſimplicity, yet he frequently condeſcended to trifle with thoſe of humour and drollery: theſe, indeed he himſelf in ſome meaſure degraded, by the title which he gave them of Levities; but had they been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely rejected, the public would have been deprived
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0183800601:10"/>
of ſome <hi>jeux d'eſprits,</hi> excellent in their kind, and Mr. Shenſtone's character as a writer would have been but imperfectly exhibited.</p>
            <p>But the talents of Mr. Shenſtone were not confined merely to poetry; his character, as a man of clear judgment and deep penetration, will beſt appear from his Proſe Works; it is there we muſt ſearch for the acuteneſs of his underſtanding, and his profound knowledge of the human heart. It is to be lamented, indeed, that ſome things here are unfiniſhed, and can be regarded only as fragments: many are left as ſingle thoughts, but which, like the ſparks of diamonds, ſhew the richneſs of the mine to which they belong; or, like the foot of a Hercules, diſcover the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtrength and extraordinary dimenſions of that hero. I have no apprehenſion of incurring blame from any one for preſerving theſe valuable Remains; they will diſcover to every reader the Author's ſentiments on ſeveral important ſubjects; and there can be very few to whom they will not impart many thoughts which they would never perhaps have been able to draw from the ſource of their own reflections.</p>
            <p>But I believe little need be ſaid to recommend the writings of this gentleman to public attention. His character is already ſufficiently eſtabliſhed; and if he be not injured by the inability of his editor, there is no doubt but he will ever maintain an eminent ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the beſt of our Engliſh writers.</p>

            <head>A PREFATORY ESSAY ON ELEGY.</head>
            <p>IT is obſervable that diſcourſes prefixed to poetry are contrived very frequently to inculcate ſuch tenets as may exhibit the performance to the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: the fabric is very commonly raiſed in the firſt place, and the meaſures by which we are to judge of its merit are afterwards adjuſted.</p>
            <p>There have been few rules given us by the critics concerning the ſtructure of Elegiac poetry; and far be it from the author of the following trifles to dignify his own opinions with that denomination: he would only intimate the great variety of ſubjects, and the different ſtyles<note n="*" place="bottom">This eſſay was written near twenty years ago.</note> in which the writers of Elegy have hitherto indulged themſelves, and endeavour to ſhield the following ones by the latitude of their example.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the etymology of the word<note n="†" place="bottom">ε-λεγειν, ε-particulam dolendi.</note>, the epithet which Horace gives it<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <q>Miſerabiles elegos.
<bibl>Hor.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </note>, or the confeſſion which Ovid makes concerning it<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <q>Heu nimis ex vero nunc tibi nomen erit.
<bibl>Ovid. <hi>de Morte Tibulli.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </q>
               </note>, I think we may conclude thus much however, that Elegy, in its true and genuine acceptation, includes a tender and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous idea; that it looks upon this as its peculiar characteriſtic, and ſo long as this is thoroughly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained, admits of a variety of ſubjects, which by its
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0183800601:12"/>
manner of treating them it renders its own: it throws its melancholyſtole over pretty differentobjects, which, like the dreſſes at a funeral proceſſion, gives them all a kind of ſolemn and uniform appearance.</p>
            <p>It is probable that Elegies were written, at firſt, upon the death of intimate friends and near relations; celebrated beauties, or favourite miſtreſſes: beneficent governors and illuſtrious men: one may add, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of all thoſe who are placed by Virgil in the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel grove of his Elyſium, (<hi>Vide</hi> Hurd's Diſſertation on Horace's Epiſtle)
<q>Quique ſui memores alios ſecere merendo.</q>
After theſe ſubjects were ſufficiently exhauſted, and the ſeverity of fate diſplayed in the moſt affecting inſtances, the poets ſought occaſion to vary their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and the next tender ſpecies of ſorrow that preſented itſelf was the grief of abſent or neglected lovers; and this indulgence might be indeed allowed them, but with this they were not contented: they had obtained a ſmall corner in the province of love, and they took advantage from thence, to overrun the whole territory: they ſung its ſpoils, triumphs, ovations, and rejoicings<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Dicite Io Paean, et Io bis dicite Paean.
<bibl>Ovid.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </note>, as well as the captivity and exequies that attended it: they gave the name of Elegy to their pleaſantries as well as lamentations, till at laſt, through their abundant fondneſs for the myrtle, they forgot that the cypreſs was their peculiar garland.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0183800601:13"/>
In this it is probable they deviated from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſign of Elegy, and it ſhould ſeem that any kind of ſubjects, treated in ſuch a manner as to diffuſe a pleaſing melancholy, might far better deſerve the name than the facetious mirth and libertine feſtivity of the ſucceſsful votaries of Love.</p>
            <p>But, not to dwell too long upon an opinion which may ſeem, perhaps, introduced to favour the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performance, it may not be improper to examine into the uſe and end of Elegy. The moſt important end of all poetry is to encourage virtue. Epic and tragedy chiefly recommend the public virtues; Elegy is of a ſpecies which illuſtrates and endears the private. There is a truly virtuous pleaſure connected with many penſive contemplations, which it is the province and excellency of Elegy to enforce: this, by preſenting ſuitable ideas, has diſcovered ſweets in melancholy which we could not find in mirth, and has led us, with ſucceſs, to the duſty urn, when we could draw no pleaſure from the ſparkling bowl. As Paſtoral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys an idea of ſimplicity and innocence, it is in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular the taſk and merit of Elegy to ſhew the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ſimplicity of rural life to advantage; and that in a way diſtinct from Paſtoral, as much as the plain but judicious landlord may be imagined to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his tenant both in dignity and underſtanding. It ſhould alſo tend to elevate the more tranquil virtues of humility, diſintereſtedneſs, ſimplicity, and innocence:
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0183800601:14"/>
but then there is a degree of elegance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement no way inconſiſtent with theſe rural virtues, and that raiſes Elegy above that <hi>merum rus,</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſhed ruſticity, which has given our Paſtoral writers their higheſt reputation.</p>
            <p>Wealth and ſplendor will never want their proper weight; the danger is leſt they ſhould too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate: a kind of poetry, therefore, which throws its chief influence into the otherſcale, that magnifies the ſweets of liberty and independence, that endears the honeſt delights of love and friendſhip, that celebrates the glory of a good name after death, that ridicules the futile arrogance of birth, that recommends the innocent amuſement of letters, and inſenſibly prepares the mind for that humanity it inculcates; ſuch a kind of poetry may chance to pleaſe, and if it pleaſe, ſhould ſeem to be of ſervice.</p>
            <p>As to the ſtyle of Elegy, it may be well enough determined from what has gone before: it ſhould imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the voice and language of grief, or, if a metaphor of dreſs be more agreeable, it ſhould be ſimple and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, and flowing as a mourner's veil. A verſification, therefore, is deſirable, which, by indulging a free and unconſtrained expreſſion, may admit of that ſimplicity which Elegy requires.</p>
            <p>Heroic metre, with alternate rhyme, ſeems well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough adapted to this ſpecies of poetry; and, however exceptionable upon other occaſions, its inconveniencies
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0183800601:15"/>
appear to loſe their weight in ſhorter Elegies, and its advantages ſeem to acquire an additional importance. The world has an admirable example of its beauty in a collection of Elegies<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>N.B.</hi> This preface was written near twenty years ago.</note> not long ſince publiſhed, the product of a gentleman of the moſt exact taſte, and whoſe untimely death merits all the tears that Elegy can ſhed.</p>
            <p>It is not impoſſible that ſome may think this metre too lax and proſaic; others, that even a more diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute variety of numbers may have ſuperior advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: and in favour of theſe laſt might be produced the example of Milton in his Lycidas, together with one or two recent and beautiful imitations of his verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in that monody. But this kind of argument, I am apt to think, muſt prove too much, ſince the writers I have in view ſeem capable enough of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending any metre they ſhall chuſe; though it muſt be owned alſo, that the choice they make of any is at the ſame time the ſtrongeſt preſumption in its favour.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be no great difficulty to compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the diſpute. There is no one kind of metre that is diſtinguiſhed by rhymes but is liable to ſome objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other. Heroic verſe, where every ſecond line is terminated by a rhyme, (with which the judgment requires that the ſenſe ſhould in ſome meaſure alſo terminate) is apt to render the expreſſion either ſcanty or conſtrained; and this is ſometimes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0183800601:16"/>
in the writings of a poet lately deceaſed, though I believe no one ever threw ſo much ſenſe together, with ſo much eaſe, into a couplet, as Mr Pope: but as an air of conſtraint too often accompanies this metre, it ſeems by no means proper for a writer of Elegy.</p>
            <p>The previous rhyme in Milton's Lycidas is very frequently placed at ſuch a diſtance from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is often dropt by the memory (much better employed in attending to the ſentiment) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be brought to join its partner; and this ſeems to be the greateſt objection to that kind of verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but then the peculiar eaſe and variety it admits of are, no doubt, ſufficient to overbalance the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to give it the preference to any other, in an Elegy of length.</p>
            <p>The chief exception, to which ſtanza of all kinds is liable, is, that it breaks the ſenſe too regularly when it is continued through a long poem; and this may be, perhaps, the fault of Mr. Waller's excellent panegyric. But if this fault be leſs diſcernible in ſmaller compoſitions, as I ſuppoſe it is, I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that the advantages I have before mentioned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from alternate rhyme, (with which ſtanza is, I think, connected) may at leaſt, in ſhorter Elegies, be allowed to outweigh its imperfections.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay but little of the different kinds of Elegy. The melancholy of a lover is different, no doubt, from what we feel on other mixed occaſions. The mind in
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0183800601:17"/>
which love and grief at once predominate is ſoftened to an exceſs. Love-elegy, therefore, is more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of order and deſign, and, being addreſſed chiefly to the ladies, requires little more than tenderneſs and perſpicuity. Elegies that are formed upon promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous incidents, and addreſſed to the world in general, inculcate ſome ſort of moral, and admit a different degree of reaſoning, thought, and order.</p>
            <p>The Author of the following Elegies entered on his ſubjects occaſionally, as particular incidents in life ſuggeſted, or diſpoſitions of mind recommended them to his choice. If he deſcribes a rural landſcape, or unfolds the train of ſentiments it inſpired, he fairly drew his picture from the ſpot, and felt very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the affection he communicates: if he ſpeaks of his humble ſhed, his flocks and his fleeces, he does not counterfeit the ſcene, who having (whether thro' choice or neceſſity is not material) retired betimes to country ſolitudes, and ſought his happineſs in rural employments, has a right to conſider himſelf as a real ſhepherd. The flocks, the meadows, and the grottos, are his own, and the embelliſhment of his farm his ſole amuſement. As the ſentiments, therefore, were inſpired by Nature, and that in the earlier part of his life, he hopes they will retain a natural appearance, diffuſing at leaſt ſome part of that amuſement which, he freely acknowledges, he received from the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0183800601:18"/>
There will appear, perhaps, a real inconſiſtency in the moral tenour of the ſeveral Elegies, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ones may ſometimes ſeem a recantation of the preceding. The reader will ſcarcely impute this to overſight, but will allow that men's opinions, as well as tempers, vary; that neither public nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, active nor ſpeculative, life, are unexceptionably happy, and, conſequently, that any change of opinion concerning them may afford an additional beauty to poetry, as it gives us a more ſtriking repreſentation of life.</p>
            <p>If the Author has hazarded, throughout, the uſe of Engliſh or modern alluſions, he hopes it will not be imputed to an entire ignorance, or to the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of the ancient learning. He has kept the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient plan and method in his eye, though he builds his edifice with the materials of his own nation. In other words, through a fondneſs for his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he has made uſe of the flowers it produced, tho', in order to exhibit them to the greater advantage, he has endeavoured to weave his garland by the beſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del he could find; with what ſucceſs, beyond his own amuſement, muſt be left to judges leſs partial to him than either his acquaintance or his friends.—If any of thoſe ſhould be ſo candid as to approve the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſubjects he has choſen, and the tenderneſs of ſentiment he has endeavoured to impreſs, he begs the metre alſo may not be too ſuddenly condemned. The
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0183800601:19"/>
public ear, habituated of late to a quicker meaſure, may perhaps conſider this as heavy and languid; but an objection of that kind may gradually loſe its force, if this meaſure ſhould be allowed to ſuit the nature of Elegy.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould happen to be conſidered as an objection, with others, that there is too much of a moral caſt diſſuſed through the whole, it is replied, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to animate the poetry ſo far as not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this objection too obvious, or to riſk excluding the faſhionable reader; at the ſame time never devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from a fixed principle, that poetry without mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is but the bloſſom of a fruit-tree. Poetry is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, like that ſpecies of plants which may bear at once both fruits and bloſſoms, and the tree is by no means in perfection without the former, however it may be embelliſhed by the flowers which ſurround it.</p>

            <p>THE Leaſowes is ſituate in the pariſh of Hales Owen, a ſmall market-town in the county of Salop, but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by other counties, and thirty miles from Shrewſbury, as it is near ten to the borders of Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. Though a paternal eſtate, it was never diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for any peculiar beauties till the time of its late owner. It was reſerved for a perſon of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity both to diſcover and improve them, which he has done ſo effectually, that it is now conſidered as amongſt the principal of thoſe delightful ſcenes which perſons of taſte, in the preſent age, are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee. Far from violating its natural beauties, Mr. Shenſtone's only ſtudy was to give them their full effect; and although the form in which things now

appear be indeed the conſequence of much thought and labour, yet the hand of Art is no way viſible ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſhape of ground, the diſpoſition of trees, or (which are here ſo numerous and ſtriking) the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic fall of his caſcades.</p>
            <p>But I will now proceed to a more particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. About half a mile ſhort of Hales Owen, in your way from Birmingham to Bewdley, you quit the great road, and turn into a green lane on the left hand, where, deſcending in a winding manner to the bottom of a deep valley finely ſhaded, the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that occurs is a kind of ruinated wall, and a ſmall gate, within an arch, inſcribed, <q rend="inline">"The Priory Gate."</q> Here, it ſeems, the company ſhould proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begin their walk, but generally chuſe to go up with their horſes or equipage to the houſe, from whence returning, they deſcend back into the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. Paſſing through a ſmall gate at the bottom of the fine ſwelling lawn that ſurrounds the houſe, you enter upon a winding path, with a piece of water on your right. The path and water, overſhadowed with trees that grow upon the ſlopes of this narrow dingle, render the ſcene at once cool, gloomy, ſolemn, and ſequeſtered, and form ſo ſtriking a contraſt to the lively ſcene you have juſt left, that you ſeem all on a ſudden landed in a ſubterraneous kind of region. Winding forward down the valley, you paſs beſide a ſmall root-houſe, where, on a tablet, are theſe lines:<q>

            <p>You now proceed a few paces down the valley to another bench, where you have this caſcade in front, which, together with the internal arch and other appendages, make a pretty irregular picture. I muſt obſerve, once for all, that a number of theſe protem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore benches (two ſtumps with a tranſverſe board) ſeem chiefly intended as hints to ſpectators, leſt in paſſing curſorily through the farm they might ſuffer any of that immenſe variety the place furniſhes to eſcape their notice. The ſtream attending us, with its agreeable murmurs, as we deſcend along this pleaſing valley, we come next to a ſmall ſeat, where we have a ſloping grove upon the right, and on the left a ſtriking viſta to the ſteeple of Hales Owen,
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:0183800601:25"/>
which is here ſeen in a new light. We now deſcend farther down this ſhady and ſequeſtered valley, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied on the right by the ſame brawling rivulet running over pebbles, till it empties itſelf into a fine piece of water at the bottom. The path here wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the left conforms to the water before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, running round the foot of a ſmall hill, and accompanying this ſemicircular lake into another winding valley, ſomewhat more open, and not leſs pleaſing, than the former: however, before we enter this, it will be proper to mention a ſeat about the centre of this water-ſcene, where the ends of it are loſt in the two vallies on each ſide, and in front it is inviſibly connected with another piece of water, of about twenty acres, open to Mr. Shenſtone, but not his property. This laſt was a performance of the monks, and part of a prodigious chain of fiſh-ponds that belonged to Hales Abbey. The back ground of this ſcene is very beautiful, and exhibits a picture of villages and varied ground finely held up to the eye.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak of all this as already finiſhed, but through ſome misfortune in the mound that pounds up the water it is not completed.</p>
            <p>We now leave The Priory upon the left, which is not meant for an object here, and wind along into the other valley: and here I cannot but take notice of the judgment which formed this piece of water; for although it be not very large, yet, as it is formed
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0183800601:26"/>
by the concurrence of three vallies, in which two of the ends are hid, and in the third it ſeems to join with the large extent of water below, it is, to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, unbounded. I muſt confeſs I never ſaw a more natural bed for water, or any kind of lake that pleaſed me better; but it may be right to mention, that this water, in its full extent, has a yet more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant effect from Mr. Shenſtone's houſe, where it is ſeen to a great advantage. We now, by a pleaſing ſerpentine walk, enter a narrow glade in the valley, the ſlopes on each ſide finely covered with oaks and beeches, on the left of which is a common bench, which affords a retiring place ſecluded from every eye, and a ſhort reſpite, during which the eye repoſes on a fine amphitheatre of wood and thicket.</p>
            <p>We now proceed to a ſeat beneath a prodigiouſly fine canopy of ſpreading oak, on the back of which is this inſcription:

The picture before it is that of a beautiful home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene; a ſmall lawn of well-varied ground, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with hills and well-grown oaks, and embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with a caſt of the piping Faunus, amid trees
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0183800601:27"/>
and ſhrubs on a ſlope upon the left, and on the right, and nearer the eye, with an urn thus inſcribed:
<q>" Ingenio et amicitiae <lb/>" Gvlielmi Somerville."</q>
And on the oppoſite ſide,
<q>" G. S. poſvit, <lb/>" Debita ſpargens lacrima favillam <lb/>" Vatis amici<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>TRANSLATION. <q>To the genius and friendſhip <lb/>of <lb/>WILLIAM SOMERVILLE, <lb/>By W. S. <l>Sprinkling the aſhes of a friendly bard</l>

                     </p>
                  </note>."</q> The ſcene is incloſed on all ſides by trees; in the middle only there is an opening, where the lawn is continued, and winds out of ſight.</p>
            <p>Here entering a gate, you are led through a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of many ſorts of willows, into a large root-houſe, inſcribed to the Right Honourable the Earl of Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. It ſeems that worthy peer was preſent at the firſt opening of the caſcade, which is the principal object from the root-houſe, where the eye is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fairy viſion, conſiſting of an irregular and romantic fall of water, very unuſual, one hundred and fifty yards in continuity; and a very ſtriking ſcene it affords. Other caſcades may poſſibly have the advantage of a greater deſcent and a larger tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; but a more wild and romantic appearance of water, and at the ſame time ſtrictly natural, is what
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:0183800601:28"/>
I never ſaw in any place whatever. This ſcene, tho' comparatively ſmall, is yet aggrandized with ſo much art, that we forget the quantity of water which flows through this cloſe and overſhaded valley, and are ſo much tranſported with the intricacy of ſcene, and the concealed height from whence it flows, that we, without reflection, add the idea of magnificence to that of beauty. In ſhort, it is not but upon reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we find the ſtream is not a Niagara, but rather a water-fall in miniature; and that the ſame artifice, upon a larger ſcale, were there large trees inſtead of ſmall ones, and a river inſtead of a rill, would be capable of forming a ſcene that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the utmoſt of our ideas. But I will not dwell longer upon this inimitable ſcene; thoſe who would admire it properly muſt view it, as ſurely as thoſe that view it muſt admire it beyond almoſt any thing they ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>Proceeding on the right-hand path, the next ſeat affords a ſcene of what Mr. Shenſtone uſed to call his Foreſt ground, conſiſting of wild green ſlopes peeping through dingle, or irregular groupes of trees, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed mixture of ſavage and cultivated ground, held up to the eye, and forming a landſcape fit for the pencil of Salvator Roſa.</p>
            <p>Winding on beſide this lawn, which is over-arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſpreading trees, the eye catches, at intervals, over an intermediate hill, the ſpire of Hales church,
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:0183800601:29"/>
forming here a perfect obeliſk—the urn to Mr. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merville, &amp;c.; and now paſſing through a kind of thicket, we arrive at a natural bower of almoſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular oaks, inſcribed in the manner following:<q>
                  <l>" To Mr. DODSLEY.</l>
                  <l>" Come then, my Friend! thy ſylvan taſte diſplay;</l>
                  <l>" Come hear thy Faunus tune his ruſtic lay:</l>
                  <l>" Ah! rather come, and in theſe dells diſown</l>
                  <l>" The care of other ſtrains, and tune thine own."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>On the bank above it, amid the fore-mentioned ſhrubs, is a ſtatue of the piping Faun, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embelliſhes this ſcene, but is alſo ſeen from the court before the houſe, and from other places: it is ſurrounded by venerable oaks, and very happily ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated. From this bower alſo you look down upon the fore-mentioned irregular ground, ſhut up with trees on all ſides, except ſome few openings to the more pleaſing parts of this groteſque and hilly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The next little bench affords the firſt, but not moſt ſtriking, view of The Priory. It is indeed a ſmall building, but ſeen as it is beneath trees, and its extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity alſo hid by the ſame, it has in ſome ſort the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſolemn appearance of a larger edifice.</p>
            <p>Paſſing through a gate, we enter a ſmall open grove, where the firſt ſeat we find affords a pictureſque view, through trees, of a clump of oaks at a diſtance, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing a little cottage upon a green hill: we thence immediately enter a perfect dome or circular temple of magnificent beeches, in the centre of which it was
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:0183800601:30"/>
intended to place an antique altar, or a ſtatue of Pan. The path ſerpentizing through this open grove, leads us by an eaſy aſcent to a ſmall bench with this motto,<q>
                  <l>— " Me gelidum nemus</l>
                  <l>" Nympharumque leves cum ſatyris chori</l>

                  <bibl>HOR.</bibl>
               </q> which alludes to the retired ſituation of the grove. There is alſo ſeen, through an opening to the left, a pleaſing landſcape of a diſtant hill, with a whited farm-houſe upon the ſummit; and to the right hand a beautiful round ſlope, crowned with a clump of large firs, with a pyramidal ſeat on its centre, to which, after no long walk, the path conduct us.</p>
            <p>But we firſt come to another view of The Priory, more advantageous, and at a better diſtance, to which the eye is led down a green ſlope, through a ſcenery of tall oaks, in a moſt agreeable manner, the grove we have juſt paſſed on one ſide, and a hill of trees and thicket on the other, conducting the eye to a narrow opening through which it appears.</p>
            <p>We now aſcend to a ſmall bench, where the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent country begins to open; in particular a glaſs-houſe appears between two large clumps of trees, at about the diſtance of four miles; the glaſs-houſes in this country not ill reſembling a diſtant pyramid.
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:0183800601:31"/>
Aſcending to the next ſeat, which is in the Gothic form, the ſcene grows more and more extended; woods and lawns, hills and vallies, thicket and plain, agreeably intermingled. On the back of this ſeat is the following inſcription, which the Author told me that he choſe to fix here, to ſupply what he thought ſome want of life in this part of the farm, and to keep up the ſpectator's attention till he came to ſcale the hill beyond.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And now, paſſing through a wicket, the path winds up the back part of a circular green hill, diſcovering little of the country till you enter a clump of ſtately firs upon the ſummit. Over-arched by theſe firs is an octagonal ſeat, the back of which is ſo contrived as to form a table or pedeſtal for a bowl or goblet, thus inſcribed—
<q>" To all friends round The Wrekin!"</q>
This facetious inſcription, being an old Shropſhire health, is a commemoration of his country friends,
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:0183800601:33"/>
from which this part of Shropſhire is divided: add to this that The Wrekin, that large and venerable hill, appears full in front, at the diſtance of about thirty miles.</p>
            <p>The ſcene is a very fine one, divided by the firs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral compartments, each anſwering to the octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal ſeat in the centre; to each of which is allotted a competent number of ſtriking objects to make a complete picture. A long ſerpentine ſtream waſhes the foot of this hill, and is loſt behind trees at one end, and a bridge thrown over at the other. Over this the eye is carried from very romantic home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenes to very beautiful ones at a diſtance. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to give an idea of that immenſe variety, that fine configuration of parts, which engage our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this place. In one of the compartments you have a ſimple ſcene of a cottage, and a road winding behind a farm-houſe half covered with trees, upon the top of ſome wild ſloping ground; and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other a view of the town, appearing from hence as upon the ſhelving banks of a large piece of water in the flat. Suffice it to ſay, that the hill and vale, plain and woodland, villages and ſingle houſes, blue diſtant mountains that ſkirt the horizon, and green hills ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantically jumbled, that form the intermediate ground, make this ſpot more than commonly ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king—nor is there to be ſeen an acre of level ground through the large extent to which the eye is carried.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:0183800601:34"/>
Hence the path winds on betwixt two ſmall benches, each of which exhibits a pleaſing landſcape, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape the eye of a connoiſſeur.</p>
            <p>Here we wind through a ſmall thicket, and ſoon enter a cavity in the hill, filled with trees, in the centre of which is a ſeat, from whence is diſcovered, gleaming acroſs the trees, a conſiderable length of the ſerpentine ſtream before mentioned, running un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſlight ruſtic bridge to the right: hence we aſcend in a kind of Gothic alcove, looking down a ſlope, ſided with large oaks and tall beeches, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over-arch the ſcene. On the back of this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is found the following</p>

            <p>Below this alcove is a large ſloping lawn, finely bounded, croſſed by the ſerpentine water before mentioned,
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:0183800601:35"/>
and interſperſed with ſingle, or clumps of oaks at agreeable diſtances. Further on the ſcene is finely varied, the hills riſing and falling towards the oppoſite concavities, by the ſide of a long winding vale, with the moſt graceful confuſion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ſcenes that form this landſcape, a fine hanging wood, backed and contraſted with a wild heath, interſected with croſs roads, is a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable object. Near adjoining to this is a ſeat, from whence the water is ſeen to advantage in many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtages of its progreſs; or where (as a poetical friend once obſerved) the proprietor has taken the Naiad by the hand, and led her an irregular dance into the valley.</p>
            <p>Proceeding hence through a wicket, we enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another lawn, beyond which is a new theatre of wild ſhaggy precipices, hanging coppice ground, and ſmooth round hills between, being not only differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but even of an oppoſite character, to the ground from which we paſſed. Walking along the head of this lawn, we come to a ſeat under a ſpreading beech, with this</p>

In the centre of the hanging lawn before you is diſcovered the houſe, half hid with trees and buſhes: a little hanging wood, and a piece of winding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, iſſues through a noble clump of large oaks and ſpreading beeches. At the diſtance of about ten or twelve miles Lord Stamford's grounds appear, and beyond theſe the Clee hills in Shropſhire. The ſcene here conſiſts of admirably-varied ground, and is, I think, a very fine one. Hence paſſing ſtill along the top of the lawn, we croſs another gate, and behind the fence being to deſcend into the valley. About half way down is a ſmall bench, which throws the eye upon a near ſcene of hanging woods and ſhaggy wild declivities, intermixed with ſmooth green ſlopes and ſcenes of cultivation.</p>
            <p>We now return again into the great lawn at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and ſoon come to a ſeat, which gives a nearer view of the water before mentioned, between the trunks of high overſhadowing oaks and beeches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which the winding line of trees is continued down the valley to the right. To the left, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the top of Clent hill appears, and the houſe upon a ſwell, amidſt trees and buſhes. In the centre, the eye is carried by a ſideling view down a length of <pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:0183800601:37"/>
lawn, till it reſts upon the town and ſpire of Hales, with ſome pictureſque and beautiful ground riſing behind it.</p>
            <p>Somewhat out of the path, and in the centre of a noble clump of ſtately beeches, is a ſeat inſcribed to Mr. Spence, in theſe words:<q>IOSEPHO SPENCE, <lb/>eximio noſtro Critoni; <lb/>cvi dicari vellet <lb/>Mvſarvm omnivm et Gratiarvm chorvs, <lb/>dicat amicitia. <lb/>1758<note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>We now, through a ſmall gate, enter what is called The Lover's Walk, and proceed immediately to a ſeat where the water is ſeen very advantageouſly at full length; which, though not large, is ſo agreeably ſhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and has its bounds ſo well concealed, that the beholder may receive leſs pleaſure from many lakes of greater extent. The margin on one ſide is fringed with alders, the other is overhung with moſt ſtately oaks and beeches, and the middle beyond the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſents the Hales Owen ſcene, with a group of houſes on the ſlope behind, and the horizon well
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:0183800601:38"/>
fringed with the wood. Now winding a few paces round the margin of the water, we come to another ſmall bench, which preſents the former ſcene ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what varied, with the addition of a whited village a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong trees upon a hill. Proceeding on, we enter the pleaſing gloom of this agreeable walk, and come to a bench beneath a ſpreading beech that overhangs both walk and water, which has been called The Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Seat, and has this inſcription on the back of it:<q>

               </q> Here the path begins gradually to aſcend beneath a depth of ſhade, by the ſide of which is a ſmall bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling rill, either forming little peninſulas, rolling over pebbles, or falling down ſmall caſcades, all under cover, and taught to murmur very agreeably. This very ſoft and penſive ſcene, very properly ſtyled The Lover's Walk, is terminated with an ornamented urn, inſcribed to Miſs Dolman, a beautiful and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able relation of Mr. Shenſtone's, who died of the ſmall-pox, about twenty-one years of age, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words on one ſide:<q>

            <p>The aſcent from hence winds ſomewhat more ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to another ſeat, where the eye is thrown over a rough ſcene of broken and furzy ground, upon a piece of water in the flat, whoſe extremities are hid behind trees and ſhrubs, amongſt which the houſe appears, and makes upon the whole no unpleaſing picture. The path ſtill winds under cover up the hill, the ſteep declivity of which is ſomewhat eaſed by the ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſweep of it, till we come to a ſmall bench, with this line from Pope's Eloiſa:<q>

               </q> The opening before it preſents a ſolitary ſcene of trees, thickets, and precipice, and terminates upon a green hill, with a clump of firs on the top of it.</p>
            <p>We now find the great uſe as well as beauty of the ſerpentine path in climbing up this wood, the firſt ſeat of which, alluding to the rural ſcene before it, has the following lines from Virgil:<q>
                  <l>— " Hic latis otia fundis</l>

                     </note>."</l>
               </q> Here the eye looking down a ſlope beneath the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arms of oak and beech trees, paſſes firſt over ſome rough furzy ground, then over water to the large ſwelling lawn, in the centre of which the houſe is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered among trees and thickets: this forms the fore ground. Beyond this appears a ſwell of waſte furzy land, diverſified with a cottage, and a road that winds behind a farm-houſe and a fine clump of trees. The back ſcene of all is a ſemicircular range of hills, diverſified with woods, ſcenes of cultivation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, to about four or five miles' diſtance.</p>
            <p>Still winding up into the wood, we come to a ſlight ſeat, opening through the trees to a bridge of five
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:0183800601:41"/>
piers, croſſing a large piece of water at about half a mile's diſtance. The next ſeat looks down from a conſiderable height, along the ſide of a ſteep preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, upon irregular and pleaſing ground. And now we turn upon a ſudden into a long ſtraight-lined walk in the wood, arched over with tall trees, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating with a ſmall ruſtic building. Though the walk, as I ſaid, be ſtraight-lined, yet the baſe riſes and falls ſo agreeably, as leaves no room to cenſure its forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. About the middle of this avenue, which runs the whole length of this hanging wood, we arrive unexpectedly at a lofty Gothic ſeat, whence we look down a ſlope, more conſiderable than that before mentioned, through the wood on each ſide. This view is indeed a fine one, the eye firſt travelling down over well-variegated ground into the valley, where is a large piece of water, whoſe ſloping banks give all the appearance of a noble river. The ground from hence riſes gradually to the top of Clent hill, at three or four miles' diſtance, and the landſcape is enriched with a view of Hales Owen, the late Lord Dudley's houſe, and a large wood of Lord Lyttleton's. It is impoſſible to give an adequate deſcription of this view, the beauty of it depending upon the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of objects and beautiful ſhape of ground, and all at ſuch a diſtance as to admit of being ſeen diſtinctly.</p>
            <p>Hence we proceed to the ruſtic building before mentioned, a ſlight and unexpenſive edifice, formed
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:0183800601:42"/>
of rough unhewn ſtone, commonly called here The Temple of Pan, having a trophy of the Tibia and Syrinx, and this inſcription over the entrance:

               </q>
Hence mounting once more to the right, through this dark umbrageous walk, we enter at once upon a lightſome high natural terrace, whence the eye is thrown over all the ſcenes we have ſeen before, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many fine additional ones, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from a declivity that approaches as near a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice as is agreeable. In the middle is a ſeat with this inſcription:

To give a better idea of this, by far the moſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent ſcene here, it were, perhaps, beſt to divide it into two diſtinct parts—the noble concave in the front, and the rich valley towards the right.—In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the former, if a boon companion could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his idea of a punch-bowl, ornamented within with all the romantic ſcenery the Chineſe ever yet deviſed, it would, perhaps, afford him the higheſt idea he could poſſibly conceive of earthly happineſs:
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:0183800601:43"/>
he would certainly wiſh to ſwim in it. Suffice it to ſay, that the horizon, or brim, is as finely varied as the cavity. It would be idle here to mention the Clee hills, the Wrekin, the Welſh mountains, or Caer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoc, at a prodigious diſtance; which, though they finiſh the ſcene agreeably, ſhould not be mentioned at the Leaſowes, the beauty of which turns chiefly upon diſtinguiſhable ſcenes. The valley upon the right is equally enriched, and the oppoſite ſide thereof well fringed with woods, and the high hills on one ſide this long winding vale rolling agreeably into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows on the other. But theſe are a kind of objects which, though really noble in the ſurvey, will not ſtrike a reader in deſcription as they would a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor upon the ſpot.</p>
            <p>Hence returning back into the wood, and croſſing Pan's Temple, we go directly down the ſlope into another part of Mr. Shenſtone's grounds, the path leading down through very pleaſing home-ſcenes of well-ſhaped ground, exhibiting a moſt perfect concave and convex, till we come at a ſeat under a noble beech, preſenting a rich variety of fore-ground, and at, perhaps, half a mile's diſtance, the Gothic alcove on a hill well covered with wood, a pretty cottage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trees in the more diſtant part of the concave, and a farm-houſe upon the right, all pictureſque objects.</p>
            <p>The next and the ſubſequent ſeat afford pretty much the ſame ſcenes a little enlarged, with the addition
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:0183800601:44"/>
of that remarkable clump of trees called Frankly Beeches, adjoining to the old family-ſeat of the Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tletons, and from whence the preſent Lord Lyttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton derives his title.</p>
            <p>We come now to a handſome Gothic ſcreen, backed with a clump of firs, which throws the eye in front full upon a caſcade in the valley, iſſuing from beneath a dark ſhade of poplars. The houſe appears in the centre of a large ſwelling lawn, buſhed with trees and thicket. The pleaſing variety of eaſy ſwells and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, bounded by ſcenes leſs ſmooth and cultivated, affords the moſt delightful picture of domeſtic retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tranquillity.</p>
            <p>We now deſcend to a ſeat incloſed with handſome pales, and backed with firs, inſcribed to Lord Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton. It preſents a beautiful view up a valley con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted gradually, and ending in a group of moſt magnificent oaks and beeches. The right-hand ſide is enlivened with two ſtriking caſcades, and a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtream ſeen at intervals between tufts of trees and woodland. To the left appears the hanging wood already mentioned, with the Gothic ſcreen on the ſlope in the centre.</p>
            <p>Winding ſtill downwards, we come to a ſmall ſeat, where one of the offices of the houſe, and a view of a cottage on very high ground, is ſeen over the tops of the trees of the grove in the adjacent valley, giving an agreeable inſtance of the abrupt inequality of
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:0183800601:45"/>
ground in this romantic well-variegated country. The next ſeat ſhews another face of the ſame valley, the water gliding calmly along betwixt two ſeeming groves without any caſcade, as a contraſt to the former one, where it was broken by caſcades: the ſcene very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly alluded to by the motto,

            <p>We deſcend now to a beautiful gloomy ſcene, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Virgil's Grove, where, on the entrance, we paſs by a ſmall obeliſk on the right hand, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription:

Before this is a ſlight bench, where ſome of the ſame objects are ſeen again, but in a different point of light. It is not very eaſy either to paint or deſcribe this delightful grove: however, as the former has been more than once attempted, I will hope to apologize for an imperfect deſcription, by the difficulty found
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:0183800601:46"/>
by thoſe who have aimed to ſketch it with their pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Be it, therefore, firſt obſerved, that the whole ſcene is opaque and gloomy, conſiſting of a ſmall deep valley or dingle, the ſides of which are incloſed with irregular tufts of hazel and other underwood, and the whole overſhadowed with lofty trees riſing out of the bottom of the dingle, through which a copious ſtream makes its way through moſſy banks, enamelled with primroſes, and variety of wild wood flowers.

This ſeat is placed upon a ſteep bank on the edge of the valley, from which the eye is here drawn down
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:0183800601:47"/>
into the flat below, by the light that glimmers in front, and by the ſound of various caſcades, by which the winding ſtream is agreeably broken. Oppoſite to this ſeat the ground riſes again in an eaſy concave to a kind of dripping fountain, where a ſmall rill trickles down a rude nich of rock-work, through fern, liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, and acquatic weeds, the green area in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, through which the ſtream winds, being as well ſhaped as can be imagined. After falling down theſe caſcades, it winds under a bridge of one arch, and then empties itſelf into a ſmall lake which catches it a little below. This terminates the ſcene upon the right; and after theſe objects have for ſome time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed the ſpectator, his eye rambles to the left, where one of the moſt beautiful caſcades imaginable is ſeen, by way of incident, through a kind of viſta or glade, falling down a precipice overarched with trees, and ſtrikes us with ſurpriſe. It is impoſſible to expreſs the pleaſure which one feels on this occaſion; for though ſurpriſe alone is not excellence, it may ſerve to quicken the effect of what is beautiful. I believe none ever beheld this grove without a thorough ſenſe of ſatisfaction; and were one to chuſe any particular ſpot of this perfectly Arcadian farm, it ſhould, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be this; although it ſo well contraſts both with the terrace and with ſome other ſcenes, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wiſh them ever to be divided. We now proceed to a ſeat at the bottom of a large root on the ſide of a ſlope, with this inſcription:</p>

            <p>The view from it is a calm tranquil ſcene of water, gliding through ſloping ground, with a ſketch through the trees of the ſmall pond below.</p>
            <p>The ſcene in this place is that of water ſtealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long through a rude ſequeſtered vale, the ground on each ſide covered with weeds and field flowers, as that before is kept cloſe ſhaven. Farther on we loſe all ſight of water, and only hear the noiſe, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the appearance; a kind of effect which the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe are fond of producing in what they call their Scenes of enchantment. We now turn, all on a ſudden, upon the high caſcade which we admired before in
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:0183800601:49"/>
viſta. The ſcene around is quite a grotto of native ſtone running up it, roots of trees overhanging it, and the whole ſhaded over head. However, we firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, upon the left, a chalybeat ſpring, with an iron bowl chained to it, and this inſcription upon a ſtone:

which I have often heard Mr. Shenſtone term the definition of a grotto. We now wind up a ſhady path on the left hand, and croſſing the head of this caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, paſs beſide the river that ſupplies it in our way up to the houſe.

From this laſt is an opening down the valley over a large ſliding lawn, well edged with oaks, to a piece of water croſſed by a conſiderable bridge in the flat—the ſteeple of Hales, a village amid trees, making on the whole a very pleaſing picture. Thus winding through flowering ſhrubs, beſide a menageric for doves, we are conducted to the ſtables. But let it not be forgot, that on the entrance into this ſhrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery the firſt object that ſtrikes us is a Venus de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis, beſide a baſon of gold-fiſh, encompaſſed round with ſhrubs, and illuſtrated with the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription;<q>
