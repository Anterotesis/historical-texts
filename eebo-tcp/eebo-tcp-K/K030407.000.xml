            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ſucceſs of a Dramatic piece on the Stage, depends, ſays Voltaire, upon accidental circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but the day of publication decides its fate.</p>
            <p>Perſuaded of the truth of this remark, the Author of the Tragedy of Alfred would have ſubmitted his performance, to the final judgment of the Reader, without preface or apology, if he had not been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, and indeed urged, to make a reply to ſome hoſtile criticiſms, which appear to have been founded upon prejudice and opinion, rather than reaſon and argument.</p>
            <p>It has been alledged, that the character of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, in the Tragedy, does not agree with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Alfred in Hiſtory: "That the Hero, the Legiſlator, is degraded to a Lover, who enters the Daniſh camp, from a private, not a public, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and acts the part of an impoſtor."</p>
            <p>In Tragedy, if the ſubject be Hiſtorical, an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is not permitted to introduce events, contrary
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0154301100:3"/>
to the great eſtabliſhed facts of Hiſtory; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the Tragedy of Alfred, the Hero muſt not be killed, nor driven out of England by the Danes; but preſerving thoſe ancient foundations, as the piers of his bridge, the Author may bend his arches, and finiſh the fabrick, according to his taſte and fancy, for the poet is at liberty, and it is the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his art, to invent ſuch intermediate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and incidents, as he thinks will produce the moſt affecting ſituations. In this department, the Poet's fancy is controuled by nothing, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability and conſiſtence of character, the barriers of dramatic truth. Let us apply this principle to the point in diſpute.</p>
            <p>Alfred was a young man, when he fought the battle of Ethendune. The victory, which gave him poſſeſſion of the kingdom, muſt have been gained before he begun to model the ſtate, Is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable to ſuppoſe, that a young hero was in love? Is it inconſiſtent to repreſent the perſon, who was a Legiſlator when advanced in years, as a lover in his youth! Does it degrade the character of a hero to ſuppoſe, that he was in love with the princeſs whom he afterwards married? Is it not rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to his heroiſm to conclude, that he choſe a conſort whom he did not love? If this reaſoning is juſt, there will be no difficulty in vindicating the ſubſequent conduct of the hero. The dramatic and the real Alfred, are both involved in the charge of impoſture; both entered the Daniſh camp in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; the previous events, as narrated in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, are nearly the ſame with thoſe mentioned in hiſtory. Alfred, for almoſt two years, had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered thro' England, concealing himſelf under feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed names and characters. He lived in the midſt of his enemies, by being ſuppoſed to be dead. Emerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this obſcurity, he appears in the tragedy, and is informed of the alarming ambiguous ſituation of Ethelſwida; his uſual ſtratagems preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, one would think, naturally to his mind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0154301100:4"/>
agitated, and prone both by temper and habit, to the moſt daring and romantic enterprizes. He reſolves to enter the Daniſh camp, to learn the fate of Ethelſwida, and obſerve the ſtrength and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the enemy's army, before he ventures a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive engagement.</p>
            <p>The continued artifice is inevitable. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Alfred, in the camp of Hinguar; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he deceives the Dane, is extremely ſimilar to the conduct of Oreſtes in the Electra of Sophocles, which no critic hitherto has blamed. Oreſtes enters the palace of Aegiſthus, as the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of his own death, carrying an urn, which contains (he ſays) the aſhes of Oreſtes, whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fate he moſt circumſtantially relates. The Grecian hero practiſes the deceit with an intention to kill the perſons whom he deceives. The Engliſh hero deceives Hinguar only to gain acceſs to Ethelſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wida, without meaning to hurt the perſon of his enemy. To praiſe Sophocles, and blame the author of Alfred, for the ſame conduct, ſeems a direct contradiction, which can only be accounted for, in one way; an imaginary idea has been formed of the character of Alfred as an old mortified, aſcetic ſage, of ſpirit too ſublime and aetherial to deſcend to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man paſſions or human actions. But the real as well as the dramatic Alfred was a young hero, a bard, a winner of battles, brave and magnanimous, but compelled by the preſſure of thoſe deſperate times, in which he lived, to practiſe a thouſand arts to exiſt by ſimulation and diſſimulation. Whoever recollects and weighs theſe circumſtances, will it is preſumed readily pardon the artifice of Alfred, in the Tragedy, and acknowledge that the <hi>feigned</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of the piece are altogether conſiſtent with the true. If not, the author muſt be contented to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under the imputation of an erroneous judgment, for he meant nothing leſs than to degrade the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Alfred; on the contrary, finding in the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0154301100:5"/>
records of a remote and barbarous age, a hero of great renown, but from the defect of his hiſtorians, involved in clouds and darkneſs:
<q>Qui caput inter nubila condit.</q>
he was tempted to ſeize his name, and diſplay his character in new ſituations, connected with the old and well known events of his life and fortune. The play is printed as it was performed. An alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation has been made, in one ſcene, and ſent to the Theatre, which, if the Tragedy ſhould be reſumed or revived, may perhaps contribute to heighten its effect.</p>
