            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y expectations in this ſmall perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
may ſeem ſomewhat extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
when I declare that my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are to render a larger work
more intelligible to ordinary capacities,
by abridging it. 'Tis however certain, that thoſe
who are not accuſtomed to abſtract reaſoning, are apt
to loſe the thread of argument, where it is drawn
out to a great length, and each part fortified with all
the arguments, guarded againſt all the objections,
and illuſtrated with all the views, which occur to
a writer in the diligent ſurvey of his ſubject. Such
Readers will more readily apprehend a chain of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
that is more ſingle and conciſe, where the
chief propoſitions only are linkt on to each other, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated
by ſome ſimple examples, and confirmed by a
few of the more forcible arguments. The parts ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nearer together can better be compared, and the
connexion be more eaſily traced from the firſt principles
to the laſt concluſion.</p>
            <p>THE work, of which I here preſent the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with an abſtract, has been complained of as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
and difficult to be comprehended, and I am apt
to think, that this proceeded as much from the length
as from the abſtractedneſs of the argument. If I
have remedy'd this inconvenience in any degree, I
have attain'd my end. The book ſeem'd to me to have
ſuch an air of ſingularity, and novelty as claim'd the
<pb facs="tcp:0148001400:3"/>
attention of the public; eſpecially if it be found, as
the Author ſeems to inſinuate, that were his philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
receiv'd, we muſt alter from the foundation the
greateſt part of the ſciences. Such bold attempts are
always advantageous in the republic of letters, becauſe
they ſhake off the yoke of authority, accuſtom men to
think for themſelves, give new hints, which men of
genius may carry further, and by the very oppoſition,
illuſtrate points, wherein no one before ſuſpected any
difficulty.</p>
            <p>THE Author muſt be contented to wait with
patience for ſome time before the learned world can
agree in their ſentiments of his performance. 'Tis his
misfortune, that he cannot make an <hi>appeal to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
who in all matters of common reaſon and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
are found ſo infallible a tribunal. He muſt be
judg'd by the FEW, whoſe verdict is more apt to be
corrupted by partiality and prejudice, eſpecially as no
one is a proper judge in theſe ſubjects, who has not
often thought of them; and <hi>ſuch</hi> are apt to form to
themſelves ſyſtems of their own, which they reſolve
not to relinquiſh. I hope the Author will excuſe me
for intermeddling in this affair, ſince my aim is only
to encreaſe his auditory, by removing ſome difficulties,
which have kept many from apprehending his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>I have choſen one ſimple argument, which I have
carefully traced from the beginning to the end. This
is the only point I have taken care to finiſh. The reſt
is only hints of particular paſſages, which ſeem'd to
me curious and remarkable.</p>

ABSTRACT
OF
A BOOK lately PUBLISHED,
ENTITULED,
<hi>A Treatiſe of Human Nature,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS book ſeems to be wrote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſame plan with ſeveral
other works that have had a
great vogue of late years in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The philoſophical ſpirit, which has
been ſo much improved all over <hi>Europe</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
theſe laſt fourſcore years, has been carried
to as great a length in this kingdom as in any
other. Our writers ſeem even to have ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a new kind of philoſophy, which promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
more both to the entertainment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of mankind, than any other with
which the world has been yet acquainted.
Moſt of the philoſophers of antiquity, who
treated of human nature, have ſhewn more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0148001400:5"/>
of a delicacy of ſentiment, a juſt ſenſe of
morals, or a greatneſs of ſoul, than a depth of
reaſoning and reflection. They content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with repreſenting the common ſenſe of
mankind in the ſtrongeſt lights, and with the
beſt turn of thought and expreſſion, without
following out ſteadily a chain of propoſitions, or
forming the ſeveral truths into a regular ſcience.
But 'tis at leaſt worth while to try if the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>man</hi> will not admit of the ſame accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
which ſeveral parts of natural philoſophy
are found ſuſceptible of. There ſeems to be all
the reaſon in the world to imagine that it may
be carried to the greateſt degree of exactneſs.
If, in examining ſeveral phaenomena, we find
that they reſolve themſelves into one common
principle, and can trace this principle into
another, we ſhall at laſt arrive at thoſe few
ſimple principles, on which all the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
And tho' we can never arrive at the
ultimate principles, 'tis a ſatisfaction to go as
far as our faculties will allow us.</p>
            <p>THIS ſeems to have been the aim of our
late philoſophers, and, among the reſt, of
this author. He propoſes to anatomize hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature in a regular manner, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to draw no concluſions but where he is
authorized by experience. He talks with
contempt of hypotheſes; and inſinuates, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0148001400:6"/>
ſuch of our countrymen as have baniſhed
them from moral philoſophy, have done a
more ſignal ſervice to the world, than <hi>my
Lord Bacon,</hi> whom he conſiders as the father
of experimental phyſicks. He mentions, on
this occaſion, <hi>Mr. Locke, my Lord Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
Dr. Mandeville, Mr. Hutchiſon, Dr.
Butler,</hi> who, tho' they differ in many points
among themſelves, ſeem all to agree in found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their accurate diſquiſitions of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
intirely upon experience.</p>
            <p>BESIDE the ſatisfaction of being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with what moſt nearly concerns us, it
may be ſafely affirmed, that almoſt all the
ſciences are comprehended in the ſcience of
human nature, and are dependent on it. <hi>The
ſole end of</hi> logic <hi>is to explain the principles and
Operations of our reaſoning faculty, and the
nature of our ideas;</hi> morals and criticiſm <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
our taſtes and ſentiments; and</hi> politics
<hi>conſider men as united in ſociety, and dependent
on each other.</hi> This treatiſe therefore of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature ſeems intended for a ſyſtem of the
ſciences. The author has finiſhed what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
logic, and has laid the foundation of the
other parts in his account of the paſſions.</p>
            <p>THE celebrated <hi>Monſieur Leibnitz</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it to be a defect in the common ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems
of logic, that they are very copious
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0148001400:7"/>
when they explain the operations of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in the forming of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but are too conciſe when they treat of
probabilities, and thoſe other meaſures of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on which life and action intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
and which are our guides even in moſt
of our philoſophical ſpeculations. In this
cenſure, he comprehends <hi>the eſſay on human
underſtanding, le recherche de la verité,</hi> and
<hi>l'art de penſer.</hi> The author of the <hi>treatiſe of
human nature</hi> ſeems to have been ſenſible of
this defect in theſe philoſophers, and has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured,
as much as he can, to ſupply it.
As his book contains a great number of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
very new and remarkable, it will be
impoſſible to give the reader a juſt notion of
the whole. We ſhall therefore chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
ourſelves to his explication of our reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
from cauſe and effect. If we can make
this intelligible to the reader, it may ſerve as
a ſpecimen of the whole.</p>
            <p>OUR author begins with ſome definitions.
He calls a <hi>perception</hi> whatever can be preſent
to the mind, whether we employ our ſenſes,
or are actuated with paſſion, or exerciſe our
thought and reflection. He divides our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
into two kinds, <hi>viz. impreſſions</hi> and
<hi>ideas.</hi> When we feel a paſſion or emotion
of any kind, or have the images of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0148001400:8"/>
objects conveyed by our ſenſes; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the mind is what he calls an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi>
which is a word that he employs in
a new ſenſe. When we reflect on a paſſion
or an object which is not preſent, this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is an <hi>idea. Impreſſions,</hi> therefore, are
our lively and ſtrong perceptions; <hi>ideas</hi> are
the fainter and weaker. This diſtinction is
evident; as evident as that betwixt feeling
and thinking.</p>
            <p>THE firſt propoſition he advances, is, that
all our ideas, or weak perceptions, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from our impreſſions, or ſtrong percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that we can never think of any
thing which we have not ſeen without us,
or felt in our own minds. This propoſition
ſeems to be equivalent to that which Mr.
<hi>Locke</hi> has taken ſuch pains to eſtabliſh, <hi>viz.
that no ideas are innate.</hi> Only it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
as an inaccuracy of that famous phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
that he comprehends all our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
under the term of idea, in which
ſenſe it is falſe, that we have no innate ideas.
For it is evident our ſtronger perceptions or
impreſſions are innate, and that natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
love of virtue, reſentment, and all
the other paſſions, ariſe immediately from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I am perſwaded, whoever would take
the queſtion in this light, would be eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0148001400:9"/>
to reconcile all parties. <hi>Father Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche</hi>
would find himſelf at a loſs to point
out any thought of the mind, which did not
repreſent ſomething antecedently felt by it,
either internally, or by means of the external
ſenſes, and muſt allow, that however we
may compound, and mix, and augment, and
diminiſh our ideas, they are all derived from
theſe ſources. <hi>Mr. Locke,</hi> on the other
hand, would readily acknowledge, that all
our paſſions are a kind of natural inſtincts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from nothing but the original conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the human mind.</p>
            <p>OUR author thinks, <q rend="inline">"that no diſcovery
could have been made more happily for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
all controverſies concerning ideas than
this, that impreſſions always take the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency
of them, and that every idea with
which the imagination is furniſhed, firſt
makes its appearance in a correſpondent
impreſſion. Theſe latter perceptions are
all ſo clear and evident, that they admit
of no controverſy; tho' many of our ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
are ſo obſcure, that 'tis almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
even for the mind, which forms them,
to tell exactly their nature and compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</q>
Accordingly, wherever any idea
is ambiguous, he has always recourſe to
the impreſſion, which muſt render it clear
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0148001400:10"/>
and preciſe. And when he ſuſpects that any
philoſophical term has no idea annexed to it
(as is too common) he always aſks <hi>from what
impreſſion that idea is derived?</hi> And if no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
can be produced, he concludes that
the term is altogether inſignificant. 'Tis after
this manner he examines our idea of <hi>ſubſtance</hi>
and <hi>eſſence;</hi> and it were to be wiſhed, that
this rigorous method were more practiſed in
all philoſophical debates.</p>
            <p>'TIS evident, that all reaſonings concerning
<hi>matter of fact</hi> are founded on the relation of
cauſe and effect, and that we can never infer
the exiſtence of one object from another,
unleſs they be connected together, either
mediately or immediately. In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to underſtand theſe reaſonings, we muſt
be perfectly acquainted with the idea of a
cauſe; and in order to that, muſt look about
us to find ſomething that is the cauſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>HERE is a billiard-ball lying on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and another ball moving towards it with
rapidity. They ſtrike; and the ball, which
was formerly at reſt, now acquires a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This is as perfect an inſtance of the
relation of cauſe and effect as any which we
know, either by ſenſation or reflection. Let
us therefore examine it. 'Tis evident, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0148001400:11"/>
the two balls touched one another before
the motion was communicated, and that
there was no interval betwixt the ſhock and
the motion. <hi>Contiguity</hi> in time and place is
therefore a requiſite circumſtance to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all cauſes. 'Tis evident likewiſe,
that the motion, which was the cauſe, is
prior to the motion, which was the effect.
<hi>Priority</hi> in time, is therefore another requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
circumſtance in every cauſe. But this is
not all. Let us try any other balls of the
ſame kind in a like ſituation, and we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
find, that the impulſe of the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
motion in the other. Here therefore
is a <hi>third</hi> circumſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> that of a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
conjunction</hi> betwixt the cauſe and effect.
Every object like the cauſe, produces always
ſome object like the effect. Beyond theſe
three circumſtances of contiguity, priority,
and conſtant conjunction, I can diſcover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this cauſe. The firſt ball is in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
touches the ſecond; immediately the
ſecond is in motion: and when I try the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
with the ſame or like balls, in the
ſame or like circumſtances, I find, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the motion and touch of the one ball,
motion always follows in the other. In what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhape I turn this matter, and however I
examine it, I can find nothing farther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0148001400:12"/>
THIS is the caſe when both the cauſe and
effect are preſent to the ſenſes. Let us now
ſee upon what our inference is founded, when
we conclude from the one that the other has
exiſted or will exiſt. Suppoſe I ſee a ball
moving in a ſtreight line towards another, I
immediately conclude, that they will ſhock,
and that the ſecond will be in motion. This
is the inference from cauſe to effect; and of
this nature are all our reaſonings in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of life: on his is founded all our belief
in hiſtory: and from hence is derived all phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
excepting only geometry and arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic.
If we can explain the inference from
the ſhock of two balls, we ſhall be able to
account for this operation of the mind in all
inſtances.</p>
            <p>WERE a man, ſuch as <hi>Adam,</hi> created in the
full vigour of underſtanding, without expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
he would never be able to infer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the ſecond ball from the motion and
impulſe of the firſt. It is not any thing that
reaſon ſees in the cauſe, which make us <hi>infer</hi>
the effect. Such an inference, were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
would amount to a demonſtration, as
being founded merely on the compariſon of
ideas. But no inference from cauſe to effect
amounts to a demonſtration. Of which there
is this evident proof. The mind can always
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0148001400:13"/>
               <hi>conceive</hi> any effect to follow from any cauſe,
and indeed any event to follow upon another:
whatever we <hi>conceive</hi> is poſſible, at leaſt in a
metaphyſical ſenſe: but wherever a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
takes place, the contrary is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and implies a contradiction. There is
no demonſtration, therefore, for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of cauſe and effect. And this is a
principle, which is generally allowed by phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</p>
            <p>IT would have been neceſſary, therefore,
for <hi>Adam</hi> (if he was not inſpired) to have
had <hi>experience</hi> of the effect, which followed
upon the impulſe of theſe two balls. He
muſt have ſeen, in ſeveral inſtances, that
when the one ball ſtruck upon the other, the
ſecond always acquired motion. If he had
ſeen a ſufficient number of inſtances of this
kind, whenever he ſaw the one ball moving
towards the other, he would always conclude
without heſitation, that the ſecond would
acquire motion. His underſtanding would
anticipate his ſight, and form a concluſion
ſuitable to his paſt experience.</p>
            <p>IT follows, then, that all reaſonings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
cauſe and effect, are founded on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and that all reaſonings from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
are founded on the ſuppoſition, that
the courſe of nature will continue uniformly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0148001400:14"/>
the ſame. We conclude, that like cauſes,
in like circumſtances, will always produce
like effects. It may now be worth while to
conſider, what determines us to form a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of ſuch infinite conſequence.</p>
            <p>'TIS evident, that <hi>Adam</hi> with all his ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
would never have been able to <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi>
that the courſe of nature muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
uniformly the ſame, and that the future
muſt be conformable to the paſt. What is
poſſible can never be demonſtrated to be falſe;
and 'tis poſſible the courſe of nature may
change, ſince we can conceive ſuch a change.
Nay, I will go farther, and aſſert, that he
could not ſo much as prove by any <hi>probable</hi>
arguments, that the future muſt be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the paſt. All probable arguments are
built on the ſuppoſition, that there is this
conformity betwixt the future and the paſt,
and therefore can never prove it. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
is a <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and if it muſt
be proved, will admit of no proof but from
experience. But our experience in the paſt
can be a proof of nothing for the future, but
upon a ſuppoſition, that there is a reſemblance
betwixt them. This therefore is a point,
which can admit of no proof at all, and which
we take for granted without any proof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0148001400:15"/>
WE are determined by CUSTOM alone to
ſuppoſe the future conformable to the paſt.
When I ſee a billiard-ball moving towards
another, my mind is immediately carry'd by
habit to the uſual effect, and anticipates my
ſight by conceiving the ſecond ball in motion.
There is nothing in theſe objects, abſtractly
conſidered, and independent of experience,
which leads me to form any ſuch concluſion:
and even after I have had experience of many
repeated effects of this kind, there is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which determines me to ſuppoſe, that
the effect will be conformable to paſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
The powers, by which bodies ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
are entirely unknown. We perceive
only their ſenſible qualities: and what <hi>reaſon</hi>
have we to think, that the ſame powers will
always be conjoined with the ſame ſenſible
qualities?</p>
            <p>'TIS not, therefore, reaſon, which is the
guide of life, but cuſtom. That alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
the mind, in all inſtances, to ſuppoſe
the future conformable to the paſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
eaſy this ſtep may ſeem, reaſon would
never, to all eternity, be able to make it.</p>
            <p>THIS is a very curious diſcovery, but leads
us to others, that are ſtill more curious. <hi>When
I ſee a billiard ball moving towards another, my
mind is immediately carried by habit to the uſual</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0148001400:16"/>
               <hi>and anticipate my ſight by conceiving the ſecond
ball in motion.</hi> But is this all? Do I nothing
but CONCEIVE the motion of the ſecond ball?
No ſurely. I alſo BELIEVE that it will move.
What then is this <hi>belief?</hi> And how does it
differ from the ſimple conception of any
thing? Here is a new queſtion unthought of
by philoſophers.</p>
            <p>When a demonſtration convinces me of
any propoſition, it not only makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the propoſition, but alſo makes me
ſenſible, that 'tis impoſſible to conceive any
thing contrary. What is demonſtratively falſe
implies a contradiction; and what implies a
contradiction cannot be conceived. But with
regard to any matter of fact, however ſtrong
the proof may be from experience, I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
conceive the contrary, tho' I cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
believe it. The belief, therefore, makes
ſome difference betwixt the conception to
which we aſſent, and that to which we do
not aſſent.</p>
            <p>To account for this, there are only two
hypotheſes. It may be ſaid, that belief joins
ſome new idea to thoſe which we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
without aſſenting to them. But this
hypotheſis is falſe. For <hi>firſt,</hi> no ſuch idea can
be produced. When we ſimply conceive an
object, we conceive it in all its parts. We
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0148001400:17"/>
conceive it as it might exiſt, tho' we do not
believe it to exiſt. Our belief of it would
diſcover no new qualities. We may paint out
the entire object in imagination without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it. We may ſet it, in a manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, with every circumſtance of
time and place. 'Tis the very object conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as it might exiſt; and when we believe
it, we can do no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE mind has a faculty of join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all ideas together, which involve not a
contradiction; and therefore if belief conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſome idea, which we add to the ſimple
conception, it would be in a man's power,
by adding this idea to it, to believe any thing,
which he can conceive.</p>
            <p>SINCE therefore belief implies a concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet is ſomething more; and ſince
it adds no new idea to the conception; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that it is a different MANNER of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
an object; <hi>ſomething</hi> that is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the feeling, and depends not upon our
will, as all our ideas do. My mind runs by
habit from the viſible object of one ball mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards another, to the uſual effect of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the ſecond ball. It not only conceives
that motion, but <hi>feels</hi> ſomething different in
the conception of it from a mere reverie of the
imagination. The preſence of this viſible
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0148001400:18"/>
object, and the conſtant conjunction of that
particular effect, render the idea different to
the <hi>feeling</hi> from thoſe looſe ideas, which come
into the mind without any introduction.
This concluſion ſeems a little ſurprizing;
but we are led into it by a chain of propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which admit of no doubt. To eaſe
the reader's memory I ſhall briefly reſume
them. No matter of fact can be proved but
from its cauſe or its effect. Nothing can be
known to be the cauſe of another but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
We can give no reaſon for extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the future our experience in the paſt;
but are entirely determined by cuſtom, when
we conceive an effect to follow from its uſual
cauſe. But we alſo believe an effect to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
as well as conceive it. This belief joins
no new idea to the conception. It only
varies the manner of conceiving, and makes
a difference to the feeling or ſentiment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
therefore, in all matters of fact ariſes
only from cuſtom, and is an idea conceived
in a peculiar <hi>manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR author proceeds to explain the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or feeling, which renders belief different
from a looſe conception. He ſeems ſenſible,
that 'tis impoſſible by words to deſcribe this
feeling, which every one muſt be conſcious
of in his own breaſt. He calls it ſometimes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0148001400:19"/>
a <hi>ſtronger</hi> conception, ſometimes a more <hi>lively,</hi>
a more <hi>vivid,</hi> a <hi>firmer,</hi> or a more <hi>intenſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
And indeed, whatever name we
may give to this feeling, which conſtitutes
belief, our author thinks it evident, that it
has a more forcible effect on the mind than
fiction and mere conception. This he proves
by its influence on the paſſions and on the
imagination; which are only moved by truth
or what is taken for ſuch. Poetry, with all
its art, can never cauſe a paſſion, like one in
real life. It fails in the original conception
of its objects, which never <hi>feel</hi> in the ſame
manner as thoſe which command our belief
and opinion.</p>
            <p>OUR author preſuming, that he had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proved, that the ideas we aſſent to are
different to the feeling from the other ideas,
and that this feeling is more firm and lively
than our common conception, endeavours in
the next place to explain the cauſe of this
lively feeling by an analogy with other acts of
the mind. His reaſoning ſeems to be curious;
but could ſcarce be rendered intelligible, or at
leaſt probable to the reader, without a long
detail, which would exceed the compaſs I
have preſcribed to myſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0148001400:20"/>
I have likewiſe omitted many arguments,
which he adduces to prove that belief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
merely in a peculiar feeling or ſentiment.
I ſhall only mention one; our paſt experience
is not always uniform. Sometimes one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
follows from a cauſe, ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
In which caſe we always believe, that
that will exiſt which is moſt common. I
ſee a billiard-ball moving towards another.
I cannot diſtinguiſh whether it moves upon
its axis, or was ſtruck ſo as to skim along the
table. In the firſt caſe, I know it will not
ſtop after the ſhock. In the ſecond it may
ſtop. The firſt is moſt common, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I lay my account with that effect. But
I alſo conceive the other effect, and conceive
it as poſſible, and as connected with the
cauſe. Were not the one conception diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the feeling or ſentiment from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there would be no difference betwixt
them.</p>
            <p>WE have confin'd ourſelves in this whole
reaſoning to the relation of cauſe and effect,
as diſcovered in the motions and operations of
matter. But the ſame reaſoning extends to
the operations of the mind. Whether we
conſider the influence of the will in moving
our body, or in governing our thought, it
may ſafely be affirmed, that we could never
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0148001400:21"/>
foretel the effect, merely from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the cauſe, without experience. And
even after we have experience of theſe effects,
'tis cuſtom alone, not reaſon, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
us to make it the ſtandard of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
judgments. When the cauſe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
the mind, from habit, immediately
paſſes to the conception and belief of the uſual
effect. This belief is ſomething different
from the conception. It does not, however,
join any new idea to it. It only makes it be
felt differently, and renders it ſtronger and
more lively.</p>
            <p>HAVING diſpatcht this material point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the nature of the inference from
cauſe and effect, our author returns upon
his footſteps, and examines anew the idea of
that relation. In the conſidering of motion
communicated from one ball to another, we
could find nothing but contiguity, priority in
the cauſe, and conſtant conjunction. But,
beſide theſe circumſtances, 'tis commonly
ſuppos'd, that there is a neceſſary connexion
betwixt the cauſe and effect, and that the
cauſe poſſeſſes ſomething, which we call a
<hi>power,</hi> or <hi>force,</hi> or <hi>energy.</hi> The queſtion is,
what idea is annex'd to theſe terms? If all
our ideas or thoughts be derived from our
impreſſions, this power muſt either diſcover
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0148001400:22"/>
itſelf to our ſenſes, or to our internal feeling.
But ſo little does any <hi>power</hi> diſcover itſelf to
the ſenſes in the operations of matter, that
the <hi>Carteſians</hi> have made no ſcruple to aſſert,
that matter is utterly deprived of energy, and
that all its operations are perform'd merely
by the energy of the ſupreme Being. But the
queſtion ſtill recurs, <hi>What idea have we of
energy or power even in the ſupreme Being?</hi>
All our idea of a Deity (according to thoſe
who deny innate ideas) is nothing but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of thoſe ideas, which we acquire from
reflecting on the operations of our own minds.
Now our own minds afford us no more notion
of energy than matter does. When we conſider
our will or volition a <hi>priori,</hi> abſtracting from
experience, we ſhould never be able to infer
any effect from it. And when we take the
aſſiſtance of experience, it only ſhows us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
contiguous, ſucceſſive, and conſtantly
conjoined. Upon the whole, then, either
we have no idea at all of force and energy,
and theſe words are altogether inſignificant,
or they can mean nothing but that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the thought, acquir'd by habit, to
paſs from the cauſe to its uſual effect. But
who-ever would thoroughly underſtand this
muſt conſult the author himſelf. 'Tis ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
if I can make the learned world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0148001400:23"/>
that there is ſome difficulty in the
caſe, and that who-ever ſolves the difficulty
muſt ſay ſome thing very new and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
as new as the difficulty itſelf.</p>
            <p>BY all that has been ſaid the reader
will eaſily perceive, that the philoſophy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in this book is very ſceptical, and tends
to give us a notion of the imperfections and
narrow limits of human underſtanding. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all reaſoning is there reduced to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and the belief, which attends experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is explained to be nothing but a peculiar
ſentiment, or lively conception produced by
habit. Nor is this all, when we believe any
thing of <hi>external</hi> exiſtence, or ſuppoſe an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to exiſt a moment after it is no longer
perceived, this belief is nothing but a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ſame kind. Our author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
upon ſeveral other ſceptical topics; and
upon the whole concludes, that we aſſent to
our faculties, and employ our reaſon only
becauſe we cannot help it. Philoſophy wou'd
render us entirely <hi>Pyrrhonian,</hi> were not nature
too ſtrong for it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude the logics of this author
with an account of two opinions, which ſeem
to be peculiar to himſelf, as indeed are moſt
of his opinions. He aſſerts, that the ſoul,
as far as we can conceive it, is nothing but a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0148001400:24"/>
ſyſtem or train of different perceptions, thoſe
of heat and cold, love and anger, thoughts
and ſenſations; all united together, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any perfect ſimplicity or identity. <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> maintained that thought was the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the mind; not this thought or that
thought, but thought in general. This ſeems to
be abſolutely unintelligible, ſince every thing,
that exiſts, is particular: And therefore it
muſt be our ſeveral particular perceptions,
that compoſe the mind. I ſay, <hi>compoſe</hi> the
mind, not <hi>belong</hi> to it. The mind is not a
ſubſtance, in which the perceptions inhere.
That notion is as unintelligible as the <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi>
that thought or perception in general is
the eſſence of the mind. We have no idea
of ſubſtance of any kind, ſince we have no
idea but what is derived from ſome impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and we have no impreſſion of any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
either material or ſpiritual. We know
nothing but particular qualities and percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
As our idea of any body, a peach, for
inſtance, is only that of a particular taſte, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
figure, ſize, conſiſtence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So our
idea of any mind is only that of particular
perceptions, without the notion of any thing
we call ſubſtance, either ſimple or compound.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond principle, which I propoſed
to take notice of, is with regard to Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0148001400:25"/>
Having denied the infinite diviſibility of
extenſion, our author finds himſelf obliged to
refute thoſe mathematical arguments, which
have been adduced for it; and theſe indeed
are the only ones of any weight. This he
does by denying Geometry to be a ſcience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
enough to admit of concluſions ſo ſubtile
as thoſe which regard infinite diviſibility.
His arguments may be thus explained. All
Geometry is founded on the notions of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and inequality, and therefore according
as we have or have not an exact ſtandard of
that relation, the ſcience itſelf will or will
not admit of great exactneſs. Now there is
an exact ſtandard of equality, if we ſuppoſe
that quantity is compoſed of indiviſible points.
Two lines are equal when the numbers of
the points, that compoſe them, are equal,
and when there is a point in one correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a point in the other. But tho' this
ſtandard be exact, 'tis uſeleſs; ſince we can
never compute the number of points in any
line. It is beſides founded on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of finite diviſibility, and therefore can
never afford any concluſion againſt it. If we
reject this ſtandard of equality, we have
none that has any pretenſions to exactneſs. I
find two that are commonly made uſe of.
Two lines above a yard, for inſtance, are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0148001400:26"/>
ſaid to be equal, when they contain any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
quantity, as an inch, an equal number
of times. But this runs in a circle. For
the quantity we call an inch in the one is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be <hi>equal</hi> to what we call an inch in
the other: And the queſtion ſtill is, by what
ſtandard we proceed when we judge
them to be equal; or, in other words, what
we mean when we ſay they are equal. If
we take ſtill inferior quantities, we go on <hi>in
infinitum.</hi> This therefore is no ſtandard of
equality. The greateſt part of philoſophers,
when ask'd what they mean by equality,
ſay, that the word admits of no definition,
and that it is ſufficient to place before us two
equal bodies, ſuch as two diameters of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
to make us underſtand that term. Now
this is taking the <hi>general appearance</hi> of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
for the ſtandard of that proportion, and
renders our imagination and ſenſes the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
judges of it. But ſuch a ſtandard ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of no exactneſs, and can never afford
any concluſion contrary to the imagination
and ſenſes. Whether this queſtion be juſt or
not, muſt be left to the learned world to
judge. 'Twere certainly to be wiſh'd, that
ſome expedient were fallen upon to reconcile
philoſophy and common ſenſe, which with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the queſtion of infinite diviſibility
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0148001400:27"/>
have wag'd moſt cruel wars with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>WE muſt now proceed to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the ſecond volume of this work,
which treats of the PASSIONS. 'Tis of more
eaſy comprehenſion than the firſt; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
opinions, that are altogether as new and
extraordinary. The author begins with <hi>Pride</hi>
and <hi>humility.</hi> He obſerves, that the objects
which excite theſe paſſions, are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and ſeemingly very different from each
other. Pride or ſelf-eſteem may ariſe from
the qualities of the mind; wit, good-ſenſe,
learning, courage, integrity: from thoſe of
the body; beauty, ſtrength, agility, good
mein, addreſs in dancing, riding, fencing:
from external advantages; country, family,
children, relations, riches, houſes, gardens,
horſes, dogs, cloaths. He afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to find out that common circumſtance,
in which all theſe objects agree, and which
cauſes them to operate on the paſſions. His
theory likewiſe extends to love and hatred,
and other affections. As theſe queſtions, tho'
curious, could not be rendered intelligible
without a long diſcourſe, we ſhall here omit
them.</p>
            <p>IT may perhaps be more acceptable to
the reader to be informed of what our author
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0148001400:28"/>
ſays concerning <hi>free-will.</hi> He has laid the
foundation of his doctrine in what he ſaid
concerning cauſe and effect, as above explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<q rend="inline">" 'Tis univerſally acknowledged, that
the operations of external bodies are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
and that in the communication of
their motion, in their attraction and mutual
coheſion, there are not the leaſt traces of
indifference or liberty."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Whatever
therefore is in this reſpect on the ſame
footing with matter, muſt be acknowledged
to be neceſſary. That we may know
whether this be the caſe with the actions of
the mind, we may examine matter, and
conſider on what the idea of a neceſſity
in its operations are founded, and why we
conclude one body or action to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
cauſe of another."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It has been obſerved already, that in no
ſingle inſtance the ultimate connexion of
any object is diſcoverable either by our
ſenſes or reaſon, and that we can never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
ſo far into the eſſence and conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of bodies, as to perceive the principle
on which their mutual influence is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
'Tis their conſtant union alone, with
which we are acquainted; and 'tis from
the conſtant union the neceſſity ariſes, when
the mind is determined to paſs from one
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0148001400:29"/>
object to its uſual attendant, and infer the
exiſtence of one from that of the other.
Here then are two particulars, which we
are to regard as eſſential to <hi>neceſſity, viz.</hi>
the conſtant <hi>union</hi> and the <hi>inference</hi> of the
mind, and wherever we diſcover theſe we
muſt acknowledge a neceſſity."</q> Now
nothing is more evident than the conſtant
union of particular actions with particular
motives. If all actions be not conſtantly
united with their proper motives, this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is no more than what may be obſerved
every day in the actions of matter, where by
reaſon of the mixture and uncertainty of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the effect is often variable and uncertain.
Thirty grains of opium will kill any man that
is not accuſtomed to it; tho' thirty grains of
rhubarb will not always purge him. In like
manner the fear of death will always make
a man go twenty paces out of his road; tho'
it will not always make him do a bad action.</p>
            <p>AND as there is often a conſtant conjunction
of the actions of the will with their motives,
ſo the inference from the one to the other is
often as certain as any reaſoning concerning
bodies: and there is always an inference pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the conſtancy of the conjunction.
On this is founded our belief in witneſſes, our
credit in hiſtory, and indeed all kinds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0148001400:30"/>
evidence, and almoſt the whole conduct of
life.</p>
            <p>OUR author pretends, that this reaſoning
puts the whole controverſy in a new light, by
giving a new definition of neceſſity. And,
indeed, the moſt zealous advocates for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
muſt allow this union and inference with
regard to human actions. They will only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that this makes the whole of neceſſity.
But then they muſt ſhew, that we have an
idea of ſomething elſe in the actions of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which, according to the foregoing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>THRO' this whole book, there are great
pretenſions to new diſcoveries in philoſophy;
but if any thing can intitle the author to ſo
glorious a name as that of an <hi>inventor,</hi> 'tis
the uſe he makes of the principle of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation
of ideas, which enters into moſt of
his philoſophy. Our imagination has a great
authority over our ideas; and there are no ideas
that are different from each other, which it
cannot ſeparate, and join, and compoſe into
all the varieties of fiction. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the empire of the imagination, there
is a ſecret tie or union among particular ideas,
which cauſes the mind to conjoin them more
frequently together, and makes the one, upon
its appearance, introduce the other. Hence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0148001400:31"/>
ariſes what we call the <hi>apropos</hi> of diſcourſe:
hence the connection of writing: and hence
that thread, or chain of thought, which a
man naturally ſupports even in the looſeſt
<hi>reverie.</hi> Theſe principles of aſſociation are
reduced to three, <hi>viz. Reſemblance;</hi> a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
naturally makes us think of the man it
was drawn for. <hi>Contiguity;</hi> when <hi>St. Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
is mentioned, the idea of <hi>Paris</hi> naturally
occurs. <hi>Cauſation;</hi> when we think of the
ſon, we are apt to carry our attention to the
father. 'Twill be eaſy to conceive of what
vaſt conſequence theſe principles muſt be in
the ſcience of human nature, if we conſider,
that ſo far as regards the mind, theſe are the
only links that bind the parts of the univerſe
together, or connect us with any perſon or
object exterior to ourſelves. For as it is by
means of thought only that any thing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
upon our paſſions, and as theſe are the
only ties of our thoughts, they are really <hi>to
us</hi> the cement of the univerſe, and all the
operations of the mind muſt, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
depend on them.</p>
