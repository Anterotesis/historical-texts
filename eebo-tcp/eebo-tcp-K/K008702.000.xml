            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TREATISE ON THE TEETH.</head>
            <p>THE Teeth,<note place="margin">Formation,</note> which are the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſmootheſt Bones of the Body, are formed within the Cavities of the Jaws. Above the Gums they are not covered by any Membrane, but within their Sockets are inveſted with the common covering of all other Bones; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> a fine tranſparent Skin, obſervable in ſcraping any Bone, after the Meat is taken clean off.</p>
            <p>The Number of Teeth in a grown Perſon are generally thirty-ſix; more or leſs according to Age, Conſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As they are not all formed at once, ſo neither do they all appear at the ſame time; the laſt but one, of the great Teeth in each Jaw, 'tis remarkable, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom appears 'till about the Age of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0148800900:3"/>and the laſt, ſometimes not till that of forty.</p>
            <p>Each Tooth is compoſed of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal bony Subſtance, and an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vitrious <hi>Cortex,</hi> of a ſolid hard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and of the Colour of Ivory. The Uſes of this gloſſy Subſtance are to prevent the Teeth being worn by the Friction they undergo in Maſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Chewing; and to preſerve their bony Subſtance from the Air.</p>
            <p>The different Shape and Series of the Teeth are ſufficiently obvious; the four front Teeth in each Jaw which are thin and broad, are called <hi>Inciſſores</hi> or Cutters, from their cutting or dividing the Aliment. The <hi>Canini</hi> or Dog-teeth, which are two in each Jaw, are ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Reſemblance to the Tuſks of a Dog; thoſe of the upper Jaw are by ſome, called the Eye-teeth, from the Communication of Nerves betwixt them and the Eyes; they are thick and round, terminating in a ſharp Point, and like the <hi>Inciſſores</hi> have but one Root, but are remarkably ſtrong, and of a greater Length than any of the reſt: Their proper Uſe being to pierce and hold the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0148800900:4"/>Aliment ſteady when we bite it, as the front Teeth are very apt to be forced outwards by the Things we hold or break with them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>large</hi> or <hi>double</hi> Teeth, are by Anatomiſts called <hi>Molares</hi> or Grinders, from their Uſe in grinding and making ſmall our Aliment before it is ſwallowed. They are ten in each Jaw; their Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are broad and uneven, and becauſe the Preſſure upon them is perpendicular, they are provided with two or three, and ſometimes four Roots ſeparated a little from one another, and inclining ſomewhat outwards, that in chewing our Aliment the Preſſure may be leſs upon the Jaws, than if they run directly down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and with only a ſingle Root.</p>
            <p>The firſt Teeth, according to <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> are engendered in Time of Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy; this <hi>Urbain Hemard</hi> confeſſes he never could diſcover; he ſays, indeed, that having opened the Jaws of ſome Children three or four Days old, and others immediately at their Birth, he has found the <hi>Inciſſores,</hi> the <hi>Canini,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Molares</hi> on each Side the Jaw in part oſſified, and in part muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0148800900:5"/>of a middling Size, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with their little Alveoli.</p>
            <p>However this may be, it is certain they do not appear, until ſome Time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Formation of the other Bones, notwithſtanding the Matter of which they are formed, is at the ſame Time in the Womb; and therefore <hi>Galen</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>De Uſu Partium,</hi> Lib. ii. Chap. 3.</note> writes, that he who would underſtand the Works of Nature, and obſerve her Oeconomy in the Compoſition of the human Body, ought not implicitly to rely on what he finds in Books, but rather what he ſees with his Eyes.</p>
            <p>The Teeth are formed within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the Jaws, which are lined with a thin Membrane, ſupplied with ſeveral Veſſels, conveying a thick, viſcous, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Liquor, which as it increaſes, hardens into the Form of Teeth.</p>
            <p>This tranſparent Humour appears firſt in Form of a Mucus, afterwards a thin cortical <hi>Lamella,</hi> and ſome oſſious <hi>Strata</hi> are perceived, with a large Cavity in the Middle, then gradually both the vitrious and bony Parts increaſe by the hardening of the Mucus, and Oppoſition of new Matter.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0148800900:6"/>
            <p>The oſſious <hi>Strata</hi> are no other than a Separation of this fluid Matter, made by the ſame Membrane which covers the whole Cavity of the Jaw; and this Diviſion forms two Lays, one below the other, the uppermoſt of which forms the Teeth which come out firſt; but about the ſeventh Year, <hi>they</hi> are thruſt out by the Teeth made at the undermoſt Lay, which then begin to ſprout; if theſe latter be loſt, they ſeldom if ever grow again; ſome are indeed obſerved to ſhed their Teeth twice, which muſt be owing to their having three Lays of this Matter.</p>
            <p>The Teeth receive Nerves and Veſſels at the Orifices of their Roots; it is theſe Nerves which are afflicted in the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and which are frequently ſhewn to the common People, by the ignorant among Tooth-drawers, for Worms; which they pretend would have eaten the whole Tooth in a ſhort time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Part of theſe Nerves being always torn away with the Tooth drawn, it requires great Care to keep the Mouth warm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Gum becomes cloſed, and the Nerve defended from the Air.</p>
            <p>This Orifice commonly cloſes about
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0148800900:7"/>the Age of thirty-five, which is the Reaſon why old People are not ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Tooth-ach as young.</p>
            <p>The firſt Teeth perceived, are the <hi>Inciſſores</hi> of the upper Jaw, then thoſe of the lower, theſe being the thinneſt and ſharpeſt. After them appear the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini,</hi> and laſt of all the <hi>Molares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The general Opinion is, that the Teeth are connected to thin <hi>Alveoli,</hi> or Sockets, by that kind of Suture called <hi>Gomphoſis,</hi> that is, like a Nail drove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Piece of Wood; but this is proved to be falſe by the following Experiment. If the Jaws be macerated in Water, for ſome Time, all the Teeth will drop out, which they would not do, if they were of the ſame Size of their <hi>Alveoli.</hi> From hence it appears, that it is by a <hi>Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or by the Articulation called <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondroſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Teeth are joined to their Sockets by ſome means like this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for when a Tooth hath been drawn and replaced immediately, it hath taken root, and been as firm as ever, which could not have happened, had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0148800900:8"/>not the Cavity been lined with a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, which contained it.</p>
            <p>After all that can be ſaid concerning the Formation of the Teeth, nothing will ſo much illuſtrate the Tooth in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio, as that called the Sweet-Tooth in a Calf, by which the Reader may form an Idea, not only of the Colour and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Mucus, or Juice uſually ſuck'd out, but of the <hi>Lamella</hi> or Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Uſe of the Teeth.</note>The Teeth are ſo neceſſary to Man, that I conceive the greateſt Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of his ſubſiſting in the younger part of his Life without them: Certain it is, that the ſtrongeſt Conſtitution, would not be able to digeſt or ſeparate a Quantity of Chyle ſufficient for the Nouriſhment of the Body for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Time, were the Aliment to be ſwallowed whole and unprepared; for it is well known how much the chewing our Aliment contributes to the eaſy and expeditious Digeſtion of it, and conſequently to our Health. There are indeed many old People and others, who for want of Teeth are confined to a liquid Diet, ſuch as Broths, Jellies,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0148800900:9"/>Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Sake of an eaſy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. To thoſe in old Age, I think ſuch a Diet not only proper, but very neceſſary; for Nature, by the Decay of Strength, the Loſs of Teeth, and the gradual Diminution of our Senſes, ſeems to have appointed this Time, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our primary Innocence; that we may make our Exit in ſome Meaſure conformable with our Birth: And at this Time the Weakneſs of the Body generally renders it incapable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the natural Functions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of digeſting ſuch Meats, as before it had been accuſtomed to.</p>
            <p>Upon a tranſient Reflection we might imagine it injudicious of Nature to leave Age thus helpleſs and unable to ſupport itſelf, but upon a more careful Survey, we ſhall find in this, as well as in all her Works, that her Oeconomy is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely juſt, and that every minute Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is important: Whenever we think otherwiſe, we ought always to ſuſpect our Capacities of being too groſs to comprehend the Sublimity of her Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The Loſs of Teeth to an old Man, is in Fact but trifling, for the Human Body is ſo providentially diſpoſed, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0148800900:10"/>as the natural Powers begin to leſſen i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their Force and Action, the leſs is required in the Conſtitution to maintain that Force and Action; and that a leſs Quantity of Chyle will better nouriſh and ſupport Health in old Age, is a Truth every Anatomiſt is able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, for it is frequently ſeen in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections of the older Subjects, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſmall Veſſels, and ſometimes Part of the larger alſo have been collapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and grown up, ſo as to reject the Fluid that uſed to circulate through them: And this is one Reaſon why old People are moſt ſubject to paralytic Diſorders.</p>
            <p>If the Number of Veſſels be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in this Caſe they certainly are, then is there the leſs required to fill them, and the Body is more eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported than before, and from hence it is, that we can ſo well diſpenſe with the Loſs of Teeth when old: But when this Loſs happens earlier in Life, I think it may juſtly be deemed very great, ſince it is capable of depriving us of our Health, our Beauty, our Voice: Nor does the Inconveniency ſtop here, it proves of Detriment even to Society.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0148800900:11"/>
            <p>If ſuch extenſive Effects appear ſtrange, let the Huſbandman, ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Society, be viewed in this State, and we ſhall ſoon be convinced, that the Want of Teeth is of greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than is commonly imagined: It would oblige him to live on a liquid Diet, by no means proper in <hi>his</hi> labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Employ; for we are not the leaſt capable to ſupport the continual Action of the Body (and which in his Buſineſs is almoſt violent) without proper Food; I mean ſuch as will remain ſome Time in the Stomach and yield its Nouriſhment gradually to the lacteal Veſſels, which receive and carry it to the Blood.</p>
            <p>This is always performed by <hi>ſuch</hi> Food either animal or vegetable. And if the Diet of the Labourer conſiſted only of thoſe Juices excluſive of the Subſtances, tho' theſe latter afford no Part of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, yet the Body would waſte, the Fibres would become lax, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines would loſe their Tone, and a general Languor would ſeize the whole Body; and if not relieved by a Change of Diet, a <hi>Diarrhea,</hi> Dropſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be the certain Introduction to Death.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0148800900:12"/>
            <p>The Conſequence of a liquid Diet is no where more obvious, than in the old <hi>ſedentary Man,</hi> in whom, by an inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Life, the <hi>Viſcera</hi> are rendered weak, and the Vigour of the digeſting Powers in a great Meaſure loſt for want of Uſe. He is indeed better able to ſupport Life than the working Man, as he is void of the Fatigue; but with what great Difficulty it is effected, may be ſeen in his pale lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid Countenance, his emaciated Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Defect of Vigour in his Motion.</p>
            <p>I cannot help reflecting in this Place on the general Error of Men fond of Study, whoſe contemplative Geniuſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining them to a Life, in other Reſpects full of Indolence and Neglect, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it agreeable to their Way of Life, to eat their Aliment liquid, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for an expeditious Paſſage in the <hi>Primae Viae;</hi> in this Method they ſeem to imitate Birds and other Animals, which, in the room of Teeth, Nature has ſupplied with two Stomachs. Where in the firſt the Corn is only ſwelled and ſoftened by the Liquor of its Glands, but broken and diſolved in the ſecond; which is compoſed of very ſtrong Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0148800900:13"/>This Oeconomy is wonderful in the Animal, but by no means applicable to the rational Creature. Although the Pot and other Implements uſed in Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, where the Aliment receives ſome Degrees of Digeſtion, may bear ſome Analogy to the firſt Stomach in the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, yet the <hi>Operation</hi> is different, it is by the <hi>Succus Gaſtricus,</hi> a Liquor ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Glands of the Stomach, that the Corn is made ſoft and fitted, to the Action of the ſecond Stomach, where it is received together with the Juices of the firſt. But in boiling, the moſt nutrimental Parts are loſt, the more volatile and ſpiritous evaporate, while the groſs fatty Parts are blended with the Water.</p>
            <p>Therefore whoever takes down the Subſtance loads the Stomach to very little Purpoſe, and whoever drinks the Broth will relax his Stomach, and rob it of the Vigour required to perform its Office. But nothing will ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the Impropriety of ſuch a Regimen, as a Knowledge of Digeſtion, and the Manner of its being performed; which for the Sake of ſuch Readers as are unacquainted with theſe Subjects
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0148800900:14"/>we will take a curſory View of in its firſt Stages.</p>
            <p>The principal Agents employed in this Action, are the Teeth, the Saliva, the <hi>Succus Gaſtricus,</hi> and the Liquors we drink. The Aliment being broke by the Teeth, and mixed with the Saliva in the Mouth, deſcends into the Stomach, where it imbibes the Juices of the Glands, and the Liquors drank, whoſe chief Property is to ſoften the Aliments, as they are Fluids which eaſily enter the Pores of moiſt Bodies, and, ſwelling them, break their moſt intimate Coheſions; and this is augmented by the <hi>Impetus</hi> which the Heat of the Stomach gives to the Particles of the Fluids; and likewiſe by rarefying the Air contained in the Pores of our Food, which burſts its Parts aſunder.</p>
            <p>The Aliments thus prepared, their Parts ſoon ſeparate from one another, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into a Fluid with the Liquor of the Stomach, by the continual Motion of its Sides, whoſe abſolute Power is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated (by <hi>Pitcairn</hi>) to be equal to the Preſſure of 117088 Pound-weight: To which if we add the abſolute Force of the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> and Muſcles of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> which likewiſe conduce to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0148800900:15"/>the Sum will amount to 250734 Pound-weight.</p>
            <p>From whence this Force? Or for what Purpoſe hath Nature (who yet hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been detected in an Error) employed all this Mechaniſm, if uſeleſs? There can be no Occaſion to ſpare it the Trouble of its Office, and the only Excuſe Men find for ſo doing, is becauſe 'tis already weakened by ſome Cauſe, and incapable of acting. But to ſuch I would obſerve, that 'tis not by theſe Means to be brought to its natural Tone. And the ſtudious Man, whoſe Life is generally inactive, will find it more to his Advantage, and agreeable to the Conſtitution of his Nerves, on whoſe Senſation he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends for his Ideas, to live more upon Food containing the natural Juices, of which Kind eſpecially are all roaſted Meats.</p>
            <p>I could not conveniently treat on this Subject without mentioning Digeſtion, ſince the Teeth are the firſt and neceſſary Organs of it. Wherever we obſerve theſe Inſtruments wanting in Animals, &amp;c. we ſhall always find them furniſhed with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0148800900:16"/>two Stomachs; and where they have Teeth beſides, they are only uſed as Weapons of Defence, which we ſee in the Viper, and ſome Kinds of Fiſh, who ſwallow their Prey whole.</p>
            <p>From hence we may conclude, that the Teeth, beſides their Importance for the Preſervation of our Health, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary for the Agreement of the Voice, the Pronunciation and Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Words, and the Ornament of the Face.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Teeth.</note>Tho' the Production of the Teeth is entirely the Work of Nature, the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them depends greatly upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Men are naturally attentive to their Health, but by a Neglect of this Kind they are too often rendered incapable of attaining it: For, as I have before ſhewn, the Health depending on the Digeſtion of the Aliments, which ought firſt to be pounded as it were, and broke for the eaſier Admiſſion of the Juices of the Stomach: And this being the Office of the Teeth, it intimately concerns us
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0148800900:17"/>to keep them in ſuch Order as will enable them to perform it.</p>
            <p>The Means to preſerve them, conſiſts then principally in the Choice of a good Regimen, and avoiding the Uſe of ſuch Things as are hurtful to their external Parts.</p>
            <p>The firſt you ſee will not only preſerve the Teeth, but at the ſame Time the Health alſo, as it conſiſts in the Choice of ſuch Aliment as will yield a good Nouriſhment. But the Generality of People are ſo prone to Intemperance, and eat with ſo little Attention, or rather ſo precipitately, that too much cannot be ſaid of its ill Effects. Nothing is capable of producing greater Diſorders, than an imperfect Maſtication; for if the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not well broken by the Teeth, 'tis certain the Diſſolution in the Stomach will be long, laborious, and imperfect. And the ſweet balſamic Blood, will be changed into a thick, acrid, and viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous State. And this Alteration cannot fail of producing a bad Effect in the Teeth, not only as it circulates thro' them, but by the Vapours which ariſe from the Stomach and Breath, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0148800900:18"/>lodge upon them as they paſs thro' the Mouth.</p>
            <p>The too great Uſe of Vegetables, as alſo the Fleſh of Pork, ſalted Meats, Salt-fiſh, Cheeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial, as they all produce a bad Chyle.</p>
            <p>All Kinds of Sweet-meats and Sugars contribute very much to the Deſtruction of the Teeth; becauſe their gluey Juice is inſinuated into the Gums, and ſticks to the Teeth; beſides, Sugars are of an acid, penetrant, and corroſive Nature, and by a <hi>Chymical Analyſis</hi> we ſee that the Effects will be ſooner or later per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. 'Tis alſo remarkable that thoſe People who make great Uſe of this Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are more ſubject to the Tooth-ach, and loſe their Teeth ſooner than others.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who love Sugar, and uſe it frequently, are ſeldom remarkable for handſome Teeth, and very rarely good ones. This is particularly exemplified in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof, eſpecially the Women, are great Tea-drinkers, and in their Manner ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what particular, for inſtead of ſweetning each Diſh with Loaf-Sugar as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0148800900:19"/>they hold a Piece of Sugar-Candy in their Mouths, which frequently ſerves ſix or eight Diſhes before 'tis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, which inevitably produces thoſe Effects to which they are ſo ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> the Loſs and Ruin of their Teeth: For 'tis rare to find a <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman of thirty Years of Age with a good Set of Teeth: For this Reaſon, after eating Sugar, or any Thing that contains much Sugar in its Compoſition, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to rince the Mouth with warm Water, to diſſolve and waſh away thoſe Parts which would ſtick to the Gums and Teeth.</p>
            <p>It would be abſurd from hence to conclude it abſolutely neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive ourſelves of theſe Things, but to regulate their Uſe; and not to make a Habit of that which Experience ſhews to be prejudicial moſt certainly is worth our Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Of no leſs Importance is Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in Drinking, ſince our Health is equally dependant on Sobriety; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conſtitutions we ſee ruined by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Kind, is a ſtronger Argument
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0148800900:20"/>to deter us than any Thing that can be further ſaid on this Head.</p>
            <p>'Tis as neceſſary likewiſe to avoid chewing or breaking any hard Bodies, as Nuts, Cherry-ſtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> biting off the Ends of Thread or Silk, lifting up great Weights, picking them with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Gold, Silver, or any other Metal, by which they may be either looſened or loſt, and other ſuch idle and pernicious Practices.</p>
            <p>Exceſſive ſmoaking Tobacco is alſo very injurious (eſpecially if Care be not taken to cover the End of the Pipe with Wax); which will by Degrees wear off their vitrious or gloſſy Subſtance, and ſubject them to the Danger of becoming rotten, and perfectly uſeleſs: It beſides gives them a black and filthy Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and cauſes an unnatural Heat in the Mouth, which by the immediate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of cold Air, may arreſt a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the Gums or neighbouring Glands, and be the Foundation of great Pain and Trouble.</p>
            <p>I would not have the Reader imagine me ignorant of the Qualities of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0148800900:21"/>I am ſufficiently ſenſible of its Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in preſerving the Teeth, by evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the ſuperfluous Humours: But like any other Specific, it may, if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly made uſe of, anſwer a very different Effect. I would therefore by all Means adviſe waſhing the Mouth with warm Water, and not expoſing it too ſoon after ſmoaking to the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a cold Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Effects which have been obſerved to follow ſmoaking, are the very ſame when we eat our Victuals too hot, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, or in a little Time after, eat ſomething cold. Many People drink, in the ſame Inſtant, a Liquor almoſt boiling hot, and ſome other as cold as Ice, without recollecting that the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Heat and Cold is able to arreſt and fix the Humours which nouriſh the Teeth, which ſtagnating, will ferment and break the Membrane that covers the Roots of the Teeth, and render them carious.</p>
            <p>This Effect is produced by the Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Parts and the Rarefaction of the Liquids that paſs thro' the Veſſels, occaſioned by Heat. As Cold on the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0148800900:22"/>contrary will contract and ſhut up the Parts, abate the Motion of Circulation and render the Juices contained in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Veſſels, thick and incapable of paſſing.</p>
            <p>The great Preſervation of our Teeth, in ſhort chiefly depends on our Regimen of Living; the Conſtitution, and the Teeth, have ſo equal a Dependance on each other, that the Deſtruction of the latter proves the Ruin of the former, almoſt as certain, as that a bad Blood can never ſupply the Teeth with good Nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">General Cauſes of the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Teeth.</note>The Cauſes that produce the Diſeaſes of the Teeth, are two in general: The one internal, the other external. The internal Cauſe is owing to the Quantity or Quality of the Lymph, which by its corroſive Parts is capable of deſtroying the moſt compact Parts of the human Body, ſuch as are the Teeth, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the external Subſtance, or gloſſy Covering of the Bones of which they are compoſed.</p>
            <p>The Lymph we find of this Character in the Scurvy, in the King's Evil, and in the Pox.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0148800900:23"/>
            <p>When the nutritious Juice is too abundant, or diſtributed in too great Quantity into the Teeth, that it ſtagnates between their Alveoli and their Roots, its Effects are very dangerous, like as when the Blood is inflamed, it may form phlegmonic Abſceſſes in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Teeth, or in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts: It may alſo occaſion the moſt exquiſite Pains, incurable but by the Loſs of the Tooth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note>Too much Sleep, too much watching, a too ſedentary Life, or a too laborious one, contribute not a little to the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or to the Ruin of the Teeth.</p>
            <p>The good Quality of the Milk which the Child receives from its Nurſe is of great Importance to the Formation of the Teeth, in the Time of too thing; as it ſerves to prevent or diminiſh the many Accidents that happen to Children, when the Teeth are diſpoſed to pierce the Membrane of the Gum, that covers their Extremities and oppoſes their Iſſue.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0148800900:24"/>
            <p>All violent Paſſions are capable of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Digeſtion, of increaſing or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Maſs of Blood, of cauſing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and of ſtopping the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Excretions which mould ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate daily for the Preſervation of our Health. The Paſſions, I ſay, may, when they alter the Maſs of Blood to a certain Degree, be ranged with the internal Cauſes that produce the Diſeaſes of the Teeth.</p>
            <p>All Perſons in a pituitous or pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Habit of Body, in whom the Lymph is very abundant, are generally ſubject to ſuffer not only Pain in the Teeth, but even their Loſs.</p>
            <p>The Generality of Women with Child are likewiſe ſubject to this Complaint: The menſtrual Diſcharge being ſtopped, the Maſs of Blood muſt reſt charged with a Superfluity; 'tis therefore from the Quantity that is depoſited on the Teeth or on the Gums, that Women ſuffer this Uneaſineſs ſooner when with Child than at other Times; and we ſee that they are often afflicted for the ſame
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0148800900:25"/>Reaſon, when their monthly Oeconomy is over.</p>

            <p>The external Cauſes are not leſs in Number, nor are they leſs dangerous in their Effects. The thick Vapours that ariſe from the Stomach and Lungs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Mouth much in the ſame Manner that Soot adheres to the Sides of the Chimney, forming a tenacious viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Subſtance that covers the Teeth like Paſte.

            <p>The Injuries of the Weather are the Cauſes of Rheums and Catarrhes, from which the Teeth, the Alveoli, and the Gums, are too often very great Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0148800900:26"/>
            <p>The too great Uſe of dentrifick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſerves chiefly to Deſtruction, as they uſe or wear off the Part of the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to their Preſervation, viz. their Enamel or vitrious Subſtance.</p>
            <p>But the Neglect in not keeping them clean, is the moſt general Cauſe of all the Diſorders that happen to the Teeth.</p>
            <p>Mercury is a great Enemy to the Teeth, not only by itſelf but by the bad Effects that it may produce in the Body, by the corroſive Qualities that moſt of the Preparations of Mercury are charged with, or by the Alliance that it contracts with different Principles in our Bodies, when it ſtays too long, or when 'tis not properly evacuated.</p>
            <p>'Tis very evident that Mercury, by its ill Effects, ſwells the Gums and renders them ſore; this it does alſo to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes that cover the Roots of the Teeth, either internally or externally; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, if I may be allowed the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the very Roots, and throws them out of their Sockets, or otherwiſe, it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0148800900:27"/>deſtroys them by the Caries that it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Theſe melancholy Effects we ſee but too often, eſpecially where Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath been employed by Perſons little verſed in its Uſe. The moſt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Practitioners in the <hi>Venereal Diſeaſe</hi> uſe it with the utmoſt Circumſpection, and with great Induſtry guard againſt its Poiſon. The Gilders and thoſe who cover Looking-Glaſſes, Plumbers, and ſuch as work in Mines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the bad and fatal Impreſſions that Mercury makes upon them, and particularly upon their Teeth.</p>
            <p>'Tis by the Effects produced from theſe Cauſes, that the Teeth are attended with ſuch Diverſity of Diſeaſes, almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanied with Pain, more or leſs violent.</p>
            <p>Authors have reckoned the Number of Diſeaſes of the Teeth to amount to upwards of an hundred, but I find on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nineteen neceſſary to comprehend all that may be uſeful to know, and theſe may be divided into three Claſſes: In the firſt are thoſe produced by external Cauſes; in the ſecond are contained the Diſorders of the Alveoli and Gums;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0148800900:28"/>and in the third are the Diſeaſes acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental or ſymptomatic.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Of the Tartar or Turf.</note>The firſt Diſeaſe from external Cauſes worth our Notice is, the Tartar or Turf, concerning which Authors ſpeak of many different Sorts, as the yellow, the grey, the black, and the petrified, and diſtinguiſh them alſo by their Degrees of Conſiſtence; but as this laſt is owing only to the Duration, and the Difference of Colour not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, I ſhall ſpeak only of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sort, which is of a dark yellow, tending rather to a brown Colour.</p>
            <p>The Tartar is a Matter accumulated on the Surface of the Teeth, near the Gums, which in Proceſs of Time will form a ſtrong Cruſt, of a conſiderable Bigneſs, common to thoſe who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent in keeping their Teeth clean. This foreign Matter as it increaſes in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, inevitably conſumes the Gums, and by that Means occaſions a Rottenneſs of the Teeth.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Tartar, with the Cauſes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0148800900:29"/>that produce it, and the Manner of its inſenſible Formation, the two following Principles may be of Service.</p>
            <p>Firſt the Foundation of this Matter and its Increaſe may bear ſome Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to the Stones formed in the Kidneys, Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which owe their Origin very often to a Retention of ſome Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, capable of <hi>Attraction</hi> and <hi>Coheſion:</hi> The ſmall Portions of our Aliment that adhere to the upper Part of the Teeth, or betwixt their Interſtices, being ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the Saliva, become of a gluey Conſiſtence, which ſoon grows dry, by the Aſſiſtance of more Air, paſſing in Inſpiration and Expiration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when the Saliva becomes viſcous, from a Deprivation of the Lymph, and is loaded with ſaline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, 'tis very probable that it may be lodged upon the Body of the Teeth, and by Degrees form the Maſs we are ſpeaking off. That this Matter may be ſo cauſed, I am the more ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from the Obſervation<note n="*" place="bottom">Le Journal de Saeavans de lannle, <hi>1721.</hi>
               </note> of a ſtrong
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0148800900:30"/>Concretion being found upon the Roots of the Tongue, formed by a viſcous Lymph, reſembling the Saliva in Thirſt. 'Tis difficult to aſſign any other Cauſe than that the Saliva may become tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous and form this Subſtance.</p>
            <p>The firſt Lay or Bed of Tartar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once formed, 'tis eaſy to conceive it augmented by the Addition of freſh Matter, and to increaſe to an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Size.</p>
            <p>From the Nature of this Diſeaſe we may readily infer, that the Cure, or Means to prevent it, will conſiſt in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Regimen as will preſerve the Purity of the Blood in its natural State; and by being careful to waſh the Mouth often, (which is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prevent a ſtinking Breath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned as well by this Neglect as the Diſorder here mentioned) we may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Uſe and Beauty of our Teeth, for many Years.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jaundice</hi> of the Teeth is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as another Diſeaſe; but I think with Impropriety, it being nothing more than a tarniſhed Subſtance, or Viſcoſity
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0148800900:31"/>ſticking to the Teeth, like Duſt, or the Humidity that covers the Surface of a Looking-glaſs when 'tis not kept clean; and to me it ſeems to be nothing more than a Bed or Lay of Matter, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tartar.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Senſibility and Agace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>The Senſibility and Agacement of the Teeth, are Diſorders produced from external Cauſes.</p>
            <p>The Writers on this Subject have been of oppoſite Opinions, ſome main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Teeth to be inſenſible Bodies, others on the contrary making them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely capable of Senſation. 'Tis true that ſimply as ſo many Bones, we may conſider them as inſenſible; but as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and lined with Membranes, and furniſhed with Veſſels and Nerves, we cannot deny them the Quality of Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any more than other Parts of the Body.</p>
            <p>By the Senſibility of the Teeth is to be underſtood that fixed and permanent Pain, that we generally expreſs by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have the Tooth-ach.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0148800900:32"/>
            <p>By the Agacement of the Teeth is meant that acute Pain we expreſs by ſaying they are ſet on Edge, cauſed by certain Sounds, ſuch as the touching of Stuffs, the ſlipping of a Knife or Fork upon a China-Plate, or the filing a Piece of Iron, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pains of the Teeth are of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds: But the moſt general are thoſe called <hi>pungent</hi> or pricking, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Intervals; the other <hi>diſtenſive</hi> or continual, ſuch as accompany a Caries, in which the Air by drying or criſping the Fibres, Nerves and Coats of the little Veſſels, render them bony, and contract their Diameters too ſmall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Fluid thro' them, by which Means the Efforts of the Humours, to diſtend their Orifices, cauſe that Pain we call diſtenſive.</p>
            <p>If on the contrary the little Veſſels ſhould be ruptured, the Liquor extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated would ſoon change its Nature, and fermenting would irritate the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, and produce the Pain called pungent.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0148800900:33"/>
            <p>The Agacement we find to be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kind of Senſation, owing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general Opinion, to an acid Juice, inſinuated betwixt the Fibres of the Membranes, that covers the Roots of the Teeth; and when the Teeth are compreſſed againſt this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, that Diſpoſition occaſions the Action of the Juices againſt the Fibres of the Membrane.</p>
            <p>I believe that the Juices of certain Fruits, ſuch as Cherries, Gooſeberries, Apples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be inſinuated betwixt the Interſtices of the Fibres that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Membranes, and diſtending them, intercept the Courſe of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in ſome Veſſels, and by ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nerves, produce a Senſation more or leſs troubleſome to bear: But 'tis very different from that ſeated in the Body of the Tooth.</p>
            <p>What makes me conſider that the Agacement is fixed only to the Body or Surface of the Teeth is, if they are wiped with a Piece of warm Linen, it will immediately diminiſh their Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And in Oppoſition to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Acid being the Cauſe, the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0148800900:34"/>following Experiment will ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: If the Herb Sorrel be chewed between the Teeth, the Agacement will ſuddenly ceaſe; if this Diſeaſe be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by an Acid, is it not ſtrange that it ſhould admit of this Remedy? Sorrel which is itſelf an Acid, muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe than abate the Diſorder! 'Tis poſſible that ſome Parts of the Juice may be ſubtle enough to penetrate the Fibres that terminate it: But how Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel acts in remedying this Evil, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I am not able to conceive. We may obſerve that the Air taken in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration when the Mouth is half open, will produce the ſame Effect: And I cannot believe that Air in paſſing, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſo forcibly as to make that Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt the Membranes at the Roots of the Teeth, which they aſſign to be the Cauſe. 'Tis more natural to ſuppoſe that the ſubtle Particles of the Air en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Pores of the Enamel, and the Reſiſtance made to the groſſer Parts, may occaſion a Tremor in the Tooth, and a Senſation not unlike the Agace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Caries or Rottenneſs is a Diſeaſe produced likewise from external Causes.<note place="margin">Rottenness.</note>
            </p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0148800900:35"/>
            <p>The Teeth are more ſubject to this Diſeaſe, than all the other Bones in the Body, both by their Structure and Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>This Diſeaſe is occaſioned by a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour inſinuated between the boney Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the Teeth, which generally meets with Obſtructions in the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Part of the Tooth, and by the particular Impulſe, that every Particle communicates to the Cells of the Tooth, by Degrees, breaks off little Parcels, and in Time, makes that dark Cavity in the Tooth which we call <hi>hollow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Teeth are more ſubject to Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs than the other Bones, becauſe their Perioſteum is more preſſed; which renders them ſubject to Obſtructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Molares</hi> are more ſubject to this Diſeaſe than the <hi>Inciſſores</hi> or <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni;</hi> and the <hi>Inciſſores</hi> and <hi>Canini</hi> of the upper Jaw, more than thoſe of the lower Jaw, becauſe by their Situation they are more expoſed to Heat and Cold, in eating or drinking, in Inſpiration and Expiration.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0148800900:36"/>
            <p>It often happens, that after a Tooth is attack'd with a Caries, the oppoſite Tooth, on the other Side of the ſame Jaw, is affected alſo. Nor does it appear that this Effect depends only upon Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard: For 'tis remarkable, that in the oppoſite Tooth the Caries will not only much reſemble the other, but ſometimes be exactly uniform to it.</p>
            <p>The Vulgar, as well as certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, are of opinion, that all Pains of the Teeth are cauſed by a Worm, that gnaws and eats the Membranes and Nerves of the Teeth. This Notion is founded upon pretended Experiments on theſe Infects, which (as they report) by ſmoaking Hembane, will fall from the Teeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſome of the <hi>Doctors of Montpellier</hi> have been very prolix in their Accounts of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Worms; beſides the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries with their Glaſſes: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will be at the Pains to make ſome Trials with the Microſcope, may prove the Abſurdity of this Notion.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0148800900:37"/>
            <p>The Time in which the Caries ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages moſt of the Teeth, is between the Age of 25 and 50 Years.</p>
            <p>I have omitted the many Diviſions that may be ſeen in ſome Books upon this Subject; both on Account of their Perplexity and Non-uſe. For the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of what Kind or Cauſe ſoever, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces its Effects, more or leſs conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, according to the Parts of the Tooth they attack. And the Operations practiſed on theſe Occaſions are more or leſs difficult, according to the Situation of the Tooth; or according as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is more or leſs penetrating in the Body, or the Roots of the Teeth.</p>
            <p>Whenever the Caries is ſituated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gums, either on the Sides, or Extremity of the Tooth, the Cure will conſiſt in ſeparating the rotten Part from the ſound, by Exfoliation, with the File, the Rugine, Cautery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cavity with Wax (which muſt be often renewed) it will defend the boney and nervous Parts from the Air, or the Impreſſion of any other Bodies; likewiſe hinder any Bits of our Aliment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0148800900:38"/>from lodging in the Cavity, which are ſo apt to putrify and cauſe a ſtinking Breath.</p>
            <p>Altho' the Teeth,<note place="margin">Fractures.</note> in their natural Situation, are harder and more compact than the other Bones in the Body, and more remarkably ſo in the human Specie than Brutes, we find them by Experience extremely ſubject to break; eſpecially when the leaſt Defect happens in them.</p>
            <p>Their Fractures, are ſimple, compound, or Fiſſure.</p>
            <p>The Simple happens often by Falls and Blows, particularly by the Attempts to draw them before they are looſe: The Compound is when, their Roots are ſtrongly attached to their Alveoli, and a Piece of the Jaw comes away with Part of the Tooth: A Fiſſure is a Fracture lengthways, without any ſeeming Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Form of the Tooth.</p>
            <p>When once the Parts of the other Bones are divided, they never can be again united; for the Veſſels diſtributed in them are not ſo diſpoſed as to furniſh a Juice ſufficient, or that is capable of a Glutination; becauſe their proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0148800900:39"/>is too compact to give them Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; or their Motion, the Air, and Bodies that they touch, are Obſtacles that oppoſe the Re-union of the divided Parts.</p>
            <p>But tho' the Re-union of the Fracture be impracticable, the Scales, or Splinters, that remain, may be extracted, or their Angles and ſharp Points ſmoothed and poliſhed.</p>
            <p>All the Luxations the Bones ſuffer in their Articulations,<note place="margin">Luxations.</note> are either complete, or incomplete. When a Tooth is looſened, it is a Luxation incomplete.</p>
            <p>If after having been naturally well ſituated, they lean either in, or out of the Mouth, of one Side, or the other, they are ſo many Luxations.</p>
            <p>When a Tooth turns in the Alveoli, ſo that the lateral Parts of the Tooth incline, either outwards or inwards, 'tis a Luxation complete.</p>
            <p>When a Tooth ſeems to be longer, and exceed the others, that the Neck and Part of the Roots appear above the Edge of the Gums, occaſioned by ſome
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0148800900:40"/>Matter contained in the Alveoli, 'tis a Semi-luxation.</p>
            <p>The large Teeth are moſt frequently luxated inwards. The <hi>Inciſſores,</hi> on the contrary, generally luxate outwards: Altho' both theſe Diſlocations are bad, and incommode the Equality of Maſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet the Luxation inwards is the worſt, becauſe it fatigues and hurts the Tongue; which Uneaſineſs is more than the Inconvenience that is cauſed by the Teeth againſt the Lips, or Cheeks, when they fall outwards. The leaſt inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Luxation is, when the Tooth is only turned in the Cavity of the Alveoli.</p>
            <p>When the Teeth are luxated, in ſuch a manner as to exceed the others by their Extremities, which we call a Luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Diſlocation of the Bottom to the Top of the lower Jaw, or of the Top to the Bottom of the upper Jaw, the Maſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is very difficult.</p>
            <p>In all theſe Caſes, the Remedy is, to return them, each, in their proper Places, by which means they will often become quite faſt; to guard againſt the Cauſes of Luxations, and ſo fortify the Gums.</p>

            <head>On the Methods of Cleaning the Teeth with Obſervations on Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</head>
            <p>THE common Methods for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Colour of the Teeth, ſerve rather to blacken and deſtroy them: And I would caution the Public againſt the Uſe of all Remedies ſold with this Deſign; The Opiates, and many Medicines of different Titles, to my certain Knowledge, are compoſed of Brick, China, Rotten-ſtone, or other Ingredients of this Nature, powdered or levigated very fine, and coloured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fancy of the Inventors. It is very natural to conceive that theſe Powders muſt act upon the Teeth much in the ſame manner as a File, or the Duſts uſed in poliſhing Metals; by which means the enamel'd Subſtance will be wore away, and the long Part of the Tooth left bare, and defenceleſs to all Inſults.</p>
            <p>The white Salt, Scuttle-fiſh Bone, Salt of Tartar, Salt of Lead, Burnt-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0148800900:44"/>and other Ingredients of the ſame Species, the World has been long abuſed with.</p>
            <p>Juice of Sorrel, Juice of Lemons, Spirit of Allum, Spirit and Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, have been employed on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and tho' with the greateſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, have always in the End given them a yellow Colour, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. Nor is this the only bad Effect produced by theſe Liquors, for by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Application, they corrode, and eat little Holes in the Enamel of the Teeth: Notwithſtanding it is in the Uſe of theſe Remedies that conſiſt all the Secrets of our Quacks! and if we examine the Teeth of any of their Confidents (that ſeem to have reaped the greateſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from them) with a Microſcope, or even with the naked Eye, the Ravage they have made will eaſily ſhew us a ſure Foundation for a Caries.</p>
            <p>The Methods of cleaning the Teeth are various. Moſt People uſe ſmall Bruſhes, or Bits of Cloth or Linen, without any Suſpicion of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety, but they are much too rough, and by frequent indiſcreet Uſe,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0148800900:45"/>often ruin the Gums and Teeth. For this reaſon I would aboliſh their Uſe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a Piece of Spunge, dipped in warm Water, in which ſhould be diſſolved a Piece of Soap, to be uſed preferable to all other Methods whatever. Soap is known to be of a penetrating, attenuating and detergent Nature, and therefore not only moſt proper for cleaning the Teeth, but alſo very ſerviceable in moſt Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Gums; in ſhort, it may be uſed with the utmoſt Propriety; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Objection to be made, is the Offence it may give on account of its Taſte: but Cuſtom will render it familiar, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently recompenſe die Trouble of uſing it.</p>
            <p>I would recommend the Morning as the moſt convenient Time for cleaning the Teeth; but before uſing of the Spunge, it will be neceſſary to ſcrape off the gluey Subſtance, which adheres to their Surface, with a Quill; and after clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the Spunge and Soap, the Mouth may be rinced with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary Water, Spirit of Lavender, &amp;c. diluted with warm Water.</p>
            <p>The, Scurvy of the Gums is dependent
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0148800900:46"/>on the bad State of the Conſtitution, the relieving of which laſt will infallibly cure the other. When the Teeth become looſe, from whatever Cauſe, a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoonful of the <hi>Tincture of Myrrh,</hi> mixed with a Tea-cup-full of Water, to waſh the Mouth with twice or thrice a Day, will be the moſt efficacious Remedy.</p>
            <p>'Tis become a great Faſhion with the Engliſh Ladies, (and with too many of my own Sex) to have their Teeth ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and this Practice, ſhocking as it is, ſeems to be purſued with an uncommon Attention.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of this Operation is to beautify the Colour of the Teeth, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Tartar or Turf, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to their Surface, and is done with Iron Inſtruments, made for that Purpoſe. But whoever will conſider attentively the Nature of the Teeth, and of this petrified Subſtance, which I have already deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, will readily conceive the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of this Practice. 'Tis very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that by endeavouring to detach this Matter, ſome of the enamel'd Part may be taken away with it; and this not only depends on Hazard, but is the certain
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0148800900:47"/>Conſequence of frequent Uſe; indeed theſe Inſtruments themſelves, by often rubbing upon the Vitrious Subſtance, muſt riſque its Ruin, both as they are of a Nature too hard to approach the Teeth, and as their Mettalic Particles will inſinuate themſelves into the Pores of the Enamel, and never fail to produce great Michief.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be ſaid that this Matter may be removed by a dextrous Hand, one familiar in the Operation, without any ſuch Dangers, a brief Repetition of the Nature of the Diſeaſe will, I hope, prove a ſufficient Anſwer.</p>
            <p>The Tartar is generally accumulated on that Part of the Teeth which joins with the Gums, and covers more or leſs, according as it encreaſes in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, that Part we call the Neck of the Tooth, which it ſeparates from the Gum. This is the true State of the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe the Operator ever ſo dextrous, he muſt, in Conſequence of taking away this Matter, expoſe the Neck of the Tooth bare, and liable to all Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Air, the Aliment, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes near it; in which are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0148800900:48"/>many Cauſes of a Caries. This Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when left to itſelf, ſeldom fails of dropping off inſenſibly, and if 'tis the Colour only which induces us to try the Remedy, 'twould be much better to be content with this Inconvenience, than ſubject ourſelves to its ill Effects. But by following the Methods I have adviſed, there will be no neceſſity for expoſing ourſelves to this Operation.</p>
            <p>A certain Merchant in, the City, tho' otherwiſe ſufficiently covetous, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable Purſe upon one of our foreign Operators; who had in good Truth changed the Colour of his Teeth, from a Black to a very beautiful White: But behold the Conſequence! The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant found himſelf under a Neceſſity of beſpeakihg a new Sett; for they all actually fell out, one after the other: I ſaw him within three Months after the Operation, when he had only two remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Head. This is an Inſtance not without its Precedent.</p>
            <p>Thus it is that our curious Ladies and others, by endeavouring (by theſe unatural Means) to make their Teeth exceeding-white, will at length bring on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0148800900:49"/>a Caries, and render them black and frightful as well as uſeleſs. I am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to ſee ſo many pretending an Averſion to Foreigners, and yet ſuffer them (as we ſay of Sharpers, &amp;c.) to draw the furtheſt Teeth in their Heads, And I am ſtill more ſorry to ſee ſuch numbers of the fineſt Women become the Dupes of ſuch foreign Miſcreants.</p>

         <div type="list_of_diseases">
            <head>Diſeaſes of Children in the Time of Toothing.</head>
            <p>THE Teeth hardly make their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Mouth before they require ſome Succour from Surgery: The Caries is the firſt Diſeaſe that works their Ruin, and is their greateſt Enemy during Life; but even before their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the Diſeaſes they cauſe, we know by Experience, are conſiderable enough to take away Life.</p>
            <p>The firſt Appearance of Teeth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens commonly about ſeven Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Birth, and is attended with divers Accidents. The Symptoms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding their Appearance is an Itching
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0148800900:50"/>of the Gums, follow'd by a <hi>Ptyaliſmus,</hi> or Salivation of the Infant, eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by the great Quantity of Saliva running from the Mouth. After this follows the Swelling of the Gums, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with great Pain.</p>
            <p>If the Child has Strength to reſiſt, he will be attack'd with the <hi>Apthae,</hi> or little Ulcers, convex with a white Point: Theſe Ulcers are often engender'd by the moſt acrid and ſerous Parts of the Blood, formed moſt eaſily on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Membrane in the Mouth, being the moſt ſoft and tender. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the parotid Glands ſwell and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come conſiderable Abſceſſes.</p>
            <p>When the Teeth, eſpecially the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini,</hi> are upon the Point of piercing the Gums, the Itching is then turn'd into great Pain, with Swelling of the Cheeks and Eyes, Catarrhs, Fever, Diarrhea, Nauſea, Vomiting, Inſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, Convulſions, Lethargy, and too often the tragical Scene ends in Death.</p>
            <p>The Thirſt occaſioned by the Fever excites them to ſuck more than their little Stomachs are able to bear; and from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0148800900:51"/>hence follows that Indigeſtion, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, Vomiting, and Diarrhea, to which they are ſo ſubject.</p>
            <p>All the Symptoms happening to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the firſt Age are produced by the Compreſſion the Teeth make in divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gums : And 'tis remarkable that theſe Diſorders ſometimes happen to Children of a more advanced Age, tho' very ſeldom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Inciſores</hi> are more ſharp, and pierce the Gums with leſs Pain than the <hi>Canini.</hi> The <hi>Molares,</hi> as they are large and flat upon their Extremities, are the Occaſion of more Difficulty and Pain; but as they make their Appearance later than the others, the Child hath generally acquired greater Strength to reſiſt their Efforts.</p>
            <p>The Diſeaſes I have mentioned, are indeed more or leſs conſiderable, as the Child is more or leſs vigorous. <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> tells us, that thoſe who cut their Teeth in the Winter, are leſs liable to the Danger of the Fever, than in a warmer Seaſon: that when they have a Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhea, they are leſs ſubject to Convulſions;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0148800900:52"/>that the healthieſt-looking Children, and who ſleep ſound, are in Danger of being ſurprized with Convulſions, of which Death is not always the Conſequence.</p>
            <p>From theſe Prognoſtics we may judge of the Effects reſulting from a good or bad Conſtitution of the Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I would adviſe Mothers on theſe Occaſions to apply to a Man of Skill in the Profeſſion, and be extremely cautions of engaging in an Affair where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the leaſt Error may prove fatal.</p>
