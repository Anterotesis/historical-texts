            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>MACBETH RECONSIDERED.</head>
            <p>PLAYS are deſigned, by the joint powers of precept and example, to have a good influence on the lives of men. Enquiries into the conduct of fable in the drama were uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to this end: the regular, or irregular, diſpoſition of parts in a play is an artificial praiſe, or blame, that can contribute nothing to the improvement, or depravation, of the mind; for the cauſe of morality is promoted only, when, by a cataſtrophe reſulting from principles natural to the agents, who produce it, we are taught to love virtue, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Neglect of unity is the obvious fault of Shakſpeare's pieces, truth of manners their unrivalled excellence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0559100700:6"/>This Eſſay does not profeſs to obſerve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any inconſiſtency in the conduct of the tragedy of Macbeth, it concerns itſelf only with the ſentiments of the hero of it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming they will more effectually ſerve ethicks, if, in analyſing his character, it ſhews that there is no diſtinction between him and king Richard, in the quality of perſonal courage. If Macbeth be what Mr. Wheatley deſcribes him, we muſt forego our virtuous ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his repugnance to guilt, for it ariſes from mere cowardice; and can gain no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from his remorſe, for it is only the effect of imbecility; we deſpiſe him; we cannot feel for him; and ſhall never be amended by a wretch, who is uniformly the object of our contempt.</p>
            <p>The writer of theſe pages does not conſider, that his poſition will never be eſtabliſhed, till Mr. Wheatley's be overthrown, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how difficult, and apparently invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a taſk he undertakes; he relies, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon Shakſpeare to clear Macbeth from the imputation laid on his nature; and can truly ſay, the argument is not taken up in a ſpirit of controverſy, but out of a love for, what is believed to be, juſt criticiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0559100700:7"/>Having given many judicious proofs of the difference, there certainly is, in the characters of Macbeth and Richard, Mr. Wheatley pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the article of courage, and ſays, <hi>In Richard it is intrepidity, and in Macbeth no more than reſolution: in him</hi> [Macbeth] <hi>it proceeds from exertion, not from nature; in enterprize he betrays a degree of fear, though he is able, when occaſion requires, to ſtifle and ſubdue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The attempt to controvert this doctrine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſolves itſelf into three heads; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a repetition of the ſimple character of Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, as it ſtands before any change is effected in it by the ſupernatural ſoliciting of the weird ſiſters; a conſideration of his conduct towards Banquo, and Macduff; and a review of his deportment, as oppoſed to Richard's in the "Remarks." This order will involve an inquiry into Mr. Wheatley's interpretation of the poet's text; into the appoſiteneſs of the facts adduced in ſupport of hi opinion; and into his philoſophy of the pec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>liar paſſion of characters, when, facts not ſupplying teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, he can ſubſtantiate his hypotheſis only on the evidence of appropriated ſentiment.</p>
            <p>An appeal for judgement on the nature of Macbeth's courage lies to the tribunal of

Shakſpeare himſelf. The circumſcribed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a drama renders it generally imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable for the principal perſonages in it gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to unfold themſelves; it is, therefore, an allowed artifice with dramatic authors (and of which they commonly avail themſelves) by an impreſſive deſcription of their heroes to bring us, in a great meaſure, acquainted with them, before they are actually engaged in ſcenes, where, for want of ſuch previous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, their proceedings might appear, at beſt, confuſed, and generally, perhaps, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable. We are bound, then, to receive the introductory portrait our author has drawn of Macbeth as a true reſemblance; for a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the poet's arbitrary creation may be aſſimilated only to thoſe features, which he has thought fit to give him. Here is the picture.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—The mercileſs Macdonel</l>
               <l>—</l>

               <l>And fortune, on his damned quarrel ſmiling,</l>
               <l>Shew'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:</l>
               <l>For brave Macbeth, (well he deſerves that name)</l>
               <l>Diſdaining fortune, with his brandiſh'd ſteel,</l>
               <l>Which ſmoak'd with bloody execution,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0559100700:9"/>Like valour's minion, carved out his paſſage,</l>
               <l>'Till he fac'd the ſlave:</l>
               <l>And ne'er ſhook hands, nor bade farewel to him,</l>
               <l>'Till he unſeam'd him from the nave to the chops.</l>
               <bibl>(P. 446. v. 4.)</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Could Shakſpeare call a man brave, and inſiſt upon his well deſerving that appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; could he grace a man with the title of valour's minion, and deem him, as he does in a ſubſequent paſſage, worthy to be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even with the goddeſs of war;—could he do this, and not deſign to impreſs a full idea of the dignity of his courage? Macbeth's great heart pants to meet the mercileſs leader of the rebels; his executing ſword, all dyed in reek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gore, hews out a paſſage to him; he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the combat, 'till the death of his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt crowns his perſiſtive valour with the victory he burned for.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, Macbeth has <hi>reſolution,</hi> not <hi>intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity.</hi> What is the ſoldier's intrepidity, but diſdaining fortune?</p>
            <p>It is objected, though with ſome qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that Macbeth's courage <hi>proceeds from exertion, not from nature;</hi> and that in <hi>enterprize he betrays a deal of fear.</hi> Let us turn to the portrait once more.</p>

It cannot be the laboured effect of exertion, it is the ſpontaneous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of a dauntleſs nature, that again hurries Bellona's bridegroom, through all the horrors of a diſmal conflict, to ſingle out and hold the royal invader point againſt point, till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtleſs

            </q>
            <p>The king congratulates Macbeth on his ſucceſs; and profeſſes, that the praiſe, due to his perſonal venture in the firſt battle, is loſt in ſilent wonder at the ſublimity of his daring. How inexpreſſible, then, are Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can's feelings, when he finds him once more engaged, the ſelf-ſame day, in the ſtout

Norweyan ranks, careleſs of meeting that death, which he was ſo terribly dealing on the ſquadrons that ſurrounded him! The king confers the forfeited honours of the diſloyal Cawdor upon his general, only as a token of thoſe higher dignities, which all conſpire to think his atchievements in the kingdom's great defence have juſtly merited.</p>
            <p>Such is the character Shakſpeare attributes to Macbeth, while yet the pureneſs of his conſcience is uncontaminated by guilt. The impetuoſity of Glamis is the deciſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity; the feats of his own hand aſſure to him the renown of gallantry; and the whole tenour of his conduct, throughout this peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adventure, unequivocally diſplays a ſoul, that, with Othello's, may

            <p>We come now to the ſecond part of this queſtion. The "Remarks" affirm, that <hi>Macbeth is perſonally afraid of Banquo,</hi> and that <hi>his fear is founded on the ſuperior courage of the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The evidence, which is given in, of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo's ſuperior courage may, perhaps, on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0559100700:13"/>
ſeem but of little weight. Whence are the proofs of Macbeth's cowardice to be brought? Not from his behaviour in battle. It does not appear, that, <hi>upon the firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the witches, Macbeth is agitated much more than Banquo;</hi> Banquo's deſcription of their figures, and his <hi>ſeveral pertinent queſtions</hi> to them (amounting, though, to no more than two) are not expreſſive of <hi>mere curioſity,</hi> but of the ſurpriſe, with which himſelf and his partner are equally affected, on their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly encountering three objects of ſo groteſque an appearance,
<q>
                  <l>— What are theſe,</l>
                  <l>So wither'd, and ſo wild in their attire;</l>
                  <l>That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,</l>
                  <l>And yet are on't?—Live you? or are you ought</l>
                  <l>That man may queſtion?—</l>
                  <bibl>(P. 406. v. 4.)</bibl>
               </q>
If Macbeth <hi>only repeats the ſame inquiry,</hi> it is not from timidity, but from a wiſh for the ſame information; and when he does it <hi>ſhortly,</hi> he indicates his impatience for an anſwer.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould the ſpeeches of Macbeth and Banquo, in this ſcene, <hi>appear to be injudiciouſly diſtributed?</hi> And how will <hi>the difference in their characters account for ſuch a diſtribution?</hi> Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo addreſſes the witches firſt: Banquo is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0559100700:14"/>
made to ſee them firſt; not in token of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, but merely, perhaps, that their ceremonious ſilence to him,
<q>
                  <l>— each at once her choppy finger laying</l>
                  <l>Upon her ſkinny lips,—</l>
                  <bibl>(P. 406. v. 4.)</bibl>
               </q>
may heighten the ſolemnity of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic greeting, with which they are about to hail Macbeth. Yet, the diſtribution of the parts is of ſo little moment, that it might have happened fortuitouſly: to have done, however, with conjecture, the context evinces, that it is not produced for the purpoſe of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Banquo's ſuperiority, in <hi>being perfectly calm</hi> under an occurrence, that has <hi>ruffled</hi> Macbeth.</p>
            <p>If Macbeth <hi>is amazed, when he ſees the witches are vaniſhed,</hi> and likens their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to the melting of breath into the wind; Banquo is ſtruck too, and compares them, in their ſudden evaneſcence, to the burſting bubbles of the water.—(P. 464. v.4.)</p>
            <p>Banquo cannot be ſaid to <hi>treat the witches with contempt;</hi> he adjures them,—
<q>I' the name of truth;—
<bibl>(P. 462. v. 4.)</bibl>
               </q>
and, with Macbeth, gives them, in ſome ſort, credit for
<q>
                  <l>More than mortal knowledge.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0559100700:15"/>If you can look into the ſeeds of time,</l>
                  <l>And ſay, which grain will grow, and which will not;</l>
                  <l>Speak then to me, who neither beg, nor fear,</l>
                  <l>Your favours, nor your hate.—</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the language of manly firmneſs, not of contempt. He does not mean to <hi>ridicule their prophecy</hi> by anſwering to Macbeth's queſtion,
<q>
                  <l>Went it not ſo?</l>
                  <l>To the ſelf-ſame tune, and words.—</l>
                  <bibl>(P. 464. v.4.)</bibl>
               </q>
This is a grave, and preciſe, reply to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and intereſting, demand. It has been obſerved, from the higheſt critical authority, that Malcolm confirms the ſerious import of the ſpeech in queſtion, when he calls the effuſions of Macduff's grief and rage a manly "tune."—P. 586. v. 4.) It is plain, that Banquo's exclamation—,
<q>What, can the devil ſpeak true?—
<bibl>(P. 465. v. 4.)</bibl>
               </q>
on hearing part of the prophecy fulfilled, is dictated by wonder, not <hi>diſregard;</hi> for, when Macbeth takes occaſion, from that very event, to queſtion him on the hope, he now might
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0559100700:16"/>reaſonably entertain, of his family's advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſolemnly replies,
<q>
                  <l>— 'Tis ſtrange;</l>
                  <l>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,</l>
                  <l>The inſtruments of darkneſs tell us truths;</l>
                  <l>Win us with honeſt trifles, to betray us</l>
                  <l>In deepeſt conſequence.—</l>
                  <bibl>(P. 466. v. 4.)</bibl>
               </q>
Now let us advert to the ſubſequent effect, which the declarations of the ſiſters have upon Banquo's mind: he prays to be delivered from their temptations;
<q>
                  <l>—Merciful powers!</l>
                  <l>Reſtrain in me the curſed thoughts, that nature</l>
                  <l>Gives way to in repoſe!—</l>
                  <bibl>(P.492. v. 4.)</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Stevens, to whom every admirer of Shakſpeare muſt feel himſelf under high obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, obſerves upon this paſſage, <q>it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from what Banquo ſays afterwards</q>—[to Macbeth, "I dreamt laſt night of the three weird ſiſters,"]—<q>that he had been ſolicited in a dream to attempt ſomething, in conſequence of the prophecy of the witches, that his waking ſenſes were ſhock'd at.</q>—(P. 492. v. 4.) —Theſe horrible emotions could never have been
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0559100700:17"/>
cauſed in him by declarations, which he had contemned, ridiculed, or diſregarded. The adventure on the heath, therefore, does not prove Banquo's ſpirit greater than Macbeth's.</p>
            <p>The "Remarks" proceed thus, in proof of Macbeth's perſonal fear of Banquo; <hi>his principal object is the death of the father; and the ſecuring of his crown againſt Banquo's iſſue, who alone were pointed out to his jealouſy by the witches, is no more than a ſecondary conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Macbeth, when he <hi>confeſſes to Lady Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, that his mind is full of ſcorpions,</hi> ſhews Banquo not to be the ſole cauſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, by adding, "Thou know'ſt, that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives:" Moreover; directing the aſſaſſins, he tells them, the ſon's abſence is "no leſs material" to him, than the father's; he urges the death of Fleance on a motive diſtinct from cowardice; for, allowing, one moment, that he perſonally fear'd Banquo, it is impoſſible to conceive he could have felt the ſame dread of a boy: again; had his fears been perſonal they muſt have ended with the removal of the object of them; but finding the ſon has not fallen with the father, he is again involv'd in all his former apprehenſions.
<q>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0559100700:18"/>
                  <l>Fleance is 'ſcap'd.</l>
                  <l>Then comes my fit again.—</l>
                  <bibl>(P. 538. v. 4.)</bibl>
               </q>
The witches, it is true, only point out Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo's iſſue to Macbeth's jealouſy; but acual is not poſſible progeny, and the loſs of one child does not prevent a man from begetting others: thus, the ſecuring of his crown againſt Banquo's iſſue is ſo far from being a <hi>ſecondary,</hi> that it is the tyrant's only, inſtigation to this double murder.</p>
            <p>The original idea of Macbeth's perſonally fearing Banquo ſeems founded on theſe words;
<q>
                  <l>— our fears in Banquo</l>
                  <l>Stick deep;—</l>
               </q>
and,
<q>
                  <l>— There is none, but he,</l>
                  <l>Whoſe being I do fear,—</l>
                  <bibl>(P. 522. v, 4.)</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It will be eſſentially neceſſary, towards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the ſenſe of theſe ſtrong lines, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the train of reaſoning through the context of the ſpeech, from which they are taken.</p>
            <q>
               <l>To be thus, is nothing;</l>
               <l>But to be ſafely thus:—Our fears in Banquo</l>
               <l>Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature</l>
               <l>Reigns that, which would be fear'd: 'Tis much he dares;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0559100700:19"/>And, to that dauntleſs temper of his mind,</l>
               <l>He hath a wiſdom, that doth guide his valour</l>
               <l>To act in ſafety. There is none, but he,</l>
               <l>Whoſe being I do fear: and, under him,</l>
               <l>My genius is rebuk'd; as, it is ſaid,</l>
               <l>Mark Anthony's was by Caeſar. He chid the ſiſters,</l>
               <l>When firſt they put the name of king upon me,</l>
               <l>And bade them ſpeak to him; then, prophet-like,</l>
               <l>They hail'd him father to a line of kings:</l>
               <l>Upon my head they plac'd a fruitleſs crown,</l>
               <l>And put a barren ſceptre in my gripe,</l>
               <l>Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,</l>
               <l>No ſon of mine ſucceeding. If it be ſo,</l>
               <l>For Banquo's iſſue have I fil'd my mind;</l>
               <l>For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;</l>
               <l>Put rancours in the veſſel of my peace</l>
               <l>Only for them; and mine eternal jewel</l>
               <l>Given to the common enemy of man,</l>
               <l>To make them kings, the ſeed of Banquo kings!</l>
               <l>Rather than ſo, come, fate, into the liſt,</l>
               <l>And champion me to the utterance!—</l>
               <bibl>(ibid.)</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>In this ſoliloquy the uſurper reflects, that, after all he has done to obtain the crown, he is in great danger of loſing it; weighs the cauſes of that danger; and reſolves, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving them, to take effectual meaſures for the firmly eſtabliſhing of his ſupremacy. In other words;—</p>
            <p>I have poſſeſs'd myſelf of the ſovereignty; but to what avail, when, in a moment, it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0559100700:20"/>
may be wreſted from me? Banquo's eye is fix'd upon it; and there reigns in his very nature a royalty, that ſeems to realize his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations: he is not only a ſoldier of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bravery, but ſo conſummate a politician, that, ſhould he revolt againſt my govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he would infallibly carry his deſigns ſucceſsfully into execution. He is the only man alive, whoſe attempts I dread: and he holds as high an aſcendant over my good ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, as, it is ſaid, Caeſar did over Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony's. His hopes are not only ſtrengthen'd by his natural endowments, but embolden'd too by the aſſurances of prophecy: hearing me ſaluted king by the ſiſters, he bade them ſpeak to him; they obey'd; and hail'd him father to a line of kings; they plac'd a crown upon my head, and put a ſceptre in my hand, not to be tranſmitted to my own, but to be wrench'd away by the unlineal inheritance of his, children. If ſo, I ſhall have perpetrated ſuch crimes, as muſt embitter every moment of my life in this world, and forbid every hope of happineſs in the world to come, only to make the ſeed of Banquo kings! It muſt not be—I here oppoſe myſelf to the predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſolve by extirpating his family, to elude the decrees of fate itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0559100700:21"/>The uſurper, then, does not plunge into freſh crimes <hi>to get rid of perſonal fear</hi>—ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impels him to the murder of Duncan; and the ſame ambition urges him on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Banquo and Fleance, who ſeem deſtin'd to degrade him and his houſe from the ſplendors of monarchy to the obſcurity of vaſſalage.</p>
            <p>The "Remarks" find additional proofs of Macbeth's cowardice in his conduct towards Macduff—"<hi>The ſame motives of perſonal fear, and thoſe unmix'd with any other, impel him to ſeek the deſtruction of Macduff.</hi>"</p>

            </p>
            <p>It appears, however, that the perſons Macbeth open'd himſelf to, were not wrought to his purpoſe on their firſt interview; yet it does not diſconcert his deſigns; he ſends for them again, repeats his former converſation, and prevails with them by ſtrong arguments, and large promiſes, to undertake a murder, the execution whereof he ſteadily perſiſts in.

Notwithſtanding the firmneſs of this defiance, it cannot be ſuppos'd but Macbeth is as much terrify'd while he utters it, as Richard is, when, ſtarting out of a dream in which the ſouls of thoſe he had murder'd had appear'd to him, he cries,

It will be ſaid, and it will be granted, that Richard preſently ſtifles theſe emotions: it is only aſſerted that he feels them, like Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth; and that Macbeth, like him, can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them.—The wood of Birnam moves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Dunſinane—The tyrant

and, believing the laws of nature invented to his ruin,

The reſolution of both tyrants in the battles, that decided their fate, is that mix'd effuſion of grief, ſhame, and pride, which cannot be denominated leſs than the deſpair of innate bravery.</p>
            <p>If Macbeth's behaviour is to be called cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, when, overpowered by the completion of the prophecies, he, for a moment, declines the combat with Macduff; ſo muſt Richard's, when he flies with Haſtings before Warwick and Somerſet, leaving Edward to the mercy of the Lancaſtrians.—P. 52<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>From the review of the characters of the uſurpers, it appears not to be true of Richard, that</hi>

does he betray the leaſt ſymptom of fear;</q>—<hi>or of Macbeth, that he</hi> 
               <q>is always ſhaken upon great, and frequently upon trivial occaſions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Macbeth and Richard are each of them as intrepid as man can be: yet, it may be ſaid of each, without any derogation from that character, that he is, at times, agitated with apprehenſions. The Earl of Peterborough has left it upon record, that intrepidity and ſenſe of danger are by no means incompatible.</p>
            <p>Having endeavour'd to prove, that Macbeth has a juſt right to the reputation of intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity; that he feels no perſonal dread of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo and Macduff; and that he meets equal, not to ſay ſuperior, trials, as boldly as Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; it may be expected this eſſay ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſhew in what the eſſential difference between theſe great bad men conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Ambition is the impulſe that governs every action of Richard's life; he attains the crown by diſſimulation, that owns no reſpect for virtue; and by cruelty, which entails no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe on the va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our, that wou'd maintain his ill-acquir'd dignity. Ambition is the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant vice of Macbeth's nature; but he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies it by hypocriſy, that reveres virtue too highly to be perfectly itſelf; and by murders,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0559100700:38"/>
the recollection whereof, at times, renders his valour, uſeleſs by depriving him of all fenſe, but that of his enormous wickedneſs. Richard's character is ſimple, Macbeth's mix'd. Richard is only intrepid, Macbeth intrepid, and feeling. Richard's mind not being diverted by reflection from the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his ſituation, he is always at full leiſure to diſplay his valour; Macbeth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by remorſe, loſes all apprehenſion of danger in the contemplation of his guilt; and never recurs to his valour for ſupport, till the enemy's approach rouzes his whole ſoul, and conſcience is repell'd by the neceſſity for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion.</p>
            <p>The writer of the above pages cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude without ſaying, he read the <q>Remarks on ſome of Shakſpeare's Characters</q> with ſo much general pleaſure and conviction, that he wiſhes his approbation were conſiderable enough to increaſe the celebrity which Mr. Wheatley's memory has acquir'd from a work, ſo uſefully intended, and ſo elegantly perform'd.</p>
