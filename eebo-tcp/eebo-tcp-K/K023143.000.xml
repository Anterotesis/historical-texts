            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God the Patron of Both.

            </p>
            <p>I muſt take leave to make you my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, whether you will or no; though out of the Reſpect I have for you, I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to apply Lenitive than Corroſive Medicines, happy, if they may prove an Emetic ſufficient to make you cast up thoſe Errors, which you have imbibed in your Education, and which, I hope, I ſhall never live to ſee this Nation digest.</p>
            <p>Sir, I cannot but lament, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of your acute Wit, rectified Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſublimated Imagination, ſhould miſapply thoſe Talents to raiſe ill Humours in the Conſtitution of the Body Politick, of which your ſelf are a Member, and upon the Health whereof your own Preſervation depends. Give me leave to ſay, ſuch
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0537700900:4"/>
Principles as yours would again reduce us to the fatal Neceſſity of the Phlebotomy of War, or the Cauſticks of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>In order to inform you of this, I have ſought your Acquaintance and Converſation with the utmost diligence; for I hoped in Perſon to perſuade you to a publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of your Fault, and a Recantation of theſe dangerous Tenets. But finding all my Endeavours ineffectual, and being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Conſcience of having done all that became a Man of an honeſt Heart and honourable Intention; I could no longer omit my Duty in opening the Eyes of the World by the Publication of this Diſcourſe. It was indeed written ſome Months ſince, but ſeems not the leſs proper at this Juncture, when I find ſo univerſal an Encouragement given by both Parties, to the Author of a libellous Work that is deſigned equally to prejudice them both. The uncommon Sale of this Book (for above 6000 of'em have been already vended) was alſo a farther Reaſon that call'd aloud upon me to put a ſtop to its further Progreſs, and to preſerve
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0537700900:5"/>
his Majeſty's Subjects by expoſing the whole Artifice of your Poem in publick.</p>
            <p>Sir, to addreſs my ſelf to ſo florid a Writer as you, without collecting all the Flowers of Rhetorick, would be an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable <hi>Indecorum;</hi> but when I ſpeak to the World, as I do in the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I muſt uſe a ſimple Stile, ſince it would be abſurd to preſcribe an univerſal Medicine, or <hi>Catholicon,</hi> in a Language not univerſally underſtood.</p>

            </head>
            <p>SINCE this unhappy Diviſion of our Nation into Parties, it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined how many Artifices have been made uſe of by Writers to obſcure the Truth, and cover Deſigns, which may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental to the Publick; in particular, it has been their Cuſtom of late to vent their Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spleen in Allegory and Fable. If an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt believing Nation is to be made a Jeſt of, we have a Story of <hi>John Bull</hi> and his Wife; if a Treaſurer is to be glanced at, an <hi>Ant</hi> with a <hi>white Straw</hi> is introduced; if a Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is to be ridiculed, 'tis immediately me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſed into a Tale of Count <hi>Tariff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any of theſe Malevolents have never ſo ſmall a Talent in Rhime, they principally delight to convey their Malice in that pleaſing way, as it were, gilding the Pill, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the Poyſon under the Sweetneſs of Numbers. Who could imagine that an <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0537700900:7"/>
               <hi>Canto</hi> of <hi>Spencer</hi> ſhould contain a Satyr upon one Adminiſtration; or that <hi>Yarhel</hi>'s <hi>Kitchin,</hi> or the <hi>Dogs of Egypt,</hi> ſhould be a Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſm upon another.</p>
            <p>It is the Duty of every well deſigning Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to prevent, as far as in him lies, the ill Conſequences of ſuch pernicious Treatiſes; and I hold it mine to warn the Publick of the late Poem, entituled, the <hi>RAPE of the LOCK;</hi> which I ſhall demonſtrate to be of this nature. Many of theſe ſort of Books have been bought by honeſt and well-meaning People purely for their Diverſion, who have in the end found themſelves inſenſibly led into the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Party Spirit, and many domeſtick Quarrels have been occaſioned by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Application of theſe Books. The Wife of an eminent Citizen grew very noiſy upon reading <hi>Bob Huſh; John Bull,</hi> upon <hi>Change,</hi> was thought not only to concern the State, but to affront the City; and the Poem we are now treating of, has not only diſſolved an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Aſſembly of Beaus and Belles, but (as I am told) has ſet Relations at as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as if they were married together.</p>
            <p>It is a common and juſt Obſervation, that when the Meaning of any thing is dubious, one can no way better judge of the true Intent of it, than by conſidering who is the Author, what is his Character in general, and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0537700900:8"/>
Now that the Author of this Poem is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> is well known; and that a Genius ſo capable of doing Service to that Cauſe, may have been corrupted in the Courſe of his Education by <hi>Jeſuits</hi> or others, is juſtly very much to be ſuſpected; notwithſtanding that ſeeming <hi>Coolneſs</hi> and <hi>Moderation,</hi> which he has been (perhaps artfully) reproached with, by thoſe of his own Profeſſion. They are ſenſible that this Nation is ſecured with good and wholeſome Laws to prevent all evil Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> particularly the Publication of Books, that may in any ſort propagate that Doctrine: Their Authors are therefore obliged to couch their Deſigns the deeper; and tho' I cannot averr that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of this Gentleman was directly to ſpread Popiſh Doctrines, yet it comes to the ſame Point, if he touch the Government: For the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> knows very well, that the Church at this time is ſo firmly founded on the State, that the only way to ſhake the one is by attacking the other.</p>
            <p>What confirms me in this Opinion, is an accidental Diſcovery I made of a very artful Piece of Management among his Popiſh Friends and Abettors, to hide this whole Deſign upon the Government, by taking all the Characters upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>Upon the Day that this Poem was publiſhed, it was my Fortune to ſtep into the <hi>Cocoa Tree,</hi> where a certain Gentleman was railing very
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0537700900:9"/>
liberally at the Author, with a Paſſion extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well counterfeited, for having (as he ſaid) reflected upon him in the Character of <hi>Sir Plume.</hi> Upon his going out, I enquired who he was, and they told me, <hi>a Roman Catholick Knight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was the ſame Evening at <hi>Will</hi>'s, and ſaw a Circle round another Gentleman, who was railing in like manner, and ſhowing his Snuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box and Cane to prove he was ſatyrized in the ſame Character. I asked this Gentleman's Name, and was told, he was <hi>a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Day or two after I was ſent for, upon a ſlight Indiſpoſition, to the young Lady's to whom the Poem is dedicated. She alſo took up the Character of <hi>Belinda</hi> with much Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good Humour, tho' the Author has given us a Key in his <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q rend="inline">The Character of <hi>Belinda</hi> (as it is here manag'd) reſemble you in nothing but in Beauty. <bibl>Dedication to the <hi>Rape of the Lock.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But to proceed to the Work it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In all things which are intricate, as Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories in their own Nature are, and eſpecially
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0537700900:10"/>
thoſe that are induſtriouſly made ſo, it is not to be expected we ſhould find the Clue at firſt ſight; but when once we have laid hold on that, we ſhall trace this our Author through all the Labyrinths, Doublings and Turnings of this intricate Compoſition.</p>
            <p>Firſt then let it be obſerved, that in the moſt demonſtrative Sciences ſome <hi>Poſtulata</hi> are to be granted, upon which the reſt is naturally founded. I ſhall deſire no more than one <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulatum</hi> to render this obvious to the meaneſt Capacity; which being granted me, I ſhall not only ſhew the Intent of this Work in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but alſo explain the very <hi>Names,</hi> and expoſe all his fictitious <hi>Characters</hi> in their true Light; and we ſhall find, that even his <hi>Spirits</hi> were not meerly contrived for the ſake of <hi>Machinary.</hi>

               </q> 'Tis remarkable, this General is a great Taker of Snuff as well as Towns; his Conduct of the clouded Cane gives him the Honour which is ſo juſtly his due, of an exact Conduct in Battle, which is figured by his Truncheon, the Enſign of a General. His earneſt Eye, or the Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his Look, is ſo particularly remarkable in him that this Character could be miſtaken for no other, had not this Author purpoſely obſcur'd it by the fictitious Circumſtance of a <hi>round, unthinking Face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now explained the chief Characters of his <hi>Human Perſons</hi> (for there are ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that will hereafter fall in by the by, in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe) I ſhall next take in pieces his <hi>Machinary,</hi> wherein his Satyr is wholly confined to Miniſters of State.</p>
            <p>The SYLPHS and GNOMES at firſt ſight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me to ſignify the two contending Parties of this Nation; for theſe being placed in the <hi>Air,</hi> and thoſe on the <hi>Earth,</hi> I thought agreed very well with the common Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, HIGH and LOW. But as they are made to be the firſt Movers and Influencers of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0537700900:15"/>
all that happens, 'tis plain they repreſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeuouſly the <hi>Heads of Parties,</hi> whom he makes to be the Authors of all thoſe Changes in the State, which are generally imputed to the Levity and Inſtability of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <q>
                  <l>This erring Mortals Levity may call.</l>
                  <l>Oh blind to Truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.</l>
               </q>
But of this he has given us a plain Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for ſpeaking of theſe Spirits, he ſays in expreſs Terms.<q>
                  <l>—The chief the Care of Nations own,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p> And here let it not ſeem odd, if in this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious way of Writing, we find the ſame Perſon, who has before been repreſented by the <hi>Baron,</hi> again deſcribed in the Character of <hi>Ariel;</hi> it being a common way with Authors, in this fabulous Manner, to take ſuch a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As for inſtance, I have read in the <hi>Engliſh St. Evremont,</hi> that all the different Characters in <hi>Petronius</hi> are but <hi>Nero</hi> in ſo many different Appearances. And in the Key to the curious Romance of <hi>Barclay</hi>'s <hi>Argenis,</hi> that both <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi> and <hi>Archombrotus</hi> mean only the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0537700900:16"/>
We obſerve in the very Beginning of the Poem, that <hi>Ariel</hi> is poſſeſs'd of the Ear of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda;</hi> therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary that this Perſon muſt be the Miniſter who was neareſt the Queen.

               </q> He has here particularized the Ladies and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Bed-Chamber, the Keeper of the Cabinet, and her M<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0537700900:17"/>
To put this Matter beyond all diſpute, the <hi>Sylphs</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>wond'rous fond of Place,</hi> in the Canto following, where <hi>Ariel</hi> is perched uppermoſt, and all the reſt take their Places ſubordinately under him.</p>
            <p>Here again I cannot but obſerve, the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Malignity of this Author, who could not leave this Character of <hi>Ariel</hi> without the ſame invidious Stroke which he gave him in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Baron</hi> before. <q>
                  <l>Amaz'd, confus'd, he ſaw his Pow'r expir'd,</l>
                  <l>Reſign'd to Fate, and with a Sigh retir'd.</l>
               </q>
Being another Prophecy that he ſhould reſign his Place, which it is probable all Miniſters do with a Sigh.</p>
            <p>At the Head of the <hi>Gnomes</hi> he ſets <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbriel,</hi> a dusky melancholy Spright, who makes it his Buſineſs to give <hi>Belinda</hi> the Spleen; a vile and malicious Suggeſtion againſt ſome grave and worthy Miniſter. The Vapours, Fantoms, Viſions, and the like, are the Jealouſies, Fears, and Cries of Danger, that have ſo often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted and alarm'd the Nation. Thoſe who are deſcribed in the Houſe of Spleen under thoſe ſeveral fantaſtical Forms, are the ſame whom their Ill-willers have ſo often called the <hi>Whimſical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two foregoing Spirits being the only conſiderable Characters of the Machinary, I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0537700900:18"/>
ſhall but juſt mention the <hi>Sylph</hi> that is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Sciſſars at the Loſs of the Lock, by whom is undoubtedly underſtood my L<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But I muſt not conclude this Head of the Characters, without obſerving, that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has run through every Stage of Beings in ſearch of Topicks for Detraction; and as he has characterized ſome Perſons under Angels and Men, ſo he has others under Animals, and things inanimate. He has repreſented an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Clergy-man as a Dog, and a noted Writer as a Tool. Let us examine the former.<q>

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0537700900:20"/>
The Game at <hi>Ombre</hi> is a myſtical Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the late War, which is hinted by his making Spades the Trump; Spade in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſignifying a Sword, and being yet ſo painted in the Cards of that Nation; to which it is well known we owe the Original of our Cards. In this one Place indeed he has unawares paid a Compliment to the Queen, and her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the War; for <hi>Belinda</hi> gets the better of the two that play againſt her, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not queſtion but ev'ry particular Card has its Perſon and Character aſſigned, which, no doubt, the Author has told his Friends in private; but I ſhall only inſtance in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Diſgrace under which the D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That the Author here had an Eye to our modern Tranſactions, is very plain from an unguarded Stroke towards the End of this Game.<q>

            <p>After the Concluſion of the War, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Rejoicings and <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> are ridiculed in the two following Lines. <q>

                  <l>The Walls, the Woods, and long Canals reply.</l>
               </q>
Immediately upon which there follows a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Inſinuation, in the manner of a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (which we have formerly obſerv'd this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Writer delights in) that the Peace ſhould continue but a ſhort time, and that the Day ſhould afterwards be curſt which was then celebrated with ſo much Joy.<q>
                  <l>Sudden theſe Honours ſhall be ſnatch'd away,</l>
                  <l>And curſt for ever this Victorious Day.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As the Game at <hi>Ombre</hi> is a ſatyrical Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the late War; ſo is the Tea-Table that enſues, of the Council-Table and its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations after the Peace.

and Tea, or things of no greater Value. That he thought of the Trade in this Place, appears by the Paſſage where he repreſents the <hi>Sylphs</hi> particularly careful of the <hi>rich Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade;</hi> it having been a frequent Complaint of our Mercers, that <hi>French Brocades</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in too great Quantities.

            <p>Upon the whole, it is manifeſt he meant ſomething more than common Coffee, by his calling it,

The enſuing Contentions of the Parties upon the Loſs of that Treaty, are deſcribed in the Squabbles following the Rape of the Lock; and this he raſhly expreſſes, without any diſguiſe in the Words. <q>

            <p>I come next to the <hi>Bodkin,</hi> ſo dreadful in the Hand of <hi>Belinda;</hi> by which he intimates the <hi>Britiſh Scepter</hi> ſo rever'd in the Hand of our late Auguſt Princeſs. His own Note upon this Place tells us he alludes to a Scepter; and the Verſes are ſo plain, they need no Remark.<q>
                  <l>The ſame (his antient Perſonage to deck)</l>
                  <l>Her great great Grandſire wore about his Neck</l>
                  <l>In three Seal Rings, which, after melted down,</l>
                  <l>Form'd a vaſt Buckle for his Widow's Gown;</l>
                  <l>Her Infant Grandame's Whiſtle next it grew,</l>
                  <l>The Bells ſhe gingled, and the Whiſtle blew,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0537700900:24"/>
Then in a Bodkin grac'd her Mother's Hairs,</l>
                  <l>Which long ſhe wore, and now <hi>Belinda</hi> wears.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>An open Satyr upon <hi>Hereditary Right.</hi> The three Seal Rings plainly allude to the three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the chief Paſſages in the Battle, by which, as hath before been ſaid, he means the Squabble of Parties. Upon this Occaſion he could not end the Deſcription of them, without teſtifying his malignant Joy at thoſe Diſſentions, from which he forms the Proſpect that <hi>both</hi> ſhould be diſappointed, and cries out with Triumph, as if it were already accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.<q>
                  <l>Behold how oft ambitious Arms are crost,</l>
                  <l>And Chiefs contend till all the Prize is lost.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Lock at length is turn'd into a <hi>Star,</hi> or the Old Barrier Treaty into a new and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Peace;</hi> this no doubt is what the Author, at the time he printed his Poem, would have been thought to mean, in hopes by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to eſcape Puniſhment for the reſt of his Piece. It puts me in mind of a Fellow, who concluded a bitter Lampoon upon the Prince and Court of his Days, with theſe Lines.<q>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0537700900:25"/>
                  <l>God ſave the King, the Commons, and the Peers,</l>
                  <l>And grant the Author long may wear his Ears.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever this Author may think of that Peace, I imagine it the moſt <hi>extraordinary Star</hi> that ever appear'd in our Hemiſphere. A Star that is to bring us all the Wealth and Gold of the <hi>Indies;</hi> and from whoſe Influence, not Mr. <hi>John Partridge</hi> alone, (whoſe worthy Labours this Writer ſo ungenerouſly ridicules) but all true <hi>Britains</hi> may, with no leſs Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than he, prognoſticate the Fall of <hi>Lewis,</hi> in the Reſtraint of the exorbitant Power of <hi>France,</hi> and the Fate of <hi>Rome</hi> in the triumphant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have now conſidered this Poem in its Political View, wherein we have ſhewn that it hath two different Walks of Satyr, the one in the Story it ſelf, which is a Ridicule on the late Tranſactions in general; the other in the Machinary, which is a Satyr on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State in particular. I ſhall now ſhow that the ſame Poem, taken in another Light, has a Tendency to Popery, which is ſecretly inſinuated through the whole.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, he has conveyed to us the Doctrine of Guardian Angels and Patron Saints in the Machinary of his <hi>Sylphs,</hi> which being a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0537700900:26"/>
Piece of Popiſh Superſtition that hath been endeavoured to be exploded ever ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, he would here revive under this Diſguiſe. Here are all the Particulars which they believe of thoſe Beings, which I ſhall ſum up in a few Heads.</p>

So St. <hi>George</hi> is imagined by the Papiſts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>England;</hi> St. <hi>Patrick, Ireland;</hi> St. <hi>James, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. Now what is the Conſequence of all this? By granting that they have this Power, we muſt be brought back again to pray to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Toilette</hi> is an artful Recommendation of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and pompous Ceremonies of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> The <hi>unveiling</hi> of the <hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>Silver Vaſes</hi> upon it, being <hi>rob'd</hi> in <hi>White,</hi> as the Prieſts are upon the chief Feſtivals, and the <hi>Head uncover'd,</hi> are manifeſt Marks of this.

            <p>The Character of <hi>Belinda,</hi> as we take it in this third View, repreſents the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the Whore of <hi>Babylon;</hi> who is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the State this malevolent Author wiſhes for, coming forth in all her Glory upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> and overſpreading the Nation with Ceremonies.<q>

After which he tells us,

                  <l>If to her Share ſome Female Errors fall,</l>
                  <l>Look on her Face, and you'll forget them all.</l>
               </q>
Tho' it ſhould be granted ſome Errors fall to her ſhare, look on the pompous Figure ſhe makes throughout the World, and they are not worth regarding. In the Sacrifice following ſoon after, you have theſe two Lines. <q>
                  <l>For this, e'er <hi>Phoebus</hi> roſe, he had implor'd</l>
