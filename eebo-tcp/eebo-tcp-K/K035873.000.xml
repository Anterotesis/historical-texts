            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Diſſenters Anſwer
TO THE
High-Church Challenge.</head>
            <p>AS it is the Character of the Devil to
bring a Railing Accuſation, ſo no
Man of Sence or Manners cares to
imitate him; all Men of Learning,
that ever I met with, will allow that People
may Differ, Debate and Diſpute, without <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſgate</hi>
Language; that Invidious Names,
and Indecent Reproaches, ſerve to gratifie the
Spleen, and flow from a Redundancy of Gall
in the Author, but add no manner of Force
to his Argument; good Words are as ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as bad; and the Satyr lyes in the Truth,
not the ill Language, of the Book.</p>
            <p>From this Principle, the Author of a late
Pamphlet, with a Title as long as a Book,
and call'd, <hi>The Wolf Stript,</hi> muſt not expect a
Return of Dirt for Dirt; and while he calls
every Man by his Name, and yet is aſham'd of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0557101200:4"/>
his own, calls moſt Men out of their Names,
and fills his Book with the Exuberance of his
Hypochondriack Vapours, he ought to be look'd
upon as an Author not worth while to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with; if a Gentleman ſhould fight with
a Chimney-ſweeper, he may beat the Man,
but he will daub himſelf ſo much, will ſtink
of the Soot, and foul his Cloaths, that the
Victory is not worth the Diſorder 'twill put
him into.</p>
            <p>In like manner, he that will deal with this
Author in his own Way, muſt foul his Mouth
with ſo much Bear-Garden Language, ſuch
rude, unmannerly, and unſcholar-like, Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
that he muſt be tainted with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Savour of his Enemy's Malignancy,
and look like the Man he meddles with as not
worth any Man's while.</p>
            <p>Upon this Account I ſhall not meddle with
his Voluminous Tract it ſelf; but as he has
made a fair Challenge in the Eighth Page of his
Book to all the Diſſenters, I am willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little in the Caſe; not ſo much expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſilence a Tongue pointed with Raillery,
but to let the World know that the Diſſenters
are not unprovided with ſtrong Arguments to
defend a juſt Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Challenge that this Gentleman has
made to the World, and of which he ſeems ſo
very confident, is as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0557101200:5"/>
The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> make a Heavy <hi>Noiſe,</hi> That the
<hi>Church</hi> will not Purchaſe a <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> with
the giving up only of a few <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things,
which Offend their Tender <hi>Conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Low-Church</hi> lay the Blame upon the
<hi>High-Church,</hi> (with very ſevere <hi>Reflections</hi>)
That they are <hi>Obſtructers</hi> of this Bleſſed <hi>Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let none of theſe be <hi>Judges</hi> in their own <hi>Cauſe.</hi>
Therefore let the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> give in to the Preſent
<hi>Convocation</hi> a <hi>Liſt</hi> of ſuch <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things,
which, if <hi>Granted,</hi> they will <hi>Promiſe</hi> to <hi>Conform,</hi>
and Heal the <hi>Schiſm.</hi> The <hi>Scruples</hi> are <hi>Theirs.</hi>
Therefore they muſt make the <hi>Propoſal.</hi> None others
can tell what will <hi>Satisfie</hi> them.</p>
            <p>If they will not do this, Let them ſtop their <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
and Never more ſay, That nothing will be
<hi>Granted</hi> them! And that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
has no mind to Heal the <hi>Schiſm!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if they will do this, then it will appear, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>High</hi> or the <hi>Low-Church</hi> will go Fartheſt
to Purchaſe this Deſir'd <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> and which
of them do, in good Earneſt, Wiſh it, and not rather
to keep open the <hi>Breach,</hi> to ſerve other <hi>Deſigns!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, let thoſe of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> who were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Imploy'd in this Grand <hi>Project</hi> of <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
(of which they have made ſuch Boaſts) lay
before the <hi>Houſe</hi> the Grounds and the Terms of it;
that it may appear they were none but <hi>Indifferent</hi>
Things, which were to be Given up to the <hi>Diſſenters!</hi>
Otherwiſe, let Them too <hi>Ceaſe</hi> their <hi>Railing</hi> at the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0557101200:6"/>
               <hi>High-Church,</hi> as Men of Violent Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
for <hi>Obſtructing</hi> their <hi>Deſigns!</hi> Or, for <hi>Suſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
what-they were!</p>
            <p>The <hi>High-Church</hi> Deſire, That they, and the
<hi>Low-Church,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> too, may be
<hi>Try'd</hi> by their <hi>Actions,</hi> and not by the <hi>Clamours</hi>
on either Side. And that they may be Heard <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,</hi>
in the Face of the World, by the <hi>Method</hi>
Propos'd.</p>
            <p>And Whoever <hi>Refuſe</hi> this, and cannot Propoſe a
more <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Convincing</hi> Way, for the
<hi>Clearing</hi> of <hi>Themſelves,</hi> let <hi>Them</hi> be <hi>Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had this been a new Challenge, this Author
might have had ſome Reaſon to have expected
it ſhould have been accepted and replied to.</p>
            <p>But ſince I find his Reading as ſhort as his
Cenſure is haſty, I think the propereſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
is to reviſe what of this Kind has been
already done, and to put him in Mind that all
he has ſaid only ends in this Abſurdity of
arguing, <hi>viz.</hi> The Diſſenters have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
been challeng'd to this, have accepted the
Challenge, undertaken the Defence of
their Doctrine, and of their Diſſenting, have
effectually vindicated themſelves from the
Charge of Schiſm, given Reaſons for
their Scruples, and made Propoſals for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;
they have challeng'd the Church to
Union and Peace, they have defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0557101200:7"/>
from the Charge of Diſloyalty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and offered the Church to bring their
Loyalty to the Teſt with them; and none of
theſe things have ever been Anſwer'd, or ſome
of them not ſo much as Reply'd to.</p>
            <p>Now as this Gentleman ſupplies Matter
of Fact with Indecency and Railery, I ſhall
not need to follow him there; he begins the
very firſt Page of his Book with Three poſitive
Falſities, neither of which he can in the leaſt
tollerable manner make out.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they have a Society of
Writers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Diſſenters find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
worſted in Argument.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Page he tells us, <hi>Tis the Method
of the Diſſenters not to mind any Anſwer, but to
repeat and repeat their own Objections</hi> IN INFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITUM.</p>
            <p>'Tis
far from my Deſign to Reply to a Book
as full of Abſurdities and Contradictions as
it is Verboſe and Malignant, and therefore I
ſhall content my ſelf with theſe Three Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>1.
As to the Diſſenters having a Society of
Writers, I am ſo well ſatisfied of its being a
Forgery of his own, that I Challenge him to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0557101200:8"/>
make appear that there is ſo much as a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
among them of any Two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that have ever Wrote in the Behalf of
the Diſſenters; and as he is mighty forward
to print Names, and to abuſe them by Name
too, he is welcome to ſet down their Names
if he can: In which, if he purſue his uſual
Method of preſuming things are ſo, and then
affirming it as poſitively as if he cou'd prove
it, he will certainly Enſnare and Expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as much in the Particulars as he has
done now in the General.</p>
            <p>Had the Diſſenters ſo much Unanimity
among themſelves, as he pretends they have,
they would have too great a ſhare in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Regard, to let ſuch a hard-mouth'd
Author Treat them in ſo Scurrilous a Manner
as he does; the Government would ſuppreſs
the Spirit of Railery in the Mouths of theſe
Enflamers, that they ſhould not have
ſuch a full Liberty of Traducing and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their Bretheren, in order to keep open
the Breach, which 'tis every True <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant's
Deſire and Intereſt to ſee heal'd.</p>
            <p>No, Sir, the Diſſenters have no ſuch So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties;
the Spirit of Union, <hi>the more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
for them,</hi> is not ſo much among them;
they are all forward enough to have any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſerve them, but it muſt be at their own
Hazard, and at their own Expence, which a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0557101200:9"/>
late unhappy Author of theirs very lately
had Experience of enough to warn any Man
from venturing to ſerve them again.</p>
            <p>But therefore, Sir, is it plain that this Book
is far from being Wrote as a Deſign of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but with the Sence of Truth, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Honeſt Man has a Right to Vindicate.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, Sir, I affirm your Party
has, and ever had, a Society of Writers; and
whenever you deſire it, I am ready to gratifie
you with ſome of their Names; tho' I am not
forward of printing Names, as a piece of Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
unbecoming an Author: But a certain
Weekly Paper now in Courſe is Publickly
own'd to be ſo wrote; and I know Perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the wretched Performance has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
ſome Conſiderations among People of
greater Capacities, to provide a Set of Men
to do it better, and to gratifie them for the
Service.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, I ſhall not enter upon the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Work of Recrimination, as a thing in
which there is ſo much room for launching
out, that the compaſs of this ſmall Tract
would be too ſtraight for it.</p>
            <p>2. You tell us, <hi>The Faction,</hi> which is your
Civil Term for the Diſſenters, <hi>find themſelves
worſted in Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had been time enough to have boaſted thus
when you had put your Armour off, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0557101200:10"/>
when the many Tracts wrote by the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in their own juſt Vindication have been
Anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>But this Gentleman has the Misfortune ſo
to be blinded by his Paſſion, as to cry <hi>Victoria</hi>
before the Battle is ended; and not to trouble
you, Sir, with many Negatives, I wiſh you
would let us ſee <hi>one Time</hi> whenever by any
thing but Railery you <hi>worſted</hi> the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>We
confeſs, Sir, that at ill Language you
have the better of us; whether you have any
Profeſſors of the Scolding Talent among your
Students we know not, for you will not
ſuffer us to be Taught in your Univerſities;
but we aſſure you, that in thoſe Schools where
we are fain to bring up our Youth, we Teach
no ſuch Science.</p>
            <p>But as if all you had laid down on that
Head were true, and you were very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that you had worſted the Diſſenters in
Argument, you give them a home Charge.</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>'tis their Method not to mind Anſwers,
but to Repeat and Repeat their own Objections</hi> In
Infinitum.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, This may or may not be true,
according as you can or cannot give a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Anſwer to the following Account of
Anſwers given, and Books written; by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
in their own Vindication, which you,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0557101200:11"/>
nor any of your Church, have ever yet
thought fit to venture an Anſwer to, and
<hi>when you can</hi> you may defend your Church
from unfair Treatment of the Diſſenters in
point of Argument on this Head.</p>
            <p>And not to go too far beyond the Memory
of thoſe we are talking to, I think there
ſtands Two Books of the Learned Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi>
yet unanſwered, the one Entituled, <hi>No Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Evidence for Dioceſian Biſhops;</hi> and the other,
<hi>A Diſcourſe of Liturgies.</hi> 'Tis true, there is a
long and learned Diſcourſe of Dr. <hi>Comber</hi>'s
then <hi>Precentor</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> wherein with ſome of
our Author's Spirit, Treating the Memory of
Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> neither like a Gentleman nor a
Scholar, tho' all Men know he was as much
of both as ever the Nation bred; and tho' a
Diſſenter, had the Honour to be Tutor to
the Learned and moſt Excellent Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi>
late Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Author has pleaſed himſelf with
ſufficiently reproaching his Deceaſed Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,
he goes on to rummage Antiquity to
prove that Liturgies were in uſe in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church. This was no part of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;
and had not the Doctor overlook'd it in
his haſte, Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> had Anticipated his
whole Diſcourſe in <hi>p.</hi>

            <p>
               <q rend="inline">'But whether theſe Liturgies were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
and Impos'd as Terms of Communion
this is the Queſtion.' </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this Queſtion the Dr. is not pleas'd
to ſay one Word, as I can obſerve, in his whole
Book, but goes on to prove that to be true
which Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> granted, and lets that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
which he deny'd.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo Ridiculous was this Anſwerer in
the Management of himſelf, both in the
Search of Antiquity, and in rendring thoſe
Authors he Quotes, that a Learned Miniſter
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> meerly with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to Juſtice and Learning, Reply'd to
him, and made it appear that the Doctor did
not ſo much as underſtand the Language of
the Quotations. This was Mr. <hi>Samuel Bold,</hi>
Rector of <hi>Steeples</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I ſuppoſe, is ſome Peoples Way of
Anſwering the Diſſenters; and if this may
paſs for Anſwering, they are Anſwer'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
But I muſt take the Freedom to ſay, It
has yet remain'd unprov'd, that ever a ſtrict
Literal Compliance to any Preſcrib'd Form
of Worſhip and Adminiſtration of Sacraments
was Impos'd as the Term or Condition of
Communion in any Branch of the Chriſtian
Church, for above 400 Years after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0557101200:13"/>
time; nay, 'twould be hard to prove
it ever done in any Church in the World but
ours to this Day; and they are ſtill welcome to
make it out if they can; and till they do, the
World may judge whether the Diſſenters are
<hi>worſted in Argument,</hi> or no.</p>
            <p>That there were Biſhops in the Primitive
Church has alſo been defended with a great
deal of Skill; but as to their Dioceſan Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Juridiction, they have always, in Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
thought fit to let the Diſpute of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
and I would adviſe them to do ſo ſtill,
for they muſt find ſome other Book to defend
it from than the Scripture, and ſome other
Ages of the World to ſearch for the Practice in
than that of the Primitive Church</p>
            <p>But I muſt confeſs the Diſſenters were
worſted another Way, in the Caſe of Dr.
<hi>Calamy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Delaun;</hi> of which remarkable
Story this is the ſhort Abſtract.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr.</hi> Calamy <hi>preaching a Sermon at</hi> Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
<hi>Church, Entituled,</hi> A Diſcourſe about Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Conſciences, <hi>makes the Diſſenters this fair
Challenge, as by his printed Sermon,</hi> P.  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.
<hi>appears in theſe Words:</hi> Could we but prevail
with the People diligently to examine the Merits of
the Cauſe our Church would every Day gain Ground
amongſt all wiſe Men; for we care not how much
Knowledge and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding our People have, ſo they
be but Humble and Modeſt with it: Nor do we deſire
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0557101200:14"/>
Men to become our Proſelites any farther than we
give them Scripture for it. <hi>And in another Place
he goes on;</hi> All we deſire of the Diſſenters is, that
they would equally hear both Sides; that they would
weigh and conſider the Arguments that may be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them; and being indifferent to either Part of the
Queſtion, would think it no Shame to change their Mind
when they ſee good Reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Delaun,</hi> a Man whoſe Learning and
Temper were Conſpicuous to all the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
World, and particularly in the Book he
wrote, accepts this Challenge, and writes
down his Reaſons for Nonconformity; and
as the Doctor had printed his Sermon, and
thereby appeal'd to the World, all Peoples
Mouths were fill'd with the Fairneſs of the
Propoſal, and every Body cry'd out, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
were worſted, Mr. <hi>Delaun</hi> therefore
thought himſelf oblig'd to print his Reply.</p>
            <p>But as the Victory conſiſted, as it does ſtill,
in Boaſts and Rhodomontades, ſo they were
as loth to be overcome, as ſenſible that they
ſhould be ſo, and took immediate Care to
ſuppreſs the Book, by ſeizing the Copy at the
Printer's; and this was follow'd, by ſeizing
the Author for writing a Seditious Libel, put
him in Priſon, fin'd him <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra Tenementum,</hi> and
were hardly prevail'd upon to vouchſafe him
the Favour to excuſe him the Pillory, which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0557101200:15"/>
they at laſt told him in Court was only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in reſpect to his Learning.</p>
            <p>Here was a true Church-Conqueſt; and this
Gentleman was perſecuted with ſo much true
Church Zeal, that he lay in <hi>Newgate</hi> for his
Fine, till he, his Wife and Children, died there,
to the Eternal Scandal both of the Church-man
and the Diſſenters; the one, that he ſhould
firſt challenge a Diſpute, and then ſo baſely
Treat the Man that accepted it; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they ſhould not contribute 75 <hi>l.</hi> to
ſave a Life ſacrific'd for their Defence; and
ſuch a Life, as, for real Merit, deſerv'd infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more Regard in a Nation of Humanity
and Religion, as we fancy our ſelves to be.</p>
            <p>The Book for which this Gentleman was
thus handl'd remains to this Day unanſwer'd
by theſe People, that boaſt ſo much of <hi>worſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Diſſenters,</hi> and they would do well
to look back upon that Book, and make ſome
rational Reply to it before they tell us we can
ſhew no Reaſons for our Diſſenting.</p>
            <p>In like manner they proceed ſtill with the
Diſſenters upon other Points of arguing, as
particularly by <hi>Repealing and Repeating In Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
the Charge of Rebellion and Faction,
whereas they have been over and over Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd
make out their own Loyalty of
Principles or Practice to exceed the Loyalty
of the Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0557101200:16"/>
And <hi>De Foe</hi>'s <hi>Teſt of the Church of</hi> England's
<hi>Loyalty</hi> has receiv'd yet no other Anſwer than
his <hi>Shorteſt Way,</hi> by a Fine <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra Tenement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m,</hi>
and the reproachful Anſwer of <hi>the Pillory.</hi> If
this be your Way of anſwering Arguments,
Gentlemen, 'tis no wonder you can worſt the
Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>To proceed in their uſual Method, a worthy
Member of the Houſe of Commons has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
a Book to vindicate the Occaſional Bill;
and, like thoſe who take Things upon Truſt,
has affirm'd, that all wiſe Nations in the World
have thought it neceſſary to entruſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Publick Affairs in the Hands
of ſuch Perſons only as are of one and the
ſame Perſuaſion in Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>A very handſome Way of calling all the
Chriſtian World Fools: For I defie him to
ſhew me one of thoſe wiſe Nations, and to
prove it by one Inſtance, unleſs where there
has not been any Toleration of other Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
the Turks only Excepted.</p>
            <p>Thus, Gentlemen, we are worſted by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries
and Falſities, not by Arguments; we
are challeng'd to Diſpute, and then ruin'd for
Diſputing; ask'd Queſtions, and then fetch'd
up for Anſwering them. But ſince this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
has found an Adverſary capable to deal
with him, <hi>Power and P—ts excepted,</hi> I leave
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0557101200:17"/>
him to ſay the Diſſenters are worſted, when
he proves it by a ſufficient Reply.</p>
            <p>We are now challeng'd to prove that we
diſſent from the Church in Points ſo far from
being eſſential, as that the Chnrch cannot be
juſtified in Refuſing to abate them; and
we are deſir'd to give in the Objections to the
Convocation.</p>
            <p>What Authority their Author has from the
Convocation to make this Offer, I know not,
and do not ſee how I ſhall know it; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Convocation will receive ſuch a Liſt
of the indifferent things, or no; but ſince
this bold Challenger would be anſwered, and
will not be ſatisfied with a General Reply,
but this muſt be ſpoken to by it ſelf, I crave
leave to accept his Challenge as far as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Particulars reach.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I do affirm this has been done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by the whole Body of the Diſſenting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
in ſuch a Manner, and with ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Reaſons, as ſeveral of the Epiſcopal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
were ſo ſatisfied with, and did ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, that their
Conceſſions were a ſufficient Ground of a U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
VVhat, and who, hindred a Union
when the Diſſenters made ſuch Conceſſions,
I leave to this Gentleman to tell us, if he
cares to expoſe his Friends ſo much.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0557101200:18"/>
Secondly, I do affirm, that if the Church of
<hi>England</hi> would think fit ſo far to ſtoop to
their Diſſenting Brethren, as to abate <hi>ſuch
things only,</hi> and <hi>all ſuch,</hi> as are acknowledg'd by
themſelves to be Indifferent; if it would not
reduce us all to ſuch a perfect Union as to
Comprehend all Parties, it would yet Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
ſo many in the Arms of the Church:
'Twould cauſe ſo many to return to the
Church among the Diſſenters, as would
render the Remainder leſs conſiderable.</p>
            <p>I am to ſuppoſe the Challenger in this
Matter does not expect I ſhould give in ſuch
a Liſt of Alterations as would Reconcile the
Quakers, or perhaps not all other Societies;
or to tell him what Sorts would Conform,
and what would not: But I anſwer him in
Reaſon, if I ſay for my ſelf, that upon ſuch
Conceſſions I would Conform with all my
Heart, and Thouſands more, I believe, would
do the like.</p>
            <p>Since then he has made ſuch an Offer, let
us Examine what it is we deſire of the
Church, what are the Indifferent Things
we differ about, and <hi>I join Iſſue with him</hi> if the
Convocation thinks fit to make theſe Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Amendments, and we refuſe to
Conform, then I am content we ſhall paſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0557101200:19"/>
for a People who are willing to keep open
the Breach to ſerve other Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Before I deſcend to the Particulars, 'tis
neceſſary to make ſome Enquiry into what
I call Indifferent.</p>
            <p>1. I call thoſe Things Indifferent which
are not Eſſential Points of Doctrine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Belief or Practice whereof a Man
cannot obtain Salvation.</p>
            <p>2. All things introduc'd into the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> either in Worſhip or in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
by Humane Inſtitution, which are
not to be found either by Command or by
Preſident in the Holy Scriptures, <hi>which are
the Rule of our Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this Head of Indifferent Things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I join Iſſue with our Author; and if he
thinks fit to preſent our Humble Addreſs to
the Convocation, that they will be pleas'd
to make ſuch Abatement in the Indifferent
Things following, I am perſuaded ſuch
Multitudes of Diſſenters will come into the
Church as may very well deſerve the Name
of a Union, tho' not of an Univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
and the Number of Remaining Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centers
would be much the ſmaller.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0557101200:20"/>
Firſt of all as to Liturgies, we deſire,
ſince it is all Originally Humane, and made
by Men Fallible, and of like Paſſions with our
ſelves, they may ſuffer ſuch Amendment as
are Reaſonable and Juſtifiable from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Practice of the Primitive
Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We deſire that after ſuch Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Miniſter may not in all Caſes be
Ti'd up and Preſcrib'd by the Letter of the
Book, but may have Liberty to Expreſs
himſelf at large in Prayer, as the preſent Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Caſe may require, and his own
Abilities may ſupply.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We deſire the Ordination of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
by Presbyters may be allow'd, being
Juſtifiable by Scripture; and that our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
may be admitted into Holy Orders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Re-ordination, and Impoſing of Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Oaths.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We deſire the Kneeling at the
Sacrament, Bowing at the Name of Jeſus, the
Croſs in Baptiſm, the Uſe of the Surplice,
and all thoſe Things own'd by the Greateſt
Maſters of the Diſpute to be Indifferent, may
either be wholly left out, or ſo left at the
Diſcretion of the People, as that they may
not be impos'd upon them without their
Conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0557101200:21"/>
Fifthly, We deſire the Epiſcopal Hierarchy
to be Reduc'd to ſuch a Pitch of Authority as
may be juſtified by the Scripture, and to no
other; and we are ready to enter into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
with them, what that Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of Power amounts to, and how far it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
            <p>I
do not ſay theſe are all the Heads which
I ſuppoſe the Diſſenters require, but I ſay
theſe are ſome of them, and the moſt Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable;
and if the Church would give ſuch
Conceſſions as were Reaſonable on theſe
Heads, the Controverſie would ſoon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
Whether the Diſſenters Separated from
the Eſtabliſhed Church on frivolous Grounds,
or no.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to Alterations in the Liturgy,
'tis the Avow'd Opinion of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> that no Church in the World is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible;
and above all, our Church does not
pretend to the Title. If then we are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
but ſubject to Err and Miſtake, why
ſhould ſhe refuſe to Enter into the Cauſe,
whether it is convenient to make any farther
or more perfect Reformation or no; but tho'
the Conſideration were not on a farther Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
yet if it were only giving up ſome
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0557101200:22"/>
ſmaller Matter for the ſake of Chriſtian Peace,
it were not Commendable only, but a Due
Requiſite Temper in a Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>As to them that blame the Diſſenters for
Separating, let us enquire of them <hi>if they are
uncapable of greater Light,</hi> and conſequently
of knowing better what they ought to do,
than they did before? If then they will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
this Light, and refuſe to Amend
Things, tho' the Light of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
directs them to it, where lyes the
Charge of Schiſm? Surely not at their Door,
who would only purſue a perfect Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and think it their Duty to ſerve God in the
VVay moſt agreeable to his Revealed VVill
in the Scriptures; but at theirs, who would
oblige them to worſhip him according to the
Inventions of Men, by Forms and Methods,
for which they have neither Warrant, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
of Example, either in the Scripture, or
the Primitive Practice of the Church; I Appeal
to all the World, that as well now as before it is
not our Faults that they bring the Liturgy
upon the Stage of Diſpute, but the bold
Challengers of Men that can never make
good their Arguments: And they ought firſt
to have Anſwered what has been ſaid already,
before they had Challeng'd us to ſhow New
Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0557101200:23"/>
Wherefore in the Senſe firſt of the
Irreſiſtable Force of what has been ſaid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and ſecondly of my Incapacity of ſaying
more to the Purpoſe, at leaſt in ſo ſhort a
time, I make the Propoſers this fair Offer,
and they are at Liberty to carry it to the
Convocation, for 'tis their Buſineſs, not ours.</p>
            <p>1. When they will pleaſe to Anſwer Mr.
<hi>De Laun</hi>'s <hi>Plea for the Non-conformiſts,</hi> and the
Subſtantial, yet Unanſwerable, Reaſons there
given for our Diſſenting.</p>
            <p>2. When they will pleaſe to Reply to the
Conceſſions of the Diſſenters in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and prove they were not
ſufficient Grounds of an Union.</p>
            <p>3. When they will Confute the Scriptural
Authority of Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s <hi>Model of Church-Government,</hi>
which was much the ſame with
the Scheme the Diſſenters preſented to King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and give the Reaſons why
the Biſhops refuſed it, <hi>Baxt. Life,</hi> cap. 8.</p>
            <p>4. If they pleaſe to Reply (<hi>a little more to
the Purpoſe</hi> than Mr. <hi>Osfley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hoadly has
done</hi>) to the Grounds and Reaſons of Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in the 10th Chapter of <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Life,
Abridg'd</hi> by Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> and to ſome yet Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered
Things in Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s <hi>Reply</hi> to
Mr. <hi>Hoadly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0557101200:24"/>
5. If they pleaſe to give a Rational An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the firſt, Second and Third, Vol. of
the <hi>Conformiſts Plea for the Non-conformiſts,</hi> wrote
by a Member of their own Church, and to
<hi>Gilleſpy</hi>'s <hi>View of Engliſh Popiſh Ceremonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenever theſe things are Soberly and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly
Anſwered, and as Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
good Scripture and Reaſon brought for
it, aſſure your ſelf, Sir, when theſe Things
are Anſwered, there ſhall be no manner of
need to bring an Occaſional Bill to prevent
the Alternate Conformity of Diſſenters; 'tis
moſt certain, that the far greater Number of
them will come in, and become your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
United Brethren; and till you do theſe
Things, Gentlemen, we Appeal to all the
World, who are the Cauſers of the Schiſm
you ſpeak of, thoſe that all along offered to
come in upon Reaſonable Conditions, or thoſe
that have perſecuted us for not complying
with Humane Inſtitutions, which are no
where to be found in Scripture, <hi>which is the
only Rule of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus now the World may ſee with
what Truth theſe Gentlemen blacken the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
<hi>with their Repeating Objections, but taking
no notice of Anſwers,</hi> which I here fairly return
upon them, and aſſure them, that whenever
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0557101200:25"/>
they will Anſwer the Objections in Mr. <hi>De
Laun</hi>'s Book againſt the Liturgy and Canon
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and prove the ſame
to be neceſſary from Scripture and Reaſon,
I will certainly Conform, for I believe and
own it my Duty to Conform to them if I can,
and I can never reſiſt Conforming to any thing
which is prov'd to be my Duty from Reaſon
and Scripture.</p>
            <p>I think 'tis needleſs to ſay much of my
own, after ſuch Men as theſe have appear'd
and gone off the Stage with no Reply; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I ſatisfie my ſelf to attempt any
thing by way of Addition to Men of ſuch
exalted Learning, till I can ſee ſomething
New offered upon theſe Heads, and unleſs
theſe Gentlemen have ſomething to ſay more
than has been ſaid before them by Men ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
in Learning to themſelves: What they
now advance ſavours of an Arrogance pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to themſelves, and which I like ſo ill,
that I care not to imitate.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore think it more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
thus to tell them what has been ſaid
already; and if they have any thing to ſay by
way of Reply, that demands an Anſwer,
they may not want what is needful to juſtifie
the Practice and Principles of the Diſſenters,
to be ſuch as neither the Charge of Faction or
Rebellion can be laid at their Doors, and it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0557101200:26"/>
ſeems by this Challenge he would let the
World believe that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
would not ſtand with the Diſſenters for ſmall
Matters; and I cannot but wonder with what
Face he can Publiſh to the World theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Words, which I am perſuaded he has
no Authority for from his Superiors.</p>
            <p>We ſhould have little Quarrel with the Diſſenters
about all the Objections they make as to Habits, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
Liturgy, and even the Grand Point of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
by Presbyters in Caſes of Neceſſity; if it
were not for that Fulſome Word Schiſm, if they did
not gather Separate Congregations, and ſet them up
in Oppoſition to the Church, and ſo form a Schiſm, they
would be no Diſſenters, notwithſtanding their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Sentiments as to the Points before mentioned.
<hi>All theſe are his own Words, P.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou Hypocrite, out of thine own Mouth ſhalt thou
be condemned;</hi> If you had not Quarrell'd
with us about Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgy,
and Ordination, there had been no Schiſm;
no Separate Congregations gathered, no
breaking off from the Church, no ſuch thing
as Diſſenters, at leaſt but few among us; and
to impoſe this upon the World after ſuch
plain Evidence as has been given to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
deſerves a courſer Title than I care to
foul my Paper with, and evidently ſhows the
Method of the Party who run down the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
by Falſities and Forgeries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0557101200:27"/>
And that I may do what theſe People ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
concern themſelves about; I lay it down
as a Truth, that when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
was Reſtor'd to the Crown, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Diſſenters being then deſir'd to Conform
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and their Miniſters
having very good Inducement ſo to do, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Poſſeſſion of their Livings and Benefices,
they were Commanded by the King to give in
their Propoſals upon which they would Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>And
'tis needful to give a ſhort Abſtract of
the Proceedings in that Caſe, in Order to let
the World ſee what occaſion'd the Schiſm
theſe People cry ſo much out of, and to place
the Guilt of it where it really lyes; for as the
Morality, ſo the Immorality, of every Action
conſiſts in the Principle from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
and the End to which it is deſign'd.</p>
            <p>At the Reſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to
put the Diſſenters in Hopes that a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was intended, Ten or Twelve of the
Principal of them were made His Majeſties
Chaplains; and theſe deſigning to improve
that Opportunity, waited upon him, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and humbly
recommended to His Majeſty the Happineſs,
and the Opportunity of a Union among his
Proteſtant Subjects in Matters of Religion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0557101200:28"/>
and begging of him that <hi>ONLY NECESSARY
THINGS might be the Terms of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King declar'd himſelf very favourably
on this Head, profeſs'd that the Propoſal was
exceeding agreeable to him, and promis'd
them to do his utmoſt to bring it to paſs.
Telling them withal, <hi>That this Agreement cou'd
not be expected but by abating ſomething on both Sides,
and meeting one another in the Mid-way; and that
if they were willing to do their Parts, if it was not
effected, it ſhould be their own Faults, and not his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it may very well be obſerv'd that
the Schiſm lyes directly at the Door of the
Church, <hi>if the King's Words are true.</hi> For the
Diſſenters did make Offers of meeting half
Way, and more than half Way, as ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
be made out; and if our Brethren of
the Church can make out one Step offer'd by
them in the moſt indifferent Circumſtance,
then ours is the Schiſm, and not theirs. If
not, <hi>Vae vobis Hypocritae.</hi> Job 15. 6. <hi>Thine own
Mouth condemneth thee, and not I; yea, thine own
Lips teſtifie againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King after this directed, <hi>That they ſhould
bring in Propoſals of the utmoſt they could yield to;</hi>
and they in return beſought His Majeſty,
That <hi>at the ſame time that they offer'd their Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to His Majeſty, the Brethren on the other ſide might
alſo bring in theirs, containing the utmoſt they would
abate and yield to in order to Concord;</hi> and the King
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0557101200:29"/>
promis'd them it ſhould be ſo. <hi>Cal. Ab.</hi> Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
<hi>Life,</hi> p. 144</p>
            <p>According to this Direction of the King
they met and agreed upon a Paper, with a
moſt Humble Addreſs to His Majeſty, they
make Four Preliminary Requeſts to the King,
and then offer'd their Propoſals, an Abſtract of
which you have in Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s <hi>Abridgment</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
<hi>p.</hi> 145. and for the Faithfulneſs of
the Quotation the Reader is referr'd to the
Original, which is to be ſeen in Print.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They requeſt, <hi>That ſerious Godlineſs might
be countenanced; a Learned and Pious Miniſter in each
Pariſh encouraged; that a Perſonal, Publick, owning
the Baptiſmal Covenant might precede an Admiſſion
to the Lord's Table; and that the Lord's Day might
be ſtrictly ſanctified.</hi> They offer to allow of the
true, ancient, Primitive Precedency in the
Church, with a due Mixture of Presbyters,
in order to the avoiding the Corruptions,
Partiality, Tyranny, and other Evils, which
are incident to the Adminiſtration of a ſingle
Perſon; the Things which they principally
blamed in the <hi>Engliſh Frame</hi> were the <hi>great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Biſhops Dioceſs: Their deputing Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Chancellors, and Officials, to act in their Stead:
Their aſſuming their ſole Power of Ordination and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
and acting ſo arbitrarily in Viſitation Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;</hi>
bringing in new Ceremonies, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending
Miniſters at Pleaſure: And for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0557101200:30"/>
theſe Evils, they propoſed, that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
Uſher's <hi>Reduction of Epiſcopacy unto the Form
of Synodical Government received in the ancient Church</hi>
ſhould be the Ground-work of an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
and that Suffragans ſhould be choſen
by the reſpective Synods: The Aſſociations
be of a moderate Extent; the Miniſters to be
under no Oaths, or Promiſes of Obedience to
the Biſhops, as being reſponſible for any
Tranſgreſſion of the Law; and that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
govern not by Will and Pleaſure, but
according to Rules, Canons and Conſtitutions,
that ſhould be ratified and eſtabliſh'd by Act
of Parliament. As to the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> they own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Lawfulneſs of a preſcribed Form of
Publick Worſhip, but deſired that ſome Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Pious, and Moderate Divines of both
ſorts might be employed either to compile a
new <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or to reform the old, adding ſome
other varying Forms in Scripture Phraſe, to
be uſed at the Miniſter's Choice. As to the
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> they humbly repreſented, that the
Worſhip of God was perfect without them;
that God hath declared himſelf in Matters of
Worſhip a jealous God; that the Reformed
Churches abroad, moſt of them rejected the
Ceremonies that were reclaimed here; that
here in <hi>England</hi> they had ever ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
been Matters of Contention and
Diſpute; that they had occaſioned the ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0557101200:31"/>
of many Pious and Uſeful Miniſters,
and given Riſe to many Separations from the
Church: That they were at beſt but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and in there own Nature mutable;
and therefore they begg'd that kneeling at the
Sacrament might not be impoſed, and that the
Surplice and the Croſs in Baptiſm, and the
bowing at the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> rather than
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Emanuel,</hi> might be aboliſhed, and
that Care might be taken to prevent future
Innovations, contrary to Law; that ſo the
Publick Worſhip might be free, not only
from Blame, but Suſpicion.</p>
            <p>Does this look like a Propoſal from Men
that did not diſſent, but upon Factious and
Politick Principles? 'Tis hard there ſhou'd
be any Occaſion to revive the Diſcourſe of
theſe Things at a Time when we wiſh for that
<hi>Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> which Her Majeſty has ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
invited us to. But theſe Men of Storms
and Heat, who are wilfully ignorant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
are willing other Men ſhould be blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo; and therefore 'tis neceſſary a little to
refreſh their Memory, and to ſhew to the
World that this Schiſm and Separation of the
Diſſenters was wholly occaſion'd by the
Church refuſing to give up indifferent Things,
and impoſing thoſe indifferent Things as
Terms of Communion upon the Conſciences
of all the People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0557101200:32"/>
               <hi>The King upon the Miniſters delivering in
the Propoſals and Addreſs</hi> Treated them very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully,
<hi>ſays the ſame Author,</hi> renew'd his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
of his earneſt Deſires of an Accommodation of
the Differences; told them he was well pleas'd that
they agreed to a Liturgy, and yielded to the Eſſence
of Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>Here is an Acknowledgment from the
Head of the Church, that the Diſſenters were
for an Accommodation, agreed to a Liturgy,
and to the Eſſence of Epiſcopacy, and yet our
Modern Men of Peace will throw all the
Breach upon the Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>Now, Gentlemen, let us examine your
Chriſtian High-Church Temper theſe yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
complying, Diſſenters met with, that
we may ſee whether they were out, or were
driven out from the Church.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters that were to be <hi>for Yet they
were not ſo</hi> expected, according to their Requeſt,
and His Majeſty's Promiſe, to be met with by
the Divines on the other Side, and to ſee their
Propoſals, but none appear'd; and after long
expecting their Condeſcentions and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
at laſt they receiv'd a Satyrical Anſwer
by way of Reflection to their Propoſals, but
not one Word of Condeſcention and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0557101200:33"/>
               <q>'As to <hi>Church-Covernment,</hi> they declare for the
former Hierarchy without any Alteration;
and inviduouſly inſinuate, that their Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on the Conſequences of a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's
Adminiſtration in the Church, was as
applicable to the Civil State. The <hi>Extent of
Dioceſſes</hi> they declare ſuitable enough to the
Biſhops Office; and the <hi>Adminiſtration of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Juriſdiction by Chancellors,</hi> &amp;c. Regular in
the Main. Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s <hi>Reduction</hi> they reject as
inconſiſtent with Two other of his Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as being at beſt but a heap of Private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
The <hi>Liturgy</hi> they applaud as unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable,
and think it can't be ſaid to be
too Rigorouſly impoſed, when Miniſters are
not denied the Exerciſe of their Gifts, in
Praying before and after Sermon; which Sort
of Praying, they declare however, is but the
continuance of a Cuſtom of no great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and grown into Common uſe by Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
only, without any other Foundation
in the Laws and Canons. The Reviſing the
<hi>Liturgy</hi> nevertheleſs they yield to, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
thinks fit. As for the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> they
could not part with one; not being able to
think that the Satisfaction of ſome Private
Perſons was to be laid in Ballance againſt the
Publick Peace, and Uniformity of the
Church. Nay, were any Abatements made,
they are ſatisfied unquiet Spirits would be

            <p>
               <hi>Ecce

Diſſenters Schiſm in Three Heads.</p>
            <p>Epiſcopal Hierarchy without Alteration.</p>
            <p>Liturgy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexceptionable, and impoſſible to be too
Rigorouſly Impos'd.</p>
            <p>Ceremonies, not one to be parted with.</p>
            <p>Pray, Gentlemen, how long have ye alter'd
your Minds, that you can now ſay <hi>you won't
quarrel with us for Habits, Ceremonies, or Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and when we offer'd to agree with you
in every thing elſe, you would have <hi>your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
without Alteration,</hi> you would not part
with <hi>one of the Ceremonies;</hi> and thought <hi>your Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexceptionable, and that it cou'd not be too Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
Impoſed?</hi> How long is it ſince theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
have been of a better Opinion? And
when all is done, how ſhall we be ſure their
Propoſal is Genuine, while we have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
ſo much Falſity and ill-grounded Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
as before?</p>
            <p>Here now is the Picture of a High-Church
Challenge, to which we may very well An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
we are the ſame that we were when we
made the Propoſals to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and we have a great deal of Reaſon to
believe you are the ſame too. <hi>Ill Nature ſeldom
turns Changling.</hi> 'Tis true, you did promiſe us
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0557101200:35"/>
fine things, you promiſed to come to a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with the Diſſenters, and declar'd 'twas
your Principle to give an Eaſe to Conſciences
truly Scrupulous; and upon this Foot you
obtain'd upon us to join with you in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution:
Now you talk of Honeſty, pray,
Gentlemen, do us the Favour to let us know
in what you ever perform'd that Promiſe, and
when we are to expect it?</p>
            <p>Now you ſhall be put to Trial of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
and Juſtice, what Commiſſion you had
from the Convocation to tell us you would
not Differ about <hi>Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgy</hi> and
<hi>Ordination,</hi> I know not, and believe you will
be puzzled to produce it: But I venture to ſay
to you from abundance of the Diſſenters, <hi>that
then you ſhall differ with us for nothing;</hi> Remit
us theſe and we will Conform to you, and
be all One Church and One People.</p>
            <p>'Tis about theſe Things Chiefly you Differ
with us; you have no Pretences but theſe
upon us: The Articles of Rebellion Forty
One; the <hi>Rye-Houſe</hi> Plot, <hi>Caſtares</hi>'s Evidences,
and more: We can allow you all theſe, and
many more than is true, and yet prove that
your Principles are as Diſloyal, and your
Practices have been as full of Rebellion, as
ours; you have made as many Inſurrections
againſt the Eſtabliſh'd Governors of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as we; you have made as many Factions
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0557101200:36"/>
againſt the Princes and the Laws, took up
Arms as often, kill'd as many Kings, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
it, as we; and how often have you
been Challeng'd to come to a Teſt of your
Loyalty with us? But you are Proof againſt
Argument; and without taking notice of
theſe things, or of any thing elſe that ſtands
againſt you, you <hi>Repeat and Repeat</hi> your
Railings, and ſuffer your Tongues to Launch
out in a ſenſleſs and inſignificant manner,
<hi>In Inſinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to help load the Diſſenters with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
you Charge them with all that has been
done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Arbitrary Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of State Miniſters oftentimes made the
People Deſperate: No wonder if from ſuch
Principles you can Charge them with Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the City of <hi>London.</hi> One would think
theſe Gentlemens Paſſions ſhould not make
them forget their Reaſon ſo much as to expoſe
their Proceedings to their own Friends.</p>
            <p>Did not the Committee of Parliament fix
the Firing of the City upon the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi>
by the irreſiſtable Teſtimony of the
Perſons concern'd; and why muſt the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do it? Had you brought them by Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
to ſuch deſperate Fortunes, to ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
as to ſet Fire to their own Houſes?
Were there not almoſt as many of them Burnt
out as of the Church?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0557101200:37"/>
The ridiculous Fury of theſe Men is an
Anſwer to themſelves; and upon the whole, I
offer to make out, That the Diſſenters have, on
all Occaſions, behav'd themſelves with as much
Zeal for the Government, as much Sincerity
to the Soveraign, and as much Loyalty, as the
Church has done, let them begin the Debate
when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, I'll prove, That the High
Church Party has tyranniz'd over them by all
the Illegal, Unchriſtian, Methods poſſible, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to drive them to the Extremities
of Deſpair and Rebellion.</p>
            <p>I'll prove by the Preachings, Printings, and
declar'd Judgment, of ſeveral of the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
High, Party, that however the Practice
was diſown'd by the Party, upon the unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
expoſing it, by the Book, call'd, <hi>The Shorteſt
Way;</hi> yet that it has all along been their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
and very often in their Deſign; and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
for the Truth of it, among many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to a Letter of a known Church-man,
whoſe Original I have by me, being wrote
to a Perſon who ſent him the Book for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>I
Received yours, and encloſed the Book, call'd, <hi>The
Shorteſt Way with the Diſſenters,</hi> for
which I thank you; and, next to the Holy Bible, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0557101200:38"/>
Sacred Comments, I place it as the most Valuable Thing
I can have. I look upon it as the only Method, and
I pray God to put it into the Heart of our most Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Queen to put what is there propos'd in Execution.</p>
            <p>Here is the Character of a High-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
drawn to the Life; but when in a Poſt
or Two this Gentleman underſtood it was
wrote by a Diſſenter, in his next he ſends up
an Invidious Character of a Whig, and what
in his Opinion ſuch a one deſerv'd.</p>
            <p>And now, Gentlemen, would Reaſon and
Arguments ſerve for a Reply to you, I ſhould
go on with your voluminous Rapſody of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal;
but really it is ſo full of Rudeneſs, and
Want of Manners, as well as Want of Truth,
that I chuſe to let it go, and return to your
Challenge about our Conformity; and this
you direct us to lay before the Convocation,
which I cannot but make ſome juſt Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to.</p>
            <p>1. I ſee no Reaſon to believe the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
has given you any Authority to make
the Propoſal; I cannot but believe that the
Convocation knows too well what, and how
often, the Diſſenters have offer'd the very
Thing theſe Gentlemen propoſe; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
cannot be ignorant that all Propoſals
of Amendment and Abatement are Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Diſagreeable to the Temper of theſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0557101200:39"/>
High-Churchmen; and the Convocation could
not be guilty of ſo much Imprudence to offer
that to us now, which we have ſo often offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to no Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>2. I ſee no Reaſon to believe the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will perform the Conditions theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
propoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to abate the Habits, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
Liturgies, and Ordination; and
therefore, Gentlemen, you are deſired to take
back your own Words with this fair Propoſal.</p>
            <p>Whenever the Church of <hi>England</hi> ceaſes to
quarrel with us about Habits, Ceremonies, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,
and Ordination, we are content that
thoſe Diſſenters which ſhall after that refuſe
to Conform, may be taxed with being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have the Breach healed, with being
obſtinate Diſſenters, or what you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis an unaccountable Aſſurance in any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to advance ſuch a Notion to the World;
in which, had they Power but of Reflection
on themſelves, they muſt of Neceſſity ſee
they were in the Wrong.</p>
            <p>Pray, Gentlemen, what do you think we
differ with you for? We hope you are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;
we have own'd you a true Church, and
that we differ from you in nothing Doctrinal,
or abſolutely Neceſſary for Salvation? Will
ye keep your Words with us? Then here is
your Challenge anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0557101200:40"/>
Get the Convocation to paſs it into an Act,
that the Church will not quarrel with us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgies and Ordination,</hi>
the Schiſm be upon us if we do not Conform.</p>
            <p>If you can't do this, then make us no more
Challenges, never write to us to tell you upon
what Terms we will Conform; we are ready
to Conform upon your own Terms; we take
you at your own Words; do but perform what
you have voluntarily propos'd, we are your
own.</p>
            <p>Not but that we have great Reaſon to ſay,
we know very well that this Offer is neither
in your Power, nor in your Nature; not in
your Power, as private Men; not in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of your High Church, as a Party.</p>
            <p>Nor is it any Breach of Charity to ſay ſo,
becauſe we have had ſo much Experience of
your Temper on all Occaſions in this Matter;
and in particular, in the Conferences at the
<hi>Savoy,</hi> where the Diſſenters made all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
of Charity and Obedience that they
were able to do with any Safety to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
they went through the Common-Prayer-Book,
and propos'd only ſuch Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as they found abſolutely neceſſary to
make it tolerable to them and their Hearers;
they offer'd to diſpute upon the Amendments
they had made, and to juſtifie all their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0557101200:41"/>
In a Word, they offer'd to Conform ſo far
as they were able to anſwer it to God, their
Conſciences, and the World; and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
Men to offer more, or elſe rejects them,
and ſhuts them out of their Communion,
wou'd do well to tell us who are the Authors
of the Schiſm.</p>
            <p>But after all, theſe Gentlemen, by what I
can perceive, are as ignorant in the thing they
call Schiſm, as they ſeem to be in other Things;
and we have the Teſtimony of the Houſe of
Lords, in which there concurr'd moſt of the
Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
are not Schiſmaticks.</hi> See the Reaſons of
the Lords againſt the Bill to prevent <hi>Occaſional
Conformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And had theſe Gentlemen bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
when they charge us with this Schiſm,
for ſeparating from the Church, they would
have reflected a little on Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> of <hi>Eaton,</hi>
a Sober and Judicious Divine of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> who in his Treatiſe of Schiſm lets
them know, that ſeparating in Communion
from any Particular Church is not a Schiſm,
if the Perſons are not ſeparated from the whole
Body of Chriſtians; but he that holds the
Head, holds faſt the Faith, and does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
in Faith and Doctrine, cannot be ſaid to
be guilty of Schiſm for his refuſing to join in
Communion with this or that Particular
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0557101200:42"/>
Church. The Church of Chriſt is that whole
Body of Chriſtians, however diſpers'd all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the World, who are united to him by
Faith, and are the Members compoſing and
join'd to his Myſtical Body, profeſſing the
ſame Doctrine and Faith, tho' divided into
never ſo many ſeveral Communities, Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and other Parts.</p>
            <p>If this be to be Schiſmaticks, 'tis plain the
Diſſenters are not no Schiſmaticks; and thus we
have the Teſtimony of the Church Miniſters,
we have the Vote of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
Biſhops, and a Majority of the Houſe of Peers,
that the Diſſenters are no Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſhall we ſay now?</hi> If the Diſſenters are
allow'd by the Church not to be Schiſmaticks;
and if the Houſe of Lords concur in the Vote;
and if you will not will not quarrel with us for Habit,
Ceremonies, Liturgy or Ordination; <hi>Pray let
theſe Authors tell us what is the Difference among us?</hi>
The People may ſoon be united, for here is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
left to diſpute of.</p>
            <p>What then is it we are treated for in ſuch
a Scandalous Manner? For what is it we are
call'd by Sir <hi>H. M.</hi> a People unſafe to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with any Part of the Adminiſtration? In
what are we dangerous to the Government?
In what is it unſafe to truſt us? Why, <hi>Ye are
Enemies to Monarchy,</hi> and always plotting
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0557101200:43"/>
againſt the Government, ſays theſe Learned
and Paſſionate Authors.</p>
            <p>Say you ſo, Sirs? We will come to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Plots againſt Monarchy and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when you will; and whenever we do,
you will be found guilty of more than we.</p>
            <p>But you have given us a long Liſt of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Plots, as you call them, and of People exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for them. Firſt of all, I believe 'twould
be hard to prove the Diſſenters were in a Plot
every time ſome of them were hang'd for it:
And we have ſeen ſome Church of <hi>England</hi>
Parliaments <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhang them again,</hi> as far as they
could, to do Juſtice to their Poſterity: But I
ſhall not ravel into the Liſt of Diſſenters Plots
at this time; only I cannot avoid telling this
Author that he has not given a fair Account
of them; the Diſſenters, Sir, have been guilty
of more Plots againſt the Government than
you charge them with, and more have been
executed for it than you tell us of; for I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you the Author of this wears a Mourning
Ring on his Finger, given at the Funeral of
Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Love,</hi> a Presbyterian Miniſter,
Beheaded <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. for the horrid Phanatick
Plot, contriv'd for the bringing in, <hi>as they then
call'd him, Charles Stuart,</hi> and the reſtoring of
Monarchy.</p>
            <p>And now we come to examine a little this
Author's prepoſterous Motion, that we ſhould
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0557101200:44"/>
give in our Grievances to the Convocation.
Why truly, Gentlemen, we have Grievances
which the Convocation might redreſs, but
we don't expect they will; and ſome of them
are as follow.</p>
            <p>I. 'Tis our Grievance to be falſly accus'd,
as Miſmanagers of the late Reign, when we
had little or nothing to do in it; as unſafe to
the Government, when we have all along en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to uphold it; as Enemies to Peace,
when we challenge all our Enemies to teſtifie
who has the greateſt Zeal for the Publick
Concord, the Diſſenters, or the Church.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis our Grievance to be challeng'd to
ſhow on what Terms we can Conform, and
large Conceſſions offer'd us in the Name of
the Convocation by Men who are ſo far
from having any Authority from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
that the Gentlemen of that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
do not think it worth while to own what
they ſay, or perform what they promiſe, in
their Names, as it certainly is in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>3. It is a Grievance to us, and to the whole
Nation, that we ſhould at firſt, to gratifie a
Party, and to fortifie the State Policy of Trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Deſigning Men, be driven out, and caſt
off, from the Church-Communion, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Fellow-Chriſtians, for Trifles, and
Things Indifferent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0557101200:45"/>
Perhaps I am not of ſo free an Opinion
as to the Indifferency of all the Things in
which we Differ as the Church themſelves;
but they are allow'd by the Church them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be Indifferent, and they are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
Indifferent in the Senſe of Indifferency
explain'd as before; and therefore, <hi>ad hominem,</hi>
they are really Indifferent: Even the whole
of Church Diſcipline is ſo far Indifferent,
that whether this or that Model be ſettled,
either Party are allow'd to be capable of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
without prejudice to their Belief in
that Head; or to ſpeak plain, a Man may
go to heaven in the Practice of either of
them, but yet as Conſcience directs, ought
to have Liberty to Chuſe for himſelf.</p>
            <p>But to be caſt out of Chriſtian Communion
for Trifles, <hi>for ſuch are all the Indifferent Things
compar'd to the more Eſſential Points of Religion,</hi>
this is a Grievance; and this is indeed the
Original Grievance, and the firſt Cauſe of
all their Speparation, which our Author calls
Schiſm, to impoſe what they own the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
does not impoſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis my Opinion, generally ſpeaking, that
no Church can juſtifie keeping out any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
from their Communion for any thing
that will not in its own Nature and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
keep him out of Heaven: To keep
us out of the Communion of the Church for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0557101200:46"/>
things which you own we may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
will find but ſlender Authority in the
Scripture to Juſtifie.</p>
            <p>But after all, ſuppoſe our Grievances
were laid before the Convocation, will this
Author aſſure us of Relief this Way? Will
he undertake to tell us any thing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
has done that Way for any Body?
Nay, will he be pleaſed to tell us, whether
that Body, who have now Set above Fifteen
Years Annually, have done one Act or Thing
for the Benefit of the Church they Repreſent?
Will he pleaſe to give the World a Hiſtory of
their Actions, and engage to make out they
have done any thing but Wrangle among
themſelves for ſo long time? Theſe Men of
Uniformity, have they had any Uniform
Proceedings? <hi>Have they, in ſhort,</hi> done any
thing worthy of themſelves, or the Church
they Repreſent? If they have, we would be
glad to hear it; if they have not, to what
Purpoſe ſhould we apply to them for the Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Breaches.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, let us ask him another Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Do the Convocation agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
Have not ſome Gentlemen fill'd the
World with Volumes and learned Tracts on
little Matters, relating to Adjournings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
of that Aſſembly; and that one Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſeems not yet Maſter'd, and how can we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0557101200:47"/>
expect that Spirit of Candor, that Temper
and Peaceable Mind, which is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to bring to paſs ſo great a Bleſſing as
this of a Proteſtant Union? How can we
look for it from an Aſſembly that cannot
Decide their own Controverſies, nor Heal
their own Breaches.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it ſeems to me this Man
of Gall has overſhot himſelf, has gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his Commiſſion, and has made a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
he had no Authority for, and promiſed for
People that will not perform for him.</p>
            <p>Wherefore upon the whole Matter, as we
have ſmall Reaſon to hope for a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Principles, I think the preſent Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Nation is to arrive at a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Parties, a Conjunction of Intereſts,
a General Union of Affection, where there
cannot be a Union of Opinions; that the
Strife of Parties and Factions may ceaſe, and
that Clamour and Contention may be at an
end.</p>
            <p>Could this be brought to paſs, it would
really be the greateſt Step towards Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in Religious Matters.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This would make our Charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive,
and we ſhould not make it our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
buſineſs to Accuſe, but Excuſe, One
Another; Reproachful Terms and Marks of
Diſtinction would die of courſe; Proteſtant
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0557101200:48"/>
would be the Common Name of all Opinions.</p>
            <p>God be prais'd, we are all of One Religion
in <hi>England,</hi> tho' we Differ about Methods:
We pretend to be all Travelling to Heaven,
tho' we fall out by the Way; and we fall
out about the Way too: But if every man
diſturb'd himſelf leſs about the Courſe his
Neighbour Steers, and concern'd himſelf more
about his own, there would more find the
right Way thither, <hi>as far as Humane Conduct
is concern'd in the Voyage to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> they are
Miſrepreſented to the Nation, that they are for
Tumults and Rebellions, Inſurrections, and
pulling down Monarchy, and Governments;
enough has been ſaid here and elſewhere to
Invite the Accuſers to a fair Debate; but the
preſent Caſe chiefly reſpects their Intereſt.
They are not a Small, nor a Poor Sort in the
Nation: The old Proverb of, Intreſt won't
lye, is on their ſide; <hi>Men of Eſtates are never for
pulling down Houſes, Burning Towns, and Ruining
Nations;</hi> 'tis Natural for Trading Men to be
Wiſe for themſelves; 'tis Men of Deſperate
Fortunes are for Embroiling Kingdoms, and
ſetting States and Governments into a Flame.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are the Men of Trade and Induſtry; and
what Eſtates they have, lye principally in
Stock of Goods, Houſes, and Credit. No
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0557101200:49"/>
Publick Diſaſter can befal the Nation, but
what affects their Eſtates more than other
Mens; Banks Stocks, Trade Foreign and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick,
Theſe are the firſt Things that ſuffer
on any Publick Diſorder; and none of thoſe
People who are thus Embark'd in Trade, can
be properly thought to deſire Diſaſters and
Revolutions, becauſe they are generally the
firſt that feel it.</p>
            <p>There may indeed be ſome Men among
them that want Principles, and may Act ill,
but theſe are few, and not Remarkable; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the Diſſenters muſt be blind to
their own Intereſts, as well as Enemies to the
Government and their Neighbours, when
they promote Factions and Diviſions in the
State.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to obſerve in this Caſe
what I Appeal to any Man's Judgment in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
my own, in the particular Article of
Stocks in the City, when the People are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
at any Publick Matters, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Affairs looks with an ill Aſpect,
<hi>the Stocks fall;</hi> again, on the contrary, when
they are eaſie, the Stocks riſe, and the Stock-Jobbers
frequently Manage ſuch Occaſions;
and on this Head 'tis obſerv'd, That in the Caſe
of a certain Bill depending in the Houſe,
when the People thought it would be paſs'd,
Stocks fell; again, when the talk of it began
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0557101200:50"/>
to be laid aſide, <hi>as it really was for ſome time,</hi>
all Stocks roſe in Price; and when it came
to a Period, they ſtill advanc'd again.</p>
            <p>Not that I Argue from hence that the
Diſſenters are the Chief Parties Intereſſed in
the Stocks, for 'tis plain they are not; but from
hence may be ſeen by any Man who does
not put out his own Eyes, the great Benefit
of Peace and Union, the Effect it has on
Trade, Credit, and the Value of Eſtates.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Author of this Book diſcovers
a Spirit of too much Rancor and Malice, to
make it fit to talk with him. I am told he
is not an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man; and indeed he ſeems
not to be an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, by his furious way
of Treating the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation at a time when
they are all inclin'd to peace with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the leaſt thing can be ſaid of him in
this Caſe is, that he diſcovers Impotent Rage
at a People, who, God be prais'd, are out of
his Reach; and the Remnant of his Railing
Talent may lye either againſt the Lords who
have rejected the <hi>Occaſional Bill,</hi> on whom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, he will plentifully beſtow the
uſual Titles of a Faction, a Party, Low-Church
Men, and the like.</p>
            <p>Or elſe he may give himſelf a Looſe at the
Queen, who ſeveral of his Habit, <hi>for we
underſtand he is a Brother of the Gown,</hi> have
left off to pray for, except at Church, where
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0557101200:51"/>
they cannot help it; and as Mr.—of
<hi>High-Wickham</hi> has entirely left Her Majeſty
out of his Grace after Meat, ever ſince Her
Speech to the Houſes of Parliament for Peace
and Union; ſo theſe Gentlemen may be
expected with him to give Her Majeſty a Caſt
of their Foul Language as ſoon as they dare
do it.</p>
            <p>But one Word with this Gentleman, and
then I conclude, and that is about Plotting,
for the Diſſenters have been his Plotters and
his Rebels all along, and have on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
been very roughly handled by him, as to
Aſſociations, Treaſons, Rebellions, and the
like.</p>
            <p>Now I would fain deſire this Gentleman to
tell us a little News about a Plot in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
Her Majeſty has given Her Parliament an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that She has Unqueſtion'd Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Plot in <hi>Scotland;</hi> for our parts we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
it from the Malignancy of the Party
there; but now a Declaration of its Unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd
reality from the Throne, has put the
Matter of Fact out of Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Now as this Gentleman keeps a very good
Correſpondence there, which appears by his
own Writing, I could moſt earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to him to inform the World how many
Diſſenters, or Presbyterians, there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0557101200:52"/>
Without doubt he can make it appear there
are <hi>no High-Churchmen in it;</hi> for they, Good Men,
are of ſuch untainted Principles, as to Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they are ſo true to the Doctrine of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Obedience, and Non-Reſiſtance, that 'tis
impoſſible they can ever be concern'd in any
ſuch thing; no, no, it muſt all go upon the
poor Papiſts; thoſe Roman Catholicks are ſad
Fellows; they are always plotting, and theſe
Whigs and Diſſenters they muſt have a Hand
in it; juſt as this Author ſays they had
in the Fire of <hi>London;</hi> the Diſſenters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
very eager to ſet the Nation in a Flame,
when they ſet Fire to their own Houſes to
begin it.</p>
            <p>But alas for us! What ſhall we ſay now, if
it may be prov'd that here are a great many
High-flying Churchmen in this Plot? Then
<hi>the Wolf will be ſtript indeed.</hi> What if here ſhould
be <hi>Depos'd Biſhops, Non-Jurant Parſons,</hi> and <hi>High-Church
Epiſcoparian Scots-men,</hi> in this Plot againſt
the Queen and Her Goverment? What
ſhall we ſay then? Why, I'll tell you what
they will ſay; they'll ſay that Presbyterian
Tyranny has drove them to ſuch Extremities,
that Fleſh and Blood could bear no longer.
To which I ſhall anſwer, Not at all, granting
the Truth of Fact, that juſt as much had the
Rebels at—and <hi>Bothwell-Bridge,</hi> to
ſay, That Epiſcopal, Prelatick, Tyranny drove
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0557101200:53"/>
them to ſuch Extremities, that Fleſh and
Blood could bear no longer.</p>
            <p>From whence I draw this ſhort Inference,
That whether they are Churchmen or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
one Religion or another; when Men
think themſelves oppreſs'd, let their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Pretence be what they will, they
will always forget thoſe Pretences; Nature
will prevail; they will attempt their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and ſeek by Force to reſiſt Force.</p>
            <p>Church of <hi>England,</hi> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Church of <hi>France,</hi> any Church in
the World,
<q>Whene'er they are Oppreſs'd, they will Rebel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But one thing, we muſt tell theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
they differ from their Brother Rebels in;
that they have plotted and rebell'd with half
the Oppreſſions and Tyranny as others have
done before them.</p>
            <p>And if ever theſe Gentlemen pleaſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the <hi>Sad and Doleful Sufferings</hi> of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Diſſenters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of <hi>which they have
made ſo much Noiſe,</hi> with the Miſeries, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Plunders, and Barbarous Uſage of the
Diſſenters in <hi>Scotland</hi> for 30 Years before, it
will be eaſily ſeen which had the moſt
Cauſe to cry out of, <hi>Fleſh and Blood being able to
bear no longer;</hi> and whenever they pleaſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0557101200:54"/>
into the Detail of theſe Things, we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to join Iſſue with them on this Head.</p>
            <p>The Author or Authors of this Wolfiſh
Book would have done well to have taken
Advice from a Gentleman of their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and who writes on the ſame Subject, who
has ſaid much more to the Purpoſe, and in
Language much more ſuitable to common
Civility, and good Manners; I mean the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of a Book, Entituled, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to the Church of</hi>
England <hi>Freely Offer'd, and Earnestly Recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to the Diſſenters from it, of all Perſwaſions; but
particularly to the Occaſional Conformiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now tho' I am of the Opinion that the
Arguments that Gentleman makes uſe of may
be anſwer'd, yet I muſt acknowledge to his
Honour, that while on the one Hand he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
himſelf to be of High-Church Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
yet he ſhew himſelf a Man of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
a Scholar, and a Gentleman; and if ever
he is replied to, ought to be treated according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
the Candor with which he treats the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he writes againſt, at leaſt deſerves this
Acknowledgment, that he is the firſt of that
Side that has uſed them civilly, and is thereby
juſt ſo much the harder to be confuted, for
railing is much larger anſwer'd than Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I leave Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> and to anſwer
thoſe Parts of the Scurrilous Invectives rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0557101200:55"/>
to them, which 'tis not ſo much a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether they can, as whether 'tis worth
while for them, or any Body elſe, to reply to
ſo much Railery.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed had this been wrote, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
to the World how willing the Diſſenters
are at all times to enter into the Merits of the
Cauſe, to let the World ſee the Reaſons of
their Diſſent, and how willing they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch Conceſſions as Reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
calls for to come to a general Union
with their Proteſtant Brethren, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the Miſrepreſentation of High-Church
Malice to the contrary.</p>
