            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE fine arts have ever been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by wiſe princes, not ſingly for private amuſement, but for their beneficial influence in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. By uniting different ranks in the ſame elegant pleaſures, they promote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence: by cheriſhing love of order, they inforce ſubmiſſion to government: and by inſpiring delicacy of feeling, they make regular government a double bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0258100201:3"/>
THESE conſiderations embolden me to hope for your Majeſty's patronage in behalf of the following work, which treats of the fine arts, and attempts to form a ſtandard of taſte by unfolding thoſe principles that ought to govern the taſte of every individual.</p>
            <p>IT is rare to find one born with ſuch delicacy of feeling, as not to need inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is equally rare to find one ſo low in feeling, as not to be capable of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet, to refine our taſte with reſpect to beauties of art or of nature, is ſcarce endeavoured in any ſeminary of learning; a lamentable defect, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how early in life taſte is ſuſceptible of culture, and how difficult to reform it if unhappily perverted. To furniſh mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for ſupplying that defect, was an additional motive for the preſent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0258100201:4"/>
TO promote the fine arts in Britain, has become of greater importance than is generally imagined. A flouriſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce begets opulence; and opulence, inflaming our appetite for pleaſure, is commonly vented on luxury and on every ſenſual gratification: Selfiſhneſs rears its head; becomes faſhionable; and infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ranks, extinguiſhes the <hi>amor patriae</hi> and every ſpark of public ſpirit. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or to retard ſuch fatal corruption, the genius of an Alfred cannot deviſe any means more efficacious, than venting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulence upon the fine arts. Riches ſo employ'd, inſtead of encouraging vice, will excite both public and private vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Of this happy effect, ancient Greece furniſhes one ſhining inſtance; and why ſhould we deſpair of another in Britain?</p>
            <p>IN the commencement of an auſpicious reign, and even in that early period of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0258100201:5"/>
life when pleaſure commonly is the ſole purſuit, your Majeſty has uniformly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd to a delighted people, the nobleſt principles, ripened by early culture; and for that reaſon, you will be the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to favour every rational plan for advancing the art of training up youth. Among the many branches of education, that which tends to make deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of virtue, ought to be a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental meaſure in a well-regulated go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: for depravity of manners will render ineffectual the moſt ſalutary laws; and in the midſt of opulence, what other means to prevent ſuch depravity but early and virtuous diſcipline? The Britiſh diſcipline is ſuſceptible of great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and if we can hope for them, it muſt be from a young and accompliſhed Prince, eminently ſenſible of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. To eſtabliſh a complete ſyſtem of education, ſeems reſerved by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for a Sovereign who commands
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0258100201:6"/>
the hearts of his ſubjects. Succeſs will crown the undertaking, and endear GEORGE THE THIRD to our lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>THE moſt elevated and moſt refined pleaſure of human nature, is enjoy'd by a virtuous prince governing a virtuous people; and that, by perfecting the great ſyſtem of education, your Majeſty may very long enjoy this pleaſure, is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſh of </p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE five ſenſes agree in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular, that nothing external is perceived till it firſt make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the organ of ſenſe; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for example, made upon the hand by a ſtone, upon the palate by ſugar, and upon the noſtrils by a roſe. But there is a difference as to our conſciouſneſs of that impreſſion. In touching, taſting, and ſmelling, we are conſcious of the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Not ſo in ſeeing and hearing. When I behold a tree, I am not ſenſible of the impreſſion made upon my eye; nor of the impreſſion made upon my ear, when I liſten to a ſong<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Appendix, § 13.</note>. This difference in the manner of perception, diſtinguiſhes remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hearing and ſeeing from the other ſenſes; and diſtinguiſhes ſtill more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the feelings of the former from thoſe of the latter. A feeling pleaſant or painful cannot exiſt but in the mind; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0258100201:10"/>
in taſting, touching, and ſmelling, we are conſcious of the impreſſion made upon the organ, we naturally place there alſo, the pleaſant or painful feeling cauſed by that impreſſion. And becauſe ſuch feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſeem to be placed externally at the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of ſenſe, we, for that reaſon, conceive them to be merely corporeal. We have a different apprehenſion of the pleaſant and painful feelings derived from ſeeing and hearing. Being inſenſible here of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic impreſſion, we are not miſled to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign a wrong place to theſe feelings; and therefore we naturally place them in the mind, where they really exiſt. Upon that account, they are conceived to be more refined and ſpiritual, than what are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from taſting, touching, and ſmelling.</p>
            <p>The pleaſures of the eye and ear being thus elevated above thoſe of the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſes, acquire ſo much dignity as to make them a laudable entertainment. They are not, however, ſet upon a level with thoſe that are purely intellectual; being not leſs inferior in dignity to intellectual pleaſures, than ſuperior to the organic or corporeal.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0258100201:11"/>
They indeed reſemble the latter, being like them produced by external objects: but they alſo reſemble the former, being like them produced without any ſenſible orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic impreſſion. Their mixt nature and middle place betwixt organic and intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual pleaſures, qualify them to aſſociate with either. Beauty heightens all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic feelings, as well as thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual. Harmony, though it aſpires to inflame devotion, diſdains not to improve the reliſh of a banquet.</p>
            <p>The pleaſures of the eye and ear have other valuable properties beſide thoſe of dignity and elevation. Being ſweet and moderately exhilerating, they are in their tone equally diſtant from the turbulence of paſſion, and languor of inaction; and by that tone are perfectly well qualified, not only to revive the ſpirits when ſunk by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual gratification, but alſo to relax them when overſtrained in any violent purſuit. Here is a remedy provided for many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. And to be convinced of its ſalutary effects, it will be ſufficient to run over the following particulars. Organic pleaſures
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0258100201:12"/>
have naturally a ſhort duration: when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued too long, or indulged to exceſs, they loſe their reliſh, and beget ſatiety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. To relieve us from that uneaſineſs, nothing can be more happily contrived than the exhilerating pleaſures of the eye and ear, which take place imperceptibly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much varying the tone of mind. On the other hand, any intenſe exerciſe of the intellectual powers, becomes painful by overſtraining the mind. Ceſſation from ſuch exerciſe gives not inſtant relief: it is neceſſary that the void be filled with ſome amuſement, gently relaxing the ſpirits<note n="*" place="bottom">Du Bos judiciouſly obſerves, that ſilence doth not tend to calm an agitated mind; but that ſoft and ſlow muſic hath a fine effect.</note>. Organic pleaſure, which hath no reliſh but while we are in vigour, is ill qualified for that office: but the finer pleaſures of ſenſe, which occupy without exhauſting the mind, are excellently well qualified to reſtore its uſual tone after ſevere application to ſtudy or buſineſs, as well as after ſatiety from ſenſual gratification.</p>
            <p>Our firſt perceptions are of external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0258100201:13"/>
and our firſt attachments are to them. Organic pleaſures take the lead. But the mind, gradually ripening, reliſheth more and more the pleaſures of the eye and ear; which approach the purely mental, without exhauſting the ſpirits; and exceed the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſual, without danger of ſatiety. The pleaſures of the eye and ear have accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly a natural aptitude to attract us from the immoderate gratification of ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. For the mind, once accuſtomed to enjoy a variety of external objects without being conſcious of the organic impreſſion, is prepared for enjoying internal objects where there cannot be an organic impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Thus the author of nature, by qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the human mind for a ſucceſſion of enjoyments from the loweſt to the higheſt, leads it by gentle ſteps from the moſt gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling corporeal pleaſures, for which ſolely it is fitted in the beginning of life, to thoſe refined and ſublime pleaſures which are ſuited to its maturity.</p>
            <p>This ſucceſſion, however, is not govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by unavoidable neceſſity. The God of nature offers it to us, in order to advance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0258100201:14"/>
our happineſs; and it is ſufficient, that he hath enabled us to complete the ſucceſſion. Nor has he made our taſk diſagreeable or difficult. On the contrary, the tranſition is ſweet and eaſy, from corporeal pleaſures to the more refined pleaſures of ſenſe; and not leſs ſo, from theſe to the exalted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of morality and religion. We ſtand therefore engaged in honour, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to ſecond the purpoſes of nature, by cultivating the pleaſures of the eye and ear, thoſe eſpecially that require extraordinary culture<note n="*" place="bottom">A taſte for natural objects is born with us in perfection. To reliſh a fine countenance, a rich landſcape, or a vivid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, culture is unneceſſary. The obſervation holds equally in natural ſounds, ſuch as the ſinging of birds, or the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of a brook. Nature here, the artificer of the object as well as of the percipient, hath ſuited them to each other with great accuracy. But of a poem, a cantata, a picture, and other artificial productions, a true reliſh is not commonly attained without ſtudy and practice.</note>, ſuch as are inſpired by poetry, painting, ſculpture, muſic, gardening, and architecture. This chiefly is the duty of the opulent, who have leiſure to improve their minds and their feelings. The fine arts are contrived to give pleaſure to the eye
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0258100201:15"/>
and the ear, diſregarding the inferior ſenſes. A taſte for theſe arts is a plant that grows naturally in many ſoils; but, without cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſcarce to perfection in any ſoil. It is ſuſceptible of much refinement; and is, by proper care, greatly improved. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, a taſte in the fine arts goes hand in hand with the moral ſenſe, to which indeed it is nearly allied. Both of them diſcover what is right and what is wrong. Faſhion, temper, and education, have an influence upon both, to vitiate them, or to preſerve them pure and untainted. Neither of them are arbitrary or local. They are rooted in human nature, and are governed by principles common to all men. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of morality belong not to the preſent undertaking. But as to the principles of the fine arts, they are evolved, by ſtudying the ſenſitive part of human nature, and by learning what objects are naturally agreeable, and what are naturally diſagreeable. The man who aſpires to be a critic in theſe arts, muſt pierce ſtill deeper. He muſt clearly perceive what objects are lofty, what low, what are proper or improper, what are man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0258100201:16"/>
and what are mean or trivial. Hence a foundation for judging of taſte, and for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning upon it. Where it is conformable to principles, we can pronounce with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it is correct; otherwiſe, that it is incorrect, and perhaps whimſical. Thus the fine arts, like morals, become a rational ſcience; and, like morals, may be cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a high degree of refinement.</p>
            <p>Manifold are the advantages of criticiſm, when thus ſtudied as a rational ſcience. In the firſt place, a thorough acquaintance with the principles of the fine arts, redoubles the entertainment theſe arts afford. To the man who reſigns himſelf entirely to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent or feeling, without interpoſing any ſort of judgment, poetry, muſic, painting, are mere paſtime. In the prime of life, indeed, they are delightful, being ſupported by the force of novelty, and the heat of imagination. But they loſe their reliſh gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually with their novelty; and are generally neglected in the maturity of life, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to more ſerious and more important occupations. To thoſe who deal in criticiſm as a regular ſcience, governed by juſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0258100201:17"/>
and giving ſcope to judgment as well as to fancy, the fine arts are a favourite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; and in old age maintain that reliſh which they produce in the morning of life<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>In the next place, a philoſophic inquiry into the principles of the fine arts, inures the reflecting mind to the moſt enticing ſort of logic. Reaſoning upon ſubjects ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable tends to a habit; and a habit, ſtrengthening the reaſoning faculties, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the mind for entering into ſubjects more difficult and abſtract. To have, in this reſpect, a juſt conception of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of criticiſm, we need but reflect upon the common method of education; which, after ſome years ſpent in acquiring languages, hurries us, without the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory diſcipline, into the moſt profound philoſophy. A more effectual method to alienate the tender mind from abſtract ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is beyond the reach of invention.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0258100201:18"/>
With reſpect to ſuch ſpeculations, the bulk of our youth contract a ſort of hobgoblin terror, which is ſeldom, if ever, ſubdued. Thoſe who apply to the arts, are trained in a very different manner. They are led, ſtep by ſtep, from the eaſier parts of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to what are more difficult; and are not permitted to make a new motion, till they be perfected in thoſe which regularly precede it. The ſcience of criticiſm appears then to be an intermediate link, finely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for connecting the different parts of education into a regular chain. This ſcience furniſheth an inviting opportunity to exerciſe the judgement: we delight to reaſon upon ſubjects that are equally pleaſant and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar: we proceed gradually from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler to the more involved caſes: and in a due courſe of diſcipline, cuſtom, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves all our faculties, beſtows acuteneſs upon thoſe of reaſon, ſufficient to unravel all the intricacies of philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Nor ought it to be overlooked, that the reaſonings employed upon the fine arts are of the ſame kind with thoſe which regulate our conduct. Mathematical and metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0258100201:19"/>
reaſonings have no tendency to improve ſocial intercourſe: nor are they applicable to the common affairs of life. But a juſt taſte in the fine arts, derived from rational principles, is a fine preparation for acting in the ſocial ſtate with dignity and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</p>
            <p>The ſcience of criticiſm tends to improve the heart not leſs than the underſtanding. I obſerve, in the firſt place, that it hath a fine effect in moderating the ſelfiſh affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A juſt taſte in the fine arts, by ſweetening and harmonizing the temper, is a ſtrong antidote to the turbulence of paſſion and violence of purſuit. Elegance of taſte procures to a man ſo much enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at home, or eaſily within reach, that in order to be occupied, he is, in youth, under no temptation to precipitate into hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gaming, drinking; nor, in middle age, to deliver himſelf over to ambition; nor, in old age, to avarice. Pride, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful ſelfiſh paſſion, exerts itſelf without control, when accompanied with a bad taſte. A man of this ſtamp, upon whom the moſt ſtriking beauty makes but a faint impreſſion,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0258100201:20"/>
feels no joy but in gratifying his ruling paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the diſcovery of errors and blemiſhes. Pride, on the other hand, finds in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution no enemy more formidable than a delicate and diſcerning taſte. The man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom nature and culture have beſtowed this bleſſing, feels great delight in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſpoſitions and actions of others. He loves to cheriſh them, and to publiſh them to the world. Faults and failings, it is true, are to him not leſs obvious: but theſe he avoids, or removes out of ſight, becauſe they give him pain. In a word, there may be other paſſions, which, for a ſeaſon, diſturb the peace of ſociety more than pride: but no other paſſion is ſo unwearied an antagoniſt to the ſweets of ſocial intercourſe. Pride, tending aſſiduouſly to its gratification, puts a man perpetually in oppoſition to others; and diſpoſes him more to reliſh bad than good qualities, even in a boſom friend. How different that diſpoſition of mind, where every virtue in a companion or neighbour, is, by refinement of taſte, ſet in its ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt light; and defects or blemiſhes, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0258100201:21"/>
to all, are ſuppreſſed, or kept out of view?</p>
            <p>In the next place, delicacy of taſte tends not leſs to invigorate the ſocial affections, than to moderate thoſe that are ſelfiſh. To be convinced of this tendency, we need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect, that delicacy of taſte neceſſarily heightens our ſenſibility of pain and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and of courſe our ſympathy, which is the capital branch of every ſocial paſſion. Sympathy in particular invites a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of joys and ſorrows, hopes and fears. Such exerciſe, ſoothing and ſatisfactory in itſelf, is productive neceſſarily of mutual good-will and affection.</p>
            <p>One other advantage of criticiſm is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the laſt place, being of all the moſt important, that it is a great ſupport to morality. I inſiſt on it with entire ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that no occupation attaches a man more to his duty than that of cultivating a taſte in the fine arts. A juſt reliſh of what is beautiful, proper, elegant, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, in writing or painting, in architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or gardening, is a fine preparation for diſcerning what is beautiful, juſt, elegant,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0258100201:22"/>
or magnanimous, in character and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. To the man who has acquired a taſte ſo acute and accompliſhed, every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wrong or improper, muſt be highly diſguſtful. If, in any inſtance, the over-bearing power of paſſion ſway him from his duty, he returns to it upon the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, with redoubled reſolution never to be ſwayed a ſecond time. He has now an additional motive to virtue, a conviction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from experience, that happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on regularity and order, and that a diſregard to juſtice or propriety never fails to be puniſhed with ſhame and remorſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Genius is allied to a warm and inflammable conſtitution, delicacy of taſte to calmneſs and ſedateneſs. Hence it is common to find genius in one who is a prey to every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which can ſcarce happen with reſpect to delicacy of taſte. Upon a man poſſeſſed of this bleſſing, the moral duties, as well as the fine arts, make a deep impreſſion, ſo as to counterbalance every irregular deſire. And even ſuppoſing a ſtrong temptation, it can take no faſt hold of a calm and ſedate temper.</note>.</p>
            <p>Rude ages exhibit the triumph of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over reaſon. Philoſophers anciently were divided into ſects: they were either Epicureans, Platoniſts, Stoics, Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0258100201:23"/>
or Sceptics. Men relied no farther upon their own judgement than to chuſe a leader, whom they implicitly followed. In later times, happily, reaſon hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the aſcendant. Men now aſſert their native privilege of thinking for themſelves, and diſdain to be ranked in any ſect, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the ſcience. I muſt except criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, which, by what fatality I know not, continues to be not leſs ſlaviſh in its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nor leſs ſubmiſſive to authority, than it was originally. Boſſu, a celebrated French critic, gives many rules; but can diſcover no better foundation for any of them, than the practice merely of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Virgil, ſupported by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Ariſtotle. Strange, that in ſo long a work, the concordance or diſcord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theſe rules with human nature, ſhould never once have entered his thoughts! It could not ſurely be his opinion, that theſe poets, however eminent for genius, were intitled to give laws to mankind, and that nothing now remains but blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their arbitrary will. If in writing they followed no rule, why ſhould they be imitated? If they ſtudied nature, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0258100201:24"/>
were obſequious to rational principles, why ſhould theſe be concealed from us?</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the preſent undertaking, it is not the author's intention to give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular treatiſe upon each of the fine arts in particular; but only, in general, to apply to them ſome remarks and obſervations drawn from human nature, the true ſource of criticiſm. The fine arts are calculated for our entertainment, or for making agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able impreſſions; and, by that circumſtance, are diſtinguiſhed from the uſeful arts. In order then to be a critic in the fine arts, it is neceſſary, as above hinted, to know what objects are naturally agreeable, and what naturally diſagreeable. A complete treatiſe on that ſubject would be a field by far too extenſive to be thoroughly cultivated by any one hand. The author pretends only to have entered upon the ſubject ſo far as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſupporting his critical remarks. And he aſſumes no merit from his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but that of evincing, perhaps more diſtinctly than hitherto has been done, that the genuine rules of criticiſm are all of them derived from the human heart. The
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0258100201:25"/>
ſenſitive part of our nature is a delightful ſpeculation. What the author hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered or collected upon that ſubject, he chuſes to impart in the gay and agreeable form of criticiſm; becauſe he imagines, that this form will be more reliſhed, and perhaps be not leſs inſtructive, than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and laboured diſquiſition. His plan is, to aſcend gradually to principles, from facts and experiments, inſtead of beginning with the former, handled abſtractly, and deſcending to the latter. But though cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm be thus his only declared aim, he will not diſown, that all along he had it in view, to explain the nature of man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a ſenſitive being, capable of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and pain. And though he flatters himſelf with having made ſome progreſs in that important ſcience, he is however too ſenſible of its extent and difficulty, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it profeſſedly, or to avow it as the chief purpoſe of the preſent work.</p>
            <p>To cenſure works, not men, is the juſt prerogative of criticiſm; and accordingly all perſonal cenſure is here avoided, unleſs where neceſſary to illuſtrate ſome general
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0258100201:26"/>
propoſition. No praiſe is claimed on that account; becauſe cenſuring with a view merely to find fault, is an entertainment that humanity never reliſhes. Writers, one would imagine, ſhould, above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, be reſerved upon that article, when they lie ſo open to retaliation. The author of this treatiſe, far from being confident of meriting no cenſure, entertains not even the ſlighteſt hope of ſuch perfection. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement was at firſt the ſole aim of his inquiries. Proceeding from one particular to another, the ſubject grew under his hand; and he was far advanced before the thought ſtruck him, that his private medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations might be publicly uſeful. In pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic, however, he would not appear in a ſlovenly dreſs; and therefore he pretends not otherwiſe to apologiſe for his errors, than by obſerving, that, in a new ſubject, not leſs nice than extenſive, errors are in ſome meaſure unavoidable. Neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends he to juſtify his taſte in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. That point muſt be extremely clear, which admits not variety of opinion; and in ſome matters ſuſceptible of great refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0258100201:27"/>
time is perhaps the only infallible touch-ſtone of taſte. To this he appeals, and to this he chearfully ſubmits.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER I. Perceptions and ideas in a train.</head>
            <p>A MAN while awake is ſenſible of a continued train of objects paſſing in his mind. It requires no activity on his part to carry on the train: nor has he power to vary it by calling up an object at will<note n="*" place="bottom">For how ſhould this be done? What object is it that we are to call up? If this queſtion can be anſwered, the object is already in the mind, and there is no occaſion to exert the power. If the queſtion cannot be anſwered, I next demand, how it is poſſible that a voluntary power can be exerted without any view of an object to exert it upon? We cannot form a conception of ſuch a thing. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appears to me ſatisfactory: if it need confirmation, I urge experience. Whoever makes a trial will find, that objects are linked together in the mind, forming a connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chain; and that we have not the command of any object independent of the chain.</note>. At the ſame time we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0258100201:29"/>
learn from daily experience, that a train of thought is not merely caſual. And if it depend not upon will, nor upon chance, we muſt try to evolve by what law it is governed. The ſubject is of import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the ſcience of human nature; and I promiſe beforehand, that it will be found of great importance in the fine arts.</p>
            <p>It appears that the relations by which things are linked together, have a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in directing the train of thought; and we find by experience, that objects are connected in the mind preciſely as they are externally. Beginning then with things external, we find that they are not more remarkable by their inherent properties than by their various relations. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any where extend our view without perceiving things connected together by certain relations. One thing perceived to be a cauſe, is connected with its ſeveral
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0258100201:30"/>
effects; ſome things are connected by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity in time, others by contiguity in place; ſome are connected by reſemblance, ſome by contraſt; ſome go before, ſome follow. Not a ſingle thing appears ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and altogether devoid of connection. The only difference is, that ſome are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected, ſome more ſlightly; ſome near, ſome at a diſtance.</p>
            <p>Experience as well as reaſon may ſatisfy us, that the train of mental perceptions is in a great meaſure regulated by the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relations. Where a number of things are linked together, the idea of any one ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts the reſt; and in this manner is a train of thoughts compoſed. Such is the law of ſucceſſion; whether an original law, or whether directed by ſome latent principle, is doubtful; and probably will for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo. This law, however, is not invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable. It ſometimes happens, though rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that an idea preſents itſelf to the mind without any connection, ſo far at leaſt as can be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>But though we have not the abſolute command of ideas, yet the Will hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0258100201:31"/>
influence in directing the order of connected ideas. There are few things but what are connected with many others. By this means, when any thing becomes an object, whether in a direct ſurvey, or ideal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only, it generally ſuggeſts many of its connections. Among theſe a choice is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded. We can inſiſt upon one, rejecting others; and we can even inſiſt upon what has the ſlighteſt connection. Where ideas are left to their natural courſe, they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally continued through the ſtrongeſt connections. The mind extends its view to a ſon more readily than to a ſervant, and more readily to a neighbour than to one living at a diſtance. This order may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Will, but ſtill within the limits of connected objects. In ſhort, every train of ideas muſt be a chain, in which the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ideas are linked to each other. We may vary the order of a natural train; but not ſo as to diſſolve it altogether, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our thoughts in a looſe manner without any connection. So far doth our power extend; and that power is ſufficient for all uſeful purpoſes. To give us more
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0258100201:32"/>
power, would probably be detrimental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being ſalutary.</p>
            <p>Will is not the only cauſe that prevents a train of thought from being continued through the ſtrongeſt connections. Much depends on the preſent tone of mind; for a ſubject that accords with this tone is always welcome. Thus, in good ſpirits, a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubject will be introduced by the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt connection; and one that is melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not leſs readily in low ſpirits. Again, an intereſting ſubject is recalled, from time to time, by any connection indifferently, ſtrong or weak. This is finely touched by Shakeſpear, with relation to a rich cargo at ſea.<q>

            </p>
            <p>Another cauſe clearly diſtinguiſhable from that now mentioned, hath alſo a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able influence over the train of ideas. In ſome minds of a ſingular frame, thoughts and circumſtances crowd upon each other by the ſlighteſt connection. I aſcribe this to a defect in the faculty of diſcernment. A perſon who cannot accurately diſtinguiſh betwixt a ſlight connection and one that is more ſolid, is equally affected with both. Such a perſon muſt neceſſarily have a great command of ideas, becauſe they are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by any relation indifferently; and the ſlighter relations, being without number, muſt furniſh ideas without end. This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is, in a lively manner, illuſtrated by Shakeſpear.<q>

            <p>On the other hand, a man of accurate judgement cannot have a great flow of ideas. The ſlighter relations making no figure in his mind, have no power to introduce ideas. And hence it is, that accurate judgement is not friendly to declamation or copious elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0258100201:35"/>
This reaſoning is confirmed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; for it is a noted obſervation, That a great or comprehenſive memory is ſeldom connected with a good judgement.</p>
            <p>As an additional confirmation, I appeal to another noted obſervation, That wit and judgement are ſeldom united. Wit conſiſts chiefly in joining things by diſtant and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful relations, which ſurpriſe becauſe they are unexpected. Such relations being of the ſlighteſt kind, readily occur to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only who makes every relation equally welcome. Wit, upon that account, is, in a good meaſure, incompatible with ſolid judgement; which, neglecting trivial rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, adheres to what are ſubſtantial and permanent. Thus memory and wit are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conjoined: ſolid judgement ſeldom with either.</p>
            <p>The train of thought depends not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon relations: another cauſe comes in for a ſhare; and that is the ſenſe of order and arrangement. To things of equal rank, where there is no room for a preference, order cannot be applied; and it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in what manner they be ſurveyed;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0258100201:36"/>
witneſs the ſheep that make a flock, or the trees in a wood. But in things of unequal rank, order is a governing principle. Thus our tendency is, to view the principal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before we deſcend to its acceſſories or ornaments, and the ſuperior before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior or dependent. We are equally averſe to enter into a minute conſideration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent parts, till the thing be firſt ſurveyed as a whole. In paſſing from a part to the whole, and from an acceſſory to its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, the connection is the ſame as in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite direction. But a ſenſe of order aids the tranſition in the latter caſe, and a ſenſe of diſorder obſtructs it in the former. It needs ſcarce be added, that in thinking or reflecting on any of theſe particulars, and in paſſing from one to another ideally, we are ſenſible of eaſineſs or difficulty preciſely as when they are ſet before our eyes.</p>
            <p>Our ſenſe of order is conſpicuous with reſpect to natural operations; for it always coincides with the order of nature. Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a body in motion, we follow its natural courſe. The mind falls with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy body, deſcends with a river, and aſcends
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0258100201:37"/>
with flame and ſmoke. In tracing out a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, we incline to begin at the founder, and to deſcend gradually to his lateſt poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. On the contrary, muſing on a lofty oak, we begin at the trunk, and mount from it to the branches. As to hiſtorical facts, we love to proceed in the order of time; or, which comes to the ſame, to proceed along the chain of cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>But though, in following out a hiſtorical chain, our bent is to proceed orderly from cauſes to their effects, we find not the ſame bent in matters of ſcience. There we ſeem rather diſpoſed to proceed from effects to their cauſes, and from particular propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to thoſe which are more general. Why this difference in matters that appear ſo nearly related? The caſes are ſimilar in appearance only, not in reality. In a hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical chain, every event is particular, the effect of ſome former event, and the cauſe of others that follow. In ſuch a chain, there is nothing to bias the mind from the order of nature. Widely different is the caſe of ſcience, when we endeavour to trace out
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0258100201:38"/>
cauſes and their effects. Many experiments are commonly reduced under one cauſe; and again, many of theſe under ſome one ſtill more general and comprehenſive. In our progreſs from particular effects to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes, and from particular propoſitions to the more comprehenſive, we feel a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual dilatation or expanſion of mind, like what is felt in proceeding along an aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeries, which is extremely delightful. The pleaſure here exceeds what ariſes from ſollowing the courſe of nature; and it is this pleaſure which regulates our train of thought in the caſe now mentioned, and in others that are ſimilar. Theſe obſervations, by the way, furniſh materials for inſtituting a compariſon betwixt the ſynthetic and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytic methods of reaſoning. The ſynthetic method deſcending regularly from princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to their conſequences, is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſtrictneſs of order. But in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the oppoſite courſe in the analytic method, we have a ſenſible pleaſure, like mounting upward, which is not felt in the other. The analytic method is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the imagination. The other method
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0258100201:39"/>
will be preferred by thoſe only who with rigidity adhere to order, and give no indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to natural emotions<note n="*" place="bottom">A train of perceptions or ideas, with reſpect to its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and variety, is handled afterward, chap. 9.</note>.</p>
            <p>It appears then that we are framed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to reliſh order and connection. When an object is introduced by a proper connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are conſcious of a certain pleaſure ariſing from that circumſtance. Among objects of equal rank, the pleaſure is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the degree of connection; but among unequal objects, where we require a certain order, the pleaſure ariſes chiefly from an orderly arrangement. Of this one may be made ſenſible, in tracing objects contrary to the courſe of nature, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our ſenſe of order. The mind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with alacrity from a whole to its parts, and from a principal to its acceſſories; but in the contrary direction, it is ſenſible of a ſort of retrograde motion, which is unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. And here may be remarked the great influence of order upon the mind of man. Grandeur, which makes a deep impreſſion,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0258100201:40"/>
inclines us, in running over any ſeries, to proceed from ſmall to great, rather than from great to ſmall. But order prevails over this tendency; and in paſſing from the whole to its parts, and from a ſubject to its ornaments, affords pleaſure as well as facility, which are not felt in the oppoſite courſe. Elevation touches the mind not leſs than grandeur doth; and in raiſing the mind to elevated objects, there is a ſenſible pleaſure. But the courſe of nature hath ſtill a greater influence than elevation; and therefore the pleaſure of falling with rain, and deſcending gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a river, prevails over that of mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upward. Hence the agreeableneſs of ſmoke aſcending in a calm morning. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation concurs with the courſe of nature, to make this object delightful.</p>
            <p>I am extremely ſenſible of the diſguſt men generally have at abſtract ſpeclation; and for that reaſon I would avoid it altogether, were it poſſible in a work which profeſſes to draw the rules of criticiſm from human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, their true ſource. There is indeed no choice, other than to continue for ſome
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0258100201:41"/>
time in the ſame track, or to abandon the undertaking altogether. Candor obliges me to notify this to my readers, that ſuch of them whoſe averſion to abſtract ſpeculation is invincible, may ſtop ſhort here; for till principles be explained, I can promiſe no entertainment to thoſe who ſhun thinking. But I flatter myſelf with a different taſte in the bulk of readers. Some few, I imagine, will reliſh the abſtract part for its own ſake; and many for the uſeful purpoſes to which it may be applied. For encouraging the latter to proceed with alacrity, I aſſure them beforehand that the foregoing ſpeculation leads to many important rules of criticiſm, which ſhall be unfolded in the courſe of this work. In the mean time, for inſtant ſatisfaction in part, they will be pleaſed to accept the following ſpecimen.</p>
            <p>It is required in every work of art, that, like an organic ſyſtem, the conſtituent parts be mutually connected, and bear each of them a relation to the whole, ſome more intimate, ſome leſs, according to their deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Order is not leſs eſſential than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection; and when due regard is paid to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0258100201:42"/>
theſe, we have a ſenſe of juſt compoſition, and ſo far are pleaſed with the performance. Homer is defective in order and connection; and Pindar more remarkably. Regularity, order, and connection, are painful reſtraints on a bold and fertile imagination; and are not patiently ſubmitted to, but after much culture and diſcipline. In Horace there is no fault more eminent than want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection. Inſtances are without number. In the firſt fourteen lines of ode 7. lib. 1. he mentions ſeveral towns and diſtricts which by ſome were reliſhed more than by others. In the remainder of the ode, Plancus is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to drown his cares in wine. Having narrowly eſcaped death by the fall of a tree, this poet<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 2. ode 13.</note> takes occaſion properly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that while we guard againſt ſome dangers, we are expoſed to others we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not foreſee. He ends with diſplaying the power of muſic. The parts of ode 16. lib. 2. are ſo looſely connected as to disfigure a poem otherwiſe extremely beautiful. The 1ſt, 2d, 3d, 4th, 11th, 24th, 27th odes of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0258100201:43"/>
3d book, lie open all of them to the ſame cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The 1ſt ſatire, book 1. is ſo deformed by want of unity and connection of parts, as upon the whole to be ſcarce agreeable. It commences with an important queſtion, How it happens that perſons who are ſo much ſatisfied with themſelves, are generally ſo little with their condition? After illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the obſervation in a ſprightly manner by ſeveral examples, the author, forgetting his ſubject, enters upon a declamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt avarice, which he purſues till the line 108. There he makes an apology for wandering, and promiſes to return to his ſubject. But avarice having got poſſeſſion of his mind, he follows out that theme to the end, and never returns to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed in the beginning.</p>
            <p>In the Georgies of Virgil, though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the moſt finiſhed work of that author, the parts are ill connected, and the tranſitions far from being ſweet and eaſy. In the firſt book<note n="*" place="bottom">Lin. 231.</note> he deviates from his ſubject to give a deſcription of the five
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0258100201:44"/>
zones. The want of connection here is remarkable, as well as in the deſcription of the prodigies that accompanied the death of Caeſar, with which the ſame book is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. A digreſſion upon the praiſes of Italy in the ſecond book<note n="*" place="bottom">Lin. 136.</note>, is not more happily introduced. And in the midſt of a declamation upon the pleaſures of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, that makes part of the ſame book<note n="†" place="bottom">Lin. 475.</note>, the author appears perſonally upon the ſtage without the ſlighteſt connection. The two prefaces of Salluſt look as if they had been prefixed by ſome blunder to his two hiſtories. They will ſuit any other hiſtory as well, or any ſubject as well as hiſtory. Even the members of theſe prefaces are but looſely connected. They look more like a number of maxims or obſervations than a connected diſcourſe.</p>

and acceſſory being pretty intimate, an epiſode looſely connected with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſubject will never be graceful. I give for an example the deſcent of Aeneas into hell, which employs the ſixth book of the Aeneid. The reader is not prepared for this important event. No cauſe is aſſigned, that can make it appear neceſſary or even natural, to ſuſpend, for ſo long a time, the principal action in its moſt intereſting pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. To engage Aeneas to wander from his courſe in ſearch of an adventure ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, the poet can find no better pretext, than the hero's longing to viſit the ghoſt of his father recently dead. In the mean time the ſtory is interrupted, and the reader loſes his ardor. An epiſode ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely beautiful is not at any rate to be diſpenſed with. It is pity however, that it doth not ariſe more naturally from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I muſt obſerve at the ſame time, that full juſtice is done to this incident, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it to be an epiſode; for if it be a conſtituent part of the principal action, the connection ought to be ſtill more intimate. The ſame objection lies againſt that elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

deſcription of Fame in the Aeneid<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 4. lin. 173.</note>. Any other book of that heroic poem, or of any heroic poem, has as good a title to that deſcription as the book where it is placed.</p>
            <p>In a natural landſcape, we every day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a multitude of objects connected by contiguity ſolely. Objects of ſight make an impreſſion ſo lively, as that a relation, even of the ſlighteſt kind, is reliſhed. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ought not to be imitated in deſcription. Words are ſo far ſhort of the eye in liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of impreſſion, that in a deſcription the connection of objects ought to be carefully ſtudied, in order to make the deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. For it is a known fact, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is ſuggeſted above, that it is eaſier by words to introduce into the mind a related object, than one which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the preceding train.

            <p>The relations among objects have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable influence in the gratification of our paſſions, and even in their production.

            <p>There is perhaps not another inſtance of a building ſo great erected upon a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ſlight in appearance, as that which is

erected upon the relations of objects and their arrangement. Relations make no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital figure in the mind: the bulk of them are tranſitory, and ſome extremely trivial. They are however the links that, uniting our perceptions into one connected chain, produce connection of action, becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and actions have an intimate corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence. But it is not ſufficient for the conduct of life that our actions be linked together, however intimately: it is beſide neceſſary that they proceed in a certain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and this alſo is provided for by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal propenſity. Thus order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, while they admit ſufficient variety, introduce a method in the management of affairs. Without them our conduct would be fluctuating and deſultory; and we would be hurried from thought to thought, and from action to action, entirely at the mercy of chance.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Emotions and Paſſions.</head>
            <p>THE fine arts, as obſerved above<note n="*" place="bottom">Introduction.</note>, are all of them calculated to give pleaſure to the eye or the ear; and they never deſcend to gratify the taſte, touch, or ſmell. At the ſame time, the feelings of the eye and ear, are of all the feelings of external ſenſe, thoſe only which are honoured with the name of <hi>emotions</hi> or <hi>paſſions.</hi> It is alſo obſerved above<note n="†" place="bottom">Introduction.</note>, that the principles of the fine arts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded by ſtudying the ſenſitive part of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, in order to know what objects of the eye and ear are agreeable, what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable. Theſe obſervations ſhow the uſe of the preſent chapter. We evidently muſt be acquainted with the nature and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of emotions and paſſions, before we can judge with any accuracy how far they are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0258100201:54"/>
under the power of the fine arts. The cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical art is thus ſet in a fine point of view. The inquiſitive mind beginning with cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm the moſt agreeable of all amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and finding no obſtruction in its progreſs, advances far into the ſenſitive part of our nature; and gains inſenſibly a thorough knowledge of the human heart, of its deſires, and of every motive to action; a ſcience which of all that can be reached by man, is to him of the greateſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Upon a ſubject ſo extenſive, all that can be expected here, is a general or ſlight ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey. Some emotions indeed more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly connected with the fine arts, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to handle in ſeparate chapters; a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that will ſhorten the general ſurvey conſiderably. And yet, after this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, ſo much matter comes under even a general view of the paſſions and emotions, that, to avoid confuſion, I find it neceſſary to divide this chapter into many parts: in the firſt of which are handled the cauſes of thoſe emotions and paſſions that are the moſt common and familiar; for to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0258100201:55"/>
every paſſion and emotion, however ſingular, would be an endleſs work. And though I could not well take up leſs ground, without ſeparating things intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected; yet, upon examination, I find the cauſes of our emotions and paſſions to be ſo numerous and various, as to make a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſion alſo neceſſary by ſplitting this firſt part into ſeveral ſections. Human nature is a complicated machine, and muſt be ſo to anſwer all its purpoſes. There have indeed been publiſhed to the world, many a ſyſtem of human nature, that flatter the mind by their ſimplicity. But theſe, unluckily, deviate far from truth and reality. According to ſome writers, man is entirely a ſelfiſh being: according to others, univerſal benevolence is his duty. One founds morality upon ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy ſolely, and one upon utility. If any of theſe ſyſtems were of nature's produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the preſent ſubject might be ſoon diſcuſſed. But the variety of nature is not ſo eaſily reached; and for confuting ſuch Utopian ſyſtems without the intricacy of reaſoning, it appears the beſt method to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0258100201:56"/>
enter into human nature, and to ſet before the eye, plainly and candidly, facts as they really exiſt.</p>

                  <p>THeſe branches are ſo interwoven, as to make it neceſſary that they be handled together. It is a fact univerſally admitted, that no emotion nor paſſion ever ſtarts up in the mind, without a known cauſe. If I love a perſon, it is for good qualities or good offices: if I have reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt a man, it muſt be for ſome injury he has done me; and I cannot pity any one, who is under no diſtreſs of body or of mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0258100201:57"/>
The circumſtances now mentioned, if they cauſe or occaſion a paſſion, cannot be entirely indifferent: if they were, they could not move us in any degree. And we find upon examination, that they are not indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Looking back upon the foregoing examples, the good qualities or good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that attract my love, are antecedently agreeable. If an injury were not diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it would not occaſion any reſentment againſt the author; nor would the paſſion of pity be raiſed by an object in diſtreſs, if that object did not give us pain. Theſe feelings antecedent to paſſion, and which ſeem to be the cauſes of paſſion, ſhall be diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>emotions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is now ſaid about the production of paſſion, reſolves into a very ſimple propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That we love what is pleaſant, and hate what is painful. And indeed it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that without antecedent emotions we could not have any paſſions; for a thing muſt be pleaſant or painful, before it can be the object either of love or of hatred.</p>
                  <p>As it appears from this ſhort ſketch, that paſſions are generated by means of prior e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0258100201:58"/>
it will be neceſſary to take firſt under conſideration emotions and their cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Such is the conſtitution of our nature, that upon perceiving certain external objects, we are inſtantaneouſly conſcious of pleaſure or pain. A flowing river, a ſmooth extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plain, a ſpreading oak, a towering hill, are objects of ſight that raiſe pleaſant emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A barren heath, a dirty marſh, a rotten carcaſs, raiſe painful emotions. Of the emotions thus produced, we inquire for no other cauſe but merely the preſence of the object.</p>
                  <p>It muſt further be obſerved, that the things now mentioned, raiſe emotions by means of their properties and qualities. To the emotion raiſed by a large river, its ſize, its force, and its fluency, contribute each a ſhare. The pleaſures of regularity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, convenience, compoſe the emotion raiſed by a fine building.</p>
                  <p>If external properties make a being or thing agreeable, we have reaſon to expect the ſame effect from thoſe which are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and accordingly power, diſcernment,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0258100201:59"/>
wit, mildneſs, ſympathy, courage, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, render the poſſeſſor agreeable in a high degree. So ſoon as theſe qualities are perceived in any perſon, we inſtantaneouſly feel pleaſant emotions, without the ſlighteſt act of reflection or of attention to conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is almoſt unneceſſary to add, that certain qualities oppoſite to the former, ſuch as dullneſs, peeviſhneſs, inhumanity, coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, occaſion in the ſame manner painful emotions.</p>
                  <p>Senſible beings affect us remarkably by their actions. Some actions ſo ſoon as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, raiſe pleaſant emotions in the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, without the leaſt reflection; ſuch as graceful motion and genteel behaviour. But as the intention of the agent is a capital circumſtance in the bulk of human actions, it requires reflection to diſcover their true character. If I ſee one delivering a purſe of money to another, I can make nothing of this action, till I diſcover with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention the money is given. If it be given to extinguiſh a debt, the action is agreeable in a ſlight degree. If it be a grateful return, I feel a ſtronger emotion; and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0258100201:60"/>
emotion riſes to a great height when it is the intention of the giver to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a virtuous family from want. Actions are thus qualified by the intention of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. But they are not qualified by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; for an action well intended is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whatever be the conſequence. The pleaſant or painful emotion that ariſeth from contemplating human actions, is of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar kind. Human actions are perceived to be <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi>; and this perception qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies the pleaſure or pain that reſults from them<note n="*" place="bottom">In tracing our emotions and paſſions to their origin, it once was my opinion, that qualities and actions are the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſes of emotions; and that theſe emotions are afterward expanded upon the being to which theſe qualities and actions belong. But I have diſcovered that opinion to be erroneous. An attribute is not, even in imagination, ſeparable from the being to which it belongs; and for that reaſon, cannot of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be the cauſe of any emotion. We have, it is true, no knowledge of any being or ſubſtance but by means of its attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; and therefore no being can be agreeable to us otherwiſe than by their means. But ſtill, when an emotion is raiſed, it is the being itſelf, as we apprehend the matter, which raiſes the emotion; and it raiſes it by means of one or other of its attributes. If it be urged, That we can in idea abſtract a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from the thing to which it belongs; it might be anſwered, That an abſtract idea, which ſerves excellently the purpoſes of reaſoning, is too faint and too much ſtrained to produce any ſort of emotion. But it is ſufficient for the preſent purpoſe to anſwer, That the eye never abſtracts. By this organ we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive things as they really exiſt, and never perceive a quality as ſeparated from the ſubject. Hence it muſt be evident, that emotions are raiſed, not by qualities abſtractly conſidered, but by the ſubſtance or body ſo and ſo qualified. Thus a ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oak raiſes a pleaſant emotion, by means of its colour, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, umbrage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not the colour ſtrictly ſpeaking that produces the emotion, but the tree as coloured: it is not the figure abſtractly conſidered that produces the emotion, but the tree conſidered as of a certain figure. And hence by the way it appears, that the beauty of ſuch an object is complex, reſolvable into ſeveral beauties more ſimple.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0258100201:61"/>
Not only are emotions raiſed in us by the qualities and actions of others, but alſo by their feelings. I cannot behold a man in diſtreſs, without partaking of his pain; nor in joy, without partaking of his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The beings or things above deſcribed, occaſion emotions in us, not only in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſurvey, but when they are recalled to the memory in idea. A field laid out with taſte, is pleaſant in the recollection, as well as when under our eye. A generous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſcribed in words or colours, occaſions a ſenſible emotion, as well as when we ſee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0258100201:62"/>
it performed. And when we reflect upon the diſtreſs of any perſon, our pain is of the ſame kind with what we felt when eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes. In a word, an agreeable or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable object recalled to the mind in idea, is the occaſion of a pleaſant or painful emotion, of the ſame kind with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced when the object was preſent. The only difference is, that an idea being fainter than an original perception, the pleaſure or pain produced by the former, is proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fainter than that produced by the latter.</p>
                  <p>Having explained the nature of an emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mentioned ſeveral cauſes by which it is produced, we proceed to an obſervation of conſiderable importance in the ſcience of human nature, that ſome emotions are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with deſire, and that others, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort exiſtence, paſs away without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing deſire of any ſort. The emotion raiſed by a fine landſcape or a magnificent building, vaniſheth generally without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taching our hearts to the object; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo happens with relation to a number of fine faces in a crowded aſſembly. But the bulk of emotions are accompanied with deſire of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0258100201:63"/>
one ſort or other, provided only a fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for deſire be ſuggeſted. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably the caſe of emotions raiſed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man actions and qualities. A virtuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raiſeth in every ſpectator a pleaſant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, which is generally attended with a deſire to do good to the author of the action. A vicious action, on the other hand, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a painful emotion; and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence a deſire to have the author puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Even things inanimate often raiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. The goods of fortune are objects of deſire almoſt univerſally; and the deſire, when more than commonly vigorous, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the name of <hi>avarice.</hi> The pleaſant emotion produced in a ſpectator by a capital picture in the poſſeſſion of a prince, ſeldom raiſeth deſire. But if ſuch a picture be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſale, deſire of having or poſſeſſing is the natural conſequence of the emotion.</p>
                  <p>If now an emotion be ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of deſire, ſomtimes not, it comes to be a material inquiry, in what reſpect a paſſion differs from an emotion. Is paſſion in its nature or feeling diſtinguiſhable from emotion? I have been apt to think that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0258100201:64"/>
there muſt be a diſtinction, when the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems in all caſes to precede the paſſion, and to be the cauſe or occaſion of it. But after the ſtricteſt examination, I cannot perceive any ſuch diſtinction betwixt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and paſſion. What is love to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, for example, but a pleaſant emotion raiſed by a ſight or idea of the perſon belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, joined with deſire of enjoyment? In what elſe conſiſts the paſſion of reſentment, but in a painful emotion occaſioned by the injury, accompanied with deſire to chaſtiſe the author of the injury? In general, as to every ſort of paſſion, we find no more in the compoſition, but the particulars now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, an emotion pleaſant or painful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with deſire. What then ſhall we ſay upon this ſubject? Are <hi>paſſion</hi> and <hi>emotion</hi> ſynonymous terms? This cannot be averred. No feeling nor agitation of the mind void of deſire, is termed a paſſion; and we have diſcovered that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny emotions which paſs away without rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing deſire of any kind. How is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to be ſolved? There appears to me but one ſolution, which I reliſh the more,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0258100201:65"/>
as it renders the doctrine of the paſſions and emotions ſimple and perſpicuous. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution follows. An internal motion or agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the mind, when it paſſeth away without raiſing deſire, is denominated <hi>an emotion:</hi> when deſire is raiſed, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or agitation is denominated <hi>a paſſion.</hi> A fine face, for example, raiſeth in me a pleaſant feeling. If this feeling vaniſh without producing any effect, it is in proper language an emotion. But if ſuch feeling, by reiterated views of the object, become ſufficiently ſtrong to raiſe deſire, it is no longer termed an emotion, but a paſſion. The ſame holds in all the other paſſions. The painful feeling raiſed in a ſpectator by a ſlight injury done to a ſtranger, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with no deſire of revenge, is termed an emotion. But this injury raiſeth in the ſtranger a ſtronger emotion, which being accompanied with deſire of revenge, is a paſſion. Again, external expreſſions of diſtreſs, produce in the ſpectator a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful feeling. This feeling is ſometimes ſo ſlight as to paſs away without any effect, in which caſe it is an emotion. But if the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0258100201:66"/>
feeling be ſo ſtrong as to prompt deſire of affording relief, it is a paſſion, and is termed <hi>pity.</hi> Envy is emulation in exceſs. If the exaltation of a competitor be barely diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, the painful feeling is reckoned an emotion. If it produce deſire to depreſs him, it is reckoned a paſſion.</p>
                  <p>To prevent miſtakes, it muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that deſire here is taken in its proper ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that internal impulſe which makes us proceed to action. Deſire in a lax ſenſe reſpects alſo actions and events that depend not on us, as when I deſire that my friend may have a ſon to repreſent him, or that my country may flouriſh in arts and ſciences. But ſuch internal act is more properly termed a <hi>wiſh</hi> than a <hi>deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having diſtinguiſhed paſſion from emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we proceed to conſider paſſion more at large, with reſpect eſpecially to its power of producing action.</p>
                  <p>We have daily and conſtant experience for our authority, that no man ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to action but through the impulſe of ſome antecedent deſire. So well eſtabliſhed is this obſervation, and ſo deeply rooted in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0258100201:67"/>
the mind, that we can ſcarce imagine a different ſyſtem of action. Even a child will ſay familiarly, What ſhould make me do this or that when I have no inclination to it? Taking it then for granted, that the exiſtence of action depends on antecedent deſire; it follows, that where there is no deſire there can be no action. This opens another ſhining diſtinction betwixt emotions and paſſions. The former, being without deſire, are in their nature quieſcent: the latter, involving deſire, have a tendency to action, and always produce action where they meet with no obſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that every paſſion muſt have an object, <hi>viz.</hi> that being or thing to which our deſire is directed, and with a view to which every action prompted by that deſire is performed. The object of every paſſion is that being or thing which produced it. This will be evident from induction. A fine woman, by her beauty, cauſes in me the paſſion of love, which is directed upon her as its object. A man by injuring me, raiſes my reſentment; and becomes thereby the object of my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0258100201:68"/>
Thus the cauſe of a paſſion, and its object, are the ſame in different views. An emotion, on the other hand, being in its nature quieſcent and merely a paſſive feeling, muſt have a cauſe; but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid properly ſpeaking to have an object.</p>
                  <p>As the deſire involved in every paſſion leads to action, this action is either ultimate, or it is done as a means to ſome end. Where the action is ultimate, reaſon and reflection bear no part. The action is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed blindly by the impulſe of paſſion, without any view. Thus one in extreme hunger ſnatches at food, without the ſlighteſt reflection whether it be ſalutary or not: Avarice prompts to accumulate wealth without the leaſt view of uſe; and thereby abſurdly converts means into an end: Fear often makes us fly before we reflect whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we really be in danger: and animal love not leſs often hurries to fruition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſingle thought of gratification. But for the moſt part, actions are performed as means to ſome end; and in theſe actions reaſon and reflection always bear a part.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0258100201:69"/>
The end is that event which is deſired; and the action is deliberately performed in order to bring about that end. Thus affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my friend involves a deſire to make him happy; and the deſire to accompliſh that end, prompts me to perform what I judge will contribute to it.</p>
                  <p>Where the action is ultimate, it hath a cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the impulſe of the paſſion. But we cannot properly ſay it hath a motive. This term is appropriated to actions that are performed as means to ſome end; and the conviction that the action will tend to bring about the end deſired, is termed a motive. Thus paſſions conſidered as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of action, are diſtinguiſhed into two kinds; inſtinctive, and deliberative. The firſt operating blindly and by mere impulſe, depend entirely upon the ſenſitive part of our nature. The other operating by reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and by motives, are connected with the rational part.</p>
                  <p>The foregoing difference among the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is the work of nature. Experience brings on ſome variations. By all actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed through the impulſe of paſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0258100201:70"/>
is gratified, and the gratification is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. This leſſon we have from experience. And hence it is, that after an action has often been performed by the impulſe merely of paſſion, the pleaſure reſulting from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, conſidered beforehand, becomes a motive, which joins its force with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal impulſe in determining us to act. Thus a child eats by the mere impulſe of hunger: a young man thinks of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of gratification, which is a motive for him to eat: and a man farther advanced in life, hath the additional motive that it will contribute to his health.</p>
                  <p>Inſtinctive paſſions are diſtinguiſhed into two kinds. Where the cauſe is internal, they are denominated <hi>appetites:</hi> where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, they retain the common name of <hi>paſſions.</hi> Thus hunger, thirſt, animal love, are termed <hi>appetites</hi>; while fear and anger, even when they operate blindly and by mere impulſe, are termed <hi>paſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the definition of a motive above given, it is eaſy to determine, with the greateſt accuracy, what paſſions are ſelfiſh, what ſocial. No paſſion can properly be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0258100201:71"/>
termed ſelfiſh, but what prompts me to exert actions in order for my own good; nor ſocial, but what prompts me to exert actions in order for the good of another. The motive is that which determines a paſſion to be ſocial or ſelfiſh. Hence it follows, that our appetites, which make us act blindly and by mere impulſe, cannot be reckoned either ſocial or ſelfiſh; and as little the actions they produce. Thus eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when prompted by an impulſe merely of nature, is neither ſocial nor ſelfiſh. But add a motive, That it will contribute to my pleaſure or my health, and it becomes in a meaſure ſelfiſh. On the other hand, when affection moves me to exert actions to the end ſolely of advancing my friend's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without the ſlighteſt regard to my own gratification, ſuch actions are juſtly denominated <hi>ſocial</hi>; and ſo is the affection that is their cauſe. If another motive be added, That gratifying the affection will contribute to my own happineſs, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I perform become partly ſelfiſh. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal love when exerted into action by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural impulſe ſingly, is neither ſocial nor ſelfiſh: when exerted with a view to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0258100201:72"/>
and in order to make me happy, it is ſelfiſh. When the motive of giving pleaſure to its object is ſuperadded, it is partly ſocial, partly ſelfiſh. A juſt action when prompted by the love of juſtice ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is neither ſocial nor ſelfiſh. When I perform an act of juſtice with a view to the pleaſure of gratification, the action is ſelfiſh. I pay my debt for my own ſake, not with a view to benefit my creditor. But let me ſuppoſe the money has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by a friend without intereſt, purely to oblige me. In this caſe, together with the inclination to do juſtice, there ariſes a motive of gratitude, which reſpects the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor ſolely, and prompts me to act in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to do him good. Here the action is partly ſocial, partly ſelfiſh. Suppoſe again I meet with a ſurpriſing and unexpected act of generoſity, that inſpires me with love to my benefactor and the utmoſt gratitude. I burn to do him good: he is the ſole object of my deſire; and my own pleaſure in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the deſire, vaniſheth out of ſight. In this caſe, the action I perform is purely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. Thus it happens, that when a ſocial motive becomes ſtrong, the action is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0258100201:73"/>
with a view ſingly to the object of the paſſion; and the ſelfiſh pleaſure ariſing from gratification is never once conſidered. The ſame effect of ſtifling ſelfiſh motives, is equally remarkable in other paſſions that are in no view ſocial. Ambition, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when confined to exaltation as its ultimate end, is neither ſocial nor ſelfiſh. Let exaltation be conſidered as a means to make me happy, and the paſſion becomes ſo far ſelfiſh. But if the deſire of exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wax ſtrong and inflame my mind, the ſelfiſh motive now mentioned is no longer felt. A ſlight degree of reſentment, where my chief view in acting is the pleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing to myſelf from gratifying the paſſion, is juſtly denominated <hi>ſelfiſh.</hi> Where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge flames ſo high as to have no other aim but the deſtruction of its object, it is no longer ſelfiſh. In oppoſition to a ſocial paſſion, it may be termed <hi>diſſocial</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">When this analyſis of human nature is conſidered, not one article of which can with any ſhadow of truth be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, I cannot help being ſurpriſed at the blindneſs of ſome philoſophers, who, by dark and confuſed notions, are led to deny all motives to action but what ariſe from ſelf-love. Man, for ought appears, might poſſibly have been ſo framed, as to be ſuſceptible of no paſſions but what have ſelf for their object. But man thus framed, would be ill fitted for ſociety. Much better is the matter ordered, by enduing him with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions directed entirely to the good of others, as well as with paſſions directed entirely to his own good.</note>.</p>

                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0258100201:74"/>
Of ſelf, every one hath a direct percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: of other things, we have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but by means of their attributes. Hence it is, that of ſelf, the perception is more lively than of any other thing. Self is an agreeable object; and, for the reaſon now given, muſt be more agreeable than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object. Is not this ſufficient to account for the prevalence of ſelf-love?</p>
                  <p>In the foregoing part of this chapter, it is ſuggeſted, that ſome circumſtances make beings or things fit objects for deſire, others not. This hint muſt be purſued. It is a truth aſcertained by univerſal experience, that a thing which in our apprehenſion is beyond reach, never is the object of deſire. No man, in his right ſenſes, deſires to walk in the air, or to deſcend to the centre of the earth. We may amuſe ourſelves in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie, with building caſtles in the air, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0258100201:75"/>
wiſhing for what can never happen. But ſuch things never move deſire. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a deſire to act would be altogether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, when we are conſcious that the action is beyond our power. In the next place, though the difficulty of attainment with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to things within reach, often inflames deſire; yet where the proſpect of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is faint and the event extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, the object, however agreeable, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom raiſeth any ſtrong deſire. Thus beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or other good qualities in a woman of rank, ſeldom raiſes love in any man greatly her inſerior. In the third place, different objects, equally within reach, raiſe emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in different degrees; and when deſire accompanies any of theſe emotions, its ſtrength, as is natural, is proportioned to that of its cauſe. Hence the remarkable difference among deſires directed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings inanimate, animate, and rational. The emotion cauſed by a rational being, is out of meaſure ſtronger than any cauſed by an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal without reaſon; and an emotion raiſed by ſuch an animal, is ſtronger than what is cauſed by any thing inanimate. There is a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0258100201:76"/>
ſeparate reaſon why deſire of which a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional being is the object ſhould be the ſtrongeſt. Deſire directed upon ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is gratified many ways, by loving, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, benefiting, the object; and it is a well known truth, that our deſires naturally ſwell by exerciſe. Deſire directed upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate being, ſuſceptible neither of pleaſure nor pain, is not capable of a higher gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation than that of acquiring the property. Hence it is, that though every feeling which raiſeth deſire, is ſtrictly ſpeaking a paſſion; yet commonly thoſe feelings only are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated paſſions of which ſenſible beings capable of pleaſure and pain are the objects.</p>

                  <p>THis ſubject was purpoſely reſerved for a ſeparate ſection, becauſe it could not, with perſpicuity, be handled under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral head. An emotion involving deſire is termed <hi>a paſſion</hi>; and when the deſire is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0258100201:77"/>
fulfilled, the paſſion is ſaid to be gratified. The gratification of every paſſion muſt be pleaſant, or in other words produce a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant emotion; for nothing can be more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, than that the accompliſhment of any wiſh or deſire ſhould affect us with joy. I cannot even except the caſe, where a man, through remorſe, is deſirous to chaſtiſe and puniſh himſelf. The joy of gratification is properly called an emotion; becauſe it makes us happy in our preſent ſituation, and is ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate in its nature, not having a tendency to any thing beyond. On the other hand, ſorrow muſt be the reſult of an event con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what we deſire; for if the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of deſire produce joy, it is equally natural that diſappointment ſhould produce ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>An event fortunate or unfortunate, that falls out by accident without being foreſeen or thought of, and which therefore could not be the object of deſire, raiſeth an emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame kind with that now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. But the cauſe muſt be different; for there can be no gratification where there is no deſire. We have not however far to

ſeek for a cauſe. A man cannot be indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to an event that affects him or any of his connections. If it be fortunate, it gives him joy; if unfortunate, it gives him ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                  <p>In no ſituation doth joy riſe to a greater height, than upon the removal of any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſtreſs of mind or body; and in no ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation doth ſorrow riſe to a greater height, than upon the removal of what makes us happy. The ſenſibility of our nature ſerves in part to account for theſe effects. Other cauſes alſo concur. We can be under no violent diſtreſs without an anxious deſire to be free from it; and therefore its removal is a high gratification. We cannot be poſſeſſed of any thing that makes us happy, without wiſhing its continuance; and therefore its removal by croſſing our wiſhes muſt create ſorrow. Nor is this all. The principle of contraſt comes in for its ſhare. An emotion of joy ariſing upon the removal of pain, is increaſed by contraſt when we reflect upon our former diſtreſs. En emotion of ſorrow upon being deprived of any good, is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0258100201:79"/>

                  <p>It hath always been reckoned difficult to account for the extreme pleaſure that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a ceſſation of bodily pain; as when one is relieved from the rack, or from a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fit of the ſtone. What is ſaid, explains this difficulty in the eaſieſt and ſimpleſt manner. Ceſſation of bodily pain is not of itſelf a pleaſure; for a <hi>non-ens</hi> or a negative can neither give pleaſure nor pain. But man is ſo framed by nature as to rejoice when he is eaſed of pain, as well as to be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful when deprived of any good. This branch of our conſtitution, is chiefly the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0258100201:80"/>
cauſe of the pleaſure. The gratification of deſire comes in as an acceſſory cauſe; and contraſt joins its force, by increaſing the ſenſe of our preſent happineſs. In the caſe of an acute pain, a peculiar circumſtance contributes its part. The briſk circulation of the animal ſpirits occaſioned by acute pain, continues after the pain is vaniſhed, and produceth a very pleaſant feeling. Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath not that effect, becauſe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with a depreſſion of ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that the gradual dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of acute pain, occaſions a mixt emotion, partly pleaſant, partly painful. The partial diminution produceth joy in proportion; but the remaining pain balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth our joy. This mixt feeling, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, hath no long endurance. For the joy that ariſeth upon the diminution of pain, ſoon vaniſheth; and leaveth in the undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed poſſeſſion, that degree of pain which remains.</p>
                  <p>What is above obſerved about bodily pain, is equally applicable to the diſtreſſes of the mind; and accordingly it is a common ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, to prepare us for the reception of good news by alarming our fears.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. Sympathetic emotion of virtue, and its cauſe.</head>
                  <p>ONE feeling there is, that merits a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate view, for its ſingularity, as well as utility. Whether to call it an emotion or a paſſion, ſeems uncertain. The former it can ſcarce be, becauſe it involves deſire; and the latter it can ſcarce be, becauſe it has no object. But this feeling and its nature will be beſt underſtood from examples. A ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal act of gratitude, produceth in the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor love or eſteem for the author. The ſpectator hath at the ſame time a ſeparate feeling; which, being mixed with love or eſteem, the capital emotion, hath not been much adverted to. It is a vague feeling of gratitude, which hath no object; but which, however, diſpoſes the ſpectator to acts of gratitude, more than upon ordinary occaſions. Let any man attentively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own heart when he thinks warmly of any ſignal act of gratitude, and he will be conſcious of this feeling, as diſtinct from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0258100201:82"/>
the eſteem or admiration he has for the grateful perſon. It merits our utmoſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by unfolding a curious piece of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm in the nature of man. The feeling is ſingular in the following reſpect, that it involves a deſire to perform acts of gratitude, without having any particular object; though in this ſtate the mind, wonderfully diſpoſed toward an object, neglects no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon which it can vent itſelf. Any act of kindneſs or good-will that would not be regarded upon another occaſion, is greedily ſeized; and the vague feeling is converted into a real paſſion of gratitude. In ſuch a ſtate, favours are returned double.</p>
                  <p>Again, a courageous action produceth in a ſpectator the paſſion of admiration direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the author. But beſide this well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known paſſion, a ſeparate feeling is raiſed in the ſpectator; which may be called <hi>an emotion of courage,</hi> becauſe while under its influence he is conſcious of a boldneſs and intrepidity beyond ordinary, and longs for proper objects upon which to exert this emotion.</p>

                  <p>For another example, let us figure ſome grand and heroic action, highly agreeable to the ſpectator. Beſide a ſingular venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the author, the ſpectator feels in himſelf an unuſual dignity of character, which diſpoſeth him to great and noble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And herein principally conſiſts the extreme delight every one hath in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of conquerors and heroes.</p>
                  <p>This ſingular feeling, which may be termed <hi>the ſympathetic emotion of virtue,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0258100201:84"/>
in one reſpect, the well-known ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites that lead to the propagation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſpecies. The appetites of hunger, thirſt, and animal love, ariſe in the mind without being directed upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular object; and in no caſe whatever is the mind more ſolicitous for a proper object, than when under the influence of any of theſe appetites.</p>
                  <p>The feeling I have endeavoured to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve, may well be termed <hi>the ſympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic emotion of virtue</hi>; for it is raiſed in a ſpectator by virtuous actions of every kind, and by no other ſort. When we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate a virtuous action, which never fails to delight us and to prompt our love for the author, the mind is warmed and put into a tone ſimilar to what inſpired the virtuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The propenſity we have to ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is ſo much enlivened, as to become for a time an actual emotion. But no man hath a propenſity to vice as ſuch. On the contrary, a wicked deed diſguſts him, and makes him abhor the author. This abhorrence is a ſtrong antidote ſo long as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0258100201:85"/>
any impreſſion remains of the wicked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>In a rough road, a halt to view a fine country is refreſhing; and here a delightful proſpect opens upon us. It is indeed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to ſee what incitements there are to virtue in the human frame. Juſtice is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be our duty, and it is guarded by natural puniſhments, from which the guilty never eſcape. To perform noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous actions, a warm ſenſe of dignity and ſuperior excellence is a moſt efficacious incitement<note n="*" place="bottom">See Eſſays upon morality and natural religion, part 1. eſſay 2. ch. 4.</note>. And to leave virtue in no quarter unſupported, here is unfolded an admirable contrivance, by which good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample commands the heart and adds to virtue the force of habit. Did our moral feelings extend no farther than to approve the action and to beſtow our affection on the author, good example would not have great influence. But to give it the utmoſt force, nothing can be better contrived than the ſympathetic emotion under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0258100201:86"/>
which prompts us to imitate what we admire. This ſingular emotion will readily find an object to exert itſelf upon; and at any rate, it never exiſts without producing ſome effect. Virtuous emotions of this ſort, are in ſome degree an exerciſe of virtue. They are a mental exerciſe at leaſt, if they ſhow not externally. And every exerciſe of virtue, internal and external, leads to habit; for a diſpoſition or propenſity of the mind, like a limb of the body, becomes ſtronger by exerciſe. Proper means, at the ſame time, being ever at hand to raiſe this ſympathetic emotion, its frequent reiteration may, in a good meaſure, ſupply the want of a more complete exerciſe. Thus, by proper diſcipline, every perſon may acquire a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled habit of virtue. Intercourſe with men of worth, hiſtories of generous and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted actions, and frequent meditation upon them, keep the ſympathetic emotion in conſtant exerciſe, which by degrees intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a habit, and confirms the authority of virtue. With reſpect to education in particular, what a ſpacious and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious avenue to the heart of a young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is here opened?</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV. In many inſtances one emotion is productive of another. The ſame of paſſions.</head>
                  <p>IN the firſt chapter it is obſerved, that the relations by which things are mutually connected, have a remarkable influence in regulating the train of our ideas. I here add, that they have an influence not leſs remarkable, in generating emotions and paſſions. Beginning with the former, it holds in fact, that an agreeable object makes every thing connected with it appear agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The mind gliding ſweetly and eaſily through related objects, carries along the beauty of objects that made a figure, and blends that beauty with the idea of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent object, which thereby appears more agreeable than when conſidered apart<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Such proneneſs has the mind to this communication of properties, that we often find properties aſcribed to a related object, of which naturally it is not ſuſceptible. Sir Richard Greenville in a ſingle ſhip being ſurpriſed by the Spaniſh fleet, was adviſed to retire. He utterly refuſed to turn from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; declaring, <q rend="inline">"he would rather die, than diſhonour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his country, and her Majeſty's ſhip." <bibl>Hakluyt, vol. 2. part 2. p. 169.</bibl>
                           </q>  To aid the communication of properties in ſuch inſtances, there always muſt be a momentary perſonifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. A ſhip muſt be imagined a ſenſible being, to make it ſuſceptible of honour or diſhonour. In the battle of Mantinea, Epaminondas being mortally wounded, was carried to his tent in a manner dead. Recovering his ſenſes, the firſt thing he inquired about was his ſhield; which being brought, he kiſſed it as the companion of his valour and glory. It muſt be remarked, that among the Greeks and Romans it was deemed infamous for a ſoldier to return from battle without his ſhield.</p>
                     </note>.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0258100201:88"/>
This reaſon may appear obſcure and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical, but it muſt be reliſhed when we attend to the following examples, which eſtabliſh the fact beyond all diſpute. No relation is more intimate than that betwixt a being and its qualities; and accordingly, the affection I bear a man expands itſelf readily upon all his qualities, which by that means make a greater figure in my mind than more ſubſtantial qualities in others. The talent of ſpeaking in a friend, is more regarded than that of acting in a perſon with whom I have no connection; and graceful motion in a miſtreſs, gives more delight than conſummate prudence in any other woman. Affection ſometimes riſes ſo high,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0258100201:89"/>
as to convert defects into properties. The wry neck of Alexander was imitated by his courtiers as a real beauty, without inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to flatter. Thus Lady Piercy, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her huſband Hotſpur,

                        <l>For thoſe who could ſpeak low and tardily,</l>
                        <l>Would turn their own perfection to abuſe,</l>

                  <p>When the paſſion of love has ended its courſe, its object becomes quite a different creature.—Nothing left of that genteel motion, that gaiety, that ſprightly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thoſe numberleſs graces, that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the lover's opinion, charmed all hearts.</p>
                  <p>The ſame communication of paſſion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0258100201:90"/>
in the relation of principal and acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Pride, of which ſelf is the object, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands itſelf upon a houſe, a garden, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, equipage, and every thing of that nature. A lover addreſſeth his miſtreſs's glove in the following terms:
<q>Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine.</q>
A temple is in a proper ſenſe an acceſſory of the deity to which it is dedicated. Diana is chaſte, and not only her temple, but the very iſicle which hangs on it, muſt partake of that property:
<q>
                        <l>The noble ſiſter of Poplicola,</l>
                        <l>The moon of Rome; chaſte as the iſicle</l>
                        <l>That's curdled by the froſt from pureſt ſnow,</l>
                        <l>And hangs on Dian's temple.</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it is, that the reſpect and eſteem, which the great, the powerful, the opulent naturally command, are in ſome meaſure communicated to their dreſs, to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to all their connections. It is this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0258100201:91"/>
principle, which in matters left to our own choice prevails over the natural taſte of beauty and propriety, and gives currency to what is called <hi>the faſhion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By means of the ſame eaſineſs of tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the bad qualities of an object are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along, and grafted upon related objects. Every good quality in a perſon is extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by hatred; and every bad quality is ſpread upon all his connections. A relation more ſlight and tranſitory than that of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, may have the ſame effect. Thus the bearer of bad tidings becomes an object of averſion:
<q>
                        <l>Fellow begone, I cannot brook thy ſight,</l>
                        <l>This news hath made thee a moſt ugly man.</l>

                  <p>This diſpoſition of the mind to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the properties of one object to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0258100201:92"/>
is not always proportioned to the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of their connection. The order of the tranſition from object to object, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an influence. The ſenſe of order ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates not leſs powerfully in this caſe, than in the ſucceſſion of ideas<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 1.</note>. If a thing be agreeable in itſelf, all its acceſſories appear agreeable. But the agreeableneſs of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory, extends not itſelf ſo readily to the principal. Any dreſs upon a fine woman is becoming; but the moſt elegant orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon one that is homely, have ſcarce any effect to mend her appearance. The reaſon will be obvious, from what is ſaid in the chapter above cited. The mind paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es more eaſily from the principal to its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſories, than in the oppoſite direction.</p>
                  <p>The emotions produced as above may properly be termed <hi>ſecondary,</hi> being occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned either by antecedent emotions or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent paſſions, which in this reſpect may be termed <hi>primary.</hi> And to complete the preſent theory, I muſt now remark a difference betwixt a primary emotion and a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0258100201:93"/>
primary paſſion in the production of ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary emotions. A ſecondary emotion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be more faint than the primary; and therefore, if the chief or principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject have not the power to raiſe a paſſion, the acceſſory object will have ſtill leſs power. But if a paſſion be raiſed by the principal object, the ſecondary emotion may readily ſwell into a paſſion for the acceſſory, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the acceſſory be a proper object for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. And thus it happens that one paſſion is often productive of another. Examples are without number: the ſole difficulty is a proper choice. I begin with ſelf-love, and the power it hath to generate other paſſions. The love which parents bear their children, is an illuſtrious example of the foregoing doctrine. Every man, beſide making part of a greater ſyſtem, like a comet, a planet, or ſatellite only; hath a leſs ſyſtem of his own, in the centre of which he repreſents the ſun diſperſing his fire and heat all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round. The connection between a man and his children, fundamentally that of cauſe and effect, becomes, by the addition of other circumſtances, the completeſt that can
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0258100201:94"/>
be among individuals; and therefore, ſelf-love, the moſt vigorous of all paſſions, is readily expanded upon children. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary emotion they at firſt produce by means of their connection, is, generally ſpeaking, ſufficiently ſtrong to move deſire even from the beginning; and the new paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſwells by degrees, till it rival in ſome meaſure ſelf-love, the primary paſſion. The following caſe will demonſtrate the truth of this theory. Remorſe for betraying a friend, or murdering an enemy in cold blood, makes a man even hate himſelf. In this ſtate, it is a matter of experience, that he is ſcarce conſcious of any affection to his children, but rather of diſguſt or ill-will. What cauſe can be aſſigned for this change, other than the hatred which beginning at himſelf, is expanded upon his children? And if ſo, may we not with equal reaſon derive from ſelf-love the affection a man for ordinary has to them?</p>
                  <p>The affection a man bears to his blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relations, depends on the ſame principle. Self-love is alſo expanded upon them; and the communicated paſſion, is more or leſs
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0258100201:95"/>
vigorous in proportion to the connection. Nor doth ſelf-love reſt here: it is, by the force of connection, communicated even to things inanimate. And hence the affection a man bears to his property, and to every thing he calls his own.</p>
                  <p>Friendſhip, leſs vigorous than ſelf-love, is, for that reaſon, leſs apt to communicate itſelf to children or other relations. Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces however are not wanting, of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated paſſion ariſing from friendſhip when it is ſtrong. Friendſhip may go higher in the matrimonial ſtate than in any other condition: and Otway, in <hi>Venice preſerv'd,</hi> ſhows a fine taſte in taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of that circumſtance. In the ſcene where Belvidera ſues to her father for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſhe is repreſented as pleading her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's merit, and the reſemblance ſhe bore to her mother.

generates in us good-will to his friends and ill-will to his enemies. Shakeſpear ſhows great art in the funeral oration pronounced by Antony over the body of Caeſar. He firſt endeavours to excite grief in the hearers, by dwelling upon the deplorable loſs of ſo great a man.

Had Antony directed upon the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors the thoughts of his audience, without paving the way by raiſing their grief, his ſpeech perhaps might have failed of ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>Hatred and other diſſocial paſſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce effects directly oppoſite to thoſe above mentioned. If I hate a man, his children, his relations, nay his property, become to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0258100201:99"/>
me objects of averſion. His enemies, on the other hand, I am diſpoſed to eſteem.</p>
                  <p>The more ſlight and tranſitory connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have generally no power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a communicated paſſion. Anger, when ſudden and violent, is one exception; for if the perſon who did the injury be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of reach, this paſſion will vent itſelf upon any related object, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſlight the relation be. Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception makes a greater figure. A group of beings or things, becomes often the object of a communicated paſſion, even where the relation of the individuals to the principal object is but faint. Thus though I put no value upon a ſingle man for living in the ſame town with myſelf; my townſmen however, conſidered in a body, are preferred before others. This is ſtill more remarkable with reſpect to my countrymen in general. The grandeur of the complex object, ſwells the paſſion of ſelf-love by the relation I have to my native country; and every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when it ſwells beyond its ordinary bounds, hath, in that circumſtance, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar tendency to expand itſelf along rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0258100201:100"/>
objects. In fact, inſtances are not rare, of perſons, who, upon all occaſions, are willing to ſacrifice their lives and fortunes for their country. Such influence upon the mind of man, hath a complex object, or, more properly ſpeaking, a general term<note n="*" place="bottom">See Eſſays on morality and natural religion, part 1. eſſ. 2. ch. 5.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſe of order hath, in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of paſſion, an influence not leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable than in the communication of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions. It is a common obſervation, that a man's affection to his parents is leſs vigorous than to his children. The order of nature in deſcending to children, aids the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of the affection. The aſcent to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, contrary to this order, makes the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition more difficult. Gratitude to a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor is readily extended to his children; but not ſo readily to his parents. The difference however betwixt the natural and inverted order, is not ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but that it may be balanced by other circumſtances. Pliny<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 7. cap. 36.</note> gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a woman of rank condemned
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0258100201:101"/>
to die for a crime; and, to avoid public ſhame, detained in priſon to die of hunger. Her life being prolonged beyond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was diſcovered, that ſhe was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by ſucking milk from the breaſts of her daughter. This inſtance of filial piety, which aided the tranſition and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent not leſs eaſy than deſcent is for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, procured a pardon to the mother, and a penſion to both. The ſtory of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drocles and the lion<note n="*" place="bottom">Aulus Gelliu, lib. 5. cap. 14.</note> may be accounted for in the ſame manner. The admiration, of which the lion was the cauſe, for his kindneſs and gratitude to Androcles, produced good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to Androcles, and pardon of his crime.</p>
                  <p>And this leads to other obſervations upon communicated paſſions. I love my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leſs after ſhe is married, and my mother leſs after a ſecond marriage. The marriage of my ſon or my father diminiſhes not my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſo remarkably. The ſame obſervation holds with reſpect to friendſhip, gratitude, and other paſſions. The love I bear my friend, is but faintly extended to his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried daughter. The reſentment I have
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0258100201:102"/>
againſt a man, is readily extended againſt children who make part of his family: not ſo readily againſt children who are forisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliated, eſpecially by marriage. This difference is alſo more remarkable in daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than in ſons. Theſe are curious facts; and to evolve the cauſe we muſt examine minutely, that operation of the mind by which a paſſion is extended to a related ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. In conſidering two things as related, the mind is not ſtationary, but paſſeth and repaſſeth from the one to the other, viewing the relation from each of them perhaps oftener than once. This holds more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in conſidering a relation betwixt things of unequal rank, as betwixt the cauſe and the effect, or betwixt a principal and an acceſſory. In contemplating the relation betwixt a building and its orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the mind is not ſatisfied with a ſingle tranſition from the former to the latter. It muſt alſo view the relation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the latter, and paſſing from it to the former. This vibration of the mind in paſſing and repaſſing betwixt things that are related, explains the facts above mentioned.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0258100201:103"/>
The mind paſſeth eaſily from the father to the daughter; but where the daughter is married, this new relation attracts the mind, and obſtructs, in ſome meaſure, the return from the daughter to the father. Any obſtruction the mind meets with in paſſing and repaſſing betwixt its objects, occaſions a like obſtruction in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of paſſion. The marriage of a male obſtructs leſs the eaſineſs of tranſition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a male is leſs ſunk by the relation of marriage than a female.</p>
                  <p>The foregoing inſtances, are of paſſion communicated from one object to another. But one paſſion may be generated by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, without change of object. It may in general be obſerved, that a paſſion paves the way to others, ſimilar in their tone, whether directed upon the ſame or upon a different object. For the mind heated by any paſſion, is, in that ſtate, more ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of a new impreſſion in a ſimilar tone, than when cool and quieſcent. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſervation, that pity generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth friendſhip for a perſon in diſtreſs.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0258100201:104"/>
Pity intereſts us in its object, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends all its virtuous qualities. For this reaſon, female beauty ſhows beſt in diſtreſs; and is more apt to inſpire love, than upon ordinary occaſions. But it is chiefly to be remarked, that pity, warming and melting the ſpectator, prepares him for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other tender affections; and pity is readily improved into love or friendſhip, by a certain tenderneſs and concern for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is the tone of both paſſions. The aptitude of pity to produce love is beautifully illuſtrated by Shakeſpear.

                  <p>FEar and anger, to anſwer the purpoſes of nature, are happily ſo contrived as to operate either inſtinctively or deliberately. So far as they prompt actions conſidered as means leading to a certain end, they fall in with the general ſyſtem, and require no particular explanation. If any object have a threatening appearance, reaſon ſuggeſts means to avoid the danger. If I am inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the firſt thing I think of, is in what manner I ſhall be revenged, and what means I ſhall employ. Theſe particulars are not leſs obvious than natural. But as the paſſions of fear and anger, ſo far as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive, are leſs familiar to us, and their nature generally not underſtood; I thought it would not be unacceptable to the reader
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0258100201:107"/>
to have them accurately delineated. He may alſo poſſibly reliſh the opportunity of this ſpecimen, to have the nature of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive paſſions more fully explained than there was formerly occaſion to do. I begin with fear.</p>
                  <p>Self-preſervation is to individuals a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of too great importance to be left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely under the guardianſhip of ſelf-love, which cannot be put in exerciſe otherwiſe than by the intervention of reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. Nature hath acted here with her uſual precaution and foreſight. Fear and anger are paſſions common to all men; and by operating inſtinctively, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently afford ſecurity when the ſlower o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of deliberative reaſon would be too late. We take nouriſhment commonly, not by the direction of reaſon, but by the incitement of hunger and thirſt. In the ſame manner, we avoid danger by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of fear, which often, before there is time for reflection, placeth us in ſafety. This matter then is ordered with conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate wiſdom. It is not within the reach of fancy, to conceive any thing better fitted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0258100201:108"/>
to anſwer its purpoſe, than this inſtinctive paſſion of fear, which, upon the firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of danger, operates inſtantaneouſly without reflection. So little doth the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in ſuch inſtances, depend on reaſon, that we often find it exerted even in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to reaſon, and when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that there is no hazard. A man who is not much upon his guard, cannot avoid ſhrinking at a blow, though he knows it to be aimed in ſport; nor cloſing his eyes at the approach of what may hurt them, though he is confident it will not come their length. Influenced by the ſame inſtinctive paſſion of fear, infants are much affected with a ſtern look, a menacing tone, or other expreſſion of anger; though, being incapable of reflection, they cannot form the ſlighteſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about the import of theſe ſigns. This is all that is neceſſary to be ſaid in general. The natural connection betwixt fear and the external ſigns of anger, will be handled in the chapter of the external ſigns of emotions and paſſions.</p>
                  <p>Fear provides for ſelf-preſervation by fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0258100201:109"/>
from harm; anger, by repelling it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indeed can be better contrived to repel or prevent injury, than anger or reſentment. Deſtitute of this paſſion, men, like defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs lambs, would lie conſtantly open to miſchief<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note>. Deliberate anger cauſed by a voluntary injury, is too well known to require any explanation. If my deſire be in general to reſent an afront, I muſt uſe means, and theſe means muſt be diſcovered by reflection. Deliberation is here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; and in this, which is the ordinary caſe, the paſſion ſeldom exceeds juſt bounds. But where anger ſuddenly inflames me to return a blow, the paſſion is inſtinctive, and the action ultimate; and it is chiefly in ſuch caſes that the paſſion is raſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable, becauſe it operates blindly, without affording time for reaſon or delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

Inſtinctive anger is frequently raiſed by bodily pain, which, when ſudden and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive as by a ſtroke on a tender part, ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling the temper and unhinging the mind, is in its tone ſimilar to anger. Bodily pain by this means diſpoſes to anger, which is as ſuddenly raiſed, provided an object be found to vent it upon. Anger commonly is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked otherwiſe than by a voluntary injury. But when a man is thus beforehand diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to anger, he is not nice nor ſcrupulous about an object. The man who gave the ſtroke, however accidentally, is by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable temper held a proper object, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he was the occaſion of the pain. It is ſtill a ſtronger example of the kind, that a ſtock or a ſtone, by which I am hurt, becomes an object for my reſentment. I am violently incited to bray it to atoms. The paſſion indeed in this caſe is but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary. It vaniſheth with the firſt reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being attended with no circumſtance that can excuſe it in any degree. Nor is this irrational effect confined to bodily pain. Inward diſtreſs, when exceſſive, may be the occaſion of effects equally irrational.

This blind and abſurd effect of anger, is more gaily illuſtrated by Addiſon, in a ſtory, the <hi>dramatis perſonae</hi> of which are a cardinal, and a ſpy retained in pay for intelligence. The cardinal is repreſented as minuting

The ſpy begins with a low voice, <q rend="inline">"Such an one the advocate whiſpered to one of his friends within my hearing, that your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence was a very great poltron;"</q> and after having given his patron time to take it down, adds,  <q rend="inline">"That another called him a mercenary raſcal in a public converſation."</q> The cardinal replies,  <q rend="inline">"Very well,"</q> and bids him go on.

                  <p>I have choſen to exhibit anger in its more rare appearances, for in theſe we can beſt trace its nature and extent. In the examples above given, it appears to be an abſurd paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and altogether irrational. But we ought to conſider, that it is not the intention of nature to ſubject this paſſion, in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to reaſon and reflection. It was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to prevent or to repel injuries; and, like fear, it often operates blindly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctively, without the leaſt view to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. The very firſt ſenſation of harm, ſets it in motion to repel injury by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Were it more cool and deliberate, it would loſe its threatening appearance, and be inſufficient to guard us againſt violence and miſchief. When ſuch is and ought to be the nature of the paſſion, it is not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to find it exerted irregularly and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciouſly, as it ſometimes is where the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0258100201:115"/>
is ſudden and unforeſeen. All the harm that can be done by the paſſion in this caſe, is inſtantaneous; for the ſhorteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay ſets all to rights; and circumſtances are ſeldom ſo unlucky as to put it in the power of a paſſionate man to do much harm in an inſtant.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI. Emotions cauſed by fiction.</head>
                  <p>THE attentive reader will obſerve, that in accounting for paſſions and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, no cauſe hitherto has been aſſigned but what hath a real exiſtence. Whether it be a being, action, or quality, that moveth us, it is ſuppoſed to be an object of our knowledge, or at leaſt of our belief. This obſervation diſcovers to us that the ſubject is not yet exhauſted; becauſe our paſſions, as all the world know, are moved by fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as by truth. In judging before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of man, ſo remarkably addicted to truth and reality, one ſhould little dream
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0258100201:116"/>
that fiction could have any effect upon him. But man's intellectual faculties are too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect to dive far even into his own nature. I ſhall take occaſion afterward to ſhow, that this branch of the human conſtitution, is contrived with admirable wiſdom and is ſubſervient to excellent purpoſes. In the mean time, I muſt endeavour to unfold, by what means fiction hath ſuch influence on the mind.</p>
                  <p>That the objects of our ſenſes really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in the way and manner we perceive, is a branch of intuitive knowledge. When I ſee a man walking, a tree growing, or cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grazing, I have a conviction that theſe things are preciſely as they appear. If I be a ſpectator of any tranſaction or event, I have a conviction of the real exiſtence of the perſons engaged, of their words, and of their actions. Nature determines us to rely on the veracity of our ſenſes. And indeed, if our ſenſes did not convince us of the reality of their objects, they could not in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree anſwer their end.</p>
                  <p>By the power of memory, a thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſeen may be recalled to the mind
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0258100201:117"/>
with different degrees of accuracy. We commonly are ſatisfied with a ſlight recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the chief circumſtances; and, in ſuch recollection, the thing is not figured as preſent nor any image formed. I retain the conſciouſneſs of my preſent ſituation, and barely remember that formerly I was a ſpectator. But with reſpect to an intereſting object or event which made a ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the mind ſometimes, not ſatisfied with a curſory review, chuſes to revolve every circumſtance. In this caſe, I conceive my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a ſpectator as I was originally; and I perceive every particular paſſing in my preſence, in the ſame manner as when I was in reality a ſpectator. For example, I ſaw yeſterday a beautiful woman in tears for the loſs of an only child, and was greatly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with her diſtreſs. Not ſatisfied with a ſlight recollection or bare remembrance, I inſiſt on the melancholy ſcene. Conceiving myſelf to be in the place where I was an eye-witneſs, every circumſtance appears to me as at firſt. I think I ſee the woman in tears and hear her moans. Hence it may be juſtly ſaid, that in a complete idea of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0258100201:118"/>
there is no paſt nor future. A thing recalled to the mind with the accuracy I have been deſcribing, is perceived as in our view, and conſequently as preſently exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Paſt time makes a part of an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete idea only: I remember or reflect, that ſome years ago I was at Oxford, and ſaw the firſt ſtone laid of the Ratcliff library; and I remember that at a ſtill greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, I heard a debate in the houſe of Commons about a ſtanding army.</p>
                  <p>Lamentable is the imperfection of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, almoſt in every particular that falls not under external ſenſe. I am talking of a matter exceeding clear in itſelf, and of which every perſon muſt be conſcious; and yet I find no ſmall difficulty to expreſs it clearly in words; for it is not accurate to talk of incidents long paſt as paſſing in our ſight, nor of hearing at preſent what we really heard yeſterday or perhaps a year ago. To this neceſſity I am reduced, by want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per words to deſcribe ideal preſence and to diſtinguiſh it from real preſence. And thus in the deſcription, a plain ſubject becomes obſcure and intricate. When I recall any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0258100201:119"/>
thing in the diſtincteſt manner, ſo as to form an idea or image of it as preſent; I have not words to deſcribe this act, other than that I perceive the thing as a ſpectator, and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in my preſence. This means not that I am really a ſpectator; but only that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive myſelf to be a ſpectator, and have a conſciouſneſs of preſence ſimilar to what a real ſpectator hath.</p>
                  <p>As many rules of criticiſm depend on ideal preſence, the reader, it is expected, will take ſome pains to form an exact notion of it, as diſtinguiſhed on the one hand from real preſence, and on the other from a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial or reflective remembrance. It is diſtinguiſhed from the former by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtance. Ideal preſence ariſing from an act of memory, may properly be termed <hi>a waking dream</hi>; becauſe, like a dream, it vaniſheth upon the firſt reflection of our preſent ſituation. Real preſence, on the contrary, vouched by eye-ſight, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our belief, not only during the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect perception, but in reflecting afterward upon the object. And to diſtinguiſh ideal preſence from the latter, I give the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0258100201:120"/>
illuſtration. Two internal acts, both of them exertions of memory, are clearly diſtinguiſhable. When I think of an event as paſt, without forming any image, it is barely reflecting or remembering that I was an eye-witneſs. But when I recall the event ſo diſtinctly as to form a complete image of it, I perceive it ideally as paſſing in my preſence; and this ideal perception is an act of intuition, into which reflection en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not more than into an act of ſight.</p>
                  <p>Though ideal preſence be diſtinguiſhed from real preſence on the one ſide and from reflective remembrance on the other, it is however variable without any preciſe limits; riſing ſometimes toward the former, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſinking toward the latter. In a vigorous exertion of memory, ideal preſence is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſtinct. When a man, as in a reverie, drops himſelf out of his thoughts, he perceives every thing as paſſing before him, and hath a conſciouſneſs of preſence ſimilar to that of a ſpectator. There is no other difference, but that in the former the conſciouſneſs of preſence is leſs firm and clear than in the latter. But this is ſeldom
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0258100201:121"/>
the caſe. Ideal preſence is often faint, and the image ſo obſcure as not to differ widely from reflective remembrance.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of an idea of memory. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider the idea of a thing I never ſaw, raiſed in me by ſpeech, by writing, or by painting. This idea, with reſpect to the preſent matter, is of the ſame nature with an idea of memory, being either complete or incomplete. An important event, by a lively and accurate deſcription, rouſes my attention and inſenſibly transforms me into a ſpectator: I perceive ideally every inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as paſſing in my preſence. On the other hand, a ſlight or ſuperficial narrative produceth only a faint and incomplete idea, preciſely ſimilar to a reflective recollection of memory. Of ſuch idea, ideal preſence makes no part. Paſt time is a circumſtance that enters into this idea, as it doth into a reflective idea of memory. I believe that Scipio exiſted about 2000 years ago, and that he overcame Hannibal in the famous battle of Zama. When I revolve in ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory a manner that memorable event, I conſider it as long paſt. But ſuppoſing me
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0258100201:122"/>
to be warmed with the ſtory, perhaps by a beautiful deſcription, I am inſenſibly transformed to a ſpectator. I perceive theſe two heroes in act to engage; I perceive them brandiſhing their ſwords, and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their troops; and in this manner I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them through every circumſtance of the battle. This event being preſent to my mind during the whole progreſs of my thoughts, admits not any time but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>I have had occaſion to obſerve<note n="*" place="bottom">Part 1. ſect. 1. of the preſent chapter.</note>, that ideas both of memory and of ſpeech, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce emotions of the ſame kind with what are produced by an immediate view of the object; only fainter, in proportion as an idea is fainter than an original perception. The inſight we have now got, unfolds the means by which this effect is produced. Ideal preſence ſupplies the want of real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and in idea we perceive perſons acting and ſuffering, preciſely as in an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſurvey. If our ſympathy be engaged by the latter, it muſt alſo in ſome meaſure
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0258100201:123"/>
be engaged by the former. The diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ideal preſence, as above mentioned, approacheth ſometimes to the diſtinctneſs of real preſence; and the conſciouſneſs of preſence is the ſame in both. This is the cauſe of the pleaſure that is felt in a reverie, where a man, loſing ſight of himſelf, is totally occupied with the objects paſſing in his mind, which he conceives to be really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in his preſence. The power of ſpeech to raiſe emotions, depends entirely on the artifice of raiſing ſuch lively and diſtinct images as are here deſcribed. The reader's paſſions are never ſenſibly moved, till he be thrown into a kind of reverie; in which ſtate, loſing the conſciouſneſs of ſelf, and of reading, his preſent occupation, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives every incident as paſſing in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, preciſely as if he were an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A general or reflective remembrance hath not this effect. It may be agreeable in ſome ſlight degree; but the ideas ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by it, are too faint and obſcure to raiſe any thing like a ſympathetic emotion. And were they ever ſo lively, they paſs with too much precipitation to have this

effect. Our emotions are never inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous: even thoſe that come the ſooneſt to perfection, have different periods of birth, growth, and maturity; and to give oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for theſe different periods, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the cauſe of every emotion be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the mind a due time. The emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is completed by reiterated impreſſions. We know this to be the caſe of objects of ſight: we are ſcarce ſenſible of any emotion in a quick ſucceſſion even of the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful objects. And if this hold in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of original perceptions, how much more in the ſucceſſion of ideas?</p>
                  <p>Though all this while, I have been only deſcribing what paſſeth in the mind of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one and what every one muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of, it was neceſſary to enlarge upon it; becauſe, however clear in the internal conception, it is far from being ſo when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in words. Ideal preſence, though of general importance, hath ſcarce ever been touched by any writer; and at any rate it could not be overlooked in account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the effects produced by fiction. Upon this point, the reader I gueſs has prevented me. It already muſt have occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0258100201:125"/>
to him, that if, in reading, ideal preſence be the means by which our paſſions are moved, it makes no difference whether the ſubject be a fable or a reality. When ideal preſence is complete, we perceive every object as in our ſight; and the mind, totally occupied with an intereſting event, finds no leiſure for reflection of any ſort. This reaſoning, if any one heſitate, is confirmed by conſtant and univerſal experience. Let us take under conſideration the meeting of Hector and Andromache in the ſixth book of the Iliad, or ſome of the paſſionate ſcenes in King Lear. Theſe pictures of human life, when we are ſufficiently engaged, give an impreſſion of reality not leſs diſtinct than that given by the death of Otho in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful deſcription of Tacitus. We never once reflect whether the ſtory be true or feigned. Reflection comes afterward, when we have the ſcene no longer before our eyes. This reaſoning will appear in a ſtill clearer light, by oppoſing ideal preſence to ideas raiſed by a curſory narrative; which ideas being faint, obſcure, and imperfect, occupy the mind ſo little as to ſolicit reflection. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0258100201:126"/>
a curt narrative of feigned inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents is never reliſhed. Any ſlight pleaſure it affords, is more than counterbalanced by the diſguſt it inſpires for want of truth.</p>
                  <p>In ſupport of the foregoing theory, I add what I reckon a deciſive argument. Upon examination it will be found, that genuine hiſtory commands our paſſions by means of ideal preſence ſolely; and therefore that with reſpect to this effect, genuine hiſtory ſtands upon the ſame footing with fable. To me it appears clear, that our ſympathy muſt vaniſh ſo ſoon as we begin to reflect upon the incidents related in either. The reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a ſtory is a pure fiction, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed prevent our ſympathy; but ſo will equally the reflection that the perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed are no longer exiſting. It is preſent diſtreſs only that moves my pity. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern vaniſhes with the diſtreſs; for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pity any perſon who at preſent is happy. According to this theory, founded clearly on human nature, a man long dead and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible now of paſt misfortunes, cannot move our pity more than if he had never exiſted. The misfortunes deſcribed in a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0258100201:127"/>
genuine hiſtory command our belief: but then we believe alſo, that theſe misfortunes are at an end, and that the perſons deſcribed are at preſent under no diſtreſs. What ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for example, can the belief of the rape of Lucretia have to raiſe our ſympathy, when ſhe died above 2000 years ago, and hath at preſent no painful feeling of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done her? The effect of hiſtory in point of inſtruction, depends in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon its veracity. But hiſtory cannot reach the heart, while we indulge any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the facts. Such reflection, if it engage our belief, never fails at the ſame time to poiſon our pleaſure, by convincing us that our ſympathy for thoſe who are dead and gone is abſurd. And if reflection be laid aſide, hiſtory ſtands upon the ſame footing with fable. What effect either of them may have to raiſe our ſympathy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the vivacity of the ideas they raiſe; and with reſpect to that circumſtance, fable is generally more ſucceſsful than hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Of all the means for making an impreſſion of ideal preſence, theatrical repreſentation is the moſt powerful. That words inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0258100201:128"/>
of action have the ſame power in a leſs degree, every one of ſenſibility muſt have felt: A good tragedy will extort tears in private, though not ſo forcibly as upon the ſtage. This power belongs alſo to painting. A good hiſtorical picture makes a deeper impreſſion than can be made by words, though not equal to what is made by theatrical action. And as ideal preſence depends on a lively impreſſion, painting ſeems to poſſeſs a middle place betwixt reading and acting. In making an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ideal preſence, it is not leſs ſuperior to the former than inferior to the latter.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not however be thought, that our paſſions can be raiſed by painting to ſuch a height as can be done by words. Of all the ſucceſſive incidents that concur to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a great event, a picture has the choice but of one, becauſe it is confined to a ſingle inſtant of time. And though the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it makes, is the deepeſt that can be made inſtantaneouſly; yet ſeldom can a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be raiſed to any height in an inſtant, or by a ſingle impreſſion. It was obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, that our paſſions, thoſe eſpecially of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0258100201:129"/>
the ſympathetic kind, require a ſucceſſion of impreſſions; and for that reaſon, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtill more acting have greatly the advantage, by the opportunity of reiterating impreſſions without end.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, it is by means of ideal preſence that our paſſions are excited; and till words produce that charm they avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Even real events intitled to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, muſt be conceived preſent and paſſing in our ſight before they can move us. And this theory ſerves to explain ſeveral pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena otherwiſe unaccountable. A misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune happening to a ſtranger, makes a leſs impreſſion than happening to a man we know, even where we are no way intereſted in him: our acquaintance with this man, however ſlight, aids the conception of his ſuffering in our preſence. For the ſame reaſon, we are little moved with any diſtant event; becauſe we have more difficulty to conceive it preſent, than an event that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in our neighbourhood.</p>
                  <p>Every one is ſenſible, that deſcribing a paſt event as preſent, has a fine effect in language. For what other reaſon than that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0258100201:130"/>
it aids the conception of ideal preſence? Take the following example.

In this paſſage we may obſerve how the writer inflamed with the ſubject, inſenſibly ſlips from the paſt time to the preſent; led to this form of narration by conceiving every circumſtance as paſſing in his own ſight. And this at the ſame time has a fine effect upon the reader, by advancing him to be as it were a ſpectator. But this change from the paſt to the preſent requires ſome preparation; and is not graceful in the ſame ſentence where there is no ſtop in the ſenſe; witneſs the following paſſage.

                  <p>It is wonderful to obſerve, upon what ſlender foundations nature, ſometimes, erects her moſt ſolid and magnificent works. In appearance at leaſt, what can be more ſlight than ideal preſence of objects? And yet upon it entirely is ſuperſtructed, that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive influence which language hath over the heart; an influence, which, more than any other means, ſtrengthens the bond of ſociety, and attracts individuals from their private ſyſtem to exert themſelves in acts of genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and benevolence. Matters of fact, it is true, and truth in general, may be inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without taking advantage of ideal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But without it, the fineſt ſpeaker or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0258100201:133"/>
writer would in vain attempt to move any of our paſſion: our ſympathy would be confined to objects that are really preſent: and language would loſe entirely that ſignal power it poſſeſſeth, of making us ſympathize with beings removed at the greateſt diſtance of time as well as of place. Nor is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of language, by means of this ideal preſence, confined to the heart. It reaches alſo in ſome meaſure the underſtanding, and contributes to belief. When events are related in a lively manner and every circumſtance appears as paſſing before us, it is with difficulty that we ſuffer the truth of the facts to be queſtioned. A hiſtorian accordingly who hath a genius for narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeldom fails to engage our belief. The ſame facts related in a manner cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct, are not ſuffered to paſs without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. A thing ill deſcribed, is like an object ſeen at a diſtance or through a miſt: we doubt whether it be a reality or a fiction. For this reaſon, a poet who can warm and animate his reader, may employ bolder fictions than ought to be ventured by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior genius. The reader, once thoroughly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0258100201:134"/>
engaged, is in that ſituation ſuſceptible of the ſtrongeſt impreſſions:

A maſterly painting has the ſame effect. Le Brun is no ſmall ſupport to Quintus Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius; and among the vulgar in Italy, the belief of ſcripture-hiſtory is perhaps founded as much upon the authority of Raphael, Michael Angelo, and other celebrated paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as upon that of the ſacred writers<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>In eſtabliſhing the foregoing theory, the reader has had the fatigue of much dry rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. But his labour will not be fruitleſs. From this theory are derived many uſeful rules in criticiſm, which ſhall be mentioned
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0258100201:135"/>
in their proper places. One ſpecimen, being a fine illuſtration, I chuſe to give at preſent. In a hiſtorical poem repreſenting human ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is a rule, that no improbable inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ought to be admitted. A circumſtance, an incident, or an event, may be ſingular, may ſurpriſe by being unexpected, and yet be extremely natural. The improbability I talk of, is that of an irregular fact, contrary to the order and courſe of nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unaccountable. A chain of imagined facts linked together according to the order of nature, find eaſy entrance into the mind; and if deſcribed with warmth of fancy, they produce complete images, including ideal preſence. But it is with great difficulty that we admit any irregular fact; for an irregular fact always puzzles the judgement. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of its reality we immediately enter upon reflection, and diſcovering the cheat, loſe all reliſh and concern. This is an unhappy effect; for thereafter it requires more than an ordinary effort, to reſtore the waking dream, and to make the reader conceive even the more probable incidents as paſſing in his preſence.</p>

                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0258100201:136"/>
I never was an admirer of machinery in an epic poem; and I now find my taſte ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by reaſon; the foregoing argument concluding ſtill more ſtrongly againſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary beings, than againſt improbable facts. Fictions of this nature may amuſe by their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty and ſingularity: but they never move the ſympathetic paſſions, becauſe they cannot impoſe on the mind any perception of reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I appeal to the diſcerning reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not preciſely the caſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery introduced by Taffo and by Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire. This machinery is not only in itſelf cold and unintereſting, but is remarkably hurtful, by giving an air of fiction to the whole compoſition. A burleſque poem, ſuch as the Lutrin or the Diſpenſary, may employ machinery with ſucceſs; for theſe poems, though they aſſume the air of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, give entertainment chiefly by their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ludicrous pictures, to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery contributes in a ſingular manner. It is not the aim of ſuch a poem, to raiſe our ſympathy in any conſiderable degree; and for that reaſon, a ſtrict imitation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not required. A poem profeſſedly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0258100201:137"/>
ludicrous, may employ machinery to great advantage; and the more extravagant the better. A juſt repreſentation of nature, would indeed be incongruous in a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intended to give entertainment by the means chiefly of ſingularity and ſurpriſe.</p>
                  <p>For accompliſhing the taſk undertaken in the beginning of the preſent ſection, what only remains is, to ſhow the final cauſe of the power that fiction hath over the mind of man. I have already mentioned, that language, by means of fiction, has the command of our ſympathy for the good of others. By the ſame means, our ſympathy may be alſo raiſed for our own good. In the third ſection it is obſerved, that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples both of virtue and of vice raiſe virtuous emotions; which becoming ſtronger by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, tend to make us virtuous by habit as well as by principle. I now further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that examples drawn from real events, are not ſo frequent as to contribute much to a habit of virtue. If they be, they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by hiſtorians. It therefore ſhows great wiſdom, to form us in ſuch a manner, as to be ſuſceptible of the ſame improvement
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0258100201:138"/>
from fable that we receive from genuine hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. By this admirable contrivance, examples to improve us in virtue may be multiplied without end. No other ſort of diſcipline contributes more to make virtue habitual; and no other ſort is ſo agreeable in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. I add another final cauſe with thorough ſatisfaction; becauſe it ſhows, that the author of our nature is not leſs kindly provident for the happineſs of his creatures, than for the regularity of their conduct. The power that fiction hath over the mind of man, is the ſource of an endleſs variety of refined amuſement, always ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a vacant hour. Such amuſement is a fine reſource in ſolitude; and by ſweeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the temper, improves ſociety.</p>

               <head>PART II. Emotions and paſſions as pleaſant and painful, agreeable and diſagreeable. Modifications of theſe qualities.</head>
               <p>IT will naturally occur at firſt view, that a diſcourſe upon the paſſions ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0258100201:139"/>
with explaining the qualities now mentioned. But upon trial, I found this could not be done diſtinctly, till the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were aſcertained betwixt an emotion and a paſſion, and till their cauſes were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved.</p>
               <p>Great obſcurity may be obſerved among writers with regard to the preſent point. No care, for example, is taken to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh agreeable from pleaſant, diſagreeable from painful; or rather theſe terms are deemed ſynonymous. This is an error not at all venial in the ſcience of ethics; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances can and ſhall be given, of painful paſſions that are agreeable, and of pleaſant paſſions that are diſagreeable. Theſe terms, it is true, are uſed indifferently in familiar converſations, and in compoſition for amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where accuracy is not required. But for thoſe to uſe them ſo who profeſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the paſſions, is a capital error. In writing upon the critical art, I would avoid every refinement that may ſeem more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than uſeful. But the proper meaning of the terms under conſideration muſt be aſcertained, in order to underſtand the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0258100201:140"/>
and ſome of their effects that are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with criticiſm.</p>
               <p>I ſhall endeavour to explain theſe terms by familiar examples. Viewing a fine garden, I perceive it to be beautiful or agreeable; and I conſider the beauty or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableneſs as belonging to the object, or as one of its qualities. Again, when I turn my thoughts from the garden to what paſſes in my mind, I am conſcious of a pleaſant emotion of which the garden is the cauſe. The pleaſure here is felt, not as a quality of the garden, but of the emotion produced by it. I give an oppoſite example. A rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carcaſs is loathſome and diſagreeable, and raiſes in the ſpectator a painful emotion. The diſagreeableneſs is a quality of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: the pain is a quality of the emotion produced by it. Agreeable and diſagreeable, then, are qualities of the objects we perceive: pleaſant and painful are qualities of the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we feel. The former qualities are perceived as adhering to objects; the latter are felt as exiſting within us.</p>
               <p>But a paſſion or emotion, beſide being felt, is frequently made an object of thought
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0258100201:141"/>
or reflection: we examine it; we inquire into its nature, its cauſe, and its effects. In this view it partakes the nature of other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: it is either agreeable or diſagreeable. Hence clearly appear the different ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the terms under conſideration, as applied to paſſion. When a paſſion is termed <hi>pleaſant</hi> or <hi>painful,</hi> we refer to the actual feeling: when termed <hi>agreeable</hi> or <hi>diſagreeable,</hi> it is conſidered as an object of thought or reflection. A paſſion is pleaſant or painful to the perſon in whom it exiſts: it is agreeable or diſagreeable to the perſon who makes it a ſubject of contemplation.</p>
               <p>When the terms thus defined are applied to particular emotions and paſſions, they do not always coincide. And in order to make this evident, we muſt endeavour to aſcertain, firſt, what paſſions and emotions are pleaſant what painful, and next, what are agreeable what diſagreeable. With reſpect to both, there are general rules, which, ſo far as I gather from induction, admit not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. The nature of an emotion or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as pleaſant or painful, depends entirely on its cauſe. An agreeable object produceth
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0258100201:142"/>
always a pleaſant emotion; and a diſagreeable object produceth always a painful emotion<note n="*" place="bottom">See part 7. of this chapter.</note>. Thus a lofty oak, a generous action, a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable diſcovery in art or ſcience, are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objects that unerringly produce pleaſant emotions. A ſtinking puddle, a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous action, an irregular ill-contrived edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, being diſagreeable objects, produce painful emotions. Selfiſh paſſions are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; for they ariſe from ſelf, an agreeable object or cauſe. A ſocial paſſion directed upon an agreeable object is always pleaſant: directed upon an object in diſtreſs, is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<note n="†" place="bottom">See the place above cited.</note>. Laſtly, all diſſocial paſſions, ſuch as envy, reſentment, malice, being cauſed by diſagreeable objects, cannot fail to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>It requires a greater compaſs to evolve the general rule that concerns the agreeableneſs or diſagreeableneſs of emotions and paſſions. An action conformable to the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our ſpecies, is perceived by us to be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0258100201:143"/>
regular and good<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſays on the principles of morality and natural religion, part 1. eſſ. 2. chap. 1.</note>; and conſequently eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch action appears agreeable to us. The ſame obſervation is applicable to paſſions and emotions. Every feeling that is conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the common nature of our ſpecies, is perceived by us to be regular and as it ought to be; and upon that account it muſt appear agreeable. By this general rule we can aſcertain what emotions are agreeable what diſagreeable. Every emotion that is conformable to the common nature of man, ought to appear agreeable. And that this holds true with reſpect to pleaſant emotions, will readily be admitted. But why ſhould painful emotions be an exception, when they are not leſs natural than the other? The propoſition holds true in both. Thus the painful emotion raiſed by a monſtrous birth or brutal action, is not leſs agreeable upon reflection, than the pleaſant emotion raiſed by a flowing river or a lofty dome. With reſpect to paſſions as oppoſed to emotions, it will be obvious from the foregoing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that their agreeableneſs or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0258100201:144"/>
like the actions of which they are productive, muſt be regulated entirely by the moral ſenſe. Every action vicious or improper is diſagreeable to a ſpectator, and ſo is the paſſion that prompts it. Every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion virtuous or proper is agreeable to a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, and ſo is the paſſion that prompts it.</p>
               <p>This deduction may be carried a great way farther; but to avoid intricacy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, I make but one other ſtep. A paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which, as aforeſaid, becomes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of thought to a ſpectator, may have the effect to produce a paſſion or emotion in him; for it is natural that a ſocial being ſhould be affected with the paſſions of others. Paſſions or emotions thus generated, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, in common with others, to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law above mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> that an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able object produces a pleaſant emotion, and a diſagreeable object a painful emotion. Thus the paſſion of gratitude, being to a ſpectator an agreeable object, produceth in him the pleaſant paſſion of love to the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon. Thus malice, being to a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator a diſagreeable object, produceth in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0258100201:145"/>
him the painful paſſion of hatred to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious perſon.</p>
               <p>We are now prepared for examples of pleaſant paſſions that are diſagreeable, and of painful paſſions that are agreeable. Self-love, ſo long as confined within juſt bounds, is a paſſion both pleaſant and agreeable. In exceſs it is diſagreeable, though it continues to be ſtill pleaſant. Our appetites are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in the ſame condition. Again, vanity, though pleaſant, is diſagreeable. Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the other hand, is, in every ſtage of the paſſion, painful; but is not diſagreeable unleſs in exceſs. Pity is always painful, yet always agreeable. But however diſtinct theſe qualities are, they coincide, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in one claſs of paſſions. All vicious paſſions tending to the hurt of others, are equally painful and diſagreeable.</p>
               <p>The foregoing diſtinctions among paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and emotions, may ſerve the common affairs of life, but they are not ſufficient for the critical art. The qualities of pleaſant and painful are too familiar to carry us far into human nature, or to form an accurate judgement in the fine arts. It is further
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0258100201:146"/>
neceſſary, that we be made acquainted with the ſeveral modifications of theſe qualities, with the modifications at leaſt that make the greateſt figure. Even at firſt view every one is ſenſible, that the pleaſure or pain of one paſſion differs from that of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. How diſtant the pleaſure of revenge from that of love? So diſtant, as that we cannot without reluctance admit them to be any way related. That the ſame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of pleaſure ſhould be ſo differently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified in different paſſions, will not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, when we reflect on the boundleſs variety of pleaſant ſounds, taſtes, and ſmells, daily felt. Our diſcernment reaches differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſtill more nice, in objects even of the ſame ſenſe. We have no difficulty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh different ſweets, different ſours, and different bitters. Honey is ſweet, and ſo is ſugar; and yet they never paſs the one for the other. Our ſenſe of ſmelling is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently acute, to diſtinguiſh varieties in ſweet-ſmelling flowers without end. With reſpect to paſſions and emotions, their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent feelings have no limits; for when we attempt the more delicate modifications,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0258100201:147"/>
they elude our ſearch, and are ſcarce diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible. In this matter, however, there is an analogy betwixt our internal and external ſenſes. The latter generally are ſufficiently acute for all the uſeful purpoſes of life, and ſo are the former. Some perſons indeed, Nature's favourites, have a wonderful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſs of ſenſe, which to them unfolds many a delightful ſcene totally hid from vulgar eyes. But if ſuch refined pleaſure be refuſed to the bulk of mankind, it is however wiſely ordered that they are not ſenſible of the defect; and it detracts not from their happineſs that others ſecretly are more happy. With relation to the fine arts only, this qualification ſeems eſſential; and there it is termed <hi>delicacy of taſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Should an author of ſuch a taſte attempt to deſcribe all thoſe differences and ſhades of pleaſant and painful emotions which he himſelf feels, he would ſoon meet an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible obſtacle in the poverty of language. No known tongue hitherto has reached ſuch perfection, as to expreſs clearly the more delicate feelings. A people muſt be thoroughly refined, before their language
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0258100201:148"/>
become ſo comprehenſive. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſt ſatisfied with an explanation of the more obvious modifications.</p>
               <p>In forming a compariſon betwixt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant paſſions of different kinds, we conceive ſome of them to be <hi>groſs</hi> ſome <hi>refined.</hi> Thoſe pleaſures of external ſenſe that are felt as at the organ of ſenſe, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be corporeal or groſs<note n="*" place="bottom">See the introduction.</note>. The pleaſures of the eye and ear are felt to be internal; and for that reaſon are conceived to be more pure and refined.</p>
               <p>The ſocial affections are conceived by all to be more refined than the ſelfiſh. Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and humanity are reckoned the fineſt temper of mind; and for that reaſon, the prevalence of the ſocial affections in the progreſs of ſociety, is held to be a refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our nature. A ſavage is unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for any pleaſure but what is thoroughly or nearly ſelfiſh: therefore a ſavage is incapable of comparing ſelfiſh and ſocial pleaſure. But a man after acquiring a high reliſh of the latter, loſes not thereby a taſte for the former. This man can judge, and he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0258100201:149"/>
will give preference to ſocial pleaſures as more ſweet and refined. In fact they maintain that character, not only in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect feeling, but alſo when we make them the ſubject of reflection. The ſocial paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are by far more agreeable than the ſelfiſh, and riſe much higher in our eſteem.</p>
               <p>Refined manners and polite behaviour, muſt not be deemed altogether artificial. Men accuſtomed to the ſweets of ſociety, who cultivate humanity, find an elegant pleaſure in preferring others and making them happy, of which the proud or ſelfiſh ſcarce have a conception.</p>
               <p>Ridicule, which chiefly ariſes from pride, a ſelfiſh paſſion, is at beſt but a groſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. A people, it is true, muſt have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged out of barbarity before they can have a taſte for ridicule. But it is too rough an entertainment for thoſe who are highly poliſhed and refined. Ridicule is baniſhed France, and is loſing ground daily in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>Other modifications of pleaſant paſſions will be occaſionally mentioned hereafter. Particularly the modifications of <hi>high</hi> and <hi>low</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0258100201:150"/>

               <head>PART III. Interrupted exiſtence of emotions and paſſions.—Their growth and decay.</head>
               <p>WEre emotions of the ſame nature with colour and figure, to continue in their preſent ſtate till varied by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating cauſe, the condition of man would be deplorable. It is ordered wiſely, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions ſhould more reſemble another attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of matter, <hi>viz.</hi> motion, which requires the conſtant exertion of an operating cauſe, and ceaſes when the cauſe is withdrawn. An emotion may ſubſiſt while its cauſe is preſent; and when its cauſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, may ſubſiſt by means of an idea, though in a fainter degree. But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment another thought breaks in and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies the mind, ſo as to exclude not only this cauſe, but alſo its idea, the emotion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0258100201:151"/>
is gone: it is no longer felt. If it return with its cauſe or idea, it again vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with them when other thoughts crowd in. This obſervation is applicable to emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and paſſions of every kind. And theſe accordingly are connected with perceptions and ideas, ſo intimately as not to have any independent exiſtence. A ſtrong paſſion, it is true, hath a mighty influence to detain its object in the mind; but not ſo as to detain it for ever. A ſucceſſion of perceptions or ideas is unavoidable<note n="*" place="bottom">See this point explained afterwards, chap. 9.</note>: the object of the paſſion may be often recalled; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intereſting, it muſt by intervals yield to other objects. For this reaſon, a paſſion rarely continues long with an equal degree of vigour. It is felt ſtrong and moderate, in a pretty quick ſucceſſion. The ſame object makes not always the ſame impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; becauſe the mind, being of a limited capacity, cannot, at the ſame inſtant, give great attention to a plurality of objects. The ſtrength of a paſſion depends on the impreſſion made by its cauſe; and a cauſe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0258100201:152"/>
makes its ſtrongeſt impreſſion, when hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to be the ſingle intereſting object, it attracts our whole attention<note n="*" place="bottom">See the appendix, containing definitions and explanation of terms, ſect. 33.</note>. Its impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſlighter when our attention is divided betwixt it and other objects; and at that time the paſſion is ſlighter in proportion.</p>
               <p>When emotions and paſſions are felt thus by intervals and have not a continued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, it may be thought a nice problem, to aſcertain their identity, and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine when they are the ſame when differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. In a ſtrict philoſophic view, every ſingle impreſſion made even by the ſame object, is diſtinguiſhable from what have gone before, and from what ſucceed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is an emotion raiſed by an idea the ſame with what is raiſed by a ſight of the object. But ſuch accuracy is not found in common apprehenſion, nor is neceſſary in common language. The emotions raiſed by a fine landſcape in its ſucceſſive appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are not diſtinguiſhed from each other, nor even from thoſe raiſed by ſucceſſive
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0258100201:153"/>
ideas of the object: all of them are held to be the ſame. A paſſion alſo is always rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the ſame, ſo long as it is fixed upon the ſame object. Thus love and hatred may continue the ſame for life. Nay, ſo looſe are we in this way of thinking, that many paſſions are reckoned the ſame even after a change of object. This is the caſe of all paſſions that proceed from ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar propenſity. Envy, for example, is conſidered to be the ſame paſſion, not only while it is directed upon the ſame perſon, but even where it comprehends many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at once. Pride and malice are in the ſame condition. So much was neceſſary to be ſaid upon the identity of a paſſion and emotion, in order to prepare for examining their growth and decay.</p>
               <p>The growth and decay of paſſions and emotions, is a ſubject too extenſive to be exhauſted in an undertaking like the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. I pretend only to give a curſory view of it, ſo far as neceſſary for the purpoſes of criticiſm. Some emotions are produced in their utmoſt perfection, and have a very ſhort endurance. This is the caſe of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0258100201:154"/>
of wonder, and ſometimes of terror. Emotions raiſed by inſenſible objects, ſuch as trees, rivers, buildings, pictures, arrive at perfection almoſt inſtantaneouſly, and have a long endurance: a ſecond view pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth nearly the ſame pleaſure with the firſt. Love, hatred, and ſome other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, increaſe gradually to a certain pitch, and thereafter decay gradually. Envy, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, pride, ſcarce ever decay. Again, ſome paſſions, ſuch as gratitude and revenge, are often exhauſted by a ſingle act of gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Other paſſions, ſuch as pride, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, envy, love, hatred, are not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; but having a long continuance, demand frequent gratification.</p>
               <p>In order to explain theſe differences, it would be an endleſs work to examine every emotion and paſſion in particular. We muſt be ſatisfied at preſent with ſome general views. And with reſpect to emotions, which are quieſcent and not productive of deſire, their growth and decay are eaſily explained. An emotion cauſed by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal object, cannot naturally take longer time to arrive at perfection, than is neceſſary for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0258100201:155"/>
a leiſurely ſurvey. Such emotion alſo muſt continue long ſtationary, without any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decay; a ſecond or third view of the object being nearly as agreeable as the firſt. This is the caſe of an emotion produced by a fine proſpect, an impetuous river, or a towering hill. While a man remains the ſame, ſuch objects ought to have the ſame effect upon him. Familiarity, however, hath an influence here, as it hath every where. Frequency of view, after ſhort intervals eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, weans the mind gradually from the object, which at laſt loſes all reliſh. The nobleſt object in the material world, a clear and ſerene ſky, is quite diſregarded, unleſs perhaps after a courſe of bad weather. An emotion raiſed by human virtues, qualities, or actions, may grow imperceptibly by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated views of the object, till it become ſo vigorous as to generate deſire. In this condition it muſt be handled as a paſſion.</p>
               <p>As to paſſion, I obſerve firſt, that when nature requires a paſſion to be ſudden, it is commonly produced in perfection. This is frequently the caſe of fear and of anger. Wonder and ſurpriſe are always produced
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0258100201:156"/>
in perfection. Reiterated impreſſions made by their cauſe, exhauſt theſe paſſions in place of inflaming them. This will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained afterward<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 6.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the next place, when a paſſion hath for its foundation an original propenſity pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to ſome men, it generally comes ſoon to perfection. The propenſity, upon repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting a proper object, is immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened into a paſſion. This is the caſe of pride, of envy, and of malice.</p>
               <p>In the third place, love and hatred have often a ſlow growth. The good qualities or kind offices of a perſon, raiſe in me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant emotions; which, by reiterated views, are ſwelled into a paſſion involving deſire of that perſon's happineſs. This deſire being often put in exerciſe, works gradually a change internally; and at laſt produceth in me a ſettled habit of affection for that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, now my friend. Affection thus produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, operates preciſely like an original pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity. To enliven it into a paſſion, no more is required but the real or ideal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0258100201:157"/>
of the object. The habit of averſion or hatred is brought on in the ſame manner. And here I muſt obſerve by the way, that love and hatred ſignify commonly affection, not paſſion. The bulk indeed of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are theſe affections inflamed into a paſſion by different circumſtances. The affection of love I bear to my ſon, is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the paſſion of fear, when he is in danger; becomes hope, when he hath a proſpect of good fortune; becomes admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he performs a laudable action; and ſhame, when he commits any wrong. Averſion, again, becomes fear when there is a proſpect of good fortune to my enemy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes hope when he is in danger; becomes joy when he is in diſtreſs; and ſorrow when a laudable action is performed by him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the growth of ſome paſſions depends often on occaſional circumſtances. Obſtacles to gratification never fail to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and inflame a paſſion. A conſtant endeavour to remove the obſtacle, preſerves the object of the paſſion ever in view, which ſwells the paſſion by impreſſions frequently reiterated. Thus the reſtraint of conſcience,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0258100201:158"/>
when an obſtacle to love, agitates the mind and inflames the paſſion:
<q>
                     <l>Quod licet, ingratum eſt: quod non licet, acrius urit.</l>
                     <l>Si nunquam Danaën habuiſſet ahenea turris,</l>
                     <l>Non eſſet Danaë de Jove facta parens.</l>
                     <bibl>Ovid. Amor. l. 2.</bibl>
                  </q>
At the ſame time, the mind diſtreſſed with the obſtacle, is diſpoſed to indulge its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs by magnifying the pleaſure of gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; which naturally inflames deſire. Shakeſpear expreſſes this obſervation finely:
<q>
                     <l>All impediments in fancy's courſe,</l>
                     <l>Are motives of more fancy.</l>
                  </q>
We need no better example than a lover who hath many rivals. Even the caprices of a miſtreſs have the effect to inflame love. Theſe occaſioning uncertainty of ſucceſs, tend naturally to make the anxious lover overvalue the happineſs of fruition.</p>
               <p>So much upon the growth of paſſions. Their continuance and decay come next under conſideration. And firſt, it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0258100201:159"/>
law of nature, that things ſudden in their growth, are equally ſudden in their decay. This is commonly the caſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and with reſpect to wonder and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, another reaſon concurs, that their cauſes are of ſhort duration. Novelty ſoon degenerates into familiarity; and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedneſs of an object, is ſoon ſunk in the pleaſure which the object affords us. Fear, which is a paſſion of greater import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as tending to ſelf-preſervation, is often inſtantaneous, and yet is of equal duration with its cauſe. Nay it frequently ſubſiſts after the cauſe is removed.</p>
               <p>In the next place, a paſſion founded on a peculiar propenſity, ſubſiſts generally for ever. This is the caſe of pride, envy, and malice. Objects are never wanting, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the propenſity into a paſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it may be laid down as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law of nature, that every paſſion ceaſes upon attaining its ultimate end. To explain this law, we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and a general end. I call a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar end what may be accompliſhed by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle act. A general end, on the contrary,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0258100201:160"/>
admits acts without number; becauſe it cannot be ſaid that a general end is ever fully accompliſhed while the object of the paſſion ſubſiſts. Gratitude and revenge are examples of the firſt kind. The ends they aim at may be accompliſhed by a ſingle act; and when this act is performed, the paſſions are neceſſarily at an end. Love and hatred are examples of the other kind. The deſire of doing good or of doing miſchief to an individual, is a general end, which admits acts without number, and which ſeldom is fully accompliſhed. Therefore theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have frequently the ſame duration with their objects.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it will afford us another general view, to conſider the difference betwixt an original propenſity and an affection produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by cuſtom. The former adheres too cloſe to the conſtitution ever to be eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and for that reaſon the paſſions to which it gives birth, endure during life with no remarkable diminution of ſtrength. The latter, which owes its birth and increment to time, owes its decay to the ſame cauſe. Affection decays gradually as it grew. Hence long
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0258100201:161"/>
abſence extinguiſheth hatred as well as love. Affection wears out more gradually betwixt perſons, who, living together, are objects to each other of mutual good-will and kindneſs. But here habit comes in luckily, to ſupply decayed affection. It makes theſe perſons neceſſary to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of each other, by the pain of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 14.</note>. Affection to children hath a long endurance, longer perhaps than any other affection. Its growth keeps pace with that of its objects. They diſplay new beauties and qualifications daily, to feed and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the affection. But whenever the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection becomes ſtationary, it muſt begin to decay; with a ſlow pace indeed, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its increment. In ſhort, man with reſpect to this life, is a temporary being. He grows, becomes ſtationary, decays; and ſo muſt all his powers and paſſions.</p>

               <p>TO have a thorough knowledge of the human paſſions and emotions, it is not ſufficient that they be examined ſingly and ſeparately. As a plurality of them are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times felt at the ſame inſtant, the manner of their coexiſtence, and the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by produced, ought alſo to be examined. This ſubject is extenſive, and it will be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to evolve all the laws that govern its endleſs variety of caſes. Such an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king may be brought to perfection, but it muſt be by degrees. The following hints may ſuffice for a firſt attempt.</p>
               <p>We begin with emotions raiſed by different ſounds, as the ſimpleſt caſe. Two ſounds that mix, and are, as it were, incorporated before they reach the ear, are ſaid to be concordant. That each ſound produceth an emotion of its own, muſt be admitted. But then theſe emotions, like the ſounds
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0258100201:163"/>
that produce them, mix ſo intimately, as to be rather one complex emotion than two emotions in conjunction. Two ſounds, again, that refuſe incorporation or mixture, are ſaid to be diſcordant. Being however heard at the ſame inſtant, the emotions produced by them are conjoined; and in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are unpleaſant, even where ſeparately they are each of them pleaſant.</p>
               <p>Similar to the emotion raiſed by mixed ſounds, is the emotion that an object of ſight raiſes by means of its ſeveral qualities. A tree, for example, with its qualities of colour, figure, ſize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is perceived to be one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and the emotion it raiſes is one, not different emotions combined. But though the emotion be one, it is however not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The perception of the tree is complex, and the emotion raiſed by it muſt alſo be complex.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to coexiſtent emotions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by different cauſes or objects, it muſt be obſerved, that there cannot be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance among objects of ſight like what is perceived in ſounds. Objects of ſight are never mixed or incorporated in the act of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0258100201:164"/>
viſion. Each object is perceived as it exiſts, ſeparately from others; and each raiſeth its own emotion, which is felt diſtinctly how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intimately connected the objects may be. This doctrine holds in all the cauſes of emotion or paſſion, ſounds only excepted.</p>
               <p>To explain the manner in which ſuch emotions coexiſt, ſimilar emotions muſt be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are diſſimilar. Two emotions are ſaid to be ſimilar, when they tend each of them to produce the ſame tone of mind. Chearful emotions, however different their cauſes may be, are ſimilar; and ſo are thoſe which are melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. Diſſimilar emotions are eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by their oppoſition to what are ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Grandeur and littleneſs, gaiety and gloomineſs, are diſſimilar emotions.</p>
               <p>Emotions perfectly ſimilar, readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine and unite<note n="*" place="bottom">It is eaſier to conceive the manner of coexiſtence of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar emotions, than to deſcribe it. They cannot be ſaid to mix or incorporate like concordant ſounds. Their union is rather of agreement or concord; and therefore I have choſen the words in the text, not as ſufficient to expreſs clearly the manner of their coexiſtence, but only as leſs liable to excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than any other I can find.</note>, ſo as in a manner to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0258100201:165"/>
one complex emotion; witneſs the emotions produced by a number of flowers in a parterre, or of trees in a wood. Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions again that are oppoſite or extremely diſſimilar, never combine nor unite. The mind cannot ſimultaneouſly take on oppoſite tones: it cannot at the ſame inſtant be both joyful and ſad, angry and ſatisfied, proud and humble. Diſſimilar emotions may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed each other with rapidity, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt ſimultaneouſly.</p>
               <p>Betwixt theſe two extremes, emotions will unite more or leſs, in proportion to the degree of their reſemblance and the greater or leſs connection of their cauſes. The beauty of a landſcape and the ſinging of birds, produce emotions that are ſimilar in a conſiderable degree; and theſe emotions therefore, though proceeding from very different cauſes, readily combine and unite. On the other hand, when the cauſes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately connected, the emotions, though but ſlightly reſembling each other, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a ſort of union. I give for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample a miſtreſs in diſtreſs. When I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her beauty, I feel a pleaſant emotion;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0258100201:166"/>
and a painful emotion when I conſider her diſtreſs. Theſe two emotions, proceeding from different views of the object, have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little reſemblance to each other: and yet their cauſes are ſo intimately connected, as to force them into a ſort of complex emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, partly pleaſant partly painful. This clearly explains ſome expreſſions common in poetry, <hi>a ſweet diſtreſs, a pleaſant pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We proceed to the effects produced by means of the different manners of coexiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence above deſcribed; firſt, the effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced within the mind, and next, thoſe that appear externally. I diſcover two mental effects clearly diſtinguiſhable from each other. The one may be repreſented by addition and ſubtraction in numbers, and the other by harmony in ſounds. Two pleaſant emotions that are ſimilar, readily unite when they are coexiſtent; and the pleaſure felt in the union, is the ſum of the two pleaſures. The combined emotions are like multiplied effects from the co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of different powers. The ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in ſucceſſion, are far from making the ſame figure; becauſe the mind at no
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0258100201:167"/>
inſtant of the ſucceſſion is conſcious of more than a ſingle emotion. This doctrine may aptly be illuſtrated by a landſcape com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending hills, vallies, plains, rivers, trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The emotions produced by theſe ſeveral objects, being ſimilar in a high degree as falling in eaſily and ſweetly with the ſame tone of mind, are in conjunction extremely pleaſant. And this multiplied effect is felt from objects even of different ſenſes; as where a landſcape is conjoined with the muſic of birds and odor of flowers. Such multiplied effect, as above hinted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends partly on the reſemblance of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and partly on the connection of their cauſes; whence it follows, that the effect muſt be the greateſt, where the cauſes are intimately connected and the emotions perfectly ſimilar.</p>
               <p>The other pleaſure ariſing from coexiſtent emotions, which may be termed <hi>the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of concord or harmony,</hi> is aſcertained by a different rule. It is directly in proportion to the degree of reſemblance betwixt the emotions, and inverſely in proportion to the degree of connection betwixt the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0258100201:168"/>
To feel this pleaſure in perfection, the reſemblance cannot be too ſtrong, nor the connection too ſlight. Where the cauſes are intimately connected, the ſimilar emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they produce are felt like one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex emotion. But the pleaſure of harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is not felt from one emotion ſingle or complex. It is felt from various ſimilar e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, diſtinct from each other, and yet ſweetly combining in the mind; and the leſs connection the cauſes have, the more entire is the emotion of harmony. This matter cannot be better illuſtrated, than by the foregoing example of a landſcape, where the ſight, hearing, and ſmelling, are employed. The accumulated pleaſure of ſo many different ſimilar emotions, is not what delights us the moſt in this combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of objects. The ſenſe of harmony from theſe emotions ſweetly uniting in the mind, is ſtill more delightful. We feel this harmony in the different emotions proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the viſible objects; but we feel it ſtill more ſenſibly in the emotions proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the objects of different ſenſes. This emotion of concord or harmony, will
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0258100201:169"/>
be more fully illuſtrated, when the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions produced by the ſound of words and their meaning are taken under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 18. ſect. 3.</note>.</p>
               <p>This emotion of concord from conjoined emotions, is felt even where the emotions are not perfectly ſimilar. Love is a pleaſant paſſion; but then its ſweetneſs and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs make it reſemble in a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the painful paſſion of pity or grief; and for that reaſon, love accords better with theſe paſſions than with what are gay and ſprightly. I give the following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from Catullus, where the concord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt love and grief, has a fine effect even in ſo ſlight a ſubject as the death of a ſparrow.

               </p>
               <p>To complete this branch of the ſubject, I proceed to conſider the effects of diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar emotions. Theſe effects obviouſly muſt be oppoſite to what are above deſcribed; and in order to explain them with accuracy, diſſimilar emotions proceeding from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected cauſes, muſt be diſtinguiſhed from what proceed from cauſes that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected. Diſſimilar emotions of the former kind, being forced into a ſort of unnatural union, produce a feeling of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord inſtead of harmony. It holds alſo that in computing their force, ſubtraction muſt be uſed in place of addition, which will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what follows. Diſſimilar emotions forced into union, are felt obſcurely and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0258100201:171"/>
for each tends to vary the tone of mind that is ſuited to the other; and the mind thus diſtracted betwixt two objects, is at no inſtant in a condition to receive a full impreſſion from either. Diſſimilar e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions proceeding from unconnected cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are in a very different condition. Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar emotions in general are averſe to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and as there is nothing to force them into union when their cauſes are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, emotions of this kind are never felt but in ſucceſſion. By that means, they are not felt to be diſcordant, and each hath an opportunity to make a full impreſſion.</p>
               <p>This curious theory muſt be illuſtrated by examples. In reading the deſcription of the diſmal waſte, book 1. of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> we are ſenſible of a confuſed feeling, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from diſſimilar emotions forced into union, <hi>viz.</hi> the beauty of the deſcription and the horror of the object deſcribed.
<q>
                     <l>Seeſt thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,</l>
                     <l>The ſeat of deſolation, void of light,</l>
                     <l>Save what the glimmering of theſe livid flames</l>
                     <l>Caſts pale and dreadful?</l>

Many other paſſages in this juſtly celebrated poem produce the ſame effect; and we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerve, that if the diſagreeableneſs of the ſubject be obſcured by the beautiful deſcription, this beauty is not leſs obſcured by its diſcordant union with the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the ſubject. For the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, aſcending ſmoke in a calm morning is improper in a picture full of violent action. The emotion of ſtillneſs and tranquillity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the former, accords not with the lively and animated emotion inſpired by the latter. A parterre, partly ornamented partly in diſorder, produces a mixt feeling of the ſame ſort. Two great armies in act to engage, mix the diſſimilar emotions of grandeur and of terror.

A virtuous man has drawn on himſelf a great misfortune, by a fault incident to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and therefore venial. The remorſe he feels aggravates his diſtreſs, and conſequently raiſes our pity to a high pitch. We indeed blame the man; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation raiſed by the fault he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, is diſſimilar to pity. Theſe two paſſions however proceeding from different views of the ſame object, are forced into a ſort of union. But the indignation is ſo ſlight as ſcarce to be felt in the mixture with pity. Subjects of this kind, are of all the fitteſt for tragedy. But of this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. of epic and dramatic compoſitions.</note>.</p>

Oppoſite emotions are ſo diſſimilar as not to admit any ſort of union, even where they proceed from cauſes the moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected. Love to a miſtreſs, and reſentment for her infidelity, are of this nature. They cannot exiſt otherwiſe than in ſucceſſion, which by the connection of their cauſes is commonly rapid. And theſe emotions will govern alternately, till one of them obtain the aſcendent, or both be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated. A ſucceſſion opens to me by the death of a worthy man, who was my friend as well as my kinſman. When I think of my friend I am grieved; but the ſucceſſion gives me joy. Theſe two cauſes are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected, for the ſucceſſion is the direct conſequence of my friend's death. The emotions however being oppoſite, do not mix: they prevail alternately, perhaps for a courſe of time, till grief for my friend's death be baniſhed by the pleaſures of opulence. A virtuous man ſuffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, is an example of the ſame kind. I pity him, and I have great indignation at the author of the wrong. Theſe emotions proceed from cauſes nearly connected; but being directed upon different objects, they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0258100201:175"/>
are not forced into union. The oppoſition preſerves them diſtinct; and accordingly they are found to govern alternately, the one ſometimes prevailing and ſometimes the other.</p>
               <p>Next of diſſimilar emotions ariſing from unconnected cauſes. Good and bad news of equal importance arriving at the ſame inſtant from different quarters, produce op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite emotions, the diſcordance of which is not felt becauſe they are not forced into union. They govern alternately, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in a quick ſucceſſion, till their force be ſpent. In the ſame manner, good news arriving to a man labouring under diſtreſs, occaſions a vibration in his mind from the one to the other.

If the emotions be unequal in force, the ſtronger after a conflict will extinguiſh the weaker. Thus the loſs of a houſe by fire or of a ſum of money by bankruptcy, will make no figure in oppoſition to the birth of a long-expected ſon, who is to inherit an opulent fortune. After ſome ſlight vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the mind ſettles in joy, and the loſs is forgot.</p>
               <p>The foregoing obſervations, will be found of great uſe in the fine arts. Many practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal rules are derived from them, which I
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0258100201:177"/>
ſhall have occaſion afterward to mention. For inſtant ſatisfaction in part, I propoſe to ſhow the uſe of theſe obſervations in muſic, a theme I inſiſt upon at preſent, not being certain of another opportunity more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It will be admitted, that no combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſounds but what is agreeable to the ear, is intitled to the name of muſic. Melody and harmony are ſeparately agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and in union delightful. The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of vocal muſic differs from that of inſtrumental. The former being intended to accompany words, ought to be expreſſive of the ſentiment that is conveyed by the words. But the latter having no connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with words, may be agreeable without expreſſing any ſentiment. Harmony pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, though delightful when in perfection, is not expreſſive of ſentiment; and we often find good melody without the leaſt tincture of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe preliminaries being eſtabliſhed, I proceed directly to the point. In vocal mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, the intimate connection of ſenſe and ſound rejects diſſimilar emotions, thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that are oppoſite. Similar emotions
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0258100201:178"/>
produced by the ſenſe and ſound go natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally into union; and at the ſame time are felt to be concordant or harmonious. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar emotions, on the other hand, forced into union by cauſes intimately connected, not only obſcure each other, but are alſo unpleaſant by diſcordance. From theſe principles it is eaſy to ſay what ſort of poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical compoſitions are fitted for muſic. It is evident that no poem expreſſing the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of any diſagreeable paſſion is proper. The pain a man feels who is actuated with malice or unjuſt revenge, diſqualifies him for reliſhing muſic or any thing that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining. And ſuppoſing him diſpoſed, againſt nature, to vent his ſentiments in muſic, the mixture would be unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; for theſe paſſions raiſe diſguſt and averſion in the audience<note n="*" place="bottom">See part 2. of the preſent chapter, toward the cloſe.</note>, a tone of mind oppoſite to every emotion that muſic can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire. A man ſeized with remorſe cannot bear muſic, becauſe every ſort of it muſt be diſcordant with his tone of mind; and when theſe by an unſkilful artiſt are forced into
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0258100201:179"/>
union, the mixture is unpleaſant to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>In general, muſic never can have a good effect in conjunction with any compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition expreſſive of malice, envy, peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any other diſſocial paſſion. The pleaſure of muſic, on the other hand, is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to all pleaſant emotions; and muſic is finely qualified for every ſong where ſuch emotions are expreſſed. Muſic particularly in a chearful tone, is concordant in the higheſt degree with every emotion in the ſame tone; and hence our taſte for chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful airs expreſſive of mirth and jollity. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic is peculiarly well qualified for accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every ſympathetic emotion. Sympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic joy aſſociates finely with chearful muſic, and ſympathetic pain not leſs finely with muſic that is tender and melancholy. All the different emotions of love, <hi>viz.</hi> tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, concern, anxiety, pain of abſence, hope, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> accord delightfully with muſic. A perſon in love, even when unkindly treated, is ſoothed by muſic. The tenderneſs of love ſtill prevailing, accords with a melancholy ſtrain. This
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0258100201:180"/>
is finely exemplified by Shakeſpear in the fourth act of <hi>Othello,</hi> where Deſdemona calls for a ſong expreſſive of her diſtreſs. Wonderful is the delicacy of that writer's taſte, which fails him not even in the moſt refined emotions of human nature. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy muſic again is ſuitable to ſlight grief, which requires or admits conſolation. But deep grief, which refuſes all conſolation, rejects for that reaſon even melancholy mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic. For a different reaſon, muſic is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for accompanying pleaſant emotions of the more important kind. Theſe totally ingroſs the mind, and leave no place for muſic or any ſort of amuſement. In a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous enterpriſe to dethrone a tyrant, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic would be impertinent, even where hope prevails, and the proſpect of ſucceſs is great. Alexander attacking the Indian town and mounting the wall, had certainly no impulſe to exert his proweſs in a ſong. It is true, that not the leaſt regard is paid to theſe rules ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the French or Italian opera; and the attachment we have to theſe compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may at firſt ſight be conſidered as a proof that the foregoing doctrine cannot be founded on human nature. But the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0258100201:181"/>
taſte for operas is at bottom no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt me. In our operas the paſſions are ſo imperfectly expreſſed, as to leave the mind free for reliſhing muſic of any ſort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently. It cannot be diſguiſed, that the pleaſure of an opera is derived chiefly from the muſic, and ſcarce at all from the ſentiments. A happy coincidence of emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions raiſed by the ſong and by the muſic, is extremely rare; and I venture to affirm, that there is no example of it unleſs where the emotion raiſed by the former is pleaſant as well as that raiſed by the latter.</p>
               <p>The ſubject we have run through, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not a little entertaining. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely curious to obſerve, in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a plurality of cauſes producing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction a great pleaſure: in other inſtances, not leſs frequent, no conjunction, but each cauſe acting in oppoſition. To enter blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a ſubject of ſuch intricacy, might gravel an acute philoſopher; and yet by taking matters in a train, the intricacy vaniſheth.</p>
               <p>Next in order, according to the method propoſed, come external effects. And this leads to paſſions in particular, which invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0258100201:182"/>
deſire are the cauſes of action. Two coexiſtent paſſions that have the ſame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, muſt be ſimilar. They accordingly readily unite, and in conjunction have dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force; which muſt hold whether the two paſſions have the ſame or different cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This is verified by experience; from which we learn, that different paſſions ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame end in view, impel the mind to action with united force. The mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not impulſes alternately from theſe paſſions, but one ſtrong impulſe from the whole in conjunction. And indeed it is not eaſy to conceive what ſhould bar the union of paſſions that have all of them the ſame tendency.</p>
               <p>Two paſſions having oppoſite tendencies, may proceed from the ſame object or cauſe conſidered in different lights. Thus a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs may at once be the object both of love and reſentment. Her beauty inflames the paſſion of love: her cruelty or inconſtancy cauſes reſentment. When two ſuch paſſions coexiſt in the ſame breaſt, the oppoſition of their aim prevents any ſort of union. They are not felt otherwiſe than in ſucceſſion.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0258100201:183"/>
And the conſequence muſt be one of two things: the paſſions will balance each other, and prevent external action; or one of them will prevail, and accompliſh its end. Guari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, in his <hi>Paſtor Fido,</hi> deſcribes beautifully the ſtruggle betwixt love and reſentment directed upon the ſame object.

Ovid paints in lively colours the vibration of mind betwixt two oppoſite paſſions directed upon the ſame object. Althea had two brothers much beloved, who were unjuſtly put to death by her ſon Meleager in a fit of paſſion. She was ſtrongly impelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; but the criminal was her own ſon. This ought to have with-held her hand. But the ſtory makes a better figure and is more intereſting, by the violence of the ſtruggle betwixt reſentment and maternal love.

               <p>Love and jealouſy connected by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon object, occupy the mind alternately. When the object is conſidered as beautiful,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0258100201:189"/>
love prevails: when conſidered as poſſibly unfaithful, jealouſy prevails. A ſituation of this kind, affords great ſcope for fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of paſſion, which is painted to the life by ſeveral maſterly hands in words as well as in colours. Shakeſpear handles the ſame ſubject, but in a manner uncommon and peculiar to himſelf. In Othello's ſoliloquy before putting his wife to death, love and jealouſy are repreſented, each exerting its whole force, but without any ſtruggle. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thello was naturally inflexible; and the tendereſt love could not divert him from a purpoſe he approved as right, not even for a moment. But every thing conſiſtent with ſuch a character is done to reconcile the two oppoſite paſſions. He is reſolved to put her to death, but he will not ſhed her blood, nor ſo much as ruffle her ſkin.

In Otway's <hi>Orphan,</hi> we have an illuſtrious example of the addreſs employed to gratify oppoſite paſſions directed upon the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Caſtalio and Polydore, brothers and rivals, had ſworn mutual confidence. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalio broke his faith by a private marriage. By this concealment, Polydore was unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily betrayed into a diſmal deed, that of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0258100201:191"/>
polluting his brother's bed. Thus he had injured his brother, and was injured by him. Juſtice prompted him to make full atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his own death: reſentment againſt his brother required a full atonement to be made to himſelf. In coexiſtent paſſions ſo contradictory, one of them commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails after a ſtruggle. But here happily an expedient occurred to gratify both; which was, that Polydore ſhould provoke his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put him to death. Polydore's crime in his own opinion merited this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and juſtice was ſatisfied when he fell by the hands of the man he had injured. He wanted at the ſame time to puniſh his brother for breach of faith; and he could not do this more effectually than by betraying his brother to be his executioner.</p>
               <p>If difference of aim prevent the union of two paſſions though having the ſame object, much more will it prevent their union when their objects are alſo different. In both caſes there is a fluctuation; but in the latter the fluctuation is ſlower than in the former. A beautiful ſituation of this kind is exhibited in the <hi>Cid</hi> of Corneille.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0258100201:192"/>
Don Diegue, an old ſoldier worn out with age, having received a mortal affront from the Count father to Chimene, employs his ſon Don Rodrigue, Chimene's lover, to demand ſatisfaction. This ſituation occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the breaſt of Don Rodrigue a cruel ſtruggle. It is a conteſt betwixt love and honour, one of which muſt be ſacrificed. The ſcene is finely conducted, chiefly by making love in ſome degree take part with honour, Don Rodrigue reflecting, that if he loſt his honour he could not deſerve his miſtreſs. Honour triumphs. The Count, provoked to a ſingle combat, falls by the hand of Don Rodrigue.</p>
               <p>This produceth another beautiful ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting Chimene, which for the ſake of connection is placed here, though it properly belongs to the foregoing head. It became the duty of that lady to demand ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt her lover, for whoſe preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in other circumſtances, ſhe chearfully would have ſacrificed her own life. The ſtruggle betwixt theſe oppoſite paſſions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected upon the ſame object, is finely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the third ſcene of the third act.<q>

               <head>PART V. The power of paſſion to adjuſt our opinions and belief to its gratification.</head>
               <p>THere is ſuch a connection among the perceptions paſſions and actions of the ſame perſon, that it would be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful if they ſhould have no mutual influence. That our actions are too much directed by paſſion, is a ſad truth. It is not leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though not ſo commonly obſerved, that paſſion hath an irregular influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our opinions and belief. The opinions we form of men and things, are generally directed by affection. An advice given by a man of figure, hath great weight; the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0258100201:195"/>
ſame advice from one in a low condition, is utterly neglected. A man of courage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-rates danger; and to the indolent, the ſlighteſt obſtacle appears unſurmountable. Our opinions indeed, the reſult commonly of various and often oppoſite views, are ſo ſlight and wavering, as readily to be ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of a bias from paſſion and prejudice.</p>
               <p>This ſubject is of great uſe in logic; and of ſtill greater uſe in criticiſm, being inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with many principles of the fine arts that will be unfolded in the courſe of this work. Being too extenſive to be treated here at large, ſome curſory illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations muſt ſuffice; leaving the ſubject to be proſecuted more particularly afterward when occaſion ſhall offer.</p>
               <p>Two principles that make an eminent figure in human nature, concur to give paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion an undue influence upon our opinions and belief. The firſt and moſt extenſive, is a ſtrong tendency in the mind to fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the gratification of its paſſions. We are prone to ſuch opinions of men and things as correſpond to our wiſhes. Where the object, in dignity or importance, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0258100201:196"/>
to the paſſion beſtowed on it, the gratification is complete and there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for artifice. But where the object is too mean for the paſſion ſo as not to afford a complete gratification, it is wonderful how apt the mind is to impoſe upon itſelf, and how diſpoſed to proportion the object to its paſſion. The other principle is a ſtrong tendency in our nature to juſtify our paſſions as well as our actions, not to others only, but even to ourſelves. This tendency is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely remarkable with reſpect to diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſions. By its influence, objects are magnified or leſſened, circumſtances ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſuppreſſed, every thing coloured and diſguiſed, to anſwer the end of juſtification. Hence the foundation of ſelf-deceit, where a man impoſes upon himſelf innocently, and even without ſuſpicion of a bias.</p>
               <p>Beſide the influence of the foregoing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to make us form opinions contrary to truth, the paſſions themſelves, by ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate means, contribute to the ſame effect. Of theſe means I ſhall mention two which ſeem to be capital. Firſt, There was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0258100201:197"/>
formerly to obſerve<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 1.</note>, that though ideas ſeldom ſtart up in the mind without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, yet that ideas which correſpond to the preſent tone of the mind are readily ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by any ſlight connection. By this means, the arguments for a favourite opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are always at hand, while we often ſearch in vain for thoſe that croſs our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Second, The mind taking delight in agreeable circumſtances or arguments, is ſtrongly impreſſed with them; while thoſe that are diſagreeable are hurried over ſo as ſcarce to make any impreſſion. The ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame argument, accordingly as it is reliſhed or not reliſhed, weighs ſo differently, as in truth to make conviction depend more on paſſion than on reaſoning. This obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is fully juſtified by experience. To confine myſelf to a ſingle inſtance, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs abſurd religious tenets that at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times have peſtered the world, would be altogether unaccountable but for this ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular bias of paſſion.</p>
               <p>We proceed to a more pleaſant taſk,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0258100201:198"/>
which is, to illuſtrate the foregoing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations by proper examples. Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude when warm, is often exerted upon the children of the benefactor; eſpecially where he is removed out of reach by death or abſence<note n="*" place="bottom">See part 1. ſect. 1. of the preſent chapter.</note>. Gratitude in this caſe being exerted for the ſake of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, requires no peculiar excellence in his children. To find however theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren worthy of the benefits intended them, contributes undoubtedly to the more entire gratification of the paſſion. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the mind, prone to gratify its paſſions, is apt to conceive a better opinion of theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than poſſibly they deſerve. By this means, ſtrong connections of affection are often formed among individuals, upon the ſlight foundation now mentioned.</p>
               <p>Envy is a paſſion, which, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unjuſtifiable, is always diſguiſed under ſome more plauſible name. But no paſſion is more eager than envy, to give its object ſuch an appearance as to anſwer a complete gratification. It magnifies every bad quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0258100201:199"/>
and fixes on the moſt humbling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>

               <p>The foregoing examples depend on the firſt principle. In the following, both prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples concur. Reſentment at firſt is wreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the relations of the offender, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0258100201:202"/>
to puniſh him. But as reſentment when ſo outrageous is contrary to conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the mind, to juſtify its paſſion as well as to gratify it, is diſpoſed to paint theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in the blackeſt colours; and it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually comes to be convinced, that they ought to be puniſhed for their own deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>Anger raiſed by an accidental ſtroke upon a tender part, which gives great and ſudden pain, is ſometimes vented upon the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning cauſe. But as the paſſion in this caſe is abſurd, and as there can be no ſolid gratification in puniſhing the innocent; the mind, prone to juſtify as well as to gratify its paſſion, deludes itſelf inſtantly into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the action's being voluntary. This conviction however is but momentary: the firſt reflection ſhows it to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; and the paſſion vaniſheth almoſt inſtantaneouſly with the conviction. But anger, the moſt violent of all paſſions, has ſtill greater influence. It ſometimes forces the mind to perſonify a ſtock or a ſtone when it occaſions bodily pain, in order to be a proper object of reſentment. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0258100201:203"/>
is formed of it as a voluntary agent. And that we have really a momentary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of its being a voluntary agent, muſt be evident from conſidering, that without ſuch conviction, the paſſion can neither be juſtified nor gratified. The imagination can give no aid. A ſtock or a ſtone may be imagined ſenſible; but a notion of this kind cannot be the foundation of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo long as the mind is conſcious that it is an imagination merely without any reality. Of ſuch perſonification, involving a conviction of reality, there is one illuſtrious inſtance. When the firſt bridge of boats over the Helleſpont was deſtroyed by a ſtorm, Xerxes fell into a tranſport of rage, ſo exceſſive, that he commanded the ſea to be puniſhed with 300 ſtripes; and a pair of fetters to be thrown into it, enjoining the following words to be pronounced. <q rend="inline">"O thou ſalt and bitter water! thy maſter hath condemned thee to this puniſhment for offending him without cauſe; and is reſolved to paſs over thee in deſpite of thy inſolence.

For the ſame reaſon, bad news gain alſo credit upon the ſlighteſt evidence. Fear, if once alarmed, has the ſame effect with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0258100201:208"/>
hope to magnify every circumſtance that tends to conviction. Shakeſpear, who ſhows more knowledge of human nature than any of our philoſophers, hath in his <hi>Cymbeline</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Act 2. ſc. 6.</note> repreſented this bias of the mind: for he makes the perſon who alone was affected with the bad news, yield to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that did not convince any of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. And Othello<note n="†" place="bottom">Act 3. ſc. 8.</note> is convinced of his wife's infidelity from circumſtances too ſlight to move an indifferent perſon.</p>
               <p>If the news intereſt us in ſo low a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to give place to reaſon, the effect will not be quite the ſame. Judging of the probability or improbability of the ſtory, the mind ſettles in a rational conviction ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it is true or not. But even in this caſe, it is obſervable, that the mind is not allowed to reſt in that degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction which is produced by rational evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. If the news be in any degree fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, our belief is augmented by hope beyond its true pitch; and if unfavourable, by fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0258100201:209"/>
The obſervation holds equally with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to future events. If a future event be either much wiſhed or dreaded, the mind, to gratify its paſſion, never fails to augment the probability beyond truth.</p>
               <p>The credit which in all ages has been given to wonders and prodigies, even the moſt abſurd and ridiculous, is a ſtrange phenomenon. Nothing can be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than the following propoſition, That the more ſingular any event is, the more evidence is required. A familiar event daily occurring, being in itſelf extremely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, finds ready credit, and therefore is vouched by the ſlighteſt evidence. But a ſtrange and rare event, contrary to the courſe of nature, ought not to be eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. It ſtarts up without connection, and without cauſe, ſo far as we can diſcover; and to overcome the improbability of ſuch an event, the very ſtrongeſt evidence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. It is certain, however, that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and prodigies are ſwallowed by the vulgar, upon evidence that would not be ſufficient to aſcertain the moſt familiar oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. It has been reckoned difficult to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0258100201:210"/>
explain this irregular bias of the mind. We are now no longer at a loſs about its cauſe. The proneneſs we have to gratify our paſſions, which diſplays itſelf upon ſo many occaſions, produces this irrational be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. A ſtory of ghoſts or fairies, told with an air of gravity and truth, raiſeth an emotion of wonder, and perhaps of dread. Theſe emotions tending ſtrongly to their own gratification, impoſe upon a weak mind, and impreſs upon it a thorough conviction contrary to all ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Opinion and belief are influenced by propenſity as well as by paſſion; for the mind is diſpoſed to gratify both. A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural propenſity is all we have to convince us, that the operations of nature are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Influenced by this propenſity, we often raſhly conceive, that good or bad weather will never have an end; and in natural philoſophy, writers, influenced by the ſame propenſity, ſtretch commonly their analogical reaſonings beyond juſt bounds.</p>
               <p>Opinion and belief are influenced by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as well as by propenſity. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>I Introduce here the ſubject propoſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it affords ſeveral curious examples of the power of paſſion to adjuſt objects to its gratification; a leſſon that cannot be too much inculcated, as there is not perhaps another bias in human nature that hath an influence ſo univerſal, and that is ſo apt to make us wander from truth as well as from juſtice.</p>
                  <p>I begin with time; and the queſtion ſhortly is, What was the meaſure of time before artificial meaſures were invented?
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0258100201:212"/>
and, What is the meaſure at preſent when theſe are not at hand? I ſpeak not of months and days, which we compute by the moon and ſun; but of hours, or in general of the time that runs betwixt any two occurrences when there is not acceſs to the ſun. The only natural meaſure we have, is the train of our thoughts; and we always judge the time to be long or ſhort, in proportion to the number of perceptions that have paſſed through the mind during that interval. This is indeed a very imperfect meaſure; becauſe in the different conditions of a quick or ſlow ſucceſſion, the computation is different. But however imperfect, it is the only meaſure by which a perſon natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally calculates time; and this meaſure is applied on all occaſions, without regard to any occaſional variation in the rate of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
                  <p>This natural meaſure of time, imperfect as it is, would however be tolerable, did it labour under no other imperfection than the ordinary variations that happen in the motion of our perceptions. But in many particular circumſtances, it is much more fallacious;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0258100201:213"/>
and in order to explain theſe diſtinctly, I muſt analize the ſubject. Time is generally computed at two different periods; one while time is paſſing, another after it is paſt. I ſhall conſider theſe ſeparately, with the errors to which each of them is liable. It will be found that theſe errors often produce very different computations of the ſame period of time. The computation of time while it is paſſing, comes firſt in order. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and trite obſervation, That to lovers ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence appears immeaſurably long, every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute an hour, and every hour a day. The ſame computation is made in every caſe where we long for a diſtant event; as where one is in expectation of good news, or where a profligate heir watches for the death of an old man who keeps him from a great eſtate. Oppoſite to theſe are inſtances not fewer in number. To a criminal the interval betwixt ſentence and execution appears miſerably ſhort; and the ſame holds in every caſe where one dreads an approaching event. Of this even a ſchoolboy can bear witneſs: the hour allowed him for play, moves, in his apprehenſion, with a very ſwift pace: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0258100201:214"/>
he is thoroughly engaged, the hour is gone. A reckoning founded on the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ideas, will never produce computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo regularly oppoſite to each other; for a ſlow ſucceſſion of ideas is not connected with our wiſhes, nor a quick ſucceſſion with our fears. What is it then, that, in the caſes mentioned, moves nature to deſert her common meaſure for one very different? I know not that this queſtion ever has been reſolved. The falſe reckonings I have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted are ſo common and familiar, that no writer has thought of inquiring for their cauſe. And indeed, to enter upon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at ſhort hand, without preparation, might occaſion ſome difficulty. But to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the difficulty, we luckily are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by what is ſaid above about the power of paſſion to fit objects for its gratification. Among the other circumſtances that terrify a condemned criminal, the ſhort time he has to live is one. Terror, like our other paſſions, prone to its gratification, adjuſts every one of theſe circumſtances to its own tone. It magnifies in particular the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the interval betwixt the preſent time
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0258100201:215"/>
and that of the execution; and forces upon the criminal a conviction that the hour of his death approaches with a ſwift pace. In the ſame manner, among the other diſtreſſes of an abſent lover, the time of ſeparation is a capital circumſtance, which for that reaſon is greatly magnified by his anxiety and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. He imagines that the time of meeting comes on very ſlow, or rather that it will never come. Every minute is thought of an intolerable length. Here is a fair and I hope ſatisfactory account, why we reckon time to be tedious when we long for a future event, and not leſs fleet when we dread the event. This account is confirmed by other inſtances. Bodily pain fixt to one part, produceth a ſlow train of perceptions, which, according to the common meaſure of time, ought to make it appear ſhort. Yet we know, that in ſuch a ſtate time has the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite appearance. Bodily pain is always attended with a degree of impatience and an anxiety to be rid of it, which make us judge every minute to be an hour. The ſame holds where the pain ſhifts from place to place; but not ſo remarkably, becauſe ſuch
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0258100201:216"/>
a pain is not attended with the ſame degree of impatience. The impatience a man hath in travelling through a barren country or in bad roads, makes him imagine, during the journey, that time goes on with a very ſlow pace. We ſhall ſhow afterward that he makes a very different computation when his journey is at an end.</p>
                  <p>How ought it to ſtand with a man who apprehends bad news? It will probably be thought, that the caſe of this man reſembles that of a criminal, who, in reckoning the ſhort time he has to live, imagines every hour to be but a minute, and that time flies ſwift away. Yet the computation here is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite. Reflecting upon this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, there appears one capital circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which the two caſes differ. The fate of the criminal is determined: in the caſe under conſideration, the man is ſtill in ſuſpenſe. Every one knows how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſsful ſuſpenſe is to the bulk of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Such diſtreſs we wiſh to get rid of at any rate, even at the expence of bad news. This caſe therefore, upon a more narrow inſpection, reſembles that of bodily pain.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0258100201:217"/>
The preſent diſtreſs in both caſes, makes the time appear extremely tedious.</p>
                  <p>The reader probably will not be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to have this branch of the ſubject illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in a pleaſant manner, by an author acquainted with every maze of the human heart, and who beſtows ineffable grace and ornament upon every ſubject he handles.</p>

                  <p>Reflecting upon the natural method of computing preſent time, it ſhows how far from truth we may be led by the irregular power of paſſion. Nor are our eyes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately opened when the ſcene is paſt: the deception continues while there remain any traces of the paſſion. But looking back upon paſt time when the joy or diſtreſs is no
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0258100201:219"/>
longer remembered, the computation we make is very different. In this ſituation, paſſion being out of the queſtion, we apply the ordinary meaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> the courſe of our perceptions; and I ſhall now proceed to the errors that this meaſure is ſubjected to. In order to have an accurate notion of this matter, we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt a train of perceptions, and a train of ideas. Real objects make a ſtrong impreſſion, and are faithfully remembered. Ideas, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, however entertaining at the time, are apt to eſcape an after recollection. Hence it is, that in retroſpection, the time that was employed upon real objects, appears longer than the time that was employed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ideas. The former are more accurately recollected than the latter; and we meaſure the time by the number that is recollected. I proceed to particulars. After finiſhing a journey through a populous country, the frequency of agreeable objects diſtinctly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected by the traveller, makes the time ſpent in the journey appear to him longer than it was in reality. This is chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in a firſt journey, where every
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0258100201:220"/>
object is new and makes a ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. On the other hand, after finiſhing a journey through a barren country thinly peopled, the time appears ſhort, being mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the number of objects, which were few and far from intereſting. Here in both inſtances a reckoning is brought out, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to that made during the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And this, by the way, ſerves to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for a thing which may appear ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that in a barren country the computed miles are always longer, than near the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, where the country is rich and populous. The traveller has no natural meaſure of the ſpace gone through, other than the time beſtowed upon it; nor any natural meaſure of the time, other than the number of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. Theſe being proportioned to the number of viſible objects, he imagines that he hath conſumed more time on his day's journey, and accompliſhed a greater number of miles, in a populous than in a waſte country. By this method of calculation, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very computed mile in the former muſt in reality be ſhorter than in the latter.</p>
                  <p>Again, the travelling with an agreeable
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0258100201:221"/>
companion produceth a ſhort computation both of the road and of time; eſpecially if there be few objects that demand attention, or if the objects be familiar. The caſe is the ſame of young people at a ball, or of a joyous company over a bottle. The ideas with which they have been entertained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſitory, eſcape the memory. After all is over, they reflect that they have been much diverted, but ſcarce can ſay about what.</p>
                  <p>When one is totally occupied in any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable work that admits not many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, time runs on without obſervation; and upon an after recollection muſt appear ſhort, in proportion to the paucity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. This is ſtill more remarkable in cloſe contemplation and in deep thinking, where the train, compoſed wholly of ideas, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with an extreme ſlow pace. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are the ideas few in number, but are apt to eſcape an after-reckoning. The like falſe reckoning of time may proceed from an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſtate of mind. In a reverie, where ideas float at random without making any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, time goes on unheeded and the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0258100201:222"/>
reckoning is loſt. A reverie may be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found as to prevent the recollection of any one idea: that the mind was buſied in a train of thinking, will in general be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered; but what was the ſubject, has quite eſcaped the memory. In ſuch a caſe, we are altogether at a loſs about the time: we have no <hi>data</hi> for making a computation. No cauſe produceth ſo falſe a reckoning of time, as immoderate grief. The mind, in this ſtate, is violently attached to a ſingle object, and admits not a different thought. Any other object breaking in, is inſtantly baniſhed, ſo as ſcarce to give an appearance of ſucceſſion. In a reverie, we are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the time that is paſt: but in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample now given, there is an appearance of certainty, ſo far as the natural meaſure of time can be truſted, that the time muſt have been ſhort, when the perceptions are ſo few in number.</p>
                  <p>The natural meaſure of ſpace appears more obſcure than that of time. I venture however to enter upon it, leaving it to be further proſecuted, if it be thought of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny importance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0258100201:223"/>
The ſpace marked out for a houſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears conſiderably larger after it is divided into its proper parts. A piece of ground ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears larger after it is ſurrounded with a fence; and ſtill larger when it is made a garden and divided into different copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, a large plain looks leſs after it is divided into parts. The ſea muſt be excepted, which looks leſs from that very circumſtance of not being divided into parts.</p>
                  <p>A room of a moderate ſize appears larger when properly furniſhed. But when a very large room is furniſhed, I doubt whether it be not leſſened in appearance.</p>
                  <p>A room of a moderate ſize, looks leſs by having a ceiling lower than in proportion. The ſame low ceiling makes a very large room look larger than it is in reality.</p>
                  <p>Theſe experiments are by far too ſmall a ſtock for a general theory. But they are all that occur at preſent; and without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any regular ſyſtem, I ſhall ſatisfy myſelf with a few conjectures.</p>
                  <p>The largeſt angle of viſion ſeems to me
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0258100201:224"/>
the natural meaſure of ſpace. The eye is the only judge; and in examining with it the ſize of any plain, or the length of any line, the moſt accurate method that can be taken is, to run over the object in parts. The largeſt part that can be taken in at one ſtedfaſt look, determines the largeſt angle of viſion; and when that angle is given, one may inſtitute a calculation by trying with the eye how many of theſe parts are in the whole.</p>
                  <p>Whether this angle be the ſame in all men, I know not. The ſmalleſt angle of viſion is aſcertained; and to aſcertain the largeſt angle, would not be leſs curious.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing it known, it would be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect meaſure; perhaps more ſo than the natural meaſure of time. It requires great ſteadineſs of eye to meaſure a line with any accuracy, by applying to it the largeſt angle of diſtinctviſion. And ſuppoſe this ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to be acquired by practice, the meaſure will be imperfect from other circumſtances. The ſpace comprehended under this angle, will be different according to the diſtance, and alſo according to the ſituation of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0258100201:225"/>
Of a perpendicular this angle will comprehend the ſmalleſt ſpace. The ſpace will be larger in looking upon an inclined plain; and will be larger or leſs in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the degree of inclination.</p>
                  <p>This meaſure of ſpace, like the meaſure of time, is liable to ſome extraordinary errors from certain operations of the mind, which will account for ſome of the erroneous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above mentioned. The ſpace mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for a dwelling-houſe, where the eye is at any reaſonable diſtance, is ſeldom great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than can be ſeen at once without moving the head. Divide this ſpace into two or three equal parts, and none of theſe parts will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear much leſs than what can be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended at one diſtinct look; conſequently each of them will appear equal, or nearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, to what the whole did before the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. If, on the other hand, the whole be very ſmall, ſo as ſcarce to fill the eye at one look, its diviſions into parts will, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, make it appear ſtill leſs. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs of the parts is, by an eaſy tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ideas, transferred to the whole. Each part hath a diminutive appearance, and by
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0258100201:226"/>
the intimate connection of theſe parts with the whole, we paſs the ſame judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all.</p>
                  <p>The ſpace marked out for a ſmall garden, is ſurveyed almoſt at one view; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a motion of the eye ſo ſlight, as to paſs for an object that can be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the largeſt angle of diſtinct viſion. If not divided into too many parts, we are apt to form the ſame judgement of each part; and conſequently to magnify the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in proportion to the number of its parts.</p>
                  <p>A very large plain without protuberances, is an object not leſs rare than beautiful; and in thoſe who ſee it for the firſt time, it muſt produce an emotion of wonder. This emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however ſlight, tending to its own gratification, impoſes upon the mind, and makes it judge that the plain is larger than it is in reality. Divide this plain into parts, and our wonder ceaſes. It is no longer conſidered as one great plain, but as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different fields or incloſures.</p>
                  <p>The firſt time one beholds the ſea, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be large beyond all bounds. When
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0258100201:227"/>
it becomes familiar, and raiſes our wonder in no degree, it appears leſs than it is in reality. In a ſtorm it appears larger, being diſtinguiſhable by the rolling waves into a number of great parts. Iſlands ſcattered at conſiderable diſtances, add in appearance to its ſize. Each intercepted part looks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely large, and we ſilently apply arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic to increaſe the appearance of the whole. Many iſlands ſcattered at hand, give a diminutive appearance to the ſea, by its connection with its diminutive parts. The Lomond lake would undoubtedly look larger without its iſlands.</p>
                  <p>Furniture increaſeth in appearance the ſize of a ſmall room, for the ſame reaſon that diviſions increaſe in appearance the ſize of a garden. The emotion of wonder which is raiſed by a very large room with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out furniture, makes it look larger than it is in reality. If completely furniſhed, we view it in parts, and our wonder is not raiſed.</p>
                  <p>A low ceiling hath a diminutive appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which, by an eaſy tranſition of ideas, is communicated to the length and breadth, provided they bear any ſort of proportion to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0258100201:228"/>
the height. If they be out of all propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the oppoſition ſeizes the mind, and raiſes ſome degree of wonder, which makes the difference appear greater than it real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is.</p>

               <head>PART VI. Of the reſemblance emotions bear to their cauſes.</head>
               <p>THat many emotions bear a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to their cauſes, is a truth that can be made clear by induction; though, ſo far as I know, the obſervation has not been made by any writer. Motion, in its different circumſtances, is productive of feelings that reſemble it. Sluggiſh motion, for example, cauſeth a languid unpleaſant feeling; ſlow uniform motion, a feeling calm and pleaſant; and briſk motion, a lively feeling that rouſes the ſpirits and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes activity. A fall of water through rocks, raiſes in the mind a tumultuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed agitation, extremely ſimilar to its
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0258100201:229"/>
cauſe. When force is exerted with any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the ſpectator feels a ſimilar effort as of force exerted within his mind. A large object ſwells the heart. An elevated object makes the ſpectator ſtand erect.</p>
               <p>Sounds alſo produce emotions that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them. A ſound in a low key, brings down the mind. Such a ſound in a full tone, hath a certain ſolemnity, which it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates to the emotion produced by it. A ſound in a high key, chears the mind by raiſing it. Such a ſound in a full tone, both elevates and ſwells the mind.</p>
               <p>Again, a wall or pillar that declines from the perpendicular, produceth a painful emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as of a tottering and falling within the mind. An emotion ſomewhat ſimilar is produced by a tall pillar that ſtands ſo tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as to look like falling. For this reaſon, a column upon a baſe looks better than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the naked ground. The baſe, which makes a part of the column, inſpires a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of firmneſs and ſtability. The ground ſupporting a naked column, is too large to be conſidered as its baſe. And for the ſame reaſon, a cube as a baſe, is preferred before
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0258100201:230"/>
a cylinder, though the latter is a more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful figure. The angles of a cube, being extended to a greater diſtance from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre than the circumference of a cylinder, give the column a greater appearance of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. This excludes not a different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the baſe, ſhaft, and capital, of a pillar, ought, for the ſake of variety, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from each other. If the ſhaft be round, the baſe and capital ought to be ſquare.</p>
               <p>A conſtrained poſture, uneaſy to the man himſelf, is diſagreeable to the ſpectator; which makes it a rule in painting, that the drapery ought not to adhere to the body, but hang looſe, that the figures may appear eaſy and free in their movements. Hence the diſagreeable figure of a French dancing-maſter is one of Hogarth's pieces. It is alſo ridiculous, becauſe the conſtraint is aſſumed and not forced.</p>
               <p>The foregoing obſervation is not confined to emotions raiſed by ſtill life. It holds alſo in thoſe which are raiſed by the qualities, actions, and paſſions, of a ſenſible being. Love inſpired by a fine woman, aſſumes her qualities. It is ſublime, ſoft, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0258100201:231"/>
ſevere, or gay, according to its cauſe. This is ſtill more remarkable in emotions raiſed by human actions. It hath already been remarked<note n="*" place="bottom">Part 1. of this chapter, ſect. 3.</note>, that any ſignal inſtance of gratitude, beſide procuring eſteem for the author, raiſeth in the ſpectator a vague emotion of gratitude, which diſpoſeth him to be grateful. I now further remark, that this vague emotion, being of the ſame kind with what produced the grateful action, hath a ſtrong reſemblance to its cauſe. Courage exerted inſpires the reader as well as the ſpectator with a like emotion of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. A juſt action fortifies our love to juſtice, and a generous action rouſes our generoſity. In ſhort, with reſpect to all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions, it will be found by induction, that they lead us to imitation by inſpiring emotions reſembling the paſſions that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced theſe actions. And hence the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of dealing in choice books and in choice company.</p>
               <p>Grief as well as joy are infectious: the emotions they raiſe in a ſpectator reſemble
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0258100201:232"/>
them perfectly. Fear is equally infectious: and hence in an army, fear, even from the ſlighteſt cauſe, making an impreſſion on a few, ſpreads generally through all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an univerſal panic. Pity is ſimilar to its cauſe. A parting ſcene betwixt lovers or friends, produceth in the ſpectator a ſort of pity, which is tender like the diſtreſs. The anguiſh of remorſe, produceth pity of a harſh kind; and if the remorſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, the pity hath a mixture of horror. Anger I think is ſingular; for even where it is moderate and cauſeth no diſguſt, it diſpoſes not the ſpectator to anger in any degree<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtotle, poet. cap. 18. §3. ſays, that anger raiſeth in the ſpectator a ſimilar emotion of anger.</note>. Covetouſneſs, cruelty, treachery, and other vicious paſſions, are ſo far from raiſing any emotion ſimilar to themſelves, to incite a ſpectator to imitation, that they have an oppoſite effect. They raiſe abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and fortify the ſpectator in his aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſuch actions. When anger is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, it cannot fail to produce the ſame effect.</p>

               <p>IT is a law in our nature, that we never act but by the impulſe of deſire; which in other words is ſaying, that it is paſſion, by the deſire included in it, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the will. Hence in the conduct of life, it is of the utmoſt importance, that our paſſions be directed upon proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, tend to juſt and rational ends, and with relation to each other be duly balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The beauty of contrivance, ſo conſpicuous in the human frame, is not confined to the rational part of our nature, but is viſible over the whole. Concerning the paſſions in particular, however irregular, headſtrong, and perverſe, in an overly view, they may appear, I propoſe to ſhow, that they are by nature adjuſted and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with admirable wiſdom, for the good of ſociety as well as for private good.

This ſubject is extenſive: but as the nature of the preſent undertaking will not admit a complete diſcuſſion, it ſhall ſuffice to give a few obſervations in general upon the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part of our nature, without regarding that ſtrange irregularity of paſſion diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome individuals.

               <p>In order to a diſtinct apprehenſion of the preſent ſubject, it muſt be premiſed, that an agreeable object produceth always a pleaſant emotion, and a diſagreeable object one that is painful. This is a general law of nature, which admits not a ſingle excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Agreeableneſs in the object or cauſe is indeed ſo eſſentially connected with pleaſure in the emotion its effect, that an agreeable object cannot be better defined, than by its power of producing a pleaſant emotion. Diſagreeableneſs in the object or cauſe, has
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0258100201:235"/>
the ſame neceſſary connection with pain in the emotion produced by it.</p>
               <p>From this preliminary it appears, that to inquire for what end an emotion is made pleaſant or painful, reſolves into an inquiry for what end its cauſe is made agreeable or diſagreeable. And from the moſt accurate induction it will be diſcovered, that no cauſe of an emotion is made agreeable or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able arbitrarily; but that theſe qualities are ſo diſtributed as to anſwer wiſe and good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. It is an invincible proof of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of the Deity, that we are ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with things generally agreeable, which contribute remarkably to our entertainment and to our happineſs. Some things are made diſagreeable, ſuch as a rotten carcaſs, becauſe they are noxious. Others, a dirty marſh, for example, or a barren heath, are made diſagreeable in order to excite our induſtry. And with reſpect to the few things that are neither agreeable nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable; it will be made evident, that their being left indifferent is not a work of chance but of wiſdom. Of ſuch I ſhall have occaſion to give ſeveral inſtances.</p>

Having attempted to aſſign the final cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of emotions and paſſions conſidered as pleaſant or painful, we proceed to the final cauſes of the deſires involved in them. This ſeems a work of ſome difficulty; for the deſires that accompany different paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have very different aims, and ſeldom or never demand preciſely the ſame gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. One paſſion moves us to cling to its object, one to fly from it; one paſſion impels to action for our own good, and one for the good of others; one paſſion prompts us to do good to ourſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and one to do miſchief, frequently to others, and ſometimes even to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Deliberating upon this intricate ſubject, and finding an intimate corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence betwixt our deſires and their objects, it is natural to think that the former muſt be regulated in ſome meaſure by the latter. In this view, I begin with deſire directed upon an inanimate object.</p>
               <p>Any pleaſure we have in an agreeable object of this kind, is enjoyed by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the pleaſant impreſſion it makes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; and accordingly the deſire involved in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0258100201:237"/>
the pleaſant emotion tends to that end, and is gratified by dwelling upon the agreeable object. Hence ſuch an object may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed <hi>attractive.</hi> Thus a flowing river, a towering hill, a fine garden, are attractive objects. They fix the attention of the ſpectator, by inſpiring pleaſant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, which are gratified by adhering to theſe objects and enjoying them. On the other hand, a diſagreeable object of the ſame kind, raiſes in us a painful emotion including a deſire to turn from the object, which relieves us of courſe from the pain; and hence ſuch an object may be properly termed <hi>repulſive.</hi> A monſtrous birth, for example, a rotten carcaſs, a confuſion of jarring ſounds, are repulſive. They repel the mind, by inſpiring painful or unpleaſant emotions, which are gratified by flying from ſuch objects. Thus in general, with regard to inanimate objects, the deſire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in every pleaſant paſſion tends to prolong the pleaſure, and the deſire inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in every painful paſſion tends to put an end to the pain. Here the final cauſe is evident. Our deſires, ſo far, are modelled
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0258100201:238"/>
in ſuch a manner as to correſpond preciſely to the ſenſitive part of our nature, prone to happineſs and averſe to miſery. Theſe operations of adhering to an agreeable ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate object, and flying from one that is diſagreeable, are performed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of life by means of deſire impelling us, without the intervention of reaſon or reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Reaſon and reflection directing ſelf-love, become afterward motives that unite their force with deſire; becauſe experience informs us, that the adhering to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objects and the flying from thoſe that are diſagreeable, contribute to our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Senſible Beings conſidered as objects of paſſion, lead us into a more complex theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. A ſenſible being that is agreeable by its attributes, inſpires us with a pleaſant emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the deſire included in this emotion has evidently different means of gratification. A man regarding himſelf only, may be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with viewing and contemplating this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preciſely as if it were inanimate; or he may deſire the more generous gratification of making it happy. Were man altogether
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0258100201:239"/>
ſelfiſh, it would be conformable to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he ſhould indulge the pleaſant emotion without making any acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the perſon who gives him pleaſure, more than to a pure air or temperate clime when he enjoys theſe benefits. But as man is endued with a principle of benevolence as well as of ſelfiſhneſs, he is prompted by his nature to deſire the good of every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible being that gives him pleaſure. And the final cauſe of deſire ſo directed, is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious. It contributes to a man's own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by affording him more means of gratification than he can have when his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire terminates upon himſelf alone; and at the ſame time it tends eminently to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the happineſs of thoſe with whom he is connected. The directing our deſires in this manner, occaſions a beautiful coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of ſelf-love with benevolence; for both are equally promoted by the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal impulſe, and by the ſame external conduct. And this conſideration, by the way, ought to ſilence thoſe minute philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, who, ignorant of human nature, teach a moſt diſguſtful doctrine, That to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0258100201:240"/>
ſerve others unleſs with a view to our own good, is weakneſs and folly; as if ſelf-love only contributed to happineſs and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. The hand of God is too viſible in the human frame, to permit us to think ſeriouſly, that there ever can be any jarring or inconſiſtency among natural principles, thoſe eſpecially of ſelf-love and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which regulate the bulk of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Next in order come ſenſible Beings that are in affliction or pain. It is diſagreeable to behold a perſon in diſtreſs; and therefore this object muſt raiſe in the ſpectator an uneaſy emotion. Were man purely a ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh being, he would be prompted by his nature to turn from every object, animate or inanimate, that gives him uneaſineſs. But the principle of benevolence gives an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite direction to his deſire. It impels him to afford relief; and by relieving the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from diſtreſs, his deſire is fully grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Our benevolence to a perſon in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs is inflamed into an emotion of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſignifying in Greek the painful emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is raiſed in us by that perſon.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0258100201:241"/>
Thus ſympathy, though a painful emotion, is in its nature attractive. And with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to its final cauſe, we can be at no loſs. It not only tends to relieve a fellow-creature from pain, but in its gratification is greatly more pleaſant than if it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive.</p>
               <p>We in the laſt place bring under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration perſons hateful by vice or wickedneſs. Imagine a wretch who has lately perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome horrid crime. he is diſagreeable to every ſpectator; and conſequently raiſes in every ſpectator a painful emotion. What is the natural gratification of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that accompanies this painful emotion? I muſt here again obſerve, that ſuppoſing man to be entirely a ſelfiſh being, he would be prompted by his nature to relieve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the pain by averting his eye, and baniſhing the criminal from his thoughts. But man is not ſo conſtituted. He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of many principles, which, though ſeemingly contradictory, are perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant. The principle of benevolence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences his conduct, not leſs remarkably than that of ſelfiſhneſs. And in order to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0258100201:242"/>
anſwer the foregoing queſtion, I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a third principle, not leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in its influence than either of thoſe mentioned. It is that principle common to all, which prompts us to puniſh thoſe who do wrong. An envious, malicious, or cruel action, is diſagreeable to me even where I have no connection with the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, and raiſes in me the painful emotion of reſentment. The gratification of this emotion, when accompanied with deſire, is directed by the principle now unfolded. Being prompted by my nature to puniſh guilt as well as to reward virtue, my deſire is not gratified but by inflicting puniſhment. I muſt chaſtiſe the wretch by indignation at leaſt and hatred, if not more ſeverely. Here the final cauſe is ſelf-evident.</p>
               <p>An injury done to myſelf, touching me more than when done to others, raiſes my reſentment in a higher degree. The deſire accordingly included in this paſſion, is not ſatisfied with ſo ſlight a puniſhment as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation or hatred. It is not fully gratified without retaliation; and the author muſt by my hand ſuffer miſchief, as great at leaſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0258100201:243"/>
as he has done me. Neither can we be at any loſs about the final cauſe of this higher degree of reſentment. The whole vigor of this paſſion is required to ſecure individuals from the injuſtice and oppreſſion of others<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>A wicked or diſgraceful action, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable not only to others, but even to the delinquent himſelf. It raiſes in him as well as in others a painful emotion including a deſire of puniſhment. The painful emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the delinquent feels, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of <hi>remorſe</hi>; and in this caſe the deſire he has to puniſh is directed againſt himſelf. There cannot be imagined a better contrivance to deter us from vice; for remorſe is the ſevereſt of all puniſhments. This paſſion and the deſire of ſelf-puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment derived from it, are touched delicately by Terence.

               <p>The caſes mentioned are, where benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence alone or where deſire of puniſhment alone, governs without a rival. And it was neceſſary to handle theſe caſes ſeparately, in order to elucidate a ſubject which by writers is left in great obſcurity. But neither of theſe principles operates always without rivalſhip. Caſes may be figured, and caſes actually exiſt, where the ſame perſon is an object both of ſympathy and of deſire to puniſh. Thus the ſight of a profligate in the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real diſeaſe, over-run with botches and fores, actuates both principles. While his diſtreſs fixes my attention, ſympathy exerts
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0258100201:246"/>
itſelf; but ſo ſoon as I think of his profliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, hatred prevails, and a deſire to puniſh. This in general is the caſe of diſtreſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by immoral actions that are not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly criminal. And if the diſtreſs and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral action be in any proportion, ſympathy and hatred counterbalancing each other will not ſuffer me either to afford relief or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puniſhment. What then will be the reſult of the whole? The principle of ſelf-love ſolves the queſtion. Abhorring an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo loathſome, I naturally avert my eye, and walk off as faſt as I can, in order to be relieved from the pain.</p>
               <p>The preſent ſubject gives birth to ſeveral other obſervations, for which I could not find room above, without relaxing more from the ſtrictneſs of order and connection, than with ſafety could be indulged in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing upon a matter that with difficulty is made perſpicuous, even with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of order and connection. Theſe obſervations I ſhall throw out looſely as they occur, without giving myſelf any further trouble about method.</p>
               <p>No action good or bad is altogether indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0258100201:247"/>
even to a mere ſpectator. If good, it inſpires eſteem; and indignation, if wicked. But it is remarkable, that theſe emotions ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are accompanied with deſire. The abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of man are limited, and he finds ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient employment, in relieving the diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in requiting his benefactors, and in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thoſe who wrong him, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of his own ſphere for the benefit or chaſtiſement of thoſe with whom he has no connection.</p>
               <p>If the good qualities of others excite my benevolence, the ſame qualities in myſelf muſt produce a ſimilar effect in a ſuperior degree, upon account of the natural partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity every man hath for himſelf. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes ſelf-love. If theſe qualities be of a high rank, they produce a feeling of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, which naturally leads me to aſſume ſome ſort of government over others. Mean qualities, on the other hand, produce in me a feeling of inferiority, which naturally leads me to ſubmit to others. Unleſs ſuch feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were diſtributed among individuals in ſociety by meaſure and proportion, there could be no natural ſubordination of ſome
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0258100201:248"/>
to others, which is the principal foundation of government.</p>
               <p>No other branch of the human conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhows more viſibly our deſtination for ſociety, nor tends more to our improvement, than appetite for fame or eſteem. The whole conveniencies of life being derived from mutual aid and ſupport in ſociety, it ought to be a capital aim, to form connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with others ſo ſtrict and ſo extenſive as to produce a firm reliance on many for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in time of need. Reaſon dictates this leſſon. But reaſon ſolely is not relied on in a matter of ſuch conſequence. We are moved by a natural appetite, to be ſolicitous about eſteem and reſpect as we are about food when hungry. This appetite, at the ſame time, is finely adjuſted to the moral branch of our conſtitution, by promoting all the moral virtues. For what infallible means are there to attract love and eſteem, other than a virtuous courſe of life? If a man be juſt and beneficent, if he be temperate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and prudent, he will infallibly gain the eſteem and love of all who know him.</p>
               <p>The communication of paſſion to related
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0258100201:249"/>
objects, is an illuſtrious inſtance of the care of Providence, to extend ſocial connections as far as the limited nature of man can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. This communication of paſſion is ſo far unhappy as to ſpread the malevolent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions beyond their natural bounds. But let it be remarked, that this unhappy effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards ſavages only, who give way to male-volent paſſions. Under the diſcipline of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, theſe paſſions are ſubdued, and in a good meaſure eradicated. In their place ſucceed the kindly affections, which, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all encouragement, take poſſeſſion of the mind and govern our whole actions. In this condition, the progreſs of paſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long related objects, by ſpreading the kindly affections through a multitude of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, hath a glorious effect.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more entertaining to a rational mind, than the oeconomy of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man paſſions, of which I have attempted to give ſome faint notion. It muſt however be confeſſed, that our paſſions, when they happen to ſwell beyond their proper limits, take on a leſs regular appearance. Reaſon may proclaim our duty, but the will influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0258100201:250"/>
by paſſion, makes gratification always welcome. Hence the power of paſſion, which, when in exceſs, cannot be reſiſted but by the utmoſt fortitude of mind. It is bent upon gratification; and where proper objects are wanting, it clings to any object at hand without diſtinction. Thus joy inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a fortunate event, is diffuſed upon every perſon around by acts of benevolence; and reſentment for an atrocious injury done by one out of reach, ſeizes the firſt object that occurs to vent itſelf upon. Thoſe who believe in prophecies, even wiſh the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; and a weak mind is diſpoſed vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to fulfil a prophecy, in order to gratify its wiſh.

            <head>CHAP. III. BEAUTY.</head>
            <p>HAVING diſcourſed in general of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and paſſions, I proceed to a more narrow inſpection of ſome particulars that ſerve to unfold the principles of the fine arts. It is the province of a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon ethics, to give a full enumeration of all the paſſions; and of each ſeparately to aſſign the nature, the cauſe, the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the effects. But a treatiſe of ethics is not my province. I carry my view no farther than to the elements of criticiſm, in order to ſhow that the fine arts are a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of reaſoning as well as of taſte. An extenſive work would be ill ſuited to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſo limited; and to keep within mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bounds, the following plan may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute. It has already been obſerved, that things are the cauſes of emotions, by means of their properties and attributes<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 2. part. 1. ſect. 1. firſt note.</note>. This
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0258100201:253"/>
furniſheth a hint for diſtribution. Inſtead of a painful and tedious examination of the ſeveral paſſions and emotions, I propoſe to confine my inquiries to ſuch attributes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and circumſtances, as in the fine arts are chiefly employed to raiſe agreeable emotions. Attributes of ſingle objects, as the moſt ſimple, ſhall take the lead; to be followed with particulars that depend on the relations of objects, and are not found in any one object ſingly conſidered. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching next ſome coincident matters, I approach nearer to practice, by applying the principles unfolded in the foregoing parts of the work. This is a general view of the intended method; reſerving however a privilege to vary it in particular inſtances, where a different method may be more commodious. I begin with beauty, the moſt noted of all the qualities that belong to ſingle objects.</p>
            <p>The term <hi>beauty,</hi> in its native ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is appropriated to objects of ſight. Objects of the other ſenſes may be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſuch as the ſounds of muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſmoothneſs and ſoftneſs of ſome
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0258100201:254"/>
ſurfaces: but the agreeableneſs denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>beauty</hi> belongs to objects of ſight.</p>
            <p>Of all the objects of the external ſenſes, an object of ſight is the moſt complex. In the very ſimpleſt, colour is perceived, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and length breadth and thickneſs. A tree is compoſed of a trunk, branches, and leaves. It has colour, figure, ſize, and ſometimes motion. By means of each of theſe particulars, ſeparately conſidered, it appears beautiful: how much more ſo, when they enter all into one complex per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception? The beauty of the human figure is extraordinary, being a compoſition of numberleſs beauties ariſing from the parts and qualities of the object, various colours, various motions, figure, ſize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>; all u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting in one complex perception, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the eye with combined force. Hence it is, that beauty, a quality ſo remarkable in viſible objects, lends its name to expreſs every thing that is eminently agreeable. Thus, by a figure of ſpeech, we ſay a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſound, a beautiful thought or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a beautiful theorem, a beautiful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, a beautiful diſcovery in art or ſcience.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0258100201:255"/>
But as figurative expreſſion is not our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent theme, this chapter is confined to beauty in its genuine ſignification.</p>
            <p>It is natural to ſuppoſe, that a perception ſo various as that of beauty, comprehending ſometimes many particulars, ſometimes few, ſhould occaſion emotions equally various. And yet all the various emotions of beauty maintain one general character of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gaiety.</p>
            <p>Conſidering attentively the beauty of viſible objects, we diſcover two kinds. One may be termed <hi>intrinſic</hi> beauty, becauſe it is diſcovered in a ſingle object viewed apart without relation to any other object. The examples above given, are of that kind. The other may be termed <hi>relative</hi> beauty, being founded on the relation of objects. The former is a perception of ſenſe merely; for to perceive the beauty of a ſpreading oak or of a flowing river, no more is required but ſingly an act of viſion. The latter is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an act of underſtanding and reflection; for of a fine inſtrument or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, we perceive not the relative beauty, until we be made acquainted with its uſe and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0258100201:256"/>
deſtination. In a word, intrinſic beauty is ultimate: relative beauty is that of means relating to ſome good end or purpoſe. Theſe different beauties agree in one capital cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that both are equally perceived as ſpread upon the object. This will be readily admitted with reſpect to intrinſic beauty; but is not ſo obvious with reſpect to the other. The utility of the plough, for example, may make it an object of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or of deſire; but why ſhould utility make it appear beautiful? A principle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 2. part 1. ſect. 4.</note>, will explain this doubt. The beauty of the effect, by an eaſy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of ideas, is transferred to the cauſe, and is perceived as one of the qualities of the cauſe. Thus a ſubject void of intrinſic beauty, appears beautiful from its utility. An old Gothic tower that has no beauty in itſelf, appears beautiful, conſidered as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to defend againſt an enemy. A dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſe void of all regularity, is however beautiful in the view of convenience; and the want of form or ſymmetry in a tree,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0258100201:257"/>
will not prevent its appearing beautiful, if it be known to produce good fruit.</p>
            <p>When theſe two beauties concur in any object, it appears delightful. Every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the human body poſſeſſes both in a high degree. The ſlender make of a horſe deſtined for running, pleaſes every taſte; partly from ſymmetry, and partly from utility.</p>
            <p>The beauty of utility, being proportioned accurately to the degree of utility, requires no illuſtration. But intrinſic beauty, ſo complex as I have ſaid, cannot be handled diſtinctly without being analized into its conſtituent parts. If a tree be beautiful by means of its colour, its figure, its ſize, its motion, it is in reality poſſeſſed of ſo many different beauties, which ought to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined ſeparately, in order to have a clear notion of the whole. The beauty of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is too familiar to need explanation. The beauty of figure requires an accurate diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for in it many circumſtances are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved. When any portion of matter is viewed as a whole, the beauty of its figure ariſes from regularity and ſimplicity. View<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0258100201:258"/>
the parts with relation to each other, uniformity, proportion, and order, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to its beauty. The beauty of motion deſerves a chapter by itſelf; and another chapter is deſtined for grandeur, being diſtinguiſhable from beauty in a ſtrict ſenſe. For the definitions of regularity, uniformity, proportion, and order, if thought neceſſary, I remit my reader to the appendix at the end of the book. Upon ſimplicity I muſt make a few curſory obſervations, ſuch as may be of uſe in examining the beauty of ſingle objects.</p>
            <p>A multitude of objects crowding into the mind at once, diſturb the attention, and paſs without making any impreſſion, or any laſting impreſſion. In a group, no ſingle object makes the figure it would do apart, when it occupies the whole attention<note n="*" place="bottom">See the appendix, containing definitions and explanation of terms.</note>. For the ſame reaſon, even a ſingle object, when it divides the attention by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of its parts, equals not, in ſtrength of impreſſion, a more ſimple object com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0258100201:259"/>
in a ſingle view. Parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely complex muſt be conſidered in por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſucceſſively; and a number of impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in ſucceſſion, which cannot unite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſimultaneous, never touch the mind like one entire impreſſion made as it were at one ſtroke. This juſtifies ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in works of art, as oppoſed to compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated circumſtances and crowded orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There is an additional reaſon for ſimplicity, in works that make an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of dignity or elevation. The mind at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to beauties of a high rank, cannot deſcend to inferior beauties. And yet, notwithſtanding theſe reaſons, we find pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe decoration prevailing in works of art. But this is no argument againſt ſimplicity. For authors and architects who cannot reach the higher beauties, endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their want of genius by dealing in thoſe that are inferior. In all ages, the beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and artiſts have been governed by a taſte for ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I proceed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the beauty of figure, as ariſing from the above-mentioned particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0258100201:260"/>
uniformity, proportion, order, and ſimplicity. To exhauſt this ſubject, would of itſelf require a large volume. I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit myſelf to a few curſory remarks, as matter for future diſquiſition. To inquire why an object, by means of the particulars mentioned, appears beautiful, would I am afraid be a vain attempt. It ſeems the moſt probable opinion, that the nature of man was originally framed with a reliſh for them, in order to anſwer wiſe and good purpoſes. The final cauſes have not hitherto been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained, though they are not probably beyond our reach. One thing is clear, that regularity, uniformity, order, and ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, contribute each of them to readineſs of apprehenſion; and enable us to form more diſtinct images of objects, than can be done with the utmoſt attention where theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are not found. This final cauſe is, I acknowledge, too ſlight, to account ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily for a taſte that makes a figure ſo illuſtrious in the nature of man. That this branch of our conſtitution hath a purpoſe ſtill more important, we have great reaſon to believe. With reſpect to proportion, I
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0258100201:261"/>
am ſtill leſs ſucceſsful. In ſeveral inſtances, accurate proportion is connected with utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This in particular is the caſe of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; for thoſe that are the beſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are the ſtrongeſt and moſt active. But inſtances are ſtill more numerous, where the proportions we reliſh the moſt, have no connection, ſo far as we ſee, with utility. Writers on architecture inſiſt much upon the proportions of a column; and aſſign different proportions to the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. But no architect will maintain, that the moſt accurate proportions contribute more to uſe, than ſeveral that are leſs accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and leſs agreeable. Neither will it be maintained, that the proportions aſſigned for the length breadth and height of rooms, tend to make them the more commodious. It appears then, ſo far as we can diſcover, that we have a taſte for proportion independent altogether of utility. One thing indeed is certain, that any external object proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our taſte, is delightful. This furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es a hint. May it not be thought a good final cauſe of proportion, that it contributes to our entertainment? The author of our
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0258100201:262"/>
nature has given many ſignal proofs, that this end is not below his care. And if ſo, why ſhould we heſitate in aſſigning this as an additional final cauſe of regularity, and the other particulars above mentioned? We may be confirmed in this thought, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, that our taſte, with reſpect to theſe, is not occaſional or accidental, but uniform and univerſal, making an original branch of human nature.</p>
            <p>One might fill a volume with the effects that are produced by the endleſs combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the principles of beauty. I have room only for a ſlight ſpecimen, confined to the ſimpleſt figures. A circle and a ſquare are each of them perfectly regular, being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confined to a preciſe form, and admitting not the ſlighteſt variation. A ſquare how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is leſs beautiful than a circle, becauſe it is leſs ſimple. A circle has parts as well as a ſquare; but its parts not being diſtinct like thoſe of a ſquare, it makes one entire impreſſion; whereas the attention is divided among the ſides and angles of a ſquare. The effect of ſimplicity may be illuſtrated by another example. A ſquare, though not
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0258100201:263"/>
more regular than a hexagon or octagon, is more beautiful than either; for what other reaſon, than that a ſquare is more ſimple, and the attention leſs divided? This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning will appear ſtill more ſolid when we conſider any regular polygon of very many ſides; for of ſuch figure the mind can never have any diſtinct perception. Simplicity thus contributes to beauty.</p>
            <p>A ſquare is more beautiful than a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram. The former exceeds the latter in regularity and in uniformity of parts. But this holds with reſpect to intrinſic beauty only; for in many inſtances, utility comes in to caſt the balance on the ſide of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelogram. This figure for the doors and windows of a dwelling-houſe, is preferred becauſe of utility; and here we find the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of utility prevailing over that of regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and uniformity.</p>
            <p>A parallelogram again depends, for its beauty, on the proportion of its ſides. The beauty is loſt by a great inequality of ſides. It is alſo loſt, on the other hand, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximation toward equality. Proportion in this circumſtance degenerates into imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0258100201:264"/>
uniformity; and the figure upon the whole appears an unſucceſsful attempt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a ſquare.</p>
            <p>An equilateral triangle yields not to a ſquare in regularity nor in uniformity of parts, and it is more ſimple. But an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral triangle is leſs beautiful than a ſquare, which muſt be owing to inferiority of order in the poſition of its parts. The ſides of an equilateral triangle incline to each other in the ſame angle, which is the moſt perfect order they are ſuſceptible of. But this order is obſcure, and far from being ſo perfect as the paralleliſm of the ſides of a ſquare. Thus order contributes to the beauty of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects, not leſs than ſimplicity and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</p>
            <p>A parallelogram exceeds an equilateral triangle in the orderly diſpoſition of its parts; but being inferior in uniformity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, it is leſs beautiful.</p>
            <p>Uniformity is ſingular in one capital cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that it is apt to diſguſt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. A number of things contrived for the ſame uſe, ſuch as chairs ſpoons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too uniform. But a ſcrupulous uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0258100201:265"/>
of parts in a large garden or field, is far from being agreeable. Uniformity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong connected objects, belongs not to the preſent ſubject. It is handled in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of uniformity and variety.</p>
            <p>In all the works of nature, ſimplicity makes an illuſtrious figure. The works of the beſt artiſts are directed by it. Profuſe ornament in painting, gardening, or archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, as well as in dreſs and language, ſhows a mean or corrupted taſte.
<q>
                  <l>Poets, like painters, thus unſkill'd to trace</l>
                  <l>The naked nature and the living grace,</l>
                  <l>With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part,</l>
                  <l>And hide with ornaments their want of art.</l>
                  <bibl>Pope's Eſſay on criticiſm.</bibl>
               </q>
No one property recommends a machine more than its ſimplicity; not ſingly for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwering its purpoſe, but by appearing in itſelf more beautiful. Simplicity hath a capital effect in behaviour and manners; no other particular contributing more to gain eſteem and love. The artificial and intricate manners of modern times, have little of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0258100201:266"/>
dignity in them. General theorems, abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from their importance, are delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by their ſimplicity, and by the eaſineſs of their application to a variety of caſes. We take equal delight in the laws of motion, which, with the greateſt ſimplicity, are boundleſs in their influence.</p>
            <p>A gradual progreſs from ſimplicity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex forms and profuſe ornament, ſeems to be the fate of all the fine arts; reſembling behaviour, which from original candor and ſimplicity has degenerated into artificial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements. At preſent, written productions are crowded with words, epithets, figures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In muſic, ſentiment is neglected, for the luxury of harmony, and for difficult movement which ſurpriſes in its execution. In <hi>taſte</hi> properly ſo called, poignant ſauces with complicated mixtures of different ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, prevail among people of condition. The French, accuſtomed to the artificial red on their women's cheeks, think the modeſt colouring of nature diſplayed on a fine face altogether inſipid.</p>
            <p>The ſame tendency appears in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the arts among the ancients. Of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0258100201:267"/>
this we have traces ſtill remaining in archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture. Some veſtiges of the oldeſt Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian buildings prove them to be of the Doric order. The Ionic ſucceeded, and ſeems to have been the favourite order, while archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture was in its height of glory. The Corinthian came next in vogue: and in Greece, the buildings of that order appear moſtly to have been erected after the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans got footing there. At laſt came the Compoſite with all its extravagancies, where proportion is ſacrificed to finery and crowded ornament.</p>
            <p>But what taſte is to prevail next? for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion is in a continual flux, and taſte muſt vary with it. After rich and profuſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments become familiar, ſimplicity appears by contraſt lifeleſs and inſipid. This would be an unſurmountable obſtruction, ſhould any man of genius and taſte endeavour to reſtore ancient ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>In reviewing what is ſaid above, I am under ſome apprehenſion of an objection, which, as it may poſſibly occur to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ought to be obviated. A mountain, it will be obſerved, is an agreeable object,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0258100201:268"/>
without ſo much as the appearance of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity; and a chain of mountains ſtill more agreeable, without being arranged in any order. But theſe facts conſidered in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per light, afford not an objection. Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, order, and uniformity, are intimately connected with beauty; and in this view only, have I treated them. Every regular object, for example, muſt in reſpect of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity be beautiful. But I have not ſaid, that regularity, order, and uniformity, are eſſential to beauty, ſo as that it cannot exiſt without them. The contrary appears in the beauty of colour. Far leſs have I ſaid, that an object cannot be agreeable in any reſpect independent of theſe qualities. Grandeur, as diſtinguiſhed from beauty, requires very little regularity. This will appear more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when that article is handled. In the mean time, to ſhow the difference betwixt beauty and grandeur with reſpect to regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I ſhall give a few examples. Imagine a ſmall body, let it be a globe, in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual flux of figure, from the moſt perfect regularity till there remain no appearance of that quality. The beauty of this globe,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0258100201:269"/>
depending on its regular figure, will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually wear away with its regularity; and when it is no longer regular, it no longer will appear beautiful. The next example ſhall be of the ſame globe, gradually enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging its ſize, but retaining its figure. In this body, we at firſt perceive the beauty of regularity only. But ſo ſoon as it begins to ſwell into a great ſize, it appears agreeable by its greatneſs, which joins with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of regularity to make it a delightful object. In the laſt place, let it be imagined, that the figure as well as the quantity of matter are in a continual flux; and that the body, while it increaſes in ſize, becomes leſs and leſs regular, till it loſe altogether the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that quality. In this caſe, the beauty of regularity wearing off gradually, gives place to an agreeableneſs of a different ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> that of greatneſs: and at laſt the emotion ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from greatneſs will be in perfection, when the beauty of regularity is gone. Hence it is, that in a large object the want of regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is not much regarded by the ſpectator who is ſtruck with its grandeur. A ſwelling eminence is agreeable, though not ſtrictly
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0258100201:270"/>
regular. A towering hill is delightful, if it have but any diſtant reſemblance of a cone. A ſmall ſurface ought to be ſmooth; but in a wide-extended plain, conſiderable inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are overlooked. This obſervation holds equally in works of art. The ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt irregularity in a houſe of a moderate ſize hurts the eye; while the mind, ſtruck with the grandeur of a ſuperb edifice, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies it totally, cannot bear to deſcend to its irregularities unleſs extremely groſs. In a large volume we pardon many defects that would make an epigram intolerable. In ſhort, the obſervation holds in general, that beauty is connected with regularity in great objects as well as in ſmall; but with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable difference, that in paſſing from ſmall to great, regularity is leſs and leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>The diſtinction betwixt primary and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary qualities in matter, ſeems now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed. Heat and cold, though ſeeming to exiſt in bodies, are diſcovered to be effects cauſed by theſe bodies in a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive being. Colour, which the eye repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents as ſpread upon a ſubſtance, has no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0258100201:271"/>
but in the mind of the ſpectator. Perceptions of this kind, which, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of ſenſe, are attributed to external ſubjects, are termed <hi>ſecondary qualities,</hi> in contradiſtinction to figure, extenſion, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, which are primary qualities, and which are not ſeparable, even in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the ſubjects they belong to. This ſuggeſts a curious inquiry, Whether beauty be a primary or only a ſecondary quality of objects? The queſtion is eaſily determined with reſpect to the beauty of colour; for if colour be a ſecondary quality exiſting no where but in the mind of the ſpectator, its beauty muſt be of the ſame kind. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion muſt alſo hold with reſpect to the beauty of utility, which is plainly a concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, ariſing not merely from ſight, but from reflecting that the thing is fitted for ſome good end or purpoſe. The queſtion is more intricate with reſpect to the beauty of regularity. If regularity be a primary quality, why not alſo its beauty? That this is not a good conſequence, will appear from conſidering, that beauty, in its very conception, refers to a percipient; for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0258100201:272"/>
an object is ſaid to be beautiful, for no other reaſon but that it appears ſo to a ſpectator. The ſame piece of matter which to man appears beautiful, may poſſibly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other being appear ugly. Beauty therefore, which for its exiſtence depends upon the percipient as much as upon the object percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, cannot be an inherent property of either. What elſe then can it be, but a perception in the mind occaſioned by certain objects? The ſame reaſoning is applicable to the beauty of order, of uniformity, of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. Accordingly, it may be pronounced in general, that beauty in no caſe whatever is a real quality of matter. And hence it is wittily obſerved by the poet, that beauty is not in the countenance, but in the lover's eye. This reaſoning is undoubtedly ſolid: and the only cauſe of doubt or heſitation is, that we are taught a different leſſon by ſenſe. By a ſingular determination of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we perceive both beauty and colour as belonging to the object; and, like figure or extenſion, as inherent properties. This mechaniſm is uncommon; and when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to fulfil her intention, chuſeth any
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0258100201:273"/>
ſingular method of operation, we may be certain of ſome final cauſe that cannot be reached by ordinary means. It appears to me, that a perception of beauty in external objects, is requiſite to attach us to them. Doth not this mechaniſm, in the firſt place, greatly promote induſtry, by prompting a deſire to poſſeſs things that are beautiful? Doth it not further join with utility, in prompting us to embelliſh our houſes and enrich our fields? Theſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are but ſlight effects, compared with the connections which are formed among individuals in ſociety by means of this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular mechaniſm. The qualifications of the head and heart, are undoubtedly the moſt ſolid and moſt permanent foundations of ſuch connections. But as external beauty lies more in view, and is more obvious to the bulk of mankind than the qualities now mentioned, the ſenſe of beauty poſſeſſes the more univerſal influence in forming theſe connections. At any rate, it concurs in an eminent degree with mental qualifications, to produce ſocial intercourſe, mutual good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0258100201:274"/>
and conſequently mutual aid and ſupport, which are the life of ſociety.</p>
            <p>It muſt not however be overlooked, that this ſenſe doth not tend to advance the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of ſociety, but when in a due mean with reſpect to ſtrength. Love in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ariſing from a ſenſe of beauty, loſes, when exceſſive, its ſociable character<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 2. part 1. ſect. 1.</note>. The appetite for gratification, prevailing over affection for the beloved object, is ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable; and tends violently to its end, regardleſs of the miſery that muſt follow. Love in this ſtate is no longer a ſweet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable paſſion. It becomes painful like hunger or thirſt; and produceth no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs but in the inſtant of fruition. This diſcovery ſuggeſts a moſt important leſſon, that moderation in our deſires and appetites, which fits us for doing our duty, contributes at the ſame time the moſt to happineſs. Even ſocial paſſions, when mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, are more pleaſant than when they ſwell beyond proper bounds.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Grandeur and Sublimity.</head>
            <p>NATURE hath not more remarkably diſtinguiſhed us from the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals by an erect poſture, than by a capacious and aſpiring mind, inclining us to every thing great and elevated. The ocean, the ſky, or any large object, ſeizes the attention, and makes a ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Longinus obſerves, that nature inclines us to admire, not a ſmall rivulet, however clear and tranſparent, but the Nile, the Iſter, the Rhine, or ſtill more the ocean. The ſight of a ſmall fire produceth no emotion; but we are ſtruck with the boiling furnaces of Aetna, pouring out whole rivers of liquid flame. <hi>Treatiſe of the Sublime, chap.</hi> 29.</p>
               </note>. Robes of ſtate are made large and full to draw reſpect. We admire elephants and whales for their magnitude, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their unwieldineſs.</p>
            <p>The elevation of an object affects us not leſs than its magnitude. A high place is choſen for the ſtatue of a deity or hero.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0258100201:276"/>
A tree growing upon the brink of a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice viewed from the plain below, affords by that circumſtance an additional pleaſure. A throne is erected for the chief magiſtrate, and a chair with a high ſeat for the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of a court.</p>
            <p>In ſome objects, greatneſs and elevation concur to make a complicated impreſſion. The Alps and the pike of Teneriff are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per examples; with the following differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in the former greatneſs ſeems to prevail, elevation in the latter.</p>
            <p>The emotions raiſed by great and by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated objects, are clearly diſtinguiſhable, not only in the internal feeling, but even in their external expreſſions. A great object dilates the breaſt, and makes the ſpectator endeavour to enlarge his bulk. This is remarkable in perſons, who, neglecting delicacy in behaviour, give way to nature without reſerve. In deſcribing a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they naturally expand themſelves by drawing in air with all their force. An e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated object produces a different expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It makes the ſpectator ſtretch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſtand a tiptoe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0258100201:277"/>
Great and elevated objects conſidered with relation to the emotions produced by them, are termed <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>ſublime.</hi> Grandeur and ſublimity have a double ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. They generally ſignify the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or circumſtance in the objects by which the emotions are produced; ſometimes the emotions themſelves.</p>
            <p>Whether magnitude ſingly in an object of ſight, have the effect to produce an emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſtinguiſhable from the beauty or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of that object; or whether it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a circumſtance modifying the beauty or deformity, is an intricate queſtion. If magnitude produce an emotion of its own diſtinguiſhable from others, this emotion muſt either be pleaſant or painful. But this ſeems to be contradicted by experience; for magnitude, as it would appear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes in ſome inſtances to beauty, in ſome to deformity. A hill, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is agreeable, and a great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtill more ſo. But an ugly monſter, the larger, the more horrid. Greatneſs in an enemy, great power, great courage, ſerve but to augment our terror. Hath not
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0258100201:278"/>
this an appearance as if grandeur were not an emotion diſtinct from all others, but only a circumſtance that qualifies beauty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity?</p>
            <p>I am notwithſtanding ſatisfied, that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur is an emotion, not only diſtinct from all others, but in every circumſtance plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. Theſe propoſitions muſt be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeparately. I begin with the former, and ſhall endeavour to prove, that magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude produceth a peculiar emotion diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from all others. Magnitude is undoubtedly a real property of bodies, not leſs than figure, and more than colour. Figure and colour, even in the ſame body, produce ſeparate emotions, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miſapprehended one for the other. Why ſhould not magnitude produce an emotion different from both? That it has this effect, will be evident from a plain experiment of two bodies, one great and one little, which produce different emotions, though they be preciſely the ſame as to figure and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. There is indeed an obſcurity in this matter, occaſioned by the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the grandeur and beauty of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0258100201:279"/>
ſame object mix ſo intimately as ſcarce to be diſtinguiſhed. But the beauty of colour comes in happily to enable us to make the diſtinction. For the emotion of colour u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites with that of figure, not leſs intimately than grandeur does with either. Yet the emotion of colour is diſtinguiſhable from that of figure; and ſo is grandeur, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſidered: though when theſe three emotions are blended together, they are ſcarce felt as different emotions.</p>
            <p>Next, that grandeur is an emotion in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very circumſtance pleaſant, appears from the following conſiderations. Magnitude or greatneſs, abſtracted from all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſwells the heart and dilates the mind. We feel this to be a pleaſant effect; and we feel no ſuch effect in contracting the mind upon little objects. This may be illuſtrated by conſidering grandeur in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Beauty is an agreeable quality, whether in a friend or enemy; and when the emotion it raiſeth is mixed with reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt an enemy, it muſt have the effect to moderate our reſentment. In the ſame manner, grandeur in an enemy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0258100201:280"/>
foftens and blunts our reſentment. Grandeur indeed may indirectly and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection produce an unpleaſant effect. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur in an enemy, like courage, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our fear, when we conſider the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he hath over us by this quality. But the ſame indirect effect may be produced by many other agreeable qualities, ſuch as beauty or wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The magnitude of an ugly object, ſerves, it is true, to augment our horror or aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But this proceeds not from magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſeparately conſidered. It proceeds from the following circumſtance, that in a large object a great quantity of ugly parts are preſented to view.</p>
            <p>The ſame chain of reaſoning is ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly applicable to ſublimity, that it would be loſing time to ſhow the application. Grandeur therefore and ſublimity ſhall hereafter be conſidered both of them as pleaſant emotions.</p>
            <p>The pleaſant emotion raiſed by large ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, has not eſcaped the poets:

unhappy for man, were an object diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from its being of a ſmall ſize merely, when he is ſurrounded with ſo many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that kind. The ſame obſervation is applicable to elevation of place. A body placed high is agreeable; but the ſame body placed low, is not by that circumſtance rendered diſagreeable. Littleneſs, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of place, are preciſely ſimilar in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particular, that they neither give pleaſure nor pain. And in this may viſibly be diſcovered peculiar attention in fitting the internal conſtitution of man to his exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal circumſtances. Were littleneſs, and lowneſs of place agreeable, greatneſs and elevation could not be ſo. Were littleneſs, and lowneſs of place diſagreeable, they would occaſion uninterrupted uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>The difference betwixt great and little with reſpect to agreeableneſs, is remarkably felt in a ſeries when we paſs gradually from the one extreme to the other. A mental progreſs from the capital to the kingdom, from that to Europe—to the whole earth—to the planetary ſyſtem—to the univerſe, is extremely pleaſant: the heart ſwells and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0258100201:286"/>
the mind is dilated, at every ſtep. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in an oppoſite direction is not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively painful, though our pleaſure leſſens at every ſtep, till it vaniſh into indifference. Such a progreſs may ſometimes produce a pleaſure of a different ſort, which ariſes from taking a narrower and narrower inſpection. The ſame obſervation is applicable to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs upward and downward. Aſcent is pleaſant becauſe it elevates us. But deſcent is never painful: it is for the moſt part plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant from a different cauſe, that it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of nature. The fall of a ſtone from anyheight, is extremely agreeable by its accelerated motion. I feel it pleaſant to deſcend from a mountain: the deſcent is natural and eaſy. Neither is looking downward painful. On the contrary, to look down upon objects, makes part of the pleaſure of elevation. Looking down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes then only painful when the object is ſo far below as to create dizzineſs: and even when that is the caſe, we feel a ſort of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure mixt with the pain.

            <p>An obſervation is made above, that the emotions of grandeur and ſublimity are nearly allied. Hence it is, that the one term is frequently put for the other. I give an example. An increaſing ſeries of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers produceth an emotion ſimilar to that of mounting upward, and for that reaſon is commonly termed <hi>an aſcending ſeries.</hi> A ſeries of numbers gradually decreaſing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth an emotion ſimilar to that of going downward, and for that reaſon is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0258100201:288"/>
termed <hi>a deſcending ſeries.</hi> We talk fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly of going up to the capital, and of going down to the country. From a leſſer kingdom we talk of going up to a greater, whence the <hi>anabaſis</hi> in the Greek language when one travels from Greece to Perſia. We diſcover the ſame way of ſpeaking in the language even of Japan<note n="*" place="bottom">Kempſer's hiſtory of Japan, b. 5. ch. 2.</note>; and its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality proves it the offspring of a natural feeling.</p>
            <p>The foregoing obſervation leads us natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to conſider grandeur and ſublimity in a figurative ſenſe, and as applicable to the fine arts. Hitherto I have conſidered theſe terms in their proper meaning, as applicable to objects of ſight only: and I thought it of importance, to beſtow ſome pains upon that article; becauſe, generally ſpeaking, the figurative ſenſe of a word is derived from its proper ſenſe; which will be found to hold in the preſent ſubject. Beauty in its original ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, is confined to objects of ſight. But as many other objects, intellectual as well as moral, raiſe emotions reſembling that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0258100201:289"/>
of beauty, the reſemblance of the effects prompts us naturally to extend the term <hi>beauty</hi> to theſe objects. This equally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for the terms <hi>grandeur</hi> and <hi>ſublimity</hi> taken in a figurative ſenſe. Every emotion, from whatever cauſe proceeding, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles an emotion of grandeur or eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is called by the ſame name. Thus generoſity is ſaid to be an elevated emotion, as well as great courage; and that firmneſs of ſoul which is ſuperior to misfortunes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the peculiar name of <hi>magnanimity.</hi> On the other hand, every emotion that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the mind and fixeth it upon things trivial or of no importance, is termed <hi>low,</hi> by its reſemblance to an emotion produced by a little or low object of ſight. Thus an appetite for trifling amuſements, is called <hi>a low taſte.</hi> The ſame terms are applied to characters and actions. We talk familiarly of an elevated genius, of a great man, and equally ſo of littleneſs of mind. Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are great and elevated, others are low and groveling. Sentiments and even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are characteriſed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. An expreſſion or ſentiment that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

                  <p>Longinus gives a pretty good deſcription of the ſublime, though not entirely juſt in every one of the circumſtances, <q rend="inline">"That the mind is elevated by it, and ſo ſenſibly affected as to ſwell in tranſport and inward pride, as if what is only heard or read, were its own invention."</q> But he adheres not to this deſcription. In his 6th chapter he juſtly obſerves, that many paſſions have nothing of the grand, ſuch as grief, fear, pity, which depreſs the mind inſtead of raiſing it. And yet in chapter 8th, he mentions Sappho's ode upon love as ſublime. Beautiful it is undoubtedly, but it cannot be ſublime, becauſe it really depreſſes the mind inſtead of raiſing it. His tranſlator Boileau is not more ſucceſsful in his inſtances. In his 10th reflection he cites a paſſage from Demoſthenes and another from Herodotus as ſublime, which are not ſo.</p>

In ſuch figurative terms, the diſtinction is loſt that is made betwixt <hi>great</hi> and <hi>elevated</hi> in their proper ſenſe; for the reſemblance is not ſo entire, as to preſerve theſe terms diſtinct in their figurative application. We carry this figure ſtill farther. Elevation in its proper ſenſe, includes ſuperiority of place; and lowneſs, inferiority of place. Hence a man of ſuperior talents, of ſuperior rank, of inferior parts, of inferior taſte, and ſuch like.

And we may remark by the way, that as words are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with ideas, many, by this form of expreſſion, are led to conceive their anceſtors as really above them in place, and their poſterity below them:
<q>
                  <l>A grandam's name is little leſs in love</l>

The notes of the gamut, proceeding regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from the blunter or groſſer ſounds to thoſe which are more acute and piercing, produce in the hearer a feeling ſomewhat ſimilar to what is produced by mounting upward; and this gives occaſion to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative expreſſions, <hi>a high note, a low note.</hi>

            <p>Such is the reſemblance in feeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt real and figurative grandeur, that among the nations on the eaſt coaſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric, who are directed purely by nature, the

different dignities of the officers of ſtate are marked by the length of the batoon each carries in his hand. And in Japan, princes and great lords ſhew their rank by the length and ſize of their ſedan-poles<note n="*" place="bottom">Kempfer's hiſtory of Japan.</note>. Again, it is a rule in painting, that figures of a ſmall ſize are proper for groteſque pieces; but that in an hiſtorical ſubject, which is grand and important, the figures ought to be as great as the life. The reſemblance of theſe feelings is in reality ſo ſtrong, that elevation in a figurative ſenſe is obſerved to have the ſame effect even externally, that real eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has: <q>

            <p>The reſemblance in feeling betwixt real and figurative grandeur, is humorouſly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by Addiſon in criticiſing upon the Engliſh tragedy. <q rend="inline">"The ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0258100201:293"/>
of making an hero, is to clap a huge plume of feathers upon his head, which riſes ſo high, that there is often a greater length from his chin to the top of his head, than to the ſole of his foot. One would believe, that we thought a great man and a tall man the ſame thing. As theſe ſuperfluous ornaments upon the head make a great man, a princeſs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receives her grandeur from thoſe additional incumbrances that fall into her tail. I mean the broad ſweeping train that follows her in all her motions, and finds conſtant employment for a boy who ſtands behind her to open and ſpread it to advantage<note n="*" place="bottom">Spectator, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 42.</note>."</q> The Scythians, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the ſame of Alexander, were aſtoniſhed when they found him a little man.</p>
            <p>A gradual progreſs from ſmall to great, is not leſs remarkable in figurative than in real grandeur or elevation. Every one muſt have obſerved the delightful effect of a number of thoughts or ſentiments, artfully
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0258100201:294"/>
diſpoſed like an aſcending ſeries, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king impreſſions ſtronger and ſtronger. Such diſpoſition of members in a period, is diſtinguiſhed by a proper name, being termed a <hi>climax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to have a juſt conception of grandeur and ſublimity, it is neceſſary to be obſerved, that within certain limits they produce their ſtrongeſt effects, which leſſen by exceſs as well as by defect. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in grandeur and ſublimity taken in their proper ſenſe. The ſtrongeſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grandeur is raiſed by an object that can be taken in at one view. An object ſo immenſe as not to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended but in parts, tends rather to diſtract than ſatisfy the mind<note n="*" place="bottom">It is juſtly obſerved by Addiſon, that perhaps a man would have been more aſtoniſhed with the majeſtic air that appeared in one of Lyſippus's ſtatues of Alexander, though no bigger than the life, than he might have been with Mount Athos, had it been cut into the figure of the hero, according to the propoſal of Phidias, with a river in one hand and a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the other. <hi>Spectator,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 415.</note> In like manner, the ſtrongeſt emotion produced by elevation is where the object is ſeen diſtinctly. A greater elevation leſſens in appearance the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0258100201:295"/>
object, till it vaniſh out of ſight with its pleaſant emotion. The ſame is equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in figurative grandeur and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhall be handled together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as obſerved above, they are ſcarce diſtinguiſhable. Sentiments may be ſo ſtrained, as to become obſcure, or to exceed the capacity of the human mind. Againſt ſuch licence of imagination, every good writer will be upon his guard. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of greater importance to obſerve, that even the true ſublime may be carried beyond that pitch which produces the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt entertainment. We are undoubtedly ſuſceptible of a greater elevation than can be inſpired by human actions the moſt heroic and magnanimous; witneſs what we feel from Milton's deſcription of ſuperior beings. Yet every man muſt be ſenſible of a more conſtant and pleaſant elevation, when the hiſtory of his own ſpecies is the ſubject. He enjoys an elevation equal to that of the greateſt hero, of an Alexander or a Caeſar, of a Brutus or an Epaminondas. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies theſe heroes in their ſublimeſt ſentiments and moſt hazardous exploits,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0258100201:296"/>
with a magnanimity equal to theirs; and finds it no ſtretch to preſerve the ſame tone of mind for hours together, without ſinking. The caſe is by no means the ſame in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the actions or qualities of ſuperior beings. The reader's imagination cannot keep pace with that of the poet; and the mind, unable to ſupport itſelf in a ſtrained elevation, falls as from a height; and the fall is immoderate like the elevation. Where this effect is not felt, it muſt be prevented by ſome obſcurity in the conception, which frequently attends the deſcription of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known objects.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, objects of ſight that are not remarkably great or high, ſcarce raiſe any emotion of grandeur or ſublimity; and the ſame holds in other objects. The mind is often rouſed and animated without being carried to the height of grandeur or ſublimity. This difference may be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many ſorts of muſic, as well as in ſome muſical inſtruments. A kettledrum rouſes, and a hautboy is animating; but neither of them inſpire an emotion of ſublimity. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge animates the mind in a conſiderable
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0258100201:297"/>
degree; but I think it never produceth an emotion that can be termed <hi>grand</hi> or <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime</hi>; and I ſhall have occaſion afterward to obſerve, that no diſagreeable paſſion ever has this effect. I am willing to put this to the teſt, by placing before my reader the moſt ſpirited picture of revenge ever drawn. It is a ſpeech of Antony wailing over the body of Caeſar.<q>
                  <l>Wo to the hand that ſhed this coſtly blood!</l>
                  <l>Over thy wounds now do I propheſy,</l>
                  <l>(Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,</l>
                  <l>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue),</l>
                  <l>A curſe ſhall light upon the kind of men;</l>
                  <l>Domeſtic fury, and fierce civil ſtrife,</l>

When the ſublime is carried to its due height and circumſcribed within proper bounds, it inchants the mind and raiſes the moſt delightful of all emotions. The read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ingroſſed by a ſublime object, feels himſelf raiſed as it were to a higher rank. When ſuch is the caſe, it is not wonderful that the hiſtory of conquerors and heroes ſhould be univerſally the favourite entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this fairly accounts for what I once erroneouſly ſuſpected to be a wrong bias originally in human nature. The groſſeſt acts of oppreſſion and injuſtice, ſcarce blemiſh the character of a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. We notwithſtanding warmly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe his intereſt, accompany him in his exploits, and are anxious for his ſucceſs. The ſplendor and enthuſiaſm of the hero transfuſed into the readers, elevate their minds far above the rules of juſtice, and render them in a great meaſure inſenſible of the wrong that is done:

            <p>The attachment we have to things grand or lofty may be thought to proceed from an unwearied inclination we have to be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. No deſire is more univerſal than to be reſpected and honoured. Upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count chiefly, are we ambitious of power, riches, titles, fame, which would ſuddenly loſe their reliſh, did they not raiſe us above others, and command ſubmiſſion and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </p>
               </note>. But the preference given to things grand and ſublime muſt have a deeper root in human nature. Many beſtow their time
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0258100201:300"/>
upon low and trifling amuſements, without ſhowing any deſire to be exalted. Yet theſe very perſons talk the ſame language with the reſt of mankind; and at leaſt in their judgement, if not in their taſte, prefer the more elevated pleaſures. They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a more refined taſte, and are aſhamed of their own as low and groveling. This ſentiment, conſtant and univerſal, muſt be the work of nature; and it plainly indicates an original attachment in human nature to every object that elevates the mind. Some men may have a greater reliſh for an object not of the higheſt rank: but they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the common nature of man, and that it ought not to be ſubjected to their peculiar taſte.</p>
            <p>The irregular influence of grandeur, reaches alſo to other matters. However good, honeſt, or uſeful, a man may be, he is not ſo much reſpected, as one of a more elevated character is, though of leſs integrity; nor do the misfortunes of the former affect us ſo much as thoſe of the latter. I add, becauſe it cannot be diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the remorſe which attends breach
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0258100201:301"/>
of engagement, is in a great meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the figure that the injured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon makes. The vows and proteſtations of lovers are an illuſtrious example of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; for theſe commonly are little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded when made to women of inferior rank.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid ſuggeſts a capital rule for reaching the ſublime in ſuch works of art as are ſuſceptible of it; and that is, to put in view thoſe parts or circumſtances only which make the greateſt figure, keeping out of ſight every thing that is low or trivial. Such judicious ſelection of capital circumſtances, is by an eminent critic ſtyled <hi>grandeur of manner</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Spectator, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 415.</note>. The mind, from an elevation inſpired by important objects, cannot, without reluctance, be forced down to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow any ſhare of its attention upon trifles. In none of the fine arts is there ſo great ſcope for this rule as in poetry, which, by that means, enjoys a remarkable power of beſtowing upon objects and events an air of grandeur. When we are ſpectators, every
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0258100201:302"/>
minute object preſents itſelf in its order. But in deſcribing at ſecond hand, theſe are laid aſide, and the capital objects are brought cloſe together. A judicious taſte in ſelecting, after this manner, the moſt intereſting incidents to give them an united force, accounts for a fact which at firſt ſight may appear ſurpriſing, that we are more moved by a poetical narrative at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand, than when we are ſpectators of the event itſelf in all its circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Longinus exemplifies the foregoing rule by a compariſon of two paſſages<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 8. of the Sublime.</note>. The firſt from Ariſtaeus is thus tranſlated.

            <p>To theſe I venture to oppoſe a paſſage from an old hiſtorical ballad:
<q>
                  <l>Go, little page, tell Hardiknute</l>
                  <l>That lives on hill ſo high<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>High,</hi> in the old Scotch language, is pronounced <hi>hee.</hi>
                     </note>,</l>
                  <l>To draw his ſword, the dread of faes,</l>
                  <l>And haſte to follow me.</l>
                  <l>The little page flew ſwift as dart</l>
                  <l>Flung by his maſter's arm.</l>
                  <l>Come down, come down, Lord Hardiknute,</l>
                  <l>And rid your king from harm.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This rule is alſo applicable to other fine arts. In painting it is eſtabliſhed, that the principal figure muſt be put in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt light; that the beauty of attitude conſiſts in placing the nobler parts moſt in view, and in ſuppreſſing the ſmaller parts as much as poſſible; that the folds of the drapery muſt be few and large; that foreſhortenings are bad, becauſe they make the parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0258100201:307"/>
little; and that the muſcles ought to be kept as entire as poſſible, without being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſmall ſections. Every one at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is ſenſible of the importance of this rule when applied to gardening, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the antiquated taſte of parterres ſplit into a thouſand ſmall parts in the ſtricteſt regularity of figure. Thoſe who have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded beſt in architecture, have governed themſelves by this rule in all their models.</p>
            <p>Another rule chiefly regards the ſublime, though it may be applied to every literary performance intended for amuſement; and that is, to avoid as much as poſſible abſtract and general terms. Such terms, perfectly well fitted for reaſoning and for conveying inſtruction, ſerve but imperfectly the ends of poetry. They ſtand upon the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with mathematical ſigns, contrived to expreſs our thoughts in a conciſe manner. But images, which are the life of poetry, cannot be raiſed in any perfection, otherwiſe than by introducing particular objects. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, that comprehend a number of individuals, muſt be excepted from this rule. Our kindred, our clan, our country,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0258100201:308"/>
and words of the like import, though they ſcarce raiſe any image, have notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wonderful power over our paſſions. The greatneſs of the complex object over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balances the obſcurity of the image.</p>
            <p>What I have further to ſay upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſhall be comprehended in a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations. A man is capable of being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo much above his ordinary pitch by an emotion of grandeur, that it is extremely difficult by a ſingle thought or expreſſion to produce that emotion in perfection. The riſe muſt be gradual and the reſult of reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated impreſſions. The effect of a ſingle expreſſion can be but momentary; and if one feel ſuddenly ſomewhat like a ſwelling or exaltation of mind, the emotion vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as ſoon as felt. Single expreſſions, I know, are often juſtly cited as examples of the ſublime. But then their effect is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing compared with a grand ſubject diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in its capital parts. I ſhall give a few examples, that the reader may judge for himſelf. In the famous action of Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylae, where Leonidas the Spartan King with his choſen band fighting for their
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0258100201:309"/>
country, were cut off to the laſt man, a ſaying is reported of Dieneces one of the band, which, expreſſing chearful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed bravery, is well intitled to the firſt place in examples of this kind. Talking of the number of their enemies, it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the arrows ſhot by ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would intercept the light of the ſun. So much the better, ſays he; for we ſhall then fight in the ſhade<note n="*" place="bottom">Herodotus, book 7.</note>.

Such a ſentiment from a man expiring of his wounds, is truly heroic, and muſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the mind to the greateſt height that can be done by a ſingle expreſſion. It will not
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0258100201:310"/>
ſuffer in a compariſon with the famous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent <hi>Qu'il mourut</hi> in Corneille's Horace. The latter is a ſentiment of indignation merely, the former of invincible fortitude.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to theſe examples, to cite many a ſublime paſſage, enriched with the fineſt images, and dreſſed in the moſt ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous expreſſions, would ſcarce be fair. I ſhall produce but one inſtance from Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear, which ſets a few objects before the eye, without much pomp of language. It works its effect, by repreſenting theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in a climax, raiſing the mind higher and higher till it feel the emotion of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur in perfection.
<q>
                  <l>The cloud-capt tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces,</l>
                  <l>The ſolemn temples, the great globe itſelf,</l>
                  <l>Yea all which it inherit, ſhall diſſolve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <hi>The cloud-capt tow'rs</hi> produce an elevating emotion, heightened by the <hi>gorgeous palaces.</hi> And the mind is carried ſtill higher and higher by the images that follow. Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive images, making thus ſtronger and ſtronger impreſſions, muſt elevate more than any ſingle image can do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0258100201:311"/>
I proceed to another obſervation. In the chapter of beauty it is remarked, that regularity is required in ſmall figures, and order in ſmall groups; but that in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing gradually from ſmall to great, regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and order are leſs and leſs required. This remark ſerves to explain the extreme delight we have in viewing the face of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when ſufficiently enriched and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified by objects. The bulk of the objects ſeen in a natural landſcape are beautiful, and ſome of them grand. A flowing river, a ſpreading oak, a round hill, an extended plain, are delightful; and even a rugged rock or barren heath, though in themſelves diſagreeable, contribute by contraſt to the beauty of the whole. Joining to theſe, the verdure of the fields, the mixture of light and ſhade, and the ſublime canopy ſpread over all; it will not appear wonderful, that ſo extenſive a group of glorious objects ſhould ſwell the heart to its utmoſt bounds, and raiſe the ſtrongeſt emotion of grandeur. The ſpectator is conſcious of an enthuſiaſm, which cannot bear confinement nor the ſtrictneſs of regularity and order. He loves
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0258100201:312"/>
to range at large; and is ſo inchanted with ſhining objects, as to neglect ſlight beauties or defects. Thus it is, that the delightful emotion of grandeur, depends little on order and regularity. And when the emotion is at its height by a ſurvey of the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, order and regularity are almoſt totally diſregarded.</p>
            <p>The ſame obſervation is applicable in ſome meaſure to works of art. In a ſmall building the ſlighteſt irregularity is diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. In a magnificent palace or a large Gothic church, irregularities are leſs regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In an epic poem we pardon many negligences, which would be intolerable in a ſonnet or epigram. Notwithſtanding ſuch exceptions, it may be juſtly laid down for a rule, That in all works of art, order and regularity ought to be governing principles. And hence the obſervation of Longinus<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 30.</note>, <q rend="inline">"In works of art we have regard to exact proportion; in thoſe of nature, to gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and magnificence."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall add but one other obſervation,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0258100201:313"/>
That no means can be more ſucceſsfully employed to ſink and depreſs the mind than grandeur or ſublimity. By the artful intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of an humbling object, the fall is great in proportion to the former elevation. Of this doctrine Shakeſpear affords us a beautiful illuſtration, in a paſſage part of which is cited above for another purpoſe:
<q>
                  <l>The cloud-capt tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces,</l>
                  <l>The ſolemn temples, the great globe itſelf,</l>
                  <l>Yea all which it inherit, ſhall diſſolve,</l>
                  <l>And like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion</l>
                  <l>Leave not a rack behind—</l>
                  <bibl>Tempeſt, act 4. ſc. 4.</bibl>
               </q>
The elevation of the mind in the former part of this beautiful paſſage, makes the fall great in proportion when the moſt humbling of all images is introduced, that of an utter diſſolution of the earth and its inhabitants. A ſentiment makes not the ſame impreſſion in a cool ſtate, that it does when the mind is warmed; and a depreſſing or melancholy ſentiment makes the ſtrongeſt impreſſion, when it brings down the mind from its higheſt ſtate of elevation or chearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0258100201:314"/>
This indirect effect of elevation to ſink the mind, is ſometimes produced without the intervention of any humbling image. There was occaſion above to remark, that in deſcribing ſuperior beings, the reader's imagination, unable to ſupport itſelf in a ſtrained elevation, falls often as from a height, and ſinks even below its ordinary tone. The following inſtance comes lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in view; for a better illuſtration cannot be given: <q rend="inline">"God ſaid, Let there be light, and there was light."</q> Longinus cites this paſſage from Moſes as a ſhining exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ſublime; and it is ſcarce poſſible in fewer words, to convey ſo clear an image of the infinite power of the Deity. But then it belongs to the preſent ſubject to remark, that the emotion of ſublimity raiſed by this image is but momentary; and that the mind, unable to ſupport itſelf in an eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo much above nature, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinks down into humility and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a being ſo far exalted above us groveling mortals. Every one is acquainted with a diſpute about this paſſage betwixt
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0258100201:315"/>
two French critics<note n="*" place="bottom">Boileau and Huet.</note>, the one poſitively affirming, the other as poſitively deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it to be ſublime. What I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, ſhows that both of them have reached the truth, but neither of them the whole truth. Every one of taſte muſt be ſenſible, that the primary effect of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is an emotion of grandeur. This ſo far juſtifies Boileau. But then every one of taſte muſt be equally ſenſible, that the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is merely a flaſh, which vaniſheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and gives way to the deepeſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and veneration. This indirect effect of ſublimity, juſtifies Huet on the other hand, who being a man of true piety, and perhaps of inferior imagination, felt the humbling paſſions more ſenſibly than his antagoniſt. And even laying aſide any peculiarity of character, Huet's opinion may I think be defended as the more ſolid; upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account, that in ſuch images, the depreſſing emotions are the more ſenſibly felt, and have the longer endurance.</p>
            <p>The ſtraining an elevated ſubject beyond
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0258100201:316"/>
due bounds and beyond the reach of an ordinary conception, is not a vice ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as to require the correction of criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. But falſe ſublime is a rock which writers of more fire than judgement gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſplit on. And therefore a collection of examples may be of uſe as a beacon to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture adventurers. One ſpecies of falſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, known by the name of <hi>bombaſt,</hi> is common among writers of a mean genius. It is a ſerious endeavour, by ſtrained deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to raiſe a low or familiar ſubject above its rank; which inſtead of being ſublime, never fails to be ridiculous. I am extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible how prone the mind is, in ſome animating paſſions, to magnify its objects beyond natural bounds. But ſuch hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical deſcription has its limits. If carried beyond the impulſe of the propenſity, the colouring no longer pleaſes: it degenerates into the burleſque. Take the following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.

            <head>CHAP. V. Motion and Force.</head>
            <p>THAT motion is agreeable to the eye without relation to purpoſe or deſign, may appear from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement it gives to infants. Juvenile ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes are reliſhed chiefly upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>If to ſee a body in motion be agreeable, one will be apt to conclude, that to ſee it at reſt is diſagreeable. But we learn from experience, that this would be a raſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Reſt is one of thoſe circumſtances that are neither agreeable nor diſagreeable. It is viewed with perfect indifferency. And happy it is for mankind that the matter is ſo ordered. If reſt were agreeable, it would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incline us to motion, by which all things are performed. If it were diſagreeable, it would be a ſource of perpetual uneaſineſs; for the bulk of the things we ſee appear to be at
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0258100201:323"/>
reſt. A ſimilar inſtance of deſigning wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom I have had occaſion to explain, in oppoſing grandeur to littleneſs, and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lowneſs of place<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 4.</note>. Even in the ſimpleſt matters, the finger of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. The happy adjuſtment of the internal nature of man to his external circumſtances, diſplayed in the inſtances here given, is indeed admirable.</p>
            <p>Motion is certainly agreeable in all its varieties of quickneſs and ſlowneſs. But motion long continued admits ſome excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That degree of continued motion which correſponds to the natural courſe of our perceptions, is the moſt agreeable<note n="†" place="bottom">See chap. 9.</note>. The quickeſt motion is for an inſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. But it ſoon appears to be too ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid. It becomes painful, by forcibly acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating the courſe of our perceptions. Slow continued motion becomes diſagreeable for an oppoſite reaſon, that it retards the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral courſe of our perceptions.</p>
            <p>There are other varieties in motion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0258100201:324"/>
quickneſs and ſlowneſs, that make it more or leſs agreeable. Regular motion is preferred before what is irregular, witneſs the motion of the planets in orbits nearly circular. The motion of the comets in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits leſs regular, is leſs agreeable.</p>
            <p>Motion uniformly accelerated, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling an aſcending ſeries of numbers, is more agreeable than when uniformly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded. Motion upward is agreeable by the elevation of the moving body. What then ſhall we ſay of downward motion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly accelerated by the force of gravity, compared with upward motion regularly retarded by the ſame force? Which of theſe is the moſt agreeable? This queſtion is not eaſily ſolved.</p>
            <p>Motion in a ſtraight line is no doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. But we prefer undulating mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as of waves, of a flame, of a ſhip under ſail. Such motion is more free, and alſo more natural. Hence the beauty of a ſerpentine river.</p>
            <p>The eaſy and ſliding motion of fluids, from the lubricity and incoherence of their parts, is agreeable upon that account. But
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0258100201:325"/>
the agreeableneſs chiefly depends upon the following circumſtance, that the motion is perceived, not as of one body, but as of an endleſs number moving together with order and regularity. Poets ſtruck with this beauty, draw more images from fluids than from ſolids.</p>
            <p>Force is of two kinds; one quieſcent, and one exerted by motion. The former, dead weight for example, muſt be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; for a body at reſt is not by that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance either agreeable or diſagreeable. Moving force only belongs to the preſent ſubject; and though it is not ſeparable from motion, yet by the power of abſtraction, either of them may be conſidered independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the other Both of them are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe both of them include activity. It is agreeable to ſee a thing move: to ſee it moved, as when it is dragged or puſhed along, is neither agreeable nor diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, more than when at reſt. It is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſee a thing exert force; but it makes not the thing either agreeable or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to ſee force exerted upon it.</p>
            <p>Though motion and force are each of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0258100201:326"/>
them agreeable, the impreſſions they make are different. This difference, clearly felt, is not eaſily deſcribed. All we can ſay is, that the emotion raiſed by a moving body, reſembles its cauſe: it feels as if the mind were carried along. The emotion raiſed by force exerted, reſembles alſo its cauſe: it feels as if force were exerted within the mind.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this difference, I give the following examples. It has been explained why ſmoke aſcending in a calm day, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe from a cottage in a wood, is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able object<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 1.</note>. Landſcape-painters are fond of this object, and introduce it upon all occaſions. As the aſcent is natural and without effort, it is delightful in a calm ſtate of mind. It makes an impreſſion of the ſame ſort with that of a gently-flowing river, but more agreeable, becauſe aſcent is more to our taſte than deſcent. A fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work or a <hi>jet d'eau</hi> rouſes the mind more; becauſe the beauty of force viſibly exerted, is ſuperadded to that of upward motion.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0258100201:327"/>
To a man reclining indolently upon a bank of flowers, aſcending ſmoke in a ſtill morning is delightful. But a fire-work or a <hi>jet d'eau</hi> rouſes him from this ſupine poſture, and puts him in motion.</p>
            <p>A <hi>jet d'eau</hi> makes an impreſſion diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from that of a water-fall. Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motion being natural and without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, tends rather to quiet the mind than to rouſe it. Upward motion, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, overcoming the reſiſtance of gravity, makes an impreſſion of a great effort, and thereby rouſes and enlivens the mind.</p>
            <p>The public games of the Greeks and Romans, which gave ſo much entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſpectators, conſiſted chiefly in exerting force, wreſtling, leaping, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great ſtones, and ſuch like trials of ſtrength. When great force is exerted, the effort felt within the mind produces great life and vivacity. The effort may be ſuch, as in ſome meaſure to overpower the mind. Thus the exploſion of gun-powder, the violence of a torrent, the weight of a mountain, and the cruſh of an earthquake, create aſtoniſhment rather than pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0258100201:328"/>
No quality nor circumſtance contributes more to grandeur than force, eſpecially as exerted by ſenſible beings. I cannot make this more evident than by the following ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>

            <p>We ſhall now conſider the effect of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and force in conjunction. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the planetary ſyſtem, what ſtrikes us the moſt, is the ſpherical figures of the planets and their regular motions. The conception we have of their activity
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0258100201:330"/>
and enormous bulk is more obſcure. The beauty accordingly of this ſyſtem, raiſes a more lively emotion than its grandeur. But if we could imagine ourſelves ſpectators comprehending the whole ſyſtem at one view, the activity and irreſiſtible force of theſe immenſe bodies would fill us with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement. Nature cannot furniſh another ſcene ſo grand.</p>
            <p>Motion and force, agreeable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are alſo agreeable by their utility when employed as means to accompliſh ſome beneficial end. Hence the ſuperior beauty of ſome machines, where force and motion concur to perform the work of numberleſs hands. Hence the beautiful motions, firm and regular, of a horſe train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for war. Every ſingle ſtep is the fitteſt that can be for obtaining the end propoſed. But the grace of motion is viſible chiefly in man, not only for the reaſons mentioned, but alſo becauſe every geſture is ſignificant. The power however of agreeable motion is not a common talent. Every limb of the human body has a good and a bad, an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and diſagreeable action. Some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0258100201:331"/>
are extremely graceful, others are plain and vulgar: ſome expreſs dignity, others meanneſs. But the pleaſure here, ariſing not ſingly from the beauty of motion, but from indicating character and ſentiment, belongs to a different chapter<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 15.</note>.</p>
            <p>I ſhould conclude with the final cauſe of the reliſh we have for motion and force, were it not ſo evident as to require no explanation. We are placed here in ſuch circumſtances as to make induſtry eſſential to our well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being; for without induſtry the plaineſt neceſſaries of life are not to be obtained. When our ſituation therefore in this world requires activity and a conſtant exertion of motion and force, Providence indulgently provides for our welfare in making theſe agreeable to us. It would be a blunder in our nature, to make things diſagreeable that we depend on for exiſtence; and even to make them indifferent, would tend to make us relax greatly from that degree of activity which is indiſpenſable.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. Novelty, and the unexpected ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of objects.</head>
            <p>OF all the particulars that contribute to raiſe emotions, not excepting beauty, or even greatneſs, novelty hath the moſt powerful influence. A new ſpectacle attracts multitudes. It produceth inſtantaneouſly an emotion which totally occupies the mind, and for a time excludes all other objects. The ſoul ſeems to meet the ſtrange appearance with a certain elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of itſelf; and all is huſhed in cloſe contemplation. In ſome inſtances, there is perceived a degree of agony, attended with external ſymptoms extremely expreſſive. Converſation among the vulgar never is more intereſting, than when it runs upon ſtrange objects and extraordinary events. Men tear themſelves from their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in ſearch of things rare and new; and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0258100201:333"/>
curioſity converts into a pleaſure, the fatigues, and even perils of travelling. To what cauſe ſhall we aſcribe theſe ſingular appearances? The plain account of the matter follows. Curioſity is implanted in human nature, for a purpoſe extremely beneficial, that of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring knowledge. New and ſtrange ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, above all others, excite our curioſity; and its gratification is the emotion above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, known by the name of <hi>wonder.</hi> This emotion is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Novelty where-ever found, whether in a quality or action, is the cauſe of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: admiration is directed upon the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator who performs any thing wonderful.</p>
            <p>During infancy, every new object is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the occaſion of wonder, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; becauſe, during infancy, every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at firſt is ſtrange as well as new. But as objects are rendered familiar by cuſtom, we ceaſe by degrees to wonder at new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances that have any reſemblance to what we are acquainted with. A thing muſt be ſingular as well as new, to excite our curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and to raiſe our wonder. To ſave mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying words, I would be underſtood to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0258100201:334"/>
comprehend both circumſtances when I hereafter talk of novelty.</p>
            <p>In an ordinary train of perceptions where one thing introduces another, not a ſingle object makes its appearance unexpectedly<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 1.</note>. The mind thus prepared for the reception of its objects, admits them one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without perturbation. But when a thing breaks in unexpectedly and without the preparation of any connection, it raiſes a ſingular emotion known by the name of <hi>ſurpriſe.</hi> This emotion may be produced by the moſt familiar object, as when one accidentally meets a friend who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be dead; or a man in high life, lately a beggar. On the other hand, a new object, however ſtrange, will not produce this emotion if the ſpectator be prepared for the ſight. An elephant in India will not ſurpriſe a traveller who goes to ſee one; and yet its novelty will raiſe his wonder. An Indian in Britain would be much ſurpriſed to ſtumble upon an elephant feeding at large in the open fields; but the creature
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0258100201:335"/>
itſelf, to which he was accuſtomed, would not raiſe his wonder.</p>
            <p>Surpriſe thus in ſeveral reſpects differs from wonder. Unexpectedneſs is the cauſe of the former emotion: novelty is the cauſe of the latter. Nor differ they leſs in their nature and circumſtances, as will be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by and by. With relation to one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance they perfectly agree, which is the ſhortneſs of their duration. The inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous production of theſe emotions in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, may contribute to this effect, in conformity to a general law, That things ſoon decay which ſoon come to perfection. The violence of the emotions may alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute; for an ardent emotion, which is not ſuſceptible of increaſe, cannot have a long courſe. But their ſhort duration is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned chiefly by that of their cauſes. We are ſoon reconciled to an object, however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected; and novelty ſoon degenerates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to familiarity.</p>
            <p>Whether theſe emotions be pleaſant or painful, is not a clear point. It may appear ſtrange, that our own feelings and their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital qualities ſhould afford any matter for a
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0258100201:336"/>
doubt. But when we are ingroſſed by any emotion, there is no place for ſpeculation; and when ſufficiently calm for ſpeculation, it is not eaſy to recal the emotion with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient accuracy. New objects are ſometimes terrible, ſometimes delightful. The terror which a tyger inſpires is greateſt at firſt, and wears off gradually by familiarity. On the other hand, even women will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it is novelty which pleaſes the moſt in a new faſhion. At this rate, it ſhould be thought, that wonder is not in itſelf pleaſant or painful, but that it aſſumes either quality according to circumſtances. This doctrine, however plauſible, muſt not paſs without examination. And when we reflect upon the principle of curioſity and its operations, a glimpſe of light gives ſome faint view of a different theory. Our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity is never more thoroughly gratified, than by new and ſingular objects. That very gratification is the emotion of wonder, which therefore, according to the analogy of nature, ought always to be pleaſant<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 2. part 1. ſect. 2.</note>.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0258100201:337"/>
And indeed it would be a great defect in human nature, were the gratification of ſo uſeful a principle unpleaſant. But upon a more ſtrict ſcrutiny, we ſhall not have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to mark curioſity as an exception from the general rule. A new object, it is true, that hath a threatening appearance, adds to our terror by its novelty. But from this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment it doth not follow, that novelty is in itſelf diſagreeable. It is perfectly conſiſtent, that we ſhould be delighted with an object in one view, and terrified with it in another. A river in flood ſwelling over its banks, is a grand and delightful object; and yet it may produce no ſmall degree of fear when we attempt to croſs it. Courage and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity are agreeable; and yet when we view theſe qualities in an enemy, they ſerve to increaſe our terror<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 4.</note>. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, novelty has two effects clearly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from each other. A new object, by gratifying curioſity, muſt always be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. It may, at the ſame time, have an oppoſite effect indirectly, which is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire

terror. For when a new object ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in any degree dangerous, our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of its powers and qualities affords am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſcope for the imagination to dreſs it in the moſt frightful colours<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſays on the principles of morality and natural religion, part 2. eſſ. 6.</note>. Thus the firſt ſight of a lion at ſome diſtance, may at the ſame inſtant produce two oppoſite feelings, the pleaſant emotion of wonder, and the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſion of terror. The novelty of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, produces the former directly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the latter indirectly. Thus, when the ſubject is analized, we find, that the power which novelty hath indirectly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame terror, is perfectly conſiſtent with its being in every caſe agreeable. The matter may be put in a ſtill clearer light by varying the ſcene. If a lion be firſt ſeen from a place of ſafety, the ſpectacle is altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable without the leaſt mixture of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. If again the firſt ſight put us within reach of this dangerous animal, our terror may be ſo great as quite to exclude any ſenſe of novelty. But this fact proves not
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0258100201:339"/>
that wonder is painful: it proves only that wonder may be excluded by a more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſion. And yet it is this fact, which, in ſuperficial thinking, has thrown the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject into obſcurity. I preſume we may now boldly affirm, that wonder is in every caſe a pleaſant emotion. This is acknowledged as to all new objects that appear inoffenſive. And even as to objects that appear offenſive, I urge that the ſame muſt hold ſo long as the ſpectator can attend to the novelty.</p>
            <p>Whether ſurpriſe be in itſelf pleaſant or painful, is a queſtion not leſs intricate than the former. It is certain, that ſurpriſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames our joy when unexpectedly we meet with an old friend: and not leſs our terror, when we ſtumble upon any thing noxious. To clear this point, we muſt trace it ſtep by ſtep. And the firſt thing to be remarked is, that in ſome inſtances an unexpected ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject overpowers the mind ſo as to produce a momentary ſtupefaction. An unexpected object, not leſs than one that is new, is apt to ſound an alarm and to raiſe terror. Man, naturally a defenceleſs being, is happily ſo conſtituted as to apprehend danger in all
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0258100201:340"/>
doubtful caſes. Accordingly, where the object is dangerous, or appears ſo, the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den alarm it gives, without preparation, is apt totally to unhinge the mind, and for a moment to ſuſpend all the faculties, even thought itſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">Hence the Latin names for ſurpriſe, <hi>torpor, animi ſtupor.</hi>
               </note>. In this ſtate a man is quite helpleſs; and if he move at all, is as likely to run upon the danger as from it. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe carried to this height, cannot be either pleaſant or painful; becauſe the mind, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch momentary ſtupefaction, is in a good meaſure, if not totally, inſenſible.</p>
            <p>If we then inquire for the character of this emotion, it muſt be where the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected object or event produceth leſs violent effects. And while the mind remains ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of pleaſure and pain, is it not natural to ſuppoſe, that ſurpriſe, like wonder, ſhould have an invariable character? I am incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned however to think, that ſurpriſe has no invariable character, but aſſumes that of the object which raiſes it. Wonder is the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of a natural principle, and upon
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0258100201:341"/>
that account muſt be pleaſant. There, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty is the capital circumſtance, which, for a time, is intitled to poſſeſs the mind entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one unvaried tone. The unexpected appearance of an object, ſeems not equally intitled to produce an emotion diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from the emotion, pleaſant or painful, that is produced by the object in its ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appearance. It ought not naturally to have any effect, other than to ſwell that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, by making it more pleaſant or more painful than it commonly is. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture is confirmed by experience, as well as by language, which is built upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. When a man meets a friend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, he is ſaid to be agreeably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed; and when he meets an enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, he is ſaid to be diſagreeably ſurpriſed. It appears then, that the ſole ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſurpriſe is to ſwell the emotion raiſed by the object. And this effect can be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained. A tide of connected percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, glides gently into the mind, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth no perturbation. An object on the other hand breaking in unexpectedly, ſounds an alarm, rouſes the mind out of its calm
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0258100201:342"/>
ſtate, and directs its whole attention upon the object, which, if agreeable, becomes doubly ſo. Several circumſtances concur to produce this effect. On the one hand, the agitation of the mind and its keen atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prepare it in the moſt effectual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for receiving a deep impreſſion. On the other hand, the object by its ſudden and unforeſeen appearance, makes an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, not gradually as expected objects do, but as at one ſtroke with its whole force. The circumſtances are preciſely ſimilar, where the object is in itſelf diſagreeable.</p>
            <p>The pleaſure of novelty is eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that of variety. To produce the latter, a plurality of objects is neceſſary. The former ariſes from a circumſtance found in a ſingle object. Again, where objects, whether coexiſtent or in ſucceſſion, are ſufficiently diverſified, the pleaſure of variety is complete, though every ſingle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the train be familiar. But the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of novelty, directly oppoſite to familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, requires no diverſification.</p>
            <p>There are different degrees of novelty, and its effects are in proportion. The low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0258100201:343"/>
degree is found in objects that are ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſecond time after a long interval. That in this caſe an object takes on ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of novelty, is certain from experience. A large building of many parts variouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned, or an extenſive field embelliſhed with trees, lakes, temples, ſtatues, and other ornaments, will appear new oftener than once. The memory of an object ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex is ſoon loſt; of its parts at leaſt, or of their arrangement. But experience teaches, that even without any decay of remembrance, abſence alone will give an air of novelty to a once familiar object; which is not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, becauſe familiarity wears off gradually by abſence. Thus a perſon with whom we have been intimate, returning after a long interval, appears like a new acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Diſtance of place contributes to this appearance, not leſs than diſtance of time. A friend after a ſhort abſence in a remote country, has the ſame air of novelty as if he had returned after a longer interval from a place nearer home. The mind forms a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection betwixt him and the remote coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and beſtows upon him the ſingularity
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0258100201:344"/>
of the objects he has ſeen. When two things equally new and ſingular are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſpectator balances betwixt them. But when told that one of them is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a diſtant quarter of the world, he no longer heſitates, but clings to this as the more ſingular. Hence the preference gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to foreign luxuries and to foreign curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, which appear rare in proportion to their original diſtance.</p>
            <p>The next degree of novelty, mounting upward, is found in objects of which we have ſome information at ſecond hand. For deſcription, though it contribute to familiarity, cannot altogether remove the appearance of novelty when the object itſelf is preſented. The firſt ſight of a lion oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſome wonder, after a thorough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the correcteſt pictures or ſtatues of that animal.</p>
            <p>A new object that bears ſome diſtant reſemblance to a known ſpecies, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a third degree of novelty. A ſtrong reſemblance among individuals of the ſame ſpecies, prevents almoſt entirely the effect of novelty; unleſs diſtance of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0258100201:345"/>
place or ſome other circumſtance concur. But where the reſemblance is faint, ſome degree of wonder is felt; and the emotion riſes in proportion to the faintneſs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance.</p>
            <p>The higheſt degree of wonder ariſeth from unknown objects that have no ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to any ſpecies we are acquainted with. Shakeſpear in a ſimile introduces this ſpecies of novelty.<q>
                  <l>As glorious to the ſight</l>
                  <l>As is a winged meſſenger from heaven</l>
                  <l>Unto the white upturned wondring eye</l>
                  <l>Of mortals, that fall back to gaze on him</l>
                  <l>When he beſtrides the lazy-pacing clouds,</l>
                  <l>And ſails upon the boſom of the air.</l>
                  <bibl>Romeo and Juliet.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>One example of this ſpecies of novelty deſerves peculiar attention; and that is, when an object altogether new is ſeen by one perſon only, and but for once. Theſe circumſtances heighten remarkably the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. The ſingularity of the condition of the ſpectator concurs with the ſingularity
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0258100201:346"/>
of the object, to inflame wonder to its higheſt pitch.</p>
            <p>In explaining the effects of novelty, the place a being occupies in the ſcale of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is a circumſtance that muſt not be omitted. Novelty in the individuals of a low claſs, is perceived with indifference, or with a very ſlight emotion. Thus a pebble, however ſingular in its appearance, ſcarce moves our wonder. The emotion riſes with the rank of the object; and, other circumſtances being equal, is ſtrongeſt in the higheſt order of exiſtence. A ſtrange animal affects us more than a ſtrange vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and were we admitted to view ſuperior beings, our wonder would riſe proportionably; and accompanying Nature in her amazing works, be completed in the contemplation of the Deity.</p>
            <p>However natural the love of novelty may be, it is a matter of experience, that thoſe who reliſh novelty the moſt, are careful to conceal its influence. This reliſh, it is true, prevails in children, in idle people, and in men of a weak mind. And yet, after all, why ſhould one be aſhamed for indulging
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0258100201:347"/>
a natural propenſity? A diſtinction will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this difficulty. No man is aſhamed to own, that he loves to contemplate new or ſtrange objects. He neither condemns himſelf nor is cenſured by others, for this appetite. But every man ſtudies to conceal, that he loves a thing or performs an action, merely for its novelty. The reaſon of the difference will ſet the matter in a clear light. Curioſity is a natural principle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected upon new and ſingular objects, in the contemplation of which its gratification conſiſts, without leading to any end other than knowledge. The man therefore who prefers any thing merely becauſe it is new, hath not this principle for his juſtification; nor indeed any good principle. Vanity is at the bottom, which eaſily prevails upon thoſe who have no taſte, to prefer things odd, rare, or ſingular, in order to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves from others. And in fact, the appetite for novelty, as above mentioned, reigns chiefly among perſons of a mean taſte, who are ignorant of refined and elegant pleaſures.</p>
            <p>The gratification of curioſity, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0258100201:348"/>
above, is diſtinguiſhed by a proper name, <hi>viz. wonder</hi>; an honour denied to the gratification of any other principle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, or paſſion, ſo far as I can recollect. This ſingularity indicates ſome important final cauſe, which I endeavour to unfold. An acquaintance with the various things that may affect us, and with their properties, is eſſential to our well-being. Nor will a ſlight or ſuperficial acquaintance be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. It ought to be ſo deeply ingraved on the mind, as to be ready for uſe upon every occaſion. Now, in order to a deep impreſſion, it is wiſely contrived, that things ſhould be introduced to our acquaintance, with a certain pomp and ſolemnity produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a vivid emotion. When the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is once fairly made, the emotion of novelty, being no longer neceſſary, vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth almoſt inſtantaneouſly; never to return, unleſs where the impreſſion happens to be obliterated by length of time or other means; in which caſe the ſecond introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is nearly as ſolemn as the firſt.</p>
            <p>Deſigning wiſdom is no where more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible than in this part of the human frame.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0258100201:349"/>
If new objects did not affect us in a very peculiar manner, their impreſſions would be ſo ſlight as ſcarce to be of any uſe in life. On the other hand, did objects continue to affect us as deeply as at firſt, the mind would be totally ingroſſed with them, and have no room left either for action or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
            <p>The final cauſe of ſurpriſe is ſtill more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident than of novelty. Self-love makes us vigilantly attentive to ſelf-preſervation. But ſelf-love, which operates by means of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and reflection, and impells not the mind to any particular object or from it, is a principle too cool for a ſudden emergency. An object breaking in unexpectedly, affords no time for deliberation; and, in this caſe, the agitation of ſurpriſe is artfully contrived to rouſe ſelf-love into action. Surpriſe gives the alarm, and if there be any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of danger, our whole force is inſtantly ſummoned up to ſhun or to prevent it.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. Riſible Objects.</head>
            <p>SUCH is the nature of man, that his powers and faculties are ſoon blunted by exerciſe. The returns of ſleep, ſuſpending all activity, are not alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preſerve him in vigor. During his waking hours, amuſement by intervals is requiſite to unbend his mind from ſerious occupation. The imagination, of all our faculties the moſt active, and not always at reſt even in ſleep, contributes more than any other cauſe to recruit the mind and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore its vigor, by amuſing us with gay and ludicrous images; and when relaxation is neceſſary, ſuch amuſement is much reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But there are other ſources of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beſide the imagination. Many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, natural as well as artificial, may be diſtinguiſhed by the epithet of <hi>riſible,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they raiſe in us a peculiar emotion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0258100201:351"/>
externally by <hi>laughter.</hi> This is a pleaſant emotion; and being alſo mirthful, it moſt ſucceſsfully unbends the mind and recruits the ſpirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ludicrous</hi> is a general term, ſignifying, as we may conjecture from its derivation, what is playſome, ſportive, or jocular. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous</hi> therefore ſeems the genus, of which <hi>riſible</hi> is a ſpecies, limited as above to what makes us laugh.</p>
            <p>However eaſy it may be, concerning any particular object, to ſay whether it be riſible or not; it ſeems difficult, if at all practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, to eſtabliſh beforehand any general character by which objects of this kind may be diſtinguiſhed from others. Nor is this a ſingular caſe. Upon a review, we find the ſame difficulty in moſt of the articles already handled. There is nothing more eaſy, viewing a particular object, than to pronounce that it is beautiful or ugly, grand or little: but were we to attempt general rules for ranging objects under different claſſes, according to theſe qualities, we ſhould find ourſelves utterly at a loſs. There is a ſeparate cauſe which increaſes the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0258100201:352"/>
of diſtinguiſhing riſible objects by a general character. All men are not equally affected by riſible objects; and even the ſame perſon is more diſpoſed to laugh at one time than another. In high ſpirits a thing will make us laugh outright, that will ſcarce provoke a ſmile when we are in a grave mood. We muſt therefore abandon the thought of attempting general rules for diſtinguiſhing riſible objects from others. Riſible objects however are circumſcribed within certain limits, which I ſhall ſuggeſt, without pretending to any degree of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. And, in the firſt place, I obſerve, that no object is riſible but what appears ſlight, little, or trifling. For man is ſo conſtituted as to be ſeriouſly affected with every thing that is of importance to his own intereſt or to that of others. Secondly, with reſpect to the works both of nature and of art, nothing is riſible but what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viates from the common nature of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: it muſt be ſome particular out of rule, ſome remarkable defect or exceſs, a very long viſage, for example, or a very ſhort one. Hence nothing juſt, proper, decent,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0258100201:353"/>
beautiful, proportioned, or grand, is riſible. A real diſtreſs raiſes pity, and therefore cannot be riſible. But a ſlight or imaginary diſtreſs, which moves not pity, is riſible. The adventure of the fulling-mills in Don Quixote is extremely riſible; ſo is the ſcene where Sancho, in a dark night, tumbles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pit, and attaches himſelf to the ſide by hand and foot, there hanging in terrible diſmay till the morning, when he diſcovers himſelf to be within a foot of the bottom. A noſe remarkably long or ſhort is riſible; but to want the noſe altogether, far from provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king laughter, raiſes horror in the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>From what is ſaid, it will readily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that the emotion raiſed by a riſible object is of a nature ſo ſingular as ſcarce to find place while the mind is occupied with any other paſſion or emotion. And this conjecture is verified by experience. We ſcarce ever find this emotion blended with any other. One emotion I muſt except, and that is contempt raiſed by ſome ſort of improprieties. Every improper act inſpires us with ſome degree of contempt for the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0258100201:354"/>
author. And if an improper act be at the ſame time riſible and provoke laughter, of which blunders and abſurdities are noted inſtances, the two emotions of contempt and of laughter unite intimately in the mind, and produce externally what is termed <hi>a laugh of deriſion</hi> or <hi>of ſcorn.</hi> Hence objects that cauſe laughter, may be diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two kinds. They are either <hi>riſible</hi> or <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</hi> A riſible object is mirthful only; a ridiculous object is both mirthful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. The firſt raiſes an emotion of laughter that is altogether pleaſant: the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of laughter raiſed by the other, is qualified with that of contempt; and the mixed emotion, partly pleaſant partly pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is termed <hi>the emotion of ridicule.</hi> I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge myſelf of the pain a ridiculous object gives me by a laugh of deriſion. A riſible object, on the other hand, gives me no pain: it is altogether pleaſant by a certain ſort of titillation, which is expreſſed externally by mirthful laughter. Ridicule will be more fully explained afterward: the preſent chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is appropriated to the other emotion.</p>
            <p>Riſible objects are ſo common and ſo well

underſtood, that it is unneceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume paper or time upon them. Take the few following examples.</p>

I quak'd for fear, leſt the lunatic knave would have ſearch'd it; but Fate, ordaining he ſhould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a ſearch, and away went I for foul cloaths. But mark the ſequel, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Brook.

            <p>HAVING diſcuſſed thoſe qualities and circumſtances of ſingle objects that ſeem peculiarly connected with cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, we proceed, according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod propoſed in the chapter of beauty, to the relations of objects, beginning with the relations of reſemblance and contraſt.</p>
            <p>Man being unavoidably connected with the beings around him, ſome acquaintance with their nature, their powers, and their qualities, is requiſite for regulating his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. As an incentive to acquire a branch of knowledge ſo eſſential to our well-being, motives alone of reaſon and intereſt are not ſufficient. Nature hath providently ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added curioſity, a vigorous propenſity which never is at reſt. It is this propenſity which attaches us to every new object<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 6.</note>; and in
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0258100201:359"/>
particular incites us to conſider objects in the way of compariſon, in order to diſcover their differences and reſemblances.</p>
            <p>Reſemblance among objects of the ſame kind, and diſſimilitude among objects of different kinds, are too obvious and familiar to gratify our curioſity in any degree. The gratification lies in diſcovering differences among things where reſemblance prevails, and in diſcovering reſemblances where dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference prevails. Thus a difference in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of the ſame kind of plants or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals is deemed a diſcovery, while the many particulars in which they agree are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and in different kinds, any reſemblance is greedily remarked, without attending to the many particulars in which they differ.</p>
            <p>A compariſon however may be too far ſtretched. When differences or reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are carried beyond certain bounds, they appear ſlight and trivial; and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will not be reliſhed by one of taſte. Yet ſuch propenſity is there to gratify paſſion, curioſity in particular, that even among good writers, we find many compariſons too ſlight to afford ſatisfaction. Hence the frequent
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0258100201:360"/>
inſtances among logicians, of diſtinctions without any ſolid difference: and hence the frequent inſtances among poets and orators, of ſimiles without any juſt reſemblance. With regard to the latter, I ſhall confine myſelf to one inſtance, which will probably amuſe the reader, being a citation not from a poet nor orator, but from a grave author writing an inſtitute of law. <q rend="inline">"Our ſtudent ſhall obſerve, that the knowledge of the law is like a deep well, out of which each man draweth according to the ſtrength of his underſtanding. He that reacheth deepeſt, ſeeth the amiable and admirable ſecrets of the law, wherein I aſſure you the ſages of the law in former times have had the deepeſt reach. And as the bucket in the depth is eaſily drawn to the uppermoſt part of the water, (for <hi>nullum elementum in ſuo proprio loco eſt grave</hi>), but take it from the water it cannot be drawn up but with a great difficulty; ſo, albeit beginnings of this ſtudy ſeem difficult, yet when the profeſſor of the law can dive into the depth, it is delightful, eaſy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

There is a river in Macedon, there is alſo more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a river in Monmouth: it is call'd <hi>Wye</hi> at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river; but it is all one, 'tis as like as my fingers to my fingers, and there is ſalmons in both. If you mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life is come after it indifferent well; for there is figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his diſpleaſures, and his indignations, and alſo being a little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you, kill his peſt friend Clytus.</p>

            <p>Inſtruction, no doubt, is the chief end of compariſon, but not the only end. In works addreſſed to the imagination, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon may be employed with great ſucceſs to put a ſubject in a ſtrong point of view. A lively idea is formed of a man's courage, by likening it to that of a lion; and eloquence is exalted in our imagination, by comparing it to a river overflowing its banks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving all in its impetuous courſe. The ſame effect is produced by contraſt. A man in proſperity, becomes more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0258100201:363"/>
of his happineſs, by oppoſing his condition to that of a perſon in want of bread. Thus compariſon is ſubſervient to poetry as well as to philoſophy; and with reſpect to both, the foregoing obſervation holds equally, that reſemblance among ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the ſame kind, and contraſt among objects of different kinds, have no effect. Such a compariſon neither tends to gratify our curioſity, nor to ſet the objects compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a ſtronger light. Two apartments in a palace, ſimilar in ſhape, ſize, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, make ſeparately as good a figure as when compared; and the ſame obſervation applies to two ſimilar copartments in a garden. On the other hand, oppoſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular building to a fall of water, or a good picture to a towering hill, or even a little dog to a large horſe, and the contraſt will produce no effect. But reſemblance, where the objects compared are of different kinds, and contraſt where the objects compared are of the ſame kind, have each of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably an enlivening effect. The poets, ſuch of them as have a juſt taſte, draw all their ſimiles from things that in the main
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0258100201:364"/>
differ widely from the principal ſubject; and they never attempt a contraſt but where the things have a common genus and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance in the capital circumſtances. Place together a large and a ſmall ſized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal of the ſame ſpecies, the one will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear greater the other leſs, than when view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeparately. When we oppoſe beauty to deformity, each makes a greater figure by the compariſon.</p>
            <p>Upon a ſubject not only in itſelf curious, but of great importance in all the fine arts, I muſt be more particular. That reſemblance and contraſt have an enlivening effect upon objects of ſight, is made ſufficiently evident; and that they have the ſame effect upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the other ſenſes, will appear from induction. Nor is this law confined to the external ſenſes. Characters contraſted, make a greater figure by the oppoſition. Iago, in the tragedy of <hi>Othello,</hi> ſays

Paſſions and emotions are alſo inflamed by compariſon. A man of high rank humbles the byſtanders ſo far as almoſt to annihilate them in their own opinion. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, beholding the ſtatue of Alexander, felt a great depreſſion of ſpirits, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, that now at the age of thirty-two, when Alexander died, he had not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one memorable action.</p>
            <p>Our opinions alſo are much influenced by compariſon. A man whoſe opulence exceeds the ordinary ſtandard, is reputed richer than he is in reality; and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of wiſdom or weakneſs, if at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0258100201:367"/>
is generally carried beyond the truth.</p>
            <p>The opinion a man forms of his preſent condition as to happineſs or miſery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in a great meaſure on the compariſon he makes betwixt it and his former condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

The diſtreſs of a long journey makes even an indifferent inn paſs current. And in travelling, when the road is good and the horſeman well covered, a bad day may be agreeable, by making him ſenſible how ſnug he is.</p>
            <p>The ſame effect is equally remarkable, when a man ſets his condition in oppoſition to that of others. A ſhip toſſed about in a ſtorm, makes the ſpectator reflect upon his own ſecurity and eaſe, and puts theſe in the ſtrongeſt light:

The appearance of danger gives ſometimes pleaſure, ſometimes pain. A timorous perſon upon the battlements of a high tower, is ſeized with terror, which even the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of ſecurity cannot diſſipate. But upon one of a firm head, this ſituation has a contrary effect. The appearance of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger heightens by oppoſition the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſecurity, and of conſequence the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that ariſes from ſecurity. The feeling here reſembles that above mentioned occaſioned by a ſhip labouring in a ſtorm.</p>
            <p>This effect of magnifying or leſſening ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by means of compariſon, is ſo familiar, that no philoſopher has thought of ſearching for a cauſe<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Practical writers upon the fine arts will attempt any thing, being blind both to the difficulty and danger. De Piles, accounti g why contraſt is agreeable, ſays, <q rend="inline">"That it is a ſort of war which puts the oppoſite parties in motion."</q> Thus, to account for an effect of which there is no doubt, any cauſe, however fooliſh, is made welcome.</p>
               </note>. The obſcurity of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may poſſibly have contributed to their ſilence. But luckily in treating other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, a principle is unfolded which will clearly account for this phenomenon. It
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0258100201:371"/>
depends upon the power of paſſion to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del our opinion of objects for its gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 2. part 5.</note>. We have had occaſion to ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny illuſtrious examples of this ſingular power of paſſion; and the preſent ſubject affords an additional inſtance. That this is the cauſe, will evidently appear, by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what manner a ſpectator is affected, when a very large animal is for the firſt time placed beſide a very ſmall one of the ſame ſpecies. The oppoſition is the firſt thing that ſtrikes the mind: the unuſual appearance gives ſurpriſe; and the ſpectator, prone to gratify this emotion, conceives the oppoſition to be the greateſt that can be. He ſees, or ſeems to ſee, the one animal extremely little, and the other extremely large. The emotion of ſurpriſe ariſing from any unuſual reſemblance, ſerves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to explain why at firſt view we are apt to think ſuch reſemblance more entire than it is in reality. And it muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the circumſtances of more and leſs, which are the proper ſubjects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0258100201:372"/>
raiſe a perception ſo indiſtinct and vague as to facilitate the effect deſcribed. We have no mental ſtandard of great and little, nor of the ſeveral degrees of any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute; and the mind thus unreſtrained, is naturally diſpoſed to indulge its ſurpriſe to the utmoſt extent.</p>
            <p>In exploring the operations of the mind, ſome of which are extremely nice and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, it is neceſſary to proceed with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt circumſpection. And after all, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it happens that ſpeculations of this kind afford any ſtrong conviction. Luckily, in the preſent caſe, we have at hand facts and experiments that ſupport the foregoing theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a ſatisfactory manner. In the firſt place, the oppoſing a ſmall object of one ſpecies to a great object of another, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not, in any degree, that effect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt, which is ſo remarkable when both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are of the ſame ſpecies. There is no difference betwixt theſe two caſes that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to have any influence, but only that the former is common, the latter rare. May we not then fairly conclude, that ſurpriſe from the rarity of appearance is the cauſe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0258100201:373"/>
of contraſt, when we find no ſuch effect where the appearance is common? In the next place, if ſurpriſe be the ſole cauſe of the effects that appear in making a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, it follows neceſſarily that theſe effects will vaniſh ſo ſoon as a compariſon becomes familiar. This holds ſo unerringly, as to leave no reaſonable doubt that ſurpriſe is the prime mover in this operation. Our ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe is great the firſt time a ſmall lapdog is ſeen with a large maſtiff: but when two ſuch animals are conſtantly together, there is no ſurpriſe; and it makes no difference whether they be viewed ſeparately or in company. We put no bounds to the riches of a man who has recently made his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The oppoſition betwixt his preſent and paſt ſituation, or betwixt his preſent ſituation and that of others, is carried to an extreme. With regard to a family that for many generations hath enjoyed great wealth, the ſame falſe reckoning is not made. It is equally remarkable, that a ſimile loſes its effect by repetition. A lover compared to a moth ſcorching itſelf at the flame of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, is a ſprightly ſimile, which by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0258100201:374"/>
uſe has loſt all force. Love cannot now be compared to fire, without ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of diſguſt. It has been juſtly objected againſt Homer, that the lion is too often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in his ſimiles. All the variety he is able to throw into them, is not ſufficient to keep alive the reader's ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p>To explain the influence of compariſon upon the mind, I have choſen the ſimpleſt caſe, that of two animals of the ſame kind, differing in ſize only, ſeen for the firſt time. To complete the theory, other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt be taken in. And the next ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I ſhall make, is where both animals, ſeparately familiar to the ſpectator, are brought together for the firſt time. In this caſe, the effect of magnifying and diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will be found remarkably greater than in that firſt mentioned. And the reaſon will appear upon analyzing the operation. The firſt thing we feel is ſurpriſe, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the uncommon difference of two creatures of the ſame ſpecies. We are next ſenſible, that the one appears leſs, the other larger, than they did formerly. This new circumſtance is a ſecond cauſe of ſurpriſe,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0258100201:375"/>
and augments it ſo as to make us imagine a ſtill greater oppoſition betwixt the animals, than if we had formed no notion of them beforehand.</p>
            <p>I ſhall confine myſelf to one other ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, That the ſpectator was acquainted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with one of the animals only, the lapdog for example. This new circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance will vary the effect. Inſtead of widening the natural difference by enlarging in appearance the one animal and diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other in proportion, the whole ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent alteration will reſt upon the lapdog. The ſurpriſe to find it leſs than judged to be formerly, will draw the whole attention of the mind upon it; and this ſurpriſe will be gratified, by conceiving it to be of the moſt diminutive ſize poſſible. The maſtiff in the mean time is quite neglected. I am able to illuſtrate this effect by a very familiar exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Take a piece of paper or linen rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to be a good white, and compare it with ſomething of the ſame kind that is a pure white. The judgement we formed of the firſt object is inſtantly varied; and the ſurpriſe occaſioned by finding it not ſo
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0258100201:376"/>
white as was thought, produceth a haſty conviction that it is much leſs white than it is in reality. Withdrawing now the pure white, and putting in its place a deep black, the ſurpriſe occaſioned by this new circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance carries our thought to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, and we now conceive the original ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be a pure white. Thus experience forces us to acknowledge, that our emotions have an influence even upon our eye-ſight. This experiment leads to a general obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That whatever is found more ſtrange or beautiful than was expected, is judged to be more ſtrange or beautiful than it is in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Hence it is a common artifice, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate beforehand what we wiſh to make a figure in the eyes of others.</p>
            <p>The compariſons employed by poets and orators, coincide with the laſt-mentioned ſuppoſition. It is always a known object that is to be aggrandized or leſſened. The former is effectuated by likening it to ſome grand object, or by contraſting it with one that has the oppoſite character. To effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the latter, the method muſt be rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The object muſt be contraſted with
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0258100201:377"/>
ſomething ſuperior to itſelf, or likened to ſomething inferior. The whole effect is produced upon the principal ſubject, which by this means is elevated above its rank or depreſſed below it.</p>
            <p>In accounting for the effect that any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual reſemblance or contraſt has upon the mind, I have hitherto aſſigned no other cauſe but ſurpriſe; and to prevent confuſion and obſcurity, I thought it proper to diſcuſs that principle firſt. But ſurpriſe is not the only cauſe of the effect deſcribed. Another cauſe concurs, which operates perhaps not leſs powerfully than ſurpriſe. This cauſe is a principle in human nature that lies ſtill in obſcurity, not having been evolved by any writer, though its effects are extenſive. As it is not diſtinguiſhed by a proper name, the reader muſt be ſatisfied with the following deſcription. No man who ſtudies himſelf or others but muſt be ſenſible of a tendency or propenſity in the mind to complete every work that is begun, and to carry things to their full perfection. This principle has lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle opportunity to diſplay itſelf upon natural operations, which are ſeldom left imperfect.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0258100201:378"/>
But in the operations of art it hath great ſcope; and diſplays itſelf remarkably, by making us perſevere in our own work, and by making us wiſh for the completion of what is done by another. We feel a ſenſible pleaſure when the work is brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and our pain is not leſs ſenſible when we are diſappointed. Hence our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, when an intereſting ſtory is broke off in the middle, when a piece of muſic ends without a cloſe, or when a building or garden is left imperfect. The ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple operates in making collections, ſuch as the whole works good and bad of any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. A certain perſon endeavoured to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect prints of all the capital paintings, and ſucceeded except as to a few. La Bruyere remarks, that an anxious ſearch was made for theſe, not on account of their value, but to complete the ſet<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The examples above given are of ſubjects that can be brought to an end or concluſion. But the ſame uneaſineſs is perceptible with reſpect to ſubjects that admit not any conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; witneſs a ſeries that has no end, commonly called <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſeries.</hi> The mind running along ſuch a ſeries, begins ſoon to feel an uneaſineſs, which becomes more and more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in continuing its progreſs.</p>
                  <p>An unbounded proſpect doth not long continue agreeable. We ſoon feel a ſlight uneaſineſs, which increaſes with the time we beſtow upon the object. In order to find the cauſe of this uneaſineſs, we firſt take under conſideration an avenue without a terminating object. Can a proſpect without any ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination be compared to an infinite ſeries? There is one ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king difference, that with reſpect to the eye no proſpect can be unbounded. The quickeſt eye commands but a certain length of ſpace; and there it is bounded, however obſcurely. But the mind perceives things as they exiſt; and the line is carried on in idea without end. In that reſpect an unbounded proſpect is ſimilar to an infinite ſeries. In fact, the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an unbounded proſpect differs very little in its feeling from that of an infinite ſeries; and therefore we may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably conclude that both proceed from the ſame cauſe.</p>
                  <p>We next conſider a proſpect unbounded every way, as for example, a great plain, or the ocean, viewed from an eminence. We feel here an uneaſineſs occaſioned by the want of an end or termination, preciſely as in the other caſes. A proſpect unbounded every way is indeed ſo far ſingular, as at firſt to be more pleaſant than a proſpect that is unbounded in one direction only, and afterward to be more painful. But theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are eaſily explained without breaking in upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral theory. The pleaſure we feel at firſt is a ſtrong emotion of grandeur, ariſing from the immenſe extenſion of the object. And to increaſe the pain we feel afterward for the want of a termination, there concurs a pain of a different kind, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſtretching the eye to comprehend ſo great a proſpect; a pain that gradually increaſes with the repeated efforts we make to graſp the whole.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſame principle, if I miſtake not, which operates imperceptibly with reſpect to quantity and number. Another's property indented into my field gives me uneaſineſs; and I am eager to make the purchaſe, not for profit, but in order to ſquare my field. Xerxes and his army in their paſſage to Greece were ſumptuouſly entertained by Pythius the Lydian. Xerxes get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a particular account of his riches, recompenſed him with 7000 Darics, which he wanted to complete the ſum of four millions.</p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0258100201:379"/>
The final cauſe of this principle is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional proof of its exiſtence. Human works are of no ſignificancy till they be completed. Reaſon is not always a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient counterbalance to indolence: and ſome principle over and above is neceſſary, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our induſtry, and to prevent our ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſhort in the middle of the courſe.</p>
            <p>We need not loſe time in deſcribing the co-operation of the foregoing principle with
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0258100201:380"/>
ſurpriſe in producing the effect that is felt upon the appearance of any unuſual reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or contraſt. Surpriſe firſt operates, and carries our opinion of the reſemblance or contraſt beyond the truth. The principle we have been deſcribing carries us ſtill farther; for being bent upon gratification, it forces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mind a conviction that the reſemblance or contraſt is complete. We need no better illuſtration than the reſemblance that is fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0258100201:381"/>
in ſome pebbles to a tree or an inſect. The reſemblance, however faint in reality, is conceived to be wonderfully perfect. This tendency to complete a reſemblance acting jointly with ſurpriſe, carries the mind ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo far as even to preſume upon future events. In the Greek tragedy, intitled, <hi>Phineides,</hi> thoſe unhappy women, ſeeing the place where it was intended they ſhould be ſlain, cried out with anguiſh, <q rend="inline">"They now ſaw their cruel deſtiny had condemned them to die in that place, being the ſame where they had been expoſed in their infancy<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtotle, poet. cap. 17.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This remarkable principle which inclines us to advance every thing to its perfection, not only co-operates with ſurpriſe to deceive the mind, but of itſelf is able to produce that effect. Of this we ſee many inſtances where there is no place for ſurpriſe. The firſt inſtance I ſhall give is of reſemblance. <hi>Unumquodque eodem modo diſſolvitur quo colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum eſt,</hi> is a maxim in the Roman law that has no foundation in truth. For tying and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0258100201:382"/>
looſing, building and demoliſhing, are acts oppoſite to each other, and are performed by oppoſite means. But when theſe acts are connected by their relation to the ſame ſubject, their connection leads us to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a ſort of reſemblance betwixt them, which the foregoing principle makes us conceive to be as complete as poſſible. The next inſtance ſhall be of contraſt. Addiſon obſerves<note n="*" place="bottom">Spectator, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 265.</note>, <q rend="inline">"That the paleſt features look the moſt agreeable in white; that a face which is overfluſhed appears to advantage in the deepeſt ſcarlet; and that a dark complexion is not a little alleviated by a black hood."</q> The foregoing principle ſerves to account for theſe appearances. To make this evident, one of the caſes ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. A complexion, however dark, never approaches to black. When theſe colours appear together, their oppoſition ſtrikes us; and the propenſity we have to complete the oppoſition, makes the darkneſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion vaniſh out of ſight.</p>
            <p>The operation of this principle, even
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0258100201:383"/>
where there is no ground for ſurpriſe, is not confined to opinion or conviction. So powerful is it, as to make us ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to action in order to complete a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance or contraſt. If this appear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, it will be made clear by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtances. Upon what principle is the <hi>lex talionis</hi> founded other than to make the puniſhment reſemble the miſchief? Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dictates, that there ought to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity or reſemblance betwixt a crime and its puniſhment; and the foregoing principle impells us to make the reſemblance as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete as poſſible. Titus Livius, influenced by this principle, accounts for a certain puniſhment by a reſemblance betwixt it and the crime, far too ſubtile for common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. Speaking of Mettus Fuffetius, the Alban general, who, for treachery to the Romans, his allies, was ſentenced to be torn to pieces by horſes, he puts the following ſpeech in the mouth of Tullus Hoſtilius, who decreed the puniſhment. <q rend="inline">"Mette Fuffeti, inquit, ſi ipſe diſcere poſſes fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ac foedera ſervare, vivo tibi ea diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plina a me adhibita eſſet. Nunc, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam

tuum inſanabile ingenium eſt, at tu tuo ſupplicio doce humanum genus, ea ſancta credere, quae a te violata ſunt. Ut igitur paulo ante animum inter Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natem Romanamque rem ancipitem geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſti, ita jam corpus paſſim diſtrahendum dabis<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 1. § 28.</note>."</q> By the ſame influence, the ſentence is often executed upon the very ſpot where the crime was committed. In the <hi>Electra</hi> of Sophocles, Egiſtheus is drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the theatre into an inner room of the ſuppoſed palace, to ſuffer death where he murdered Agamemnon. Shakeſpear, whoſe knowledge of nature is not leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found than extenſive, has not overlooked this propenſity:

            <p>Upon the ſubject in general, I have two remarks to add. The firſt concerns reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, which when too entire hath no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, however different in kind the things compared may be. This remark is applicable to works of art only; for natural objects of different kinds, have ſcarce ever an entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance. Marble is a ſort of matter, very different from what compoſes an animal; and marble cut into a human figure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces great pleaſure by the reſemblance. But let a marble ſtatue be coloured like a
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0258100201:386"/>
picture, the reſemblance is ſo entire as to produce no effect. At a diſtance, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a real perſon. We diſcover the miſtake when we approach; and no other emotion is raiſed but ſurpriſe occaſioned by the deception. The idea of reſemblance is ſunk into that of identity. The figure ſtill appears to our eyes rather to be a real perſon than a reſemblance of it; and we muſt make uſe of our reflection to correct the miſtake. This cannot happen in a picture; for the reſemblance can never be ſo entire as to diſguiſe the imitation.</p>
            <p>The other remark regards contraſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions make the greateſt figure when contraſted in ſucceſſion. But then the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ought neither to be precipitate nor immoderately ſlow. If too ſlow, the effect of contraſt becomes faint by the diſtance of the emotions; and if precipitate, no ſingle emotion has room to expand itſelf to its full ſize; but is ſtifled as it were in the birth by a ſucceeding emotion. The funeral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Biſhop of Meaux upon the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of Orleans, is a perfect hotchpotch of chearful and melancholy repreſentations
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0258100201:387"/>
following each other in the quickeſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Oppoſite emotions are beſt felt in ſucceſſion: but each emotion ſeparately ſhould be raiſed to its due pitch, before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other be introduced.</p>
            <p>What is above laid down, will enable us to determine a very important queſtion concerning emotions raiſed by the fine arts, <hi>viz.</hi> What ought to be the rule of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; whether ought reſemblance to be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died or contraſt? The emotions raiſed by the fine arts, are generally too nearly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make a figure by reſemblance; and for that reaſon, their ſucceſſion ought to be regulated as much as poſſible by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt. This holds confeſſedly in epic and dramatic compoſitions: and the beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, led perhaps by a good taſte more than by reaſoning, have generally aimed at this beauty. In the ſame cantata, all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of emotions that are within the power of muſic, may not only be indulged, but, to make the greateſt figure, ought to be contraſted. In gardening there is an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reaſon for the rule. The emotions raiſed by that art, are at beſt ſo faint, that
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0258100201:388"/>
every artifice ſhould be uſed to give them their utmoſt ſtrength. A field may be laid out in grand, ſweet, gay, neat, wild, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſcenes. When theſe are viewed in ſucceſſion, grandeur ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted with neatneſs, regularity with wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and gaiety with melancholy; ſo as that each emotion may ſucceed its oppoſite. Nay it is an improvement to intermix in the ſucceſſion, rude uncultivated ſpots as well as unbounded views, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are diſagreeable, but in ſucceſſion heighten the feeling of the agreeable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And we have nature for our guide, who in her moſt beautiful landſcapes often intermixes rugged rocks, dirty marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and barren ſtony heaths. The greateſt maſters of muſic, have the ſame view in their compoſitions: the ſecond part of an Italian ſong ſeldom conveys any ſentiment; and, by its harſhneſs, ſeems purpoſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to give a greater reliſh for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting parts of the compoſition.</p>
            <p>A ſmall garden comprehended under a ſingle view, affords little opportunity for this embelliſhment. Diſſimilar emotions
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0258100201:389"/>
require different tones of mind; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in conjunction can never make a good figure<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 2. part 4.</note>. Gaiety and ſweetneſs may be combined, or wildneſs and gloomineſs; but a compoſition of gaiety and gloomineſs is diſtaſteful. The rude uncultivated copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of furze and broom in Richmond garden, hath a good effect in the ſucceſſion of objects; but a ſpot of this nature would be inſufferable in the midſt of a poliſhed parterre or flower-plot. A garden there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if not of great extent, will not admit of diſſimilar emotions. And in ornamenting a ſmall garden, the ſafeſt courſe is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it to a ſingle expreſſion. For the ſame reaſon, a landſcape ought alſo to be confined to a ſingle expreſſion. It is accordingly a rule in painting, That if the ſubject be gay, every figure ought to contribute to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</p>
            <p>It follows from the foregoing train of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, that a garden near a great city, ought to have an air of ſolitude. The ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſs again of a waſte country ought to

be contraſted in forming a garden; no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, no obſcure walks; but <hi>jets d'eau,</hi> caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades, objects active, gay, and ſplendid. Nay ſuch a garden ſhould in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure avoid imitating nature, by taking on an extraordinary appearance of regularity and art, to ſhow the buſy hand of man, which in a waſte country has a fine effect by contraſt.</p>
            <p>It may be gathered from what is ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 2. part 4.</note>, that wit and ridicule make not an agreeable mixture with grandeur. Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar emotions have a fine effect in a ſlow ſucceſſion; but in a rapid ſucceſſion, which approaches to co-exiſtence, they will not be reliſhed. In the midſt of a laboured and elevated deſcription of a battle, Virgil introduces a ludicrous image, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly out of its place:
<q>
                  <l>Obvius ambuſtum torrem Chorinaeus ab ara</l>
                  <l>Corripit, et venienti Ebuſo plagamque ferenti</l>
                  <l>Occupat os flammis: illi ingens barba reluxit,</l>
                  <l>Nidoremque ambuſta dedit.</l>

The following image is not leſs ludicrous, nor leſs improperly placed.</p>
            <q>

            <p>It would however be too auſtere, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh altogether ludicrous images from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic poem.

In its more familiar tones, a ludicrous ſcene may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced without impropriety.

            <head>CHAP. IX. Of Uniformity and Variety.</head>
            <p>WHEN I apply myſelf to explain u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity and variety, and to ſhow how we are affected by theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it appears doubtful what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ought to be followed. I foreſee ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral difficulties in keeping cloſe to my text; and yet by indulging a range, ſuch as may be neceſſary for a clear view, I ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly incur the cenſure of wandering.—Be it ſo. One ought not to abandon the right track for fear of cenſure. The collateral matters, beſide, that will be introduced, are curious, and not of ſlight importance in the ſcience of human nature.</p>
            <p>The neceſſary ſucceſſion of perceptions, is a ſubject formerly handled, ſo far as it depends on the relations of objects and their
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0258100201:394"/>
mutual connections<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 1.</note>. But that ſubject is not exhauſted; and I take the liberty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce it a ſecond time, in order to explain in what manner we are affected by unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and variety. The world we inhabit is replete with things not leſs remarkable for their variety than their number. Theſe, unfolded by the wonderful mechaniſm of external ſenſe, furniſh the mind with many perceptions, which, joined with ideas of memory, of imagination, and of reflection, form a complete train that has not a gap or interval. This tide of objects, in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual flux, is in a good meaſure independent of will. The mind, as has been obſerved<note n="†" place="bottom">Locke, book 2. chap. 14.</note>, is ſo conſtituted, <q rend="inline">"That it can by no effort break off the ſucceſſion of its ideas, nor keep its attention long fixt upon the ſame object."</q> We can arreſt a percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its courſe; we can ſhorten its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duration, to make room for another; we can vary the ſucceſſion by change of place or amuſement; and we can in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0258100201:395"/>
prevent variety, by frequently recalling the ſame object after ſhort intervals: but ſtill there muſt be a ſucceſſion, and a change from one thing to another. By artificial means, the ſucceſſion may be retarded or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerated, may be rendered more various or more uniform, but in one ſhape or other is unavoidable.</p>
            <p>The rate of ſucceſſion, even when left to its ordinary courſe, is not always the ſame. There are natural cauſes that accelerate or retard it conſiderably. The firſt I ſhall mention depends on a peculiar conſtitution of mind. One man is diſtinguiſhed from another, by no circumſtance more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably than the movement of his train of perceptions. A cold languid temper is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a ſlow courſe of percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which occaſions dulneſs of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſluggiſhneſs in action. To a warm temper, on the contrary, belongs a quick courſe of perceptions, which occaſions quickneſs of apprehenſion and activity in buſineſs. The Aſiatic nations, the Chineſe eſpecially, are obſerved to be more cool and deliberate than the Europeans: may not
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0258100201:396"/>
the reaſon be, that heat enervates by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting the ſpirits? A certain degree of cold, ſuch as is felt in the middle regions of Europe, by bracing the fibres, rouſes the mind, and produces a briſk circulation of thought, accompanied with vigour in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In youth there is obſervable a quicker ſucceſſion of perceptions, than in old age. Hence in youth a remarkable avidity for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of amuſements, which in riper years give place to more uniform and more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date occupation. This qualifies men of middle age for buſineſs, where activity is required, but with a greater proportion of uniformity than variety. In old age, a ſlow and languid ſucceſſion makes variety unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and for that reaſon, the aged, in all their motions, are generally governed by an habitual uniformity. Whatever be the cauſe, we may venture to pronounce, that heat in the imagination and temper, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways connected with a briſk flow of percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The natural rate of ſucceſſion, depends alſo in ſome degree upon the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions that compoſe the train. An agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0258100201:397"/>
object, taking a ſtrong hold of the mind, occaſions a ſlower ſucceſſion than when the objects are indifferent. Grandeur and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty fix the attention for a conſiderable time, excluding all other ideas; and the mind thus occupied feels no vacuity. Some emotions, by hurrying the mind from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to object, accelerate the ſucceſſion. Where the train is compoſed of connected objects, the ſucceſſion is quick. For it is ſo ordered by nature, that the mind goes eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſweetly along connected objects<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 1.</note>. On the other hand, the ſucceſſion muſt be ſlow where the train is compoſed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected objects. An unconnected object, finding no ready acceſs to the mind, requires time to make an impreſſion. And that it is not admitted without a ſtruggle, appears from the unſettled ſtate of the mind for ſome moments after it is preſented, wavering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and the former train. During this ſhort period, one or other of the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will intrude, perhaps oftener than once, till the attention be fixt entirely upon
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0258100201:398"/>
the new object. The ſame obſervations are applicable to ideas ſuggeſted by language. The mind can bear a quick ſucceſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ideas. But an unrelated idea, for which the mind is not prepared, takes time to make a diſtinct impreſſion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a train compoſed of ſuch ideas, ought to proceed with a ſlow pace. Hence an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic poem, a play, or any ſtory connected in all its parts, may be peruſed in a ſhorter time, than a book of maxims or apothegms, of which a quick ſucceſſion creates both confuſion and fatigue.</p>
            <p>Such latitude hath nature indulged in the rate of ſucceſſion. What latitude it indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with reſpect to uniformity we proceed to examine. The uniformity or variety of a train, ſo far as compoſed of external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, depends on the particular objects that ſurround the percipient at the time. The preſent occupation muſt alſo have an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; one is ſometimes engaged in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of affairs, ſometimes altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. A natural train of ideas of memory is more circumſcribed, each object being linked, by ſome connection, to what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0258100201:399"/>
and to what follows it. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, which are many and of different kinds, afford ſcope for a ſufficient degree of variety; and at the ſame time prevent any exceſs that is unpleaſant. Temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution alſo have an influence here, as well as upon the rate of ſucceſſion. A man of a calm and ſedate temper, admits not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any idea but what is regularly introduced by a proper connection. One of a roving diſpoſition embraces with avidity every new idea, however ſlender its relation be to thoſe that go before it. Neither muſt we overlook the nature of the perceptions that compoſe the train; for their influence is not leſs with reſpect to uniformity and variety, than with reſpect to the rate of ſucceſſion. The mind ingroſſed by any paſſion, love or hatred, hope or fear, broods over its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and can bear no interruption. In ſuch a ſtate, the train of perceptions muſt not only be ſlow, but extremely uniform. Anger newly inflamed eagerly graſps its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and leaves not a cranny in the mind for another thought than of revenge. In the character of Hotſpur, this ſtate of mind
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0258100201:400"/>
is repreſented to the life; a picture remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for high colouring as well as for ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of imitation:

            <p>Having viewed a train of perceptions as directed by nature, and the variations it is ſuſceptible of from different neceſſary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we proceed to examine how far it is ſubjected to will; for that will hath ſome influence, more or leſs, is obſerved above. And firſt, the rate of ſucceſſion may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded by inſiſting upon one object, and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0258100201:402"/>
propelled by diſmiſſing another before its time. But ſuch voluntary mutations in the natural courſe of ſucceſſion, have limits that cannot be extended by the moſt painful efforts. The mind circumſcribed in its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, cannot, at the ſame inſtant, admit many perceptions; and when replete, it has no place for new perceptions till others be removed. For this reaſon, a voluntary change of perceptions cannot be inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; and the time it requires ſets bounds to the velocity of ſucceſſion. On the other hand, the power we have to arreſt a flying perception, is equally limited. The longer we detain any perception, the more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we find in the operation; till, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty becoming unſurmountable, we are forced to quit our hold, and to permit the train to take its uſual courſe.</p>
            <p>The power we have over this train as to uniformity and variety, is in ſome caſes very great, in others very little. A train ſo far as compoſed of external objects, depends entirely on the place we occupy, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not more or leſs variety but by change of place. A train compoſed of ideas of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0258100201:403"/>
is ſtill leſs under our power. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which are connected, afford the mind an eaſy paſſage from one to another. They ſuggeſt each other in idea by the ſame means; and we cannot at will call up any idea that is not connected with the train<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 1.</note>. But a train of ideas ſuggeſted by reading, may be varied at will, provided we have books in ſtore.</p>
            <p>This power which nature hath given us over our train of perceptions, may be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthened by proper diſcipline, and by an early application to buſineſs. Its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſtrength is remarkable in thoſe who have a ſtrong genius for the mathematics: nor leſs remarkable in perſons devoted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes, who paſs whole days in contemplation, and impoſe upon themſelves long and ſevere penances. It is not to be conceived, what length a habit of activity in affairs will carry ſome men. Let a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or let any perſon to whom the ſight is not familiar, attend the Chancellor of Great Britain through the labours but of one day,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0258100201:404"/>
during a ſeſſion of parliament: how great will be his aſtoniſhment! what multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of law-buſineſs, what deep thinking, and what elaborate application to matters of government! The train of perceptions muſt in this great man be accelerated far beyond the common courſe of nature. Yet no confuſion nor hurry; but in every article the greateſt order and accuracy. Such is the force of habit! How happy is man, to have the command of a principle of action, that can elevate him ſo far above the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition of humanity<note n="*" place="bottom">This chapter was compoſed in the year 1753.</note>!</p>
            <p>We are now ripe for conſidering a train of perceptions with reſpect to pleaſure and pain: and to this ſpeculation we muſt give peculiar attention, becauſe it ſerves to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the effects that uniformity and variety have upon the mind. A man is always in a pleaſant ſtate of mind, when his percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions flow in their natural courſe. He feels himſelf free, light, and eaſy, eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any forcible acceleration or retardation. On the other hand, the reſiſtance felt in retarding or accelerating the natural courſe, excites a pain, which, though ſcarcely felt
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0258100201:405"/>
in ſmall removes, becomes conſiderable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the extremes. An averſion to fix on any ſingle object for a long time, or to take in a multiplicity of objects in a ſhort time, is remarkable in children; and equally ſo in men unaccuſtomed to buſineſs. A man languiſhes when the ſucceſſion is very ſlow; and, if he grow not impatient, is apt to fall aſleep. During a rapid ſucceſſion, he hath a feeling as if his head were turning round. He is fatigued, and his pain reſembles that of wearineſs after bodily labour. External objects, when they occaſion a very ſlow or a very quick ſucceſſion, produce a pain of the ſame ſort with what it felt in a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry retardation or acceleration: which ſhows that the pain proceeds not from the violence of the action, but from the retardation or acceleration itſelf, diſturbing that free and eaſy courſe of ſucceſſion which is naturally pleaſant.</p>
            <p>But the mind is not ſatisfied with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate courſe alone: its perceptions muſt alſo be ſufficiently diverſified. Number without variety conſtitutes not an agreeable train. In comparing a few objects, unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0258100201:406"/>
is agreeable: but the frequent reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of uniform objects becomes unpleaſant. One tires of a ſcene that is not diverſified; and ſoon feels a ſort of unnatural reſtraint when confined within a narrow range, whether occaſioned by a retarded ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or by too great uniformity. An exceſs in variety is, on the other hand, fatiguing. This is even perceptible in a train compoſed of related objects: much more where the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are unrelated; for an object, unconnect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the former train, gains not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance without effort; and this effort, though ſcarce perceptible in a ſingle inſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes by frequent reiteration exceeding painful. Whatever be the cauſe, the fact is certain, that a man never finds himſelf more at eaſe, than when his perceptions ſucceed each other with a certain degree, not only of velocity, but alſo of variety. Hence it proceeds, that a train conſiſting entirely of ideas of memory, is never pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by too great variety; becauſe ſuch ideas are not introduced otherwiſe than according to their natural connections<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 1.</note>. The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0258100201:407"/>
of a train of ideas, is the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a reverie; eſpecially where the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination interpoſes, and is active in coining new ideas, which is done with wonderful facility. One muſt be ſenſible, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity and eaſe of the mind in this ſtate, makes a great part of the enjoyment. The caſe is different where external objects enter into the train; for theſe, making their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance without any order, and without any connection ſave that of contiguity, form a train of perceptions that may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely uniform or extremely diverſified; which, for oppoſite reaſons, are both of them painful.</p>
            <p>Any acceleration or retardation of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural run of perceptions, is painful even where it is voluntary. And it is equally painful to alter that degree of variety which nature requires. Contemplation, when the mind is long attached to one thing, ſoon becomes painful by reſtraining the free range of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Curioſity and the proſpect of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from uſeful diſcoveries, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a man to proſecute his ſtudies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the pain they give him;
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0258100201:408"/>
and a habit of cloſe attention, formed by frequent exerciſe, may ſoften the pain. But it is deeply felt by the bulk of mankind, and produceth in them an averſion to all abſtract ſciences. In any profeſſion or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a train of operation that is ſimple and reiterated without intermiſſion, makes the operator languiſh, and loſe his vigor. He complains neither of too great labour nor of too little action; but regrets the want of variety, and his being obliged to do the ſame thing over and over. Where the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration is ſufficiently varied, the mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its vigor, and is pleaſed with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Actions again create an uneaſineſs when exceſſive in number or variety, though in every other reſpect agreeable. This uneaſineſs is extremely remarkable, where ſtrict attention muſt be given, at the ſame time, to a number of different things. Thus a throng of buſineſs in law, in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, or in traffick, diſtreſſeth and diſtracts the mind, unleſs where a habit of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is acquired by long and conſtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. The exceſſive variety is the diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtance; and the mind ſuffers
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0258100201:409"/>
grievouſly by being kept conſtantly upon the ſtretch.</p>
            <p>With relation to involuntary cauſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing that degree of variety which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires, a ſlight pain affecting one part of the body without variation, becomes, by its conſtancy and long duration, almoſt inſupportable. The patient, ſenſible that the pain is not increaſed in degree, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of its conſtancy more than of its ſeverity, that it ingroſſes his whole thoughts, and gives admiſſion to no other object. Pain, of all feelings, ſeizes the attention with the greateſt force; and the mind, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruitleſs efforts to turn its view to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects more agreeable, muſt abandon itſelf to its tormentor. A ſhifting pain gives leſs uneaſineſs, becauſe change of place contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to variety. An intermitting pain, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering other objects to intervene, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by reiteration. Again, any ſingle colour or ſound often returning, becomes diſagreeable; as may be obſerved in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a train of ſimilar apartments painted with the ſame colour, and in hearing the prolonged tollings of a bell. Colour and
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0258100201:410"/>
ſound varied within certain limits, though without any order, are agreeable; witneſs a field variegated with many colours of plants and flowers, and the various notes of birds in a thicket. Increaſe the number or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and the feeling becomes unpleaſant. Thus a great variety of colours, crowded upon a ſmall canvas or in quick ſucceſſion, create an uneaſy feeling, which is prevented by putting the colours at a greater diſtance either of place or time. A number of voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a crowded aſſembly, a number of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals collected in a market, produce an unpleaſant emotion; though a few of them together, or all of them in a moderate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, would be agreeable. And becauſe of the ſame exceſs in variety, a number of pains felt in different parts of the body, at the ſame inſtant or in a rapid ſucceſſion, make an exquiſite torture.</p>
            <p>The foregoing doctrine concerning the train of perceptions, and the pleaſure or pain reſulting from that train in different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, will be confirmed by attending to the final cauſe of theſe effects. And as I am ſenſible that the mind, inflamed with
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0258100201:411"/>
ſpeculations of this kind ſo highly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is beyond meaſure diſpoſed to convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall be watchful to admit no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor remark but what appears ſolidly founded. With this caution I proceed to the inquiry. It is occaſionally obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, that perſons of a phlegmatic tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, having a ſluggiſh train of percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are indiſpoſed to action; and that activity conſtantly accompanies a briſk mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perceptions. To aſcertain this fact, a man need not go abroad for experiments. Reflecting upon things paſſing in his own mind, he will find, that a briſk circulation of thought conſtantly prompts him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that he is averſe to action when his perceptions languiſh in their courſe. But man by nature is formed for action, and he muſt be active in order to be happy. Nature therefore hath kindly provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt indolence, by annexing pleaſure to a moderate courſe of perceptions, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king every remarkable retardation painful. A ſlow courſe of perceptions is attended with another bad effect. Man in a few capital caſes is governed by propenſity or
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0258100201:412"/>
inſtinct; but in matters that admit delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and choice, reaſon is aſſigned him for a guide. Now, as reaſoning requires often a great compaſs of ideas, their ſucceſſion ought to be ſo quick, as readily to furniſh every motive that may be neceſſary for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation. In a languid ſucceſſion, motives will often occur after action is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, when it is too late to retreat.</p>
            <p>Nature hath guarded man, her favourite, againſt a ſucceſſion too rapid, not leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than againſt one too ſlow. Both are equally painful, though the pain is not the ſame in both. Many are the good effects of this contrivance. In the firſt place, as the bodily faculties are by certain painful ſenſations confined within proper limits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which it would be dangerous to ſtrain the tender organs, Nature, in like manner, is equally provident with reſpect to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler faculties of the mind. Thus the pain of an accelerated courſe of perceptions, is Nature's admonition to relax our pace, and to admit a more gentle exertion of thought. Another valuable purpoſe may be gathered, from conſidering in what manner objects
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0258100201:413"/>
are imprinted upon the mind. To make ſuch an impreſſion as to give the memory faſt hold of the object, time is required, even where attention is the greateſt; and a moderate degree of attention, which is the common caſe, muſt be continued ſtill long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to produce the ſame effect. A rapid ſucceſſion then muſt prevent objects from making impreſſions ſo deep as to be of real ſervice in life; and Nature accordingly for the ſake of memory, has by a painful feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guarded againſt a rapid ſucceſſion. But a ſtill more valuable purpoſe is anſwered by this contrivance. As, on the one hand, a ſluggiſh courſe of perceptions indiſpoſeth to action; ſo, on the other, a courſe too rapid impels to raſh and precipitant action. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct is the child of deliberation and clear conception, for which there is no place in a rapid courſe of thought. Nature therefore, taking meaſures for prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, has guarded us effectually from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy of thought, by making it painful.</p>
            <p>Nature not only provides againſt a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion too ſlow or too quick, but makes the middle courſe extremely pleaſant. Nor is
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0258100201:414"/>
this middle courſe confined within narrow bounds. Every man can naturally without pain accelerate or retard in ſome degree the rate of his perceptions; and he can do this in a ſtill greater degree by the force of habit. Thus a habit of contemplation annihilates the pain of a retarded courſe of perceptions; and a buſy life, after long practice, makes acceleration pleaſant.</p>
            <p>Concerning the final cauſe of our taſte for variety, it will be conſidered, that human affairs, complex by variety as well as num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, require the diſtributing our attention and activity, in meaſure and proportion. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therefore, to ſecure a juſt diſtribution correſponding to the variety of human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, has made too great uniformity or too great variety in the courſe of our percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions equally unpleaſant. And indeed, were we addicted to either extreme, our internal conſtitution would be ill ſuited to our exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal circumſtances. At the ſame time, where a frequent reiteration of the ſame operation is required, as in ſeveral manufactures, or a quick circulation, as in law or phyſic, Nature, attentive to all our wants, hath alſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0258100201:415"/>
for theſe caſes. She hath implanted in the breaſt of every perſon, an efficacious principle, which leads to habit. By an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate perſeverance in the ſame occupation, the pain of exceſſive uniformity vaniſheth; and by the like perſeverance in a quick cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of different occupations, the pain of exceſſive variety vaniſheth. And thus we come to take delight in ſeveral occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that by nature, without habit, are not a little diſguſtful.</p>
            <p>A middle rate alſo in our train of percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions betwixt uniformity and variety, is not leſs pleaſant, than betwixt quickneſs and ſlowneſs. The mind of man thus conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is wonderfully adapted to the courſe of human affairs, which are continually chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, but not without connection. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually adapted to the acquiſition of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which reſults chiefly from diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſemblances among differing objects, and differences among reſembling objects. Such occupation, even abſtracting from the knowledge we acquire, is in itſelf delightful, by preſerving a middle rate betwixt too great uniformity and too great variety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:0258100201:416"/>
We are now arrived at the chief purpoſe of the preſent chapter; and that is to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how far uniformity or variety ought to be ſtudied in the fine arts. And the knowledge we have obtained, will even at firſt view ſuggeſt a general obſervation, That in every work of art, it muſt be agreeable to find that degree of variety which correſponds to the natural courſe of our perceptions; and that an exceſs in variety or in uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt be diſagreeable by varying that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural courſe. For this reaſon, works of art admit more or leſs variety according to the nature of the ſubject. In a picture that ſtrongly attaches the ſpectator to a ſingle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the mind reliſheth not a multiplicity of figures or of ornaments. A picture again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting a gay ſubject, admits great variety of figures and ornaments; becauſe theſe are agreeable to the mind in a chearful tone. The ſame obſervation is applicable to poetry and to muſic.</p>
            <p>It muſt at the ſame time be remarked, that one can bear a greater variety of natural objects than of objects in a picture; and a greater variety in a picture than in a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0258100201:417"/>
A real object preſented to the view, makes an impreſſion more readily than when repreſented in colours, and much more readily than when repreſented in words. Hence it is, that the profuſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of objects in ſome natural landſcapes, neither breed confuſion nor fatigue. And for the ſame reaſon, there is place for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er variety of ornament in a picture, than in a poem.</p>
            <p>From theſe general obſervations I proceed to particulars. In works expoſed continually to public view, variety ought to be ſtudied. It is a rule accordingly in ſculpture, to contraſt the different limbs of a ſtatue, in order to give it all the variety poſſible. Though the cone in a ſingle view be more beautiful than the pyramid; yet a pyramidal ſteeple, becauſe of its variety, is juſtly preferred. For the ſame reaſon, the oval in compoſitions is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the circle; and painters, in copying buildings or any regular work, endeavour to give an air of variety by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the ſubject in an angular view: we are pleaſed with the variety without loſing
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0258100201:418"/>
ſight of the regularity. In a landſcape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting animals, thoſe eſpecially of the ſame kind, contraſt ought to prevail. To draw one ſleeping another awake, one ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another in motion, one moving toward the ſpectator another from him, is the life of ſuch a performance.</p>
            <p>In every ſort of writing intended for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, variety is neceſſary in proportion to the length of the work. Want of variety is ſenſibly felt in Davila's hiſtory of the civil wars of France. The events are indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and various: but the reader lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth by a tireſome uniformity of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; every perſon engaged being figured a conſummate politician, governed by intereſt only. It is hard to ſay, whether Ovid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts more by too great variety or too great uniformity. His ſtories are all of the ſame kind, concluding invariably with the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of one being into another. So far he is tireſome with exceſs in uniformity. He alſo fatigues with exceſs in variety, by hurrying his reader inceſſantly from ſtory to ſtory. Arioſto is ſtill more fatiguing than Ovid, by exceeding the juſt bounds of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0258100201:419"/>
Not ſatisfied, like Ovid, with a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his ſtories, he diſtracts the reader by jumbling together a multitude of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected events. Nor is the Orlando Furioſo leſs tireſome by its uniformity than the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſes, though in a different manner. After a ſtory is brought to a criſis, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, intent upon the cataſtrophe, is ſuddenly ſnatched away to a new ſtory, which is little regarded ſo long as the mind is occupied with the former. This tantalizing method, from which the author never once ſwerves during the courſe of a long work, beſide its uniformity, hath another bad effect: it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents that ſympathy which is raiſed by an intereſting event when the reader meets with no interruption.</p>
            <p>The emotions produced by our percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a train, have been little conſidered, and leſs underſtood. The ſubject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore required an elaborate diſcuſſion. It may ſurpriſe ſome readers, to find variety treated as only contributing to make a train of perceptions pleaſant, when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly held to be a neceſſary ingredient in beauty of whatever kind; according to the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0258100201:420"/>
definition, <q rend="inline">"That beauty conſiſts in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity amidſt variety."</q> But after the ſubject is explained and illuſtrated as above, I preſume it will be evident, that this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, however applicable to one or other ſpecies, is far from being juſt with reſpect to beauty in general. Variety contributes no ſhare to the beauty of a moral action, nor of a mathematical theorem; and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs are the beautiful objects of ſight that have little or no variety in them. A globe, the moſt uniform of all figures, is of all the moſt beautiful; and a ſquare, though more beautiful than a trapezium, hath leſs variety in its conſtituent parts. The foregoing defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which at beſt is but obſcurely expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is only applicable to a number of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in a group or in ſucceſſion, among which indeed a due mixture of uniformity and variety is always agreeable, provided the particular objects, ſeparately conſidered, be in any degree beautiful. Uniformity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt variety among ugly objects, affords no pleaſure. This circumſtance is totally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the definition; and indeed to have mentioned it, would at firſt glance
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0258100201:421"/>
ſhow the definition to be imperfect. To define beauty as ariſing from beautiful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects blended together in a due proportion of uniformity and variety, would be too groſs to paſs current; as nothing can be more groſs, than to employ in a definition the very term that is propoſed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
            <div type="appendix">
               <head>APPENDIX to Chap. IX. Concerning the works of nature.</head>
               <p>IN natural objects, whether we regard their internal or external ſtructure, beauty and deſign are equally conſpicuous. We ſhall begin with the outſide of nature, as what firſt preſents itſelf.</p>
               <p>The figure of an organic body, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally regular. The trunk of a tree, its branches, and their ramifications, are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round, and form a ſeries regularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing from the trunk to the ſmalleſt fibre. Uniformity is no where more remarkable
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0258100201:422"/>
than in the leaves, which, in the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, have all the ſame colour, ſize, and ſhape. The ſeeds and fruits are all regular figures, approaching for the moſt part to the globular form. Hence a plant, eſpecially of the larger kind, with its trunk, branches, foliage, and fruit, is a delightful object.</p>
               <p>In an animal, the trunk, which is much larger than the other parts, occupies a chief place. Its ſhape, like that of the ſtem of plants, is nearly round; a figure which of all is the moſt agreeable. Its two ſides are preciſely ſimilar. Several of the under parts go off in pairs; and the two individuals of each pair are accurately uniform. The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle parts are placed in the middle. The limbs, bearing a certain proportion to the trunk, ſerve to ſupport it, and to give it a proper elevation. Upon one extremity are diſpoſed the neck and head, in the direction of the trunk. The head being the chief part, poſſeſſes with great propriety the chief place. Hence, the beauty of the whole fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, is the reſult of many equal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional parts orderly diſpoſed; and the ſmalleſt variation in number, equality, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0258100201:423"/>
or order, never fails to produce a perception of uglineſs and deformity.</p>
               <p>Nature in no particular ſeems more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of ornament, than in the beautiful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring of her works. The flowers of plants, the furs of beaſts, and the feathers of birds, vie with each other in the beauty of their colours, which in luſtre as well as in harmony are beyond the power of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of all natural appearances, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring of the human face is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. It is the ſtrongeſt inſtance of the ineffable art of nature, in adapting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning its colours to the magnitude, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and poſition, of the parts. In a word, colour ſeems to live in nature only, and to languiſh under the fineſt touches of art.</p>
               <p>When we examine the internal ſtructure of a plant or animal, a wonderful ſubtility of mechaniſm is diſplayed. Man, in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical operations, is confined to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of bodies. But the operations of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are exerted through the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo as to reach even the elementary parts. Thus the body of an animal, and of a plant, are compoſed of certain great
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0258100201:424"/>
veſſels; theſe of ſmaller; and theſe again of ſtill ſmaller, without end ſo far we can diſcover. This power of diffuſing mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm through the moſt intimate parts, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to nature; and diſtinguiſhes her ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, moſt remarkably, from every work of art. Such texture, continued from the groſſer parts to the moſt minute, preſerves all along the ſtricteſt regularity. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of plants are a bundle of cylindric ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, lying in the ſame direction, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel or nearly parallel to each other. In ſome inſtances, a moſt accurate arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of parts is diſcovered, as in onions, formed of concentric coats one within another to the very centre. An animal body is ſtill more admirable, in the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its internal parts, and in their order and ſymmetry. There is not a bone, a muſcle, a blood-veſſel, a nerve, that hath not one correſponding to it on the oppoſite ſide of the animal; and the ſame order is carried through the moſt minute parts. The lungs are compoſed of two parts, which are diſpoſed upon the ſides of the thorax; and the kidneys, in a lower ſituation, have a
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0258100201:425"/>
poſition not leſs orderly. As to the parts that are ſingle, the heart is advantageouſly ſituated nigh the middle. The liver, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and ſpleen, are diſpoſed in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per region of the abdomen, about the ſame height: the bladder is placed in the middle of the body; as well as the inteſtinal canal, which fills the whole cavity by its convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
               <p>The mechanical power of nature, not confined to ſmall bodies, reacheth equally thoſe of the greateſt ſize; witneſs the bodies that compoſe the ſolar ſyſtem, which, however large, are weighed, meaſured, and ſubjected to certain laws, with the utmoſt accuracy. Their places around the ſun, with their diſtances, are determined by a preciſe rule, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding to their quantities of matter. The ſuperior dignity of the central body, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its bulk and lucid appearance, is ſuited to the place it occupies. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bular figure of theſe bodies, is not only in itſelf beautiful, but is above all others fitted for regular motion. Each planet revolves about its own axis in a given time; and each moves round the ſun, in an orbit
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0258100201:426"/>
nearly circular, and in a time proportioned to its diſtance. Their velocities, directed by an eſtabliſhed law, are perpetually chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by regular accelerations and retarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In fine, the great variety of regular appearances, joined with the beauty of the ſyſtem itſelf, cannot fail to produce the higheſt delight in every perſon who can taſte deſign, power, or beauty.</p>
               <p>Nature hath a wonderful power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting ſyſtems with each other, and of propagating that connection through all her works. Thus the conſtituent parts of a plant, the roots, the ſtem, the branches, the leaves, the fruit, are really different ſyſtems, united by a mutual dependence on each other. Thus in an animal, the lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic and lacteal ducts, the blood-veſſels and nerves, the muſcles and glands, the bones and cartilages, the membranes and viſcera, with the other organs, form diſtinct ſyſtems, which are united into one whole. There are, at the ſame time, other connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions leſs intimate. Thus every plant is joined to the earth by its roots; it requires rain and dews to furniſh it with juices; and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0258100201:427"/>
it requires heat to preſerve theſe juices in fluidity and motion. Thus every animal, by its gravity, is connected with the earth, with the element in which it breathes, and with the ſun, by deriving from it cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enlivening heat. The earth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth aliment to plants, theſe to animals, and theſe again to other animals, in a long train of dependence. That the earth is part of a greater ſyſtem, comprehending many bodies mutually attracting each other, and gravitating all toward one common centre, is now thoroughly explored. Such a regular and uniform ſeries of connections, propagated through ſo great a number of beings and through ſuch wide ſpaces, is wonderful: and our wonder muſt increaſe, when we obſerve this connection propagated from the minuteſt atoms to bodies of the moſt enormous ſize, and widely diffuſed, ſo as that we can neither perceive its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor its end. That it doth not termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate within our own planetary ſyſtem, is certain. The connection is diffuſed over ſpaces ſtill more remote, where new bodies and ſyſtems riſe to our view, without end. All ſpace is filled with the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0258100201:428"/>
works of God, which, being the operation of one hand, are formed by one plan, to anſwer one great end.</p>
               <p>But the moſt wonderful connection of all, though not the moſt conſpicuous, is that of our internal frame with the works of nature. Man is obviouſly fitted for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating theſe works, becauſe in this contemplation he has great delight. The works of nature are remarkable in their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity not leſs than in their variety; and the mind of man is fitted to receive pleaſure equally from both. Uniformity and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety are interwoven in the works of nature with ſurpriſing art. Variety, however great, is never without ſome degree of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity; nor the greateſt uniformity, without ſome degree of variety. There is great variety in the ſame plant, by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent appearances of its ſtem, branches, leaves, bloſſoms, fruit, ſize, and colour; and yet when we trace this variety through different plants, eſpecially of the ſame kind, there is diſcovered a ſurpriſing uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. Again, where nature ſeems to have intended the moſt exact uniformity,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0258100201:429"/>
as among individuals of the ſame kind, there ſtill appears a diverſity, which ſerves readily to diſtinguiſh one individual from another. It is indeed admirable, that the human viſage, in which uniformity is ſo prevalent, ſhould yet be ſo marked as to leave no room for miſtaking one perſon for another. The difference, though clearly perceived, is often ſo minute as to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of deſcription. A corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence ſo perfect betwixt the human mind and the works of nature, is extremely remarkable. The oppoſition betwixt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and uniformity is ſo great, that one would not readily imagine they could both be reliſhed by the ſame palate; at leaſt not in the ſame object, nor at the ſame time. It is however true, that the pleaſures they afford, being happily adjuſted to each other, and readily mixing in intimate union, are frequently produced in perfection by the ſame individual object. Nay further, in the objects that touch us the moſt, unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and variety are conſtantly combined; witneſs natural objects, where this combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is always found in perfection. It is
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0258100201:430"/>
for that reaſon, that natural objects readily form themſelves into groups, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable in whatever manner combined: a wood with its trees, ſhrubs, and herbs, is agreeable: the muſic of birds, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of cattle, and the murmuring of a brook, are in conjunction delightful; though they ſtrike the ear without modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or harmony. In ſhort, nothing can be more happily accommodated to the inward conſtitution of man, than that mixture of uniformity with variety which the eye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers in natural objects. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the mind is never more highly gratified than in contemplating a natural landſcape.</p>
