            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AN ESSAY ON MUSICAL EXPRESSION.</p>

            <p>To which is added, A LETTER to the AUTHOR, concerning the Muſic of the ANCIENTS, and ſome Paſſages in CLASSIC WRITERS, relating to that Subject.</p>
            <p>LIKEWISE, Mr. AVISON's REPLY to the Author of <hi>Remarks on the Eſſay on</hi> MUSICAL EXPRESSION. In a Letter from Mr. <hi>Aviſon,</hi> to his Friend in <hi>London.</hi>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>AS there are ſeveral muſical terms, which will frequently occur in the courſe of this Eſſay, and which are not always ſufficiently attended to; it may therefore be neceſſary, for the ſake of thoſe who are not particularly converſant in Muſic, to explain them according to their moſt general acceptation.</p>
            <p>And, firſt, the term MELODY may be defined the <hi>means</hi> or method of ranging <hi>ſingle</hi> muſical ſounds in a regular progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, either aſcending or deſcending, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſtabliſhed principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0666900500:3"/>
HARMONY is the method of ranging two or more <hi>concording</hi> muſical ſounds; or the agreeable <hi>union</hi> of them in ſeveral parts, when ſung or played together. As therefore a continued ſucceſſion of <hi>ſingle</hi> muſical ſounds produces <hi>melody,</hi> ſo does a continued <hi>combination</hi> of theſe produce <hi>harmony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MODULATION is the effect of <hi>ſingle,</hi> or <hi>concording</hi> muſical ſounds, ſucceeding one another in an <hi>arbitrary</hi> but <hi>agreeable</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, paſſing from one <hi>key</hi> to another; and therefore doth as well relate to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined,</hi> as to <hi>ſingle</hi> muſical ſounds.</p>
            <p>BY the word <hi>Key,</hi> is meant, a regular ſucceſſion of any eight <hi>natural notes:</hi> the loweſt note, being conſidered as the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,</hi> is therefore called the <hi>key-note;</hi> all
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0666900500:4"/>
the other notes in that key being ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to it.</p>
            <p>CADENCES in Muſic, are the ſame as ſtops in ſpeaking or writing; being, in like manner, the proper terminations, either of a part, or of the whole of a compoſition.</p>
            <p>THE term <hi>Subject</hi> (or <hi>Fugue</hi> or <hi>Air</hi>) is, in a muſical ſenſe, what the word <hi>Subject</hi> likewiſe implies in writing. The term <hi>Air,</hi> in ſome caſes, includes the manner of handling or carrying on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>PASSAGES in Muſic, are alſo like <hi>Sentences</hi> or <hi>Paragraphs</hi> in writing. This laſt term hath ſometimes been uſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note <hi>Graces,</hi> or <hi>extempore Flouriſhings</hi> only. But in this latter ſenſe we ſhall never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, the former definition being more
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0666900500:5"/>
ſtrictly juſt, according to its original ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, and therefore more applicable to the intention of this Eſſay.</p>
            <p>MUSIC is ſaid to be in <hi>Score,</hi> when all the parts are diſtinctly wrote and ſet under each other, ſo as the eye, at one view, may take in all the various contrivances of the compoſer.</p>

               <p>AS the public inclination for Muſic ſeems every day advancing, it may not be amiſs, at this time, to offer a few obſervations on that delightful art; ſuch obſervations, I mean, as may be chiefly applicable to the preſent times; ſuch as may tend to correct any errors that have ariſen, either in the compoſition, or the practice of muſic.</p>

                     </gap> chord</hi> ſtruck, or a beautiful ſucceſſion of <hi>ſingle ſounds</hi> produced, is no leſs raviſhing to the ear, than juſt ſymmetry or exquiſite colours to the eye.</p>
               <p>The capacity of receiving pleaſure from theſe muſical ſounds, is, in fact, a peculiar and internal ſenſe; but of a much more refined nature than the external ſenſes: for in the pleaſures ariſing from our internal ſenſe of harmony, there is no prior uneaſineſs neceſſary, in order to our taſting them in their full perfection; neither is the enjoyment of them attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either with languor or diſguſt. It is their peculiar and eſſential property, to diveſt the ſoul of every unquiet paſſion, to pour in upon the mind a ſilent and ſerene joy, beyond the power of words to expreſs, and to fix the heart in a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0666900500:10"/>
rational, benevolent, and happy tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.</p>
               <p>But, though this be the natural effect of <hi>melody</hi> or <hi>harmony</hi> on the imagination, when ſimply conſidered; yet when to theſe is added the force of <hi>Muſical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> the effect is greatly increaſed; for then they aſſume the power of excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the moſt agreeable paſſions of the ſoul. The force of ſound in alarming the paſſions is prodigious. Thus, the noiſe of thunder, the ſhouts of war, the uproar of an enraged ocean, ſtrike us with terror: ſo again, there are certain ſounds natural to joy, others to grief or deſpondency, others to tenderneſs and love; and by hearing <hi>theſe,</hi> we naturally ſympathize with thoſe who either <hi>enjoy</hi> or <hi>ſuffer.</hi> Thus muſic, either by imitating theſe various ſounds in due ſubordination to the laws of <hi>air</hi> and <hi>harmony,</hi> or by any other method of aſſociation, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the objects of our paſſions before us (eſpecially when thoſe objects are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and made as it were viſibly and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0666900500:11"/>
intimately preſent to the imagination by the help of words) does naturally raiſe a variety of paſſions in the human breaſt, ſimilar to the ſounds which are expreſſed: and thus, by the muſician's art, we are often carried into the fury of a battle or a tempeſt, we are by turns elated with joy, or ſunk in pleaſing ſorrow, rouzed to courage, or quelled by grateful terrors, melted into pity, tenderneſs, and love, or tranſported to the regions of bliſs, in an extacy of divine praiſe.</p>
               <p>But beyond this, I think we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſert, that it is the peculiar quality of Muſic to raiſe the <hi>ſociable and happy paſſions,</hi> and to <hi>ſubdue</hi> the <hi>contrary ones.</hi> I know it has been generally believed and affirmed, that its power extends alike to every affection of the mind. But I would offer it to the conſideration of the public, whether this is not a general and fundamental error. I would appeal to any man, whether ever he found himſelf urged to acts of ſelfiſhneſs, cruelty, treachery, revenge, or malevolence, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0666900500:12"/>
the power of muſical ſounds? or if he ever found jealouſy, ſuſpicion, or ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude engendered in his breaſt, either from HARMONY or DISCORD? I believe no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this nature can be alledged with truth. It muſt be owned, indeed, that the force of muſic may urge the <hi>paſſions</hi> to an exceſs, or it may fix them on falſe and improper objects, and may thus be pernicious in its effects: but ſtill the paſſions which it raiſes, though they may be <hi>miſled</hi> or <hi>exceſſive,</hi> are of the benevolent and ſocial kind, and in their intent at leaſt are diſintereſted and noble<note n="a" place="bottom">Leſt the two paſſions above-mentioned, of <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>grief,</hi> ſhould be thought an exception to this rule, it may not be improper to remark as to the firſt, that the <hi>terror</hi> raiſed by <hi>Muſical Expreſſion,</hi> is always of that grateful kind, which ariſes from an impreſſion of ſomething terrible to the imagination, but which is immediately diſſipated, by a ſubſequent conviction that the danger is entirely imaginary: of the ſame kind is the terror raiſed in us, when we ſtand near the edge of a precipice, or in ſight of a tempeſtuous ocean, or are preſent at a tragical repreſentation on the ſtage: in all theſe caſes, as in that of muſical expreſſion, the ſenſe of our <hi>ſecurity</hi> mixes itſelf with the terrible impreſſions, and melts them into a very ſenſible delight. As to the ſecond inſtance, that of grief, it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that as it always has ſomething of the ſocial kind for its foundation, ſo it is often attended with a kind of ſenſation, which may with truth be called <hi>pleaſing.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0666900500:13"/>
As I take this to be the truth of the caſe, ſo it ſeems to me no difficult matter to aſſign a ſufficient reaſon for it: we have already ſeen that it is the natural effect of air or harmony to throw the mind into a pleaſurable ſtate: and when it hath obtained this ſtate, it will of courſe exert thoſe powers, and be ſuſceptible of thoſe paſſions, which are the moſt natural and agreeable to it. Now theſe are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the benevolent ſpecies; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we know that the contrary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſuch as anger, revenge, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, and hatred, are always attended with anxiety and pain: whereas all the various modifications of love, whether human or divine, are but ſo many kinds of immediate happineſs. From this view of things therefore it neceſſarily follows, that every ſpecies of muſical ſound muſt tend to diſpel the malevolent paſſions, becauſe they are <hi>painful;</hi> and nouriſh
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0666900500:14"/>
thoſe which are benevolent, becauſe they are <hi>pleaſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt general and ſtriking inſtance of the power of Muſic, perhaps, that we know of, is that related of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> by POLYBIUS, in the fourth book of his hiſtory; which, as it expreſsly coincides with the ſubject in queſtion, I ſhall ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to give the reader entire.</p>
               <p>This judicious hiſtorian, ſpeaking of the cruelties exerciſed upon the <hi>Cynaethians</hi> by the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and the little compaſſion that their neighbours had ſhewn them; after having deſcribed the calamities of this people, abhorred by all <hi>Greece,</hi> adds the following remarks: <q rend="inline">
                     <p>"As the <hi>Arcadians</hi> are eſteemed by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> not only for the gentleneſs of their manners, their beneficence and humanity towards ſtrangers, but alſo for their piety to the gods; it may not be amiſs to examine, in few words, with regard to the ferocity of the <hi>Cynae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> how it is poſſible, being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable <hi>Arcadians</hi> from their origin,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0666900500:15"/>
they are become ſo much diſtinguiſhed by their cruelty, and all manner of crimes, from the other <hi>Greeks</hi> of this time. I believe, it can only be imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their having been the firſt and ſole people of all the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> who were eſtranged from the laudable inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of their anceſtors, founded upon the natural wants of all thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit <hi>Arcadia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"The ſtudy of Muſic (I mean that which is worthy the name) has its utility every-where; but it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary among the <hi>Arcadians.</hi> For we muſt not adopt the ſentiment of <hi>Ephorus,</hi> who, in the beginning of his writings, advances this propoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him: <hi>that Muſic is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced amongſt men, as a kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, only to deceive and miſlead them.</hi> Neither ſhould we imagine that it is without reaſon, that the ancient people of <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> have preferred the uſe of ſoft Muſic in war, to that of the trumpet; or, that the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0666900500:16"/>
                        <hi>Arcadians,</hi> in eſtabliſhing their repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, although in other reſpects extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auſtere in their manner of living, have ſhewn to Muſic ſo high a regard, that they not only teach this art to their children, but even compel their youth to a ſtudy of it to the age of thirty. Theſe facts are notoriouſly known. It is alſo known, that the <hi>Arcadians</hi> are almoſt the only people, among whom their youth, in obedience to the laws, habituate themſelves from their infancy, to ſing <hi>hymns</hi> and <hi>paeans,</hi> as is uſual among them, to the honour of the gods and heroes of their country. They are likewiſe taught the airs of <hi>Philoxenus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus;</hi> after which, every year, during the feaſts of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> this youth are divided into two bands, the one conſiſting of boys, the other of their young men, who, to the muſic of flutes, dance in their theatres with great emulation, celebrating thoſe games which take their names from each troop. Even in their aſſemblies and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0666900500:17"/>
parties of pleaſure, the <hi>Arcadians</hi> divert themſelves leſs in converſation, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of ſtories, than in ſinging by turns, and inviting each other recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to this exerciſe. It is no diſgrace with them, to own their ignorance of other arts: but they cannot deny their ability in ſinging, becauſe, at all events, they are neceſſitated to acquire this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; nor, in confeſſing their ſkill, can they exempt themſelves from giving proofs of it, as that would be deemed amongſt them a particular infamy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, at the care and expence of the public, their youth are trained in dancing and military exerciſes, which they perform to the muſic of flutes; and every year give proof of their abilities in the preſence of their fellow-citizens.</p>
                     <p>"Now it ſeems to me, that the firſt legiſlators, in forming ſuch kind of eſtabliſhments, have not had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of introducing luxury and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy; but that they have chiefly had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0666900500:18"/>
in view the way of living among the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> which their manual and toilſome exerciſes rendered extremely laborious and ſevere; and the auſtere manners of this people, to which the coldneſs and ſeverity of the air in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every part of <hi>Arcadia</hi> did greatly contribute.</p>
                     <p>"For it is natural to partake of the quality of this element. Thence it is, that different people, in proportion to the diſtance which ſeparates them, differ from each other, not only in their exterior form and colour, but alſo in their cuſtoms and employments. The legiſlators, therefore, willing to ſoften and temper this ferocity and rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> made all thoſe regulations which I have here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and inſtituted, beſides theſe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſemblies and ſacrifices, as well for the men, as for the women; and alſo dances for their children of both ſexes. In a word, they contrived all kinds of expedients to ſoften and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage,

by this culture of their man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners, the natural rudeneſs and barbari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Arcadians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"But the <hi>Cynaethians,</hi> who inhabit the moſt rude and ſavage parts of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi> having neglected all thoſe helps of which, on that account, they had ſo much the more occaſion; and being, on the contrary, ſubject to mutual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and conteſts, they are, at length, become ſo fierce and barbarous, that there is not a city in <hi>Greece,</hi> where ſuch frequent and enormous crimes are committed, as in that of <hi>Cynaetha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"An inſtance of the unhappy ſtate of this people, and of the averſion of all the <hi>Arcadians</hi> to their form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is the treatment that was ſhewn to their deputies which they ſent to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> after the horrible maſſacre in <hi>Cynaetha.</hi> In all the towns of <hi>Arcadia</hi> which theſe deputies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, immediate notice was given by an herald, that they ſhould inſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.

after the departure of theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys, went ſo far, as to purify themſelves by expiatory ſacrifices, and to carry the victims round the city and its territories, to purify both the one and the other.</p>

Still farther to confirm what is here advanced on the power of Muſic in raiſing the ſocial and nobler paſſions only, I wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> tranſcribe a paſſage from the celebrated <hi>Baron de</hi> MONTESQUIEU.</p>
               <p>This learned and ſenſible writer, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverting on the ſevere inſtitutions of the Ancients in regard to manners, having referred to ſeveral authorities among the <hi>Greeks</hi> on this head, particularly to the relation of POLYBIUS above quoted, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus.—<q rend="inline">"In the <hi>Greek</hi> republics the magiſtrates were extremely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed. They would not have the citizens apply themſelves to trade, to agriculture, or to the arts; and yet they would not have them idle. They found, therefore, employment for them
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0666900500:22"/>
in gymnaſtic and military exerciſes; and none elſe were allowed by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Hence the <hi>Greeks</hi> muſt be conſidered as a ſociety of wreſtlers and boxers. Now theſe exerciſes having a natural tendency to render people har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and fierce, there was a neceſſity for tempering them with others that might ſoften their manners. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Muſic, which influences the mind by means of corporeal organs, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely proper. It is a kind of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between the bodily exerciſes that render men fierce and hardy, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative ſciences that render them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable and ſour. It cannot be ſaid that Muſic inſpired virtue, for this would be inconceivable: but it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the effects of a ſavage inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inabled the ſoul to have ſuch a ſhare in the education, as it could never have had without the aſſiſtance of harmony.
<p>"Let us ſuppoſe among ourſelves a ſociety of men, ſo paſſionately fond of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0666900500:23"/>
hunting, as to make it their ſole em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ployment; theſe people would doubt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſs contract a kind of ruſticity and fierceneſs. But if they happened to receive a taſte for Muſic, we ſhould quickly perceive a ſenſible difference in their cuſtoms and manners. In ſhort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the exerciſes uſed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> excited only one kind of paſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, anger, and cruelty. But Muſic excites them all; it is able to inſpire the ſoul with a ſenſe of pity, lenity, tenderneſs, and love. Our moral writers, who declaim ſo vehemently againſt the ſtage, ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the power of Muſic over the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>"If the ſociety above-mentioned were to have no other Muſic than that of drums and the ſound of the trumpet, would it not be more difficult to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this end, than by the more melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tones of ſofter harmony? The Antients were therefore in the right, when under particular circumſtances
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0666900500:24"/>
they preferred one mode to another in regard to manners.</p>
                     <p>"But ſome will aſk, why ſhould Muſic be pitched upon preferable to any other entertainment? It is, becauſe of all ſenſible pleaſures there is none that leſs corrupts the ſoul<note n="c" place="bottom">Spirit of Laws, vol. I. p. 56.</note>."</p>

               </p>
               <p>The fact the baron ſpeaks of, ſeems to confirm what is here ſaid on the power of Muſic: for we ſee that Muſic was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to awaken the nobler paſſions only, ſuch as pity, lenity, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and love. But ſhould a ſtate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Muſic to give a roughneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or inſpire the contrary paſſions of hard-heartedneſs, anger, and cruelty, it would certainly miſs its aim; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the baron ſeems to ſuppoſe the contrary. For he hath not alledged any inſtance, or any kind of proof in ſupport of his ſuppoſition. It is true, as he obſerves in the ſecond paragraph, that the ſound of drums or trumpets would have a different effect from the more

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of a good picture; ſo the judicious mixture
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0666900500:28"/>
of concords and diſcords is equally eſſential to a muſical compoſition: as ſhades are neceſſary to relieve the eye, which is ſoon tired and diſguſted with a level glare of light; ſo diſcords are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to relieve the ear, which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe immediately ſatiated with a continued and unvaried ſtrain of harmony. We may add (for the ſake of thoſe who are in any degree acquainted with the theory of Muſic) that the <hi>preparations</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions</hi> of diſcords, reſemble the ſoft gradations from light to ſhade, or from ſhade to light, in Painting.</p>
               <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> As in Painting there are three various degrees of diſtances eſtabliſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>fore-ground,</hi> the <hi>intermediate part,</hi> and the <hi>off-ſkip;</hi> ſo in Muſic there are three different parts ſtrictly ſimilar to theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the baſs (or fore-ground), the tenor (or intermediate), and the treble (or off-ſkip). In conſequence of this, a muſical compoſition without its baſs, is like a landſcape without its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground; without its tenor, it reſembles
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0666900500:29"/>
a landſcape deprived of its intermediate part; without its treble, it is analagous to a landſcape deprived of its diſtance, or off-ſkip. We know how imperfect a picture is, when deprived of any of theſe parts; and hence we may form a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who determine on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of any muſical compoſition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing or hearing it in all its parts, and underſtanding their relation to each other.</p>
               <p>5<hi>thly,</hi> As in Painting, eſpecially in the nobler branches of it, and particularly in hiſtory-painting, there is a principal figure, which is moſt remarkable and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, and to which all the other figures are referred and ſubordinate; ſo, in the greater kinds of muſical compoſition, there is a principal or leading <hi>ſubject,</hi> or ſucceſſion of notes, which ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and be heard through the whole compoſition; and to which, both the air and harmony of the other parts ought to be in like manner referred and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0666900500:30"/>
6<hi>thly,</hi> So again, as in painting a groupe of figures, care is to be had, that there be no deficiency in it; but that a certain fulneſs or roundneſs be preſerved, ſuch as <hi>Titian</hi> beautifully compared to a bunch of grapes; ſo, in the nobler kinds of muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal compoſition, there are ſeveral inferior ſubjects, which depend on the principal: and here the ſeveral ſubjects (as in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the figures do) are, as it were, to <hi>ſuſtain</hi> and <hi>ſupport</hi> each other: and it is certain, that if any one of theſe be taken away from a ſkillful compoſition, there will be found a deficiency highly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to an experienced ear. Yet this does not hinder but there may be perfect compoſition in two, three, four, or more parts, in the ſame manner as a groupe may be perfect, though conſiſting of a ſmaller or greater number of figures. In both caſes, the painter or muſician varies his diſpoſition according to the number of parts, or figures, which he includes in his plan.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0666900500:31"/>
7<hi>thly,</hi> As in viewing a picture, you ought to be removed to a certain diſtance, called the point of ſight, at which all its parts are ſeen in their juſt proportions; ſo, in a concert, there is a certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, at which the ſounds are melted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to each other, and the various parts ſtrike the ear in their proper ſtrength and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry. To ſtand cloſe by a baſſoon, or double-baſs, when you hear a concert, is juſt as if you ſhould plant your eye cloſe to the fore-ground when you view a picture; or as if, in ſurveying a ſpacious edifice, you ſhould place yourſelf at the foot of a pillar that ſupports it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The various <hi>ſtyles</hi> in Painting—the grand—the terrible—the graceful—the tender—the paſſionate—the joyous—have all their reſpective analogies in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic.—And we may add, in conſequence of this, that as the manner of handling differs in Painting, according as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject varies; ſo, in Muſic, there are various inſtruments ſuited to the different kinds of muſical compoſitions, and particularly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0666900500:32"/>
adapted to, and expreſſive of, its ſeveral varieties. Thus, as the rough handling is proper for battles, ſieges, and whatever is great or terrible; and, on the contrary, the ſofter handling, and more finiſhed touches, are expreſſive of love, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or beauty: ſo, in Muſic, the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, horn, or kettle-drum, are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly employed on the firſt of theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the lute or harp on the laſt. There is a ſhort ſtory in the TATLER<note n="e" place="bottom">N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 153.</note>, which illuſtrates this analogy very prettily. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral eminent painters are there repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in picture as muſicians, with thoſe inſtruments in their hands which moſt aptly repreſent their reſpective manner in Painting.</p>

               <p>THESE obſervations being premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for the ſake of thoſe who are not particularly converſant in the theory of Muſic; let us now proceed to conſider this art with regard to its compoſition.</p>
               <p>We have already obſerved, that there are, properly ſpeaking, but three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, on which the worth of any mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical compoſition can depend. Theſe are <hi>melody, harmony,</hi> and <hi>expreſſion.</hi> When theſe three are united in their full excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the compoſition is then perfect: if any of theſe are wanting or imperfect, the compoſition is proportionably defective. The chief endeavour, therefore, of the ſkillful compoſer, muſt be <q rend="inline">"to unite all theſe various ſources of beauty in every
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0666900500:34"/>
piece; and never ſo far regard or idolize any one of them, as to deſpiſe and omit the other two."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Several examples will hereafter be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of conſiderable maſters, who, through an exceſſive fondneſs for one of theſe, have ſacrificed the reſt, and have thus fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſhort of that perfection and variety, which a correct ear demands.</p>
               <p>The firſt error we ſhall note is, where the harmony, and conſequently the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, is neglected for the ſake of air, or rather an extravagant modulation.</p>
               <p>The preſent faſhionable extreme of running all our muſic into one ſingle part, to the utter neglect of all true harmony, is a defect much more eſſential than the neglect of modulation only; inaſmuch as harmony is the very cement of all muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal compoſition.</p>
               <p>As in the work of harmony chiefly, the various contrivances of a good compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition are laid out and diſtinguiſhed, which, with a full and perfect execution in all the parts, produce thoſe noble effects we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0666900500:35"/>
often find in grand performances: ſo we may conſider the improvement of <hi>air,</hi> as the buſineſs of invention and taſte.</p>
               <p>But, if we may judge from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral turn of our modern Muſic (I ſpeak not of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only), this due regard, as well to a natural ſucceſſion of melodies, as to their harmonious accompanyments, ſeems generally neglected or forgotten. Hence that deluge of unbounded <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaganzi,</hi> which the unſkillful call inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which are merely calculated to ſhew an execution, without either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety or grace.</p>
               <p>In theſe vague and unmeaning pieces, we often find the bewildered compoſer, either ſtruggling with the difficulties of an extraneous modulation, or tiring the moſt conſummate patience with a tedious repetition of ſome jejune thought, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining he can never do enough, till he has run through every <hi>key</hi> that can be crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one <hi>movement;</hi> till, at length, all his force being exhauſted, he drops into a dull <hi>cloſe;</hi> where his languid piece ſeems
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0666900500:36"/>
rather to expire and yield its laſt, than conclude with a ſpirited and well-timed <hi>cadence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe kinds of compoſitions are greatly defective alſo in point of harmony, and chiefly in the baſs, which is often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently airy, or, at beſt, incapable of giving either ſpirit or fullneſs to the treble; in both caſes the compoſer not allotting to the baſs, the only part which it ought to bear in the whole conſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> the foundation of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>A muſical compoſition, in this light, may not unaptly be compared to the elevation of a building, where it is eaſy to diſcern what are the proportions and ornaments ſuitable to each degree, or aſcent, in the elevation: and where the moſt common obſerver would laugh at ſeeing their order inverted, and the heavy and plain <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> cruſhing down the light and delicate <hi>Ionic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they ſtrive, rather to ſurprize, than pleaſe the hearer: and, as it is eaſier to diſcern what is excellent in the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0666900500:37"/>
than <hi>compoſition</hi> of Muſic; ſo we may account, why many have been more induſtrious to improve and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves in the <hi>practice,</hi> than the <hi>ſtudy</hi> of this ſcience.</p>
               <p>To this ſilly vanity we may attribute that ſtrange attachment to certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning compoſitions, which many of our fluent performers have profeſſed; their chief ambition being to diſcover a <hi>ſwift,</hi> rather than a <hi>judicious</hi> or <hi>graceful</hi> hand. That performers of this taſte have ſo much in their power, is, at once, the misfortune and diſgrace of Muſic: for, whatever merit a compoſition may have in other reſpects, yet if, from a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the conſtruction of the harmony and fugues, all the parts be put upon a level, and, by that means, their ſupreme pride and pleaſure of a <hi>tedious ſolo</hi> be not admitted, it is with them a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of condemning the whole.</p>
               <p>The generality of our muſical virtuoſi are too eaſily led by the opinions of ſuch maſters; and, where there is no real diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0666900500:38"/>
prejudice and affectation will ſoon aſſume the place of reaſon. Thus, through the inordinate vanity of a few leading performers, a diſproportionate fame hath been the lot of ſome very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different compoſers, while others, with real merit, have been almoſt totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
               <p>It may be worth conſidering, from whence this falſe taſte hath had its riſe. And 1<hi>ſt,</hi> it may, perhaps, be affirmed with truth, that the falſe taſte, or rather the total want of taſte, in thoſe who hear, and who always aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the privilege of <hi>judging,</hi> hath often produced this low ſpecies of Muſic: for it muſt be owned, that this kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is apt, above all others, at firſt hearing, to ſtrike an unſkillful ear; and hence the maſters have often ſacrificed their art to the groſs judgement of an indelicate audience.</p>
               <p>But 2<hi>dly,</hi> It hath often had its riſe from the compoſer's beſtowing his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and attention on ſome trifling and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0666900500:39"/>
unfruitful ſubject, which can never allow of an eaſy and natural harmony to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it. For, however pleaſing it may ſeem in its air, yet if it is not capable of admitting alſo a pleaſing accompanyment, it were much better laid aſide, than car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into execution. On this account it is, that many fugues are unſufferably te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious: their barren ſubjects affording no variety in themſelves, are therefore often repeated entire; or tranſpoſed, or turned topſey-turvey, inſomuch that little elſe is heard throughout the whole piece<note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <p>I know it is a received opinion among the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeurs</hi> in Muſic, that the beſt <hi>ſubjects</hi> for <hi>fugues,</hi> or <hi>airs,</hi> are pretty much exhauſted; and, perhaps, their obſervation may be right: nevertheleſs, the ſkillful compoſer will ſo artfully vary and conduct them, that they will ſeem not only natural, but alſo new.</p>
                     <p>This may be ſeen by certain particular favourite paſſages, that are to be found in almoſt all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of our greateſt maſters.</p>
                     <p>I would not be underſtood to mean here, thoſe ſlaviſh imitations of whole movements together, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of many of CORELLI's, which ſhew their compoſers ſo deſtitute of all invention, or contrivance, as not to ſtrike out one thought or device, that can juſtly be called original.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0666900500:40"/>
3<hi>dly,</hi> Another ſource, and, perhaps, the moſt general, is that low idea of compoſition, wherein the ſubject, or air, is no ſooner led off, than it is immediately deſerted, for the ſake of ſome ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected flights, which have neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with each other, nor the leaſt tendency to any deſign whatever. This kind of random work is admirably cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for thoſe who <hi>compoſe</hi> without <hi>abilities,</hi> or <hi>hear</hi> without <hi>diſcernment;</hi> and therefore we need not wonder, that ſo large a ſhare of the Muſic that hath of late appeared, ſhould fall under this deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>How different from the conduct of theſe ſuperficial adventurers in Muſic, is that of the able and experienced com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer; who, when he hath exerted his fancy on any favourite ſubject, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his ſketch, till at his leiſure, and when his judgement is free, he can again and again correct, diminiſh, or enlarge his plan; ſo that the whole may appear,

               <p>Many extempore thoughts, thrown out in the fire and ſtrength of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have ſtood this critical review, and filled the happy author with uncommon tranſport. It is then he gains freſh vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and renews his toil, to range and harmonize the various melodies of his piece<note n="h" place="bottom">CORELLI employed the greateſt part of his life in reviſing and correcting his works, which the many grand and beautiful contrivances in his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony may ſufficiently evince.</note>.</p>
               <p>It may be proper now to mention, by way of example on this head, the moſt noted compoſers who have erred in the extreme of an unnatural modulation; leaving thoſe of ſtill inferior genius, to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0666900500:42"/>
that oblivion to which they are deſervedly deſtined.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt and loweſt claſs are, VI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VALDI, TESSARINI, ALBERTI, and LOC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATELLI, whoſe compoſitions, being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defective in various harmony, and true invention, are only a fit amuſement for children; nor indeed for theſe, if ever they are intended to be led to a juſt taſte in Muſic.</p>
               <p>Under the ſecond claſs, and riſing above theſe laſt mentioned in dignity, as they pay ſomewhat more of regard to the principles of harmony, may be ranked ſeveral of our modern compoſers for the <hi>Opera.</hi> Such are HASSE, PORPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA, TERRADELLAS, and LAMPUGNIANI. Though I muſt take the liberty to ſay, that beſides their too little regard to the principles of true harmony, they are often defective in one ſenſe, even with regard to air; I mean, by an endleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of their <hi>ſubject,</hi> by wearing it to rags, and tiring the hearer's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0666900500:43"/>
Of the third and higheſt claſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, who have run into this extreme of modulation, are VINCI, BONONCINI, AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORGO, and PERGOLESE. The frequent Delicacy of whoſe airs, is ſo ſtriking, that we almoſt forget the defect of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, under which they often labour. Their faults are loſt amidſt their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies; and the critic of taſte is almoſt tempted to blame his own ſeverity, in cenſuring compoſitions, in which he finds charms ſo powerful and commanding.</p>
               <p>However, for the ſake of truth, it muſt be added, that this taſte, even in its moſt pardonable degree, ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, becauſe it ſeems naturally to lead to the ruin of a noble art. We need only compare the preſent with paſt ages, and we ſhall ſee a like cataſtrophe in the art of painting. <q rend="inline">"For (as an ingenious writer very juſtly remarks) while the maſters in this fine art confined the pencil to the genuine forms of grace and greatneſs, and only ſuperadded to theſe, the temperate embelliſhments of

a chaſtiſed and modeſt colouring, the art grew towards its perfection: but no ſooner was their attention turned from <hi>truth, ſimplicity,</hi> and <hi>deſign,</hi> than their credit declined with their art; and the experienced eye, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates the old pictures with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſurveys the <hi>modern</hi> with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or contempt<note n="i" place="bottom">

                  <note n="k" place="bottom">Painting was arrived at the ſummit of perfection, when Muſic was far behind, and but ſlowly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, though greatly encouraged and admired. The works of PALESTINA in that infant-ſtate of Muſic, may be conſidered as the firſt lights of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: while thoſe of RAPHAEL, his contemporary and fellow-citizen, not only excelled the ſeveral emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent maſters that went before him, but to this day remain unequalled.

               <p>HAVING noted the reigning defect of the modern compoſers, ariſing from their ſuperficial uſe of modulation, to the utter neglect of all true harmony the next thing that offers itſelf, is the very reverſe of this. I mean, the too ſevere attachment of the Ancients<note n="l" place="bottom">By the Ancients are meant, thoſe who lived from the time of PALESTINA to the introduction of modern operas.</note> to harmony, and the neglect of modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The old maſters, in general, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a great depth of knowledge in the conſtruction of their harmony. Their ſubjects are invented, and carried on with wonderful art; to which they often add a conſiderable energy and force of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: yet, we muſt own, that with regard to <hi>air</hi> or modulation, they are often defective. Our old cathedral mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0666900500:46"/>
is a ſufficient proof of this: here we generally find the more ſtriking beauties of air or modulation, give way to a dry rule of counterpoint: many an elaborate piece, by this means, inſtead of being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, becomes formal; and while our thoughts, by a <hi>natural</hi> and pleaſing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody, ſhould be elevated to the proper objects of our devotion, we are only ſtruck with an idea of ſome <hi>artificial</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in the harmony.</p>
               <p>Thus the old Muſic was often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to diſcover the compoſer's <hi>art,</hi> as the modern is generally calculated to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the performer's <hi>dexterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The learned <hi>contrapuntiſt</hi> may exerciſe his talent in many wonderful contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, as in <hi>fugues</hi> and <hi>canons</hi> of various <hi>ſubjects</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> &amp;c. But, where the maſter is thus ſeverely intent in ſhewing his art, he may, indeed, amuſe the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> and amaze the <hi>eye,</hi> but can never touch the <hi>heart,</hi> or delight the <hi>ear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have often thought that the ſtate of Muſic, at different times, might, very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0666900500:47"/>
appoſitely, be compared to the ſeries of alterations in the art of building. We cannot, indeed, with the ſame certainty and preciſion, determine what may have been the perfection of Muſic, in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtate, among the Ancients: yet, the ſhort analogy which follows, may ſerve to evince, that both theſe arts have varied according to the taſte of particular ages.</p>
               <p>It is well known, that in old <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> architecture was in its higheſt perfection; and that, after their ſeveral empires were overthrown, theſe glorious monuments of their taſte and genius were almoſt entirely deſtroyed. To theſe ſucceeded a ſtrange mixture of the <hi>antique</hi> and <hi>barbarous</hi> Guſto, which has ſince been diſtinguiſhed by the name of Gothic. In theſe latter ages this art has gradually returned to its former ſtate; and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reliſh of the grand, the ſimple, and convenient is revived.</p>
               <p>And thus we may diſtinguiſh the three great <hi>aeras</hi> of Muſic.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0666900500:48"/>
Amongſt the Ancients, the true ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of <hi>melody,</hi> with, perhaps, ſome mixture of plain unperplexed <hi>harmony,</hi> ſeems to have been that <hi>magic ſpell,</hi> which ſo powerfully inchanted every hearer.</p>
               <p>At the revival of this art in the time of Pope GREGORY, a new ſyſtem, and new laws of harmony were invented, and afterwards enlarged by GUIDO ARE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINO: but this ſerved only to lead the plodding geniuſes of thoſe times (and ſince, their rigid followers) to incumber the art with a <hi>confuſion of parts,</hi> which, like the numerous and trifling ornaments in the <hi>Gothic architecture,</hi> was productive of no other pleaſure, than that of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the patience and minuteneſs of the artiſt, and which, like <hi>that</hi> too, by men of taſte, hath long been exploded<note n="m" place="bottom">In the reign of queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> I, the muſicians were famous for compoſing leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At preſent our taſte is greatly more diverſified, more ſubjected to the genius
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0666900500:49"/>
and language of particular countries, and leſs confined by thoſe rigorous laws; the leaſt deviation from which, was formerly thought an unpardonable offence; as if thoſe laws were intended to fix the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of genius, and prevent the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of ſcience.</p>
               <p>But, as we have ſaid, the art (though ſtill fluctuating) has now gained much freedom and enlargement, from theſe minute and ſevere laws, and is returning nearer to its ancient ſimplicity. The moſt eminent compoſers of late years, have not ſhewn any great fondneſs for a multiplicity of parts, which rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy than aſſiſt the force and efficacy of Muſic: neither have they deprived the charms of <hi>melody</hi> of their peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, by ſtunning the ear with an <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> too intricate and multifarious. And, I believe, upon a general ſurvey of the particular genius of different maſters, we ſhall find, that thoſe who have the leaſt of <hi>nature</hi> in their compoſitions, have generally endeavoured to ſupply the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0666900500:50"/>
want of it, by the ſeverer application of <hi>art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, I would by no means be thought to include all the old maſters in this cenſure: ſome of them have carried mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical compoſition to that height of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that we need think it no diſgrace to form our taſte of <hi>counterpoint</hi> on the valuable plans they have left us. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of theſe indeed have fallen, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, into oblivion; ſuch, I mean, who had only the cold aſſiſtance of art, and were deſtitute of genius. But there are others of this claſs, who, although the early period in which they wrote, naturally expoſed them to the defect here noted; yet the force of their genius, and the wonderful conſtruction of their fugues and harmony, hath excited the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſucceeding ages. And here we ſhall find, that the compoſers of this claſs will naturally fall into three different ranks, in the ſame manner as thoſe we have already ventured to characterize in the preceding ſection.</p>

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0666900500:51"/>
Among theſe, PALESTINA, the firſt, not only in point of time<note n="n" place="bottom">PALESTINA lived at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of LEO the Tenth; the period at which all arts revived.</note>, but of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius too, deſerves the high title of <hi>father of harmony.</hi> And the ſtyle of our great old maſter TALLIS<note n="o" place="bottom">TALLIS was chapel-maſter in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time.</note>, evidently ſhews he had ſtudied the works of this great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, who lived to ſee his own ſyſtem of harmony take root, and flouriſh in many parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> but more eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> where he was immediately ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral eminent maſters, among whom, perhaps, ALLEGRI may be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chief; whoſe compoſitions, with thoſe of PALESTINA, are ſtill performed in the Pope's chapel, and other choirs abroad: in all theſe maſters we ſee the ſame grand conſtruction of parts, and a parallel <hi>defect</hi> of <hi>modulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After theſe we may rank CARISSIMI, STRADELLA<note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <p>STRADELLA is ſuppoſed to have been one of the firſt compoſers who introduced the recitative into vocal compoſitions.

It is certain, however, this excellent maſter was poſſeſſed of all thoſe qualities that are requiſite to form a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer; and, we may venture to ſay, had the genius of PURCEL been aſſiſted with ſuch an intercourſe, as we have had ſince his time, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In his airs there is a mixture of harmony and fancy, that ſets him far above the reſt of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. In fine, what COWLEY and WALLER united, may be eſteemed among the poets; ſuch may PURCEL be thought among the muſicians.</p>

of a much later date, indeed, and who lived alſo at different times: yet their works, though, in general, of the ſame character with thoſe of PALESTINA, are not, perhaps, of ſo high a claſs in one reſpect, nor ſo low in another. I mean, that although their character is that of <hi>excellence in harmony</hi> and <hi>defect in air;</hi> yet they are not ſo excellent in the former, nor ſo defective in the latter, as the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable PALESTINA.</p>
               <p>From the time of theſe maſters to the preſent, there has been a ſucceſſion of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0666900500:53"/>
many excellent compoſers, who ſeeing the defects of thoſe who preceded them, in the too great neglect of <hi>air,</hi> have adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nobleſt harmonies by a ſuitable <hi>modulation:</hi> yet ſtill, ſo far retaining the ſtyle of the more ancient compoſitions, as to make the <hi>harmonic conſtruction</hi> the leading character of their works; while the circumſtance of modulation remains only as a <hi>ſecondary</hi> quality. Such are the chaſte and faultleſs CORELLI; the bold and inventive SCARLATTI<note n="q" place="bottom">DOMENICO SCARLATTI, author of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>leſſons</hi> for the <hi>harpſichord,</hi> and ſon to the SCARLATTI here mentioned, may juſtly be ranked among the great maſters of this age. The invention of his <hi>subjects</hi> or <hi>airs,</hi> and the beautiful chain of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation</hi> in all theſe <hi>pieces,</hi> are peculiarly his own: and though in many places, the fineſt <hi>paſſages</hi> are greatly diſguiſed with capricious <hi>diviſions,</hi> yet, upon the whole, they are original and maſterly.</note>; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime CALDARA; the graceful and ſpirited RAMEAU<note n="r" place="bottom">

                     <p>As in this ſpecies of compoſition, the undertaking is great and extenſive, ſo the compoſer's ſkill or ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility will, in proportion, be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is we are inſtantly charmed with the happy talent of RAMEAU. His <hi>choruſes, airs,</hi> and <hi>duetts,</hi> are finely adapted to the various ſubjects they are intended to expreſs. In the firſt, he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0666900500:54"/>
To theſe we may juſtly add our illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious HANDEL; in whoſe manly ſtyle we often find the nobleſt harmonies; and theſe enlivened with ſuch a variety of modulation, as could hardly have been expected from one who hath ſupplied the town with muſical entertainments of every kind, for thirty years together<note n="s" place="bottom">
                     <p>The celebrated LULLI of <hi>France,</hi> and the old SCARLATTI at <hi>Rome,</hi> may be conſidered in the ſame light with HANDEL. They were both volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous compoſers, and were not always equally happy in commanding their genius. Yet, upon the whole, they have been of infinite ſervice in the progreſs of Muſic: and if we take away from their numerous works, all that is indifferent, there will ſtill enough remain that is excellent, to give them a diſtinguiſhed rank.</p>
                     <p>It is pretty remarkable, that the three maſters here mentioned, have, perhaps, enjoyed the higheſt local reputation, having all been the reigning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites among the people, in the ſeveral countries where they reſided: and thence have been regarded as ſtanding models of perfection to many ſucceeding compoſers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> ſeem particularly indebted to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and invention of SCARLATTI; and <hi>France</hi> has produced a RAMEAU, equal, if not ſuperior to LULLI. The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as yet, indeed, have not been ſo ſucceſsful: but whether this may be owing to any inferiority in the original they have choſe to imitate, or to a want of genius in thoſe that are his imitators (in diſtinguiſhing, perhaps, not the moſt excellent of his works) it is not neceſſary here to determine.</p>

Theſe ſeem to be the principal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, worthy the attention of a muſical enquirer, who have regarded the <hi>harmonic ſyſtem</hi> and the conſtruction of fugues as the principal object of their care; while at the ſame time, they have regarded the circumſtance of modulation ſo far as to deſerve a very high degree of praiſe on this account, though not the higheſt.</p>

               <head>SECT. III. ON MUSICAL EXPRESSION, SO FAR AS IT RELATES TO THE COMPOSER.</head>
               <p>SO much concerning the two branches of muſic, <hi>air</hi> and <hi>harmony:</hi> let us now conſider the third circumſtance, which is <hi>expreſſion.</hi> This, as hath been already obſerved, <q rend="inline">"ariſes from a combination of the other two; and is no other than a ſtrong and proper application of them to the intended ſubject."</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this definition it will plainly appear, that air and harmony are never to be deſerted for the ſake of expreſſion: becauſe expreſſion is founded on them. And if we ſhould attempt any thing in defiance of theſe, it would ceaſe to be <hi>Muſical Expreſſion.</hi> Still leſs can the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid diſſonance of cat-calls deſerve this appellation, though the expreſſion or imitation be ever ſo ſtrong and natural.</p>
               <p>And, as diſſonance and ſhocking ſounds cannot be called Muſical Expreſſion;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0666900500:57"/>
ſo neither do I think, can mere imitation of ſeveral other things be entitled to this name, which, however, among the generality of mankind, hath often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it. Thus the gradual riſing or fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the notes in a long ſucceſſion, is often uſed to denote aſcent or deſcent; broken intervals, to denote an interrupted motion; a number of quick diviſions, to deſcribe ſwiftneſs or flying; ſounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling laughter, to deſcribe laughter; with a number of other contrivances of a parallel kind, which it is needleſs here to mention. Now all theſe I ſhould chuſe to ſtyle imitation, rather than expreſſion; becauſe it ſeems to me, that their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency is rather to fix the hearer's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſimilitude between the ſounds and the things which they deſcribe, and thereby to excite a reflex act of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, than to affect the heart and raiſe the paſſions of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Here then we ſee a defect or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, ſimilar to thoſe which have been above obſerved to ariſe from a too parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0666900500:58"/>
attachment either to the <hi>modulation</hi> or <hi>harmony.</hi> For as, in the firſt caſe, the maſter often attaches himſelf ſo ſtrongly to the beauty of <hi>air</hi> or modulation, as to neglect the <hi>harmony;</hi> and in the ſecond caſe, purſues his harmony or fugues ſo as to deſtroy the beauty of modulation; ſo in this third caſe, for the ſake of a forced, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning imitation, he neglects both air and harmony, on which alone true mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical expreſſion can be founded.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction ſeems more worthy our notice at preſent, becauſe ſome very eminent compoſers have attached them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves chiefly to the method here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and ſeem to think they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted all the depths of expreſſion, by a dextrous imitation of the meaning of a few particular words, that occur in the hymns or ſongs which they ſet to muſic. Thus, were one of theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to expreſs the following words of <hi>Milton,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0666900500:59"/>
                     <l>—Their ſongs</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Divide</hi> the night, and <hi>lift</hi> our thoughts to heav'n:</l>
                  </q>
It is highly probable, that upon the word <hi>divide,</hi> he would run a <hi>diviſion</hi> of half a dozen bars; and on the ſubſequent part of the ſentence, he would not think he had done the poet juſtice, or <hi>riſen</hi> to that <hi>height</hi> of ſublimity which he ought to expreſs, till he had climbed up to the very top of his inſtrument, or at leaſt as far as a human voice could follow him. And this would paſs with a great part of mankind for muſical expreſſion; inſtead of that noble mixture of ſolemn airs and various harmony, which <hi>indeed</hi> elevates our thoughts, and gives that exquiſite pleaſure, which none but true lovers of harmony can feel.</p>
               <p>Were it neceſſary, I might eaſily prove, upon general principles, that what I now advance concerning muſical imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtrictly juſt; both, becauſe Muſic as an imitative art has <hi>very confined powers,</hi> and becauſe, when it is an ally to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0666900500:60"/>
poetry (which it ought always to be when it exerts its mimetic faculty) it obtains its end <hi>by raiſing correſpondent affections</hi> in the ſoul with thoſe which ought to reſult from the genius of the poem. But this has been already ſhewn, by a judicious writer<note n="t" place="bottom">Vide three treatiſes of J. H. the ſecond concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poetry, painting, and muſic.</note>, with that preciſion and accuracy which diſtinguiſhes his writings. To his excellent treatiſe I ſhall, therefore, refer my reader, and content myſelf, in this place, with adding two or three practical obſervations by way of corollary to his theory.</p>

                  <hi>ſounds and motions,</hi> it ſeems reaſonable, that when <hi>ſounds</hi> only are the objects of imitation, the compoſer ought to throw the mimetic part entirely amongſt the accompanying <hi>inſtruments;</hi> becauſe it is probable, that the imitation will be too powerful in the <hi>voice</hi> which ought to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0666900500:61"/>

               <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> When Muſic imitates <hi>motions,</hi> the rythm, and caſt of the air, will generally require, that both the vocal and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental parts coincide in their imitation.

                        </q> Here the air and the ſymphony delightfully imitate the humming of the bees, the murmuring of the waters, and expreſs the ideas of quiet and ſlumber; but what, above all, demands this eulogium, is the maſter-ſtroke of accompanying the voice with trebles and tenors, only till he comes to theſe words,

               <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> As Muſic can only imitate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſounds, and the <hi>motions</hi> only imperfectly; it will follow, that muſical imitation ought never to be employed in repreſenting objects, of which motion or ſound are not the principal conſtituents. Thus, to light, or lightning, we annex the property of celerity of motion; yet it will not follow from thence, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſwift progreſſion of notes will raiſe the idea of either one or the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as we ſaid, the imitation muſt be, in theſe caſes, very partial<note n="e" place="bottom">What ſhall we ſay to excuſe this ſame great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, who, in his Oratorio of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> condeſcended to amuſe the vulgar part of his audience, by letting them <hi>hear the ſun ſtand ſtill?</hi>
                  </note>. Again, it is one property of froſt to make perſons ſhake and tremble; yet, a tremulous
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0666900500:66"/>
movement of ſemitones, will never give the true idea of froſt: though, perhaps, they may of a trembling perſon.</p>
               <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> As the aim of Muſic is to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the paſſions in a pleaſing manner, and as it uſes melody and harmony to obtain that end, its imitation muſt never be employed on <hi>ungraceful motions,</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable ſounds:</hi> becauſe, in the one caſe, it muſt injure the <hi>melody</hi> of the air; and in the other, the <hi>harmony</hi> of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyment; and, in both caſes, muſt loſe its intent of affecting the paſſions <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5<hi>thly,</hi> As imitation is only ſo far of uſe in Muſic, as when it aids the expreſſion; as it is only analogous to poetic imitation, <hi>when poetry imitates</hi> through mere natural media<note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>H's</hi> Treatiſes, p. 70.</note>, ſo it ſhould only be employed in the ſame manner. To make the ſound echo to the ſenſe in deſcriptive lyric, and, perhaps, in the cooler parts of epic poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is often a great beauty; but, ſhould the tragic poet labour at ſhewing this art
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0666900500:67"/>
in his moſt diſtreſsful ſpeeches; I ſuppoſe he would rather flatten than inſpirit his drama: in like manner, the muſical compoſer, who catches at every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <note n="g" place="bottom">To give but one inſtance, how many compoſers hath the ſingle epithet, WARELING, miſled from the true road of expreſſion, like an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired them in a <hi>pun?</hi>
                  </note>epithet or metaphor that the part affords him, to ſhew his imitative power, will never fail to hurt the true aim of his compoſition, and will always prove the more deficient in proportion as his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is more pathetic or ſublime.</p>
               <p>What then is the compoſer, who would aim at true muſical expreſſion, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? I anſwer, he is to blend ſuch an happy mixture of air and harmony, as will affect us moſt ſtrongly with the paſſions or affections which the poet intends to raiſe: and that, on this account, he is not principally to dwell on particular words in the way of imitation, but to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the poet's general drift or intention, and on this to form his airs and harmony,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0666900500:68"/>
either by imitation (ſo far as imitation may be proper to this end) or by any other means. But this I muſt ſtill add, that if he attempts to raiſe the paſſions by imitation, it muſt be ſuch a temperate and chaſtiſed imitation as rather brings the object before the hearer, than ſuch a one as induces him to form a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between the object and the ſound: for, in this laſt caſe, his attention will be turned entirely on the compoſer's art, which muſt effectually check the paſſion. The power of Muſic is, in this reſpect, parallel to the power of Eloquence: if it works at all, it muſt work in a ſecret and unſuſpected manner. In either caſe, a pompous diſplay of art will deſtroy its own intentions: on which account, one of the beſt general rules, perhaps, that can be given for muſical expreſſion, is that which gives riſe to the pathetic in every other art, <hi>an unaffected ſtrain of nature and ſimplicity</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <p>Whatever the ſtate of muſic may have been among the ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> &amp;c. or whether it was actually capable of producing thoſe wonderful effects related of it, we cannot abſolutely determine; ſeeing all the uſes of their <hi>enharmonic ſcale</hi> are totally loſt; and of their muſical characters, which ſhould have conveyed to us their art, ſlender traces any where to be found. From the ſtructure of their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we cannot form any vaſt ideas of their powers: <note n="*" place="bottom">CALMET's Diſſertation ſur la Muſique des Anciens.</note> they ſeem to have been far inferior to thoſe in uſe at preſent: but which, indeed, being capable of as much execution as expreſſion, are only rendered more liable to be abuſed. Thus, the too great compaſs of our modern inſtruments, tempting as well the compoſer as performer, to exceed the natural bounds of harmony, may be one reaſon why ſome authors have ſo warmly eſpouſed the cauſe of the ancient Muſic, and run down that of the modern<note n="†" place="bottom">Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE's Works, 1ſt vol. fol. p. 162.</note>.</p>
                     <p>I believe we may juſtly conclude, that the force and beauties of the ancient Muſic did not conſiſt ſo much in artful compoſitions, or in any ſuperiority of execution in the performance: as in the pure ſimplicity of its melody; which being performed in uniſons, by their vaſt choruſes of voices and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, no wonder the moſt prodigious effects were produced<note n="‡" place="bottom">BONET, Hiſtoire de la Muſique.</note>. Since the time of GUIDO ARE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINO<note n="§" place="bottom">ARETINO lived in the eleventh century.</note>, the laws and principles of harmony have been conſiderably enlarged, and, by rendering this art more intricate and complex, have deprived it of thoſe plain, though ſtriking beauties, which, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, almoſt every hearer could diſtinguiſh and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire. And I don't know whether this will not go ſome way, towards determining the diſpute concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuperior excellency of ancient and modern Muſic. It is to be obſerved, that the Ancients, when they ſpeak of its marvellous effects, generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as an adjunct to poetry. Now an art, in its progreſs to its own abſolute perfection, may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at ſome intermediate point; which is its point of perfection, conſidered as an art joined to another art; but not to its own, when taken ſeparately. If the Ancients, therefore, carried melody to its higheſt perfection, it is probable they puſhed the muſical art as far as it would go, conſidered as an adjunct to poetry: but harmony is the perfection of Muſic, as a ſingle ſcience. Hence then we may determine the ſpecific difference between the ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern compoſitions, and conſequently their excellency.</p>

There is no doubt but many rules may be deduced, both from the compoſitions

of the beſt maſters, and from experience, in obſerving the effects which various ſounds have upon the imagination and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.

the ſequel of theſe, to one or two <hi>keys,</hi> at moſt, produces but an irkſome mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony of ſounds: for it is not ſufficient, that different movements are of different ſpecies; their changes ſhould alſo appear, as well in their <hi>keys,</hi> as in their <hi>air:</hi> and the compoſer of taſte will ſhew his art in the arrangement of theſe <hi>different pieces,</hi> as well as in his variety of modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or other contrivances, in the <hi>ſame piece</hi>

                     <p>Such are the beautiful <hi>cantatas</hi> of BATTISTA PERGOLESE, printed at <hi>Naples</hi> in the year 1738. They are, perhaps, the moſt elegant performances, in this ſpecies of compoſition, that have yet appeared.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>cantatas</hi> of GIOVANNI BONONCINI, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in <hi>London,</hi> by ſubſcription, above thirty years ago, are alſo very fine, and may ſtill be called modern: though many performers, who hear and ſee no farther than the moſt periſhable part of a compoſition, have given them up to an exploded taſte: nevertheleſs, I ſhall venture to ſay, that the <hi>airs</hi> of BONONCINI are natural, and the <hi>accompanied recitative</hi> maſterly, and finely imagined in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion to the <hi>tempo-giuſto,</hi> or regular movement. I don't know any method of accompanyment with the voice, more delicate and affecting than this, in which the <hi>Italians,</hi> eſpecially the two great maſters here noted, are peculiarly happy.</p>
                     <p>PORPORA's <hi>cantatas</hi> deſerve alſo a particular mention in this place. The moſt agreeable changes in modulation, from one movement to another, may be found in many of theſe, his maſter-pieces. The <hi>adagios</hi> are generally, indeed, too much lengthened; by which means, they are rather tedious when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated from the <hi>Da Capo:</hi> and, notwithſtanding I have thought the ſubjects in them pleaſing, and have heard them very finely performed; yet could I never be convinced, that their author had learned the art of knowing when he had done enough.</p>

And, as <hi>diſcords,</hi> when judiciouſly managed, give their ſucceeding <hi>concords</hi> a yet more pleaſing harmony; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſome happy contrivance in changing the key of ſeparate movements, whether from <hi>flat</hi> to <hi>ſharp,</hi> or <hi>vice verſa,</hi> will ſtill, in a higher degree, afford relief and pleaſure to the hearer: many alterations of this kind may ſurely be affected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt diſagreeable ſurprize; ſince we are not always delighted when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation follows, as we naturally expect it, nor always ſhocked when <hi>that</hi> expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is diſappointed.</p>

and which, perhaps, equally to the moſt ſtriking <hi>air,</hi> commands the admiration of many lovers of Muſic, who yet can no otherwiſe account for the preference they may give to a fine compoſition, than purely from the pleaſure it affords them. In fine, it is this maſterly taſte and method of ranging, in beautiful order, the diſtinguiſhed parts of a compoſition, which gives the higheſt delight to thoſe who can enter into the real merits of this art:—a circumſtance, the muſical ſtudent would do well to conſider, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages in any trial of his talent that way. But, as example is of much greater force than any rule or precept whatever; I would recommend to him, a conſtant peruſal of the beſt compoſitions in <hi>ſcore,</hi> where he will find all the information he can deſire on this head<note n="m" place="bottom">The muſical ſtudent being here ſuppoſed to have ſome previous knowledge in the rudiments of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it might not be amiſs, before he attempts the more finiſhed parts, to take a particular ſurvey of RAMEAU's <hi>Principles of Compoſition,</hi> now tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for, however prevailing a good ear may be found in the practice of compoſition, yet the rules of this art, as in all other arts, are founded in nature, and, therefore, muſt afford great aſſiſtance, even to thoſe who may think but ſlightly of them. As the works of art without genius, though maſterly, and ſtudied in their conſtruction, are often defective of ſpirit and taſte; ſo are thoſe of genius without art, very far from perfection: but when theſe are united, when the powers of nature, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches of art, are fully exerted, it is then only we may expect the nobleſt productions.</note>.</p>

After all that has been, or can be ſaid, the energy and grace of <hi>muſical expreſſion</hi> is of too delicate a nature to be fixed by words: it is a matter of taſte, rather than of reaſoning, and is, therefore, much better underſtood by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample than by precept. It is in the works of the great maſters, that we muſt look for the rules and full union of <hi>air, harmony,</hi> and <hi>expreſſion.</hi> Would modern compoſers condeſcend to repair to theſe fountains of knowledge, the public ear would neither be offended nor miſled by thoſe ſhallow and unconnected compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have of late ſo much abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially thoſe inſipid efforts that are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0666900500:79"/>
daily made to ſet to Muſic that flood of nonſenſe which is let in upon us ſince the commencement of our ſummer enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and which, in the manner they are conducted, cannot poſſibly prove of any advantage to Muſic: trifling eſſays in poetry muſt depreſs, inſtead of raiſing, the genius of the compoſer; who vainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, inſtead of giving aid to ſenſe (Muſic's noble prerogative), to harmonize nonſenſe, and make dulneſs pleaſing.</p>
               <p>Thus, it fares with Muſic, as it fares with her ſiſter Poetry; for it muſt be owned, that the compoſitions laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are generally upon a level with the words they are ſet to: their fate too is generally the ſame; theſe <hi>inſect</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions ſeldom out-living the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> that gives them birth.</p>
               <p>It has been juſtly enough alledged<note n="n" place="bottom">TOSI on the florid Song, p. 91.</note>, with regard to the <hi>Italian</hi> operas, that there are alſo many improprieties in theſe, which offend even the moſt common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0666900500:80"/>
particularly that egregious abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of repeating, and finiſhing many ſongs with the firſt part; when it often happens, after the paſſions of anger and revenge have been ſufficiently expreſſed, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement and love are the ſubjects of the ſecond, and, therefore, ſhould conclude the performance. But, as if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to leave the mind in this tranquil ſtate, the performer, or actor, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into all that tempeſt and fury with which he began, and leave his hearers in the midſt of it.</p>
               <p>I have juſt hinted this unaccountable conduct of the <hi>Italian</hi> compoſers, by way of contraſt to a conduct as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ridiculous in our own; I mean, our manner of ſetting one ſingle trifling air, repeated to many verſes, and all of them, perhaps, expreſſive of very different ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents or affections; than which, a greater abſurdity cannot poſſibly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, in the conſtruction of any muſical compoſition whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0666900500:81"/>
What may farther be obſerved in the compoſition of theſe little airs, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral method of repeating the ſame thought in the <hi>Ritornello,</hi> which is heard in the ſong. By this means, the burthen of the tune, be it ever ſo common, muſt inceſſantly jingle in the ear, and produce nothing but ſome wretched alternations between the inſtrument and voice.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, if the ſubject of the ſong was relieved by different paſſages in the inſtrumental part, but of a ſimilar air with the vocal; this kind of variety might ſupport the repetition of the whole, with ſomewhat more ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Among the many excellent ballads which our language affords, I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that of <hi>Black-ey'd Suſan,</hi> wrote by Mr GAY; and propoſe it as a ſpecimen, to ſhew by what methods a compoſer might handle this genus of the lyric poem: and which, indeed, is no other than to treat them, as the <hi>Italians</hi> have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally managed thoſe little love-ſtories which are the ſubject of their <hi>ſerenatas:</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0666900500:82"/>
—a kind of muſical production, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely elegant, and proper for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Therefore, I would recommend to our vocal compoſers, ſome ſuch method of ſetting to muſic the beſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſongs, and which, in like manner, will admit of various <hi>airs</hi> and <hi>duetts,</hi> with their <hi>reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,</hi> or muſical narratives, properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed, to relieve and embelliſh the whole.</p>
               <p>Thus one good ballad may ſupply a fruitful genius with a variety of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, wherein he will have ſufficient ſcope to diſplay his imagination, and to ſhew a judgement and contrivance in adapting his ſeveral airs to the different ſubjects of the poetry. By this means, not only a genteel and conſiſtent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance might be produced, but alſo fewer good maſters would laviſh their muſical thoughts on ſubjects ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them: nor, on this account, would there be any dearth of thoſe agreeable and familiar airs, which might properly be calculated for thoſe entertainments, where
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0666900500:83"/>
the public ear ſhould be always conſulted; and of which I have ſo good an opinion, that, were this difference between a juſt or falſe taſte but fairly ſubmitted to its deciſion, I ſhould not diſpute, but the compoſition which was moſt natural and pleaſing, would bid faireſt for the general approbation.</p>
               <p>Yet, ſo long as our compoſers proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their ſtudies without the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any works but ſuch as are on a level with their own, they muſt never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to advance in the eſteem of their judges. For, as the ſtriking beauties in a fine compoſition, elevate and enliven the fancy; ſo is it depreſſed and vitiated by too great a familiarity with whatever is mean and trifling.</p>
               <p>He, therefore, that is bleſſed with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py talents for this art, let him ſhun all the means of catching the common air, which ſo ſtrangely infects and poſſeſſes too many compoſers; but, unleſs he has the virtue of the <hi>bee,</hi> who,
<q>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0666900500:84"/>
                     <l>"—With taſte ſo ſubtly true,</l>
                     <l>"From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew;"</l>
                  </q>
I fear, he muſt baniſh himſelf from almoſt every place of public reſort, and fly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to monaſteries and cells, where the genuine charms of harmony may often, indeed, be found, for ſtores to grace his future productions.</p>
               <p>Our church muſic is equally capable of improvements from the ſame ſources of taſte and knowledge. We ſeem, at preſent, almoſt to have forgot, that devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the original and proper end of it. Hence that ill-timed levity of air in our modern anthems, that fooliſh pride of execution in our voluntaries, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts every rational hearer, and diſſipates, inſtead of heightening, true devotion.</p>
               <p>If our organiſt is a lover of poetry, without which, we may diſpute his love for Muſic; or indeed, if he has any well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directed paſſions at all; he cannot but feel ſome elevation of mind, when he hears the pſalm preceding his voluntary, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0666900500:85"/>
in an awful and pathetic ſtrain: it is then he muſt join <hi>his</hi> part, and with ſome ſolemn air, relieve, with religious chearfulneſs, the calm and well-diſpoſed heart. Yet, if he feels not this divine energy in his own breaſt, it will prove but a fruitleſs attempt to raiſe it in that of others: nor can he hope to throw out thoſe happy inſtantaneous thoughts, which ſometimes far exceed the beſt-concerted compoſitions, and which the enraptured performer would often gladly ſecure to his future uſe and pleaſure, did they not as fleetly eſcape as they ariſe. He ſhould alſo be extremely cautious of imitating common ſongs or airs, in the ſubjects of this latter kind of performance; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he will but too much expoſe religion to contempt and ridicule.</p>
               <p>It may not derogate from our ſubject of church-muſic, juſt to mention the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent method of ſinging the common pſalm tunes in the parochial ſervice, which are every where ſung without the leaſt regard to <hi>time</hi> or <hi>meaſure,</hi> by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0666900500:86"/>
drawling out every note to an unlimited length. It is evident, that both the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>proper tunes</hi> were originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſung in the <hi>alla-breve</hi> time, or the regular pointing of two, three, or four <hi>minims</hi> in a <hi>bar:</hi>—a kind of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which every ear, with the leaſt practice, may eaſily attain: nor when they are ſung in parts, ſhould there be any more than three, <hi>i. e.</hi> one treble, tenor, and baſs; as too complex an <hi>harmony</hi> would deſtroy their natural <hi>air.</hi> And, in this ſtyle, our pſalm tunes are capable of all the ſolemnity that can be required from ſuch plain and unadorned harmony<note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <p>The pious and ingenious Dr. WATTS, in his preface to his tranſlation of the Pſalms, very juſtly laments this miſerable drawling out the Pſalm.

Whoever has heard the Proteſtant congregations abroad ſing, in parts, their pſalms or hymns, may recollect, with ſome pleaſure, that part of their religious worſhip; and their exceeding us ſo far in a performance of this kind, is chiefly owing to the exact <hi>meaſure</hi> in which thoſe tunes are ſung, and not to their <hi>harmony:</hi> for the greateſt part of our own, which were compoſed ſoon after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, by thoſe excellent maſters we had at that time, would doubtleſs be found, as well in regard to their ſolemn <hi>air,</hi> as <hi>harmony,</hi> equal, if not ſuperior, to any compoſitions of their kind. And we may further obſerve, that <hi>air</hi> is, in a higher degree, productive of both ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and chearfulneſs, than <hi>harmony:</hi> for there is a dignity and grace in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0666900500:88"/>
former, when invented by genius, which a maſterly harmony may indeed aſſiſt, but can never produce.</p>
               <p>However trifling it may appear to conſider this ſpecies of Muſic, I cannot but own, that I have been uncommonly affected with hearing ſome thouſands of voices hymning the Deity in a ſtyle of harmony adapted to that awful occaſion. But ſorry I am to obſerve, that the chief performer, in this kind of noble chorus, is too often ſo fond of his own conceits; that, with his abſurd graces, and tedious and ill-connected interludes, he miſleads or confounds his congregation, inſtead of being the rational guide and director of the whole.</p>
               <p>It may be thought, perhaps, by thus depriving our organiſt of this public op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhewing his dexterity, both in his voluntary and pſalm tune, that all performers indiſcriminately might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing the duty here required: but it will be found no ſuch eaſy matter to ſtrike out the true ſublimity of ſtyle,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0666900500:89"/>
which is proper to be heard, when the mind is in a devout ſtate; or, when we would be greatly ſolemn, to avoid the heavy and ſpiritleſs manner, which, inſtead of calmly relieving and lifting up the heart, rather ſinks it into a ſtate of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>We might ſoon arrive at a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtyle and manner, as well in our compoſitions as performance; did we but ſtudy the works of the beſt chapel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters abroad, as CALDARA, LOTTI, GASPARINI, and many others, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent compoſitions ought ſurely to be better known, and reſcued from the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of thoſe churliſh virtuoſi, whoſe unſociable delight is to engroſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thoſe performances, which, in juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to their authors, as well as the world, they ought freely to communicate<note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <p>The <hi>Motetts</hi> of CALDARA, are noble, pathetic, and finely adapted to the purpoſes here mentioned. LOTTI and GASPARINI have alſo compoſed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pieces for the ſervice of the church. But, as only the ſame of them hath, as yet, reached me, I can only ſuppoſe them of a character, equal at leaſt to their other compoſitions, the peruſal of which have often afforded me a very ſingular pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>There is a compoſition for the church, which the connoiſſeurs, acquainted with its beauties, eſteem as inimitable in its way; namely, the <hi>Stabat Mater,</hi> &amp;c. of the Baron D'ASTORGA.

                     <p>If ever I have the felicity of ſeeing this work, I ſhall expect to find it more equally conducted than the <hi>Stabat Mater</hi> of PERGOLESE. For, though it is the diſtinguiſhed character of this latter compoſer, to have ſucceeded in the <hi>complaining, or ſorrowful ſtyle;</hi> yet I have often thought there was wanting, in ſeveral movements of his <hi>Stabat Mater,</hi> the juſt diſtinction, which ought always to be obſerved, between the tenderneſs or paſſion of a theatrical ſcene, and the ſolemnity of devotion.</p>

We may clearly diſcern the effects of ſuch a commerce as is here propoſed, with the works of the greateſt maſters. The immortal works of CORELLI are in the hands of every one; and accordingly we find, that from him many of our beſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern compoſers have generally deduced their elements of harmony. Yet there remains ſomething more to be done by our preſent profeſſors: they ought to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0666900500:91"/>
as intimately converſant with thoſe other great maſters, who, ſince CORELLI's time, have added both taſte and invention; and, by uniting theſe, have ſtill come nearer to the perfection of the <hi>general-harmonic compoſition.</hi>

               <p>The numerous ſeminaries in <hi>Italy</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail of producing a ſucceſſion of good maſters: from theſe we might ſelect ſuch pieces as would greatly contribute to the real ſolemnity of the cathedral ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

If it ſhould be aſked, who are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſons to begin a reform in our church-muſic? It may be anſwered, the organiſts of cathedrals, who are, or ought to be, our <hi>Maeſtri di Capella,</hi> and by whom, under the influence and protection of their deans, much might be done to the advancement of their choirs: nor would they find any difficulty in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing this uſeful deſign, as there are many precedents to direct them, both from Dr. ALDRIDGE and others, who have introduced into their ſervice the celebrated PALESTINA and CARISSIMI with great ſucceſs.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0666900500:93"/>
found to advance the dignity and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our cathedral ſervice; how much more may be expected at this time, from the number and variety of thoſe excellent compoſitions that have ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; and which may be eaſily procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and adapted to the purpoſes here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned!</p>

                     <p>As a precedent, I ſhall here take the liberty to conſider a late performance in ſuch a curſory manner, as may, perhaps, be proper enough on the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other muſical works hereafter.</p>

                     <p>Some general idea like this, of our muſical eſſays, on their firſt appearance, would not only incite a ſpirit of emulation among the compoſers, and render their works more worthy the public notice; but might alſo prove a more effectual reſtraint to the publiſhers, not to be ſo careleſs and dilatory on their part: for however inadvertent our compoſers may be, in putting their works incorrect out of their hands, their printers are ſeldom behind them in that point.</p>

Thus, and thus alone, can we hope to reach any tolerable degree of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the nobler kinds of muſical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The works of the greateſt maſters are the only ſchools where we may <hi>ſee,</hi> and from whence we may <hi>draw,</hi> perfection. And here, that I may do juſtice to what I think the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed merit, I ſhall mention, as exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of true <hi>muſical expreſſion,</hi> two great authors, the one admirable in <hi>vocal,</hi> the other in <hi>inſtrumental</hi> Muſic.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is BENEDETTO MARCELLO, whoſe inimitable freedom,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0666900500:96"/>
depth, and comprehenſive ſtyle, will ever remain the higheſt example to all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers for the church: for the ſervice of which, he publiſhed at <hi>Venice,</hi> near thirty years ago, the firſt fifty pſalms ſet to Muſic<note n="s" place="bottom">This work is contained in eight volumes in folio. The firſt four were publiſhed in the year 1724. And the whole came out complete two years after, under the following title, <hi>Eſtro Poetico Armonico, Parafraſi ſopra Salmi, Pocſia di</hi> GIROLAMO ASCANIO GIUSTINIANI, <hi>Muſica di</hi> BENEDETTO MARCELLO <hi>Patrizi Veniti, Venezia,</hi> 1726. There are ſome pieces of inſtrumental Muſic publiſhed in <hi>London,</hi> and ſaid to be compoſed by BENEDETTO MARCELLO, a <hi>Venetian</hi> nobleman; but as theſe are very mean performances, they cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to come from the ſame great author.</note>. Here he has far excelled all the Moderns, and given us the trueſt idea of that noble ſimplicity which probably was the grand characteriſtic of the ancient Muſic. In this extenſive and laborious undertaking, like the divine ſubject he works upon, he is generally either grand, beautiful, or pathetic; and ſo perfectly free from every thing that is low and common, that the judicious hearer is charmed with an endleſs variety of new
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0666900500:97"/>
and pleaſing modulation; together with a deſign and expreſſion ſo finely adapted, that the ſenſe and harmony do every where coincide. In the laſt pſalm, which is the fifty-firſt in our verſion, he ſeems to have collected all the powers of his vaſt genius, that he might ſurpaſs the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he had done before.</p>
               <p>I do not mean to affirm, that in this extenſive work, every recitative, air, or chorus, is of equal excellence. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued elevation of this kind, no author ever came up to. Nay, if we conſider that variety which in all arts is neceſſary to keep alive attention, we may, perhaps, affirm with truth, that <hi>inequality</hi> makes a part of the character of excellence: that ſomething ought to be thrown into ſhades, in order to make the lights more ſtriking. And, in this reſpect, MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLO is truly excellent: if ever he ſeems to <hi>fall,</hi> it is only to <hi>riſe</hi> with more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing majeſty and greatneſs<note n="t" place="bottom">

                        <l>To wake your fancy and prepare your ſight,</l>
                        <l>To reach the noble height of ſome unuſual flight.</l>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0666900500:98"/>
To this illuſtrious example in <hi>vocal,</hi> I ſhall add another, the greateſt in <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſic;</hi> I mean the admirable GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINIANI; whoſe elegance and ſpirit of compoſition ought to have been much more our pattern; and from whom the public taſte might have received the higheſt improvement, had we thought proper to lay hold of thoſe opportunities which his long reſidence in this kingdom has given us.</p>
               <p>The public is greatly indebted to this gentleman, not only for his many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent compoſitions, but for having as yet parted with none that are not extremely correct and fine. There is ſuch a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelneſs and delicacy in the turn of his muſical phraſe (if I may ſo call it), and ſuch a natural connection in his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſweet modulation throughout all his works, which are every where ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0666900500:99"/>
with ſo perfect a harmony, that we can never too often hear, or too much admire them. There are no impertinent digreſſions, no tireſome, unneceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions; but, from the beginning to the cloſe of his movement, all is natural and pleaſing. This it is properly to diſcourſe in Muſic, when our attention is kept up from one paſſage to another, ſo as the ear and the mind may be equally delighted.</p>
               <p>From an academy formed under ſuch a <hi>genius,</hi> what a ſupreme excellence of <hi>taſte</hi> might be expected<note n="u" place="bottom">
                     <p>To ſhew on what foundation this improvement in the muſical ſcience may be reſted, I will take the liberty to add the following remarks, from two unqueſtionable authorities on this head.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is from my Lord SHAFTESBURY, in his <hi>letter concerning deſign.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline">"I can, myſelf, remember the time, when, in reſpect of Muſic, our reigning taſte was, in many degrees, inferior to the <hi>French.</hi> The long reign of luxury and pleaſure under king <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the foreign helps and ſtudied ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages given to Muſic in a following reign, could not raiſe our genius the leaſt in this reſpect. But when the ſpirit of the nation was grown more free, though engaged at that time in the fierceſt war, and with the moſt doubtful ſucceſs, we no ſooner began to turn ourſelves towards Muſic, and enquire what <hi>Italy</hi> in particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, than, in an inſtant, we out-ſtripped our neighbours the <hi>French,</hi> entered into a genius far beyond theirs, and raiſed ourſelves an ear and judgement, not inferior to the beſt now in the world."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now, to obſerve with what improper regard this art has ſince been treated, we need only advert to the next remark from GEMINIANI's <hi>Introduction to a good Taſte in Muſic.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline">"When I came firſt to <hi>London,</hi> which was thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four years ago, I found Muſic in ſo thriving a ſtate, that I had all the reaſon imaginable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the growth would be ſuitable to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the ſoil. But I have lived to be moſt miſerably diſappointed; for, though it cannot be ſaid that there was any want of encouragement, that encouragement was ill beſtowed. The hand was more conſidered than the head; the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance than the compoſition; and hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that, inſtead of labouring to cultivate a taſte, which ſeemed to be all that was wanting, the public was content to nouriſh inſipidity."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This great maſter's firſt arrival amongſt us ſeems to have been much about that time, which the noble author above-mentioned hath fixed for the moſt flouriſhing ſtate of Muſic, and his ſentiments herein, I dare ſay, will appear reaſonable and fair to every impartial judge of the ſubject before us; eſpecially, as he hath done us the juſtice to aſſert, that Muſic, by proper culture and encouragement, may be brought to as great perfection in <hi>England,</hi> as in any other nation.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0666900500:101"/>
which are employed in the practice of Muſic, ſo theſe in their turn may be alſo conſidered.</p>
               <p>For, as <hi>Muſical Expreſſion</hi> in the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer,</hi> is ſucceeding in the attempt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſome particular paſſion<note n="x" place="bottom">The word <hi>paſſion</hi> is here taken in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive ſenſe, as it may be applied to every ſpecies of excellence in muſical compoſitions; which, from the very deſign of the compoſer, demands an <hi>energetic</hi> execution.</note>; ſo in the <hi>performer,</hi> it is to do a <hi>compoſition</hi> juſtice, by playing it in a <hi>taſte</hi> and <hi>ſtile</hi> ſo exactly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0666900500:102"/>
correſponding with the intention of the compoſer, as to preſerve and illuſtrate <hi>all</hi> the beauties of his work.</p>
               <p>Again, as the <hi>compoſer</hi> is culpable, who, for the ſake of ſome low and trifling <hi>imitation,</hi> deſerts the beauties of <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> ſo, that <hi>performer</hi> is ſtill more cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, who is induſtrious to reduce a good inſtrument to the ſtate of a bad one, by endeavouring to make it ſubſervient to a ſtill more trifling <hi>mimickry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such are all imitations of <hi>flageolets, horns, bagpipes,</hi> &amp;c. on the violin; a kind of low device, calculated merely to amaze, and which, even with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ear, cannot long prevail over the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural love of harmony<note n="y" place="bottom">
                     <p>The ſinging of a <hi>cuckoo,</hi> and the cackling of a hen, have, in fact, been often introduced into muſical performances. VIVALDI, in his ſeaſons, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certos, ſo called, has imitated the barking of a dog; beſides many other ſtrange contrivances; attempting even to deſcribe, as well as imitate, the various changes of the elements.</p>
                     <p>If thoſe compoſers, who take ſuch pleaſure in their muſical imitations of the noiſe of animals, will ſhew their ingenuity in that way, I would adviſe them rather to follow the much more effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of introducing the creatures themſelves. And, by way of example, I ſhall give them the following ſtory, as it is related by Mr. BAYLE, in his Critical Dictionary, under the article of LEWIS XI. <q rend="inline">"The Abbot DE BAIGNE, a man of great wit, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented many things relating to muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and, being in the ſervice of the king, was once commanded by him to procure him harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſounds from the cries of hogs, imagining the thing was abſolutely impoſſible. The Abbot was not in the leaſt perplexed at ſuch a command, but aſked the king money to perform it; which was immediately delivered to him, and he effected the moſt ſurprizing and remarkable thing that was ever heard. He got together a large quantity of hogs, all of different ages, and put them into a tent or pavillion covered with velvet, before which tent there was a wooden table all painted; and he made an organical inſtrument with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of ſtops ſo contrived, that, when he hit upon thoſe ſtops, it anſwered to ſome ſpikes, which, pricking the hogs that ſtood behind in a due order, made them cry in ſuch a harmonious manner, that the king and all his attendants were highly delighted with it."</q>
                     </p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0666900500:103"/>
Even the uſe of double ſtops on this inſtrument may, in my opinion, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one of the abuſes of it; ſince, in the hands of the greateſt maſters, they only deaden the tone, ſpoil the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and obſtruct the execution. In a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0666900500:104"/>
word, they baffle the performer's art, and bring down <hi>one good</hi> inſtrument to the ſtate of <hi>two indifferent ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſurely it ought chiefly to be the compoſer's care, not to give the performer any opportunities whatever of diſparaging his art: and the more he avoids all ſuch low buffoonry, the more will this falſe taſte be diſcouraged: for whatever may be alledged againſt the depravity of our taſte in the muſical ſcience, it certainly can be fixed no where ſo properly, as on the maſters themſelves; ſince, were they to perſiſt with any ſpirit or reſolution in the exerciſe of their genius in ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions only as are worthy of them, they would undoubtedly improve the public ear, and acquire to themſelves a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and character worth preſerving<note n="z" place="bottom">There is one circumſtance, that might tend greatly to the repute and utility of Muſic; which is, that the profeſſors themſelves would cultivate a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and friendly commerce with each other, and cheriſh that benevolent temper, which their daily employ, one ſhould think, ought naturally to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire. In truth, there is nothing enlarges the mind to every ſocial and laudable purpoſe, ſo much as this delightful intercourſe with harmony. They who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>ence: for whatever pretenſions they may otherwiſe have to a reliſh or knowledge of its laws, without this criterion of the muſical ſoul, all other pretended ſignatures of genius we may look upon as counterfeit.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0666900500:105"/>
Let every compoſer, whether for the church, the theatre, or chamber, thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider the nature and compaſs of the voices, or inſtruments, that are employed in his work; and, by that means, he will the more eaſily avoid the common error of not ſufficiently diſtinguiſhing what ſtile or manner is proper for execution, and what for expreſſion.</p>
               <p>He ſhould alſo minutely obſerve the different qualities of the inſtruments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for, as vocal Muſic requires one kind of expreſſion, and inſtrumental an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſo different inſtruments have alſo a different expreſſion peculiar to them.</p>
               <p>Thus, the <hi>hautboy</hi> will beſt expreſs the <hi>cantabile,</hi> or ſinging ſtyle, and may be uſed in all movements whatever under
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0666900500:106"/>
this denomination; eſpecially thoſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which tend to the <hi>gay</hi> and <hi>chearful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In compoſitions for the <hi>German</hi> flute, is required the ſame method of proceeding by <hi>conjoint degrees,</hi> or ſuch other natural intervals, as, with the nature of its tone, will beſt expreſs the languiſhing, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſtyle. With both theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the running into <hi>extreme keys,</hi> the uſe of the <hi>ſtaccato,</hi> or diſtinct ſeparation of notes; and all irregular leaps, or broken and uneven intervals, muſt be avoided; for which reaſon alone, theſe inſtruments ought never to be employed in the <hi>repieno parts</hi> of concertos for violins, but in ſuch pieces only as are compoſed for them; and theſe, perhaps, would be moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably introduced as principal inſtruments in ſome intervening movements in the concerto, which might not only give a pleaſing variety, but ſhew their different expreſſion to the greateſt advantage.</p>
               <p>In continued compoſitions, particularly for the <hi>German</hi> flute, our compoſers have been not a little unſucceſsful; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0666900500:107"/>
this failure may be imputed to the deficiency of the inſtrument, or their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to exceed its natural expreſſion, may, perhaps, be worth the compoſer's while to conſider.</p>
               <p>The <hi>baſſoon</hi> ſhould alſo have thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual movements which naturally glide in their diviſions, and have the eaſieſt tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from one key to another; and may be admitted as a <hi>principal</hi> in the <hi>ſolo,</hi> or <hi>rinforzo</hi> in the <hi>chorus,</hi> but never in the latter without a ſufficient number of other baſſes to qualify and ſupport it<note n="a" place="bottom">See the ſixth of GEMINIANI's Concertos, <hi>

               <p>The <hi>trumpet</hi> and <hi>French-horn,</hi> though equally limited in their <hi>ſcale,</hi> yet have pieces of very different ſtyles adapted to them. The one, perhaps, to animate and inſpire courage; the other to enliven and chear the ſpirits; yet are not both to be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0666900500:108"/>
alike diſcarded in the <hi>figurate deſcant,</hi> or that part of compoſition where diſcords are concerned. In this ſpecies of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony I have known the French-horn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced with amazing ſucceſs; but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a very able compoſer to manage it properly with ſuch accompanyments. Either of theſe inſtruments, when fully accompanied, produce more wonderful effects than when heard alone, becauſe in all martial compoſitions, their airs and expreſſion are of ſo plain and unmixed a nature, that their harmony is more eaſily comprehended; and thence they ſtrike the common ear with a greater degree of pleaſure and admiration than any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument whatever.</p>
               <p>The <hi>organ</hi> and <hi>harpſichord,</hi> though alike in ſo many reſpects, that the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former may equally ſhew his ſkill and execution on both; yet are their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive compoſitions and manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance widely different: the former expreſſing the grand or ſolemn ſtile, the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0666900500:109"/>
latter, thoſe lively or trickling movements which thrill in the ear.</p>
               <p>Now, where any of the above inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments over-rule in concert, whether in the chorus, or ſolo; or are appointed to play ſuch airs or movements as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily expreſs; we may then conclude, that the compoſer hath unfortunately ſet out upon a wrong principle, which capital error will deſtroy every good effect that might have been found in his work, had he duly conſidered the diſtinct limits and properties of each inſtrument.</p>
               <p>In claſſing the different inſtruments in concert, we may conſider them as the various ſtops which complete a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: and as the ſkillful artiſt ſo contrives, that, when the full organ is heard, no <hi>mixtures,</hi> or <hi>furnitures,</hi> &amp;c. ſhall predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, but that the <hi>diapaſons,</hi> with their <hi>octaves</hi>

                  <hi>principals</hi> of the concert: for in fact they may be ſaid to contain the very ſtrength and ſpirit of all harmony; and have in them, not only the expreſſion of all the other inſtruments, but contain a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous variety of many other noble proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties peculiar to themſelves, of which all the reſt are utterly deſtitute. It is their remarkable diſtinction, that no concert can be formed without them, as they unite and agree as well with every inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as with each other, and return every advantage they receive. And, as the fineſt <hi>inſtrumental Muſic</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an imitation of the <hi>vocal;</hi> ſo do theſe inſtruments, with their expreſſive tone and the minuteſt changes they are capable of in the progreſſion of melody, ſhew their neareſt approaches to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the human voice.</p>
               <p>Let the lover of Muſic call to mind the delightful effects they afford, when joined with the organ to a chorus of good voices, particularly in churches where the expanſion is large and ample, to ſoften
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0666900500:111"/>
every rough and grating ſound, and unite the variety of voices and other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that complete this grand and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn performance; he will, even in this ideal enjoyment of Muſic, with pleaſure own and prefer their harmonious expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>In fine, it is in thoſe productions only which include the violin and its ſpecies, where an extenſive genius may rove at large through all the various kinds of muſical expreſſion; and may give the beſt performers, though not in capricious and extravagant flights, every deſirable opportunity of ſhewing their ſkill.</p>
               <p>As a remarkable inſtance of the power of expreſſion in a performance on this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, I cannot omit the mention of three maſters, within my own knowledge. KNERLER, with great execution and a fine tone, but unſuſceptible of the powers of expreſſion, always diſappointed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ear: CARBONEL, with but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon portion of thoſe qualities ſo requiſite to enforce an expreſſion, by a natural and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0666900500:112"/>
inſtant feeling of the tender ſtrokes in a fine compoſition, never failed to give all the pleaſure that could be expected from them. But if we would hear theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualities united in their full perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt repair to the admired GIARDINI. The brilliancy and Fullneſs of his tone, the ſweetneſs, ſpirit, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of his expreſſion, his amazing rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of execution, and exuberance of fancy, joined with the moſt perfect eaſe and gracefulneſs in the performance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to ſet him at the head of his <note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <p>Since the appearance of this great performer, the Signiors PLA, PASSARINI, and CHABRAN, have alſo excited the admiration of the town: yet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> all, it is but too general an obſervation (and I cannot help repeating it) that even the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, when left to themſelves, cannot reſiſt the vanity of amazing the multitude.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon, the judicious hearer will always prefer their accompanyment in vocal performances, where every kind of unmeaning execution muſt give way to a more natural harmony; and their happier talents are employed, in aſſiſting the voice, through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0666900500:113"/>
Thus, the judicious performer, by this exertion of his <hi>fort</hi> or maſter-ſtyle, may poſſibly give a pleaſing tenderneſs or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, even to an indifferent compoſition; while, on the other hand, a neglect, or ignorance, of the uſe of this art, however expert in other reſpects the performer may be, will diſguiſe, if not intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, thoſe diſtinguiſhed beauties, which alone can raiſe the dignity and perfection of Muſic.</p>
               <p>I dare ſay the reader will anticipate the ſimilar caſe I am about to mention in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>reading;</hi> as it will naturally occur to him, on this head, how commanding the power of expreſſion may be found, from a different manner of reading the ſame author; eſpecially in poetry, where a juſt and ſpirited emphaſis is ſo highly eſſential to point out thoſe intereſting ſtrokes, which are more peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to delight the imagination and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the heart. But how infinitely ſhort of this deſign, is the beſt-wrote poem, whether we hear it rehearſed with wild
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0666900500:114"/>
and vehement accents, or repeated in a cold and lifeleſs <hi>monotone!</hi> In either of theſe caſes, our diſguſt, or wearineſs of attention, will be found in proportion to the beauties of the author ſo abuſed. And juſt thus it fares with an injudicious performance of a fine muſical compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The different ſpecies of Muſic, for the <hi>church,</hi> the <hi>theatre,</hi> or the <hi>chamber,</hi> are, or ſhould be, diſtinguiſhed by their peculiar expreſſion. It may eaſily be perceived, that it is not the <hi>time</hi> or <hi>meaſure,</hi> ſo much as <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>expreſſion,</hi> which ſtamps the real character of the piece. A well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought <hi>allegro,</hi> or any other quick movement for the church, cannot, with propriety, be adapted to theatrical pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; nor can the <hi>adagio</hi> of this latter kind, ſtrictly ſpeaking, be introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the former: I have known ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of this nature attempted, but never with ſucceſs. For, the ſame pieces which may juſtly enough be thought very ſolemn in the theatre, to an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0666900500:115"/>
ear, will be found too light and trivial, when they are performed in the church: and this, I may venture to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, would be the caſe, though we had never heard them but in ſome anthem, or other divine performance: and were, therefore, not ſubject to the prejudice, which their being heard in an opera might occaſion<note n="d" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">"By the <hi>ancients, airs</hi> were ſung in three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manners; for the theatre, the ſtyle was lively and various; for the chamber, delicate and finiſhed; for the church, moving and grave. This difference, to very many <hi>moderns,</hi> is quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known<note n="*" place="bottom">See TOSI on the florid ſong, p. 92.</note>."</q>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>It is alſo by this efficacy of muſical expreſſion, that a good ear doth aſcertain the various terms which are generally made uſe of to direct the performer. For inſtance, the words <hi>andante, preſto, allegro,</hi> &amp;c. are differently applied in the different kinds of Muſic above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for, the ſame terms which denote <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>gay,</hi> in the opera, or concert ſtyle, may be underſtood in the practice
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0666900500:116"/>
of church-muſic, as, <hi>chearful</hi> and <hi>ſerene,</hi> or, if the reader pleaſes, leſs lively and gay: wherefore, the <hi>allegro,</hi> &amp;c. in this kind of compoſition, ſhould always be performed ſomewhat ſlower than is uſual in concertos or operas.</p>
               <p>By this obſervation we may learn, that theſe words do not always convey what they import in their ſtrict ſenſe, but are to be conſidered as relative terms; and if they cannot fully anſwer the compoſer's intention of communicating, to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, the nature of each particular ſtyle; yet, are they more proper than any other for that purpoſe: however, the compoſer will always be ſubject to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of leaving great latitude to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former; who, nevertheleſs, may be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted therein, by his perception of the powers of expreſſion.</p>
               <p>In vocal Muſic he can never fail; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if the different paſſions which the poet intends to raiſe, are juſtly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and expreſſed by the compoſer's art; the ſenſible performer will feel this happy
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0666900500:117"/>
union of both the arts, and thence join his own to perfect the whole.</p>
               <p>With regard to the inſtrumental kind; the <hi>ſtyle</hi> and <hi>air</hi> of the <hi>movement</hi> muſt chiefly determine the exact <hi>time</hi> and <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> in which it ought to be performed: and unleſs we ſtrictly attend to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, the moſt excellent compoſitions may be greatly injured, eſpecially when the compoſer is not preſent, either to lead, or give the <hi>air</hi> of his piece.</p>
               <p>I might conclude this head with an obſervation or two on the ſeveral <hi>graces</hi> or ornaments of expreſſion: but as theſe are already enumerated, and ſufficiently explained in the rules of GEMINIANI, I need only refer to that work. However, we may here remark, that, were theſe elements of playing in taſte, with their diſtinct characters and explanations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the general ſtandard, as well for the performance of maſters, as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their pupils; the former, I believe, would not only find them capable of heightening the very beſt compoſitions,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0666900500:118"/>
but the latter would alſo, with greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, arrive at perfection. But, inſtead of this, the generality of our maſters, following each their own method, have preferred a more looſe and florid manner of gracing, by which the fineſt harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are too often deſtroyed; and in their explanation of theſe graces, by ſo many different marks, and crowds of little notes, impoſſible to be expreſſed, have rather perplexed the learner, who, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame art ſo variouſly taught, hath, therefore, been often diſcouraged in the progreſs of his ſtudy.</p>
               <p>And, as we have diſtinguiſhed this maſter, as a pattern of excellence in his <hi>compoſitions,</hi> ſo we muſt allow him to have been equally excellent in his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance;</hi> for, in this reſpect, he was alſo peculiarly happy in his various expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as well of the <hi>tender,</hi> the <hi>ſerene,</hi> the <hi>ſolemn,</hi> as of the <hi>joyous</hi> and <hi>rapid;</hi> and, with a ready and proper execution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways entered into a true feeling of the ſpirit, or ſoftneſs, ſuitable to each of theſe

               <head>SECT. II. ON THE EXPRESSIVE PERFORMANCES OF MUSIC IN PARTS.</head>
               <p>HAVING ſaid ſo much with regard to the expreſſive performance of Muſic in general, I ſhall now conclude with a few hints which may be of ſervice in the performance of full Muſic: eſpecially of ſuch <hi>concertos</hi> as have pretty near an equal ſhare of <hi>air</hi> and <hi>expreſſion</hi> in all their parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0666900500:120"/>
The firſt material circumſtance which ought to be conſidered in the performance of this kind of compoſition, is, the number and quality of thoſe inſtruments that may produce the beſt effect.</p>
               <p>And, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> I would propoſe, excluſive of the four principal parts which muſt be always complete, that the chorus of other inſtruments ſhould not exceed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber following, <hi>viz.</hi> ſix <hi>primo,</hi> and four <hi>ſecondo repienos;</hi> four <hi>repieno baſſes,</hi> and two <hi>double baſſes,</hi> and a <hi>harpſichord.</hi> A leſſer number of inſtruments, near the ſame proportion, will alſo have a proper effect, and may anſwer the compoſer's intention; but more would probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the juſt contraſt, which ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be kept up between the <hi>chorus</hi> and <hi>ſolo:</hi> for in this caſe the effect of two or three ſingle inſtruments would be loſt and over-powered by the ſucceſſion of too grand a <hi>chorus;</hi> and to double the <hi>primo,</hi> and <hi>ſecondo concertino,</hi> or <hi>violoncello</hi> in the <hi>ſolo,</hi> would be an impropriety in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our muſical oeconomy, too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0666900500:121"/>
to require any thing to be ſaid on that head. It may be objected, perhaps, that the number of <hi>baſſes,</hi> in the above calculation, would be found too powerful for the <hi>violins:</hi> but as the latter inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in their tone ſo clear, ſprightly, and piercing, and as they rather gain more force by this addition, they will always be heard: however, if it were poſſible, there ſhould never be wanting a <hi>double baſs;</hi> eſpecially in a performance of full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certos, as they cannot be heard to any advantage without that NOBLE FOUNDA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION of their harmony.</p>
               <p>As to wind-inſtruments, theſe are all ſo different in their tone, and in their progreſſions through the various keys, from thoſe of the ſtringed kind, beſides the irremediable diſagreement of their riſing in their pitch, while the others are probably falling, that they ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be continued too long in uſe, nor employed but in ſuch pieces as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly adapted to them; ſo that in the general work of concertos, for violins,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0666900500:122"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are almoſt always improper; unleſs we admit of the <hi>baſſoon,</hi> which, if performed by an expert hand, in a ſoft and ready tone, and only in thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are natural to it, may then be of ſingular uſe, and add fullneſs to the harmony.</p>
               <p>Did every performer know the <hi>fort</hi> of his inſtrument, and where its beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion lay, <hi>there</hi> to exert it moſt; I ſhould have but little pretence for my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent attempt in the enſuing directions.</p>
               <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> In the four principal parts there ought to be four performers of almoſt equal maſtery; as well in regard to <hi>time</hi> as <hi>execution;</hi> for however eaſy it may ſeem to acquire the former, yet nothing more ſhews a maſter than a ſteady per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance throughout the whole move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore chiefly neceſſary in the leading parts. But this rule is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neglected by placing one of the worſt hands to the <hi>tenor;</hi> which, though a part of little execution, yet requires ſo much meaning and expreſſion, that the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0666900500:123"/>
performer ſhould not only give a fine tone, (the peculiar quality of that inſtrument) but by ſwelling and ſinging of the notes, and entering into the ſpirit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, know, without deſtroying the <hi>air,</hi> where to fill the <hi>harmony;</hi> and, by boldly pointing the ſubject, keep it up with the greateſt energy<note n="e" place="bottom">
                     <p>As when we find a juſt and happy ſubſerviency in all the under parts of a compoſition, we conclude the compoſer to be a man of experience and good ſenſe: ſo alſo, thoſe only are the performers or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and good taſte, who can feel, and, with delight, expreſs thoſe beauties undiſtinguiſhed by the common ear.</p>
                     <p>It is their part alſo to diſcern, how little it avails, to attempt any ſervice in the performance, where theſe attendants to the principal part, are either ſuperfluous in themſelves, or inharmonious in their effect; and where they deſtroy, inſtead of aiding the <hi>maſter-ſubject,</hi> or other appointed <hi>airs</hi> in the piece.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> The ſame rule will ſerve for all the other inſtruments except the <hi>harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord;</hi> and as this is only to be uſed in the <hi>chorus,</hi> the performer will have little elſe to regard but the ſtriking juſt chords, keeping the time, and being careful that no jangling ſound or ſcattering of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0666900500:124"/>
notes be continued after the pauſe or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. During this interval of reſt, he ſhould alſo attend, with the utmoſt exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the leading off again the remaining part of the movement, that when all the parts are thus inſtantly ſtruck, his own may be found to pervade and fill the whole: and if there are any reſts ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the pauſe, his attention to the leading inſtrument will direct him when theſe are to commence. The ſame care is neceſſary at the return of each double ſtrain, when there are no intermediate notes to introduce the repeat. In fine, a profound ſilence muſt be always obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherever the compoſer has intended a general reſpite, or pauſe in his work. I am the more particular in giving this caution to performers on the harpſichord, as they are the moſt liable to tranſgreſs in this way; becauſe their inſtrument, lying ſo commodious to their fingers, is ever tempting them to run like wild-fire over the keys, and thus perpetually interrupt the performance. As compoſitions of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0666900500:125"/>
this nature are not calculated for the ſake of any one inſtrument, but to give a grand effect by uniting many, each performer ought therefore to conſider his particular province, and ſo far only to exert himſelf as may be conſiſtent with the harmony and expreſſion in his part. Nor let any lover of Muſic be concerned if there is but little for him to execute, ſince he will thence have ſome leiſure for the pleaſure of hearing: for this reaſon, the under parts in good compoſitions are more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to the performer, who would rather enjoy the whole than be diſtinguiſhed alone.</p>

But theſe graceful touches are only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a maſterly application in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0666900500:126"/>
accompanyment of a fine voice, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtrument; and therefore, beſides the difficulty of acquiring a competent ſkill in them, they are not required in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of full Muſic.</p>
               <p>Under this article I ſhall beg leave to offer an obſervation on the harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord concerto; a ſpecies of compoſition but of late invention, and which, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſtudied, will admit of conſiderable improvements. Hitherto we ſeem to have miſtaken the property of this inſtrument, by not conſidering what it can, or cannot expreſs. Hence it is, perhaps, that our compoſers have run all their concertos into little elſe than tedious diviſions; and the ſubject or ground-work of theſe, being introduced and repeated by a chorus of violins, produce always a bad effect: whereas the violin parts ſhould be but few, and contrived rather as accompanyments than ſymphonies; by which means they may aſſiſt greatly in ſtriking out ſome kind of expreſſion,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0666900500:127"/>
wherein the harpſichord<note n="g" place="bottom">See RAMEAU's concertos for the harpſichord, publiſhed by Mr. WALSH.</note> is remarkably deficient<note n="h" place="bottom">Performers on the harpſichord, in concertos for that inſtrument, ought to take notice, that <hi>ſtaccato diviſions,</hi> on one note, ſhould be played with differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fingers, wherever it can be done with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience; and not with one finger only, becauſe, in this caſe, it is impoſſible to move the wriſt (which the quick repetition of one note with one finger would require) with freedom enough to give theſe kind of paſſages their proper force.</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſame method, perhaps, may be equally proper in concertos for the organ: which being frequently employed in other compoſitions, and at preſent ſo generally approved, it may not be amiſs to conſider it farther. For however capable this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument may be found to fill or ſoften all the reſt, it will nevertheleſs over-power and deſtroy them, if the performer is not extremely cautious and tender in the uſe of it. I would therefore propoſe that the accompanyments in the thorough-baſs ſhould never be ſtruck in chords with the right-hand, as upon the harpſichord, but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0666900500:128"/>
in all the full parts the leading ſubject ſhould be ſingly touched, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former proceed through the reſt of the movement with the left-hand only. For this reaſon, no perſon whatever ſhould attempt this inſtrument in concertos not expreſsly made for it, but from the <hi>ſcore;</hi> and then, if he has judgement and diſcretion ſufficient, he may enforce an expreſſion, and aſſiſt every part through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole chorus. Yet I cannot diſmiſs this article without once again obſerving, that the difficulties of render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the organ of that uſe in full concert which many expect from it, are ſo various and intricate, that we can never be too careful of the performer's abilities; who, if thoroughly ſkillful, will ſo manage his inſtrument, that it may always be heard, but ſeldom diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> As in all concertos, overtures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the <hi>repieno</hi> parts are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately neceſſary, the compoſer ought to purſue ſome deſign in filling each chorus, and relieving them with paſſages
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0666900500:129"/>
either proper to be heard alone, or ſo contrived as to give a good effect to the repeated <hi>chorus;</hi> ſo in performing theſe different paſſages, a different manner muſt be obſerved. Thus, when the <hi>ſolo</hi> is contrived for the ſake of ſome peculiar expreſſion, it ſhould then be performed in a manner ſuitable to the genius or character of the piece; but always plain, or however with ſuch graces only as may heighten the expreſſion without varying the time; and which, therefore, require other qualities beſides an execution to do them juſtice: for this elegance of taſte, in the performance of the ſolo, conſiſts not in thoſe agile motions, or ſhiftings of the hand, which ſtrike with ſurprize the common ear, but in the tender and delicate touches, which to ſuch indeed are leaſt perceptible, but to a fine ear productive of the higheſt delight. Let not the performer then by an ill-judged execution miſapply this opportunity of ſhewing his ſkill in theſe remarkable places: for though it is not the advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0666900500:130"/>
of inſtrumental compoſitions to be heightened in their expreſſion by the help of words, yet there is generally, or ought to be, ſome idea of ſenſe or paſſion, beſides that of mere ſound, conveyed to the hearer<note n="i" place="bottom">

               <p>Above all, to heighten this variety in the performance, it is eſſential to mark the change of ſtiles that may often be found in the ſame movement, and chiefly the <hi>ſoſtenute</hi> and <hi>ſtaccato,</hi> for in theſe are contained the greateſt powers of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the violin.</p>
               <p>Sounds continued, or ſucceeding each other without interruption, muſt be gently ſwelled and decreaſed, and this without drawling or languor. All cut ſounds ſhould be moderately ſtruck, yet clear and diſtinct, that every ſhrill and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

               <p>Though few performers can feel the nice diſtinctions that lie between the beauties and errors in each of theſe ſtiles; yet many are ſenſible of their very oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite effects: and this circumſtance alone will greatly aſſiſt thoſe who would play either with tenderneſs or ſpirit.</p>
               <p>7<hi>thly,</hi> As diſcords in Muſic are like ſhades in painting, ſo is the <hi>piano</hi> like the fainter parts or figures in a picture; both which do greatly aſſiſt in conſtituting and ſupporting an agreeable variety.

Yet how often do they paſs unobſerved, or, if at all expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in ſo careleſs and negligent a manner,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0666900500:134"/>
as to produce little, if any, ſenſible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the hearer! It is a common practice with thoſe luke-warm performers, who imagine that diminiſhing the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inſtruments will anſwer the ſame end as ſoftening the whole, to quit their part when they ſhould rather be all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention how to manage it with the utmoſt delicacy; tranſporting, as it were, like the ſwell-organ, the leſſening ſounds to a vaſt diſtance, and thence returning with redoubled ſtrength and fullneſs to the <hi>forte:</hi> and as this delightful effect can only be found from a performance of many inſtruments together, we ought never to omit ſuch opportunities of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying this noble contraſt to its higheſt perfection.</p>
               <p>8<hi>thly,</hi> When the inner parts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as accompanyments only, great care ſhould be had to touch them in ſuch a manner, that they may never predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but be always ſubſervient to the principal performer, who alſo ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame method, whenever his part
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0666900500:135"/>
becomes an accompanyment; which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally happens in well-wrought fugues and other full pieces, where the ſubject and air are almoſt equally diſtributed. When the attention of every performer is thus employed by liſtening to the other parts, without which he cannot do juſtice to his own, it is then we may expect to hear the proper effect of the whole.</p>
               <p>9<hi>thly,</hi> In every part throughout the full chorus, all manner of graces, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of intervals, or tranſpoſition of eight notes higher, muſt be avoided; which ſome indiſcreet performers are but too apt to make uſe of, merely from a deſire of being diſtinguiſhed, and that the audience may admire their execution. But theſe gentlemen ought to conſider, that by ſuch liberties they do not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint the expecting ear, of a juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome favourite part, but often introduce and occaſion <hi>diſallowances</hi> in the harmony. From the ſame ruling paſſion we ſometimes hear performers, the moment a piece is ended, run over their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0666900500:136"/>
inſtrument, forgetting that order, like ſilence under arms in the military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſhould alſo be obſerved in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Muſic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To point out in all the parts of full Muſic, their various ſubjects or fugues, I have ventured to introduce a new muſical character, namely, this moſtra (<gap reason="symbol" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                  </gap>) or index: but as the particular uſe I would apply it to, may poſſibly be thought by ſome, a groundleſs innovation, it will therefore be neceſſary to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in its defence and explanation<note n="m" place="bottom">See ſix concertos publiſhed by JOHNSON, where the uſe of this mark is applied: as this character is eaſily made by the pen, it may, with very little trouble, be added to the proper places, either in manuſcript or other printed concertos that require it.</note>.</p>
               <p>In all compoſitions for inſtruments in parts, which are publiſhed in ſeparate books, and ſeldom peruſed in <hi>ſcore,</hi> moſt performers are frequently at a loſs, to know the compoſer's deſign: hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed many diſcordant <hi>ricercate</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="bottom">Extempore flouriſhings.</note>, where
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0666900500:137"/>
only the full unmixed harmony ſhould be heard. Another conſequence has been, that, for want of ſome ſuch character as the moſtra above-mentioned, the very beſt contrivances in a good compoſition have often paſſed undiſtinguiſhed and neglected. To remedy this defect, it ſeems neceſſary to point out in each part every <hi>leading</hi> and <hi>reſponſive</hi> fugue: for which purpoſe ſome particular mark ſhould be placed over the firſt note of every <hi>accidental</hi> ſubject as well as <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal;</hi> the former being rather more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be thus diſtinguiſhed, as every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon capable of performing in concert muſt know the principal ſubject wherever it occurs, and therefore will of courſe give <hi>that</hi> its proper expreſſion.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>accidental</hi> ſubjects are, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their variety, much more difficult to be aſcertained: ſometimes indeed they are a part or accompanyment of the <hi>principal,</hi> and then may be ſtyled a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third ſubject, as they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repeated, or at leaſt ſo retouched in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0666900500:138"/>
the progreſs of the fugue as to render them eaſily known. But yet there are oftentimes other ſubjects very different from the principal, and which being ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never repeated, are therefore ſtill more neceſſary to be marked; for having always ſome peculiar relation to the other parts, it is abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould be juſtly expreſſed; and this can only be done by a ſimple, plain, yet ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic execution: for wherever a ſubject is propoſed, it can never with propriety admit of any variation. Expreſſion alone being ſufficient to give us every thing that can be deſired from harmony.</p>
               <p>Thus, by a due obſervance of ſome ſuch character as the <hi>moſtra,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former will be greatly aſſiſted to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all the harmony and contrivances of the compoſer, and obtain an advantage and pleaſure almoſt equal to that of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſcore<note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <p>Though we may partly conjecture at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the <hi>air</hi> and <hi>expreſſion</hi> of particular paſſages in a compoſition, without a complete performance in all the parts; yet of the <hi>harmony</hi> and relation theſe may bear to each other, we cannot form a peremptory judgement: and more eſpecially as we are often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in our opinions of full Muſic, from thoſe faint and imperfect trials, to which, for want of proper hands, they are frequently expoſed; where theſe are deficient, whether in number or abilities, I know not a more effectual teſt than a good harpſichord and performance from the <hi>ſcore,</hi> where the eye will aſſiſt the ear through all the defects of this inſtrument, and give a better idea of the compoſer's deſign than any unſucceſsful attempt in concert.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon, were the printers of Muſic to publiſh the beſt <hi>concertos</hi> and <hi>ſonatas</hi> in <hi>ſcore,</hi> as are thoſe of CORELLI; perhaps this very expedient, though it may ſeem hazardous at firſt, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more to a general good taſte and knowledge of Muſic, than any yet thought of; and the ſucceſs that may reaſonably be expected from ſo uſeful an undertaking, will, in the long-run, amply reward them for all their trouble and expence.</p>
                     <p>I have heard the firſt publiſher of CORELLI's works in ſcore, very frankly acknowledge, that the profits received from the ſale of theſe books, were greater than could have been expected: and, as the public has had almoſt twenty years trial of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that have accrued from ſuch an intimate acquaintance with this claſſical compoſer; it cannot, I think, be doubted but a like good effect might alſo attend a publication in ſcore of GEMINIANI's concertos; and of other compoſitions in parts, which may have deſervedly gained a reputation.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0666900500:139"/>
By what has been ſaid, it appears, that this mark will be of ſimilar uſe in Muſic,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0666900500:140"/>
to that of <hi>capitals, italicks,</hi> and other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thographical illuſtrations in writing; and therefore, perhaps, may make the chance which a muſical author has for ſucceſs, more nearly equal to that of a literary one; for it is certain that the former at preſent lies under ſo many additional diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, that whatever ſerves to leſſen or remove any of them, ſhould be thought an invention of no trivial utility.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, how often does the fate of a concerto depend on the random execution of a ſett of performers who have never previouſly conſidered the work, examined the connection of its parts, or ſtudied the intention of the whole?</p>

               <p>THE Muſic of the Ancients and of the Moderns hath been often and fully diſcuſſed by the learned, and I have only a ſlender and ſuperficial knowledge of the theory either of the former or of the latter.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>ima,</hi> the <hi>loweſt.</hi> The <hi>higheſt</hi> was that chord which gave the <hi>deepeſt</hi> or <hi>graveſt</hi> ſound, the <hi>loweſt</hi> that which gave the <hi>acuteſt</hi> ſound; and therefore, what we call ASCENDING, they called DESCEND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING. Thus for example, if you compare the <hi>open</hi> ſtrings of a violin to the tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord, (though their proportions are not the ſame,) the ſtring which ſounds G, would have been with them the <hi>higheſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0666900500:144"/>
and that which ſounds E, would have been the <hi>loweſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in their tetrachord, their <hi>loweſt</hi> was a <hi>fourth</hi> to their <hi>higheſt,</hi> the ſenſe of <hi>Horace</hi> is, that <hi>Tigellius</hi> ſang the air, <hi>Io Bacche,</hi> and then would ſing it over again, what we call, <hi>a fourth higher. Vox ſumma</hi> is the baſs, and <hi>vox ima</hi> the treble.</p>
               <p>Apply this to the <hi>Muſic of the ſpheres.</hi> The old <hi>planetary ſyſtem</hi> may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an <hi>heptachord,</hi> an inſtrument with ſeven ſtrings, anſwering to the ſeven notes in Muſic.

               <p>The concords of the Ancients were the <hi>fourth, fifth,</hi> and <hi>eighth.</hi> The <hi>third,</hi>

               <p>From <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> and his commentator, <hi>Wallis,</hi> it may be collected how (according to their ſyſtem) the <hi>ſeven modes</hi> anſwer to our notes; and alſo how they ſtood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to each other, not according to the vicinity of notes, and as B is next to A, but as one mode produced another at the intervals of <hi>fourths</hi> or of <hi>fifths,</hi> which ſeem to have been the paſſages by which the Ancients made tranſitions from mode to mode.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, in our modern ſyſtem, and in the <hi>major tone,</hi> the key of C <hi>natural</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0666900500:150"/>
requires none but <hi>natural</hi> notes.

               <p>The <hi>keys</hi> may be conſidered as related to each other, more or leſs, according as their tranſpoſition makes more or leſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the ſyſtem.

               <p>I ſhall here mention ſome of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which the modern <hi>diatonic</hi> ſyſtem ſeems to have above the Ancient.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0666900500:151"/>
1. By dividing every <hi>tone</hi> into <hi>ſemi tones</hi> we have a great variety of <hi>tranſpoſed keys,</hi> or <hi>modes,</hi> or <hi>tones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By making uſe of the <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor third,</hi> we have <hi>two</hi> real and diſtinct <hi>tones,</hi> a <hi>major</hi> and a <hi>minor,</hi> which may be ſaid to divide Muſic, as nature ſeems to have intended, into the <hi>male</hi> and the <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</hi> The firſt hath ſtrength, the ſecond hath ſoftneſs; and ſweetneſs belongs to them both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our <hi>minor tone</hi> is improved by borrowing from its <hi>major tone</hi> a <hi>major ſixth</hi> and <hi>ſeventh,</hi> to help its progreſs to the <hi>eighth.</hi> Thus A with a <hi>minor third</hi> takes the <hi>ſharp</hi> F, and the <hi>ſharp</hi> G, from A with a <hi>major third,</hi> when it aſcends to its <hi>octave,</hi> and quits them when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By the aid of <hi>ſemitones,</hi> we can mix the <hi>chromatic</hi> with the <hi>diatonic</hi> Muſic.</p>
               <p>The INTRODUCING a ſucceſſion of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitones</hi> hath, on proper occaſions, a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful effect, as in <hi>Handel's</hi> incomparable <hi>ombra chara,</hi> in his <hi>Radamiſtus,</hi> an <hi>opera</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0666900500:152"/>
abounding with the happieſt union and mixture of <hi>art</hi> and <hi>invention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The DIVISION of <hi>ſemitones</hi> into <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor,</hi> and the <hi>quarter notes,</hi> which belong to the <hi>enharmonic</hi> ſyſtem, are no inconſiderable part of <hi>theoretical</hi> Muſic. The harpſichord takes no notice of them, not being divided for that purpoſe; but though in this and in ſome other reſpects it be defective, it hath the advantage of being a very practicable and a moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtrument, and of accommodating itſelf well enough to the change of keys, and to all keys that are not overloaded with <hi>flats</hi> or <hi>ſharps;</hi> eſpecially when the defects are ſo judiciouſly diſtributed by the tuner, as not to offend the ear groſsly in any place; which ſeems to be the beſt <hi>temperature</hi> of the <hi>muſical circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I forgot to ſay a word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the origin and generation of the <hi>diatonic</hi> ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>The old <hi>tetrachord</hi> was B, C, D, E. Add another to it of the ſame kind, and with the ſame proportions, E, F, G, A.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0666900500:153"/>
Join them, B, C, D, E, F, G, A. Add an octave at the bottom, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A.</p>
               <p>As the firſt tetrachord had a <hi>minor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> that <hi>ſecond</hi> becomes a <hi>minor third,</hi> when A is added below.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid upon this ſubject, is, I hope, intelligible, at leaſt. Some of the modern writers upon Ancient Muſic are deficient in point of perſpicuity, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom give the attentive reader inſtruction, without giving him the head-ach along with it.</p>
               <p>The MODERN <hi>muſical language</hi> or <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> as expreſſed by our <hi>notation,</hi> is perhaps of all languages the moſt true and exact, and liable to the feweſt defects, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities, and ambiguities; and if the time of <hi>grave, adagio, largo,</hi> &amp;c. could be equally aſcertained, nothing would be wanting to make it complete. But that is a point which you have taken into conſideration, p. 108, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to you I leave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0666900500:154"/>
The TUNES which were played to <hi>odes</hi> like thoſe of <hi>Horace,</hi> muſt have been plain and ſimple, becauſe of the ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the ſame ſtanza, and becauſe of the <hi>quantity</hi> of the ſyllables, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch was not to be violated, or at leaſt, not greatly, by the Muſic. The modern muſicians who have attempted to ſet ſuch Latin or Greek <hi>odes</hi> to Muſic, have often too much neglected this rule of ſuiting the <hi>tune</hi> to the <hi>metre,</hi> and have made <hi>long</hi> ſyllables <hi>ſhort,</hi> and <hi>ſhort</hi> ſyllables <hi>long,</hi> and run <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions</hi> upon ſingle ones, and repeated ſome of the words.</p>
               <p>In modern <hi>vocal Muſic</hi> we regard not this law, but perpetually ſacrifice the <hi>quantity</hi> to the <hi>modulation;</hi> which yet ſurely is a fault: but the fault is partly, if not principally, in our language, a language harſh, and unmuſical, and full of <hi>conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> and of ſyllables <hi>long</hi> by <hi>poſition.</hi> Thus in the ALEXIS of Dr. <hi>Pepuſch,</hi> a very fine <hi>cantata,</hi> you have;
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Charm-ing—ſounds—that—ſweet-ly—lan-guiſh,</hi> &amp;c.</l>

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0666900500:155"/>
Theſe ſyllables, according to the laws of <hi>proſody,</hi> are all long, except the ſixth. In the Muſic you have a <hi>demi-quaver</hi> to the firſt ſyllable, a <hi>demi-quaver</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, a <hi>quaver</hi> to the third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſinger is obliged to ſhorten long ſyllables, as well as he can.</p>
               <p>To judge of our language in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, you may compare an Engliſh <hi>heroic</hi> verſe, with a <hi>ſupernumerary</hi> foot, to a Greek <hi>iambic.</hi>

probably find in it ſomething to commend, and ſomething to cenſure.

                  <hi>Plato</hi> frequently declares, that no inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations ought to be allowed in Muſic.

It may be collected from this, that the fingers of the left hand were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in ſome manner upon the ſtrings; elſe, barely to hold a lyre, ſhewed no very free uſe of the left hand: and it appears from <hi>Ptolemy</hi> ii. 12. that they uſed bothhands
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0666900500:167"/>
at once in playing upon the lyre, and that the fingers of the left were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, not in ſtopping, but in ſtriking the ſtrings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> alſo obſerves that <hi>practical</hi> Muſic, or the art of playing in tune, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, is a conjectural ſkill, grounded on long practice and habit, but not capable of certainty and infallibility: for arts, ſays he, conſiſt in a great meaſure in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and conjecture, rather than in fixed rules.</p>

               <p>As the organs of the Ancients had many pipes and keys; ſo their lyres or harps had many ſtrings, as fifteen, twenty, ſome ſay thirty, and more. If their lyre is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in old monuments as having only four or five, or ſeven ſtrings, that ſeems to have been done (as <hi>Voſſius</hi> obſerves), part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to repreſent the lyre, as it was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, and in its ſtate of infancy.</p>
               <p>One would think that an ancient muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who was well acquainted with <hi>concords</hi> and <hi>diſcords,</hi> who had an inſtrument of many ſtrings or many keys to play upon, and two hands and ten fingers to make uſe of, would try experiments, and would

               <p>AT the end of the Oxford edition of <hi>Aratus,</hi> &amp;c. there are ſome learned obſervations on the Ancient Muſic, by <hi>Chilmead,</hi> and a few fragments of ancient tunes to ſome Greek odes and hymns, reduced to our modern <hi>notation.</hi>

               <p>It came into my mind that I had peruſed them long ago, and upon looking now into the book, I find two remarks of the editor, agreeing with my own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; one, that the <hi>time</hi> of the muſical notes anſwered to the <hi>quantity</hi> of the ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables; the other, that the Muſic of the Ancients was very plain and unadorned.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I THANK you for the expedition with which you tranſmitted to me the remarks on my eſſay. I have, in return, ſent you a ſhort defence of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt this virulent, though, I flatter myſelf, not formidable, antagoniſt.</p>
               <p>If, after looking over theſe papers, you ſhould think that they may ſerve to rectify the judgements of ſuch perſons as this writer may probably have miſled, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you would ſend them to the preſs.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, from the advertiſement of my remarker, I apprehended ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſeverity; and, notwithſtanding he called himſelf a gentleman, I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared myſelf for the worſt. My expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation has, indeed, been fully anſwered:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0666900500:180"/>
inſtead of the gentleman, the critic, the candid muſician; his pamphlet has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him to be a vain, diſappointed, ſnarling doctor<note n="a" place="bottom">This (were other reaſons wanting) may, I think, ſafely be concluded, from the pains he takes to make his readers underſtand that D ſtands for Doctor. See his Catalogue of <hi>Antient Engliſh Muſicians.</hi> Rem. p. 52.</note> of the ſcience.</p>
               <p>He begins, I think, with a pretty high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown compliment upon the ſtyle of my Eſſay, and ſays, that it is writ in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage not unworthy of our beſt proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writers; nay, he adds alſo, that the perſon who drew up the Preface to my Concertos muſt be capable of giving ſenſible thoughts on other branches of Muſic<note n="b" place="bottom">The writer of the <hi>Remarks</hi> is ſuppoſed to have alluded to the late Mr. Aviſon's ingenious friend Dr. Brown, author of the <hi>Eſſays on Ld. Shaftſbury's Characteriſtics.</hi>—The foregoing <hi>Letter concerning the Muſic of the Ancients</hi> was written by the learned Dr. Jortin.</note>. But why all this panegyric? only to introduce this very candid inſinuation, that I am but the <hi>nominal author</hi> of both one and the other.</p>
               <p>To reply to the man himſelf, or to offer to clear myſelf of this ridiculous
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0666900500:181"/>
charge, I think very much beneath me. But I will obſerve to <hi>you,</hi> that when I had determined to publiſh ſome thoughts on the ſubject of Muſic, by way of Preface to my laſt Concertos, I found my firſt deſign, of writing directions to performers only, grew ſo much upon my hands, that I could not reſiſt the temptation, however unequal to the taſk, or extending them alſo to the practice of compoſition. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus attempted a province of writing which was new to me, I thought I could not engage in it with too much caution; and, therefore, had recourſe to my learned friends, by whoſe advice I was induced to ſeparate that part which related to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of full Muſic, and to publiſh the whole together afterwards, under the title of <hi>An Eſſay on Muſical Expreſſion;</hi> and am proud to embrace this opportunity of acknowledging the generous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which thoſe gentlemen of integrity and genius ſhewed it. <hi>So far,</hi> our critic has wiſely conjectured, it was the work of a <hi>Junto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0666900500:182"/>
But to ſpeak of the Eſſay itſelf. The plan it was formed upon was of a ſingular kind. It had nothing to do with the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oretic principles, and the mere mechaniſm of the ſcience. Its aim was widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Intended, indeed, as a critical, but yet as a liberal, examen of this pleaſing art; according to rules, not drawn from the formal ſchools of ſyſtematical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, but from the ſchool of nature and good ſenſe.</p>
               <p>You will eaſily perceive, that to the execution of ſuch a plan, nothing was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary but a good ear, and a taſte culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by frequent hearing of Muſic. It was only writing on harmony, as many men, who never handled a pencil, have written upon colouring; and as many, who never penned a ſtanza, have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon metre<note n="b" place="bottom">The ABBÉ DU BOS, whom the remarker has deigned to quote, on a matter that required ſome taſte in Muſic, was unfortunately of this ſpecies of writers.

writers of this claſs may be found, whoſe works are held in as high eſteem, as if they had been compoſed by the moſt able practical profeſſors.</p>
               <p>To give an inſtance or two (if our critic will pardon the learning of it); there is not, nor perhaps ever was, a ſingle verſe extant from the pen of LONGINUS; and yet his critical taſte is as univerſally allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that of HORACE himſelf.

               <p>If then the genius of this ſort of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm is univerſally ſuch, that, having taſte, not practice, for its object, it is directed to <hi>improve</hi> the <hi>manner,</hi> not <hi>teach</hi> the <hi>mechaniſm,</hi> of any ſcience; I ſee no reaſon why a critical enquirer into the merits of my eſſay, ſhould think it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0666900500:184"/>
his buſineſs firſt to examine the merits of my muſical compoſitions. Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe compoſitions to be as bad as our Doctor would make them, I am then but in the caſe of thoſe writers whom Mr <hi>Pope</hi> ſomewhere mentions:
<q>
                     <l>"Rules for good verſe, they firſt with pains recite;</l>
                     <l>"Then ſhew us what is bad by what they write."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr <hi>Pope</hi> has ſaid in another place,
<q>
                     <l>"Let ſuch teach others who themſelves excel,</l>
                     <l>"And cenſure freely who have written well."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This our ſage remarker looked upon as an univerſal axiom, that would ſerve his purpoſe excellently, and accordingly planted it in his title-page, ſuppoſing that the poet thought none had a right to criticiſe, but ſuch as were acknowledged to be good writers; whereas, he meant by it only, that criticiſm, from an allowed artiſt, came with additional force and luſtre; and ſo undoubtedly it does. Yet,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0666900500:185"/>
to do my author juſtice, he preſently runs from his text himſelf; for, in the very 4th page, he is of opinion, that a perſon would be beſt qualified to write upon this ſubject, who had not only <hi>not written well,</hi> but who had not <hi>written at all,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided only, that this perſon was a man of fortune, like his friend Sir <hi>Humphrey Daſh.</hi> If you aſk the reaſon, he will tell you, <q rend="inline">"that to be ſure Sir Humphrey's large eſtate would give a ſanction, and perhaps command a deference to his opinion."</q> A very gentlemanly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection truly!</p>
               <p>But why muſt this rich Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> be the only licenſed critic? And why muſt a profeſſor, <hi>though even of the bigheſt rank,</hi> not be admitted? No, he will reply, by no means; <q rend="inline">"becauſe, in ſome reſpect or other, the world will think him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in it; and will very eaſily be perſuaded, that whatever degree of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem his <hi>works</hi> or <hi>abilities</hi> may ſtand in their opinion, yet, that in his own, they are placed much higher."</q>

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0666900500:186"/>
Thus, it is evident, that his ſole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection lay againſt the author of the eſſay, and not the eſſay itſelf; and had I not ſet my name to it, it is more than probable the public would not have been favoured with his curious remarks; and, for this reaſon chiefly, he has been inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to level all his ſpleen againſt my character, as a compoſer: nor has he thought it ſufficient to <hi>vilify</hi> the work he has <hi>given me,</hi> but he muſt <hi>rob</hi> me of <hi>that</hi> which he could not hope to <hi>vilify.</hi> An unparalleled favour indeed! and, no doubt, perſonally intended<note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <p>There is a malevolence among ſome profeſſors of the harmonic art, from which no diſtance of time or country can ſecure even the moſt deſerving in their own profeſſion. Their contemporaries they treat as rivals to their intereſt; and the works and cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racters of thoſe that are gone before, they conſider as obſtructions to their fame.</p>
                     <p>We cannot otherwiſe account for that wilful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or affectation in ſome maſters, who have been weak, or rather envious enough, to propagate a ridiculous notion, that CORELLI was indebted to another compoſer for the ſetting of his baſſes. Can any thing be imagined ſo abſurd as this ſuppoſition? For the nature and method of muſical compoſition is well known to be ſuch, that, whoever this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary coadjutor of CORELLI may have been, theſe ſhallow defamers might have ſpread their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities much more conſiſtently, had they attributed the conſtruction of the whole to this wondrous unknown.</p>

I think I have already reduced my antagoniſt's method of proceeding, to its firſt principles, <hi>viz.</hi> to perſonal pique and reſentment; and have ſhewn, that had he ſucceeded in his malevolent attempt;—had he proved my compoſitions as execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as <hi>ſome</hi> that have echoed through univerſity theatres; had he done even this, it would ſcarce have affected the character of my eſſay.</p>
               <p>I will now endeavour to ſhew, that the compoſitions themſelves, are not quite ſo blameable as this muſical Drawcanſir would make them.</p>
               <p>His firſt critique, and, I think, his maſter-piece, contains many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, but falſe and virulent remarks on the firſt <hi>allegro</hi> of theſe concertos, to which he ſuppoſes I would give the name of <hi>fugue.</hi> Be it juſt what he pleaſes to call it. I ſhall not defend what the public is

already in poſſeſſion of; the public being the moſt proper judge. I ſhall only here obſerve, that our critic has wilfully, or ignorantly, confounded the terms <hi>fugue</hi> and <hi>imitation,</hi> which latter is by no means ſubject to the ſame laws with the former.</p>
               <p>There are many irregular ſubjects which may often be introduced into mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical compoſitions; and, when any of theſe are <hi>imitated,</hi> or <hi>reverſed,</hi> a good ear will aſcertain their <hi>proper anſwers,</hi> beyond any rules whatever: for the principles of harmony, which particularly direct the method of anſwering a complete and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſubject, would carry the anſwers of many others, of a ſubordinate kind, into an extraneous modulation. Therefore, ſuch ſubjects ought only to be imitated; and the diſtances, in this caſe, are no otherwiſe to be conſidered, than as they may beſt agree with the <hi>mode,</hi> or <hi>key,</hi> in which they are employed, or that which is next to follow; neither is it neceſſary that their <hi>intervals</hi> ſhould be confined to

               <p>Before I leave this part of my ſubject, I ſhall quote two authorities; the firſt of which, I make no doubt, our critic will acknowledge as authentic, ſince it comes from the ſame noble author, whoſe <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe on Harmony</hi> he has himſelf, in his poſtſcript, ſo particularly recommended to my peruſal.</p>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">
                     <p>"Deſign, in Muſic, is, in general, the ſubject of all that the compoſer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; for a ſkilful compoſer is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to himſelf, a movement, a key, or mode, a melody, and an harmony, agreeable to the ſubject he would treat.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0666900500:192"/>
But this term is to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly adapted to a certain melody, which he would have predominant in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of a piece, either for making it ſuitable and agreeable to the ſenſe of the words, or for fancy or taſte; and, in that caſe, it is diſtinguiſhed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, in imitation, and in fugue.</p>
                     <p>"Imitation hath no particular merit that deſerves our attention; it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only by repeating, at pleaſure, and in any of the parts, a certain continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of melody, <hi>without any other regularity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Fugue, as well as imitation, conſiſts in a certain continuance of melody, which may be repeated at pleaſure, and in any of the parts, <hi>but with more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection,</hi> according to the following rules.</p>
                     <p>"If, in imitation, we may repeat the melody of one or more bars, and even the air entirely in one, or in all the parts, <hi>and upon whatever chords we think proper;</hi> on the contrary, in

fugues, the melody muſt alternatively be heard in the two principal parts, which are the treble and the baſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, inſtead of the treble we chuſe another part; and, if the piece contains many parts, it will be more perfect, when the fugue is heard alternatively in each part. Again, <hi>the chords that muſt be therein uſed, do not depend upon our choice</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus much may be ſufficient to ſhew, that all our critic's depth of learning, on the ſubject of muſical compoſition, muſt be of ancient date only, ſince the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the moderns, both in <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>theory,</hi> have rendered quite obſolete many of thoſe rigid laws, which only fetter the genius of thoſe who would truly embelliſh their art.</p>
               <p>By depriving the compoſer of the liberty of changing, or diverſifying his ſubject, his piece, with frequent repetitions of the very ſame thought, would be extremely languid and tedious: whereas, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0666900500:194"/>
his firſt ſubject with others, and theſe are relative to their principal, in point of <hi>air;</hi> and, with regard to their <hi>imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> are chiefly conducted by the rules of <hi>modulation;</hi> an allegro of this kind will have infinitely more ſpirit and variety, than either the lifeleſs <hi>counterpoint,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning <hi>reverſe</hi> of throwing the air into one part only. What the compoſer hath chiefly to obſerve in this conduct betwixt the extremes, is, a ſpecial regard to the chuſing thoſe ſubjects only, which may naturally be connected, as well in their <hi>modulation</hi> as <hi>harmony,</hi> and are capable of preſerving a ſimilar air (or diſcourſe, if the critic will admit) to the concluſion of his piece.</p>
               <p>This method of introducing <hi>the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental ſubjects,</hi> in a muſical compoſition, may be handled like the like under-cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in a dramatic performance; which, though the poet intends not that they ſhould ever eclipſe his heroe, or principal, he will nevertheleſs make natural and ſtriking; and it often happens, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0666900500:195"/>
though they are neceſſary to the ſupport of his fable, they do but juſt appear, and no more is heard of them.</p>
               <p>It is frequent, with the beſt compoſers of church-muſic, to introduce a new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at every change of the words. An attempt of this nature, in the inſtrumental way, has given our critic much offence; which, I ſuppoſe, he has conſidered as too bold an innovation upon the good old laws of harmony: or did he think it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on the privilege of vocal Muſic, and that no other ſhould preſume to aim at ſenſe, or the expreſſion of any affection of the mind?</p>
               <p>In his reflections, on the method of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the tenor, he makes a ſtrange pother about Muſic in four parts; when, in fact, there is no ſuch thing. The <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,</hi> it is true, will admit of four parts; but, as the ear cannot reſt on theſe alone, therefore, in every compoſition, they muſt have their <hi>preparations</hi> and <hi>reſolutions</hi> by <hi>concords,</hi> which, on that account, will have the greateſt ſhare in the conſtruction
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0666900500:196"/>
of the harmony; otherwiſe, it cannot be called Muſic: hence then, as it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to find any <hi>concord,</hi> that can admit of more than three different notes; ſo, ſtrictly ſpeaking, there can be but three parts in any muſical compoſition, ſince whatever number may be added to theſe, they are no more than either <hi>uniſons</hi> or <hi>octaves</hi> to their principals.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here take occaſion to obſerve, by way of information to my critic, that notwithſtanding a piece of Muſic is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in four parts, yet it does not follow that every <hi>chord,</hi> or every <hi>accented part</hi> of the harmony, ſhould, therefore, have <hi>four notes,</hi> or even <hi>three</hi> in many caſes. This kind of fullneſs is not always required, becauſe it often happens, that the <hi>tenor,</hi> or any other <hi>part,</hi> being either an <hi>octave</hi> or <hi>uniſon</hi> with the <hi>baſs,</hi> or with <hi>each other,</hi> will produce a more pleaſing effect than when <hi>otherwiſe accompanied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On this ſcore, however, our critic has ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned the taſte of MARCELLO, as forming his <hi>choruſes</hi> upon the uniſons of the <hi>ſolo,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0666900500:197"/>
or <hi>principal parts;</hi> and thence prefers, on all occaſions, the harmonical compoſitions of <hi>four parts;</hi> not reflecting on thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which the ſenſible compoſer may aſſign for exerting his genius in <hi>either</hi> of theſe methods; and which MARCELLO very happily has diſtinguiſhed, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious variety of movements that are in the work of his Pſalms. But this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind critic, though he owns his intimacy with them all, could only ſee thoſe which he thought he might abuſe, and abuſe merely becauſe they were contrary to his groveling taſte.</p>
               <p>What offers next, is the wonderful ſtreſs he has laid on ſome trifling diſallowances:—a mean kind of critique on the art of Muſic; as theſe are errors which may eſcape the moſt painful corrections, and may be found in the works of the moſt accurate compoſers. I had almoſt ſaid, it is more than probable our critic may find them in his own.
<q>
                     <l>"Unfiniſh'd things, one knows not what to call,</l>
                     <l>"Their generation's ſo equivocal."</l>

It were, therefore, impoſſible to retaliate his friendly advice, by any minute ſurvey of ſuch unmeaning attempts in compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Perhaps too it might prove an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary taſk, having already ſufficiently deſcribed them in the chapter on modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; from which he has tranſcribed an entire paragraph, with ſuch ſenſibility of reſentment, as makes me ſuſpect he was conſcious of ſomewhat he could not bear<note n="g" place="bottom">See Eſſay, p. 33. and Remarks, p. 37.</note>.</p>
               <p>In return for this mortification, it ſeems as if he had vowed revenge, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to allow me, even the very firſt principles of thorough baſs. But, in the fury of his charge, he hath diſarmed himſelf; for, he either does not know, or, at leaſt, is unwilling to acknowledge, that there are many liberties allowable in muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal compoſition, as well as in other arts: and eſpecially, in many caſes, that two, or more, perfect chords of the ſame kind, may not only be diſpenſed with for the ſake of ſome remarkable air or expreſſion in any <hi>one part,</hi> but that they may even
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0666900500:199"/>
be produced to give a very pleaſing effect from <hi>many parts</hi> together.</p>
               <p>The method of initiating pupils in Muſic, into a thorough knowledge of the rules of <hi>accompanyment,</hi> and the various <hi>preparations</hi> and <hi>reſolutions</hi> of <hi>diſcords,</hi> is neceſſary to explain what is proper to be done in this branch of art; yet it is not ſufficient to ſhew him <hi>all</hi> that may be done. <hi>Nature</hi> is ſtill ſuperior to <hi>art:</hi> and, as the firſt principles of all ſcience were primarily deduced from nature, and have been brought, by ſlow degrees, to their preſent perfection; ſo, we may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conclude, theſe improvements may yet be carried higher.</p>
               <p>In Muſic, there are expreſs laws relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>modulation,</hi> as well as to <hi>harmony;</hi> yet, if all compoſers indiſcriminately were confined to theſe laws, we ſhould ſoon ſee an end of all taſte, ſpirit, and variety in their compoſitions: and I don't know whether, by this means, we ſhould not be deprived of one of the ſtrongeſt efforts of

               <p>To inſtance one of this kind will be ſufficient.

               <p>As to the errors of two <hi>perfect chords</hi> of the ſame kind, I will confeſs to him, that I am ſo hardened a ſinner, on certain occaſions, againſt <hi>his</hi> John Trott laws, that I have more than once intentionally offended; and if he cannot perceive the reaſon, it will ſcarce be worth while to inform him.</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs to offer the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remark, on the whole of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.—The modulation in a <hi>flat key,</hi> it is well known, is very different from <hi>that</hi> in the <hi>ſharp key;</hi> the <hi>former</hi> being the ſame, whether you aſcend or deſcend; whereas, if you aſcend in the <hi>latter,</hi> the <hi>ſixth</hi> muſt be <hi>ſharp,</hi> though it is <hi>flat</hi> in deſcending: hence, the <hi>falſe fifth,</hi> and even the <hi>tritone,</hi> cannot always be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is, therefore, to this imperfection in the <hi>ſcale of Muſic,</hi> you muſt impute the C <hi>ſharp</hi> in the <hi>tenor,</hi> and the omiſſion of not figuring <hi>that ſharp</hi> in the <hi>baſs.</hi>—And this is the cauſe of our critic's aſſigning,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0666900500:210"/>
to the above example, the worſt ſinging he ever heard. Nevertheleſs, theſe falſe relations are allowable in <hi>quick move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and may be found in the very beſt compoſitions: but in <hi>ſlow movements,</hi> where they can neither be <hi>accented,</hi> nor even made <hi>paſſing notes,</hi> they are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſagreeable; and it ſeems, indeed, as if our critic had treated this diſſonant <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone</hi> in a very ſolemn way, having, no doubt, tried and re-tried it upon his harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſichord, till dwelling on the diſcord might ſufficiently raiſe his ſpleen for the buſineſs he had undertaken<note n="l" place="bottom">

How then can this <hi>unaccented, unaccompanied,</hi> and <hi>ſwift-paſſing note</hi> be ſuppoſed to prepare the <hi>diſcord?</hi>—Then judge, ye candid compoſers, whether this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling critic might not bluſh at ſo unfair a charge, did he not wear a maſk to hide his ſhame?</p>

               <p>The cloſe of his paragraph, on this head, may be quoted as a ſample of his prodigious ſagacity in making diſcoveries.

The fourth example contains a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, as ſtrange as he hath repreſented the fault to be. His queſtion is,—<q rend="inline">"Pray in what part is the diſcord? I doubt not but your anſwer will be, Where the binding is."</q>—And where elſe can it be placed? And thus he proceeds,—<q rend="inline">"Why then are the figures 7 and 9 put there? For they manifeſtly make the upper parts diſcords; but then, why are they not <hi>reſolved?</hi> if the baſs be a diſcord, the ſecond maketh it ſo; and the ſeventh moſt certainly is a falſe accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</q>—To all this I anſwer, that the 7 and 9 are placed there, becauſe the baſs ſtands ſtill. For, when the parts are driving each other, and the baſs keeps its note, the accompanyments, on that account, muſt often be <hi>extraneous;</hi> and, where the <hi>taſto-ſolo,</hi> or ſtriking of one key, is not directed, the holding note ſhould be always completely figured: and thence the 7 and 9 may frequently be found together. In this caſe, every <hi>diſcord,</hi> out of the common rule of <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate-deſcant,</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0666900500:216"/>
may be conſidered as a kind of <hi>appoggiatura,</hi> or leaning note, where the <hi>diſcord</hi> is often ſtrongly expreſſed, and the ſucceeding <hi>concord</hi> but juſt drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon the ear. But this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation againſt the venerable fathers of harmony, and brought in by the <hi>Italians;</hi> I am not, therefore, ſurprized, that our orthodox critic hath exclaimed ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt it.</p>
               <p>But there is another circumſtance at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this example, which our critic was not aware of; and, with all his amazement at the ſtrangeneſs of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, he has ſhewn, if poſſible, more folly than ill-nature. If he does not know, that the work of <hi>melody</hi> may alſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, and moſt happily too, in the <hi>baſſes</hi> of muſical compoſition, I will refer him to the <hi>operas</hi> of RAMEAU, where he will find theſe <hi>appoggiaturas,</hi> and a certain melody, in the baſs, (peculiar, as yet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to this compoſer) giving the fineſt effects that can poſſibly be imagined.</p>

               <p>In the fifth example, he has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly over-looked a ſuperior deſign, which, at all events, he would ſacrifice to a ſlaviſh regard of very minute diſallowances; and as he hath particularly challenged, in this place, my audacious attempts, both as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0666900500:219"/>
a compoſer and critic, he muſt pardon me, if, therefore, I diſpute his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions in this caſe. His allegation is this.—<q rend="inline">"Suppoſe the queſtion were put to a young practitioner in thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſs, What are the proper conſequents of G <hi>ſharp</hi> in the baſs, with a <hi>ſeventh</hi> figured to it? Would not his anſwer be, The G <hi>ſharp</hi> is a plain indication, that A ſhould be the following note; and the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> which is F <hi>natural,</hi> will expect to find its <hi>reſolution</hi> in E <hi>natural?</hi>"</q>—To this, I need only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that as the queſtion is put to a <hi>learner,</hi> ſo the anſwer is ſuch as a <hi>learner</hi> only could give. But if he had put the ſame queſtion to a maſter, he would have ſhewn him, that theſe <hi>reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> may be varied many ways; and that otherwiſe it would be a vain attempt in the compoſer to produce variety in his work, ſeeing every novice might before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand ſuggeſt, when any particular chord was ſtruck, what next was to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0666900500:220"/>
In this example, our remarker hath roundly aſſerted, that the <hi>allegro</hi> preceding the <hi>adagio,</hi> No 5, is concluded with a <hi>full cadence</hi> in D with its <hi>ſharp third,</hi> in order, no doubt, to ſhew the bad effect of the ſucceeding modulation into a <hi>flat key.</hi> But this is not fact, the <hi>allegro</hi> being cloſed in the <hi>fifth</hi> of the key, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an <hi>imperfect cadence:</hi> which, like the <hi>colon</hi> in writing, leaves the ear in expectation of ſomething to follow; and, with regard to a muſical compoſition, the modulation, in that caſe, may deviate with greater freedom from the common rule<note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <p>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 5. The <hi>imperfect cadence,</hi> which forms the cloſe of the <hi>allegro,</hi> is here annexed, to ſhew that our critic miſinformed his friend, when he ſaid this <hi>allegro</hi> was concluded by a <hi>full cadence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 6. and 7. convey nothing, ſo it was thought needleſs to produce them here again.</p>
                     <p>Thus, by the appearance of theſe maimed examples in notes, (deſigned, no doubt, by ſuch <hi>ſcraps,</hi> to catch the <hi>eye,</hi> and exclude the <hi>ear</hi>) our notable projector imagined, he had fairly ſubmitted his <hi>reaſonable</hi> critique to the judgement of the public: but, may not <hi>eve</hi> too imagine in our turn, that, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of compoſition are obvious but to <hi>few,</hi> he truſted the <hi>multitude</hi> would not ſee into his flimſy objections. I have, therefore, thought it worth while, not only to clear myſelf of the injuſtice he would have done me, had it been in his power, but alſo to ſhew the impoſition he would lay on the art of Muſic itſelf, by expoſing his narrow and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced notions in compoſition.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0666900500:221"/>
The remaining examples, 6 and 7, make an excellent cloſe to his critical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks: for, whatever errors they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhew; no perſon, unacquainted with the movement from whence they are taken, can form any juſt notion about them. If they are deſigned as ſpecimens of the compoſer's contrivance, the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic has, indeed, acted conſiſtently to the laſt; becauſe, if in theſe, and his other examples, he had produced the ſeveral pieces entire, to which they belong, this ingenuous method might not ſo well have anſwered his determined purpoſe of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Perhaps, he was aware of this; for, notwithſtanding he hath aſſured his friend, that he had not ſcored <hi>all</hi> the <hi>concertos,</hi> we are not ſworn to believe him; nor can I otherwiſe infer, from the nature of his
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0666900500:222"/>
Remarks, but that his ſole intention was, a ſeeking of errors; I ſhall, therefore, leave him with this frank confeſſion, which I have borrowed from EPICTETUS, (which he may alſo call an <hi>affectation of learning,</hi> if he pleaſes) that if he were as intimate with the faults of theſe <hi>concertos,</hi> as I am, he would find a great many more.</p>
               <p>Thus I have gone regularly through all the objections which this doughty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt has been pleaſed to raiſe againſt theſe <hi>concertos.</hi> But I fancy I ſhall be eaſily excuſed from taking the ſame pains with his coarſe and wordy comment on the Eſſay itſelf, in which, like a true polemic, he has laid down but one rule or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of writing, namely, to oppoſe, at all events, whatever I had advanced, and to pervert every plain paſſage, which, even ſo perverted, he had not talents to confute.</p>
               <p>To give one inſtance.—The heat of his rage ſeems to be kindled at the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front which he would inſinuate I have put upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> compoſers. And to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0666900500:223"/>
draw their ſevereſt reſentment upon me, he hath alſo as falſely inſinuated that I have equally injured the great original which they have imitated.</p>
               <p>Then he produces the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.—<q rend="inline">"The <hi>Italians</hi> ſeem particularly indebted to the variety and invention of SCARLATTI; and <hi>France</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a RAMEAU, equal, if not ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, to LULLY. The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as yet, indeed, have not been ſo ſucceſsful: but whether this may be owing to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority in the original they have choſe to imitate, or to a want of genius, in thoſe that are his imitators (in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, perhaps, not the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of his works) it is not neceſſary here to determine<note n="q" place="bottom">See Eſſay, p. 48.</note>."</q>—This he calls a ſaucy inſinuation. But ſaucy to whom? If to his Doctorſhip only, I am entirely unconcerned about it. But if to Mr. HANDEL, I would be the firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, and eraſe it from my Eſſay: this, however, I believe, none but our
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0666900500:224"/>
critic will ſuſpect; though every one will eaſily perceive his reaſon for quoting and perverting it, <hi>viz.</hi> to take off the odium from ſuch meagre compoſers as himſelf, and to throw it all upon the character of Mr. HANDEL.</p>
               <p>I could wiſh to know whence this unnatural conjunction comes, and what Mr. HANDEL has done, that he deſerves to be treated with that air of familiarity which our author puts on, when he calls him his <note n="r" place="bottom">See the Remarks, p. 62.</note>brother.—<hi>Poor Doctor!</hi> I know not what tables of affinity or conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity can prove you even his couſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german. Is Mr. HANDEL an <hi>Engliſhman?</hi> is his very name <hi>Engliſh?</hi> was his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>Engliſh?</hi> was he not firſt educated in the <hi>Italian</hi> ſchool? did he not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and direct the <hi>Italian</hi> operas here many years? It is true, he has ſince deigned to ſtrengthen the delicacy of the <hi>Italian</hi> air, ſo as to bear the rougher ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of our language. But to call him, on that account, brother to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0666900500:225"/>
as our <hi>Doctor,</hi> I am perſuaded, is an appellation, that he would reject with the contempt it deſerves.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to my countrymen, I thought I had ſhewn a very high regard to their genius and abilities, when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prove, that, by an unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced intercourſe with the world in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and by a right application of their own natural good ſenſe, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might undoubtedly receive, and <hi>improve</hi> thoſe advantages, which other nations had experienced from a like conduct; and, without which, no diſtinct people of themſelves, and no profeſſors in any art whatever, can expect to excel.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, our ſanguine critic has treated this impartiality, as relinquiſhing the merits of my own countrymen; nor will he be ſatisfied with any thing leſs than a plenary acknowledgement, that they are not only ſuperior to all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in their muſical abilities, but, in all former times, have deſerved the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence.—Such a poſition muſt ſurely
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0666900500:226"/>
ſeem falſe, and highly abſurd to all judges, who eſteem it a virtue to be <hi>national,</hi> but not to be <hi>bigoted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is the indelible ſtamp of mean and trifling ſpirits, to envy and depreciate the talents of thoſe whom they vainly ſtrive to rival.—To this we may juſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the falſe odium which ſome have endeavoured to throw on this nation, as an encourager of foreign artiſts.—Can any thing redound more to its real glory? does not this generous regard to merit, of whatever country, ſpread the name and genius of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the moſt diſtant climes, and render them an honour to human nature?</p>
               <p>With regard to Muſic, had we been left to ourſelves, without the leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with other nations, it is hard to ſay what might have been the reigning taſte. If we may judge from the high claims of thoſe profeſſors, who contemptuouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all foreign improvements, I am afraid we ſhould have had no great cauſe to boaſt of any ſuperior excellence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0666900500:227"/>
Yet, perhaps, I may be miſtaken; had this been the caſe, it is not improbable but (as the names of HANDEL, BONON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINI, GEMINIANI, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had then never been heard of) our Doctor would have reigned, at preſent, ſupreme over our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical kingdom, and proved his hereditary right by a lineal deſcent from his <hi>great fore-father</hi> Doctor BULL<note n="s" place="bottom">The following extract from the <hi>Faſti Oxon.</hi> will, I apprehend, entertain the reader; as at once giving him a character of this <hi>famous Doctor,</hi> and an idea of the taſte of that ſort of Muſic, which our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker ſo highly applauds. <q rend="inline">"JOHN BULL, (that prodigy of a man, ſee Remarks on the Eſſay, p. 54.) who had practiſed the faculty of Muſic for 14 years, was then admitted bachelor of Muſic.—This perſon, who had a moſt prodigious hand on the organ, and was famous throughout the religious world, for his church Muſic, (the words of ſome of which are extant) had been trained up under an excellent maſter, named BLITHMAN, organiſt of queen ELIZABETH's chapel, who died much lamented in 1591. This BLITHMAN, perceiving that he had a natural geny to the faculty, ſpared neither time nor labour to advance it to the utmoſt. So that, in ſhort time, he being more than maſter of it, which he ſhewed by his moſt admirable compoſitions, played and ſung in many churches beyond the ſeas, as well as at home, he took occaſion to go <hi>incognito</hi> into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> At length, hearing of a famous muſician, belonging to a certain cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, (at St. <hi>Omer's,</hi> as I have heard) he applied himſelf as a novice to him, to learn ſomething of his faculty, and to ſee and admire his works. This muſician, after ſome diſcourſe had paſſed between them, conducted BULL to a <hi>veſtry,</hi> or Muſic ſchool, joining to the cathedral, and ſhewed to him a <hi>leſſon</hi> or <hi>ſong of forty parts,</hi> and then made a vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing challenge to any perſon in the world to add one more part to them, ſuppoſing it to be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and full, that it was impoſſible for any mortal to correct, or add to it. BULL, thereupon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the uſe of ink and ruled paper, (ſuch as we call muſical paper) prayed the muſician to lock him up in the ſaid ſchool for 2 or 3 hours; which being done, not without great diſdain by the muſician, BULL, in that time, or leſs, added <hi>forty more parts</hi> to the ſaid <hi>leſſon</hi> or <hi>ſong.</hi> The muſician, thereupon, being called in, he viewed it, tried it, and re-tried it. At length he burſt out into a great ectaſy, and ſwore by the great God, that <hi>he that added thoſe forty parts, muſt either be the devil, or Dr. Bull,</hi> &amp;c."</q>—But, which of theſe eminent perſonages had the greateſt ſhare in this wonderful performance, we are not able to determine, ſeeing it hath periſhed in the wreck of time, from which, not even all its fourſcore parts could defend it. Nevertheleſs, the fame of theſe great muſical deeds hath lived in the records of <hi>Parnaſſus;</hi> and, no doubt but our critic, by his vicinity to that happy manſion, hath already in view, the diſtant eminence of being enrolled among thoſe chiefs who have done ſuch wonders.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0666900500:228"/>
Having placed our Doctor on his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0666900500:229"/>
throne in this ideal kingdom, I very reſpectfully take my leave of him.—But, in a ſentence or two more, I will beg leave to deliver my ſentiments of Mr. HANDEL, which, I am ſure, will contradict nothing I have ſaid in my Eſſay; and, I flatter myſelf, will be aſſented to by the <hi>rational</hi> part of our muſical judges.</p>
               <p>Mr. HANDEL is, in Muſic, what his own DRYDEN was in poetry; nervous, exalted, and harmonious; but voluminous, and, conſequently, not always correct. Their abilities equal to every thing; their execution frequently inferior. Born with genius capable of <hi>ſoaring the boldeſt flights;</hi> they have ſometimes, to ſuit the vitiated taſte of the age they lived in, <hi>deſcended to the loweſt.</hi> Yet, as both their excellencies are infinitely more numerous than their deficiencies, ſo both their characters will devolve to lateſt poſterity, not as models of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet glorious examples of thoſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0666900500:230"/>
amazing powers that actuate the human ſoul.</p>
