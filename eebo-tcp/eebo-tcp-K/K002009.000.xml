            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO MR. BEARD.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is with great pleaſure I embrace this opportunity to
acknowledge the favours I have received from you. Among others I would mention
in particular the warmth with which you eſpouſed this piece in its
paſſage to the ſtage; but that I am afraid it would be thought a
compliment to your good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, too much at the expence of your
judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If this Opera is conſidered merely as a piece of Dramatic
writing, it will certainly be found to have very little merit: in that light no
one can think more indifferently of it than I do myſelf; but I believe I may
venture to aſſert, on your opinion, that ſome of the ſongs are
tollerable; that the muſic is more pleaſing than has hitherto appeared in
any compoſition of this kind; and the words better adapted, conſidering the
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the airs, which are not common bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads, than could be expected,
ſuppoſing any degree of poetry to be preſerved in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification.
More than this few people expect, in an Opera, and if ſome of the ſeverer
cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics ſhould be inclined to blame your indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to one of the firſt
attempts of a young writer, I am perſuaded the Public in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <pb facs="tcp:0100200200:3"/> will applaud your endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them with ſomething new, in
a ſpecies of entertainment, in which the performers at your Theatre ſo
eminently excel.</p>
            <p>You may perceive Sir, that I yield a punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obſervance to the
injunctions you laid upon me, when I threatened you with this addreſs, and
make it rather a preface than a dedication: And yet I muſt confeſs I can
hardly reconcile thoſe formalities which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it indelicate to pay
praiſes where all the world allows them to be due; nor can I eaſily
conceive why a man ſhould be ſo ſtudious to deſerve, what he does not
deſire: But ſince you will not allow me to offer any panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric to you, I
muſt haſten to beſtow one upon myſelf, and let the public know (which
was my chief deſign in this intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction) that I have the honor to be,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>

for you—Why Sir I have not been in bed five minutes after ſun-riſe
theſe thirty years, am generally up before it; and I never took a doſe of
phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic but once in my life, and that was in compliment to

<hi>Woodcock,</hi> you are a rich man, a man of worſhip, a juſtice of
peace, and all that; but learn to know the reſpect that is due to the ſound
from the infirm; and allow me the ſuperiority a good conſtitution gives me
over you—Health is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all poſſeſſions, and 'tis a

                  <p>Why if I did love you, I can aſſure you, you wou'd never be
the better for it—Women are apt enough to be weak, we cannot always
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for our inclinations but it is in our power not to give way to them;
and if I was ſo ſilly; I ſay, if I <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0100200200:42"/> was ſo
indiſcreet, which I hope I am not, as to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an improper regard, when
people's circumſtances are quite unſuitable, and there are obſtacles in

melancholy with him.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>WELL this is excellent, this is mighty good, this is mighty
merry faith, ha, ha, ha; was ever the like heard of? that my boy <hi>Tom</hi>
ſhould run away from me, for fear of being forced to marry a girl he never
ſaw; that ſhe ſhould ſcamper from her father, for fear of being forced
to marry him; and that they ſhould run into one another's arms this way in
diſguiſe; by mere aocident; againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and without
knowing it as a body may ſay: may I never do an ill turn maſter
<hi>Hawthorn,</hi> if it is not one of the oddeſt adventures
partly—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hawth.</speaker>
                  <p>Why Sir <hi>William</hi> it is romance, a novel, a pleaſanter
hiſtory by half, than the loves of <hi>Doraſtus</hi> and <hi>Faunia</hi>;
we ſhall have ballads made of it within theſe two months, ſetting forth,
how a young 'ſquire became a ſerving man of low degree: and it will be
ſtuck up with <hi>Margret's</hi> ghoſt, and the Spaniſh lady, againſt
the walls of every cottage in the country.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>But what pleaſes me beſt of all maſter <hi>Hawthorn,</hi>
is the ingenuity of the girl. May I never do an ill turn, when I was called out
of the room, and the ſervant ſaid ſhe wanted to ſpeak to me, if I knew
what <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0100200200:62"/> to make on't: but when the little gypſey took me
aſide, and told me her name, and how matters ſtood, I was quite
aſtoniſh'd as a body may ſay; and could not believe it partly; till her
young friend, that ſhe is with here, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me of the truth on't.
Indeed at laſt I began to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect her face, though I have not ſet eyes
on her before, ſince ſhe was the height of a full grown greyhound.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hawth.</speaker>
                  <p>Well Sir <hi>William,</hi> your ſon as yet knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of
what has happen'd, nor of your being come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if you'll follow my
council, we'll have ſome ſport with him—He and his miſtreſs were
to meet in the garden this evening by appointment, ſhe's gone to dreſs
herſelf in all her airs; will you let me direct your proceedings in this
affair.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
                  <p>With all my heart maſter <hi>Hawthorn,</hi> with all my heart,
do what you will with me, ſay what you pleaſe for me; I am ſo overjoy'd
and ſo happy—And may I never do an ill turn, but I am very glad to
ſee you too, ay, and partly as much pleaſed at that as any thing elſe,
for we have been merry together before now, when we were ſome years younger:
Well and how has the world gone with you maſter <hi>Hawthorn</hi> ſince we
ſaw one another laſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hawth.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, pretty well Sir <hi>William,</hi> I have no reaſon to
complain; every one has a mixture of four with his ſweets; but in the main I
believe I have done in a degree as tollerably as my neighbours.</p>

glazed, and hung over the parlour chimney piece, and your grandfather was

what did you propoſe to yourſelf, <hi>Tom?</hi> I know you were always fond
