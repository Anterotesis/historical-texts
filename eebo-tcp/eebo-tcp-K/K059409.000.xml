            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not unacquainted, that, ever ſince this Book was firſt promis'd by way of Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the World, it was greedily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted by a great many Perſons of any Tempers, for the ſame reaſon, that it has been condemn'd by thoſe of a more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0180400100:4"/>
formal Claſs, who thought it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated partly to introduce a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new and diverting Curioſities in the way of Superſtition, and partly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge the ſecret Intrigues and Amours of one part of the Sex, to give the other part room to make favourite Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal the Subject of their Diſcourſe; and ſo to make one half of the fair Species very merry, over the Bluſhes and the Mortifications of the other half. But when they come to read the following Sheets, they will find their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſappointed, (but I hope I may ſay too) very agreeably diſappointed. They will find a much more elegant Entertainment than they expected. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making them a Bill of Fare out of patchwork Romances of polluting Scandal; the good old Gentleman who wrote the Adventures of my Life, has made it his Buſineſs to treat them with a great variety of entertaining Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which always terminate in Morals, that tend to the Edification of all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0180400100:5"/>
of whatſoever Sex, Age, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Inſtead of ſeducing young, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, unwary Minds into the vicious delight, which is too often taken in reading the gay and bewitching Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras of the <hi>Caballiſts,</hi> and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing the inticing Fables of new-invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tricks of Superſtition, my ancient Friend, the Writer, ſtrikes at the very Root of theſe Superſtitions, and ſhews them, how they may be ſatisfy'd in their ſeveral Curioſities, by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to time, who by the Talent of the Second-ſight (which he ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repreſents, how Nature is ſo kind frequently to implant in the Minds of Men born in the ſame Climate with myſelf) can tell you thoſe things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, which when you try to learn your ſelves, you either run the Hazard of being impos'd upon in your Pockets by Cheats, Gypſies and common Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers, or elſe of being impos'd upon, in a ſtill worſe way, in your moſt laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Welfare, by having recourſe to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0180400100:6"/>
Conjurers or Inchanters that deal in Black Arts, and involve all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulters in one general Partnerſhip of their execrable Guilt; or laſtly, of impoſing worſt of all on your own ſelves, by getting into an Itch of practiſing and trying the little Tricks of Female Superſtition, which are often more officiouſly handed down, by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of credulous Nurſes and old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from one Generation to another, than the firſt Principles of Chriſtian Doctrine, which 'tis their Duty to inſtil early into little Children. But I hope when this Book comes to be pretty generally read among you La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, (as by your generous and numerous Subſcriptions, I have good reaſon to expect) that it will afford a perfect Remedy and a thorough Cure to that Diſtemper, which firſt took its Riſe from too great a Growth of Curioſity, and too large a Stock of Credulity nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed prejudicially up with you in your more tender and infant Years.</p>

Whatever young Maid hereafter has an innocent but longing Deſire to know who ſhall be her Husband, and what time ſhe ſhall be marry'd, will, I hope, when ſhe has read in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sheets of a Man that can ſet her right in the Knowledge of thoſe Points, purely by poſſeſſing the Gift of the Second-ſight, ſooner have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe innocently to ſuch a Man than uſe unlawful Means to acquire it, ſuch as running to Conjurers to have his Figure ſhewn in their inchanted Glaſſes, or uſing any of thoſe traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Superſtitions, by which they may dream of their Husbands, or cauſe viſionary Shapes of them to appear on ſuch and ſuch Feſtival Nights of the Year; all which Practiſes are not ordinarily wicked and impious, but downright diabolical. I hope that the next twenty ninth of <hi>June,</hi> which is St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's Day, I ſhall not ſee the ſeveral Paſture Fields adjacent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0180400100:8"/>
to this Metropolis, eſpecially that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <hi>Montague</hi> Houſe, throng'd, as they were the laſt Year, with well dreſt young Ladies crawling buſily up and down upon their Knees, as if they were a parcel of Weeders, when all the Buſineſs is to hunt ſuperſtitiouſly after a Coal under the Root of a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to put under their Heads that Night, that they may dream who ſhould be their Husbands. In order to ſhame them out of this ſilly but guilty Practice, I do intend to have ſome Spies out on that Day, that ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover who they are, and what they have been about; and I here give notice to the Publick, that this ill-acted Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy (if it be acted at all this Year) muſt begin according to the Rule of their Superſtition, on that Day preciſely at the Hour of Twelve. And ſo much for the pretty Weeders: But as you (Ladies) have had ſeveral Magical Traditions deliver'd to you, which, if you put in Exerciſe and Practice, will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0180400100:9"/>
be greatly prejudicial to your Honour and your Virtue; let me interpoſe my Counſels, which will conduct you inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly to the ſame end, which ſome Ladies have labour'd to arrive at by theſe Impieties. Give me leave firſt to tell you, that tho' what you aim at may be arriv'd to by theſe Means, yet theſe Means make that a miſerable Fortune which would have been a good one; becauſe in order to know human Things beforehand, you uſe preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Mediums, which deſtroy the Goodneſs of the Courſes, which Nature her ſelf was taking for you, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexes to them diabolical Influences, which commonly carry along with them Fatalities in this World as well as the next. You will therefore give me your Pardon likewiſe, Ladies, if I relate ſome other of theſe Practices, which bare relation of it ſelf, after what I have ſaid before, ſeems to me ſufficient to explode them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0180400100:10"/>
Another of the Nurſes Preſcriptions is this. Upon a St. <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Night, the 21ſt Day of <hi>January,</hi> take a Row of Pins and pull out every one, one after another, ſaying a <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or <hi>Our Father,</hi> ſticking a Pin in your Sleeve, and you will dream of her you ſhall marry. <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> in one of his Maſkes makes ſome mention of this.<q>
                  <l>And on ſweet St. <hi>Agnes</hi> Night</l>
                  <l>Pleaſe you with the promis'd ſight,</l>
                  <l>Some of Huſbands, ſome of Lovers.</l>
                  <l>Which an empty Dream diſcovers.</l>
               </q> Now what can be more infinitely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane than to uſe the Prayer of our Lord inſtituted in ſuch a way?</p>
            <p>There is another Preſcription, which is as follows: You muſt lie in another County, and knit the left Garter about the right-legg'd Stocking (let the other
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0180400100:11"/>
Garter and Stocking alone) and as you rehearſe theſe following Verſes, at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Comma knit a Knot.<q>
                  <l>This Knot I knit,</l>
                  <l>To know the thing I know not yet,</l>
                  <l>That I may ſee</l>
                  <l>The Man that ſhall my Huſband be:</l>
                  <l>How he goes, and what he wears,</l>
                  <l>And what he does all Days and Years.</l>
               </q> Accordingly in your Dream you will ſee him: If a Muſitian with a Lute or other Inſtrument; if a Scholar with a Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I appeal to you, Ladies, what a ridiculous Preſcription is this? But yet as ſlight a thing as it is, it may be of great Importance if it be brought about, becauſe then it muſt be conſtrued to be done by preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Means, and then thoſe Words are nothing leſs than an Application to the Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0180400100:12"/>
Mr. <hi>Awbrey</hi> of the Royal Society ſays, a Gentlewoman, that he knew, confeſſed in his hearing that ſhe uſed this Method, and dreamt of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band whom ſhe had never ſeen: About two or three Years after, as ſhe was one Sunday at Church, up pops a young <hi>Oxonian</hi> in the Pulpit; ſhe cries out preſently to her Siſter, this is the very Face of the Man I ſaw in my Dream. Sir <hi>William Somes</hi>'s Lady did the like.</p>
            <p>Another way is to charm the Moon thus, (as the old Nurſes give out) at the firſt Appearance of the Moon after New-years-day, (ſome ſay any other New Moon is as good) go out in the Evening, and ſtand over the Sparrs of a Gate or Stile, looking on the Moon (here remark that in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> they kneel on a Ground-faſt Stone) and ſay,<q>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0180400100:13"/>
                  <l>All hail to the Moon, all hail to thee,</l>
                  <l>I prithee good Moon reveal to me</l>
                  <l>This Night who my Huſband ſhall be.</l>
               </q> You muſt preſently after go to Bed: The aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Awbrey</hi> knew two Gentlewomen that did thus when they were young Maids, and they had Dreams of thoſe that married them.</p>
            <p>But a great many of the wittieſt part of your Sex laugh at theſe common Superſtitions; but then they are apt to run into worſe: They give themſelves up to the reading of the <hi>Cabaliſtical</hi> Syſtems of <hi>Sylphs,</hi> and <hi>Gnomes,</hi> and <hi>Mandrakes,</hi> which are very wicked and deluſive Imaginations.</p>
            <p>I would not have you imagin (La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) that I impute theſe things as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and Frailties peculiar to your Sex. No; Men, and great Men too,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0180400100:14"/>
and Scholars, and even Stateſmen and Princes themſelves have been tainted with Superſtitions; and where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Minds of ſuch great Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they make the deeper Impreſſion, according to the ſtronger and more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ideas they have of them. Their greater degree of Strength in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect only ſubjects them to greater Weakneſſes; ſuch was even the great <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> the Wonder and Miracle of Learning in the Age wherein he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuch were all his Followers, Scholars, Stateſmen, Divines, and Princes that are <hi>Taliſmaniſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Taliſmans</hi> that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> pretends to owe to the Excogitation and Invention of honeſt Art, ſeem to me to be of a very diabolical Nature, and to owe their Riſe to being dedicated by the Author to the Heathen Gods. Thus the <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> pretending to a vaſt Penetration into Arts and Sciences (tho' all their Thoughts are Chimeras and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0180400100:15"/>
Extravagancies, unleſs they be help'd by preternatural Means) ſay they have found out the ſeveral Methods appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the ſeveral Planets: They have appropriated Gold to the Sun on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> Silver to the Moon on the <hi>Monday,</hi> Iron to <hi>Mars</hi> on the <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> Quickſilver to <hi>Mercury</hi> on the Wedneſday, Tin to <hi>Jupiter</hi> on the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> Copper or Braſs to <hi>Venus</hi> on the <hi>Friday,</hi> and Lead to <hi>Saturn</hi> on the <hi>Saturday.</hi> The Methods they take in forming theſe <hi>Taliſmans</hi> are too long to dwell upon here. But the Properties which they pretend belong to them are, that the firſt <hi>Taliſman</hi> or Seal of the Sun will make a Man beloved by all Princes and Potentates, and cauſe him to abound with all the Riches his Heart can wiſh. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond preſerves Travellers from Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and is favourable to Merchants, Tradeſmen, and Workmen. The third carries Deſtruction to any place where it is put; and 'tis ſaid that a certain
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0180400100:16"/>
great Miniſter of State order'd one of theſe to be carry'd into <hi>England</hi> in the Times of the Revolution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cauſed by <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi> The fourth they pretend cures Fevers and other Diſeaſes; and if it be put under the Bolſter, it makes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor have true Dreams, in which he ſees all he deſires to know. The fifth, according to them, renders a Man lucky and fortunate in all his Buſineſſes and Undertakings.

The ſixth, by being put into the Liquor which any one drinks, reconciles mortal Enemies, makes them intimate Friends; it gains the Love of all Women, and renders the Proprietor very dextrous in the Art of Muſick. The ſeventh makes Women be eaſily brought to Bed without Pain; and if a Horſeman carries it in his left Boot, himſelf and his Horſe become invulnerable.</p>

This <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and his learned Followers ſay is owing to the Inſluence of the Stars; but I can't help argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Acts of diabolical Impiety.

Among many, a few of the moſt notorious, that I can call to mind now, are as follow. The firſt and chiefeſt of theſe miſchievous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-tellers is a Woman that does not live far from the <hi>Old Bailey.</hi> And

            <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the Writings delivered in a Hiſtorical manner to the World; none certainly were ever held in greater Eſteem than thoſe, which give us the Lives of diſtinguiſhed private Men at full length; and, as I may ſay, to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0180400100:25"/>
Life. Such curious Fragments of <hi>Biography</hi> are the Rarities, which great Men ſeek after with eager Induſtry, and, when found; prize them as the Chief Jewels and Ornaments, that enrich their Libraries: And deſervedly; for they are the Beauties of the greateſt Men's Lives handed down by way of Example or Inſtruction to Poſterity, and commonly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down likewiſe by the greateſt Men. Since therefore, Perſons diſtinguiſhed for Merit in one Kind or other, are the conſtant Subjects of ſuch Diſcourſes, and the moſt Elegant Writers of each Age have been uſually the only Authors, who chuſe upon ſuch Subjects to employ their Pens, and ſince Perſons of the higheſt Rank, and Dignity, and <hi>Genij</hi> of the moſt refined and delicate Reliſh, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently curious enough to be the Readers of them, and to eſteem them the moſt valuable Pieces in a whole Collection of Learned Works. It is a Wonder to me, that when any Man's Life has ſomething in it peculiarly Great and Remarkable in its Kind, it ſhould not move ſome more skilful Writer than my ſelf to give the Publick a Taſte of it, becauſe it muſt be at leaſt vaſtly Entertaining, if it be not, which is next to impoſſible, immenſly Inſtructive and Profitable withal.</p>
            <p>If ever the Life of any Man under the Sun was Remarkable, this Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi>'s, which I am going to treat upon, is ſo, to a very eminent Degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0180400100:26"/>
It affords ſuch variety of Incidents, and is accompanied with ſuch diverſity of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that it includes within it, what muſt yield entire Satisfaction to the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Admiration to Perſons of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Underſtanding. The Prince and the Peaſant will have their ſeveral Ends of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Delight in reading it; and Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>'s Life is of that Extent, that it concerns and collects (as I may ſay) within it ſelf eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Station of Life in the Univerſe. Beſides, There is a Demand in almoſt every Page, that relates any new Act of his, for the fineſt and cloſeſt Diſquiſitions that Learning can make upon human Nature, to account how thoſe Acts could be done by him. For he daily practiſed, and ſtill practices thoſe Things naturally, which puts Art to the rack to find out how Nature can ſo operate in him; and his fleſhly Body, by theſe Operations, is a living practical Syſtem or Body of new Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which exceeds even all thoſe that have hitherto been compounded by the Labor and Art of many Ages.</p>
            <p>If one that had ſpeculated deep into ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe matters, and made it his Study, not only to know, how to aſſign natural Reaſons for ſome ſtrange new Acts, that looked like Miracles by being peculiar to the individual Genius of ſome particular admired Man, but carrying his Enquiry to a much greater height had ſpeculated likewiſe, what might
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0180400100:27"/>
poſſibly be achieved by human Genius in the full Perfection of Nature, and had laid it down as a <hi>Theſis</hi> by ſtrong Arguments, that ſuch Things might be compaſſed by a human Genius (if in its true degree of Perfection) as are the hourly Operations of the Perſon's Life I am writing, he would have been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a wild Romantick Enthuſiaſt, inſtead of a Natural Philoſopher. Some of the wiſeſt would be Infidels to ſo new and ſo refined a Scheme of Thinking, and demand Experiment, or cry it was all againſt Reaſon, and would not allow the leaſt Tittle to be true without it. Yet the Man that had found out ſo great a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as to tell us, what Might be done by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Genius, as it is here actually done, would have been a great Man within himſelf; but wanting farther, Experimental Proof could lay no claim to the Belief of others, or conſequently to their Eſteem: But how great then is the Man, who makes it conſtantly his Practice, actually to Do, what would not otherwiſe have been thought to be of ſuch a Nature, as might ever be acquired by mortal Capacity, tho' in its full Complement of all poſſible Perfection? He is not only great within himſelf, he is great to the World; his Experiments force our Belief, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing Singularity of thoſe Experiments, provokes both our Wonder and Eſteem.</p>
            <p>If any learned Man ſhould have advanced this Propoſition, that meer human Art could
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0180400100:28"/>
give to the Deaf-Man, what ſhould be equal to his Hearing, and to the Dumb-Man an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent for his want of Speech, ſo that he ſhould converſe as freely almoſt, as other Hearing or Talking Perſons, that he might tho' born Deaf, be by Art taught, how to Read, Write, and underſtand any Language, as well as Students that have their Hearing, would not the World, and many even of the Learned Part of it ſay, that nothing could be more extravagantly Wild, more Mad and Frantick? The learned Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Profeſſor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> did firſt of all lay down this Propoſition, and was counted by many to have overſhot the Point of Learning, and to have been the Author of a whimſical Theſis. And I ſhould not have wondered, if, after a Man's having aſſerted This might be done before it was actually done, ſome blind devout People, in thoſe Days, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him of Hereſy, and of attributing to Men a Power of working Miracles. The Notion of the <hi>Antipodes</hi> was by the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men of the Age in which St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> lived, and by the Great St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf treated in no milder a manner; yet if the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of teaching the Deaf and the Dumb a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, proved a Truth in Experience after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ought not thoſe to turn their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt into Admiration, ought not thoſe very People to Vote him into the Royal Society for laying down this Propoſition, who, before it proved true in Fact, would have been very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0180400100:29"/>
forward to have ſent him to <hi>Bedlam?</hi> The firſt Inſtance of this Accompliſhment in a Dumb Perſon, was proved before King <hi>Charles</hi> II. by this ſame Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> who was a Fellow of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and one of the moſt ingenious of that Society.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this, ſhould I come afterwards and ſay, that there is now living a Deaf and Dumb Man, and born ſo, who could by dint of his own Genius teach all others Deaf and Dumb to Read, Write, and Converſe with the Talking and Hearing Part of Mankind, ſome would, I warrant, very religiouſly conclude, that I was about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ſome ſtrange new Miracle-Monger and Impoſtor into the World; with a Deſign of ſetting up ſome new Sect of Antichriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, as formidable as that of the <hi>Brachmans.</hi> Should I proceed ſtill farther and ſay, that this ſame Perſon ſo Deaf and Dumb, might be able alſo to ſhew a preſaging Power, or kind of prophetical Genius (if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Expreſſion) by telling, any ſtrange Perſons, he never ſaw before in his Life, their Names at firſt Sight in Writing, and by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the paſt Actions of their Lives, and predicting to them determined Truths of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Contingencies; notwithſtanding what Divines ſay, that <hi>In futuris contingentibus non datur determinata veritas,</hi> would not they conclude that I was going to uſher in a new <hi>Mahomet?</hi> Since therefore there does exiſt ſuch a Man in <hi>London,</hi> who actually is Deaf
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0180400100:30"/>
and Dumb, and was born ſo, who does Write and Read, and Converſe as well as any Body, who teaches others Deaf and Dumb to Write and Read, and Converſe with any Body, who likewiſe can, by a preſaging Gift, ſet down in Writing the Name of any Stranger at firſt Sight, tell him his paſt Actions, and predict his future Occurrences in Fortune, and ſince he has practiſed this Talent as a Profeſſion with great Succeſs, for a long Series of Years, upon innumerable Perſons in every State and Vocation of Life, from the Peereſs to the Waiting-Woman, and from the Lady Mayoreſs to the Milliner and Sempſtreſs, will it not be wonderfully Entertaining to give the World a perfect Hiſtory of this ſo ſingular a Man's Life? And while we are relating the pleaſant Adventures with ſuch prodigious Variety, can any thing be more agreeably inſtructive in a New Way, than to interſperſe the Reaſons, and account for the manner how Nature, having a mind to be remarkable, performs by him Acts ſo myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>I have premiſed this Introduction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Merry and the Serious, with the Hopes of engaging many curious People of all ſorts to be my Readers, even from the airy nice Peruſer of Novels and Romances, neatly Bound, and finely Gilt, to the grave Philoſopher, that is daily thumbing over the muſty and tatter'd Pieces of more ſolid Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0180400100:31"/>
I have all the Wonders to tell, that ſuch a merry kind of a Prophet has told, to Entertain the Fancies of the firſt gay Tribe, by which means I may intice them into ſome ſolid Knowledge and Judgment of Human Nature; and I have ſeveral ſolid Diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Learning to make, Accounting for the manner of theſe Myſterious Operations, never touched upon before, in due Form and Order by the Hands of the Antient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Sages, that I may Bribe the Judgment of this laſt Grave Claſs ſo far, as to endure the Intermixing of Entertainment with their ſeverer Studies.</p>

Breath grows at laſt dubious: And thus it fares with the Perſon, who is the Subject of the following Sheets; as therefore it is my Propoſal to have a ſtrict regard to <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> ſo am I obliged to tell the Reader that I can with no certainty give an Account of him, till after he was Three Years Old; from which Age I knew him even to this Day: I will Anſwer for the Truths which I impart to the Publick during that Time, and as for his Birth and the Circumſtances of it, and how the firſt Three Years of his Life paſſed; I can only deliver them the ſame Account I have received from others, and leave them to their own Judgments, whether it ought to be deemed Real or Fabulous.</p>
            <p>The Father of our Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> (as theſe relate the Story) was from his Infancy of a very curious inquiſitive Nature, and of an Enterprizing Genius, and if he heard of any thing Suprizing to be ſeen, the Difficulty in Practiſe was enough to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to him the attempting to get a ſight of it at any rate or any Hazard. It is certain, that during ſome Civil broils and troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Grandfather of our Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> was driven with his Wife and Family by the Fate of War into the Iſle of <hi>Schetland,</hi> where he lived many Years, and during his Reſidence there, Mr. <hi>Archibald Campbell,</hi> the Father of our <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> was Born.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0180400100:33"/>
               <hi>Schetland</hi> lies North-Eaſt from <hi>Orkney,</hi> between 60 and 61 Degrees of Latitude. The largeſt Iſle of <hi>Schetland</hi> by the Natives called the <hi>Main-Land,</hi> is ſixty Miles in Length, from South-Weſt to the North-Eaſt, and from ſixteen, to one Mile, in Breadth.</p>
            <p>The People who Live in the ſmaller Iſles have abundance of Eggs and Fowl, which Contributes to maintain their Families du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Summer.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Folks are moſtly very nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and active in climbing the Rocks in queſt of thoſe Eggs and Fowl. This Exerciſe is far more diverting than Hunting and Hawking among us, and would certainly for the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, be followed by People of greater Diſtinction, was it not attended with very great Dangers, ſufficient to turn ſport into ſorrow, and which have often proved fatal to thoſe who too eagerly purſue their Game. Mr. <hi>Archibald Campbell</hi> however delighted extreamly in this way of Fowling, and uſed to condeſcend to mix with the common People for Company, becauſe none of the Youths of his Rank and Condition were ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſome enough to go along with him.</p>
            <p>The moſt remarkable Experiment of this ſort, is at the Iſle called the <hi>Noſs</hi> of <hi>Braſſah:</hi> The <hi>Noſs</hi> ſtanding at ſixteen fathom diſtance from the ſide of the Oppoſite Main; the higher and lower Rocks have two Stakes faſtened in each of them, and to theſe there
<pb facs="tcp:0180400100:34"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0180400100:35"/>
are Ropes tied: Upon the Ropes there is an Engine hung which they call a Cradle, and in this a Man makes his way over from the greater to the ſmaller Rocks, where he makes a Conſiderable purchaſe of Eggs and Fowl; but his return being by an Aſcent, makes it the more Dangerous, tho' thoſe on the great Rock have a Rope tied to the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, by which they draw it and the Man ſafe over for the moſt part? Over this Rock Mr. <hi>Archibald Campbell</hi> and five others were in that manner let down by Cradles and Ropes; but before they could be all drawn back again it grew Dark, and their Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates not daring to be benighted, were forced to withdraw, and Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Perſon left behind, having wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered too far, and not minded how the Day declined being intent on his Game. He paſſed that Night, you may eaſily gueſs, without much Sleep, and with great Anxiety of Heart. The night too as he lay in the open Air was, to add to his Misfortune, as Boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Tempeſtuous as his own mind; but in the end the Tempeſt proved very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for him: The Reader is to underſtand that the <hi>Hamburghers, Bremeners</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> carry on a great Fiſh Trade there. Accordingly a <hi>Holland</hi> Veſſel that was juſt coming in the ſound of <hi>Braſſah,</hi> was by this Tempeſt driven into a Creek of the Rock, which Nature had made into a Harbonr,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0180400100:36"/>
and they were Providentially ſaved from the bottom of the Sea by a Rock, from which humanly ſpeaking they could expect nothing but Deſtruction, and being ſent to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of that Sea. As never could a Man be taken hold of with ſo ſudden and ſurprizing a Diſaſter, ſo no body could meet with a more ſudden and ſurprizing Relief than Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> found, when he ſaw a Ship ſo near. He made to the Veſſel, and begged the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to take him in; they asked him what he would give them, or ſaid the Barbarous Sailors, we will even leave you where you are; he told them his diſaſter, but they asked Money and nothing elſe would move them: As he knew them a ſelf inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted People, he bethought himſelf, that if he ſhould tell them of the plenty of Fowls and Eggs they would get there; he might not only be taken in a Paſſenger, but made a Partner in the Money ariſing from the Stock; It ſucceeded accordingly, when he propoſed it, the whole Crew were all at Work, and in four hours, pretty well ſtored the Veſſel, and then returning on board ſet Sail for <hi>Holland.</hi> They offered Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> to put him in at his own Iſland: But having a mind to ſee <hi>Holland,</hi> and being a Partner, to learn their way of Merchandize: which he thought he might turn to hi, Country Mens Advantage, he told them he would go the Voyage out with them, and ſee

the Country of thoſe who were his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers, a neceſſary way of Speech, when one has a Deſign to ſooth <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who but for Intereſt would have left him unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and for ought they knew a perpetual ſole Inhabitant of a Dreadful Rock, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed round with Precipices, ſome, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fathom high. Not ſo, the Iſlanders (who are wrongly called a Savage ſet of Mortals) no, they came in queſt of him after ſo bitter a Night, not doubting to find him, but fearing to find him in a Lamentable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: they hunted and ranſacked every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hole and corner in the Rock, but all in vain. In one place they ſaw a great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fowls enough to ſerve forty Families for a Week; and then they Gueſſed, tho' they had not the ill Fortune to meet the Eagles frequently noted to hover about thoſe Iſles, that they might have Devoured part of him on ſome Precipice of the Rock, and dropt the Remnant into the Sea. Night came upon them, and they were afraid of falling into the ſame Diſaſter, they went to relieve Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> from. They returned each to their proper Basket, and were drawn up ſafe by their reſpective Friends, who were amazed that one Basket was drawn up empty which was let down for Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> and that there was not the leaſt Intelligence to be had Concerning him, but the Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Story of his having been Devour'd by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0180400100:38"/>
Eagles. The Story was told at Home; and with the Lamentation of the whole Family, and all his Friends; he was looked upon to be Murthered or Dead.</p>
            <p>Return we now to Mr. <hi>Archibald Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> ſtill alive, and on Board the <hi>Holland</hi> Veſſel; ſecure as he thought within himſelf, that from the Delivery he lately had by the Gift of Providence, he was not intended to be liable to any more Misfortunes and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Life, in the Compaſs of ſo ſmall a Voyage. But his Lot was placed otherwiſe in the Book of Fate, than he too fondly imagined: His Time of Happineſs was dated ſome Pages lower down, and more rubs and difficulties were to be Encountered with, before his Stars intended to lead him to the Port of Felicity. Juſt as he Arrived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> a Terrible Storm aroſe, and in Danger of their Lives, for many Hours, they Weathered out the Tempeſt; and a Calm promiſing fair afreſh, they made to the Coaſt of <hi>Zealand;</hi> but a new Hurricane prevented the Ship from coming there alſo; and after having loſt their Maſts and Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, they were driven into <hi>Lapland.</hi> There they went a Shore in order to carren and repair their Ship, and take in Proviſions, while the Ship was Repairing by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> our Iſlander made merry with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, being the moſt inclined to their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Cuſtoms; he there became acquainted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0180400100:39"/>
with a very Beautiful Woman, who fell in Love with him, and after a very ſhort ſpace of Time he Married her. About the Time when the Ship departed, his Wife who was very Rich, was big with Child of a Son, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell.</hi> He wrote a Letter by the Maſter of the Veſſel to his Parents, in <hi>Schetland,</hi> concerning the various Adventures he had met with, which was delivered the <hi>June</hi> following, about the time of Fiſhing, to his Parents, and ſeveral Perſons had Copies thereof, and for ought I know, ſome retain them to this very Day; ſure I am, that many remember the Particulars of this Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Affair, who are now living in that Iſland.</p>
            <p>The Letter being very Remarkable and Singular in all its Circumſtances: I ſhall preſent it the Reader Word for Word, as it was given into my Hands, together with ſome others which he wrote afterwards, in all which I am aſſured by very credible Perſons, and undoubted Authorities; there are not the leaſt Alterations, but what the Verſion of it from the then <hi>Scotch</hi> Manner of Expreſſion into a more Modern <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dreſs, made abſolutely neceſſary.</p>

                  <p>THE ſame odd Variety of Accident which put it out of my Power to be Perſonally preſent with you for ſo long a time, put it likewiſe out of my Power to write to you. At laſt Fortune has ſo ordered it, that I can ſend a Letter to you, before I can come my ſelf, and it is written Expreſly to tell you the Adventures I have met with, which haved etained me this tedious Space of Time, from my Dear Father, and becauſe the ſame Captain of a Ship that brings you this, might as eaſily have brought your Son to ſpeak for himſelf. I ſhall in the next place lay before you the neceſſity there is for my ſtay a little longer among the ſtrange Natives of the Country, where I now Inhabit, and where I am in a manner become Naturalized.</p>
                  <p>You have, no doubt of it been, informed by my Companions, ſome of whom I hope got ſafe back again, if not all, that I was loſt, where many a brave Man has periſhed before me, by going over the high Precipices of the Mountain <hi>Braſſah</hi> in a Basket, ſliding down by a Rope. I muſt ſuppoſe I have given you the Anguiſh of a Father, for a Son, who you thought, had loſt his Life by ſuch a Fool har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Attempt, and I implore your Pardon with all the Power of Filial Contrition, Penitence and Duty. You have always ſhewed me ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0180400100:41"/>
ſingular Marks of Paternal Affection, that I know your Receipt of this Letter will fill your Heart with Joy, and Cauſe you to Sign me an Abſolution and free Pardon for all the Errors I have Committed, and think the Sufferings, I have undergone for my Raſhneſs and Indiſcretion, a ſufficient Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for my Crime of making you by my Undutifulneſs a Partner of my Sorrows. To free you the more from this uneaſineſs, I know I need only tell you, that every Grief of mine is gone excepting one, which is, that I muſt ſtill loſe the Pleaſure of ſeeing you a little longer. There was never ſurely a more bitter Night, than that which muſt by me be for ever remembered; when I was loſt in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Braſſah,</hi> where I muſt for aught I know have liv'd for ever a wild ſingle Inhabitant, but that the Storm which made the Night ſo uneaſie to me, rendered the firſt Approach of Day-light, beyond Meaſure, Delightful. The firſt Providential Glimpſe of the Morning gave me a view of a Ship driven by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt into a Creek of the Rock, that was by Nature formed like a Harbour; a Miraculous Security of Deliverance as I thought, both for the Ships Crew and my ſelf: I made all the haſte I could, you may be ſure to them, and I found them to be <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> that were come for Fiſh, but in lieu of Fiſh I inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them to Load it with Eggs and Fowl, which we compaſſed very happily in a ſhort
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0180400100:42"/>
Space of Time, and I was to be a Sharer with the Captain in the Lading, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained to go for <hi>Holland,</hi> to ſee the Sale, and the Nature of Traffick, but when we were at Sea, after much bad weather we made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Zealand,</hi> but we were driven upon the Coaſt of <hi>Finland,</hi> by a new Storm, and thence into <hi>Lapland,</hi> where I now am, and from whence I ſend you this Letter.</p>
                  <p>I could not come into a place ſo properly named for my Reception: As I had been Undutiful to you, and Fortune ſeemed to make me an Exile, or a Baniſhed Man, by way of Puniſhment for the Vices of my Youth; ſo <hi>Lapland</hi> (which is a Word origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally derived from the <hi>Finland</hi> Word <hi>Lappi,</hi> that is Exiles, and from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Word <hi>Lap,</hi> ſignifying Baniſhed, from which two Kingdoms moſt of our Inhabitants were Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed hither, for not embracing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion) was certainly the propereſt Country in the World to receive Me.</p>
                  <p>When firſt I entered this Country, I thought I was got into quite another World: The Men are all of them Pigmies to our Tall Brawny <hi>Highlanders;</hi> they are generally ſpeaking, not above Three Cubits high, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that tho' the whole Country of <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is immenſly large, and I have heard it reckoned by the Inhabitants, to be above a Hundted <hi>German</hi> Leagues in Length, and Fourſcore and Ten in Breadth: Yet I was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0180400100:43"/>
the Talleſt Man there, and looked upon as a Giant. The Diſtrict in which I live now, is called <hi>Uma Lapmark</hi>—You muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Sir, that when I Landed at North Cape, in <hi>Kimi-Lapmark,</hi> another Diſtrict of <hi>Lapland;</hi> there was at that time a moſt Beautiful Lady come to ſee a Sick Relation of her Father's; who was Prefect, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Uma Lapmark,</hi> which is a Poſt of Great Diſtinction—This Lady, by being frequently in the Company of <hi>French</hi> Merchants, who Traffick now and then in that Province of <hi>Uma Lapmark,</hi> underſtood French, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard of a Man ſix Foot and a half high, deſired to ſee me, and when I came, ſhe happened mightily to like my Perſon; and ſhe talked <hi>French,</hi> which when I anſwered, ſhe made great Signs of Joy, that ſhe could Communicate her Sentiments to me, and ſhe told me who ſhe was, how Rich, and that not one in the Company beſides, could underſtand a Syllable we ſaid, and ſo I might ſpeak my Mind freely to her; ſhe told me the Cuſtoms of the Country, that it was divided into Cantons, like our Shires, and thoſe Cantons into Rekars, or certain Grounds allotted to Families, that are juſt like our Clans. As ſhe was beyond meaſure Beautiful, ſhe was extreamly good humoured (a thing rarely to be met among <hi>Lapland</hi> Women) of a better Stature than her Country Women, and very Rich, and of good Birth; I thought
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0180400100:44"/>
it would be a prodigious Turn of Fortune, for a Man in my Circumſtances, if I could make any Progreſs in her Heart, which ſhe ſeemed a little to open to me, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for the beginning, as if ſuch a ſucceſsful Event, if managed with Prudence, might not be deſpaired off. Souls that are Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous are apt to Love, and Compaſſion is the beſt introducer of Love into a Generous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and that was the beſt Stock I had, to go upon in my Courtſhip: I told her of all my Calamities, my Dangers, and my Eſcapes; the Goodneſs of my Birth, as being Allied to one of the Greateſt Nobles in our Iſland; and ſtill ſhe would ask me to tell it her over again, tho' every time I told it, juſt at ſuch and ſuch Paſſages, ſhe was forced to drop the Tears from her Eyes. In fine I grew more in Love with her, out of a Senſe of Gratitude now, than by the Power of her Charms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: The matter in a few Days, went ſo far, that ſhe owned to me, I had her Heart. As to Marriage, I did not then know the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Nation; I thought that if it proved only Dangerous to me, I loved her ſo well, that I intended to Marry her, tho' the Law was to Pronounce me Dead for it; but I did not know whether it might not be Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for her too, to Engage in ſuch a State with me, and I reſolved in that Caſe, rather to be ſingly unhappy, than to involve her in Diſtreſs, and make her the fair Companion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0180400100:45"/>
of my Woes. I would not tell her ſo, for fear ſhe ſhould out of Love hide from me thoſe Dangers, and therefore uſing a kind ſort of Diſſimulation, I conjured her to tell me the Laws and Cuſtoms of Marriages in that Country, to a tittle, and that nothing ſhould hinder us from Happineſs. She told me exactly, as I find ſince. Our Marriage ſaid ſhe, will be very hard to Compaſs; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded we follow the ſtrict Rule of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. For our Women here, are bound not to ſee the Man, who makes their Addreſſes to them, in ſome time. His way of Courtſhip, is to come to the Parents, and his neareſt Friends and Relations muſt make her Father Preſents, and Supplicate him like a King, to Grant him his Daughter. The Courtſhip often laſts two or three Years, and ſometimes has not its Effect at laſt: But if it has, the Woman is dragged by her Father and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Church, as unwilling to go to be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, which is looked upon as a greater part of Modeſty in her, according to the greater Diſinclination ſhe ſhews. My Father and Brother, ſaid ſhe, will both be againſt it: You have no Relations in this Country to move your Suit, I cannot be ſo Hypocritical, as to be dragged unwillingly to him I own I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for my Lawful Husband, and therefore as I have an Inclination to you, and I dare own I have, I will not follow thoſe methods, which I diſapprove. I have talked with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0180400100:46"/>
                     <hi>Swedes,</hi> and ſeveral Polite <hi>Frenchmen</hi> about their Manner of Eſpouſals, and I am told, that when Souls are naturally united by Affection, the Couple ſo mutually and reciprocally Loving, tho' they had rather have their Parents leave if likely to be got, yet unwilling to be diſappointed, only go to the next Miniſter's and Marry for better for worſe. This way I approve of, for where two Perſons naturally love each other, the reſt is nothing but a modeſt reſtraint to their Wiſhes, and ſince 'tis only Cuſtom, my own Reaſon teaches me, there is no Error Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nor any harm done in breaking thro' it, upon ſo commendable an Occaſion. I have, added ſhe, a Thouſand Rain-Deer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to me, beyond my Father's Power of taking away, and a Third ſhare in a Rekar or Clan, that is ten Leagues in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, in the Byar or Canton of <hi>Uma Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi> This is at my own Diſpoſal, and it is all your own, if you pleaſe to accept of it with me. Our Women are very coy, when they are Courted, tho' they have never ſo much an Inclination to their Suitor: but good Reaſon and the Commerce I have had with Perſons of Politer Nations, than ours is, teach me that this proceeds entirely from Vanity and Affectation, and the greateſt Proof of a Women's Modeſty, Chaſtity, and Sincerity certainly conſiſts (contrary to the general corrupted opinion) in yielding up
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0180400100:47"/>
her ſelf ſoon into the Arms of the Man ſhe Loves. For ſhe that can dally with a Heart ſhe prizes, can give away her Heart (when ſhe is once baulked) to any Man, even tho' ſhe diſlikes him. You muſt Judge (my Dear Father) I muſt be touched with a Woman that was exceeding Beautiful, beyond any of her Nation, and who had Thoughts as Beautiful as her Perſon. I therefore was all in Rapture, and longed for the Matrimony, but ſtill loved her enough to propoſe the Queſtion, I reſolved to her, <hi>viz.</hi> If it would not be in her Nation accounted a Clandeſtine Marriage, and prove of great Damage to her.</p>
                  <p>To this ſhe anſwered, with all the Wiſdom which could be expected from a Woman, who had given ſuch Eminent Tokens of her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on other points, amidſt a Nation ſo Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous in its Manners, and ſo Corrupt in its Principles, as <hi>Lapland</hi> is. I am, ſaid ſhe, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my Father, for nothing by our Laws, having no Portion of him, but only what was preſented me by my Relations, at my Birth, according to Cuſtom, in Lands and Rain-Deer. My Father is but Deputy Governor, 'tis a <hi>Swede</hi> who is the Governor of <hi>Uma,</hi> and if I pay to him at every Mart and Fair the due Tribute which muſt either conſiſt of Fifty Rain-Deer, or one hundred and fifty Rixdollars, he will have the Prieſt that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's us preſent at the Court of Juſtice, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0180400100:48"/>
to our Cuſtom, and keep us in Poſſeſſion of our Rights, that we may be enabled to pay Tribute to the Crown of <hi>Sweden.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, before the Abolition of the <hi>Birkarti,</hi> which were our Native Judges, we could not have Married thus without Danger to us both; but now there is none at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Dear Father,</hi> You muſt eaſily imagin that I could not help embracing with all tenderneſs ſo dear and ſo lovely a Woman. In fine, I am Married to her, I have lived very happily hitherto, and am now grown more happy, for ſhe is big with Child; and like, before my Letter comes to your Hands, to make you a Grandfather of a pretty Boy. You will perhaps wonder, that I name the Sex of the Child, before it comes into the World; But we have a way in <hi>Lapland</hi> of finding that out, which tho' ſome Judicious People call Superſtitious, I am really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of by Experience, and therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged my dear Wife's curioſity, when ſhe ſignified to me, ſhe had a Mind to make the uſual Tryal, whether the Child ſhe was going to be Delivered of, would be a Boy or a Girl.</p>
                  <p>You muſt underſtand (<hi>My Dear Father</hi>) the People here Judge of the Sex of the Child by the Moon, unto which they compare a Big-bellied Woman. If they ſee a Star appear juſt above the Moon, it is a ſign it will be a Boy, but, if the Star be juſt below the Moon, they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecture her to be big with a Girl,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0180400100:49"/>
This Obſervation and Remark of <hi>Laplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> has (I know) been accounted by ſome, and thoſe Wiſe and Judicious Men too, to be ridiculouſly Superſtitious; but I have been led into an eaſie belief of this Myſtery, by a Miſtreſs (that is Superior to Wiſdom it ſelf) Conſtant, and therefore probably Infallible, Experience. I therefore indulged my Wife in this her requeſt, and went with her to the Ceremony; the Star appeared above the Moon, which Prognoſticates a Boy, which I wiſh may, and I ſcarce doubt will prove true, and when ſhe is brought to Bed, I will ſend you word of it. It is remarkable likewiſe, that a Star was ſeen juſt before the Moon, which we alſo count a very good Omen. For it is a cuſtom likewiſe here in <hi>Lapland,</hi> to conſult the Moon, as an Oracle about the Health and Vigour of the Child. If a Star be ſeen juſt before the Moon, we count it a ſign of a luſty and well grown Child, without Blemiſh; if a Star comes juſt after, we reckon it a token that the Child will have ſome defect or deformity, or die ſoon after it is Born.</p>
                  <p>Having thus told you the Manners of the Country I live in at preſent, as much at large as the ſpace of a Letter will permit, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you my own happy Circumſtances, and the kindly Promiſes of the Heavens, that are Uſhering in the Birth of my Child, I would not have you think that I addict my

ſelf to the Superſtitions of the Country, which are very many and groundleſs; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing partly from the remainder of <hi>Pagan</hi> Worſhip, which is ſtill Cultivated among ſome of the more obſtinate Inhabitants. I have on the Contrary, ſince I Married her, endeavoured to repay my Wife's Temporal Bleſſings to me with thoſe that are endleſs, inſtructed her in all the Points of Religion, and made her perfectly a Chriſtian; and ſhe by her Devotion and Prayers for me, makes me ſuch amends for it, that I hope in us two St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying will be verified, <hi>viz. That the Woman ſhall be ſanctified in her Husband, and the Husband ſhall be ſanctified in his Wife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, I muſt take notice in this Place, with all due deference to Chriſtianity, that tho' I am obliged to applaud the Prudence and Piety of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who Conſtituting <hi>Swediſh</hi> Governors over this Country, Abrogated their Practiſe of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and Art Magick upon pain of Death; Yet that King carried the point too far, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with theſe Arts, the pretenſions to the gift of a ſecond ſight, which you know how frequent it is with us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which I aſſure you, my Wife (tho' ſhe durſt not Publickly own it, for fear of incurring the penalty of thoſe <hi>Swediſh</hi> Laws) does as it were inherit (for all her Anceſtors, before her, have had it from time Immemorial) to

a greater degree than ever I knew any of our Country Women or Country Men.</p>
                  <p>One day this laſt Week ſhe diſtracted me, between the extreams of Joy and Sorrow. She told me I ſhould ſee you ſhortly, and that my coming Son would grow to be one of the moſt remarkable Men in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for his Power of Foreſight; But that I ſhould ſpeedily loſe her, and meet with difficulties in my own Country, in the ſame manner as my Father (meaning you Sir) had done before me, and on the ſame Account, <hi>viz.</hi> Of Civil broils, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Wars in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <p>I Am now the happieſt Man alive; the Proſperous part of my Wife's Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I mentioned to you in my laſt, is come in ſome meaſure to paſs. The Child ſhe has brought me proves a Boy, and as fine a one, as I ever beheld, (if fondneſs for my own makes me not blind) And ſure it can't be fondneſs, becauſe other plain Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances joined at his birth, to prove it a more than ordinary Remarkable one. He was born with a Cawl upon his Head, which we count one of the Luckieſt Signs, that can be in Nature; he had likewiſe three Teeth ready Cut thro' the Gums, and we reckon that an undeniable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Promiſe given to the World by Nature, that ſhe intends ſuch a Perſon for her extraordinary Favourite, and that he is born for great Things, which I dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beg of Heaven, may come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Since I have known for ſome Months, what it is to be a Father, it adds a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable weight to thoſe Affections which I had for my Wife. I thought that my Tenderneſs for her was at the height of perfection before; which ſhews how little we know of thoſe Parts of Nature, that we have yet never tryed, and of which we have not yet been allotted our ſhare to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0180400100:53"/>
act upon the Stage of Life. I find that I did love her then as well as a Husband could love a Wife (that is) a Wife without a Child, but the love to a Wife that has a Child, is a feeling wonderful and inexpreſſibly different. A Child is the Seal and the Pledge of Love, Meditating upon this, has likewiſe doubled my Affection to you; I loved you before as a Son, and becauſe as ſuch, I felt your Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but my Love is much increaſed now, becauſe I know the tenderneſs which you felt for me as a Father: With theſe pleaſing images of thought, I often keep you nearer company at this vaſt diſtance, than when I lived irregularly under your Eye. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions render a Solitary Life dear to me. And tho' I have no manner of Acquaintance with her Relations, who hate me as I am told, nor indeed with almoſt any of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, but my own Domeſticks, and thoſe I am forced to deal with, yet I have as much methinks, as I wiſh for, unleſs I could come over to <hi>Schetland,</hi> and live with you, which I the more ardently deſire; becauſe I think I and my Wife could be true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to you, in your advanced Years; now I know what living truly is. I am daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading my Wife to go with me; but ſhe denies me with kind Expreſſions, and ſays, ſhe owes too much to the Place (however leſs pleaſant in it ſelf than other Climates) where ſhe had the happineſs of firſt joining

Hands with me in Wedlock, ever to part from it. But I muſt explain how I ask, and how ſhe refuſes. I reſolved never directly and downrightly to ask her, becauſe I know ſhe can refuſe me nothing: And that would be bearing hard upon the Goodneſs of her Will. But my way of perſwading her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in endeavouring to make her in Love with the Place by agreeable Deſcriptions of it, and likewiſe of the Humane temper of the People; ſo that I ſhortly ſhall induce her to ſignifie to me, that it is her own Will to to come with me, and then I ſhall ſeem rather to conſent to her Will, than to have moved it over to my own. Theſe hopes I have of ſeeing my dear Father very ſhortly, and I know ſuch News would make this Letter which I therefore ſend more acceptable to him, to whom I will be,</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. After the Death of Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell's</hi> Mother in <hi>Lapland.</hi> His Father <hi>Archibald</hi> returned with his Son to <hi>Scotland.</hi> His Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriage, and how his Son was taught to Write and Read.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Archibald Campbell,</hi> having bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his <hi>Lapland</hi> Lady, returned to <hi>Scotland;</hi> and brought over with him his Son Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell:</hi> By that time he had been a Year in his own Country, he Married a Second Wife; a Lady whom I had known very well, for ſome Years, and then I firſt ſaw the Boy, but as they went into the Weſtern Iſlands, I ſaw them not again in three Years. She being quite contrary to the cruel way much in Uſe among Step-Mothers, very fond of the Boy, was accuſtomed to ſay, ſhe did, and would always think him her own Son. The Child came to be about four Years of Age (as ſhe has related to me the Story ſince) and not able to ſpeak one Word, nor to hear any noiſe; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him uſed to be mightily oppreſſed with Grief, and complain heavily to his new Wife, who was no leſs perplexed that a Boy ſo pretty, the Son of ſo particular a Woman, which he had made his Wife, by ſtrange Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Adventures, and a Child coming
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0180400100:57"/>
into the World with ſo many amazing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending his Birth, ſhould loſe thoſe precious Senſes, by which alone the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Commerce of Mankind is upheld and maintained, and that he ſhould be deprived of all Advantages of Education, which could raiſe him to the Character of being the great Man, that ſo many concurring incidents at his Nativity promiſed and betokened, he would be.</p>
            <p>One day a Learned Divine, who was of the Univerſity of <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> but had viſited <hi>Oxford,</hi> and been acquainted with the chief Men of Science there, happening to be in converſation with the Mother in Law of this Child, ſhe related to him her Son's Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, with ſo many Marks of Sorrow, that, ſhe moved the good old Gentleman's Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and excited in him a deſire, to give her what Relief and Conſolation he could, in this unhappy caſe. His particular inclination to do her good Offices, made him reccollect, that at the time he was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he had been in Company with one Doctor <hi>Wallis,</hi> a Man famous for Learning, who had told him, that he had taught a (born Deaf and Dumb) Man to Write, and to Read, and even to utter ſome ſounds articulately with his Mouth; and, that he told him, he was then going to Commit to Print the Method he made uſe of, in ſo Inſtructing that Perſon, that others, in the like unfortunate Condition,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0180400100:58"/>
might receive the ſame Benefits and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from other Maſters, which his Deaf and Dumb Pupil had received from him. A Dumb Man recovering his Speech, or a Blind Man gaining his Sight, or a Deaf one getting his Hearing, could not be more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoyed, than Mrs. <hi>Campbell</hi> was at theſe unexpected Tidings, and ſhe wept for Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when he told it. The Good Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Animated and Encouraged her with the kindeſt Promiſes, and to keep alive her hopes, aſſured her he would ſend to one of the chief Bookſellers in <hi>London,</hi> to enquire after the Book, who would certainly procure it him, if it was to be got, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he would peruſe it diligently, make himſelf Maſter of Doctor <hi>Wallis</hi> his Method, and tho' he had many great Works upon his Hands at that time, he would ſteal from his other Studies leiſure enough to compleat ſo Charitable an Office, as teaching the Dumb and Deaf to Read, and to Write, and give her Son, who was by <hi>Nature</hi> Deprived of them, the Advantages of Speech, as far as <hi>Art</hi> would permit that <hi>Natural</hi> Defect to be ſupplied by her Powerful Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>When the Mother came Home, the Child, who could hear no knocking, and therefore it muſt be by a ſtrange and inexplicable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in Nature, was the firſt, that ran to the Door, and falling in a great fit of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0180400100:59"/>
(a thing it was not much uſed to before, having on the contrary rather a Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt of Complexion) it clung round its Mother's Knees, inceſſantly embracing and kiſſing them, as if juſt at that time it had an inſight, into what the Mother had been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, and into its own Approaching Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from its Miſery.</p>
            <p>When the Mother came with the Child in her hand to the Father, to tell him the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come News; the Child burſt afreſh into a great fit of Laughter, which continued for an unuſual ſpace of time; and the ſcene of ſuch reciprocal Affection and Joy between a Wife and her own Husband, on ſo ſignal an occaſion, is a thing, eaſier to be felt by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of a good Diſpoſition, imagining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the ſame Circumſtance, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to a Child they loved with fondneſs, than to be expreſſed or deſcribed by the Pen of any Writer. But it is certain, whenever they ſpoke of this Affair, as any Body, who knows the impatience of Parents for the Welfare of an only Child, may gueſs they muſt be often Diſcourſing it over, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time was come; the Boy, who uſed ſeldom ſo much as to ſmile at other times, and who could never hear the greateſt noiſe that could be made, would conſtantly look wiſhfully in their Faces, and laugh immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, which is a plain Indication, that there was then a wonderful Inſtinct in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0180400100:60"/>
as I ſaid before, which made him fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte his good Fortune, and, if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Expreſſion, The Dawnings as it were of the Second ſight, were then Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant within him.</p>
            <p>To confirm this, the happy hour of his Deliverance being come; and the Doctor having procured Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi>'s Book, came with great Joy, and deſired to ſee his Pupil; ſcarce were the Words out of his Mouth, when the Child happened to come into the Room, and running towards the Doctor, fell on his Knees, kiſſed his Hand eagerly, and Laughed as before, which to me, is a Demonſtration, that he had an inſight into the Good, which the Doctor intended him.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that ſeveral Learned Men, who have written concerning the <hi>Second ſight,</hi> have Demonſtrated by unconteſtable Proofs, and undeniable Arguments, that Children, nay, even Horſes and Cows, ſee the <hi>Second ſight,</hi> as well as Men and Women advanced in Years. But of this, I ſhall Diſcourſe at large, in its proper Place, having allotted a whole future Chapter for that ſame Subject of Second ſightedneſs.</p>
            <p>In about half a Year, the Doctor taught his little Dumb Pupil, Firſt, to know his Letters, then to name any thing whatſoever, to leave off ſome Savage Motions, which he had taken of his own accord, before to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his Mind by, and to impart his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0180400100:61"/>
Thoughts by his Fingers and his Pen, in a Manner as intelligible, and almoſt as ſwift thro' the Eyes, as that is of conveying our Ideas to one another, by our Voices thro' the Condites and Portholes of the Ears. But in little more than two Years, he could Write and Read, as well as any Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a great many People cannot conceive this; and others pretend it is not to be done in Nature: I will a little Diſcourſe upon Doctor <hi>Wallis</hi>'s Foundation, and ſhew in a Manner obvious to the moſt ignorant; how this hitherto, Miſterious help, may be eaſily Adminiſtred to the Deaf, and the Dumb, which ſhall be the Subject of the enſuing Chapter.</p>
            <p>But I cannot Conclude this, without tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the handſome ſaying, with which this Child, when not quite Six Years old, as ſoon as he thought he could expreſs himſelf well, payed his firſt Acknowledgment to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and which Promiſed, how great his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Genius was to be, when ſo Witty a Child ripened into Man. The Words, he wrote to him, were theſe, only altered into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from the <hi>Scotch.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. III. The Method of Teaching <hi>Deaf</hi> and <hi>Dumb</hi> Perſons to Write, Read, and underſtand a Language.</head>
            <p>IT is, I muſt conſeſs, in ſome Meaſure amazing to me, that Men, of any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Share of Learning, ſhould not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceive of themſelves, a plain Reaſon for this Art, and know how to Account for the Practicability of it, the Moment they hear the Propoſition advanced, the Reaſons for it, are ſo obvious to the very firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration we can make about it. It will be likewiſe as amazing to me, that the moſt ignorant ſhould not conceive it, after ſo plain a Reaſon is given them for it, as I am now going to ſet down.</p>
            <p>To begin: How are Children at firſt taught a Language that can hear? Are they not taught by Sounds? And what are thoſe Sounds, but Token, and Signs to the Ear, importing and ſignifying ſuch and ſuch a Thing? If then, there can be Signs made to the Eye, agreed by the Party teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:0180400100:63"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0180400100:64"/>
the Child, that they ſignifie ſuch and ſuch a Thing, will not the Eye of the Child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them to the Mind, as well as the Ear? They are indeed different Marks to different Senſes, but both the one and the other do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſignifie the ſame Things or Notions, according to the Will of the Teacher, and conſequently, muſt have an equal Effect with the Perſon, who is to be inſtructed: For tho' the Manners ſignifying are different, the Things ſignified are the ſame.</p>
            <p>For Example; If, after having invented an Alphabet upon the Fingers, a Maſter always keeps Company with a Deaf Child, and teaches it to call for whatſoever it wants, by ſuch Motions of the Fingers, which if put down by Letters, according to each invented Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each Finger, would form in writing a Word of a Thing, which it wanted; might not he by theſe regular Motions teach it's Eye the ſame Notions of Things, as Sounds do to the Ears of Children that Hear: The Manner of Teaching the Alphabet by Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, is plainly ſet down in the following Table.</p>
            <p>When the Deaf Child has Learn't by theſe Motions a good Stock of Words, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that hear firſt learn by Sounds, we may methinks call not improperly, the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of ſuch a Dumb Infant, its <hi>Mouth,</hi> and the Eye of ſuch a Deaf Child, its <hi>Ear.</hi> When he has learnt thus far, he muſt be taught to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0180400100:65"/>
Write the Alphabet, according as it was A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the Motions of his Fingers: As for Inſtance, the five Vowels, <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> by pointing to the top of the five Fingers, and the other Letters, <hi>b, c, d, &amp;c.</hi> by ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place or Poſture of a Finger, as in the above-mentioned Table is ſet forth, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as ſhall be agreed upon. When this is done the Marks B, R, E, A, D, (and ſo of all other Words) Correſponding with ſuch Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, conveys thro' his Eyes, unto his Head the ſame Notion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Thing ſignified, as the Sound we give to thoſe ſame Letters, making the Word <hi>Bread,</hi> do into our Heads thro' the Ears.</p>
            <p>This once done, he may be eaſily taught to underſtand the Parts of Speech, as the <hi>Verb,</hi> the <hi>Noun, Pronoun,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo by Rules of <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Syntax,</hi> to compound Ideas, and connect his Words into a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The Method of which, ſince it is plainly ſet forth in Doctor <hi>Wallis</hi>'s Letter to Mr. <hi>Beverly.</hi> I ſhall ſet it down by way of Extract; that People in the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with the Perſon we treat of, and of the like Genius, may not have their Talents loſt, for want of the like Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>When once a Deaf Perſon has learn't ſo far, as to underſtand the common Diſcourſe of others, and to expreſs his Mind (tolerably well in Writing) I ſee no room to doubt, but that (provided Nature has endowed him with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0180400100:66"/>
a proper Strength of Genius, as other Men that hear) he may become capable (upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Improvement) of ſuch further Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as is attainable by Reading. For I muſt here join with the Learned Doctor <hi>Wallis,</hi> in aſſerting (as to the preſent caſe before us) that no Reaſon can be aſſigned, why ſuch a Deaf Perſon may not attain the underſtanding of a Language as <hi>perfectly</hi> as thoſe that hear; and with the ſame Learned Author, I take upon me to lay down this Propoſition, as certain, that allowing the Deaf Perſon the like Time and Exerciſe, as to other Men is requiſite in order to attain the Perfection of a Language, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of it, he may underſtand as well, and Write as good Language as other Men, and abating only what doth depend upon Sound, as Tones, Cadencies, and ſuch Punctilio's; no whit inferior to what he may attain to, if he had his hearing as others have?</p>

                        <p>And in like manner, from Time to Time, may be added more Collections, or Clauſes of Names or Words, conveniently digeſted, under diſtinct Heads, and ſuitable Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to be written in diſtinct Leaves or Pages of his Book, in ſuch Order, as may ſeem convenient.</p>
                        <p>When he is furniſhed with a Competent Number of Names, though not ſo many as I have mentioned: It will be ſeaſonable to teach him, under the Titles Singular and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0180400100:70"/>
Plural. The Formation of Plurals from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars; by adding S or Es. As Hand Hands, Face Faces, Fiſh Fiſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſome few irregulars, as Man Men, Woman Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Foot Feet, Tooth Teeth, Mouſe Mice, Lowſe Lice, Ox Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which, except the irregulars, will ſerve for Poſſeſſives, to be afrer taught him, which are formed by their Primitives by like Addition of S or Es, except ſome few irregulars, as My Mine, Thy Thine, Our Ours, Your Yours, His, Her, Hers, Their Theirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in all thoſe, and other like Caſes, it will be proper firſt, to ſhew him the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and then the General Title.</p>
                        <p>Then teach him in another Page or Paper, the Particulars, a, an, the, this, that, theſe, thoſe.</p>
                        <p>And the Pronouns, I, me, my, mine, thou, thee, thy, thine, we, us, ourours, ye, you, your, yours, he, him, his, ſhe, her, hers, it, it's, they, them, their, theirs, who, whom, who's.</p>
                        <p>Then under the Titles <hi>Subſtantive Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> teach him to Connect theſe, as my Hand, your Head, his Foot, his Feet, her Arm, Arms, our Hats, their Shoes, <hi>John</hi>'s Coat, <hi>William</hi>'s Band, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in Order to furniſh him with more Adjectives, under the Title <hi>Colours,</hi> you may place, black, white, gray, green, blue, yellow, red, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and having ſhewed the particulars, let him know that theſe are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0180400100:71"/>
called Colours. The like for taſte and ſmell, as ſweet, bitter, ſoure, ſtink.</p>
                        <p>And for Hearing: ſound, noiſe, word.</p>
                        <p>Then for touch or feeling: hot, warm, cold, cool, wet, moiſt, dry, hard, ſoft, tough, brittle, heavy, light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From whence you may furniſh him with more Examples of Adjectives with Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; as, white Bread, brown Bread, green Graſs, ſoft Cheeſe, hard Cheeſe, black Hat, my black Hat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And then inverting the Order, Subſtantive, Adjective, with the Verb Copulative between. As, Silver is white, Gold is yellow, Lead is heavy, Wood is light, Snow is white, Ink is black, Fleſh is ſoft, Bone is hard, I am ſick, I am not well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will begin to give him ſome Notion of <hi>Syntax.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In like Manner, when Subſtantive and Subſtantive are ſo connected; as Gold is a Metal, a Roſe is a Flower, they are Men, they are Women, Horſes are Beaſts, Geeſe are Fowls, Larks are Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then as thoſe before relate to Quality, you may give him ſome other Words relating to Quantity. As long, ſhort, broad, narrow; thick, thin; high, tall, low; deep, ſhallow, great, big, ſmall (little) much, little; many, few, full, empty; whole, part, piece; all, ſome, none, ſtrong, weak, quick, ſlow, equal, nnequal, bigger, leſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0180400100:72"/>
Then words of figure: As ſtreight, crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, plain, bowed, concave, hollow, convex; round, ſquare, three-ſquare, ſphere, globe, bowl, cube, die, upright, ſloping, leaning forward, leaning backward, like, unlike.</p>
                        <p>Of Geſture; as ſtand, lie, ſit, kneel, ſleep.</p>
                        <p>Of Motion; as move, ſtir, reſt, walk, go, come, run, leap, ride, fall, riſe, ſwim, ſink, drawn, ſlide, creep, crawl, fly, pull, draw, thruſt, throw, bring, fetch, carry.</p>
                        <p>Then Words relating to Time; place, number, weight, meaſure, money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in convenient time, to be ſhewed him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly; for which the teacher according to his Diſcretion, may take a convenient Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                        <p>As likewiſe the Time of the Day; the Days of the Week, the Days of the Month, the Months of the Year; and other Things relating to the <hi>Almanack,</hi> which he will quickly be capable to underſtand, if once Methodically ſhewn him.</p>
                        <p>As likewiſe the Names, and Situation of Places, and Countries, which are conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him to know; which may be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written in his Book, and ſhewed him in the Map of <hi>London, England, Europe,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But theſe may be done at leiſure, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the practice of Arithmetick, and other like Pieces of Learning.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0180400100:73"/>
In the mean time, after the Concord of Subſtantive and Adjective, he is to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by convenient Examples, that of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative</hi> and <hi>Verb.</hi> As for Inſtance: I go, you ſee, he ſits, they ſtand, the fire burns, the ſun ſhines, the wind blows, the rain falls, the water runs; and the like, with the Titles in the top Nominative Verb.</p>
                        <p>After this, (under the Titles Nominative Verb, Accuſative) give him Examples of Verbs Tranſitive; as I ſee you, you ſee me, the fire burns the wood, the Boy makes the fire, the Cook roaſts the meat, the Butler lays the cloath, we eat our dinner.</p>
                        <p>Or even with a double Accuſative; as you teach me writing or to write, <hi>John</hi> teacheth me to Dance, <hi>Thomas</hi> tells me a Tale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After this, you may teach him the Flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Comugation of the Verb, or what is Equivalent thereunto; for in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, each Verb hath but two Tenſes, the Preſent and the Preter, two Participles, the Active and the Paſſive, all the reſt is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Auxiliaries, which Auxiliaries have no more Tenſes than the other Verbs.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Auxiliaries are, do, did, will, would, ſhall, ſhould, may, might, can, could, muſt, ought, to, have, had, am, be, was. And if by Examples you can inſinuate the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe few Words, you have taught him the whole Flexion of the Verb.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0180400100:74"/>
And here it will be convenient, once for all, to write him out a full Paradigm of ſome one Verb, ſuppoſe <hi>to ſee,</hi> through all thoſe Auxiliaries.</p>
                        <p>The Verb itſelf, hath but theſe four Words to be Learned, ſee, ſaw, ſeeing, ſeen, ſave that after thou, in the ſecond Perſon Singular, in both Tenſes, we add <hi>eſt,</hi> and in the Third Perſon Singular, in the Preſent Tenſe <hi>eth</hi> or <hi>es,</hi> or inſtead thereof, <hi>ſt, th, s,</hi> and ſo in all Verbs.</p>
                        <p>Then to the Auxiliaries, do did, will would, ſhall ſhould, may might, can could, muſt ought to, we join the Indefinite ſee. And after have, had, am, be, was, the Paſſive Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſeen, and ſo for all other Verbs.</p>
                        <p>But the Auxiliary <hi>Am</hi> or <hi>Be,</hi> is ſomewhat irregular in a double Form.</p>
                        <p>Am art is: Plural are, was waſt was, Plural were.</p>
                        <p>Be beeſt be: Plural be, were wert were, Plural were.</p>
                        <p>Be, am, was, being, been.</p>
                        <p>Which, attended with the other Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, make us the whole Paſſive Voice.</p>
                        <p>All Verbs, without Exceptions, in the Active Participle are formed by adding <hi>ing,</hi> as ſee ſeeing, teach teaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Preter Tenſe, and the Participle are formed regularly, by adding <hi>ed,</hi> but are oft ſubject to Contractions, and other irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, ſometime the ſame in both, ſometime
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0180400100:75"/>
different, and therefore it is convenient here to give a Table of Verbs, eſpecially, the moſt uſual, for thoſe <hi>three</hi> Caſes, which may at once teach their Signification and Formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as boil boiled, roſt roſted roſted, bake baked baked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> teach taught taught, bring brought brought, buy bought bought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee ſaw ſeen, give gave given, take took taken, forſake forſooke forſaken, write wrote written, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many more fit to be Learned.</p>
                        <p>The Verbs being thus diſpatched, he is then to learn the Prepoſitions; wherein lies the whole Regimen of the Noun. For Diverſity of Caſes we have none, the force of which is to be inſinuated by convenient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, ſuited to their different Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As for Inſtance, Of, a piece <hi>of</hi> Bread, a pint <hi>of</hi> Wine, the colour <hi>of</hi> a Pot, the colour <hi>of</hi> Gold, a ring <hi>of</hi> Gold, a cup <hi>of</hi> Silver, the Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> the longeſt <hi>of</hi> all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in like Manner, for off on upon to unto, till until, from at in within, out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, into out of, about over under, above be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, between among, before behind after, for, by, with, through, againſt, concerning, and by this time he will be pretty well ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to underſtand a ſingle Sentence.</p>
                        <p>In the laſt Place; he is in like Manner to be taught Conjunctions, which ſerve to Connect not Words only, but Sentences, as and alſo, likewiſe, either or whether, neither
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0180400100:76"/>
nor, if then, why, wherefore, becauſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but, though, yet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by convenient Examples in each caſe as, <hi>Becauſe</hi> I am cold, <hi>therefore</hi> I go to the fire, <hi>that</hi> I may be warm, <hi>for</hi> it is cold weather.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>If</hi> it were fair, <hi>then</hi> it would be good walking, but however, <hi>though</hi> it rain, <hi>yet</hi> I muſt go, <hi>becauſe</hi> I promiſed with other like Inſtances.</p>
                        <p>And by this time his Book, if well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with plenty of Words, and thoſe well digeſted under ſeveral Heads, and in good Order, and well recruited from time to time as new Words occur, will ſerve him in the Nature of a <hi>Dictionary</hi> and <hi>Grammar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in caſe the Deaf Perſon be otherwiſe of a good Natural Capacity, and the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a good Sagacity; by this Method, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding gradually ſtep by ſtep, you may, with diligence and due Application of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Learner in a Years Time, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, perceive a greater Progreſs than you would expect, and a good Foundation laid for further Inſtruction in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and other Knowledge which may be taught by Books.</p>
                        <p>It will be convenient all along to have Pen, Ink, and Paper, ready at hand, to write down in a Word, what you ſignifie to him, by Signs, and cauſe him to write, or ſhew how to write, what he ſignifies by Signs; which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0180400100:77"/>
way of ſignifying their mind by Signs, Deaf Perſons are often very good at. And we muſt endeavour to learn their Language, if I may ſo call it, in order to teach them ours; by ſhewing what Words anſwer to their Signs.</p>
                        <p>'Twill be convenient alſo, as you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, after ſome convenient Progreſs made, to expreſs, in as plain Language as may be, the Import of ſome of the Tables; as for Inſtance,</p>
                        <p>The Head is the higheſt part of the Body, the Feet the loweſt part, the Face is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Head, the Forehead is over the Eyes, the Cheeks are under the Eyes, the Noſe is between the Cheeks, the Mouth is under the Noſe, and above the Chin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſuch plain Diſcourſe put into writing, and particularly explained, will teach him by degrees to underſtand plain Sentences; and like Advantages, a Sagacious Teacher may take, as occaſion offers itſelf from Time to Time.</p>

            <p>This Extract is moſtly taken out of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> and lying hid in that little Book, which is but rarely Inquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and too ſcarcely known; dyed in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with that Great Man.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0180400100:78"/>

            <p>One of the chief Perſons, who was taught by Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> was Mr. <hi>Alexander Popham,</hi> Brother-in-Law (if I am not miſtaken) to the preſent Earl of <hi>Oxford;</hi> and he was a very great Proficient in this way; and tho' he was born Deaf and Dumb, underſtood the Language ſo well, as to give under his Hand many rare Indications of a Maſterly Genius.</p>
            <p>The Uncle of his preſent <hi>Sardinian</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, as I have been credibly informed, had the want of the ſame Organs, and yet was a perfect Stateſman, and wrote in five or ſix different Languages Elegantly well.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> in his Book of Travels tells us a Story almoſt incredible; but tells it as a paſſage, that deſerves our belief.

            <p>In <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> there now Lives a Miracle of Wit and good Nature, I mean the Daughter of Mr. <hi>Loggin,</hi> who, tho' born Deaf and Dumb, (and ſhe has a Brother who has the ſame Impediments) yet writes her Mind down upon any Subject with ſuch Acuteneſs, as would Amaze Learned Men themſelves, and put many Students, that have paſſed for Wits, to a Bluſh, to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo far ſurpaſſed by a Woman amidſt that deficiency of the common Organs.

            <p>OUR Young Boy now between ſix and ſeven Years of Age, half a <hi>Highlander</hi> and half a <hi>Laplander,</hi> delighted in wearing a little Bonnet and Plaid, thinking it looked very Manly in his Countrymen, and his Father, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as he was out of his Hanging Sleeves and left off his Boys Veſt, indulged him with that kind of Dreſs, which is truly Antique and Heroick. In this early part of his Nonage he was brought to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> by his Mother in Law, where I my ſelf grew afreſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, his Father being then but lately Dead. Juſt after the Civil Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

and off and on have known him ever ſince, and Converſed with him very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during that ſpace of time which now is about three or four and thirty Years, ſo that whatever I ſay concerning him in the future Pages, I ſhall relate to the Reader from my own certain Knowledge, which, as I reſolve to continue Anonymous, may perhaps not have ſo much Weight and Authority as if I had prefix'd my Name to the Account. Be that as it will, there are hundreds of living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that will juſtifie each Action I relate, and his own future Actions while he lives will procure belief and credit to the precedent ones which I am going to record; ſo that if many do remain Infidels to my Relations and will not allow them Exact (the fate of many as credible and more Important Hiſtorians than my ſelf) I can however venture to flatter my ſelf that greater will be the Number of thoſe, who will have a Faith in my Writings, than of thoſe, who will reject my Accounts as Incredible.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Earl ſetting out firſt, was alſo the firſt at Landing. <hi>Argyll</hi> having attempted to Land in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and being diſappointed by the Vigilance of the Biſhop of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> Landed in the Weſt, and Incamped at <hi>Dunſtafne</hi> Caſtle in the Province of <hi>Lorn,</hi> which had belonged to him. He omitted nothing that might draw over to him all the Malecontents in the Kingdom, whom he thought more Numerous than they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appeared to be. He diſperſed about his Declarations, wherein, after proteſting, that he had taken up Arms only in Defence of Religion and the Laws, againſt an injuſt Uſurper (ſo he Stiled King <hi>James</hi> the Second) he invited all good Proteſtants, and ſuch <hi>Scotch</hi> as would aſſert the Liberty to join him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Prince, he ſaid, was got into the Throne, to ruin the Reformation, and to bring in Popery and Arbitrary Power. Next he ſent Letters to thoſe he thought his Friends, (among whom was Mr. <hi>Archibald Campbell,</hi> who according to the vaſt deference payed by the <hi>Scots</hi> to their Chief, joined him, tho,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0180400100:83"/>
in his heart of a quite different Principle to call them to his Aſſiſtance: He De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached two of his Sons to make Inroades in the Neighbourhood, and compel ſome by Threats, others by mighty Promiſes to join him. All his Contrivances could not raiſe him above three Thouſand Men, with whom he Incamped in the Iſle of <hi>Boot,</hi> where he was ſoon in a manner Beſieged by the Earl of <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> with the King's Forces, and ſeveral other Bodies Commanded by the Duke of <hi>Gordon,</hi> the Marquiſs of <hi>Athol,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and other Great Men, who came from all Parts to quench the Fire before it grew to a Head.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> being obliged to quit a Poſt he could not make good, went over into a Part of the Country of his own Name, where having haſtily Fortified a Caſtle called <hi>Ellingrey,</hi> he put into it the Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition taken out of his Ships, which lay at Anchor under the Cannon of a Fort; he E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected near that Place. There his Rout be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; for going out from the Caſtle with his Forces to make an Incurſion, one of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties was Defeated by the Marquiſs of <hi>Athol,</hi> who ſlew four hundred of his Men; and Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> who Attacked his Ships with ſome of the King's, and took them without any reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0180400100:84"/>
The Earl of <hi>Dunbarton</hi> advancing towards him, at the ſame time, by long Marches, while he Endeavoured to ſecure himſelf by Rivers, ſurprized him paſſing the <hi>Clyde</hi> in the Village of <hi>Killern,</hi> as he was Marching towards <hi>Lenox. Dunbarton</hi> coming upon them at Night, would have ſtaid till the next Day to Attack the Rebels, but they gave him not ſo much time, for they paſſed the River in the Night, in ſuch Confuſion, that being overcome with fear; they diſperſed as ſoon as over. <hi>Argyle</hi> could ſcarce rally ſo many as would make him a ſmall Guard, which was ſoon ſcattered again; <hi>Dunbarton</hi> having paſſed the River, and divided his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to purſue thoſe that fled. <hi>Argyle</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Guides to Conduct him to <hi>Galloway;</hi> but they miſtaking the way, and leading him into a Bog, moſt of thoſe, that ſtill followed him, quitted their Horſes, every Man ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argyle</hi> himſelf was making back alone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Clyde,</hi> when two Reſolute Servants, belonging to an Officer in the King's Army meeting him, tho' they knew him not, bid him Surrender. He fir'd at, and miſſed them; but they took better Aim, and wounded him with a Piſtol Ball. Then the Earl drawing his two Piſtols out of the Holſters, quitted his Horſe, that was quite tired, and took the River. A Country Fellow, who came with thoſe two, that had firſt aſſaulted him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0180400100:85"/>
him with a Piſtol in his Hand; the Earl would have fired one of his, but the flint fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was dangerouſly wounded in the Head, by the Peaſant. He diſcovered himſelf, as he fell Senſeleſs; crying out, <hi>Unfortunate Argyle.</hi> This Nobleman how far ſoever he may be thought miſled in Principle, was certainly in his Perſon a very Brave and a very Gallant Hero. They made haſt to draw him out and bring him to himſelf; after which being delivered up to the Officers, the Erring unfortunate Great Man was Conducted to <hi>Edingburgh</hi> and there Beheaded.</p>
            <p>Many Gentlemen that followed the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of this Great Man, tho' not in his Death they ſhared in all the other Calamities at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his overthrow. They moſt of them fled into the remoteſt Iſles and the obſcureſt corners of all <hi>Scotland:</hi> Contented with the ſaving of their Lives; they grew Exiles and Baniſhed Men of their own making, and Abdicated their Eſtates before they were known to be Forfeited, becauſe, for fear of being informed againſt by the Common Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows they Commanded, they durſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to lay their Claims. Of this Number was Mr. <hi>Archibald Campbell,</hi> and this new Diſaſter wounded him deep into the very Heart, after ſo many late miſadventures, and ſent him untimely to the Grave. He perfectly pined away and waſted; he was ſix Months dying Inch by Inch, and the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between his leaſt Breath and his way
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0180400100:86"/>
of Breathing during all that time, was only, that he Expired with a greater Sigh than he ordinarily fetched every time when he drew his Breath.</p>
            <p>Every thing the <hi>Lapland</hi> Lady had Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted ſo long before, being thus come to paſs, we may the leſs admire at the wonders performed by her Son, when we conſider this faculty of Divination to be ſo derived to him from her, and Grown as it were Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.</p>
            <p>Our Young Prophet, who had taught moſt of his little Companions to converſe with him by Finger, was the Head at every little Paſtime and Game they Played at. Marbles (which he uſed to call Children's playing at Bowls) yielded him mighty Diverſion; and he was ſo dexterous and Artiſt at ſhooting that little Alablaſter Globe from between the end of his fore-finger and the knuckle of his Thumb, that he ſeldom miſſed hitting <hi>Plum</hi> (as the Boys call it) the Marble he aimed at, tho' at the diſtance of two or three yards. The Boys always when they played coveted to have him on their ſide, and by hearing that he foretold other things, uſed to conſult him, when they made their little Matches (which were things of great Importance in their Thoughts) who ſhould get the Victory. He uſed commonly to leave theſe trifles undeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but if ever he gave his Opinion in theſe trivial Affairs, the Perſons fared well by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0180400100:87"/>
their Conſultation, for his Judgment about them was like a petty Oracle, and the end always Anſwered his Prediction. But I would have my Reader imagin (that tho' our <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> was himſelf but a Boy) He was not conſulted only by Boys; his Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration and Inſight into things of a high Nature, got Air, and being atteſted by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Witneſſes won him the Eſteem of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Mature Years and Diſcretion.</p>
            <p>If a Beautiful young Virgin languiſhed for a Husband; or a Widow's Mind was in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have a ſecond venture of Infants by another Spouſe: If a Houſekeeper had loſt any thing belonging to her Maſter, ſtill little <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> was at Hand; he was the Oracle to be applied to, and the little Chalk'd Circle, where he was diverting himſelf with his play-fellows near the Croſs at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> was frequented with as much ſolicitation and as much credit, as the <hi>Tripos</hi> of <hi>Apollo</hi> was at <hi>Delphos</hi> in Ancient times.</p>
            <p>It was highly Entertaining to ſee a Young Blooming Beauty come and ſlily pick up the Boy from his Company, carry him home with as much eagerneſs as ſhe would her Gallant, becauſe ſhe knew ſhe ſhould get the Name of her Gallant out of him before he went, and bribe him with a Sugar Plumb to write down the Name of a Young <hi>Scotch</hi> Peer in a green Ribbon that her Mouth watered after.</p>

How often after he has been wallowing in the duſt have I my ſelf ſeen nice ſqueamiſh Widows help him up in their gilded Chariots and give him a Pleaſant ride with them, that he might tell them they ſhould not long lie a lone; little <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> had as much buſineſs upon his Hands as the Parſons of all the Pariſhes in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly was conſulted and named the Couples before the Miniſter joined them; thus he grew a rare Cuſtomer to the Toyſhop, from whence he moſt an end received Fees and Rewards for his Advices. If Lady <hi>Betty</hi> ſuch a one was foretold that ſhe ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have Beau ſuch a one in Marriage; then little <hi>Duncan</hi> was ſure to have a Hobby-Horſe from the Toyſhop as a Reward for the promiſed Fop. If ſuch a Widow that was ugly but very Rich, was to be puſhed hard for as ſhe pretended (tho' in reality ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily won) little <hi>Duncan</hi> upon enſuring her ſuch a Captain or ſuch a Lieutenant Colonel, was ſure to be preſented from the ſame Child's Warehouſe with a very handſome Drum, and a Silver'd Trumpet.</p>

If a Houſekeeper loſt any Plate, the Thief was certain to be catched, provided ſhe took little Maſter into the Store-Room, and asked him the Queſtion, after ſhe had given him his Belly full of Sweet-Meats,</p>
            <p>Neither were the Women only his conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the Grave Merchants, who were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious for many ventures at Sea, applied to the Boy for his Opinion of their ſecurity, and they looked upon his Opinion to be as ſafe as the Inſurance Office for Ships.

            <p>I my ſelf knew one Count <hi>Cog</hi> an Eminent Gameſter, who was a Perſon ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Credulous Diſpoſition that he was an unbeliever in ſeveral Points of Religion, and the next Door to an Infidel. Yet as much as he was a Stranger to Faith, he was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered and overpowered ſo far, in his incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by the Strange Events, which he had ſeen come frequently to paſs from the Predictions of this Child, that he had commonly daily acceſs to this Boy to learn his more adverſe and more proſperous Hours of Gaming. At
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0180400100:90"/>
firſt indeed he would try, when the Child foretold him his ill Fortune, whether it would prove true, and relying upon the mere hazard and turn of the Dye, he had always (as he obſerved) a run of ill Luck on thoſe forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Days, as he never fail'd of good if he choſe the fortunate Hours directed by the Boy. One time above all the reſt, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was departing from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and when the Seaſon of Gaming was almoſt over, moſt Perſons of Wealth and Diſtinction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing for Pleaſure to their Seats in the Country, he came to young <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> to conſult; and was extremely ſolicitous to know, how happily or unluckily he ſhould end that <hi>Term</hi> (as we may call it) of the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>weighty Buſineſs, viz.

This Art of Prediction is not attainable any otherwiſe, than by theſe Three Ways; firſt it is done by the Company of Familiar Spirits and Genii, which are of Two Sorts; ſome Good and ſome Bad; who tell the gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perſon the things of which he informs other People. 2<hi>dly,</hi> It is perform'd by the Second Sight, which is very various, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in moſt of the Poſſeſſors, it being but a very little in ſome, very extenſive and conſtant in others; beginning with ſome in their Infancy, and leaving them before they come to Years; happening to others in a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Age, to others again in an old Age that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had it before and laſting only for a term of Years, and now and then for a very ſhort period of Time; and in ſome intermitting, like fits as it were of Viſion, that leave them for a time, and then return to be as ſtrong in them as ever, and it being in a manner Hereditary to ſome Families, whoſe Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren have it from their Infancy without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a great old Age, and even to the time of their Death, which they often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell before it comes to paſs to a Day, nay even to an Hour. 3<hi>dly,</hi> It is attain'd by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Study of the lawful Part of the Art of Magick.</p>

            <p>One Day, I remember, when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Nine Years of Age, going early to the Houſe, where he and his Mother liv'd, and it being before his Mother was ſtirring, I went into little <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi>'s Room to divert myſelf with him, I found him ſitting up in his Bed with his Eyes broad open, but as motionleſs as if he had been aſleep, or even (if it had not been for a lively beautiful Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour which the little pretty fair Silver Hair'd Boy always had in his Cheeks) as if he had
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0180400100:95"/>
been quite dead; he did not ſeem ſo much as to breath; the Eylids of him were ſo fix'd and immovable, that the Eylaſhes did not ſo much as once ſhake, which the leaſt Motion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable muſt agitate; not to ſay that he was like a Perſon in an <hi>Exſtacy,</hi> he was at leaſt in what (we commonly call) a <hi>Brown Study</hi> to the higheſt degree, and for the largeſt ſpace of time I ever knew. I, who had been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inform'd by People, who have been preſent at the Operations of Second Sighted Perſons, that, at the Sight of a Viſion, the Eylids of the Perſon are erected, and the Eyes continue ſtaring till the Object vaniſhes, I (Iſay) ſate myſelf ſoftly down on his Bed-ſide, and with a quiet Amazement obſerv'd him, avoiding diligently any Motion, that might give him the leaſt diſturbance, or cauſe in him any avocation or diſtraction of Mind from the Buſineſs he was ſo intent upon.

            <p>Placing the Paper upon his Knees he wrote me the following Lines, which together with my Anſwers I preſerve by me, for their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to this very Day, and which I have tranſcribed Word for Word, as they form a little Series of Dialogue.</p>
            <p>Duncan Campbell. <hi>I am ſorry I cant ſtay with you; but I ſhall ſee my pretty Youth and my Lamb by, and by, in the Fields, near a little Coppice, or Grove, where I go often to play with them, and I would not loſe their Company for the whole World; for they and I are mighty familiar to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Boy tells me every thing, that gets me my Reputation among the Ladies and Nobility, and you muſt keep it Secret.</hi>

            <p>Duncan Campbell. <hi>Yeſs he did, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, that he had ſeveral things to predict to me, concerning People, that, he fore-knew, would come to me, the Week following, to ask me Queſtions.</hi>

               <hi>My Queſtion.</hi> But what was you ſtaring at, when I came in?</p>
            <p>Duncan Campbell. <hi>Why, at that little Boy,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>My Queſtion.</hi> How does he do it? Does he write?</p>
            <p>Duncan Campbell. <hi>No, he writes ſometimes, but oftner he ſpeaks with his Fingers, and mighty ſwift; No Man can do it ſo quick, or write half ſo ſoon; he has a little Bell in his Hand, like that, which my Mother makes me a Sign to ſhake, when ſhe wants the Servants; with That he tickles my Brain ſtrangely, and gives me an incredible Delight of</hi> feeling <hi>in the</hi> inſide <hi>of my Head; he uſually wakes me with it in the Morning, when he comes to make me an Appointment. I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, 'tis what you call</hi> Hearing, <hi>which makes me mighty deſirous I could</hi> hear <hi>in your way; 'tis ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the feeling, methinks, than any thing is to the taſt; It is juſt as if my Head was tickled to Death, as my Nurſe uſed to tickle my Sides; but 'tis a different feeling, for it makes things like little Strings, tremble in my Temples, and behind my Ears. Now I remember, I will tell you what 'tis like, that makes me believe 'tis like your</hi> Hearing, <hi>and that ſtrange thing, which you, that can ſpeak, call Sound or Noiſe: Becauſe, when I was at Church with my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who told me the Bells could be heard ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Mile off: As I was kneeling on the Bench, and leaning over the top of the Pew and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Board, every time, the Man pull'd the Rope, I thought all my Head beat, as if it would come to Pieces, but yet it pleaſed me,</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0180400100:99"/>
               <hi>methought, rather than pain'd me, and I would be always gnawing the Board, when the Man pull'd the Rope, and I told my Mother the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: The feeling of that was ſomething like the little Bell, but only</hi> that <hi>made my Head</hi> throb <hi>as if it would break, and</hi> this tickles <hi>me and makes, as it were, little Strings on the back of my Ears dance and tremble like any thing, is not that like your way of</hi> Hearing?—<hi>If it be it is a ſweet thing to hear.—It is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant than to ſee the fineſt Colours in the World,—it is ſomething like being tickled in the Noſe with a Feather till one Sneezes, or like the feeling, after one ſtrikes the Leg, when it has been numb or aſleep, only with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that thoſe Two ways give a Pain and the other a Pleaſure; I remember too, when I had a great Cold for about Two Months, I had a feeling ſomething like it, but that was blunt, dull, confus'd and troubleſome. Is not this like what you call</hi> Hearing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Queſtion.</hi> It is the fineſt kind of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my Dear, it is what we call Muſick. But what ſort of a Boy is that, that meets you? And what ſort of a Lamb?</p>
            <p>Duncan Campbell. <hi>Oh! tho' they are like other Boys and other Lambs which you ſee, they are a Thouſand Times prettier and finer; you never ſaw ſuch a Boy nor ſuch a Lamb in your Life-time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Queſtion.</hi> How big is he? As big as you are? And what ſort of a Boy is he?</p>

Duncan Campbell. <hi>He is a little little pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Boy, about as tall as my Knee, his Face is as white as Snow, and ſo are his little Hands; his Cheeks are as red as a Cherry, and ſo are his Lips; and, when he Breaths, it makes the Air more perfum'd than my Mother's ſweet Baggs that ſhe puts among the Linnen; he has got a Crown of Roſes, Cowſlips, and other Flowers upon his Head, ſuch as the Maids gather in</hi> May; <hi>his Hair is like fine Silver Threads, and ſhine like the Beams of the Sun; he wears a looſe Veil down to his Feet, that is as Blue as the Sky in a clear Day, and embroider'd with Spangles, that look like the brighteſt Stars in the Night; he carries a Silver Bell in one Hand, and a Book and Pencil in the other; and he and the little Lamb will dance and leap about me in a Ring as high as my Head; the Lamb has got a little Silver Collar with Nine little Bells upon it; and every little piece of Wooll upon its Back, that is as white Milk, is tied up all round it in Puffs like a little Miſſes Hair, with Ribbons of all Colours; and round its Head too are little Roſes and Violets ſtuck very thick into the Wooll that grows upon its Forehead, and behind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its Ears in the Shape of a Diadem. They firſt meet me dancing thus; and after they have danc'd ſometime, the little Boy writes down wonderful things in his Book, which I write down in mine; then they dance again, till he rings his Bell, and then they are gone</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0180400100:101"/>
               <hi>all of a ſudden I know not where; but I feel the tickling in the inſide of my Head caus'd by the Bell leſs and leſs, 'til I don't feel it at all, and then I go home, read over my Leſſon in my Book, and when I have it by heart, I burn the written Leaves, according as the little Boy bids me, or he would let me have no more. But I hear the little Bell again, the little Boy is angry with me, he</hi> pull'd <hi>me</hi> Twice <hi>by the</hi> Ear, <hi>and I would not diſpleaſe him for any thing; ſo I muſt get up and go immediately, to the Joy and Delight of my Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told him he might, if he would promiſe me to tell me further another time; he ſaid he would, if I would keep it ſecret. I told him I would, and ſo we parted; tho' juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went, he ſaid he <hi>ſmelt</hi> ſome Veniſon, and he was ſure they would ſhortly have ſome for Dinner; and nothing was ſo ſure as that, my Man had my Orders to bring a Side of Veniſon to me the next Day to Mrs. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>'s, for I had been hunting, and came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the death of a Deer that Morning; and intended as uſual to make a ſtay there for Two or Three Days.</p>
            <p>There are I know many Men of ſevere Principles, and who are more Strict, Grave and Formal, in their manner of thinking, than they are Wiſe; who will be apt to judge of theſe relations, as things merely Fabulous and Chimerical, and, not contented with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſ-believers by themſelves, will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0180400100:102"/>
to inſinuate into others this pernicious Notion, that it is a ſign of Infirmity and Weakneſs in the Head, to yield them Credit. But tho' I could eaſily argue theſe <hi>Sir Gravities</hi> down; tho' a Sentence or Two would do their Buſineſs, put them beyond the Power of replying, and ſtrike them Dumb, yet do I thing it not worth my while; their greateſt and moſt wonted Objection againſt theſe <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demons</hi> and <hi>Kakodemons,</hi> being, that it ariſes all from the work of fancy, in Perſons of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Blood. If we conſider the nature of this Child's Dialogue with me, will it not be more whimſically ſtrange and miraculous, to ſay, that a Child of Nine Years old had only a fancy of ſuch things as theſe, of which it had never heard any Body give an account, and that it could by the mere ſtrength of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination predict ſuch things as really after came to paſs, than it is (when it does ſo ſtrangely predict things) to believe the Child does it, in the <hi>manner</hi> itſelf owns it does, which is by the intervention of a good <hi>Demon,</hi> or a happy Genius. Departing therefore from theſe ſingular wiſe Mens Opinions, who will believe nothing Excellent can happen to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which it has not been their Lot to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a ſhare of, I ſhall take my farewel haſtily of them (without looſing my own time or theirs) in the Words of the ingenious and learned Monſieur <hi>le Clerc. Acerbos homines non Moror, Indignos quippe, qui haec ſtudia</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall rather ſee how far theſe things have lain open to the Eyes of, and been explain'd by the ancient Sages; I will relate who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them were happy in their <hi>Genii,</hi> and who among the Moderns, whoſe Examples may be Authorities for our Belief; I will ſet down as clearly as I can, what Perception Men have had of <hi>Genii</hi> or Spirits, by the ſenſe of ſeeing, what by the ſenſe of hearing, what by the ſenſe of feeling, touching or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and in fine, what Perception others have had of theſe <hi>Genii</hi> by all the Senſes, what by Dreams and what by Magick, a thing rarely to be met with at once in any ſingle Man, and which ſeems particular to the Child, who was the Subject of our laſt little hiſtorical Account. When I have brought Examples and the Opinions of wiſe Philoſophers, and the Evidence of undeniable Witneſſes, which one would think ſufficient to evince Perſons of the Commerce Men have with Spirits, if they were not paſt all ſenſe of Conviction: I ſhall, not ſo much to corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what I ſay, as to ſhame ſome Wiſeacres, who would by their frail Reaſon ſcan all things, and pretend to ſolve the Myſteries aſcribed to Spirits as Facts merely natural, and who would baniſh from the Thoughts of Men all belief of Spirits whatſoever, I ſhall I ſay (in order to put to ſhame theſe Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acres,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0180400100:104"/>
if they have any Shame left) produce the Opinions of the Fathers as Divines, ſhew the Doctrines of Spirits in general to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Chriſtianity, that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in the Scripture and by Chriſtian Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in which if they will not acquieſce, I ſhall leave them to the Labyrinth of their own wild Opinions, which in the end will ſo perplex their Judgments of things, that they will be never able to extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and theſe different Heads will be the Subject of the Chapter enſuing, and will (or I am greatly miſtaken) form both an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive edifying and entertaining Diſcourſe, for a Reader really and truly intelligent, and that has a good taſte and reliſh for ſublime things.</p>

            <p>IT is ſaid in the Ninth Book of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it is better to come at the probable Knowledge of ſome things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us in the Heavens, than to be capable of giving many Demonſtrations relating to things here below, This is no doubt an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Propoſition, and ſpeaks the lofty aims
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0180400100:105"/>
of that ſublime Mind from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Among all the diſquiſitions in this kind, none ſeem to me more excellent, than thoſe, which treat concerning the <hi>Genii,</hi> that attend upon Men and guide them in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Life. A Genius or <hi>Demon</hi> of the good Kind is a ſort of mediate Being, between Humane and Divine, which gives the Mind of Man a pleaſant Conjunction with Angelick and Celeſtial Faculties, and brings down to Earth a faint participation of the Joys of Heaven. That there have been ſuch fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Attendants upon wiſe Men, we have many rare Inſtances. They have been aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Socrates, Ariſtotle, Plotinus, Porphyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Jamblicus, Chicus, Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Cardan.</hi> The moſt celebrated of all theſe Ancients was <hi>Socrates;</hi> and as for his having a Genius or <hi>Demon,</hi> we have the Teſtimonies of <hi>Plato, Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Antiſthenes,</hi> his Contemporaries, confirm'd by <hi>Laertius, Plutarch, Maximus Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Dion Chryſoſtonius, Cicero, Apuleius, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> and others, many of the Moderns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus, Auſtin</hi> and others; and <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Theage,</hi> ſays: <hi>By ſome Divine Lot I have a certain</hi> Demon, <hi>which has followed me from my Childhood as an Oracle;</hi> and in the ſame place intimates that the way he gain'd his Inſtruction was by hearing the <hi>Demon</hi>'s Voice.

ſo well atteſted with ſuch an air of Truth, as to make the Truth of the Hiſtory doubted by others as well as themſelves, where no demonſtrative Proof can be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them. This has been the eaſy Task of thoſe who object againſt the <hi>Demon</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates;</hi> but when no demonſtrative Proof is to be had on either ſide, does not Wiſdom incline us to lean to the moſt Probable? Let us then conſider whether the Evidences are not more credible, and Witneſſes of ſuch a thing are not Perſons of more Authority, than <hi>theſe</hi> Men are, who vouchſafe to give <hi>no</hi> reaſon but their own <hi>Incredulity</hi> for maintaining the contrary, and whether <hi>thoſe</hi> therefore by the right rule of judging, ought not much ſooner than <hi>theſe,</hi> to gain over our Aſſent to their Aſſertions?</p>

Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> in his Collections of Relations, for proving Apparitions, Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tells us of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Man, that had like to have been carried away by Spirits, and of the Ghoſt of a Man who had been Seven Years dead, that brought a Medicine to his Bed-ſide.</p>
               <p>The Relation is thus.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman in <hi>Ireland,</hi> near to the Earl of <hi>Orrery</hi>'s ſending his Butler one After-noon to buy Cards; as he paſs'd a Field, to his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he eſpy'd a Company of People ſitting round a Table, with a deal of good Cheer before them, in the mid'ſt of the Field: And he going up towards them they all aroſe and ſaluted him, and deſir'd him to ſit down with them; but one of them wiſper'd theſe Words in his Ear.—<hi>Do nothing this Company invites you to.</hi> Hereupon he refus'd to ſit down at the Table, and immediately Table and all that belong'd to it were gone, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are now dancing and playing upon Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtruments. And the Butler being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to join himſelf with them, but he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this alſo, they all fall to Work, and he not being to be prevail'd with, to accompany them in working any more than in feaſting or dancing, they all diſ-appear'd, and the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is now alone, but inſtead of going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, home he returns, as faſt as he could drive, in a great Conſternation; and was no ſooner enter'd his Maſter's Door, but he fell down and lay ſometime Senſeleſs, but coming
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0180400100:108"/>
again to himſelf, he related to his Maſter what had paſſed.</p>
               <p>The Night following there comes one of his Company to his Bed-ſide, and tells him, <hi>that if he offered to ſtir out of the Doors the next Day, he would be carried away.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he kept within; but towards the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning having need to make Water, he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to put one Foot over the Threſhold, ſeveral ſtanding by, which he had no ſooner done but they eſpy'd a Rope caſt about his Middle; and the poor Man was hurried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with great Swiftneſs, they following him as faſt as they could, but could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake him, at length they eſpy'd an Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man coming towards him, and made Signs to him to ſtop the Man whom he ſaw co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming near him, and both ends of the Rope, but nobody drawing; when they met he laid hold of one end of the Rope, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately had a ſmart blow given him over his Arm with the other end; but by this means the Man was ſtopp'd, and the Horſe-man brought him back with him.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Orrery</hi> hearing of theſe ſtrange Paſſages, ſent to the Maſter to deſire him to ſend this Man to his Houſe, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did, and the Morning following or quickly after, he told the Earl that his <hi>Spectre</hi> had been with him again, and aſſur'd him that that Day he ſhould moſt certainly be carry'd away, and that no Endeavors ſhould
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0180400100:109"/>
avail to the ſaving of him; upon this he was kept in a large Room with a conſiderable Number of Perſons to guard him, among whom was the famous Stroaker Mr. <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> who was a Neighbour. There were beſide other Perſons of Quality, Two Biſhops in the Houſe at the ſame time, who were conſulted concerning the making uſe of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, the <hi>Spectre</hi> or <hi>Ghoſt</hi> preſcrib'd, of which mention will be made anon, but they determin'd on the Negative.</p>
               <p>Till part of the Afternoon was ſpent all was quiet, but at length he was perceiv'd to riſe from the Ground, whereupon Mr. <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> and another luſty Man clapt their Arms over his Shoulders, one of them before him and the other behind, and weigh'd him down with all their Strength; but he was forcibly taken up from them, and they were too weak to keep their hold, and for a conſiderable time he was carry'd into the Air, to and fro over their Heads, ſeveral of the Company ſtill running under him to prevent his receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, if he ſhould fall, at length he fell, and was caught before he came to the Ground and had by that means no hurt.</p>
               <p>All being quiet till Bed-time, <hi>My LORD</hi> order'd Two of his Servants to lie with him, and the next Morning he told his Lordſhip, that his <hi>Spectre</hi> was again with him, and brought a wooden Diſh with grey Liquor in it and bid him drink it off; at the firſt ſight
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0180400100:110"/>
of the <hi>Spectre</hi> he ſaid he endeavour'd to awake his Bed-fellows, but it told him, that that Endeavour ſhould be in vain; and that he had no cauſe to fear him, he being his Friend, and he that at firſt gave him the good Advice in the Field, which had he not followed, he had been before now perfectly in the Power of the Company he ſaw there; he added, that he concluded it was impoſſible, but that he ſhould have been carried away the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there being ſo ſtrong a Combination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; but now he could aſſure him there would be more Attempts of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but he being troubled with Two ſorts of ſad Fits, he had brought that Liquor to cure him of them, and bid him drink it; he peremptorily refuſing, the <hi>Spectre</hi> was angry, and upbraided him with great diſ-ingenuity, but told him, however, he had a kindneſs for him, and that if he would take <hi>Plantane Juice,</hi> he ſhould be well of one ſort of Fits, but he ſhould carry the other to his Grave: the poor Man having by this ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd himſelf, ask'd the <hi>Spectre</hi> whether by the juice of <hi>Plantane</hi> he meant that of the <hi>Leaves</hi> or <hi>Roots?</hi> It reply'd the <hi>Roots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then it ask'd him whether he did not know him? He anſwer'd no; it reply'd I am ſuch a one: The Man anſwer'd, he had been long dead: I have been dead, ſaid the <hi>Spectre</hi> or <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> Seven Years, and you know, that I liv'd a looſe Life, and ever ſince I have

been hurried up and down in a reſtleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the Company you ſaw, and ſhall be to the Day of Judgment: Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to tell him, that had he acknowledg'd God in his ways, he had not ſuffer'd ſuch ſevere things by their Means; and further ſaid, you never pray'd to God that Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you met with this Company in the Fields.</p>
               <p>This Relation was ſent to Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> by Mr. <hi>E.

               <p>A Viſion which happened to the ingenious and learned Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> may not improperly be here inſerted.

To which Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> was not able to make a <hi>preſent</hi> Anſwer; but after a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>perplex'd Pauſe,</hi> did at laſt ſay, I have <hi>ſeen a dreadful Viſion,</hi> ſince I ſaw you, I have <hi>ſeen</hi> my <hi>dear Wife</hi> paſs Twice by me, through this Room, with her <hi>Hair hanging</hi> about her <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and a <hi>dead Child</hi> in <hi>her Arms,</hi> this I have ſeen ſince I ſaw you. To which Sir <hi>Robert</hi> reply'd, <hi>ſure,</hi> Sir, you have <hi>ſlept,</hi> ſince I ſaw you, and this is the Reſult of ſome <hi>melancholy Dream,</hi> which I deſire you to <hi>forget,</hi> for you are now <hi>awake.</hi> To which Dr. <hi>Donne</hi>'s reply was, I cannot be <hi>ſurer</hi> that I <hi>now live,</hi> than that I have <hi>not ſlept</hi> ſince I ſaw you, and am as <hi>ſure</hi> at her <hi>Second appearing ſhe</hi> ſtop'd and <hi>look'd</hi> me in the <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>vaniſh'd.

and bring him Word whether Mrs. <hi>Donne</hi> were alive; and if alive, what <hi>Condition</hi> ſhe was in as to her Health; The Twelfth Day the Meſſenger return'd with this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: That he found and left Mrs. <hi>Donne</hi> very <hi>Sad</hi> and <hi>Sick</hi> in Bed, and that after a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> Labour, ſhe had been deliver'd of a <hi>dead</hi> Child, and upon <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> the Abortion prov'd to be the <hi>ſame Day,</hi> and about the <hi>very Hour,</hi> that Dr. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> affirm'd <hi>he ſaw her</hi> paſs by in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

ſo that only a Sound, Voice or Noiſe, is perceived by Men, <hi>viz.</hi> a Stroke, Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whiſtling, Sneezing, Groaning, Lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or clapping of the Hands, to make Men attent to Enquire or Anſwer.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Colloquia Menſalia, &amp;c.</hi> ſet forth in <hi>Latin</hi> at <hi>Francfort, Anno</hi> 1557. it being a different Collection from that of <hi>Aurifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which is tranſlated from <hi>High Dutch</hi> into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We have the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>It happen'd in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> that as a certain Boy was Born, there preſently came to him a <hi>Genius,</hi> or what you pleaſe to call it (for I leave it to Mens Judgments) who had ſo faithful a Care of the Infant, that there was no need either of Mother or Servant; and, as he grew up, he had a like care of him: He went to School with him, but <hi>ſo,</hi> that he could never be <hi>ſeen,</hi> either by <hi>himſelf,</hi> or any <hi>others</hi> in <hi>all</hi> his Life. Afterwards he travelled into <hi>Italy,</hi> he accompanied him, and, whenſoever any Evil was like to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to him, either on the Road or in the Inn, he was perceiv'd to foretel it by ſome Touch or Stroke; he drew off his Boots as a Servant; if he turn'd his Journey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way, he continued with him, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame care of him in foretelling E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; at length he was made a <hi>Canon,</hi> and as, on a time, he was ſitting and feaſting with his Friends, in much Jollity, a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Stroke was ſtruck on a ſudden, on the Table, ſo that they were all terrify'd; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the <hi>Canon</hi> ſaid to his Friends, be not afraid, ſome great Evil hangs over my Head. The next Day he fell into a great Fever, and the Fit continued on him for Three whole Days, till he died, miſerably.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Henry Bell</hi> in his Narrative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd to <hi>Luther</hi>'s Table, printed in <hi>Engliſh, Anno,</hi> 1652. having acquainted us how the <hi>German</hi> Copy printed of it had been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd under Ground, where it had lain hid Fifty Two Years, that Edition having been ſuppreſt by an Edict of the Emperor <hi>Rudol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> II. ſo that it was Death for any Perſon to keep a Copy thereof, and having told us that <hi>Caſparus Van Spar</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Gentleman, with whom he was familiarly acquainted, while he negotiated Affairs in <hi>Germany</hi> for King <hi>James</hi> I. was the Perſon that diſcover'd it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1626. and tranſmitted it into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to him, and earneſtly deſired him to Tranſlate the ſaid Book into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſays, he accordingly ſet upon the Tranſlation of it many times, but was always hinder'd from Proceeding in it by ſome intervening Buſineſs. About Six Weeks after he had receiv'd the Copy, being in Bed with his Wife one Night, between Twelve and One of the Clock, ſhe being aſleep, but himſelf awake, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him an <hi>ancient Man</hi> ſtanding at his Bed's-ſide array'd all <hi>in White,</hi> having a <hi>long</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0180400100:116"/>
and <hi>broad white Beard,</hi> hanging down to his <hi>Girdle,</hi> who taking him by his <hi>right Ear</hi> ſaid thus to him, Sirrah! Will you not take time to Tranſlate that Book, which is ſent unto you out of <hi>Germany?</hi> I will ſhortly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for you both <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> to do it, and then he <hi>vaniſh'd:</hi> Hereupon being much affrighted he fell into an extream <hi>Sweat,</hi> ſo that his Wife awaking and finding him all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Wet,</hi> ſhe ask'd him what he ail'd? He told her what he had <hi>ſeen and heard;</hi> but he never regarded Viſions nor Dreams, and ſo the ſame fell out of his Mind. But a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after, being on a Sunday at his Lodging in <hi>King's-ſtreet, Weſtminſter,</hi> at Dinner with his Wife, Two Meſſengers were ſent from the whole Counſel-board, with a Warrant to carry him to the <hi>Gate-houſe Weſtminſter,</hi> there to be kept till further Order from the Lords of the Council; upon which Warrant he was kept there <hi>Ten</hi> whole Years cloſe Priſoner, where he ſpent <hi>Five Years</hi> of it in <hi>Tranſlating</hi> the <hi>ſaid Book,</hi> having <hi>good Cauſe</hi> to be mindful of the <hi>old Man's ſaying:</hi> I will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide for you both <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> to <hi>Tranſlate</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Perception of Spirits chiefly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>ſeeing</hi> Faculties, yet are not the <hi>other Senſes</hi> without ſome <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation</hi> of theſe <hi>genial Objects,</hi> whether <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil;</hi> for as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, the evil Work of the Devil creeps through all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0180400100:117"/>
the Paſſages of the Senſes; he preſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Figures; applies himſelf to Colours, adheres to Sounds, introduces Odors, infuſes himſelf in Savors, and fills all the Paſſages of Intelligence; ſometimes cruelly torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Grief and Fear, ſometimes ſporting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diverting Man or taunting with Mocks; and on the other Hand, as the learned <hi>Wab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hilton</hi> (a great Maſter of contemplative Life) in his Scale of Perfection, ſets forth, that Appearances or Repreſentations to the corporeal Senſes, may be both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I conclude upon this Head, to give ſtill more Weight and Authority to the Perception Men have had of theſe <hi>Genii,</hi> both by the Senſes of <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>ſeeing,</hi> I will relate Two very remarkable Fragments of Hiſtory of this kind, told us by Perſons who demand our Credit, and done within the Memory of our Grandfathers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The firſt is concerning that Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> who was ſtab'd by <hi>Felton, Auguſt</hi> the Twenty Third 1628.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> in his Book enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Monarchy or no Monarchy in</hi> England, printed in Quarto, 1651. Having mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> writes as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. <hi>Since I am upon the Death of</hi> Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, <hi>I ſhall relate a true Story of his being</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0180400100:118"/>
                  <hi>admoniſhed often, of the Death he ſhould die, in this Manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An aged Gentleman, one <hi>Parker,</hi> as I now remember, having formerly belonged unto the Duke, or of great Acquaintance with the Duke's Father, and now retired, had a <hi>Demon</hi> appeared ſeveral Times to him in the ſhape of Sir <hi>George Villiers,</hi> the Duke's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This <hi>Demon</hi> walk'd many Times in <hi>Parker</hi>'s Bed-chamber, without any Action of Terror, Noiſe, Hurt or Speech; but at laſt, one Night, broke out in theſe Words: Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> I know you loved me formerly, and my Son <hi>George</hi> at this Time very well, I would have you go from me, (you know me very well to be his Father old Sir <hi>George Villiers</hi> of <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi>) and acquaint him with <hi>theſe</hi> and <hi>theſe Particulars, &amp;c.</hi> and that he <hi>above all refrain</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch,</hi> whom he then <hi>nominated,</hi> or elſe he will come to <hi>Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and that <hi>ſuddenly. Parker,</hi> though a very <hi>diſcreet</hi> Man, partly imagined himſelf in a Dream all this Time; and being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to proceed upon no better Grounds, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore addreſſing himſelf to the Duke; for he conceived, if he ſhould acquaint the Duke with the Words of his Father, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his appearance to him, (ſuch Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions being not uſual) he ſhould be <hi>laugh'd at,</hi> and thought to <hi>Doat,</hi> in regard he was <hi>aged.</hi> Some few Nights paſt without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0180400100:119"/>
Trouble to the old Man, but not very many Nights after, old Sir <hi>George Villiers</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared again, walk'd quick and furiouſly in the Room, ſeem'd angry with <hi>Parker,</hi> and at laſt ſaid, Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> I thought you had been my Friend ſo much, and loved my Son <hi>George</hi> ſo well, that you would have acquainted him with what I deſired, but I know you have not done it; by all the Friendſhip that ever was betwixt <hi>you</hi> and <hi>me,</hi> and the great <hi>Reſpect</hi> you bear <hi>my Son,</hi> I <hi>deſire</hi> you to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,</hi> what I formerly commanded you, to <hi>my Son.</hi> The old Man ſeeing himſelf thus ſollicited, promiſed the <hi>Demon</hi> he would, but firſt argued it thus, that the Duke was not <hi>eaſy</hi> to be <hi>ſpoken</hi> withal, and that <hi>he</hi> would account <hi>him</hi> a <hi>vain Man</hi> to <hi>come</hi> with <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Meſſage</hi> from the <hi>Dead;</hi> nor did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Duke</hi> would give <hi>any Credit</hi> to him; to which the <hi>Demon</hi> thus anſwer'd. If he will <hi>not</hi> believe you have this Diſcourſe from me, tell him of <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Secret</hi> (and nam'd it) which he knows <hi>none</hi> in the World ever knew but <hi>myſelf</hi> and <hi>him.</hi> Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now <hi>well ſatisfy'd</hi> that he was <hi>not</hi> aſleep, and that the <hi>Apparition</hi> was <hi>not</hi> a <hi>vain Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> took a fit Opportunity, and ſeriouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the <hi>Duke</hi> with his <hi>Father's Words,</hi> and the <hi>manner</hi> of his <hi>Apparition.</hi> The <hi>Duke laugh'd heartily</hi> at the Relation, which put old <hi>Parker</hi> to a ſtand, but at laſt he aſſumed Courage, and told the Duke that he acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0180400100:120"/>
his Father's Ghoſt, with what he found now to be true, <hi>viz. Scorn</hi> and <hi>Deriſion;</hi> but my Lord, ſays he, your Father bid me acquaint you by <hi>this Token,</hi> and he ſaid it was <hi>ſuch</hi> as none in the World but your <hi>Two ſelves</hi> did yet know; <hi>hereat</hi> the Duke was <hi>amazed,</hi> and much aſtoniſhed, but took <hi>no</hi> Warning or Notice thereof, keeping the <hi>ſame Company</hi> ſtill, adviſing with <hi>ſuch Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,</hi> and performing <hi>ſuch Actions</hi> as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Parker</hi> countermanded; ſhortly after, old Sir <hi>George Villiers</hi> in a very quiet but ſorrowful Poſture, appears again to <hi>Parker,</hi> and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> I know you deliver'd my Words to <hi>George</hi> my Son, I thank you for ſo doing, but he ſlighted them, and now I only requeſt this more at your Hands, that once again you repair to my Son, and tell him, that, if he will not amend, and follow the Counſel I have given him, this Knife or Dagger (and with that he pull'd a Knife or Dagger from under his Gown) ſhall end him; and do you Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> ſet your Houſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for you ſhall die at ſuch a Time. Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> once more engag'd, though very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, to acquaint the Duke with the laſt Meſſage, and ſo did; but the Duke deſir'd him to trouble him no further with ſuch Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and Dreams, and told him he perceiv'd he was now an old Man and doted; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a <hi>Month after</hi> meeting Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> on <hi>Lambeth</hi> Bridge; ſaid, now, Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> what
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0180400100:121"/>
ſay you of your Dream? Who only return'd; Sir, I <hi>wiſh</hi> it may <hi>never</hi> have <hi>ſucceſs, &amp;c.</hi> But within <hi>Six Weeks</hi> after, he was ſtab'd with a <hi>Knife,</hi> according to his <hi>Father's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> before-hand, and Mr. <hi>Parker died ſoon after</hi> he had ſeen the Dream or Viſion perform'd.</p>
               <p>This Relation is inſerted alſo in the <hi>Great</hi> Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Hiſtory, and in Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi>'s Chronicle. The Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> in his Hiſtory Vol. 1. <hi>L.</hi> 1. having given ſome Relations, ſays, that amongſt others, there was one (meaning this of <hi>Parker</hi>) which was upon a <hi>better Foundation of Credit,</hi> than <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually</hi> ſuch Diſcourſes are founded upon. And he tells us that <hi>Parker</hi> was an Officer in the King's Wardrobe in <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, of a good Reputation for Honeſty and Diſcretion, and then about the Age of Fifty Years or more. This Man had in his Youth been bred in a School in the Pariſh where Sir <hi>George Villiers,</hi> the Father of the Duke lived, and had been much cheriſh'd and obliged in that Seaſon of his Age, by the ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi> whom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he never ſaw. About Six Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the miſerable End of the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> the Apparition was ſeen; after the Third Appearance he made a Journey to <hi>London,</hi> where the Court then was; he was very well known to Sir <hi>Ralph Freeman,</hi> one of the Maſters of the Requeſts, who had married a Lady that was near allied to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0180400100:122"/>
Duke, and was himſelf well receiv'd by him. He inform'd the Duke with the Reputation and Honeſty of the Man, and Sir <hi>Ralph Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> carry'd the Man the next Morning, by Five of the Clock, to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> according to the Duke's Appointment, and there preſented him to the Duke, who receiv'd him courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly at his landing, and walk'd in Conference near an Hour with him, and Sir <hi>Ralph</hi>'s and the Duke's Servants at ſuch a diſtance, that they heard not a Word; but Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fix'd his <hi>Eyes</hi> on the Duke, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpoke with great <hi>Commotion</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;</hi> and that the Man told Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> in their return over the Water, that when he <hi>mentioned</hi> thoſe <hi>particulars</hi> that were to gain him <hi>Credit,</hi> the Duke's <hi>Colour changed,</hi> and he ſwore he could come to that Knowledge only by the <hi>Devil;</hi> for that thoſe particulars were known only to himſelf, and to one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more, who, he was ſure, would never ſpeak of them. So far the Lord <hi>Clarendon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will now ſubjoin an authentick Relation, which Mr. <hi>Beaumont</hi> tells us at the end of his Book of <hi>Genii</hi> or familiar Spirits, printed in the Year 1705. he had juſt before receiv'd from the Mouth of the then Biſhop of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> himſelf. It is as follows, Word for Word.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles Lee,</hi> by his firſt Lady, had only one Daughter, of which ſhe died in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; and when ſhe died, her Siſter, the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0180400100:123"/>
Lady <hi>Everard</hi> deſir'd to have the Education of the Child; and ſhe was by her very well educated, till ſhe was Marriageable; and a Match was concluded for her with Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Perkins,</hi> but was then prevented in an extraordinary manner. Upon a Thurſday Night ſhe thinking ſhe ſaw a Light in her Chamber after ſhe was in Bed, knock'd for her Maid, who preſently came to her; and ſhe ask'd why ſhe left a Candle burning in her Chamber? The Maid ſaid ſhe left none, and there was none, but what ſhe brought with her at that Time. Then ſhe ſaid it was the Fire: But that the Maid told her was quite out, and ſaid ſhe believ'd it was only a Dream; whereupon ſhe ſaid it might be ſo, and compos'd herſelf again to Sleep, but about Two of the Clock ſhe was awaken'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſaw the Apparition of a little Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man between her Curtain and her Pillow; who told her ſhe was her Mother, and that ſhe was Happy, and that by Twelve of the Clock that Day, ſhe ſhould be with her; whereupon, ſhe knock'd again for her Maid, called for her Cloaths, and when ſhe was dreſs'd, went into her Cloſet, and came not out again till Nine; and then brought out with her a Letter ſealed to her Father, brought it to her Aunt, the Lady <hi>Everard,</hi> told her what had happen'd, and deſir'd, that, aſſoon as ſhe was Dead, it might be ſent to him; but the Lady thought ſhe was ſuddenly fallen
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0180400100:124"/>
Mad; and thereupon ſent preſently away to <hi>Chelmsford</hi> for a Phyſician and Surgeon, who both came immediately, but the Phyſician could diſcern no Indication of what the Lady immagined, or of any Indiſpoſition of her Body; notwithſtanding the Lady would needs have her let Blood, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; and when the young Woman had patiently let them do what they would with her, ſhe deſir'd that the Chaplain might be called to read Prayers, and when Prayers were ended ſhe took her <hi>Gittar</hi> and <hi>Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book,</hi> and ſat down upon a Chair without Arms, and play'd and ſung ſo melodiouſly and admirably, that her Muſick-maſter, who was then there, admired at it; and near the Stroke of Twelve, ſhe roſe and ſat herſelf down in a great Chair with Arms, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fetching a ſtrong Breathing or Two, immediately expired, and was ſo ſuddenly Cold, as was much wonder'd at by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and Surgeon. She died at <hi>Waltham</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Three Miles from <hi>Chelmsford;</hi> and the Letter was ſent to Sir <hi>Charles</hi> at his Houſe in <hi>Warwickſhire:</hi> But he was ſo afflicted with the death of his Daughter, that he came not till ſhe was buried; but when he came he caus'd her to be taken up, and to be buried by her Mother at <hi>Edmunton,</hi> as ſhe deſir'd in her Letter. This was about the Year one Thouſand Six Hundred and Sixty Two, or Sixty Three. And this Relation the Right
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0180400100:125"/>
Reverend the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> had from Sir <hi>Charles Lee</hi> himſelf; and Mr. <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> printed it in his Book above-mentioned, from the Biſhops own Mouth.</p>
               <p>The Relations which I have given above, are not like the trifling Accounts too often given of theſe things, and therefore cauſing grave ones to be ridiculed in common with them. They are of that Nature, that, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever attempts to ridicule them, will, inſtead of turning them into Jeſt, become the Object of Ridicule himſelf.</p>
               <p>The firſt Story, which has in it ſuch amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Circumſtances, and ſuch uncommon and dreadful Incidents concerning the Butler in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is (as the Reader ſees) atteſted by no leſs a Perſonage than an Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi> Two Biſhops, and many other Noblemen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, being preſent and Eye-witneſſes of what the Earl ſaid. What greater Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would the moſt Incredulous have? They ſay ſuch things are told for Intereſt; what Intereſt could an Earl and <hi>many</hi> Noblemen have in promoting ſuch an Impoſture? The Incredulous ſay, likewiſe great and learned Men delight ſometimes in putting Frauds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World, and after laugh at their Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Would a Number of <hi>noble</hi> Lay-men chuſe <hi>Two Prelates</hi> to carry on ſuch a <hi>Fraud;</hi> and would Two <hi>pious Biſhops</hi> probably Combine with <hi>ſeveral,</hi> and <hi>ſome Servants</hi> there preſent, in ſpreading ſuch a <hi>Deceit?</hi> 'Tis paſt believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0180400100:126"/>
and it demands the ſtricteſt of moral Faith that can be given, to the moſt unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd Hiſtory, that the Pen of Man ever wrote.</p>
               <p>The Second Story is founded, firſt, upon the Experience of one of the moſt ingenious Men of that Age, Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> and then upon the Proof made by his Friend, Sir <hi>Robert Drury,</hi> who could at firſt ſcarce believe it; and ſhall we doubt the Credit of Men, whoſe Company (for their Credit be it ſpoken) a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ambaſſador was proud of gaining?</p>
               <p>The Third Story is told by <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf, who began the great Work of the Reformation.</p>
               <p>The Fourth is told by one that was a King's publick Miniſter, and told from his own Trial of the matter where he could have no Intereſt in the telling it.</p>
               <p>The Fifth is related by thoſe great Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, the Lord <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> as a Truth rely'd upon by themſelves, and fit to be credited by their Readers.</p>
               <p>The Sixth and laſt was related to Mr. <hi>Beaumont,</hi> by the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who receiv'd the Account from Sir <hi>Charles Lee</hi> himſelf, to whoſe Grand-daughter the Matter happen'd.</p>
               <p>Men who will not believe ſuch things, as theſe, ſo well atteſted to us, and given us by ſuch Authorities, becauſe they did not ſee them themſelves, nor any thing of the like Nature, ought not only to deny the <hi>Demon</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0180400100:127"/>
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> but that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf; they ſhould not diſpute the <hi>Genii</hi> of <hi>Caeſar, Cicero, Brutus, Mark Anthony,</hi> but avow that there were never any ſuch Men exiſting upon Earth, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all credible Hiſtory whatſoever. Mean while all Men, but thoſe, who run ſuch Lengths in their fantaſtical Incredulity, will, from the Facts above-mentioned, reſt ſatisfied, that there are ſuch things as evil and good <hi>Genit,</hi> and that Men have ſometimes a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them by all their Senſes, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly thoſe of <hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> and will not therefore be ſtartled at the ſtrange Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hiſtories, which I am going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of our young <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> and look upon ſome wonderful Adventures which he perform'd by the Intervention of his familiar <hi>Demon</hi> or <hi>Genius,</hi> as Falſhoods, only becauſe they are uncommon and ſurprizing, more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſince they were not done in a corner, but by an open way of Profeſſion of a predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of Things, in the Face of the Metropolis of <hi>London,</hi> where he ſettled Young, as will appear in the Progreſs of his Life. However, ſome People, notwithſtanding all this, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that though a Man may have a <hi>Genius</hi> appear to him, ſo as to convey into his Mind, through his Senſes, the knowledge of things that are to come to paſs, yet this happens, but on very eminent and extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Murder for Example of a prime
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0180400100:128"/>
Miniſter, and the Favourite of a Monarch, in ſuch a manner as it was perform'd on the Great <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by <hi>Felton,</hi> was a thing ſo uncommon, that it might perhaps deſerve, by the Permiſſion of Heaven, an uncommon Prediction: The others likewiſe are Inſtances Eminent in their way, particularly that of the Lady <hi>Everard</hi>'s Niece; For that young Lady being then Marriageable, and a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for that end being on Foot with Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Perkins;</hi> the Divine Providence fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that ſuch a State might call away her Thoughts, hitherto bent on him and ſpiritual Affairs, and fix them on the Trifles of this World, might perhaps permit her to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a holy Mother to the State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſhe before her enjoy'd, leaſt her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Mind ſhould change, and ſhe go into the Ways of a Sinner. But if theſe Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent, theſe ſcarce and rare Examples, may be admitted of Man's holding a Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſpiritualiz'd Beings of another World; it will however be far below the Dignity of humane Reaſon methinks, to make ſuch large Conceſſions to People, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Converſe that wonderful way, as to allow them the Credit of being able to do it upon every ſlight Occaſion, and every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Occurrence of human Life.</p>
               <p>I cannot help acknowledging, that a Man of Wiſdom may, at firſt Thought, make ſuch an Objection; but Reflection will preſently
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0180400100:129"/>
retract it, and the ſame good Senſe that taught him to make an Objection ſo well upon the firſt Thought, will teach him, upon Second Thoughts, to acquieſce in the Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Infants may have no doubt the Benefit of ſuch an attending <hi>Genius,</hi> as well as People more advanc'd in Years; as may be ſeen in one of the Inſtances, which is a very famous one, relating to the Boy Born in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> who was attended by one conſtantly from the Time of his Birth to his Death. Beſides it is a miſtake in the Underſtanding, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin, that Death, which is the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and end of Life, is of more Conſequence to be known than the manner of regulating that Life; for in reality, according to the right way of conſidering, Death, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of a Man's Life, derives its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance from the Steps which he took in the due regulation of it; and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very the leaſt Step, proper to be taken for the due regulation of Life, is of more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to be known, than the Death of a Perſon, though this at firſt ſight carries the Face of Significance, and the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than the look of a Trifle. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for example is a Step in Life of the utmoſt Importance, whether we conſider that Eſtate with regard to this, or the next World. Death is but the finiſhing of one Perſon, but Marriage may be the introducing of many into the World with Happineſs; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0180400100:130"/>
a thing of more importance to be known before-hand, and conſequently more worthy of the communication of a <hi>Genius</hi> to the Man with whom he convers'd. <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> tells us, that a certain <hi>Rhodian</hi> dying, nominated Six of his equals, and ſaid who ſhould die firſt, who next, and ſo on, and the event an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Prediction; why then (tho' ſome People are apt to make a Jeſt of it) may not a Man by the intervention of his good <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> tell a Woman, that is to have Six Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, who ſhe ſhall have firſt, who next, and ſo on, and the event anſwer the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? If Men of Learning may acquire ſuch Knowledge, as to attain to extraordinary Things by their ordinary Faculties, why may not ordinary Things be taught others in this extraordinary way? For will any-body ſay that it is eaſier for a Man to accommodate himſelf to the knowledge of a <hi>Demon</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> than for a <hi>Demon</hi> or <hi>Genius</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf to the Knowledge of a Man? Certain it is indeed that if this good <hi>Genius</hi> (that induces a Man with a prophetick kind of Science) be any thing reſembling a good Angel, the <hi>primary end</hi> of his being permitted to direct Mankind, muſt conſiſt in Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating more to their Welfare hereafter; yet I know not why they may not ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, or openly direct them in human Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in things relating to human Life, ſo they are of a good Tendency; more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0180400100:131"/>
ſince ſuch a good Inſpiration may be a counterballance to the bad Knowledge which ſome have been inſpir'd with by evil Spirits. I would not be thought to go too far in a Point of this Nature, and have therefore (though perhaps I could ſay much more if I follow'd entirely my own private Opinion, and would venture to introduce it here, in Order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to others, and make it a publick one) ſaid no more on this Head than what Divines generally teach.</p>
               <p>But the moſt unxeceptionable Miſtreſs, that teaches theſe Things to be in Nature, is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. If we had very many People gifted this way, the extraordinary Thing would have been become ordinary, and therefore I can't help wondering that it ſhould be ſo ordinary a Thing for wiſe Men themſelves to wonder too much at Things, becauſe they are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and ſuſpect them as Frauds, becauſe they are uncommon.</p>
               <p>There has ſcarce been any period of Time in which ſome Perſon of this prophetick Claſs has not exiſted, and has not been conſulted by the greateſt of Men, and their Predictions found at the long run to come true; ignorant Men always riſe to their Belief of them by Experience, and the moſt learned Men ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their great Opinions to Experience, but your Men of <hi>midling Talents,</hi> who make up their want of Reaſon with buſtling Obſtinacy and noiſy Contradiction, have been and ſtill
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0180400100:132"/>
continue to be their own Oppoſers, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering the reaſon for what they ſay, they content themſelves with having the laugh on their ſides, and barely affirming without proving, that it is a kind of <hi>ideal Juggle</hi> and <hi>intellectual Legerdemain,</hi> by which theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Predictors impoſe things upon the Eye of Reaſon, as the corporeal Eye is impos'd upon by ſlight of Hand; but it is a ſtrange thing that Men of ſuch quick Reaſon can't give us a Sample of the Frauds. Thus I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have read (I can't tell where) a Story of ſome Courtiers, who, when a great Artiſt of <hi>Legerdemain</hi> was to act before the King, pretended to be ſo quick ſighted, that nothing he did ſhould eſcape their Diſcovery, were left by his nimble Fingers in the Dark, and forc'd at laſt with Bluſhes to own they had no better Eyes than other People. In a Word, if People will be led by Suſpicions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote poſſibilities of Fraud and Contrivance of ſuch Men, all Hiſtorical Truth ſhall be ended, when it conſiſts not with a Man's private Humour or Prejudice to admit it. Now therefore to prove by Experience and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Teſtimonies, that theſe kind of <hi>Genii</hi> will ſubmit to little Offices in order to bring Men to greater Good; I will give the Reader Three or Four curious Paſſages, that will ſet the reaſonable Reader at eaſe, and prepare him for reading the Paſſages of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Life with Pleaſure, and as a fine Hiſtory of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0180400100:133"/>
Facts, that though they ſeem to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs Belief, yet ought to have his Credit.</p>
               <p>What in Nature can be more trivial than for a Spirit to employ himſelf in knocking on a Morning at the Wainſcot by the Beds-head of a Man who got drunk over Night, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the way that ſuch things are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily explain'd? And yet I ſhall give you ſuch a Relation of this, that not even the moſt devout and preciſe <hi>Presbyterian</hi> will offer to call in Queſtion. For Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Diſcourſe of Apparitions writes thus.</p>
               <p>There is now in <hi>London</hi> an underſtanding ſober pious Man, oft one of my Hearers, who has an elder Brother, a Gentleman of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Rank, who having formerly ſeem'd Pious, of late Years does often fall into the Sin of Drunkenneſs; he often Lodges long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether here in his Brother's Houſe; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is Drunk and has ſlept himſelf So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſomething knocks at his Bed's-head, as if one knock'd on a Wainſcot: When they remove his Bed it follows him: Beſides other loud Noiſes, on other Parts where he is, that all the Houſe hears, they have often watch'd him, and kept his Hands leaſt he ſhould do it himſelf: His Brother has often told it me, and brought his Wife a diſcreet Woman to atteſt it; who avers moreover, that as ſhe watch'd him, ſhe has ſeen his Shoes under the Bed taken up, and nothing Viſible to touch them. They brought the Man himſelf
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0180400100:134"/>
to me, and when we ask'd him, how he dare Sin again after ſuch a warning, he had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: But being Perſons of Quality, for ſome ſpecial Reaſon of worldly Intereſt I muſt not name him.</p>
               <p>Two things are remarkable in this Inſtance. (ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>firſt,</hi> What a powerful thing Temptation and fleſhly Concupiſcence is, and what an harden'd Heart Sin brings Men to; if one roſe from the Dead to warn ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it would not of itſelf perſwade them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) It Poſes me to think what kind of <hi>Spirit</hi> this is, that has ſuch a care of this Man's Soul, which makes me hope he will Recover. Do good <hi>Spirits</hi> dwell ſo near us, or are they ſent on ſuch Meſſages? Or is it his Guardian Angel? Or is it the Soul of ſome dead Friend that Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers? and yet retaining Love to him as <hi>Dives</hi> to his Brethren would have him ſaved? God yet keeps ſuch things from us in the Dark.</p>
               <p>So far we have the Authority of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd and famous Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who makes this knocking of the <hi>Spirit</hi> at the Bed's-head (though what we commonly call frivolous) an important Errand.</p>
               <p>Another Relation of this kind was ſent to Mr. <hi>John Beaumont</hi> (whom I myſelf perſonally know and which he has inſerted in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Genit</hi> or <hi>familiar Spirits</hi>) in a Letter by an ingenious and learned Clergy-man of <hi>Wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſhire</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had given him the Relation
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0180400100:135"/>
likewiſe before by Word of Mouth. It is as follows.</p>
               <p>Near Eighty Years ſince, in the Pariſh of <hi>Wilcot</hi> (which is by the Devizes) in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car's Houſe, there was heard for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Time the ſound of a Bell, conſtantly tolling every Night; the occaſion was this: A debauch'd Perſon who liv'd in the Pariſh, came one Night very late and demanded the Keys of the Church, of the Vicar, that he might ring a Peal, which the Vicar refus'd to let him have, alledging the unſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Time, and that he ſhould by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Deſires give a diſturbance to Sir <hi>George Wroughton</hi> and his Family, whoſe Houſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to the Church-yard. Upon this refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal the Fellow went away in a Rage, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be reveng'd of the Vicar, and going ſome time after to the Devizes, met with one <hi>Cantle</hi> or <hi>Cantlow,</hi> a Perſon <hi>noted</hi> in thoſe Days for a <hi>Wizard;</hi> and he tells him how the Vicar had ſerv'd him, and begs his help to be even with him. The Reply <hi>Cantel</hi> made him was this; does he not love ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? He ſhall have enough of it: And from that Time a Bell began to Toll in his Houſe, and continued ſo to do till <hi>Cantell</hi>'s Death, who confeſs'd at <hi>Fiſherton</hi> Goal in <hi>Sarum,</hi> (where he was confin'd by King <hi>James</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Life) that he caus'd that Sound, and that it ſhould be heard in that Place during Life. The Thing was ſo notorious, that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0180400100:136"/>
Perſons came from all Parts to hear it. And King <hi>James</hi> ſent a Gentleman from <hi>London,</hi> on purpoſe to give him Satisfaction concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of the Report. Mr. <hi>Beaumont</hi> had likewiſe this Story as he tells from the Mouth of Sir <hi>George Wroughton</hi>'s own Son; with this remarkable Circumſtance, that if any in the Houſe put their Heads out of the Window, they could not hear the Sound, but heard it immediately again as ſoon as they ſtood in the Room.</p>
               <p>The Reader here ſees that good and bad <hi>Genit</hi> exerciſe themſelves upon very little Functions, knocking at Bed's-heads, and ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bells. For Proof of this we have the Teſtimonies of Two Divines, of a Man of Quality and Probity, and the ſame Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that a learned King had, who ſent to inquire into the matter; and after this there can be I think no room for Doubt.</p>
               <p>But to carry the Point ſtill nearer Home; Inaſmuch as I know ſome will leave no Stone unturn'd, to make the extraordinary Actions, which the Perſon, whoſe Life I write, has perform'd, appear Impoſtures, and inaſmuch as for this End they may ſay, that though many People may have been gifted in this extraordinary manner, yet not ſo as to make a Profeſſion of it, and therefore from thence they take their Suſpicions, I ſhall in this Place to remove every niceſt Scruple they can have touching this Affair, give the Reader one
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0180400100:137"/>
Inſtance of this kind likewiſe, before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with my Hiſtory,</p>
               <p>There lived not many Years ſince a very aged Gentlewoman, in <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>Water-lane,</hi> by <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Pight,</hi> who was endow'd with a prophetick <hi>Spirit:</hi> And the ingenious Mr. <hi>Beaumont</hi> (whom I perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally knew and who had a familiar <hi>Genius</hi> himſelf) gives the World this Account of her. She was very well known (ſays he) to many Perſons of my Acquaintance now living in <hi>London.</hi> Among others, a Gentleman, whoſe Candour I can no way ſuſpect, has told me, that he often reſorted to her, as to an Oracle; and that aſſoon as he came into her Preſence, ſhe would uſually tell him, that ſhe knew what he was coming for, for that ſhe had ſeen his <hi>Spirit</hi> for ſome Time before: And without his ſaying any thing to her, ſhe would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tell him what the Buſineſs was, which he came to conſult her about, and what the Event of it would be; which he always found to fall out as ſhe ſaid, and many other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons now living can teſtify the like Experience of her as to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give the Publick one further little Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the like kind with the foregoing ones, with this only difference, that if it be valued according to the worth the World has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attributed to the very ingenious Perſon whom it concerns, it will be far the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0180400100:138"/>
of them all, and therefore fitteſt to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this Chapter, and to crown this part of the Work, in which we are ſhowing that Perſons have had a Perception of <hi>Genii</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> not viſible at the ſame time to others.</p>
               <p>The famous <hi>Torquatus Taſſo</hi> Prince of the <hi>Italian</hi> Poets, and ſcarce inferior to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf, and who ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the intermingled Guifts of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate <hi>Judgment</hi> of this <hi>Latin</hi> Poet, and the more <hi>fertile</hi> and <hi>copious invention</hi> and <hi>fancy</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> one, <hi>Homer,</hi> ſtrongly aſſerted his own Experience in this kind. His Life was written and publiſhed in <hi>French, Anno</hi> 1692. by <hi>D. C. D. D. V.</hi> who, in his Preface, tells us, that, in what he writ, he has follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly the Hiſtory given us in <hi>Italian</hi> by <hi>John Baptiſta Manſo,</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Gentleman, who had been a very <hi>intimate</hi> Friend to <hi>Taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> In his Life, among other things, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us, that <hi>Taſſo</hi> was naturally of that melancholick Temperament, which has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made the greateſt Men, and that this Temperament being aggravated by many Hardſhips he had undergone, it made him ſometimes <hi>beſide himſelf,</hi> and that thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Vapors being diſpatched, he came again to himſelf, like thoſe, that return from Fits of the falling Sickneſs, his <hi>Spirit</hi> being as free as before. That, near his latter End, he retired from the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> to his Friend <hi>Manſo,</hi> at <hi>Biſaccia,</hi> a ſmall Town in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0180400100:139"/>
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> where <hi>Manſo</hi> had a conſiderable Eſtate, and paſſed an <hi>Autumn</hi> there in the Diverſions of the Seaſon.</p>
               <p>And here the <hi>French</hi> Author gives us an Account of <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s ſenſible Perception of a <hi>Genius</hi> as follows. As, after theſe Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he uſually retired to his Chamber, to entertain himſelf there with his Friend <hi>Manſo,</hi> the latter had the opportunity to inquire into one of the moſt ſingular Effects of <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s Melancholy, (of this <hi>heroick Melancholy,</hi> as I may call it) which raiſed and brightened his <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſo far it was from depreſſing or rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it obſcure; and which, among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, would have reaſonably caus'd them, to have aſcribed a <hi>familiar Demon</hi> to him, as to <hi>Socrates.</hi> They were often in a warm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, concerning this <hi>Spirit,</hi> with which <hi>Taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> pretended to have ſo free a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I'm too much your Friend, ſaid <hi>Manſo,</hi> to him, one Day, not to let you know, what the World thinks of you, concerning this thing, and what I think of it myſelf. Is it poſſible, that, being inlightened as you are, you ſhould be fall'n into ſo great a Weakneſs, as to think you have a <hi>familiar Spirit;</hi> and will you give your Enemies that advantage, to be able to prove by your own acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what they have already publiſhed to the World? You know they ſay, you did not publiſh your <hi>Dialogue of the Meſſenger,</hi> as a <hi>fiction;</hi> but you would have Men believe,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0180400100:140"/>
that the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which you make to ſpeak there, was a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>true Spirit:</hi> Hence Men have drawn this injurious Conſequence, that your Studies have <hi>embroil'd</hi> your Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that there is made in it a <hi>confuſed mixture</hi> of the Fictions of the <hi>Poets,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and the Doctrine of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, anſwer'd <hi>Taſſo,</hi> of all that is ſpread abroad in the World, on the account of my <hi>Dialogue:</hi> I have taken care divers Times to diſ-abuſe my Friends, both by Letter and Word of Mouth: I prevented ev'n the Malignity of my Enemies, as you know, at the Time I publiſh'd my <hi>Dialogue.</hi> Men could not be ignorant that I compos'd it for the young Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to whom I would explain, after an agreeable manner, the principal Myſteries of the Platonick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. It was at <hi>Mantua</hi> itſelf, after my Second Flight from <hi>Ferrara,</hi> that I form'd the <hi>Idea</hi> of it, and I committed it to Paper a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after my unfortunate Return. I addreſs'd it to this Prince, and all Men might have read in the <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> the Proteſtation I there make, that this <hi>Dialogue</hi> being writ according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> which is not always conformable to reveal'd Truths; Men muſt not confound what I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there as a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> with what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> This diſtinction is by ſo much the more reaſonable, that at that Time
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0180400100:141"/>
nothing extraordinary had happened to me, and I ſpake not of any <hi>Apparition.</hi> This can be atteſted by all thoſe with whom I lodged or whom frequented in this Voyage; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no reaſon for confounding the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my <hi>Dialogue,</hi> with what has happen'd to me ſince. I am perſwaded of all you ſay to me, reply'd <hi>Manſo,</hi> but truly I cannot be of what you believe, at preſent, concerning your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Will you imagin, that you are in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with a <hi>Spirit?</hi> And I ask you of what Order is that <hi>Spirit?</hi> Shall we place him in the number of the Rebels, whom their Pride precipitated into the <hi>Abyſs?</hi> Or of the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, who continued firm in Faith and Submiſſion to their Creator? For there is no mean to take in the true Religion, and we muſt not fall into the extravagances of the <hi>Gnomes</hi> and <hi>Silphs</hi> of the <hi>Cabaliſts.</hi>

               <p>Now the <hi>Spirit</hi> in Queſtion cannot be a <hi>Demon:</hi> You own that inſtead of inſpiring you any thing contrary to Piety and Religion, he often fortifies in you the Maxims of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; he ſtrengthens your Faith by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reaſonings, and has the ſame Reſpect with you for ſacred Names and Things, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can you ſay that it's an <hi>Angel;</hi> for, tho' you have always led a regular Life, and far from all Diſſoluteneſs; tho' for ſome Years paſt you have apply'd yourſelf, after a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, to the Duties of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, you will agree with me, that theſe ſorts
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0180400100:142"/>
of Favors are not common; that a Man muſt have attained to a high degree of Sanctity, and not be far from the pureneſs of Celeſtial <hi>Spirits,</hi> to merit a familiar Converſe, and bear a Harmony with them. Believe me there is nothing in all theſe Diſcourſes, which you imagin you have with this <hi>Spirit.</hi> You know, better than any Man, thoſe Symptoms, which the black Humours, wherewith you are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, cauſes in you. Your Vapours are the ſource of your Viſions, and yourſelf would not iudge otherwiſe of another Perſon, to whom a like thing ſhould happen; and you will come to this in your own reſpect alſo, if you will make a mature Reflection, and apply yourſelf, to blot out, by an effort of Reaſon, theſe Immaginations, which the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of your evil Effect cauſes in you. You may have Reaſon, reply'd <hi>Taſſo,</hi> to think ſo of the things that paſs in me; but, as to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who have a ſenſible Perception of them, I am forced to reaſon after another manner. If it were true that the <hi>Spirit</hi> did not ſhew himſelf to me, but in the violent aſſault of my Vapours: If he offer'd to my Immagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but wandring and confus'd <hi>Species,</hi> without Connection or due Sequel; if he us'd to me frivolous reaſonings, which ended in nothing; or it having begun ſome ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, he broke it off on a ſudden, and left me in Darkneſs, I ſhould believe with you, that all things, that paſs, are but mere Dreams
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0180400100:143"/>
and Phantoms: But it's quite otherwiſe: This <hi>Spirit</hi> is a <hi>Spirit</hi> of Truth and Reaſon, and of a Truth ſo diſtinct, of a Reaſon ſo ſublime, that he raiſes me often to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that are above all my reaſonings, tho' they appear to me no leſs clear; that he teaches me things, which, in my moſt profound Meditations, never came into my Spirit, and which I never heard of any Man, nor read in any Book. This <hi>Spirit</hi> therefore is ſomewhat of <hi>real;</hi> of whatſoever Order he be, I hear him and ſee him, nevertheleſs for its being impoſſible for me to comprehend and define him. <hi>Manſo</hi> did not yield to theſe Facts, which <hi>Taſſo</hi> would have paſs'd for Proofs: He preſs'd him with new <hi>Queſtions,</hi> which were not without <hi>Anſwers.</hi> Since you will not believe me on my Word, ſaid <hi>Taſſo</hi> to him, another Day, after having well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, I muſt convince you by your own Eyes, that theſe things are not pure Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: And the next Day converſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame Chamber, <hi>Manſo</hi> perceiv'd that, on a ſudden he fix'd his Eyes towards the Window, and that he ſtood, as it were, immovable; he call'd to him and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Manſo</hi> ſomewhat ſurprized, caſt his Eyes towards the Place he ſhewed him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd nothing but the Rays of the Sun paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Glaſs, nor did he ſee any thing in all the Chamber, though he caſt his Eyes round it with Curioſity, and he deſir'd him to ſhew him the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which he look'd for in vain, while he heard <hi>Taſſo</hi> ſpeak with much Vehemency. He declares in a Letter, which he writ concerning this to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Naples,</hi> that he really heard no other Voice, but <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s own: But they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Queſtions</hi> made by him to the pretended <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Anſwers,</hi> that he made to the pretended <hi>Queſtions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and which were couch'd in ſuch admirable Terms, ſo efficacious, concerning Subjects ſo elevated, and ſo extraordinary, that he was raviſhed with Admiration, and dared not to interrupt him.

On the contrary, anſwer'd <hi>Manſe,</hi> I am more imbroiled than ever; I have truly heard wonderful things; but you have not ſhewed me, what you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me; you have ſeen and heard, reſumed <hi>Taſſo</hi> perhaps more than—he ſtop'd here; and <hi>Manſo,</hi> who could not recover

himſelf of his ſurprize, and had his Head fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the <hi>Ideas</hi> of this extraordinary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, found himſelf not in a condition to preſs him farther.

They had many other Converſations concerning this matter, after which <hi>Manſo</hi> own'd he was brought to that paſs, that he knew not what to think or ſay, only, that, if it were a Weakneſs in his Friend to believe theſe Viſions, he much fear'd it would prove contagious to him, and that he ſhould become at laſt as credulous as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

               <p>Torquatus Taſſo <hi>died about the Forty Fifth Year of his Age, a Man of a wonderful and prodigious Wit, who was ſeized with an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fury in his Youth, when he lived at the</hi>

He that knows not theſe things, which all Men know, that have been in</hi> Italy, <hi>and concerning which, himſelf ſometimes complains, though modeſtly, in his Writings; let him read his</hi> Divine <hi>Works, and he muſt neceſſarily conclude, either, that I</hi> ſpeak <hi>of</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man <hi>than</hi> Taſſo, <hi>or that theſe things were</hi> Written <hi>by</hi> another Man <hi>than</hi> Taſſo.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. A Narrative of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s coming to <hi>London</hi> and taking upon him the Profeſſion of a Predictor; together with an Account of many ſtrange things that came to paſs juſt as he foretold.</head>
            <p>TO proceed on regularly with the Life of young <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> I muſt let the Reader know that he continued thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with his little <hi>Genius,</hi> as is ſet forth above in the Dialogue he had with me, and predicting many things of the like Nature, as I have deſcribed, till the Year 1694. when he was juſt Fourteen Years of Age, and then he left <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I come to ſpeak of the manner of his departure from thence, his half native Country, inaſmuch as his Father was of that Country, and he had his Education there. (what Education he could have being Deaf and Dumb) I muſt let the Reader know that in the Year 1692. my very good Friend Mrs. <hi>Campbell,</hi> his Mother in Law, died, and left
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0180400100:151"/>
him there at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> an Orphan of Twelve Years of Age.</p>
            <p>He was, I may venture to ſay, the moſt beautiful Boy of that Age I ever knew; and the ſenſible Reader, who conſiders a Child of good Birth, with the Misfortunes of being Deaf and Dumb, left Fatherleſs and Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the wide World, at Twelve Years Old, without any Competency for his Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Support, without any Relations, in a manner, that knew him or aſſiſted him, all the little Fortune, his Father had, having been loſt in the civil Commotions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I have related above, need not hear me deſcribe the Compaſſion, I, and many more, had for him; becauſe ſuch a Reader muſt certainly feel in his own Boſom the ſame live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Acts of Pity and Commiſeration, at the hearing of ſuch a Miſhap, as I had at the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or at leaſt as I have now reviv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh within me at the relating it.</p>
            <p>However, it came ſo to paſs, that a Perſon of the Name of <hi>Campbell,</hi> and who was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Relation of the Boy, though he himſelf was but in indifferent Circumſtances, was reſolv'd to ſee him provided for one way or another, in a manner ſomewhat ſuitable to his Condition, and till that Time to take the beſt care of him himſelf, that he was able.</p>
            <p>Several Ladies of Quality, who had known his Perfections, coveted to make the Boy one of their Domeſticks, as a Page, or a Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0180400100:152"/>
to their Children; for though he could not ſpeak, he had ſuch a Vivacity in all his Actions, ſuch a ſprightlineſs of Behaviour, and ſuch a Merriment accompanying all his Geſtures, that he afforded more Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the prettieſt and wittieſt little Pratlers at thoſe Years are wont to do. Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> had certainly accepted of ſome of theſe fortunate Offers for his little Couſin, which were many of them likely to prove very Advantageous, if it had not been put in his Head by ſome Friends, particularly myſelf, that if he had a mind to diſpoſe of the Boy in that manner, the beſt way he could take, would be, to preſent him to the late Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who for his Name ſake, and for his Father's ſake, as well as the Qualifications and Endowments of the Boy, would more naturally (according to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability) take a greater pleaſure and delight in him, and conſequently provide better for him, and with a more laſting Care, than any other Perſon of Quality, that had a ſudden liking to him which might change, and took him as a Stranger out of a bare Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> was by theſe Reaſons over-rul'd in the diſpoſal of his little Dumb Prophetical Couſin, as he call'd him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd that an Offer ſhould be made of him to the preſent illuſtrious Duke of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s moſt noble Father. But it ſo unfortunately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that the Earl making very much a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0180400100:153"/>
longer ſtay at <hi>London,</hi> than was expected, Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> the Uncle, ſent our young <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Campbell,</hi> his Nephew, handſomely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couter'd, and with a handſome Summ of Money in his Pocket, by Sea, with Captain <hi>Meek</hi> of <hi>Kircaldie,</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> with Letters of Recommendation to the Earl's Favour, and juſt a few Days before young <hi>Duncan</hi> arrived in <hi>London,</hi> the Earl was ſet out on his Journey to his Seat in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had now left him for near Three Years, not having ſeen him, ſince about a Year after his Mother's Death; and then coming to <hi>London,</hi> I had by mere accident an Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to meet ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen at the <hi>Buffalo</hi> at <hi>Charing-croſs.</hi> There happen'd at that Time to be a great Concourſe of <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility there at an Entertainment, and one of the Ladies and Gentlemen paſſing by and ſeeing one of my Friends, deſir'd him to come in, and told him both he and his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be very welcome to partake of the Diverſion. The Lady told him they had got a lovely Youth, a <hi>Scotch</hi> Miracle among them, that would give us exquiſite Delight, and write down to us all the Occurrences of our future Lives, and tell us our Names upon our firſt Appearance. The Moment I heard of it, <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> came into my Head; but as it is a thing not rare to be met with in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for Second ſighted Perſons to tell ſuch things, and as the Earl of <hi>Angyle</hi> was
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0180400100:154"/>
in the North, I thought little <hi>Duncan</hi> had been under his Protection and with him, and did not dream of meeting with him there, and accordingly told my Friend, before I went in, that I believed I knew a Lad in <hi>Scotland</hi> would exceed this in Fore-ſight, let him be as dexterous in his Art as he would.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I enter'd the Room, I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to find myſelf encompaſs'd and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a Circle of the moſt beautiful Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males that ever my Eyes beheld. In the Centre of this Angelick Tribe was ſeated a heavenly Youth, with the moſt winning comelineſs of Aſpect, that ever pleaſed the Sight of any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of either Sex; his Face was divinely Fair, and ting'd only with ſuch a ſprightly Bluſh, as a Painter would uſe to Colour the Picture of Health with, and the Complexion was varniſh'd over by a blooming, like that of flouriſhing Fruit, which had not yet felt the firſt Nippings of an unkind and an uncivil Air; with this Beauty was join'd ſuch a ſmiling draught of all the Features, as is the reſult of Pleaſantry and good Humour. His Eyes were large, full of Luſtre, Majeſtick, well ſet, and the Soul ſhone ſo in them, as told the Spectators plainly, how great was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Vivacity of his <hi>Genius:</hi> The Hair of his Head was thick and reclin'd far below his Shoulders; it was of a fine Silver Colour, and hung down in Ringlets like the curling Tendrils of a copious Vine. He was by the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0180400100:155"/>
Women entertain'd, according to the Claim, which ſo many Perfections joining in a Youth juſt ripening into Manhood, might lay to the benevolent Diſpoſitions of the tender Sex. One was holding the Baſon of Water, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waſhing a Hand, a Third with a Towel drying his Face, which another Fair had gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſnatch'd the Pleaſure of waſhing before, while a Forth was diſpoſing into order his Silver Hairs with an Ivory Comb, in an Hand as White, and which a Monarch might have been proud to have had ſo employ'd in adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the Crown upon his Head; a Fifth was ſetting into Order his Crevat; a Sixth ſtole a Kiſs, and bluſh'd at the innocent Pleaſure, and miſtook her own Thoughts as if ſhe kiſs'd the Angel and not the Man; and they all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem'd to adore than to love him, as if they had taken him not for a Perſon that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the frequent Gift of the Second Sight, but as if he had been ſome little Prophet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly inſpired, and while they all thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and wonder'd they all conſulted him as an Oracle. The ſurprize of ſeeing a young Man ſo happy amidſt the general concurring Favours of the Fair, made me be for a while loſt in a kind of delightful Amazement, and the conſideration of what Bliſs he was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, made me ſcarce believe my own Eyes, when they told me it was <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> who I had left an unhappy Orphan at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> But ſo it was, though he was much
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0180400100:156"/>
altered in Stature being now ſhot up pretty faſt in his Growth ſince I had ſeen him, and having gain'd a kind of a fix'd Comportment, ſuch as we may daily obſerve in thoſe, who are taking leave of their Minority, and ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into a Stage of maturer Life.</p>
            <p>The firſt remarkable thing I knew him do in <hi>London,</hi> being in this ſplendid Company, where there were ſo many undoubted Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Quality too, that had ocular Proof of his Predictions at that publick Tavern: I chuſe to Record it here in the firſt Place, according to its due Order. It was in the Year 1698.</p>
            <p>Among this Angelical Claſs of Beauties, were Dr. <hi>W<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d</hi>'s Lady and Daughter. Upon Earth there was not ſure a more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Creature than the Daughter was; ſhe was the leading Light of all the ſparkling Tribe; and <hi>Otway</hi>'s Character ſuits her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly; for ſhe was <hi>among Ten Thouſand emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Fair.</hi> One would imagin proſperous and lucky Fortune was written upon her Face, and that nothing unhappy could be read in ſo fair a Book; and it was therefore the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conſent of all, that, by way of good Omen to the reſt, his Predictions ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be open'd luckily that Day, and that therefore he ſhould firſt of all be conſulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Mother to be ſatisfied of his Talent, before ſhe proceeded to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0180400100:157"/>
Queſtions, ask'd him in writing if he knew the young Lady, her Name, and who ſhe was. After a little ruminating and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon the matter, and taking an exact View of the Beauty, he wrote down her Name, told Mrs. <hi>W<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>lw<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> ſhe was her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that her Father was a Doctor. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by his ſo readily telling the Name and Quality of Perſons he had never ſeen in his Life-time, that Fame had not given a falſe Character of his Capacity, ſhe proceeded in her Queſtions as to her future Fortune. He gaz'd a freſh at her very eagerly for ſome time, and his Countenance during that time of viewing her ſeem'd to be rufled with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Diſturbance and Perplexity. We all imagin'd that the Youth was a little touch'd at the Heart himſelf with what he ſaw, and that inſtead of telling hers, he had met in her bright Eyes with his own Deſtiny, the Deſtiny of being for ever made a Slave and a Captive, to ſo many powerful and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt irreſiſtable Charms.</p>
            <p>At length, after having a long Debate within himſelf, which we thought proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſtruglings of Love and Paſſion, he fetching a great Sigh, which ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us more, took the Pen and wrote to Mrs. <hi>W<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>lw<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>d,</hi> that he beg'd to be excus'd, and that his Pen might remain as Dumb and Silent as his Tongue, on that Affair. By this Anſwer we concluded one and all,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0180400100:158"/>
that our former Conjectures were true, and we join'd in preſſing him the more earneſtly to deliver his real and ſincere Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Accidents upon which the future Fortunes of her Life were to turn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. He ſhew'd many mighty Reluctances in the doing it; and I have often ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him in the ſame Anguiſh as the late great Dr. <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> who was endeavouring by Study to ſave a certain fair One, whom he lov'd with a vehemence of Temper, and who was (as his Reaſon told him) got far away beyond the reach of the Art of Phyſick to recover. At laſt he wrote in plain Terms, that his backwardneſs and unwillingneſs to tell it, aroſe from his wiſhes that her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would be better than his certain Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of it told him it would be, and beg'd that we would reſt ſatisfied with that general Anſwer, ſince it was in ſo particular a Caſe, where he himſelf was a well-wiſher, in vain, to the Lady about whom he was conſulted. The young Lady herſelf thinking, that, if ſhe knew any Diſaſters, that were to befal her, ſhe might by knowing the nature of them beforehand, and the time when they were likely to happen, be able by timely Prudence and Forecaſt to avert thoſe Evils; with many beſeechings, urg'd him to reveal the fatal Secret. After many ſtruggles to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, and as many Inſtances made to him, both by Mother and Daughter, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0180400100:159"/>
of his Preſcience in that Point, he comply'd with very great difficulty, and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Paper with Tears that trickled faſt from his Eyes, he gave her the lamentable Scroll, containing the Words that follow, <hi>viz.</hi> I wiſh it had not fallen to my Lot to tell this Lady, whom every Body, that but once looks at her, muſt admire, though they muſt not have leave to love, that ſhe is not much longer to be poſſeſſor of that lovely Face, which gains her ſuch a number of Adorers. The ſmall Pox will too ſoon turn a Raviſher, and rifle all thoſe Sweets and Charms that might be able to vanquiſh a King, and to ſubdue a Conqueror of mighty Battles. Her Reign is doom'd alaſs to be as ſhort as it is now Great and Univerſal: I believe ſhe has interval Beauties of the Mind, not the leaſt inferior to thoſe external Excellencies of the Body, and ſhe might perhaps by the power of her Mind alone, be abſolute Queen of the Affections of Men, if the ſmall Pox threaten'd not too ſurely to be her further Enemy, and, not contented to deſtroy the Face, was not perverſely bent to deſtroy the whole Woman. But I want Words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my Sorrow.—I would not tell it, if you did not extort the baneful Secret from my Boſom.—This fair Creature, whoſe Beauty would make one wiſh her Immortal, will by the cruel means of the ſmall Pox, give us too ſudden a Proof of her Mortality.—But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0180400100:160"/>
the Mother nor herſelf ought too much too repine at this, ſeeing it appears to be the Decree of Providence, which is always to be interpreted, as meant for our Good, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may be the means of tranſlating her the ſooner only to her kindered Angels, whoſe Beauty ſhe ſo much reſembles here on Earth, and to be among the loweſt Claſs, of whom is better than being the greateſt Beauty of the World here below, and wearing an Imperial Crown.—While I comfort you, I can't help the force of Nature, which makes me grieve myſelf, and I only give you, becauſe you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel me to it, ſo particular and ſo exact an Anſwer, to ſo particular and ſo exacting a Queſtion.</p>
            <p>The Mother, who took the Paper, was prudent enough to conceal from the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what he ſaid, but Nature would force its way, and bubled from her Eyes; and the Daughter perceiving that, preſs'd hard to ſee it, and wept at the conſideration that hard Fate (though ſhe knew not particularly what way) was to befal her. Never ſurely was any thing ſo beautiful in Tears, and I obtain'd of the Mother to ſee the Writing.—At laſt, in general Terms, to free her from a ſuſpenſe of Mind, it was told her that ſome Trouble ſhould happen to her that would diminiſh her Beauty. She had Courage enough to hear that Misfortune with diſdain, and crying, if that be all, I am arm'd, I dont place much
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0180400100:161"/>
Pride in that, which I know Age muſt ſhortly after deſtroy, if Trouble did not do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and ſhe dry'd up her Tears, and (if what Mr. <hi>Bruyere</hi> ſays be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the laſt thing a celebrated Woman thinks of when ſhe dies, is the loſs of her Beauty) ſhe ſhew'd an admirable Pattern of female Philoſophy, in bearing ſuch a cruel Prediction with ſuch unſpeakable Magnanimity, as exceeded even the Patience of ſtern Stoiſm, conſidering ſhe was a Woman, to whom Beauty is more dear than Life.</p>
            <p>If any Evil, that is impending over Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Heads, could be evaded by Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or eluded by Art, ſhe had the faireſt opportunity of having this Prediction annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (which would have been more to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Predictor than knowing it verified) than ever any Woman had. Her Mother was ſpecifically told, that the fatal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper ſhould be the ſmall Pox; her Father was, and is ſtill, a very Eminent Phyſician; and Diſtempers of that kind, eſpecially, are much more eaſily prevented, by Care, than cur'd by Art, and by Art more eaſily ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, when there is a timely warning given to a Phyſician to prepare the Body againſt the danger of the Poiſon, than when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper has once catch'd hold of a Body at unawares, when it is unpurg'd of any groſs Humours that may accompany it. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fore-knowledge and Caution of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0180400100:162"/>
Mother, nor the Skill and Wiſdom of the great Phyſician her Father, were ſufficient to ward off the approaching Harm, that was written in the Books of Fate. Not many Suns had finiſhed their yearly Courſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was forc'd to ſubmit to the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Stroak of Death, after the infectious and malicious Malady had firſt ravag'd her Beauty, rioted in all her Sweets, and made an odious deform'd Spectacle of the Charmer of Mankind. The Death of the Daughter work'd hard upon the Mother's Bowels, and dragg'd her ſpeedily after her, with a broken Heart to the Grave.</p>
            <p>This Lady, whoſe Fortune ſo great and ſo diſtinguiſh'd an Aſſembly had choſen to hear as a happy Fore-runner and lucky Omen of all their own, which were to be ask'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in their turns, proving ſo contrary to their Expectations already unfortunate in the Prediction, and having been in Tears about the matter diſhearten'd all the reſt of the Beauties from conſulting him further that Day. The Perſon, who kept the Tavern, by Name Mrs. <hi>Irwin,</hi> alledg'd that as ſome People were very fortunate and others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate upon the ſame Day; ſo one Lady might be before told a miſhap one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, and another Lady all the Proſperity in Nature the very next Minute following, and therefore that what the unfortunate Lady had heard was not to be taken as Ominous, or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0180400100:163"/>
as what could Malignantly influence the Day, neither ought it to be the leaſt hinderance to any who had the curioſity of being let into the Secrets of Time before-hand. However, whether the Ladies were convinc'd or no; if ſhe prevail'd over their Belief in that Point, ſhe could not prevail over their Humour, which (though they might not believe the former Prediction ominous to themſelves) was naturally aw'd for fear of the like, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, for a Time, and ſo it was agreed, <hi>nemine Contradicente,</hi> as a witty Lady wrote it down, that no more Petitions ſhould for that Day be preſented by any of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to his Dumb, yet oracular, Majeſty. Mrs. <hi>Irwin,</hi> however, would have her way; ſaid ſhe did not preſume to ſuch Honour as to call herſelf of that Company, and that therefore ſhe might conſult him without breaking through the Votes of the Aſſembly. Many endeavour'd to diſſwade her, but as ſhe was paſſionately fond of knowing future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; and had a mighty itch to be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive with the Oracle, about what might happen, not only to herſelf, but her Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it was agreed that he ſhould have the liberty of ſatisfying her Curioſity, ſince ſhe preſum'd her Fortune was ſure to be ſo Good, and was ſo forward and eager for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. But (alaſs!) ſuch is too often the fantaſtical Impulſe of Nature unluckily depraved, that it carries often into wiſhes of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0180400100:164"/>
knowing, what when known we would be glad to unknow again, and then our Memory will not let us be untaught.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Irwin</hi> was at that time in a pretty commodious way of Buſineſs, every thing in Plenty round about her, and liv'd more like a Perſon of Diſtinction, that kept ſuch a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Wine, open Houſe, and a free Table, than like one who kept a Tavern. She brought in her Three pretty Children, that were then almoſt Babies, the youngeſt having not long been out of the Nurſes Arms, or truſted to the uſe of its own Legs. Theſe Children ſhe lov'd as a Mother ſhould love Children; they were the delight of her Eyes all Day, and the Dream of her Imagination all Night. All the Paſſions of her Soul were confin'd to them; ſhe was never pleas'd but when they were ſo, and always angry if they were croſs'd; her whole Pride was centered in them, and they were cloath'd and went attended more like the Infants of a Princeſs, than of a Vintner's Relict. The Fortune of theſe was what ſhe had near at Heart, and of which ſhe was ſo eager of being immediately apprized. Her Impatience was proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the love ſhe had for them, and which made her wiſh to fore-know all the Happineſs that was like to attend them. She ſate chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully down, preſented one to him, and ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrote the Queſtion in general Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> is this Boy to be Happy or Unhappy.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0180400100:165"/>
A melancholy Look once more ſpread itſelf all over the Face of the Predictor, when he read the too inquiſitive Words, and he ſeem'd mightily to regret being ask'd a Queſtion, to which he was by his Talent of fore-ſeeing, compell'd to give ſo unwelcome an Anſwer. The Colour of the poor Woman fluſh'd and vaniſh'd alternately, and very quick, and ſhe look'd not quite like the Picture of Deſpair, but a diſconſolate Woman, with little Hopes on one Hand, and great Doubts and diſmal Fears on the other. She profeſs'd ſhe read great Evil in the Troubles of his Face, thank'd him for his good nature, told him, that they all knew, that though he could fore-tell, he could not alter the acts and decretals of Fate, and therefore deſir'd him to tell her the worſt; for that the Misfortunes, were they never ſo great, would be leſs dreadful to her, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the State of Fear and Suſpenſion. He at laſt wrote down to her that great and unexpected and even unavoidable Accidents would involve the whole Family in new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, that the Son ſhe ask'd him about would have the bittereſt task of Hardſhip to go through withal, while he lived, and that to finiſh all more unhappily, he would be baſely and maliciouſly brought to an untimely End, by ſome mortal Enemy or other, but that ſhe ſhould not trouble herſelf ſo much on that head, ſhe would never ſee it, for it would happen ſome Years after ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0180400100:166"/>
from the World. This melancholy Account clos'd up the Book of Predictions for that Day, and put a ſad ſtop to all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Mirth and Curioſity. Now I muſt tell the Reader how and when the event anſwer'd the Prediction. And in a few Words it was thus; poor Mrs. <hi>Irwin,</hi> by ſtrange Accidents decay'd in the World, and dying Poor, her Sons were forc'd to be put out Apprentices to ſmall Trades, and the Son, whom the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Prediction concern'd, was, for ſtealing one Cheeſe from a Man in the <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market,</hi> ſeverely proſecuted at the <hi>Old Bailey,</hi> and on Wedneſday the Twenty Third of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> 1713. hang'd at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> with ſeveral other Criminals.</p>
            <p>The Two foregoing Paſſages are of ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical a Nature, that it is time I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Minds of my Readers, with ſome Hiſtories of Ladies, who conſulted him with more Succeſs and Advantage, to whom his Predictions were very entertaining, when they ſo came to paſs in their Favour, the Relation whereof, will conſequently be agreeable to all Readers, who have within them a mixture of happy Curioſity and good Nature.</p>
            <p>Two Ladies, who were the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beauties in <hi>London,</hi> and the moſt courted, turn'd at the ſame time their Thoughts to Matrimony, and being ſatiated, I may ſay, wearied with the Pleaſure, of having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually after them a great number and variety
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0180400100:167"/>
of Adorers, reſolv'd each, about the ſame time, to make a choice of their ſeveral Men, to whom, they thought, they could give moſt Happineſs, and from whom they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive moſt. Their Names (for they are both Perſons of Diſtinction) ſhall be <hi>Chriſtallina</hi> and <hi>Urbana. Chriſtallina</hi> was a Virgin, and <hi>Urbana</hi> a young Widow. <hi>Chriſtallina</hi> engroſs'd the Eyes, the Hearts, and the Sighs, of the whole Court, and wherever ſhe appeared, put any Court Lady out of her Place, that had one before in the Heart of any Youth; and was the celebrated Toaſt among the <hi>Beau Monde. Urbana</hi>'s Beauty made as terrible Havock in the City: All the Citizens Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that had many Admirers, and were in fair Hopes of having Husbands, when they pleas'd themſelves; aſſoon as <hi>Urbana</hi> had loſt her old Husband, found that they every Day loſt their Lovers, and 'twas a general fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the prettieſt Maids, that they ſhould remain Maids ſtill, as long as <hi>Urbana</hi> remain'd a Widow. She was the Monopolizer of City Affection, and made many Girls, that had large ſtocks of Suiters, Bankrupts in the Trade of Courtſhip, and broke ſome of their Hearts, when her Charms broke off their Amours.—Well but the Day was near at Hand, when both the <hi>Belles</hi> of the Court and the City Damſels were to be freed from the ravages, which theſe Two Tyrants, triumphant in Beauty, and inſolent in Charms, made among
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0180400100:168"/>
the Harveſt of Love. Each had ſeen her proper Man, to whom the Enjoyment of her Perſon was to be dedicated for Life. But it being an Affair of ſo laſting Importance, each had a mind to be let into the knowledge of the conſequences of ſuch a Choice, as far as poſſible, before they ſtep'd into the irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable State of Matrimony. Both of them happen'd to take it into their Heads, that the beſt way to be entirely ſatisfied in their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, was to have recourſe to the great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictor of future Occurrences, Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> whoſe Fame was at that Time ſpread pretty largely about the Town. <hi>Chriſtallina</hi> and <hi>Urbana,</hi> were not acquainted with each other, only by the report which Fame had made of Beauty. They came to Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>'s on the ſame Day, and both with the ſame reſolution of keeping themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd and under Masks, that none of the Company of Conſulters, who happen'd to be there, might know who they were. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that on that very Day, juſt when they came, Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Rooms were more than ordinarily crowded, with curious Clients of the fair Sex, ſo that he was oblig'd to deſire theſe Two Ladies, who expreſs'd ſo much precaution againſt, and fear of having their Perſons diſcover'd, to be contented with only one Room between them, and with much ado, they comply'd with the requeſt, and condeſcended to ſit together <hi>Incog.</hi> Diſtant
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0180400100:169"/>
Compliments of Geſture paſs'd between them, (the dreſs and comportment of each making them appear to be Perſons of Figure and Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) and after Three or Four modiſh Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies down they ſat, without ſo much as once opening their Lips, or intending ſo to do. The Silence between them was very formal and profound for near half an Hour, and nothing was to be heard but the ſnapping of Fans, which they both did very tuneably and with great Harmony, and plaid, as it were in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort.</p>
            <p>At laſt one of the <hi>civil well bred Mutes,</hi> happening to <hi>Sneeze,</hi> the other very gracefully bow'd, and before ſhe was well aware, out popp'd the Words—Bleſs you Madam, the fair Sneezer return'd the Bow, with an—I thank you Madam. They found they did not know one another's Voices; and they began to talk very merrily together, with pretty great confidence, and they taking a mutual liking from Converſation, ſo much familiarity grew thereupon inſtantly between them, that they began not only to unmask, but to unboſom themſelves to one another, and confeſs alternately all their Secrets. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallina</hi> own'd who ſhe was, and told <hi>Urbana</hi> the Beau and Courtier that had her Heart. <hi>Urbana</hi> as franckly declared that ſhe was a Widow, that ſhe would not become the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Rival, that ſhe had pitch'd upon a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Husband, an Alderman of the City.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0180400100:170"/>
Juſt by that time they had had their chat out, and wiſh'd one another the pleaſure of a ſucceſsful Prediction, it came to <hi>Chriſtallina</hi>'s turn to viſit the Dumb Gentleman, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his Pen oracular Anſwers, to all the Queſtions ſhe had to propoſe. Well, he accordingly ſatisfied her in every Point ſhe ask'd him about; but while ſhe was about this; one of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Family going with <hi>Urbana</hi> to divert her a little: The Widow railed at the Virgin as a Fool, to immagin that ſhe ſhould ever make a Conqueſt of the brighteſt Spark about the Court, and then let ſhe ſome random bolts of Malice to wound her Reputation for Chaſtity: Now it became the Widow's turn to go and conſult: And the ſame Perſon of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Family, in the mean time entertain'd <hi>Chriſtallina.</hi> The Maid was not behind hand with the Widow; ſhe rail'd againſt the Widow, repreſented her as ſometimes a Coquette, ſometimes a Lady of Pleaſure, ſometimes a Jilt, and lifted up her Hands in Wonder and Amazement, that <hi>Urbana</hi> ſhould immagin ſo rich a Man, as an Alderman, <hi>ſuch a one,</hi> ſhould fall to her Lot. Thus <hi>Urbana</hi> ſwore and proteſted that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallina</hi> could never arrive at the Honour of being the Wife to the courtly <hi>Secretarius,</hi> let Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> flatter her as he would; and <hi>Chriſtallina</hi> vow'd, that <hi>Campbell</hi> muſt be a downright <hi>Wizard,</hi> if he foretold, that ſuch a one as <hi>Urbana</hi> would get Alderman <hi>Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rump</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0180400100:171"/>
for a Husband, provided a Thing ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable ſhould come to paſs.</p>
            <p>However, it ſeems, <hi>Duncan</hi> had told them their own Names and the Names of their Suiters, and told them further, how ſoon they were both to be married, and that too directly to their Heart's content, as they ſaid rejoicing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to themſelves, and made their mutual Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations.</p>
            <p>They went away each ſatisfied, that ſhe ſhould have her own Lover, but <hi>Chriſtallina</hi> laugh'd at Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> for aſſigning the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman to <hi>Urbana;</hi> and <hi>Urbana</hi> laugh'd at him for promiſing the Courtier to the Arms of <hi>Chriſtallina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a pretty good Figure of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Two reigning Toaſts, with regard to one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their Curioſity made them, from reſolving to be concealed, diſcover one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilfully, from utter Strangers grow as familiar as old Friends in a Moment, ſwear one another to Secrecy, and exchange the Sentiments of their Hearts together, and from being Friends become envious of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's enjoying a Similitude of Happineſs; the Compliments made on either ſide Face to Face, were, upon the turning of the Back, turn'd into Reflections, Detraction, and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule; each was a Self-lover and Admirer of her own Beauty and Merit, and a Deſpiſer of the other's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0180400100:172"/>
However, <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> proved at laſt to be in the right; <hi>Urbana</hi> was wrong in her opinion of <hi>Chriſtallina</hi>'s want of power over <hi>Secretarius,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtallina</hi> was as much out in her opinion, that <hi>Urbana</hi> would miſs in her aim of obtaining <hi>Stiffrump:</hi> For they both prov'd in the right of what they thought, with regard to their own dear ſingle Perſons, and were made happy according to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, juſt at the time foretold by Mr. <hi>Campbell.</hi>

               <hi>Chriſtallina</hi>'s ill Wiſhes did not hinder <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bana</hi> from being Miſtreſs of Alderman <hi>Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rump</hi>'s Perſon and Stock, nor did <hi>Urbana</hi>'s hinder <hi>Chriſtallina</hi> from ſhewing herſelf a ſhining Bride at the Ring in <hi>Secretarius</hi>'s gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chariot, drawn by Six Prancers of the proud <hi>Belgian</hi> Kind, with her half dozen of Liveries, with Favours in their Hats, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her return at the Gate of <hi>Hyde-park.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both lov'd and both envy'd, but both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Fore-knowledge.</p>
            <p>Having told you Two very ſorrowful Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and one tolerably ſucceſsful and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; I ſhall now relate to you another of my own knowledge, that is mix'd up with the Grievous and the Pleaſant, and checquer'd, as it were, with the Shade and the Sun-ſhine of Fortune.</p>
            <p>Though there are Viciſſitudes in every Stage or Life under the Sun; and not one ever ran continually on with the ſame ſeries
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0180400100:173"/>
of Proſperity; yet thoſe Conditions, which are the moſt liable to the ſignal Alterations of Fortune, are the Conditions of Merchants; for profeſt Gameſters I reckon in a manner as Men of no condition of Life at all; but what comes under the Statute of Vagabonds.</p>
            <p>It was indeed, as the Reader would gueſs, a worthy and a wealthy Merchant, who was to run through theſe different Circumſtances of Being. He came and viſited our Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> in the Year, 1707. he found him amidſt a Croud of Conſulters; and being very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſolicitous to know his own Fortune, juſt at that critical juncture of time, he begg'd of him (if poſſible) to adjourn his other Clients to the Day following, and ſacrifice that one wholly to his uſe; which as it was probably more important than all the others together, ſo he wrote down that he would render the time ſpent about it more advantagious to Mr. <hi>Campbell;</hi> and, by way of previous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, threw him down Ten Guineas as a retaining Fee.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> who held Money in very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſteem, and valued it ſo much too little, that he has often had my Reprehenſions on that head, pauſed a little, and after looking earneſtly in the Gentleman's Face, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, as I ſuppoſe, in that little ſpace of time in general, according to the power of the Second Sight, that what concern'd him was highly momentous, wrote him this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0180400100:174"/>
that he would comply with his requeſts, adjourn his other Clients to the Day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſet apart all the remnant of that, till Night, for inſpecting the future Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, of which he had a mind to be made a Maſter.</p>
            <p>There is certainly a very keen Appetite in Curioſity: It cannot ſtay for ſatisfaction; it is preſſing for its neceſſary repaſt, and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all patience: Hunger and Thirſt are not Appetites more vehement and more hard and difficult to be repreſs'd, than that of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: Nothing but the <hi>preſent Now</hi> is able to allay it. A more expreſſive Picture of this I never beheld, than in the Faces of ſome, and the murmurs and complaints of others, in that little inquiſitive Company, when the unwelcome Note was given about ſignifying an Adjournment, for only Twenty Four Hours.</p>
            <p>The Colour of a young Woman there, came and went a Hundred times (if poſſible) in the ſpace of Two Minutes; ſhe bluſh'd like a red Roſe this Moment, and in the ſwitch of an Eye-laſh ſhe was all over as pale as a white one: The Suiter, whoſe Name, her Heart had gone pit a pat for the ſpace of an Hour, to be inform'd of from the Pen of a Seer, was now deferr'd a whole Day longer; ſhe was once or twice within an ace of ſwooning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but he comforted her in particular, by telling her (though he ſaid it only by way of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0180400100:175"/>
jeſt) that the Day following would be a more lucky Day to conſult about Husbands, than the preſent, that ſhe came on. The Anſwer was a kind of Cordial to her hopes, and brought her a little better to herſelf.</p>
            <p>Two others, (I remember) Siſters and old Maids, that it ſeems were Miſers, Women ordinarily dreſt, and in blue Aprons, and yet by relation worth no leſs than Two Thouſand Pounds each, were in a peck of Troubles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his going and leaving them unſatisfied. They came upon an enquiry after Goods that were ſtolen, and they complained that by next Morning at that time, the Thief might be got far enough off, and creep into ſo remote a corner, that he would put it beyond the power of the Devil, and the art of Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find him out, and bring him back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The diſturbance and anxiety that was to be ſeen in their Conntenances, was juſt like that, which is to be beheld in the Face of a great loſing Gameſter, when his all, his laſt great Stake, lies upon the Table, and is juſt ſweeping off by another winning Hand into his own Hat.</p>
            <p>The next was a Widow, who boune'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as ſhe pretended, he would not tell her what was beſt to do with her Sons, and what Profeſſion it would be moſt happy for them to be put to; but in reality all the Cauſe of the Widow's fuming and fretting, was, not that ſhe wanted to provide for her
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0180400100:176"/>
Sons, but for herſelf; ſhe wanted a Second Husband, and was not half ſo ſolicitous about being put in a way of educating thoſe Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſhe had already, as of knowing when ſhe ſhould be in a likelyhood of getting more. This was certainly in her Thoughts, or elſe ſhe would never have flounc'd about in her Weed, from one end of the Room to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the while of her Paſſion ſmile by Fits upon the Merchant, and leer upon a young pretty <hi>Iriſh</hi> Fellow that was there. The young <hi>Iriſh-man</hi> made uſe of a little Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>language: She grew appeas'd, went away in quite a good humour, skutled too airily down Stairs, for a Woman in her cloaths, and the reaſon was certainly that ſhe knew the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before, which we took notice of preſently after: The <hi>Iriſh-man</hi> went precipitately after her down Stairs without taking his leave.</p>
            <p>But neither were the Two Miſers for their Gold, the Virgin for a firſt Husband, nor the Widow for a Second, half ſo eager, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther married Woman there, was for the death of her Spouſe. She had put the Queſtion in ſo expecting a manner for a lucky Anſwer, and with ſo much keen deſire appearing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in her looks; that no big belly'd Woman was ever more eager for devouring Fruit; no young haſty Bridegroom, juſt married to a Beauty, more impatient for Night and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, than ſhe was to know, what ſhe thought a more happy Moment, the Moment
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0180400100:177"/>
of her Husband's laſt agonizing Gaſp. As her Expectation was the greateſt, ſo was her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment too, and conſequently her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order upon his going and leaving her unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd. She was frantick, raging and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; ſhe was in ſuch a Fury at the delay of putting off her Anſwer to the Day following, that in her fury, ſhe acted as if ſhe would have given herſelf an Anſwer, which of the Two ſhould die firſt, by choaking herſelf upon the ſpot, with the Indignation that ſwell'd in her Stomach, and roſe into her Throat on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. It may look like a Romance to ſay it; but indeed they were forc'd to cut her Lace, and then ſhe threw out of the Room with great Paſſion.—But yet had ſo much of the enraged Wife left, (beyond the enrag'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) as to return inſtantly up Stairs, and ſignify very calmly, ſhe would be certain to be there next Day, and beſeech'd earneſtly that ſhe might not meet with a Second Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.</p>
            <p>All this hurry and buſtle created a ſtay, a little too tedious for the Merchant, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be impatient himſelf, eſpecially when Word was brought up, that a freſh Company was come in: But Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> was deny'd to them; and to put a ſtop to any more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions, the Merchant and the dumb Gentleman agreed to ſlip into a Coach, drive to a Tavern in the City, and ſettle matters of Futurity over a Bottle of <hi>French</hi> Claret.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0180400100:178"/>
The firſt Thing done at the Tavern, was Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s ſaluting him upon a piece of Paper by his Name, and drinking his Health. The next Paper held a Diſcourſe of condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance for a Diſaſter that was paſt long ſince, namely a great and conſiderable loſs that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to his Family, in the dreadful Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of the City of <hi>London.</hi> In the Third little Dialogue which they had together, he told the Merchant that Loſſes and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages were general Topicks, which a Perſon unskill'd in that Art might venture to aſſign to any Man of his Profeſſion; it being next to impoſſible that Perſons who traffick ſhould not ſometimes gain, and ſometimes loſe.—But ſaid Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> I will sketch out particularly, and ſpecify to you ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Misfortunes, with which you will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably meet: 'Tis in your Stars, it is in Deſtiny that you ſhould have ſome Trials, and therefore when you are forewarn'd take a prudent care to before-arm'd with Patience, and by longanimity, and meekly, and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, enduring your Lot, render it more eaſy, ſince Impatience can't avert it, and will only render it more burthenſome and heavy. He gave theſe Words to the Merchant; who preſs'd for his Opinion that Moment. By your leave (reſuming the Pen ſaid the Dumb Gentleman in writing) we will have this Bottle out firſt and tap a freſh one, that you may be warm'd with Courage enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0180400100:179"/>
the firſt Speculative onſett of ill fortune, that I ſhall predict to you, with a good grace, and that may perhaps enable you to meet it, when it comes to reduce it ſelf into action, with a manful Purpoſe and all becoming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. The Merchant agreed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and put on an Air of the careleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different as well as he could, to ſignify that he had no need to raiſe up an artificial Courage from the auxiliary forces of the Grape. But Nature, when hard preſs'd, will break thro' all diſguiſes, and not only notwithſtanding the Air of Pleaſantry he gave himſelf, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd forced and conſtrain'd, but in ſpite of Two or Three ſparkling and enlivening Bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, a Cloud of Care would ever and anon gather and ſhoot heavily croſs his Brow, tho' he labour'd all he could to diſpel it as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to keep fair Weather in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Well, they had crack'd the firſt Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and the Second ſucceeded upon the Table, and they call'd to blow a Pipe together. This Pipe Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> found had a very ill Effect: It is certainly a penſive kind of Inſtrument; and fills a Mind any thing ſo diſpoſed with diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts, black fumes, and melancholy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, as certainly as it doth the Mouth with ſmoke. It plainly took away even the little Sparks of Vivacity, which the Wine had given before; ſo he wrote for a truce of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe ſort of noxious Guns any longer, and they laid down their Arms by conſent, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0180400100:180"/>
drank off the Second Bottle. A Third im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſupply'd its place, and at the firſt Glaſs the opening of the Bottle, Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> began to open to him his future caſe, in the following Words. Sir, you have now ſome Ventures at Sea from ſuch and ſuch a Place to ſuch a value. Don't he diſcomforted at the News which you certainly will have within three Months, (but 'twill be falſe at laſt) that they are by three different Tempeſts made the Prey of the great Ocean, and enrich the Bottom of the Sea, the Palace of <hi>Neptune.</hi> A worſe Storm than all theſe attends you at home, a Wife who is and will be more the Tempeſt of the Houſe wherein ſhe lives. The high and lofty Winds of her Vanity will blow down the Pillars of your Houſe and Family; the High-tide of her Extravagance will roll on like a reſiſtleſs Torrent and leave you at low Water, and the Ebb of all your Fortunes. This is the Higheſt and the moſt cutting Diſaſter that is to befal you; your real Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck is not foreign but domeſtick; your boſom Friend is to be your greateſt Foe, and even your powerful Undoer for a time; mark what I ſay, and take Courage, it ſhall be but for a time, provided you take Courage; it will upon that condition be only a ſhort and wholeſome taſte of Adverſity given to you, that you may reliſh returning Proſperity with Virtue, and with a greater Return of thanks to him, that diſpenſes it at pleaſure to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0180400100:181"/>
Remember Courage and Reſignation is what I adviſe you to; uſe it (as becomes you) in your Adverſity, and believe that as I foretold that Adverſity, ſo I can foretel a Proſperity will again be the conſequence of thoſe Virtues; and the more you feel the one, ought not to caſt you down, but raiſe your hopes the more, that he who foretold you that ſo exactly, could likewiſe foretel you the other. The Merchant was by this put into a great ſuſpence of Mind, but ſomewhat ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, by the Second Prediction being annex'd ſo kindly to the firſt fatal one. They crown'd the Night with a flask of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and then parting, each went to their reſpective Homes.</p>
            <p>The Reader may perchance wonder how I, who make no mention of my being there, (as in Truth I was not at the Tavern) ſhould be able to relate this as of my own knowledge; but if he pleaſes to have patience to the end of the Story, he will have entire ſatisfaction in that Point.</p>
            <p>About half a Year after, the Merchant came again, told him that his Prediction was too far verify'd, to his very dear coſt, and that he was now utterly undone, and beyond any viſible means of a future recovery, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leaſt the other fortunate Part of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was only told him by way of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, (for groundleſs Doubts and Fears always attend a Mind implung'd in Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly) beſought him very earneſtly to tell
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0180400100:182"/>
him candidly and ſincerely, if there was no real Proſpect of Good, and rid him at once of the Uneaſineſs of ſuch a Suſpenſion of Thought; but pray too, ſaid he, with all the vehemence of repeated Expoſtulation, ſatisfy me, if there are any further hopes on this ſide the Grave?</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> made a ſhort, but a very ſignificant reply in writing. May the Heaven's preſerve you from a threat'ning dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Life. Take care only of yourſelf, great and mighty care, and if you outlive Friday next, you will yet be great and more fortunate, than ever you was in all the height of your former moſt flouriſhing ſpace of Life. He colour'd inordinately when <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Campbell</hi> ſaid Friday, and conjur'd him to tell him as particularly as he could what he meant by Friday. He told him he could not particularize any further, but that great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger threaten'd him that Day; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extraordinary Precaution, it would prove fatal to him, even to death. He ſhook his Head, and went away in a very ſorrowful Plight. Friday paſt, Saturday came, and on that very Saturday Morning came likewiſe the joyful Tidings that, what Ventures of his were given over for loſt, at Sea, were all come ſafe into the Harbour. He came the Moment he receiv'd thoſe diſpatches from his Agent, to Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi>'s Apartment, embrac'd him tenderly, and ſaluted him with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0180400100:183"/>
much gladneſs of Heart, before a great Room full of Ladies, where I happen'd to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at that time; crying out in a loud Voice, before he knew what he ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> had ſav'd his Life, that Friday was his Birth-day, and he had intended with a Piſtol to ſhoot himſelf that very Day. The Ladies thought him mad; and he, recover'd from his Exſtacy, ſaid no more, but ſate down, till Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> diſmiſs'd all his Clients; and then we Three went to the Tavern together, where he told me the whole little Hiſtory or Narrative, juſt as is above related.</p>
            <p>The Fame which Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> got by the foregoing, and ſeveral other Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the like kind, was become very large and extenſive, and had ſpread itſelf into the remoteſt Corners of this Metropolis. The Squares rung with it, it was whiſper'd from one Houſe to another, through the more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Streets, where Perſons of Quality and Diſtinction reſide, it catch'd every Houſe in the City, like the News of Stock from <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-alley,</hi> it run noiſily through the Lanes and little Thorough-fares where the poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit; it was the Chat of the Tea-table, and the Babble of the Streets, and the whole Town, from the top to the bottom, was full of it. Whenever any Reputation riſes to a degree like this, let it be for what Art or Accompliſhment or on what account ſoever it will, Malice, Envy and Detraction, are ſure
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0180400100:184"/>
to be the immediate Purſuers of it with full Mouth, and to hunt it down, if poſſible, with full Cry. Even the great <hi>Noſtra-damus,</hi> tho' favour'd by Kings and Queens, (which always without any other reaſon creates Enemies) was not more purſued by Envy and Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for his Predictions in <hi>Paris</hi> and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>France,</hi> than our <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> was in <hi>London,</hi> and even throughout <hi>England.</hi> Various, different, and many were the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections rais'd to blot his Character and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate his Fame, that, when one was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, another might not be wanting to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply its place, and ſo to maintain a courſe and ſeries of back-biting, according to the known Maxim.—<hi>Throw dirt, and if it does not ſtick, throw dirt continually, and ſome will ſtick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is there any wonder; for a Man, that has got Applauders of all ſorts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, muſt expect Condemners and Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of all ſorts and conditions likewiſe. If a Lady of high Degree, for example, ſhould ſay ſmiling, (though really thinking abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what ſhe ſays) for fear of being thought over-credulous:—Well, I vow, ſome things Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> does are ſurprizing after all; they would be apt to incline one to a belief, that he is a wonder of a Man, for one would imagin the things he does impoſſible;—why then a Prude with an aſſumed ſupercilious Air, and a ſcornful <hi>Tihee,</hi> would in order to ſeem more wiſe than ſhe was, reply; Laud,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0180400100:185"/>
Madam, 'tis more a wonder to me that you can be impoſed upon ſo.—I vow to Gad, Madam, I would aſſoon conſult an Almanack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and pin my Faith upon what he pricks down; or believe, like my Creed, in the croſs which I make upon the Hand of a <hi>Gypſie.</hi>—Lard, Madam, I aſſure your La'ſhip he knows no more than I do of you.—I aſſure you ſo, and therefore believe me.—He has it all by hear-ſay.—If the Lady that believ'd it, ſhould reply, that if he had notice of every Stranger by hear-ſay, he muſt be a greater Man than ſhe ſuſpected, and muſt keep more Spies in pay, than a Prime Miniſter. The <hi>Prude</hi>'s Anſwer would be with a <hi>loud Laugh</hi> and gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling out theſe Words.—Lard, Madam, I aſſure you nothing can be more eaſy; and ſo take it for granted. Becauſe ſhe was inclin'd to ſay ſo, and had the act of Wiſdom on her ſide, forſooth, that ſhe appear'd hard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, (which ſome call hard to be put upon) and the other Lady credulous, (which ſome though believing upon good grounds are call'd) and ſo thought fooliſh; the Prude's Anſwer would be thought ſufficient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing.</p>
            <p>Thus Malice and Folly, by dint of Noiſe and Impudence, and ſtrong though empty Aſſertions, often run down Modeſty and good Senſe. Among the common People it is the ſame, but only done in a different manner. For Example, an ordinary Perſon that had
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0180400100:186"/>
conſulted, might ſay (as he walk'd along) There goes the dumb Gentleman, who writes down any Name of a Stranger at firſt Sight. Steps up a blunt Fellow, that takes Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs for Senſe, and ſays—that is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded Lye; he is a Cheat and an Impoſtor, and you are one of his Accomplices. He'll tell me my Name, I ſuppoſe, if you tell it him firſt. He is no more dumb than I am; he can ſpeak and hear as well as us, I have been with thoſe that ſay they have heard him; I wiſh I and Two or Three more had him in our Stable, and I warrant you with our Cart-whips we would lick ſome Words out of his Chops, as dumb as you call him.—I tell you 'tis all a Lye and all a Bite.—If the other deſires to be convinc'd for himſelf by his own Experience.—The rougher Rogue, who perhaps has ſtronger Sinews than t'other, anſwers, if you lye any further, I will knock you down, and ſo he is the vulgar Wit, and the Mouth of the Rabble-rout, and thus the Detraction ſpreads below with very good ſucceſs, as it does above in another kind.</p>
            <p>As there are Two comical Adventures in his Life, which directly ſuit and correſpond with the foregoing Reflections, this ſeems the moſt proper Place to inſert them in. The firſt conſiſts of a kind of Mobb-way of Uſage he met with from a Fellow, who got to be an Officer in the Army, but by the following Behaviour will be found unworthy of the Name, and the Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0180400100:187"/>
In the Year 1701, a Lady of good Quality came and addreſs'd herſelf to him much after the following manner. She told him ſhe had Choice of Lovers, but preferr'd one above the reſt; but deſir'd to know his Name, and if ſhe made him her Choice, what would be the ſubſequent Fate of ſuch a Matrimony. Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> very readily gave her down in writing, this plain and honeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; that of all her Suiters, ſhe was moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to a Captain, a diſtinguiſh'd Officer, and a great Beau, (naming his Name) and one that had a great many outward engaging Charms, ſufficient to blind the Eyes of any Lady that was not thoroughly acquainted with his Manner of living. He therefore aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, (and thought himſelf bound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conjured, ſo to do, having received his Fee, though there was Danger in ſuch plain and open Predictions,) that he was a Villain and a Rogue in his Heart, a profligate Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and that if ſhe took him to her Bed, ſhe would only embrace her own Ruin. The Lady's Woman, who was preſent, being in Fee with the Captain, reſolving to give Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for fear the Officer her ſo good Friend ſhould be diſappointed in the Siege: ſlily ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the Papers into her Pocket, and made a Preſent of them to the military Spark. Fir'd with Indignation at the Contents, he vow'd Revenge; and in order to compaſs it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires with his female Spy about the Means.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0180400100:188"/>
In fine, for fear of loſing the Lady though he quarrel'd with <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> a Method was to be found out how to ſecure her by the very Act of Revenge. At laſt it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to diſcover to her, that he had found out what ſhe had been told by Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> but the Way how he had been inform'd was to remain a Secret. He did do ſo and ended his Diſcovery with theſe Words: I deſire, Madam, that if I prove him an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, you would not believe a Word he ſays.—The Lady agreed to ſo fair a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.—Then the Captain ſwore that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would never eat a Piece of Bread more till he had made Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> eat his Words; nay he inſiſted upon it, that he would bring him to his Tongue, and make him own by Word of Mouth, that what he had written before was falſe and calumnious. To which the Lady anſwer'd again, that, if he perform'd what he ſaid, ſhe would be convinced. This brave military Man, however, not relying upon his own ſingle Valour and Proweſs, to bring about ſo miraculous a thing as the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Perſon, that was dumb, to ſpeak: He took with him for this End three luſty Aſſiſtants to combine with him in the Aſſaſſination. The Ambuſcade was ſettled to be at the Five Bells Tavern in <hi>Witch-ſtreet</hi> in the <hi>Strand.</hi> After the Ambuſh was ſettled with ſo much falſe Courage the Buſineſs of decoying Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> into it, was not practicable any other way,

than by ſending out falſe Colours. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Woman, who was by her own Intereſt tied faſt to the Intereſt of the Beau, was to play the trick of <hi>Dalila,</hi> and betray this deaf and dumb <hi>Sampſon</hi> (as he will appear to be a kind of one in the ſequel of the Story) into the Hands of theſe <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> She ſmooths her Face over with a complimenting Lye from her Miſtreſs to Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> and acted her Part of Deceit ſo well that he promis'd to follow her to the Five Bells with all haſte; and ſo ſhe skuttled back to prepare the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and to tell him how lucky ſhe was in Miſchief; and how ſhe drew him out by Smiles into Perdition. The ſhort of the Story is, when they got him in among them, they endeavour'd to aſſaſſinate him; but they miſs'd of their Aim; yet 'tis certain they leſt him in a very terrible and bloody Condition; and the Captain went away in as bad a Plight as the Perſon was left in, whom he aſſaulted ſo cowardly with Numbers, and to ſuch Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. I was ſent for to him upon this Diſaſter, and the Story was deliver'd to me thus, by one of the Drawers of the Tavern, when I inquir'd into it. They began to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and ſpeaking to him as if he heard, ask'd him if he knew his own Fortune; they told him it was to be beaten to Death. This was an odd way of addreſſing a deaf and dumb Man. They added they would make him ſpeak before they had done. The Boy

ſeeing he made no Reply, but only ſmiled; thought what paſs'd between them was a Jeſt, with an old Acquaintance, and withdrew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Buſineſs. The Door being faſten'd, however, before they began the honourable Attack they vouchſafed to write down their Intent, in the Words above-mentioned which they had uttered before, to make ſure that he ſhould underſtand their meaning, and what this odd way of Correction was for. All the while the Maid, who had brought him into it, was peeping through a Hole, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Event, as appears afterwards. Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> wrote them the following Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> that he hop'd for fair Play; that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

The Rejoinder they made to this, conſiſted it ſeems not of Words but of Action. The Officer in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with another Ruffian, one of the ſtrongeſt of the Three he had brought, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced the Aſſault. As good luck would have it, he warded off their firſt Blows (it ſeems) with tolerable Succeſs, and a Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quart-pot ſtanding upon the Table, <hi>Duncan</hi> took to his Arms, and at Two or Three quick Blows, well manag'd, and cloſe laid in upon the Aſſailants, fell'd them both to the Ground. Here it was that the Maid diſcover'd her Knowledge of it, and Privity to the Plot, to the whole Houſe; for the no ſooner ſees the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0180400100:191"/>
famous Leader, the valiant Captain, lie ſprau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the Floor with bleeding Temples, but ſhe ſhriek'd out, with all the Voice ſhe could exert, Murder, Murder, Murder! Alarm'd at this Out-cry, the Maſter and all the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of the Tavern ſcamper'd up Stairs, burſt into the Room, and found <hi>Duncan Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> ſtruggling with the other Two, and the Quart-pot ſtill faſt clench'd in his Hand, which they were endeavouring to wrench from him. The Drawers reſcu'd him out of their Hands, and inquir'd into the Matter. The Maid in a fright confeſs'd the whole Thing. The Officer and his Aſſociate rub'd their Eyes as recovering from a ſtunning Sleep, reel'd as they went to riſe, paid the Reckoning, and ſlunk pitifully away, (or as the Rakes Term for it is,) they bruſh'd off, and for all their Odds had the worſt of the Lay. I who had ſome Authority with Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> by reaſon of my Years, and the ſtrict Acquaintance I had with his Mother, when I came and found him in that pickle, and had the whole Relation told me by the People of the Houſe, though I could not forbear pitying him within my own Mind, took upon me to reprehend him, and told him that theſe Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips would by Providence be daily permitted to fall upon him (for he met with them Twenty Times) while he continued in that irregular way of Living and ſpending his Time, that might be ſo precious to himſelf
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0180400100:192"/>
and many others, in Drunkenneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery; and I think the Leſſons I wrote down to him upon that Head, though a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſevere juſt at that juncture, were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding well tim'd, and did, as I gueſs'd they would, make a more ſolid Impreſſion in him than at any other. In all theſe Scuffles (whether it is that being deaf and dumb an Affront works deeper upon a Man, and ſo renders him far more fierce or reſolute) it muſt be ſaid, that, though Nature has been kind in making him very Strong, Robuſt, and Active with all, yet he has bore ſome Shocks, one would imagin beyond the Strength of a Man, having ſometimes got the better of Five or Six Ruſſians in Rencounters of the like kind.</p>
            <p>The next Banter he met with was in a gentler way, from an unbelieving Lady, and yet ſhe came off with very ill ſucceſs, and the Banter turn'd all upon herſelf in the End.</p>
            <p>A Lady of Diſtinction (whoſe Name ſhall therefore be conceal'd in this Place) came with Two or Three of her ſpecial Friends, who took her for the moſt merry innocent ſpotleſs Virgin upon Earth, and whoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty was never ſuſpected in the leaſt by her Relations or Servants that were neareſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout here after having rally'd Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>

by him told, that he did not take Fees in his Profeſſion to be made a Jeſt of like a common Fortune-teller, but to do real Good to thoſe who conſulted him, as far as he was able by his Predictions; that he was treated with more Reſpect by Perſons of a higher Condition, though her own was very good, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd her Guinea back again with a Bow and a Smile. She had a little more Generoſity of Spirit than not to be a little nettled at the Proffer ſhe had caus'd by ſo coarſe an Uſage. She affected appearing grave a little, and told him ſhe would be ſerious for the future, and ask'd him to ſet down her Name, which ſhe had neglected before, to ask other Queſtions that were nothing to the purpoſe. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to write it down, but pauſing a little longer than ordinary about it, ſhe return'd to her former way of uncivil Merriment and ungallant Raillery. She repeated to him in Three or Four little ſcraps of Paper one after another as faſt as ſhe could write them, the ſame Words, <hi>viz.</hi>—That he could not tell her Name, nor whether ſhe was Maid, Wife, or Widow; and laugh'd as if ſhe would ſplit her Sides, triumphing to the reſt of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, over his Ignorance and her own Wit, as if ſhe had pos'd him and put him to an entire Stand. But ſee what this over-ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Opinion of Security ended in: The Man of the Second Sight, was not to be ſo eaſily baffled. Vex'd at being ſo diſturb'd, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0180400100:194"/>
out of his brown Study, he reaches the Paper and begins to write.—Now it was the Lady's turn to ſuffer, ſhe had deſerv'd hearty Puniſhment, and it came into her Hands with the Note, to a degree of Severity; (as you will perceive by the Contents of it juſt now.)—She read it, and ſwooning away, drop'd from her Chair. The whole Room being in a buſtle, I that was in the outward Chamber ran in: While Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> was ſprinkling Water in her Face, a Lady ſnatch'd up the Note to read it, at which he ſeem'd migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily diſpleas'd; I therefore who underſtood his Signs recover'd it out of her Hands by Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, and ran to burn it, which I did ſo quick, that I was not diſcover'd in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, which I muſt own I ſatisfied myſelf in, by reading it firſt; a Curioſity rais'd too high, by ſo particular an Adventure, to be overcome in ſo little a Time of Thought, as I was to keep it in my Hands, and ſo I came by the knowledge of it myſelf, without being inform'd by Mr. <hi>Campbell.</hi> This ſhews how a ſudden Curioſity, when there is not Time given to think and correct it, may overcome a Man as well as a Woman; for I was never over-curious in my Life, and though I was pleas'd with the Oddneſs of the Adventure, I often bluſh'd to myſelf ſince for the unmanly Weakneſs, of not being able to ſtep with a Note, from one Room to another, to the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, without peeping into the Contents of it.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0180400100:195"/>
The Contents of it were theſe. Madam, ſince you provoke me, your Name is—You are no Widow, you are no Wife, and yet you are no Maid; you have a Child at Nurſe at ſuch a Place, by ſuch a Gentleman, and you were brought to Bed in <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi> The Lady convinc'd by this Anſwer, of his ſtrange and myſtical Power, and pleas'd with his Civility, in endeavouring to conceal from others the Secret, after ſo many repeated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, though ſhe ſhew'd great Diſorder for that Day, became one of his conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders ſome time after, and would not take any Step in her Affairs, without his Advice, which ſhe often has ſaid ſince, ſhe found very much to her Advantage. She was as ſerious in her dealings with him afterwards, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by being ſo, as ſhe was gay and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with him before, and ſmarted for it. In fine, ſhe was a thorough Convert, and a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of his; and the only Jeſt ſhe us'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to make, concerning him, was a civil Witticiſm to his Wife; to whom ſhe was wont, every now and then, ſmiling, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs herſelf, after this manner. Your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Madam, is a Devil, but he is a very handſome, and a very civil one.</p>
            <p>Not long after this came another Lady, with a like intent, to impoſe upon him, and was reſolv'd (as ſhe own'd) to have laugh'd him to ſcorn, if ſhe had ſucceeded in her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. She had very dexterouſly dreſs'd her
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0180400100:196"/>
ſelf in her Woman's Habit, and her Woman in her own; her Footman <hi>ſquired</hi> the new made Lady in a very gentlemanly Dreſs hir'd, for that purpoſe of a diſguiſe, from <hi>Monmouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet.</hi> The ſtrange and unknown Maſquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders enter'd Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Room with much Art. The Fellow was by Nature of a clean Make, and had a good Look, and from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a genteel Maſter, when he was young, copy'd his Gait a little, and had ſome Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Mien, and a tolerable good Air a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. But this being the firſt time of his being ſo fine, and he a little vain in his Temper, he over-acted his Part; he ſtrutted too much; he was as fond of his Ruffles, his Watch, his Sword, his Cane, and his Snuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box, as a Boy of being newly put into Breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and view'd 'em all too often to be thought the Poſſeſſor of any ſuch things long. The Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the Chamber-maid was inſufferable; She had the Toſs of the Head, the Jut of the Bum, the ſide-long Leer of the Eye, the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Look upon her Lady, now degraded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Woman, that ſhe was intolerable, and a Perſon without the Gift of the Second Sight, would have gueſs'd her to have been a prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Upſtart, tho' 'tis very probable, that during that time, ſhe fancy'd herſelf real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly better than her Miſtreſs: The Miſtreſs acted her Part of Maid the beſt, for it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier for genteel Modeſty to act a low Part, than for affected Vanity to act a high one. She
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0180400100:197"/>
kept her diſtance like a Servant, but would, to diſguiſe things the better, be every now and then pert, according to their Way, and give Occaſion to be chid. But there is an Air of Gentility in-born and in-bred to ſome People, and even when they aim to be awkward, a certain Grace will attend all their minuteſt Actions and Geſtures, and command Love, Reſpect, and Veneration. I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore own, that there was not need of a Man's being a Conjurer, to gueſs who ought to be the Lady, and who the Maid; but to know who abſolutely was the Lady, and who was the Maid, did require that Skill. For how many ſuch real Ladies have we, that are made ſo from ſuch Upſtarts, and how many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel waiting Women of great Deſcent, that are born with a Grace about them, and are bred to good Manners. Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Art made him poſitive in the Caſe; he took the Patches from the Face of the Maid, and plac'd them on the Miſtriſſes; he pull'd of her Hood and Scarf and gave it the Lady, and taking from the Lady her Ridinghood, gave it the Maid in exchange; for Ladies at that time of Day were not enter'd into that Faſhion of cloaking themſelves. Then he wrote down that he ſhould go out, and ought to ſend his Maid in to undreſs them quite, and give the Miſtriſs her own Cloaths and the Maid hers, and with a Smile wrote down both their Names and commended her contrivance; but
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0180400100:198"/>
after that, it was remark'd by the Lady, that he pay'd her leſs Reſpect than ſhe expected, and more to her Footman, who was in Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Habit, whom he took by his Side, and told a great many fine things; whereas he would tell the Lady nothing further. The Lady nettled at this, wrote to him that ſhe had Vanity enough to believe that ſhe might be diſtinguiſh'd from her Maid in any Dreſs; but that he had ſhown his want of Skill in not knowing who that Gentleman was. Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> told her her miſtake in ſharp Terms; and begging her pardon aſſured her he knew ſeveral Chamber-maids as genteel and as well-born as her, and many Miſtreſſes more aukward and worſe-born than her Maid; that he did not go therefore by the Rule of gueſs and judging what ought to be, but by the Rule of Certainty, and the Knowledge of what actually was. She however unſatisfy'd with that Anſwer perplex'd him mightily to know, who the Man was. He anſwer'd he would be a great Man.—The Lady laugh'd ſcornfully, and ſaid ſhe wanted to know who he was, not what he would be.—He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd again.—He was her Footman, but that ſhe would have a worſe.—She grew warm and deſired to be inform'd, why, ſince he knew the Fellow's Condition, he reſpected her to little and him ſo much; and accuſed him of want of practiſing Manners, if he had not went of Knowledge. He anſwer'd, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0180400100:199"/>
ſince you will be asking Queſtions too far.—This Footman will advance himſelf to the Degree of a Gentleman, and have a Woman of Diſtinction to his Wife; while you will degrade yourſelf by a Marriage to be the Wife of a Footman. His Ambition is laudable, your Condeſcenſion mean, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I give him the Preference, I have given you fair warning and wholeſome advice, you may avoid your Lot by Prudence; but his will certainly be what I tell you.</p>
            <p>This coming afterwards to paſs, exactly as was predicted, and his diſappointing ſo many that had a mind to impoſe upon him, has render'd him pretty free from ſuch wily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances ſince, though now and then they have happen'd, but ſtill to the mortification and diſappointment of the Contrivers. But as we have not pretended to ſay, with regard to theſe things, that he has his <hi>Genius</hi> always at his Elbow or his Beck, to whiſper in his Ear the Names of Perſons, and ſuch little conſtant Events as theſe; ſo, that we may not be deemed to give a fabulous Account of his Life and Adventures, we think ourſelves bound to give the Reader an inſight, into the particular Power and Capacity which he has, for bringing about theſe particular Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, eſpecially that of writing down Names of Strangers at firſt Sight, which I don't doubt will be done to the ſatisfaction of all

            <p>MR. <hi>Martin</hi> lately publiſh'd a Book, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>A Deſcription of the Weſtern Iſles of</hi> Scotland, <hi>called by the Ancient Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Hebrides.</hi> It contains many <hi>curious</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, relating to the natural and civil Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of thoſe <hi>Iſlands,</hi> with a Map of them; and in his Preface he tells us, that perhaps it's <hi>Peculiar</hi> to thoſe <hi>Iſles,</hi> that they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been deſcribed, till now, by any Man, that was a Native of the Country, or had travell'd them as himſelf has done; and in the Concluſion of the ſaid Preface, he tells us, he has given here ſuch an Account of the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> as the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> will <hi>bear,</hi> which has always been reckon'd <hi>ſufficient</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>unbyaſs'd</hi> Part of Mankind; but for <hi>thoſe,</hi> that will <hi>not</hi> be <hi>ſatisfy'd,</hi> they ought to <hi>oblige</hi> us with a <hi>new Scheme,</hi> by which we may <hi>judge</hi> of <hi>Matters of Fact.</hi> The <hi>chief Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars</hi> he has given us concerning the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sight,</hi> are here ſet down, by way of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract or Epitome, that they may not be too tedious to the Reader.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0180400100:201"/>
1. In the Second Sight the <hi>Viſion</hi> makes ſuch a <hi>lively Impreſſion</hi> on the <hi>Seers,</hi> that they neither <hi>ſee</hi> nor <hi>think</hi> of <hi>any thing elſe,</hi> but the <hi>Viſion,</hi> as long as it continues. And then they appear <hi>Penſive</hi> or <hi>Jovial,</hi> according to the <hi>Object,</hi> which was preſented to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. At the Sight of a Viſion, the Eye-lids of the Perſon are erected, and the Eyes continue ſtaring till the Object vaniſh, as has often been obſerv'd by the Author and others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is one in <hi>Skye,</hi> an Acquaintance of whom obſerv'd, that when he ſees a Viſion, the inner Part of his Eylids turns ſo far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that, after the Object diſappenrs, he muſt draw them down with his Fingers, and ſometimes employs others to draw them down, which he finds to be much the eaſier way.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Faculty of the <hi>Second Sight</hi> does not lineally deſcend in a Family, as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; for he knows ſeveral Parents that are endow'd with it, but not their Children; and ſo on the contrary: Neither is it acquir'd by any previous Compact; and after a ſtrict Enquiry, he could never learn from any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that this Faculty was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable any way whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That this Account is differing from the Account that is given by Mr. <hi>Aubrey,</hi> a Gentleman of the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> and I think Mr. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Reaſon here againſt the Deſcent
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0180400100:202"/>
of this Faculty from Parents to Children, is not generally concluſive. For tho' he may know Parents endow'd with it, and not Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and ſo <hi>vice verſâ;</hi> yet there may be Parents, who are endow'd with it, being qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd as Mr. <hi>Aubrey</hi> has ſaid, (<hi>viz.</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Second Sighted, or even <hi>one</hi> to an <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> Degree) whoſe Children may have it by deſcent. And as to this Faculty's being any otherways communicable (ſince the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts differ) I muſt leave it to a further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Seer</hi> knows neither the Object, Time nor Place of a Viſion before it appears, and the ſame Object is often ſeen by different Perſons, living at a conſiderable diſtance from one another. The true Way of judging as to the Time and Circumſtance of an Object, is by Obſervation; for ſeveral Perſons of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without this Faculty, are more capable to judge of the Deſign of a Viſion, than a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that is a <hi>Seer.</hi> As an Object appears in the Day or Night, it will come to paſs ſooner or later accordingly.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If an Object be ſeen early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which is not frequent) it will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd in a few Hours afterwards: If at Noon, it will commonly be accompliſh'd that very Day: If in the Evening, perhaps that Night; if after Candles be lighted, it will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd that Night: It's later always in Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, by Weeks, Months, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0180400100:203"/>
Years, according to the Time of the Night the Viſion is ſeen.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When a Shroud is perceiv'd about one, it's a ſure Prognoſtick of Death; the Time is judg'd according to the Height of it about the Perſon; for if it be not ſeen above the Middle, Death is not to be expected for the ſpace of a Year, and perhaps ſome Months longer; and as it is frequently ſeen to aſcend higher towards the Head, Death is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be at hand in a few Days, if not Hours, as daily Experience confirms. Examples of this kind were ſhown the Author, when the Perſons, of whom the Obſervations were made, enjoy'd perfect Health.</p>
            <p>There was one Inſtance lately of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of this kind, by a <hi>Seer</hi> that was a Novice, concerning the Death of one of the Author's Acquaintance; this was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to a few only, and with great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: The Author being one of the Number, did not in the leaſt regard it, till the Death of the Perſon, about the Time foretold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to him the certainty of the Prediction. The foreſaid <hi>Novice</hi> is now a <hi>ſkilful Seer,</hi> as appears from many late Inſtances: He lives in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, the moſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern in <hi>Skye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. If a Woman be ſeen ſtanding at a Man's left Hand, it's a Preſage that ſhe will be his Wife, whether they are married to others, or unmarried, at the Time of the Apparition.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0180400100:204"/>
If Two or Three Women are ſeen at once, ſtanding near a Man's left Hand, ſhe that is next him will undoubtedly be his Wife firſt, and ſo on, whether all Three, or the Man, be ſingle, or married, at the Time of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; of which there are ſeveral late Inſtances of the Author's Acquaintance. It's an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing for them to ſee a Man, that is to come to the Houſe ſhortly after; and tho' he be not of the <hi>Seers</hi> Acquaintance, yet he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells his Name, but gives ſuch a lively Deſcription of his Stature, Complexion, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that upon his Arrival he anſwers the Character given of him in all reſpects. If the Perſon ſo appearing be one of the <hi>Seer</hi>'s Acquaintaince, he can tell by his Countenance whether he comes in good or bad Humour. The Author has been ſeen thus, by <hi>Seers</hi> of both Sexes, at ſome Hundreds of Miles Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Some that ſaw him in this manner, had never ſeen him perſonally, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd according to their Viſions, without any previous Deſign of his to go to thoſe Places, his coming there being purely accidental; and in the Nineteenth Page of his Book, he tells us, that Mr. <hi>Daniel Morriſon</hi> a Miniſter, told him, that upon his landing in the Iſland <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the Natives receiv'd him very affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and addreſſed themſelves to him with this Salutation: God ſave you Pilgrim! You are heartily welcome here, for we have had repeated Apparitions of your Perſon amongſt

us; <hi>viz.</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Second Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. It's ordinary with them to ſee Houſes, Gardens, and Trees, in Places void of all Three, and this in proceſs of Time uſes to be accompliſh'd; of which he gives an Inſtance in the <hi>Iſland of Skye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. To ſee a Spark of Fire fall upon one's Arm, or Breaſt, is a Fore-runner of a dead Child to be ſeen in the Arms of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of which there are ſeveral freſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>To ſee a Seat empty at the time of one's ſitting in it, is a Preſage of that Perſon's Death quickly after.</p>
            <p>When a Novice, or one, that has lately obtain'd the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> ſees a Viſion in the Night-time without Doors, and comes near a Fire he preſently falls into a Swoon.</p>
            <p>Some find themſelves, as it were in a Croud of People, having a Corpſe which they carry along with them; and after ſuch Viſions the <hi>Seers</hi> come in ſweating, and deſcribe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that appear'd; if there are any of their Acquaintance among them, they give an Account of their Names, and alſo of the Bearers. But they know nothing concerning the Corpſe.</p>
            <p>All thoſe, that have the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> do not always ſee theſe Viſions at once, though they are together at the Time; but if one, who has this Faculty, deſignedly touch his

               <hi>fellow Seer,</hi> at the Inſtant of a Viſion's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then the <hi>Second</hi> ſees it as well as the <hi>Firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. There is the way of fore-telling Death by a <hi>Cry,</hi> that they call <hi>Taisk,</hi> which ſome call a <hi>Wrath</hi> in the <hi>Low-land.</hi> They hear a <hi>loud Cry</hi> without Doors, exactly reſembling the Voice of ſome particular Perſon, whoſe Death is foretold by it, of which he gives a late Inſtance, which happen'd in the Village <hi>Rigg</hi> in <hi>Skye Iſle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. Things are alſo fore-told by <hi>ſmelling</hi> ſometimes, as follows. Fiſh or Fleſh is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſmelt in the Fire, when at the ſame Time neither of the Two are in the Houſe, or, in any probability like to be had in it, for ſome Weeks or Months. This Smell ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons have, who are endued with the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> and it's always accompliſh'd ſoon after.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Children, Horſes,</hi> and <hi>Cows,</hi> have the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> as well as Men and Women ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in Years.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Children</hi> ſee it, it is plain, from their <hi>crying</hi> aloud at the very Inſtant, that a Corpſe or any other Viſion appears to an ordinary <hi>Seer:</hi> Of which he gives an Inſtance in a Child, when himſelf was preſent.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Horſes</hi> likewiſe ſee it's very plain, from their violent and ſudden ſtarting, when the Rider, or <hi>Seer</hi> in Company with them, ſees a Viſion of any kind by Night or Day. It's
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0180400100:207"/>
obſervable of a Horſe, that he will not go forward that way, till he be led about at ſome diſtance from the common Road, and then he is in a Sweat: He gives an Inſtance of this in a Horſe, in the Iſle of <hi>Skye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Cows</hi> have the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> appears from this; that if a Woman milking a <hi>Cow</hi> happens to ſee a Viſion by the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> the <hi>Cow</hi> runs away in a great fright at the ſame time, and will not be pacify'd for ſome time after.</p>
            <p>In Reference to this <hi>Paracelſus, Tom.</hi> 9. <hi>l. de arte preſagâ,</hi> writes thus, <q rend="inline">'Horſes alſo have their Auguries, who perceive, by their <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Smell,</hi> wandering <hi>Spirits, Witches</hi> and <hi>Spectres,</hi> and the like Things; and Dogs both ſee and hear the ſame.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here in the next place the Author anſwers Objections that have lately been made againſt the <hi>Reality</hi> of the <hi>Second Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's objected, that theſe <hi>Seers</hi> are <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary</hi> and <hi>melancholy</hi> People, who <hi>fancy</hi> they <hi>ſee</hi> Things, that do <hi>not</hi> appear to <hi>them</hi> or <hi>any Body elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He anſwers, The <hi>People</hi> of theſe <hi>Iſles,</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> the <hi>Seers,</hi> are very Temperate, and their Diet is ſimple and moderate in Quantity and Quality; ſo that their Brains are not, in all probability, diſordered by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted Fumes of Meat or Drink. Both Sexes are free from Hyſterick Fits, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſeveral other Diſtempers of that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0180400100:208"/>
Sort. There are no Madmen among them, nor any Inſtance of Self-murther. It's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among them, that a Man <hi>drunk</hi> never has a Viſion of the <hi>Second Sight;</hi> and he that is a <hi>Viſionary</hi> would diſcover himſelf in other things as well as in that; nor are ſuch, as have the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> judg'd to be <hi>Viſionaries</hi> by any of their Friends or Acquaintaince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's objected, that there are none among the Learned able to oblige the World with a ſatisfactory Account of theſe Viſions; therefore they are not to be believed.</p>
            <p>He anſwers, If every Thing, of which the <hi>Learned</hi> are <hi>not able</hi> to give a ſatisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſhall be <hi>condemn'd</hi> as <hi>Falſe</hi> and <hi>Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> we ſhall find <hi>many</hi> other Things, <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believ'd,</hi> which muſt be <hi>rejected</hi> as <hi>ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's objected, that the <hi>Seers</hi> are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, and the People, who believe them, are credulous, and eaſy to be impos'd upon.</p>
            <p>He anſwers, The <hi>Seers</hi> are, generally illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, and well-meaning People, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther void of Deſign; nor could he ever learn that any of them made the leaſt gain of it; neither is it reputable among them to have that Faculty: Beſide the People of the Iſles are not ſo credulous as to believe an Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, before the thing foretold be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd; but when it actually comes to paſs, afterwards it is not in their Power to deny it, without offering Violence to their Senſes and Reaſon: Beſide, if the <hi>Seers</hi> were <hi>Deceivers,</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0180400100:209"/>
can it be reaſonable to imagin, that all the <hi>Iſlanders,</hi> who have not the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> ſhould combine together, and offer Violence to their Underſtandings and Senſes, to force themſelves to believe a Lye from Age to Age? There are ſeveral Perſons among them, whoſe Birth and Education raiſe them above the Suſpicion of concurring with an Impoſture, merely to gratify an illiterate and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſort of Perſons. Nor can a reaſonable Man believe, that <hi>Children, Horſes,</hi> and <hi>Cows,</hi> could be engaged in a Combination to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World of the <hi>Reality</hi> of a <hi>Second Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every Viſion that is ſeen, comes exactly to paſs, according to the rules of Obſervation, though Novices and heedleſs Perſons do not always judge by thoſe Rules; concerning which he gives Inſtances.</p>
            <p>There are Viſions ſeen by ſeveral Perſons, in whoſe Days they are not accompliſh'd; and this is one of the Reaſons, why ſome Things have been ſeen, that are ſaid never to have come to paſs; and there are alſo ſeveral Viſions ſeen, which are not underſtood till they are accompliſh'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Sight</hi> is not a late Diſcovery, ſeen by one or two in a Corner, or a remote <hi>Iſle;</hi> but it's ſeen by many Perſons of both Sexes, in ſeveral Iſles, ſeparated about Forty or Fifty Leagues from one another: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of many of theſe Iſles never had
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0180400100:210"/>
the leaſt Converſe by Word or Writing: And this Faculty of ſeeing Viſions having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as we are inform'd by Tradition, ever ſince the Plantation of theſe <hi>Iſles,</hi> without being diſproved by the niceſt Sceptick after the ſtricteſt Inquiry, ſeems to be a clear Proof of its Reality.</p>
            <p>It's obſervable, that it was much more common Twenty or Thirty Years ago, than at preſent; for One in Ten does not ſee it now, that ſaw it then.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Sight</hi> is not confin'd to the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Iſles</hi> alone, the Author having an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that it's in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Holland,</hi> but particularly in <hi>Bommel,</hi> where a Woman has it, for which ſhe is courted by ſome, and dreaded by others. She ſees a Smoak about one's Face, which is the fore-runner of the death of a Perſon ſo ſeen, and ſhe actually foretold the deaths of ſeveral that lived there. She was living in that Town a few Winters ago.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Sight</hi> is likewiſe in <hi>the Iſle of Man,</hi> as appears by this Inſtance. Captain <hi>Leathes</hi> the chief Commander of <hi>Bellfaſt</hi> in his Voyage 1690, loſt Thirteen Men by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storm, and upon his landing in the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> an ancient Man, Clerk to a Pariſh there, told him immediately that he had loſt Thirteen Men there; the Captain enquired how he came to the Knowledge of that; he anſwer'd that it was by <hi>Thirteen Lights,</hi> which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0180400100:211"/>
he had ſeen come into the Church-yard; as Mr. <hi>Sacheverel</hi> tells us in his late Deſcription of the <hi>Iſle of Man.</hi> Note, that this is like the Sight of the <hi>Corpſe-candles</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> which is alſo well atteſted.</p>
            <p>Here the Author adds <hi>many</hi> other Inſtances concerning the <hi>Second Sight</hi> of which I ſhall ſet down only a <hi>few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Man in <hi>Knockow,</hi> in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, the northermoſt Part of <hi>Skye,</hi> being in perfect Health, and ſitting with his fellow Servants at Night, was on a ſudden taken ill, drop'd from his Seat backward, and then fell a vomiting; at which the Family was much concern'd, he having never been ſubject to the like before; but he came to himſelf ſoon after, and had no ſort of Pain about him. One of the Family, who was accuſtomed to ſee the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> told them that the Man's Illneſs proceeded from a very ſtrange Cauſe, which was thus. An ill-natur'd Woman (whom he named) who lives in the next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Village of <hi>Bornskittag,</hi> came before him in a very angry and furious Manner, her Countenance full of Paſſion, and her Mouth full of Reproaches, and threaten'd him with her Head and Hands, till he fell over, as you have ſeen him. This Woman had a Fancy for the Man, but was like to be diſappointed as to her marrying of him. This Inſtance was told the Author, by the Maſter of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0180400100:212"/>
Family, and others, who were preſent when it happen'd.</p>
            <p>Sir. <hi>Norman Macklead,</hi> and ſome others, playing at <hi>Tables,</hi> at a Game called in <hi>Iriſh, Falmermore,</hi> wherein there are Three of a Side, and each of them throw the Dice by turns, there happened to be one difficult Point in the diſpoſing of one of the <hi>Table-men:</hi> This obliged the Gameſter to deliberate, before he was to change his <hi>Man,</hi> ſince, upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of it, the winning or loſing of the Game depended; at length the Butler, who ſtood behind, adviſed the Player, where to place the <hi>Man,</hi> with which he comply'd and won the Game. This being thought extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and Sir <hi>Norman</hi> hearing one whiſper him in the Ear, ask'd who advis'd him ſo skilfully? He anſwer'd it was the Butler, but this ſeem'd more ſtrange, for it was generally thought he could not play at Tables. Upon this Sir <hi>Norman</hi> ask'd him how long it was ſince he had learn'd to play? And the Fellow own'd that he had never play'd in his Life, but that he ſaw the Spirit <hi>Brownie</hi> (a Spirit uſually ſeen in that Country) reaching his Arm over the player's Head, and touching the Part with his Finger, where the Table-man was to be placed. This was told the Author by Sir <hi>Norman,</hi> and others, who happen'd to be preſent at the Time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daniel Bow</hi> alias <hi>Black,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Bornskittag,</hi> who is one of the preciſeſt <hi>Seers</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0180400100:213"/>
in the Iſles, foretold the death of a young Woman in <hi>Minginis,</hi> within leſs than Twenty Four Hours before the Time, and accordingly ſhe died ſuddenly in the Fields; though at the Time of the Prediction ſhe was in perfect health; but the Shrou'd appearing cloſe about her Head, was the Ground of his Confidence, that her Death was at Hand.</p>
            <p>The ſame Perſon foretold the Death of a Child in his Maſter's Arms, by ſeeing a Spark of Fire fall on his left Arm, and this was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe accompliſh'd ſoon after the Prediction.</p>
            <p>Some of the Inhabitants of <hi>Harries,</hi> ſailing round the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Skye</hi> with a Deſign to go to the oppoſite Main-land, were ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with an Apparition of Two Men hanging down by the Ropes that ſecured the Maſt, but could not conjecture what it meant; they purſued their Voyage, but the Wind turning contrary, they were forced into <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Skye,</hi> where they found Sir <hi>Donald Mackdonald</hi> keeping a Sherriffs Court, and Two Criminals receiving Sentence of Death there. The Ropes and Maſt of that very Boat were made uſe of to hang thoſe Criminals. This was told the Author by ſeveral, who had this Inſtance related to them by the Boat's Crew.</p>
            <p>Several Perſons, living in a certain Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, told the Author, that they had frequently ſeen Two Men ſtanding at a Gentlewoman's left-hand, who was their Maſter's Daughter;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0180400100:214"/>
they told the Men's Names, and being her Equals, it was not doubted but ſhe would be marry'd to one of them; and perhaps to the other, after the Death of the firſt. Sometime after a Third Man appeared, who ſeemed always to ſtand neareſt to her of the Three, but the <hi>Seers</hi> did not know him, though they could deſcribe him exactly; and, within ſome Months after, this Man, who was ſeen laſt, actually came to the Houſe, and fully anſwer'd the Deſcription given of him, by thoſe, who never ſaw him, but in a Viſion; and he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the Woman ſhortly after: They live in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Skye,</hi> and both themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers confirm'd the Truth of this Inſtance, when the Author ſaw them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Archibald Mack Donald</hi> of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Skye,</hi> being reputed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in his Skill of foretelling things to come by the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> happening to be in the Village <hi>Knockow</hi> one Night, and before Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, told the Family, that he had juſt then ſeen the ſtrangeſt Thing he ever ſaw in his Life: <hi>viz.</hi> A Man with an ugly long Cap, always ſhaking his Head; but that the ſtrangeſt of all was a little kind of an Harp, which he had, with Four Strings only, and that it had Two Hart's-horns fix'd in the front of it: All that heard this odd Viſion fell a laughing at <hi>Archibald,</hi> telling him, that he was dreaming, or had not his Wits about him, ſince he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſee a Thing which had no Being,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0180400100:215"/>
and was not ſo much as heard of in any Part of the World. All this could not alter <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi>'s Opinion, who told them, that they muſt excuſe him, if he laugh'd at them, after the Accompliſhment of the Viſion. <hi>Archibald</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his own Houſe, and within Three or Four Days after, a Man with a Cap, Harp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came to the Houſe, and the Harp, Strings, Horns, and Cap, anſwer'd the Deſcription of them at firſt View, and he ſhook his Head when he play'd; for he had Two Bells fix'd to his Cap. This Harper was a poor Man, who made himſelf a Buffoon for his Bread, and was never ſeen before in thoſe Parts, and at the Time of the Prediction he was in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Barray,</hi> which is about Twenty Leagues diſtant from that Part of <hi>Skye.</hi> This Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vouch'd by Mr. <hi>Daniel Martin,</hi> and all his Family, and ſuch as were then preſent, and they live in the Village where this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Daniel Nicholſon,</hi> Miniſter of St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s in <hi>Skye,</hi> the Pariſh, in which Mr. <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald Mac Donald</hi> lived, told the Author; that, one Sunday, after Sermon, at the Chappel <hi>Uge,</hi> he took an occaſion to inquire of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald,</hi> if he ſtill retain'd that unhappy Faculty of ſeeing the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> and wiſh'd him to get rid of it, if poſſible; for, ſaid he, it's no true Character of a good Man. <hi>Archibald</hi> was highly diſpleas'd, and anſwer'd that he hoped he was no more unhappy than his Neighbours,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0180400100:216"/>
for ſeeing what they could not perceive. I had, ſaid he, as ſerious Thoughts as my Neighbours in time of hearing a Sermon to Day, and even then I ſaw a Corpſe laid on the Ground cloſe to the Pulpit; and I aſſure you it will be accompliſh'd ſhortly, for it was in the Day-time. There were none in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh then Sick, and few are buried at that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Chappel, nay ſometimes not one in a Year. Yet when Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> return'd to preach in the ſaid Chappel, a Fort-night or three Weeks after, he found one buried in the very Spot, named by <hi>Archibald.</hi> This Story is vouch'd by Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> the Miniſter, and ſeveral of the Pariſhioners ſtill living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That it's counted by many an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſomewhat evil attending this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> becauſe there are Inſtances given of ſome Perſons, who have been freed of it, upon uſing ſome Chriſtian Practices. But I ſhall hereafter ſhow that this Opinion cannot be entirely true.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Norman Mac-Lead,</hi> who has his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Bernera,</hi> which lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Iſles</hi> of <hi>N. Viſt</hi> and <hi>Harries,</hi> went to the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Skye</hi> about Buſineſs, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing any Time for his Return; his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, in his Abſence, being all together in the large Hall at Night; one of them, who had the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> told the reſt they muſt remove, for there would be abundance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Company in the Hall that Night: One of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0180400100:217"/>
his fellow Servants anſwered, that there was very little Likelyhood of that, becauſe of the Darkneſs of the Night, and the Danger of coming through the Rocks, that lie round the <hi>Iſle:</hi> But within an Hour after, one of Sir <hi>Norman</hi>'s Men came to the Houſe, bidding them provide Lights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for his Maſter had newly landed.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Norman</hi> being told of this, called for the <hi>Seer</hi> and examin'd him about it. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that he had ſeen the Spirit <hi>Brownie,</hi> in humane Shape, come ſeveral times, and make a ſhow of carrying an old Woman, that ſate by the Fire, to the Door, and at laſt ſeem'd to carry her out by Neck and Heels, which made him laugh heartily, and gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the reſt to conclude him Mad, to laugh ſo much without any Reaſon. This Inſtance was told the Author by Sir <hi>Norman</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>Four Men from the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Skye</hi> and <hi>Harries,</hi> went to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and ſtaid there ſome Years; who, though they had wont to ſee the <hi>Second Sight</hi> in their native Country, never ſaw it in <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> but upon their Return to <hi>England,</hi> the firſt Night after their landing, they ſaw the <hi>Second Sight;</hi> as the Author was told by ſeveral of their Acquaintaince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Morriſon,</hi> who lives in <hi>Bernera</hi> of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> wears the Plant called <hi>Fuga Daemonum</hi> ſewed in the Neck of his Coat, to prevent his ſeeing of Viſions, and ſays, he never ſaw
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0180400100:218"/>
any ſince he firſt carried that Plant about him.</p>
            <p>A Spirit, by the Country People called <hi>Brownie,</hi> was frequently ſeen in all the moſt conſiderable Families in the <hi>Iſles,</hi> and <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Shape of a tall Man, having very long brown Hair: But within theſe Twenty Years paſt he has been ſeen but rarely.</p>
            <p>There were Spirits alſo that appeared in the ſhape of Women, Horſes, Swines, Cats, and ſome like fiery Balls, which would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Men in the Fields, but there have been but few Inſtances of theſe for upwards of Forty Years paſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe Spirits us'd alſo to form Sounds in the Air, reſembling thoſe of an Harp, Pipes, crowing of a Cock, and of the grinding of Hand-mills: And ſometimes Voices have been heard in the Air at Night, ſinging <hi>Iriſh</hi> Songs; the Words of which Songs ſome of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Acquaintances ſtill retain, one of them reſembled the Voice of a Woman, who died ſometime before, and the Song related to her State in the other World. All theſe Accounts, the Author ſays, he had from Perſons of as great Integrity, as any are in the World. So far Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> whoſe Account is ſo long, that I have given the Reader only a ſhort A bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; and ſhall therefore ſatisfy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without relating any further Paſſages, by directing the Reader to others alſo, learned

Men, who have written on the ſame Subject. <hi>Laurentius Ananias</hi> printed a Volume in <hi>Latin</hi> at <hi>Venice, Anno</hi> 1581, about the Nature of <hi>Daemons,</hi> where, in the Third Book he writes concerning the <hi>Second Sight.</hi>—The learned <hi>Camerarius</hi> does the like, and names a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his own Acquaintance, whom he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies to have had that Gift.

Among our own Country-men: The Lord <hi>Henry Howard</hi> in the Book he writ againſt <hi>ſuppoſed Prophecies,</hi> in his Seventeenth Chapter tells us a wonderful Story, of this Kind of <hi>Sight;</hi> and ſure that noble Lord may be look'd upon as an unexceptionable Teſtimony, in a Story he relates of his own Knowledge, he having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe little Faith in things of this kind.

that Country, printed in <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1702 <hi>in Folio,</hi> has given us ſeveral Inſtances of this kind, as alſo of many other diabolical Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Mr. <hi>Aubrey</hi> Fellow of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Society, has written largely concerning <hi>Second ſighted</hi> Perſons; ſo has Mr. <hi>Beaumont</hi> in his Book of <hi>Genii</hi> and <hi>familiar Spirits,</hi> who has collected almoſt all the other Accounts together, and many others, whoſe very Names, it would be tedious, to recite: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as there are a few more Paſſages very curious in themſelves; I will venture ſo far upon the Reader's Patience, as not only to recite the Names of the Authors, but the Accounts themſelves, in as ſuccinct and brief a manner, as it is poſſible for any one to do.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Th.

            <p>A <hi>Scotch</hi> Noble-man ſent for one of theſe <hi>Second ſighted</hi> Men out of the <hi>High-lands</hi> to give his Judgment of the then great <hi>George Villiers,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> As ſoon as ever

he ſaw him; Piſh, ſaid he, <hi>he will come to Nothing, I ſee a Dagger in his Breaſt;</hi> and he was ſtabb'd in the Breaſt by Captain <hi>Felton,</hi> as has been at large recounted in ſome of the foregoing Pages.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>James Melvin</hi> hath ſeveral the like Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in his Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>A certain old Man in <hi>South Wales,</hi> told a great Man there of the Fortune of his Family, and that there ſhould not be a Third <hi>Male</hi> Generation: It has fallen out accordingly.</p>
            <p>Sir. <hi>William Dugdale</hi> with his own Mouth inform'd ſeveral Gentlemen, that Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Middleton (ſince Lord) went into the <hi>High-lands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to endeavour to make a Party for King <hi>Charles</hi> I. An old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (that was <hi>Second ſighted</hi>) came and told him that his Endeavour was good; but he would be unſucceſsful; and moreover, <hi>That they would put the King to death: And that ſeveral other Attempts would be made, but all in vain: But that his Son would come in, but not reign in a long Time: But would at laſt be reſtored.</hi> This Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> had a great Friendſhip with the Laird <hi>Bocconi,</hi> and they made an Agreement, that the firſt of them that died, ſhould appear to the other in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. The Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> was taken Priſoner at <hi>Worceſter</hi> Fight, and was Priſoner in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> under Three Locks. Lying in his Bed Penſive <hi>Bocconi</hi> appeared to him; my Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> ask'd him if he
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0180400100:222"/>
were dead or alive? He ſaid, dead, and that he was a Ghoſt; and told him that within Three Days he ſhould eſcape, and he did ſo, in his Wife's Cloaths; when he had done his Meſſage he gave a frisk and ſaid<q>
                  <l>

                  <l>In the World to ſee ſo ſudden a Change.</l>
               </q> And then gather'd up and vaniſhed. This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Sir. <hi>William Dugdale</hi> had from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> And this Account he hath writ in a Book of Miſcellanies, which is now repoſited (with other Books of his) in the <hi>Muſaeum</hi> at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Reader ſees what great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities may be produced to prove that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true Predictions have been delivered by many Perſons gifted with the <hi>Second Sight.</hi> The moſt learned Men in almoſt all Nations, who are not in all likelyhood deceiv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The moſt celebrated and authentick Hiſtorians, and ſome Divines, in <hi>England,</hi> who, 'tis not to be thought, have combined together and made it their Buſineſs to obtrude upon us Falſehoods; Perſons of all Ranks, from the higheſt to the loweſt, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who, it would be even Madneſs to think, would join in a Confederacy to impoſe Tricks upon us, and to perſwade us to the greateſt of Impoſtures as ſolemn Truths delivered from their own Mouths; all theſe (I ſay) have unanimouſly and (as it were) with <hi>one Voice</hi> aſſerted, repeated, and confirm'd, to us,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0180400100:223"/>
that there have been at all Times, and in many different Nations, and that ſtill there are Perſons, who, poſſeſs'd with the Gift of a <hi>Second Sight,</hi> predict Things that wonderfully come to paſs; and ſeem to merit very little leſs than the Name of Prophets, for their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Diſcoveries. Now if any Man ſhould come, and without giving the leaſt manner of Reaſon for it, (for there is no Reaſon to be given againſt ſuch Aſſertions) declare his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief</hi> of all theſe <hi>authentick,</hi> though <hi>ſtrange,</hi> Accounts; can he <hi>with Reaſon</hi> imagin that his <hi>Incredulity</hi> ſhall <hi>paſs</hi> for a <hi>Token</hi> of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> Shall his <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> confute the <hi>Learned?</hi> Shall his <hi>Want of Faith</hi> be thought <hi>juſtly</hi> to give the <hi>Lye</hi> to ſo <hi>many</hi> Perſons of the <hi>higheſt Honour</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> and of the <hi>moſt undoubted Integrity?</hi> In fine, ſhall his <hi>Infidelity,</hi> by a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> kind of <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>that</hi> which is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Philoſophers Stone,</hi> be able to <hi>change</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things, turn and tranſmute <hi>Truth</hi> into <hi>Falſehood,</hi> and make a <hi>down right plain Matter of Fact</hi> to be no more than a <hi>Chimera,</hi> or an <hi>Ens Rationis?</hi> And ſhall a <hi>manifeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> be <hi>ſo eaſily exploded?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taking it therefore for granted, that no modeſt Man whatſoever, (though never ſo hard of Belief, which is certainly as great a Weakneſs as that of too much Credulity) will make bold openly to declare his diſ-belief of Things ſo well atteſted; and taking it much more for granted ſtill, that it is impoſſible for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0180400100:224"/>
any Man of common Senſe to have the Front of declaring his Diſ-belief of them in ſuch a manner, as to urge it for an Argument and a Reaſon why others ſhould diſ-believe them too; taking this, I ſay, as I think I very well may, for granted, I think there remains nothing further for me to offer, before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter, except a few Remarks, as to the Similitude there is between thoſe Actions, which I have related above to have been performed by Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> and theſe Actions, which ſo many learned ingenious and noble Authors, as I have juſt now quoted, have aſſerted to have been performed by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom they knew to be gifted with the <hi>Second Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what is ſaid (ſeveral Pages above) concerning <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> when a Boy at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that he even told his little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who would have Succeſs at their little Matches, when they play'd at Marbles; and that he inform'd a great Gameſter there whoſe Name I have diſguiſed under that of Count <hi>Cog,</hi> what Times he ſhould chuſe to play if he would win, as ludicrous as it may have appear'd to be, and as much as it may have ſeem'd to my Readers to carry with it nothing better than the Face of Invention, and the Air of Fiction; yet if they will be at the pains of comparing that Paſſage of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Campbell</hi>'s, with the Account given in this Chapter from the Mouth of Sir <hi>Norman</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0180400100:225"/>
               <hi>Maclead,</hi> concerning a Man, who, though he never play'd at Tables in his Life, inſtructed a skilful Gameſter, when he was at a ſtand, to place one of his <hi>Men</hi> right, upon which the whole Game depended, which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Fellow, when ask'd how he came to do it, ſaid he was directed to by the Spirit <hi>Brownie;</hi> whoever I ſay will be at the pains of comparing theſe Paſſages together, will find they bear a very near reſemblance, and that the way we may moſt reaſonably account for <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi>'s Prediction, when he was a Boy, muſt be, that he was at that time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by his little <hi>Genius</hi> or <hi>familiar Spirit,</hi> which I deſcribed in the precedent Pages, as this Fellow was by the <hi>Spirit Brownie,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Sir <hi>Norman Maclead</hi>'s Aſſertion, which <hi>Spirit Brownie,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Marten</hi> a very good and credited Writer aſſures us, in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Weſtern Iſlands</hi> dedicated to the late Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> is a <hi>Spirit</hi> uſually ſeen all over that Country.</p>
            <p>If the Reader recollects, He will remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber likewiſe that, in the little Diſcourſe, which I mentioned to have been held between me and this <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> when a Boy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his little <hi>Genius,</hi> I there ſay, the Boy ſignified to me, that he ſmelt Veniſon, and was ſure that ſome would come to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe ſhortly after; accordingly I came thither that Morning from the Death of a Deer, and order'd a part of it to be brought
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0180400100:226"/>
after me to her Houſe. Now Mr. <hi>Marten</hi>'s Twelfth Obſervation about the <hi>Second Sight</hi> in this Chapter clears it plainly up that this Knowledge in the Boy proceeded from the <hi>Gift of Second Sight.</hi> Not to give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der too often the Trouble of looking back in order to judge of the Truth of what I ſay; I will here repeat that Obſervation; which is as follows. Things are alſo foretold by <hi>Smelling</hi> ſometimes: For Example <hi>Fiſh</hi> or <hi>Fleſh</hi> is frequently <hi>ſmelt</hi> in the Fire, when at the <hi>ſame time neither</hi> of the <hi>Two</hi> are in the Houſe, or, in any <hi>probability,</hi> like to be had in it, for ſome <hi>Weeks</hi> or <hi>Months.</hi> This <hi>Smell</hi> ſeveral Perſons have, who are endued with the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sight,</hi> and its always accompliſh'd ſoon after.</p>
            <p>But I will here omit any further Remarks by way of accounting how he compaſs'd his Predictions, when a Boy, either by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of his <hi>Genius,</hi> or the Gift of a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sight;</hi> and examin how nearly thoſe Things, which I have related to have been done by him in his more advanc'd Years, when he took up the Profeſſion of a <hi>Predictor</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> correſpond with the Accounts giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us in this Chapter about a <hi>Second Sight,</hi> and how near a Reſemblance the Things done by him bear to thoſe Things that are ſo well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to have been perform'd by others, thro' the efficacious Power of this wonderful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0180400100:227"/>
Firſt then, if we have a mind to make a tolerable gueſs, which way Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> came acquainted that the Death of the beautiful young Lady, Mrs. <hi>W<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>

                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> was ſo near at Hand, and that, tho' ſhe was ſo univerſally admired, ſhe would die unmarried; the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts given of other <hi>Second ſighted</hi> Perſons in the like Caſes, will put us in the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable way of gueſſing right. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by the Seventh Obſervation in this Chapter, where it is ſaid from Mr. <hi>Marten,</hi> that when a Shroud is perceiv'd about one, it's a ſure Prognoſtick of Death; the Time is judg'd according to the Height of it, about the Perſon; for if it be not ſeen above the Middle, Death is not to be expected for the ſpace of a Year or longer, but as it comes nearer to the Head it is expected ſooner; if to the very Head, it is concluded to be at Hand within a few Days, if not Hours. Of this we have an Example of which Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> was an Eye-witneſs, concerning the Death of his own Acquaintance; but he did not in the leaſt regard it, till the Death of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, about the Time foretold, confirm'd to him the Certainty of the Prediction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the ignominious Death, that <hi>Irwin</hi> came to, and which He predicted to his Mother, ſo long before, when ſhe was in flouriſhing Circumſtances, and when there was no appearance, that any of her Children ſhould be brought to a beggarly Condition,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0180400100:228"/>
and learn among baſe Gangs of Company to thieve, and be carried to the Gallows: The Story told in this Chapter of ſome of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Harries,</hi> ſailing round the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Skye,</hi> and ſeeing the Apparition of Two Men hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Ropes on the Maſt of their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and when they came to the oppoſite Main-Land, finding Two Criminals juſt ſentenc'd to Death, by Sir <hi>Donald Mac Donald,</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own very Maſt and Ropes made choice of for their Execution, clears up the manner how Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> might predict this of <hi>Irwin</hi> likewiſe by the force of the <hi>Second Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s telling <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallina</hi> the <hi>Belle</hi> and chief <hi>Toaſt</hi> of the Court, and <hi>Urbana</hi> the reigning Beauty of the City, that they ſhould ſhortly be married, and who were to be their Husbands; it is a Thing he has done almoſt every Day in his Life to one Woman or other, that comes to conſult him about the Man ſhe is to be married to; the manner, he probably takes in doing this, may be likewiſe explain'd by the foregoing Story in this Chapter, about the Servants, who ſaid they ſaw Three Men ſtanding by the left Hand of their Maſter's Daughter; and that <hi>he,</hi> that was <hi>neareſt</hi> would marry her <hi>firſt</hi> whom they plainly and exactly deſcribed, tho' they had never ſeen him but in their Viſion, as appeared afterwards. For within ſome Months after the very Man deſcribed did
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0180400100:229"/>
come to the Houſe, and did <hi>marry</hi> her. <hi>Vide</hi> the Eight Obſervation of the <hi>Second Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to the Predictions deliver'd by Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> to the Merchant, which are ſet down at length in the foregoing Chapter, I know no better way at gueſſing the <hi>manner how</hi> the <hi>Second Sight</hi> operated in him at that Time, than by comparing them to theſe Two Inſtances, which I briefly repeat, becauſe they are ſet down at length before, in this Chapter. And firſt it may be ask'd how did the <hi>Second Sight</hi> operate in Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> when it gave him to know, that the Merchant's Ships, which repeated Intelligences had in appearance confirm'd to be loſt, were at that time ſafe, and would return ſecurely home into the Harbour deſigned? The beſt way of accounting for it, that I know, is by the Story that Sir <hi>Norman Mack-Lead</hi> is above affirm'd to have told with his own Mouth concerning a Servant of his, who rightly foretold his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Home and landing on the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>era</hi> one Night, where his Reſidence is, when there was very little or no likelyhood of it, becauſe of the Darkneſs of the Night, and the Danger of coming through the Rocks that lie round the Iſle. When Sir <hi>Norman</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd him about it; he anſwer'd that he knew it by a Viſion of the Spirit <hi>Brownic:</hi> and hence it may be the moſt probably conjectured that Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Knowledge of the Merchant's Ships being ſafe, came from a Viſion of his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0180400100:230"/>
particular <hi>Genius</hi> or <hi>familiar Spirit</hi> which we ſpoke of before. What I have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in, is (I think) ſufficient with regard to the wonderful Things which Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> has perform'd either by the Intervention of a <hi>Genius</hi> or the Power of a <hi>Second Sight.</hi> But as he has frequently done a great many amazing Performances, which ſeem to be of ſuch a Nature, that they can't be well and clearly explain'd to have been done either by the Intervention of his <hi>familiar Spirit</hi> and <hi>Genius,</hi> or by the Power of the <hi>Second ſighted Faculty,</hi> we muſt have recourſe to the Third Means, by which only ſuch Predictions and Practices can be compaſs'd, before we expound theſe new Myſteries, which appear like incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Riddles, and <hi>Aenigma's</hi> at the firſt; and this <hi>Third Means</hi> which we muſt have recourſe to, for expounding theſe ſtrange Acts of his, is a due conſideration of the Force and Power of Natural Magick, which together with a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the Acts, which he ſeems <hi>magically</hi> to bring about, will be the Subject of the following Chapter.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
            <p>BUT before we proceed to our Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions concerning the Power and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of natural Magick, and examin what my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Operations may be brought about and compaſs'd by magical Practices, and before we take a further Survey of what Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> has perform'd in this kind, that relates to his Profeſſion and the publick Part of his Life, which concerns other People as well as himſelf; I ſhall here relate ſome ſingular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, that he paſs'd thoro' in his private Life, and which regard only his own Perſon. In order to this, I muſt return back to the Year 1702, about which time ſome unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Turns of Fortune attended him in his own private Capacity, which muſt be very ſurprizing and entertaining to my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when they find a Man, whoſe Fore-ſight was always ſo great a Help and Aſſiſtance to others, who conſulted him in their own fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Affairs, helpleſs (as it has been an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation concerning all ſuch Men in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Second Sight</hi>) and blind in his own future Affairs, toſs'd up and down by inevitable and ſpightful Accidents of Fortune, and made the May-game of Chance and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, as if that way-ward and inconſtant Goddeſs was reſolv'd to puniſh him, when
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0180400100:232"/>
ſhe catch'd him on the blind Side, for having ſuch a quick inſight and penetrating Faculty in other Peoples Matters, and ſcrutinizing too narrowly into her Myſteries, and ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preventing thoſe fatal Intentions of hers, into which ſhe would fain lead many Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals hood-wink'd, and before they knew where they were. In this Light, theſe mighty and famous <hi>Seers</hi> ſeem to be born for the Benefit and Felicity of others, but at the ſame time to be born to Unhappineſs themſelves. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, in as much as we conſider them as uſeful and beneficial often, but always ſatisfactory, to Perſons, who are curious in their Inquiries about their Fortunes; it will be natural to thoſe of us, who have the leaſt Share of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity in our Minds, to yield our Pity and Compaſſion to them, when they are remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably unfortunate themſelves; eſpecially when that Calamity ſeems more particularly to light upon them for their Ability, and Endeavour to conſult the good Fortune of other Folks.</p>
            <p>About the abovementioned Year 1702, <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Campbel</hi> grew a little tired of his Profeſſion. Such a multitude of Followers troubled him, ſeveral of whom were wild Youths and came to banter him, and many more too inquiſitive Females, to teaze him with endleſs Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinences, and who, the more he told them, had ſtill the more to ask, and whoſe Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity was never to be ſatisfied: And beſides this he was ſo much envy'd, and had ſo many
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0180400100:233"/>
malicious Artifices daily practiſed againſt him, that he reſolv'd to leave off his Profeſſion. He had (I know) follow'd it pretty cloſely from the time I firſt ſaw him in <hi>London,</hi> which was I think in the beginning of the Year 1698, till the Year 1702, with very good Succeſs; and in thoſe few Years he had got together a pretty round Summ of Mony. Our young <hi>Seer</hi> was now at Man's Eſtate, and had learn'd the Notion that he was to be his own Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſo far as to be his own Counſellor too in what Road of Life he was to take, and this Conſideration (no doubt) work'd with a <hi>deeper</hi> Impreſſion on <hi>his</hi> Mind, than it uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally does on <hi>others</hi> that are in the ſame <hi>bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming Pride</hi> of Manhood, becauſe it might appear more natural for him to believe, that he had a ſufficient Ability to be his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Adviſer, who had given ſo many others, and ſome more aged than himſelf, Counſel, with very good Succeſs. Now every expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Perſon knows, that when Manhood is yet green, it is ſtill in the ſame dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as a young Plant, which is liable to be warp'd by a Thouſand croſs fortuitous Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, if good Meaſures be not taken to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it againſt all the contingent Shocks it may meet with from the Weather or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Now it was his Misfortune to be made averſe to Buſineſs, which he lov'd before, by having too much of it, and to be ſo ſoured by meeting with numerous Perplexities and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0180400100:234"/>
malicious Rubs laid in his way by invidious People, (who are the uſeleſs and injurious <hi>Buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies,</hi> that always repine at the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and rejoice to do harm to the Diligent and Aſſiduous, though they reap no Profit by it themſelves;) that he was diſguſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd entirely from the Proſecution of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, by which he got not only a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent but a copious and plentiful Subſiſtence. Nay indeed this was another Miſchief ariſing to him from his having ſo much Buſineſs, that he had got Money enough to leave it off, when the Perplexities of it had made him willing to do ſo, and to live very comfortably and handſomely, like a Gentleman without it, for a time; and we know the youngeſt Men are not wont to look the fartheſt before them, in matters that concern their own Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Now inaſmuch as he had thus taken a Diſguſt to Buſineſs and Application, and was ſurfeited (as I may ſay) with the Perplexities of it, it muſt be as natural for him, we know, to ſearch for Repoſe in the contrary extream, <hi>viz.</hi> Recreation and Idleneſs, as it is for a Man to ſeek Reſt after Toil, to ſleep after a Day's Labour, or to ſit down after a long and tireſome Walk. But there are two very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſorts of Idleneſs, and two very different kinds of Recreation; there is a ſhameful Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is no better than down-right Sloth; and there is a ſplendid kind of Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, where a Man having taken an Averſion
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0180400100:235"/>
to the Weariſomeneſs of a Buſineſs which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to him, neglects not however to employ his Thoughts, when they are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant from what they ought more chiefly to be about, in other Matters not entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable in Life, the Exerciſe of which he finds he can follow with more abundant Eaſe and Satisfaction. There are ſome Sorts of Recreations too, that are mean, fordid, and baſe; others, that are very innocent, though very diverting, and that will give one the very next moſt valuable Qualifications of a Gentleman, after thoſe, which are obtained by a more ſerious Application of the Mind. The Idea which I have already given my Readers of our <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> will eaſily make them judge, before I tell them, which way, in theſe two Ways, his <hi>Genius</hi> would naturally lead him; and that, when he grew an idle Man, he would rather indulge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with applying his Mind to the ſhining Trifles of Life, than be wholly ſlothful and unactive; and that when he diverted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he would not do it after a fordid baſe manner, as having a better taſte and a reliſh for good Company; but that his Recreations would ſtill be the Recreations of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And juſt, accordingly, as my Readers would naturally judge before-hand in his Caſe, ſo it really happened. The Moment he ſhook of Buſineſs, and diſmiſs'd the Thoughts of it, his <hi>Genius</hi> led him to a very gallant
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0180400100:236"/>
Way of Life; in his Lodgings, in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in paying and receiving Viſits, in Coffee-houſes, in Taverns, in fencing Schools, in Balls and other publick Aſſemblies, in all ways in fine both at home and abroad, <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Campbell</hi> was a well comported and civil fine Gentleman; he was a Man of Pleaſure, and nothing of the Man of Buſineſs appeared about him. But a Gentleman's Life without a Gentleman's Eſtate, however ſhining and pleaſant it may be for a time, will certainly end in Sorrow if not in Infamy; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Life (as Moraliſts do) to a Day, one may ſafely pronounce this Truth to all the ſplendid Idlers, I have mention'd, that if they have ſunſhiny Weather till Noon, yet the After-noon of their Life will be very ſtormy, rainy and uncomfortable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps juſt at the end of their Journey, to carry on the <hi>Metaphor</hi> throughout, cloſe in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kind of Night. Of this, as I was a Man of Years and more experienc'd in the World than he, I took upon me to forewarn Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> as ſoon as I perceiv'd the firſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fit of this elegant Idleneſs had ſeiz'd him. But when will young Men, by ſo much the more head-ſtrong as they have leſs of the Beard, be guided and brought to learn, and when ſhall we ſee that happy Age, in which the grey Heads of old Men ſhall be clapp'd upon the Shoulders of Youth? I told him, that in this one thing he ought to conſult me,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0180400100:237"/>
and acknowledge me to be a true Prophet, if I told him the end of the ſeeming merry Steps in Life, he was now taking, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly bring him to a Labyrinth of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, out of which if he extricated himſelf at all, he would at leaſt find it a laborious piece of Work. His Taſte had been already vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Sweets which lay at the top of the bitter Draught of Fortune, and my honeſt rugged Counſel came too late to prevail, when his Fancy had decoy'd and debauch'd his Judgement, and carry'd it over into another Intereſt. I remember I writ down to him the moral Story, where vicious Pleaſure and Virtue are pictured by the Philoſopher to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before <hi>Hercules,</hi> to court him into two ſeveral Paths. I told him more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſince he had not an Eſtate to go th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap> with the gentlemanly Life (as he call'd it) that, if he follow'd the alluring Pleaſures, which endeavour'd to tempt <hi>Hercules,</hi> he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve himſelf at laſt in a whole heap of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, out of which it would be more than an <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour for him to diſentangle himſelf again. If he had been a Man that could have ever heard with either, I would have told the Reader in a very familiar Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, that he turn'd the deaf Ear to me; for he did not mind one Syllable nor Tittle of the Preſcriptions I ſet down for him, no more than if he had never read them; but, varying the Phraſe a little, I may ſay at leaſt, when
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0180400100:238"/>
he ſhould have look'd upon my Counſel with all the Eyes he had, he turn'd the blind Side upon it. I was reſolv'd to make uſe of the Revenge natural to a Man of Years, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apply'd that reproachful Proverb to him, which we Ancients delight much in making uſe of to Youths, that follow their own falſe and hot Imaginations, and will not heed the cooler Dictates of Age, Experience, and Wiſdom. Accordingly I wrote down to him theſe Words and left him in a ſeeming Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I am very well aſſured, <hi>young Man,</hi> you <hi>think me,</hi> that am <hi>Old</hi> to be a <hi>Fool;</hi> but <hi>I,</hi> that am <hi>Old,</hi> abſolutely <hi>know you</hi> who are a <hi>young Fellow,</hi> to <hi>be a down-right Fool,</hi> and ſo I leave you to follow your own ways, till ſad and woful Experience teaches you to know it your ownſelf, and makes you come to me to own it of your own accord. As I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away after this tart Admonition and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reprimand, I had a Mind to obſerve his Countenance, and I ſaw him ſmile, which I rightly conſtrued to be done in contempt of the advice of Age, and in the Gaiety and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conceit, which Youth entertains of its own fond Opinions and hair-brain'd raſh Reſolves. He was got into the Company of a very pretty ſet of Gentlemen, whoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes were far ſuperior to his; but he follow'd the ſame genteel Exerciſes, as Fencing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and made one at all their publick Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and ſo being at an equal Expence,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0180400100:239"/>
with thoſe, who could well afford to ſpend, what they did, out of their Eſtates; he went on very pleaſantly for a time, ſtill ſpending and never getting, without ever conſidering, that it muſt, by inevitable conſequence, fall to his Lot at laſt to be entirely reduced to a State of Indigence and Want. And what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly heightens the Misfortune of ſuch Men (and ſo of all Gentlemens younger Brothers,) who live upon the ready Money that is given them for their Portions, is, that the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they live in for a time gains them Credit enough, juſt to bring them in Debt, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more Miſerable, than thoſe very Wratches, who never had either any Money or Credit at all. They run themſelves into Debt out of Shame, and to put off the evil Day of appearing ruin'd Men as long as they can, and then when their Tempers are ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd by Adverſity, they grow tir'd of their own Lives, and then in a Quarrel they or ſome other Gentleman, may be, is run thorough, or elſe being hunted by Bayliffs, they Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Swords upon thoſe Purſuers. Thus where Gentlemen will not conſider their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, their very Proſperity is a Cauſe of, and aggravates their Miſery, their very <hi>Pride</hi> (which was a decent Pride at firſt) in keeping up and maintaining their <hi>Credit,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them too often to the loweſt and the meaneſt Acts, and their Courage, which was of a laudable Kind, turns into a brutiſh and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0180400100:240"/>
ſavage Rage; and all the fine, eſteem'd flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and happy, Gentleman ends, and is loſt in the contemn'd poor and miſerable Deſperado, whoſe Portion at laſt is Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a Goal, and ſometimes even worſe, and what I ſhall not ſo much as name here. Into many of theſe Calamities Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> had brought himſelf, before it was long, by his heedleſneſs, and running, according to the wild Dictates of Youth, counter to all ſound and wholeſome Advice. He had (it ſeems) run himſelf into Debt, and one Day, as he was at a Coffee-houſe the Sign of the Three <hi>Crowns</hi> in great <hi>Queen-ſtreet,</hi> in ruſh'd Four Bayliffs upon him, who being directed by the Creditor's Wife, had watch'd him into that Houſe, and told him they had a Warrant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and upon his not anſwering, they being unacquainted with his being deaf and dumb, offer'd to ſeize his Sword. He ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at their offering of Violence, and taking them for Ruſſians (which he had often met with) repell'd the Aſſaulters, and drawing his Sword, as one Man, more bold than the reſt, cloſed in with him, he ſhorten'd his Blade, and in the Fall pinn'd the Fellow through the Shoulder, and himſelf through the Leg, to the Floor. After that he ſtood at Bay with all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

the Man, for which, as ſhe was a married Woman, Nature methinks ſhould have taught her to have a greater Tenderneſs, and almoſt ſqueez'd and cruſh'd thoſe Vitals to death. But at laſt he got free from them all, and was going away as faſt as he could, not knowing what Conſequences might enſue. But the Woman who aim'd herſelf at committing Murder, in the moſt ſavage and inhuman Manner, ran out after him, crying out Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Murder, as loud as ſhe could, and alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Street. The Bayliff's following the Woman, and being bloody from Head to Foot, by means of the Wound he receiv'd, gave Credit to the Outcry. The late Earl <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>'s Footmen happening to be at the Door ran immediately to ſtop the ſuppos'd Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and they indeed did take him at laſt, but perceiv'd their Miſtake, and diſcovered that inſtead of being Aſſiſtants in taking a Man, whom they thought to be a Murderer endeavouring to make his Eſcape from the Hands of Juſtice, they had only been trick'd in by that falſe Cry to be Adjutants to a Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff in retaking a Gentleman who, by ſo gallant a Defence, had reſcu'd himſelf from the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a Priſon; and when they had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd this their Miſtake they were mighty ſorry for what they had done. The moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and buſy among the Earl's Footmen was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man, and the Earl happening to be in a Room next the Street, and hearing the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0180400100:242"/>
Outcry of Murder, ſtep'd to the Window, and ſeeing his own Servants in the midſt of the Buſtle, examin'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> Man how the Matter was, and, being told it, he chid the Man for being concern'd in ſtopping a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that was getting free from ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Companions. But the <hi>Dutch</hi> Man excuſed himſelf, like a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a very merry Blunder for a Reply. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente,</hi> ſaid he, to his Lord, if I had thought they were Bayliffs, I would have fought for the poor dumb <hi>Gentleman,</hi> but then why had not <hi>he told</hi> me they were Bailiffs my Lord?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> was carry'd off as their Priſoner; but the Bayliff, that was wounded, was led back to the Coffee Houſe where he pretended the Wound was Mortal, and that he deſpair'd of living an Hour. The Proverb however was of the Fellow's Side, and he recover'd ſooner than other People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he could. Aſſoon as all Danger was over, an Action for Damages and ſmart Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (as their Term is) was brought againſt Mr. <hi>Campbell;</hi> the Damages were exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and the Demand was ſo extravagant, that <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> was neither able, juſt at that Time, nor willing, had he been able, to pay ſo much, as he thought, in his own Wrong, and having no Bail, and being aſham'd to make his caſe known to his better ſort of Friends, who were both able and willing to help him at a dead Liſt, he was hurry'd away
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0180400100:243"/>
to Goal by the Bayliffs, who ſhew'd ſuch a malignant and inſolent Pleaſure, as commonly attends powerful Revenge, when they put him into the Marſhalſea. There he lay in Confinement Six Weeks, till at laſt Four or Five of his chief Friends came by mere Chance to hear of it; immediately they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted about his Deliverance and unanimouſly reſolved to contribute for his Enlargement, and they accordingly went croſs the Water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and procured it out of Hand.</p>
            <p>Two of his Benefactors were Officers, and were juſt then going over to <hi>Flanders. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Campbell,</hi> to whom they communicated their Deſign, was reſolved to try his Fortune in a Military Way, out of a roving kind of Humour, raiſed in him partly by his having taken a ſort of Averſion to his own Profeſſion in Town, and partly, by his finding, that he could not live, without following a Profeſſion as he had done, any longer. He over a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle frankly imparted his Mind to them at large; he ſignify'd to them that he hoped, ſince they had lately done him ſo great a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in freeing him from one Captivity, they would not think him too urgent, if he preſs'd for one Favour further, upon Natures ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous as theirs, by whom he took as great a Pleaſure in being obliged, as he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in being capable of obliging others. He wrote to them that the Favour he meant was to redeem him from another Captivity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0180400100:244"/>
as irkſome to him, as that, out of which they had lately ranſom'd him. This Captivity, continued he, is, being either forc'd to follow my old Profeſſion, which I have taken an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Diſguſt to, for a Maintenance, or being forc'd to live in a narrower Way than ſuits with my <hi>Genius,</hi> and the better Taſte I have of higher Life. Such a State, Gentlemen, you know, is more unpalatable than Half-pay; it is like either being forc'd to go upon the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Hope,</hi> or elſe like a Man's being an entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſhier'd and broken Officer, that had no younger Brother's Fortune, and no other Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port but his Commiſſion. Thus though you have ſet my Body at Liberty, my Soul is ſtill under an Impriſonment, and will be till I leave <hi>England,</hi> and can find means of viſiting <hi>Flanders,</hi> which I can do no otherwiſe than by the advantage of having you for my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy. I have a mighty longing to Experience ſome part of a Military Life, and I fancy, if you will grant me your Intereſt, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to the valiant young Lord <hi>Lorne,</hi> and be Spokeſ-men for a dumb Man, I ſhall meet with a favourable Reception, and as for you (Gentlemen) after having named that great Patron and Pattern of Courage and Conduct in the Field, I can't doubt but the very Name I bear, if you had not known me, would have made you taken me for a Perſon of a Military <hi>Genius,</hi> and that I ſhould do nothing but what would become a <hi>Britiſh</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0180400100:245"/>
Souldier, and a Gentleman; nothing in fine, that ſhould make you repent the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>
            <p>Theſe generous and gallant Friends of his, it ſeems, comply'd with his Requeſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd they would make Application for him to the Lord <hi>Lorne,</hi> and <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> had nothing to do but to get his Bag and Baggage ready and provide himſelf with a Paſs. His Baggage was not very long a getting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he had it in tolerable good Order, and as for his Paſs, a Brother of the Lord <hi>Forbes</hi> was ſo kind, as to procure him one, upon the firſt Application <hi>Duncan</hi> made to him.</p>
            <p>Accordingly in a few Days afterwards they went on Board, and having a ſpeedy and an eaſy Paſſage, arrived ſoon at <hi>Rotterdam. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> met with ſome of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in that Town, and his Mind being pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much bent upon rambling, and ſeeing all the Curioſities, Cuſtoms, and Humours, he could, in all the foreign Places he was to paſs thorough; he went out of a Frolick with ſome Gentlemen, next Day, in a Boat to an adjacent Village, to make merry over a home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Dutch</hi> Entertainment, the intended Repaſt being to conſiſt of what the Boors there count a great Delicacy, brown Bread and white Beer. He walk'd out of ſight from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and they loſt one another; and ſtroling about by himſelf at an unſeaſonable Hour, as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0180400100:246"/>
they call it there after the Bell has toll'd, <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> who neither knew their Laws, nor if he had, was capable of being guided by the notice which their Laws ordain, was taken into Cuſtody in the Village for that Night, and carry'd away the next Day to <hi>Williamſtadt,</hi> where he was taken for a Spy, and put into a cloſe Impriſonment for Three or Four Days.</p>
            <p>But ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen, who had been in Company with Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> at Mr. <hi>Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterman</hi>'s a Painter in <hi>Covent-garden,</hi> made their Application to the Magiſtrate and got him releaſs'd: He knew his Friends the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, that carried him over, were gone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Camp, and that there was no Hope of finding them at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> if he ſhould go thither, and ſo he reſolv'd ſince he had had ſo many Days Puniſhment in <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamſtadt,</hi> to have Three or Four Days Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure there too by way of Amends, before he would ſet out on his Journey after his Friends. But on the Third Night he got very much in Drink; and as he went very boiſterouſly and diſorderly along, a Sentry challeng'd him; and the want of the Senſe of Hearing had like to have occaſion'd the Loſs of his Life. The Sentry fir'd at him and narrowly miſs'd him; He was taken Priſoner, not without ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which was ſo far Innocent, as that he knew not any reaſon, why he ſhould be feized: but very troubleſome and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

in ſo orderly a Town; ſo the Governor's Secretary, after the matter was examined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, judging it better for the unhappy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's future Safety, advis'd him to return home to his own Country, and accordingly beſpoke him a Place in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship called <hi>Yowfrow Catherine,</hi> for his Paſſage to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> had taken up this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of rambling firſt, of his own accord, and the Troubles which he had run himſelf into by it, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, had pretty well cur'd him of that extravagant Itch; and there is little doubt to be made, but that he rejoyc'd very heartily, when he was got on Board the Ship to return to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> and that, in his new Reſolutions, he had reconciled himſelf to the Proſecution of his former Profeſſion, and intended to ſet up for a <hi>Predictor</hi> again aſſoon as he could arrive at <hi>London.</hi> But now Fortune had not a Mind to let him go off ſo; he had had his own Fancy for rambling, and now ſhe was reſolv'd to have hers, and to give him his bellyful of Caprice. Accordingly when the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship called <hi>Yowfrow Catherine,</hi> was making the beſt of her Road for <hi>London,</hi> and each Perſon in the Veſſel was making merry, fill'd with the Hopes of a quick and proſperous Paſſage; a <hi>French</hi> Privateer appeared in ſight, crouding all the Sails ſhe could, and bearing towards them with all haſte and diligence. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer was double-mann'd, and carry'd Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

All the Paſſengers, to a ſingle Man, were ſtripp'd, and had <hi>French</hi> Sea-mens Jackets in exchange for their Cloaths. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> had now a Taſte given him of the Fate of War, as well as of the Humour of travelling, and wiſh'd himſelf again, I warrant him, among his greateſt Croud of Conſulters, as tireſome as he thought Buſineſs to be, inſtead of being in the Middle of a Crew of <hi>Sea-Savages.</hi> The Town, where the Dumb-priſoner was at laſt confin'd, was <hi>Denain.</hi> There happened to be ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fryers there, who were told by the others, who he was, and to them he apply'd himſelf in writing, and receiv'd from them a great deal of civil Treatment. But a certain Man of the Order of <hi>Recollects,</hi> happening to ſee him there, who had known him in <hi>England,</hi> and what Profeſſion he followed, cauſed him to be called to Queſtion as a Man that made uſe of ill means to tell Fortunes. When he was queſtion'd by a whole Society of theſe religious Men, he made them ſuch pertinent and ſatisfactory Anſwers in writing, that he convinced them he had done nothing for which he deſerv'd their Reprimand; and they unanimouſly acquitted him. The Heads of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0180400100:249"/>
his Defence, as I have been informed, were theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He alledg'd that the <hi>Second Sight</hi> was in-born and in-bred in ſome Men; and that every Country had had Examples of it more or leſs; but that the Country of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in which he was educated from an Infant, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded the moſt of any with thoſe ſort of People: And from thence he ſaid he thought he might very naturally draw this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that a Faculty that was in-born and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to Men, and grown almoſt a national Faculty among a People, who were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Honeſt, Upright and well-meaning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, could not, without ſome Impiety, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Poſſeſſors of it as a Sin; and when one of the Fathers rejoin'd, that it was remark'd by ſeveral Writers, of the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> that it muſt be therefore <hi>Sinful,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it remain'd no longer among the People when the Doctrines of Chriſtianity were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propagated, and the Light of the Goſpel increaſed among them; and that afterwards it affected none but Perſons of vicious Lives and an ill Character. To this Objection Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> reply'd, that he knew moſt (even ingenious) Writers had made that Remark concerning the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> but beg'd leave to be excuſed, if he ventured to declare, that it was no better than a vulgar and common Error; and the Reaſons were theſe, which he alledg'd in his own behalf, and to confirm his
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0180400100:250"/>
Aſſertion, he told them Men of undoubted Probity, Virtue and Learning, both of <hi>their own Religion,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick) and alſo of <hi>the Reform'd Religion,</hi> and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations had been affected, and continued all their Lives to be affected, with this <hi>Second ſighted</hi> Power, and that there could be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no room to fix upon it the odious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of being a ſinful and vicious (not to ſay that ſome call'd it ſtill worſe, a diabolical) Talent. He ſaid he would content himſelf with making but two Inſtances, becauſe he believ'd thoſe Two would be enough to give Content to them, his Judges too, in that Caſe. In his firſt Inſtance he told them that they might find ſomewhat relating to this in <hi>Nicolaus Hemingius,</hi> who in his Tracts <hi>de Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitionibus Magicis,</hi> printed at <hi>Copenhagen, Anno</hi> 1575, informs the World; that <hi>Petrus Palladius,</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Seelandt,</hi> and Profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> could, from a part of his Body affected, foretel from what part of the Heavens Tempeſts would come, and was ſeldom deceiv'd. One of the Father's immediately ask'd him if he underſtood <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin?</hi>—To this <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> reply'd no. Oh! Said the Fryer then, I don't remember that Book was ever tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> that you mention:—But rejoin'd <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> the Paſſage I mention'd to you, I have read in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book, and Word for Word, according to the beſt of my Memory,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0180400100:251"/>
as I have written it down to you.—In what <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book ſaid the Fryer?—I don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Name of the Book, <hi>Duncan Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> anſwer'd, but very well remember the Paſſages, and that it was in a Book of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and which bore a Credit and good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the World; and you being Scholars, may, if you pleaſe, have recourſe to the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Original, and I doubt not but you'll find, what I ſay, to be a Truth.—For the Second Inſtance, he told them; that, in <hi>Spain,</hi> there are thoſe they call <hi>Saludadores,</hi> that have this kind of Gift. There was (continued he in Writing) one of your own Religion, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fathers, and of a religious Order, nay a Fryer too, that had this Gift: He was a noted <hi>Dominican,</hi> ſaid he, and though I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his Name, you may by writing a Letter to <hi>England</hi> learn his Name. He was a devout <hi>Portugueſe</hi> belonging to Queen <hi>Catherine Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager's</hi> Chappel; and had the <hi>Second Sight</hi> to a great degree, and was famous and eminent for it. They then ask'd him what was the full Power he had to do by the <hi>Second Sight.</hi> He anſwer'd, that as they had intimated, that they had peruſed ſome of the skilful Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the <hi>Second Sight,</hi> he did not doubt but they had found (as well as he could tell them) that as to the Extent of Peoples Knowledge in that ſecret way, it reach'd both preſent, paſt, and future Events. They fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee Murders, Drownings, Weddings, Burials,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0180400100:252"/>
Combats, Manſlaughters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all which there are many Inſtances to be given. They commonly foreſee ſad Events a little while before they happen; for Inſtance, if a Man's fatal End be Hanging, they'll ſee a Gibbet, or Rope about his Neck; if Beheading, they'll ſee a Man without a Head; if Drowning, they'll ſee Water up to his Throat; if Stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, they'll ſee a Dagger in his Breaſt; if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Death in his Bed, they'll ſee a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sheet about his Head: They foretel not only Marriages, but of good Children, what kind of Life Men ſhall lead, and in what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they ſhall die, alſo Riches, Honours, Preferments, Peace, Plenty, and good Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It's likewiſe uſual with Perſons, that have loſt any Thing, to go to ſome of theſe Men, by whom they are directed, how, with what Perſons, and in what Place, they ſhall find their Goods. It is alſo to be noted, that theſe Gifts bear a Latitude, ſo that ſome have it in a far more eminent Degree than others; and what I have here written down to you, you need not take as a Truth from me, but as it concern'd me ſo nearly, I remember the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by heart, and you will find it very near Word for Word, in Dr. <hi>Beaumont</hi>'s Book of <hi>familiar Spirits.</hi> Ay ſaid the Fryers, but you have a <hi>Genius</hi> too that attends you as we are inform'd. So, reply'd <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> have all Perſons, that have the <hi>Second Sight</hi> in any eminent Degree; and to prove this I will
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0180400100:253"/>
bring no leſs a Witneſs than King <hi>James,</hi> who, in his <hi>Demonology,</hi> Book the Third and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Second, mentions alſo a Spirit call'd <hi>Brownie,</hi> that was wont formerly to haunt divers Houſes, without doing any Evil; but doing, as it were, neceſſary turns up and down the Houſe; he appear'd like a rough Man, nay, ſome believ'd, that their Houſe was all the <hi>Sonſier,</hi> as they call'd it, that is, the more lucky, or fortunate, that ſuch Spirits reſorted there. With theſe replies the Fryers began to own they were very well ſatisfy'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſe'd in the Account he had given of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as a very good, true, and honeſt Account: But they told him they had ſtill a further Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt him, and that was that he practis'd Magick Arts, and that he us'd, as they had been inform'd, unlawful Incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To this he made Anſwer, that there were two Kinds of Magick, of which, he knew, they, that were Men of learning, could not be ignorant. The Art Magick, which is Wicked and Impious, continued he, is that which is profeſs'd, and has been profeſs'd at all Times in the World, by <hi>Witches, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Diviners, Inchanters,</hi> and ſuch like no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Profligates, who by having an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Commerce with the Devil, do many ſtrange, prodigious, and preternatural Acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and beyond all humane Wiſdom; and all the Arguments I ever did or ever will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce (continued he) from that black Art, is a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0180400100:254"/>
good and a ſhining Argument: It is this, O Fathers, I draw a Reaſon from theſe prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Practices of <hi>Wizards, Magicians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters, &amp;c.</hi> and from all the Heathen Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition, to prove, that there is a <hi>Deity;</hi> for from theſe Acts of theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preternatural and above humane Wiſdom, we may conſequently infer that they proceed from a ſupernatural and immaterial Cauſe, ſuch as <hi>Demons</hi> are. And this is all the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I ever did or ever will draw from that black helliſh Art. But (Fathers!) there is another Kind of Art Magick call'd natural Magick, which is directly oppoſite to theirs, and the Object of which Art is to do ſpiritual Good to Mankind, as the Object of theirs is to torment them, and induce them to Evil. They afflict People with Torments, and my Art relieves them from the Torments they cauſe. The publick Profeſſion of theſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Arts</hi> has (as you know, Fathers, 'tis a common Diſtinction between <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white</hi> Magick,) been tolerated in ſome of the moſt famous Univerſities of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> though afterwards for a very good Reaſon in <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> making it a publick Study to ſuch a Degree was very wiſely retrench'd by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition. If this therefore be a Fault in your own Opinions, hear my <hi>Accuſers,</hi> but if not you will not only <hi>excuſe</hi> but <hi>commend</hi> me.</p>
            <p>The Fryers were extreamly well pleaſed with his Defence: But one of them had a
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0180400100:255"/>
Mind to frighten him a little if he could, and ask'd him what he would ſay, if he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Witches lately ſeiz'd, that would ſwear he had been frequently at their unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſſemblies, where they were making their waxen Images, and other odd miſchievous Inventions in black Magick, to torment Folks; what if I can produce ſuch Evidence againſt you, wrote the Father to him by way of ſtrengthening the Queſtion, will you not own that we have convicted you then? And when he had wrote the Note he gave it <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> with a Look that ſeem'd to expreſs his Warmth and Earneſtneſs in the Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> took the Paper and read it, and far from being ſtartled, return'd this Anſwer, with a Smile continuing in his Face, while he wrote it. No ſaid he, Fathers, by your leave, they will only prove me a good Magician by that Oath, and themſelves more plainly Witches. They will prove their Love to torment good Folks, and only ſhew their Hatred to me an innocent Man, but wiſe enough to torment 'em by hindering 'em from tormenting others. The Fathers were well pleas'd with the Shrewdneſs of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: But <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> had a mind to exert his Genius a little farther with the good Fryer, who thought likewiſe he had put him a very ſhrew'd Queſtion; ſo taking up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sheet of Paper; Fathers, ſaid he, ſhall I entertain you with a Story of what paſs'd,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0180400100:256"/>
upon this Head, between two religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as you all of you are) and a Prince of <hi>Germany,</hi> in which you will find that mine ought to be reputed a full Anſwer to the Queſtion, the laſt learned Father was pleaſed to propoſe to me? The Story is ſomewhat long, but very much to the purpoſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining: I remember it perfectly by heart, and if you will have Patience while I am writing it, I don't doubt but that I ſhall not only ſatisfy you, but pleaſe you, and oblige you, with the Relation. The Author I found it in quotes it from <hi>Fromannus</hi> (I think the Man's Name was ſo, and I am ſure my Author calls him a very learned Man) in his Third Book of <hi>Magical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation,</hi> and, tho' I don't underſtand the Language the Original is writ in, yet I date venture to ſay upon the Credit of my <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author, from whom I got the Story by heart, that you will find me right, when ever you ſhall be pleaſed to ſearch.</p>
            <p>The Fryers were earneſt for the Story and expreſs'd a deſire that he would write it down for them to read, which he did in the following Words. <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>other extraordinary Qualifications.</hi> The Story is this.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"A <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> invited <hi>two reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fathers,</hi> of <hi>eminent Virtue</hi> and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to a Dinner. The <hi>Prince,</hi> at Table, ſaid to one of them: Father! Think you we do right in hanging Perſons, who are accuſed by Ten or Twelve <hi>Witches,</hi> to have appear'd at their Meetings or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths? <hi>I</hi> ſomewhat <hi>fear</hi> we are <hi>impoſed on</hi> by the <hi>Devil,</hi> and that it is not a <hi>ſofe</hi> Way to <hi>Truth,</hi> that <hi>we walk</hi> in by <hi>theſe Accuſations;</hi> eſpecially, ſince many <hi>great</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> Men <hi>every where</hi> begin to <hi>cry</hi> out <hi>againſt</hi> it, and to charge our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with it: Tell <hi>me</hi> therefore <hi>your Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> To whom the Fathers being ſomewhat of an eager Spirit ſaid: What ſhould make us doubtful in this Caſe? Or what ſhould touch our Conſciences, being convicted by ſo many Teſtimonies? Can we make it a Scruple, whether God will permit inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſons ſhould be ſo traduc'd? There is no Cauſe for a Judge to ſtick at ſuch a Number of Accuſations, but he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with Safety. To which when the <hi>Prince</hi> had reply'd, and much had been ſaid <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> on both Sides about it, and the <hi>Father</hi> ſeem'd wholly to carry the Point, the <hi>Prince</hi> at length concluded the Diſpute; ſaying, I am ſorry for you, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that in a <hi>Capital Cauſe</hi> you have <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0180400100:258"/>

            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> had wrote down the Story; the Fathers peruſed it, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mightily entertain'd with it. It put an end to all further Queſtions, and the Man, whom they had been trying for a Conjurer, they joined in deſiring, upon diſtinct Pieces of Paper, under their ſeveral Hands, to come frequently and viſit them, as being not only a harmleſs and innocent, but an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary well-meaning good and diverting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. They treated him for ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards during his Stay, with the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip due to a Country-man, with the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that is owing to a Gentleman, and with the Aſſiſiance and Support, which beloag'd to a Perſon of Merit in Diſtreſs. Money they had none themſelves it ſeems to give him, being <hi>Menditants,</hi> by their own Proſeſſion; but they had Intereſt enough to get him quite free from being Priſoner; he participated of their <hi>Elemoſinary Table,</hi> had a <hi>Cell</hi> allow'd him
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0180400100:259"/>
among them in what they call their <hi>Dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;</hi> he had an odd Coat and a pair of Trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers made out of ſome of their brown coarſe Habits, by the poor unfaſhionable Taylor or <hi>Botcher</hi> belonging to the Convent, and at laſt they found means of recommending him to a Maſter of a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel, that was ready to ſet Sail, to give him a caſt over the Channel to <hi>England;</hi> and to provide him with the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of Life, till he got to the Port. This <hi>French</hi> Veſſel was luckier than the <hi>Dutch one</hi> had been before to our dumb Gentleman, it had a quick and proſperous Paſſage, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> and as ſoon as he landed there, he having experienc'd the Misfortunes and Caſualties, that a Man in his Condition wanting both Speech and hearing was liable to, in Places where he was an utter Stranger to every Body, reſolv'd to make no Stay but move on as faſt as he could towards <hi>London.</hi> When he came to <hi>Hampton Town,</hi> conſidering the indifferent Figure he made, in thoſe odd kind of Cloaths, which the poor Fryers had equipp'd him with, and that his long Beard and an uncomb'd Wigg added much to the Diſguiſe; he was reſolved to put on the beſt Face, he could, in thoſe aukward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ſtepp'd into the firſt Barber's Shop he came at to be trimm'd and get his Wigg comb'd and powder'd. This proved a very lucky Thought to him; for as ſoon as he ſtepp'd into the firſt Barber's Shop, who
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0180400100:260"/>
ſhould prove to be the Maſter of it, but one <hi>Tobit Yeats,</hi> who had ſerved him in the ſame Capacity at <hi>London,</hi> and was but newly ſet up in the Trade of a Barber-Surgeon at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Town,</hi> and followed likewiſe the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of School-maſter. This <hi>Tobit Yeates</hi> had ſhaved him quite, before he knew him in that Diſguiſe; and Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> though he knew him preſently, had a mind to try if he ſhould be known himſelf firſt: At length the Barber finding him to be a dumb Man by his ordering every thing with Motions of the Hand, and Geſtures of the Body, look'd at him very earneſtly, remember'd him, and in a great Surprize, called for Pen, Ink and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and begg'd to know how he came to be in that Diſguiſe; whether he was under any Misfortune, and Apprehenſion of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, that made him go in ſo poor and ſo clowniſh a Habit, and tender'd him any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, as far as his little Capacity would reach, and deſir'd him to be free, and command him; if he was able to aſſiſt him in any thing. Theſe were the moſt comfortable Words, that <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> had read a great while. He took the Pen and Paper in his turn; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him his whole Story, gave the poor Barber thanks for his good natured Offer, and ſaid he would make ſo much uſe of it, as to be indebted to him for ſo much Money as would pay the Stage Coach, and bear him in his travelling Expences up to <hi>London,</hi> from
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0180400100:261"/>
whence he would ſpeedily return the Favour with Intereſt. The poor honeſt Fellow, out of Gratitude to a Maſter, whoſe Liberality he had formerly experienc'd, immediately furniſh'd Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> with that little Supply, expreſſing the Gladneſs of his Heart that it lay in his Power; and the Stage Coach being to ſet out within but a few Hours, he ran inſtantly to the Inn to ſee if he could get him a Place. By good luck there was Room, and but juſt Room for one more, which pleas'd <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> mightily when he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it by his true and truſty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the Barber; for he was as impatient to ſee <hi>London</hi> again, it ſeems, as he had been before to quit it. Well, he had his Wiſh; and when he came to <hi>London,</hi> he had one Wiſh more for Fortune to beſtow upon him, which appear'd to begin to grow kind again, after her fickle Fit of Cruelty was over; and this Wiſh was, that he might find his former Lodgings empty, and live in the ſame Houſe, as he did, when he follow'd his Proſeſſion. This too ſucceeded according to his Deſire, and he was happily fix'd once more to his Heart's Content in his old Reſidence, with the ſame People of the Houſe round about him, who bore him all that Reſpect and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (and ſhew'd all that Readineſs and Willingneſs to ſerve him on every Occaſion and at every turn) which could be expected from Perſons, that let Lodgings in Town to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0180400100:262"/>
a Gentleman, whom they eſteem'd the beſt Tenant they ever had in their Lives or ever could have.</p>
            <p>Immediately the Tidings of the dumb Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's being return'd home from beyond Sea, ſpread throughout all the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and it was nois'd about from one Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood to another, till it went through all Ranks and Conditions, and was known as well in a Day or Two's Time, all the Town over, as if he had been ſome great Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the State, and his Arrival had been notified to the Publick in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> as a Perſon of the laſt Importance. And ſuch a Perſon he appear'd indeed to be taken for, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially among the fair Sex, who throng'd to his Doors, Croud after Croud, to conſult with him, about their future Occurrences in Life.</p>
            <p>Theſe curious Tribes of People, were as various in their Perſons, Sex, Age, Quality, Profeſſion, Art, Trade, as they were in the Curioſity of their Minds, and the Queſtions they had intended to propound to this <hi>dumb Predictor</hi> of ſtrange Events, that lay yet as Embrio's in the Womb of Time, and were not to come, ſome of them, to a Maturity for Birth, for very many Years after, juſt as por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celain Clay is ſtored up in the Earth by good Artificers, which their Heirs make <hi>China</hi> of half a Century, and ſometimes more than an Age, afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0180400100:263"/>
Theſe Shoals of Cuſtomers, who were to fee him well for his Advice as we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, now he ſtood in need of raiſing a freſh Stock, were unqueſtionably, as welcome and acceptable to him, as they appeared too troubleſome to him before, when he was in a State of more Wealth and Plenty.</p>
            <p>Fortune, that does nothing moderately, ſeem'd now reſolv'd, as ſhe had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly cruel before, to be extreamly kind to him. He had nothing to do from early in the Morning till late at Night, but to read Queſtions, and reſolve them as faſt, as much frequented Doctors write their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions and Recipe's, and like them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to receive Fees as faſt. Fortune was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mightily indulgent to the Wants ſhe had ſo ſuddenly reduc'd him to, and reliev'd him as ſuddenly by theſe <hi>Knots</hi> of <hi>Curioſo's,</hi> who brought him a Glut of Money. But one ſingle fair Lady, that was one of his very firſt Conſulters after his Return, and who had receiv'd ſatisfactory Anſwers from him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Points, before he went abroad; prov'd (ſo good Fortune would have it) worth all the reſt of his Cuſtomers together, as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as they were, and as I have accordingly repreſented them.</p>
            <p>This Lady was the Relict or Widow of a Gentleman of a good Eſtate, and of a very good Family, whoſe Name was <hi>Digby,</hi> and a handſome Jointure ſhe had out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. This Lady, it ſeems, having been with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0180400100:264"/>
him in former Days, and ſeen him in a more ſhining Way of Life, (for he had taken a Humour to appear before all his Company in that coarſe odd Dreſs, made out of the Fryer's Habit, and would not be perſwaded by the People of the Houſe to put on a Nightgown, till he could provide himſelf with a new Suit) was ſo curious, among other Queſtions, as to ask him, whether he had met with any Misfortunes, and how he came to be in ſo ſlovenly and wretched a Habit? Here Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> related the whole Story of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels to her, and the Croſſes and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had met with abroad. The Tears, he obſerv'd, would ſtart every now and then into her Eyes, when ſhe came to any doleful Paſſage, and ſhe appear'd to have a mighty compaſſionate kind of feeling, when ſhe read of any Hardſhip more than ordinarily me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, that had befallen him. Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> it is certain, had then a very good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and was a handſome and portly young Man; and, as a great many young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men derive the ſeeming Agreeableneſs of their Perſons from the Taylor and Perruque-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, the Shoe-maker and Hoſier, ſo Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>'s Perſon on the other Hand gave a good Air and a good Look to the aukward Garb he had on; and I believe, it was from ſeeing him in this odd Trim (as they call it,) the Ladies firſt took up the humour of calling him <hi>the handſome Sloven:</hi> Add to this that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0180400100:265"/>
he look'd his Misfortune in the Face with a jolly Countenance, and ſmiled even while he was penning the Relation of his Calamities: All which are certainly Circumſtances that firſt ſooth a generous Mind into a State of Compaſſion, and afterwards heighten it in the Breaſt wherein it is conceiv'd. Hence it came that this pretty and good natur'd Widow, Mrs. <hi>Digby,</hi> when ſhe had expreſs'd her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration of him by her Looks, began to take the Pen and expreſs it in very tender Terms: Neither did ſhe think that Expreſſion in Words a ſufficient Teſtimony of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion ſhe bore to him; the Generoſity of her Mind did lead her to expreſs it in a more ſubſtantial manner ſtill, and that was to ſhew it plainly by a very benevolous Action. She laid a Purſe of Twenty Guineas before the Table, and at the ſame time ſmiling, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Table, as ſignifying her deſire that he would accept it, and running to the Door drop'd a Curteſy, and skuttled away; and by the ſame civil Act as ſhe oblig'd him, ſhe put it out of his Power to refuſe being ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged; ſo that, though the Preſent was very handſome, the manner of giving it was ſtill handſomer. If being a handſome young Man of Merit in Diſtreſs, and bearing his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes with an equal Mind, are powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to excite Compaſſion in the Mind of a generous Lady, ſo the Generoſity of a young agreeable Widow expreſs'd in ſo kind and ſo
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0180400100:266"/>
benevolous a Way, to a young Gentleman, when he had been taſting nothing but the bitter Draughts of Fortune before, muſt ſtir up an Affection in a Mind that had any ſenſe of Gratitude: And truly juſt ſuch was the Effect that this Lady's Civility had upon Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell.</hi> He conceiv'd, from that Moment, a very great Affection for her; and reſolv'd to try whether he could gain her, which he had no ſmall Grounds to hope, from the Eſteem, which ſhe appear'd to bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him already. I remember Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> makes a very beautiful Obſervation of the near Alliance there is between the Two Paſſions of Pity and Love in a Woman's Breaſt, in one of his Plays. His Words are theſe: <hi>For Pity ſtill fore-runs approaching Love As Light'ning does the Thunder.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bruyere</hi> a moſt ingenious Member of the <hi>French</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy has made another Remark, which comes home to our preſent purpoſe. He ſays, <hi>That many Women love their Money better than their Friends; but yet value their Lovers more than their Money.</hi> According to the Two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of theſe fine Writers upon the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Fair, Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> had hopes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ground his Courtſhip upon; and it appeared ſo in the End by his proving Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful: She from being a very liberal and friendly Client, became at laſt a moſt Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate Wife. He then began to be a Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, and accordingly took a little neat one,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0180400100:267"/>
and very commodious for his Profeſſion, in <hi>Monmouth</hi> Court. Here I muſt take leave to make this Obſervation; That, if Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> inherited the Talents of his ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted Mother, he ſeem'd likewiſe to be an Heir to his Father Mr. <hi>Archibald Campbell,</hi> both in his ſtrange and accidental Sufferings by Sea, and likewiſe in his being reliev'd from them, after as accidental and ſtrange a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by an unexpected Marriage, juſt like his Father's. And here we return again to take a new Survey of him in the courſe of his publick Practice as a Predictor. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts I ſhall give of his Actions here, will be very various in their Nature from any I have yet preſented to the Reader; they are more myſterious in themſelves, and yet I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make the manner of his operating in this kind as plain as (I think) I have the foregoing ones, and then I flatter my ſelf they muſt afford a freſh Entertainment for every Reader, that has any curioſity and a good taſte for things of ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a Kind. For what I have all along pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to myſelf from the beginning, and in the progreſs to the end of this Hiſtory, is, to interweave entertaining and ſurpriſing Narratives of what Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> has done, with curious and inſtructive Enquiries into the nature of thoſe Actions, for which he has rendred himſelf ſo ſingularly famous. It was not therefore ſuitable to my purpoſe, to clog
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0180400100:268"/>
the Reader with numerous Adventures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all of the ſame Kind, but out of a vaſt number of them to ſingle ſome few of thoſe that were moſt remarkable, and that were Myſteries, but Myſteries of very different ſorts. I leave that Method of ſwelling diſtorted and commented Trifles into Volumes, to the writers of Fable and Romance; if I was to tell his Adventures with regard, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to Women that came to conſult him, I might perhaps have not only written the Stories of eleven thouſand Virgins that died Maids, but have had Relations to give of as many marry'd Women and Widows, and the Work would have been endleſs. All that I ſhall do therefore is to pick out one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular each of a different Kind, that there may be variety in the Entertainment. Upon Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to this Dumb Man, one is told in the middle of her Health, that ſhe ſhall die at ſuch a time; another, that ſhe ſhall ſicken, and upon the moment of her recovery, have a Suiter and a Husband; a Third, who is a celebrated Beauty with a multitude of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers round about her, that ſhe ſhall never become a Wife; a Fourth that is marry'd, when ſhe ſhall get rid of an uneaſy Husband; a Fifth that hath loſt her Goods, who ſtole them, where and when they ſhall be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; a Sixth, that is a Merchant, when he ſhall be Undone, and how and when he ſhall recover his Loſſes, and be as great on
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0180400100:269"/>
the <hi>Exchange</hi> as ever; a ſeventh, that is a Gameſter, which will be his winning and which his loſing Hour; an eighth, how he ſhall be involv'd in a Law-ſuit, and whether the Suit will have an adverſe or a proſperous Iſſue; a ninth, that is a Woman, with choice of Lovers, which ſhe ſhall be moſt happy with for Life; and ſo on to many others, where every Prediction is perfectly new and ſurprizing, and differs from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in almoſt every Circumſtance. When a Man has ſo extenſive a Genius as this at foretelling the future Occurrences of Life, one Narrative of a ſort is enough in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to preſent the Reader with, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of each kind would not methinks be entertaining, but tireſome; for he that can do one thing in theſe kinds by the power of Prediction, can do ten thouſand; and thoſe who are obſtinate in extenuating his Talents, and calling his Capacity in queſtion, and that will not be convinc'd by one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Judgment, would not own the conviction if ten thouſand Inſtances were given them. The beſt Paſſages I can recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to their Peruſal, are thoſe, where Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who came purpoſely to banter him under the colour of conſulting him, and cover'd over their ſly Intentions with bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd Diſguiſes, and came in Maſquerades, found all the Jeſt turn'd upon themſelves in the End, which they meant to our famous
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0180400100:270"/>
Predictor, and had the diſcouragement of ſeeing their moſt conceal'd and deepeſt laid Plots diſcovered, and all their moſt witty Fetches and wily Contrivances defeated, till they were compelled univerſally to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that endeavouring to impoſe upon the Judgment of our <hi>Seer,</hi> by any hidden Artifice and Cunning whatſoever, was effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually impoſing upon their own. His unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Talent in this kind was ſo openly known, and ſo generally confeſs'd, that his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was celebrated in ſome of the moſt witty Weekly Papers that ever appear'd in Publick. <hi>Iſaac Bickerſtaff,</hi> who diverted all the <hi>Beaumond</hi> for a long ſpace of time with his Lucubrations, takes occaſion in ſeveral of his Papers, to applaud the Speculations of this dumb Gentleman in an admirable vein of Pleaſantry and Humour, peculiar to the Writer, and to the Subject he writ upon. And when that bright Author, who join'd the uttermoſt Facetiouſneſs with the moſt ſolid Improvements of Morality and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Works, laid aſide the Title of a <hi>Tatler,</hi> and aſſumed the Name of a <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> and Cenſor of Men's Actions, he ſtill every now and then thought our <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> a Subject worthy enough to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his farther Conſiderations upon. I muſt take notice of one Letter ſent concerning him to the <hi>Spectator,</hi> in the Year, 1712, which was at a time when a Lady wanted
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0180400100:271"/>

            <p>But now let us come to thoſe Paſſages of his Life the moſt ſurprizing of all, during the time that he enjoy'd this Reputation, and when he prov'd that he deſerved the Fame he enjoy'd. Let us take a Survey of him while he is wonderfully curing Perſons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under the misfortune of Witchcraft, of which the following Story will be an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Inſtance, and likewiſe clear up how he came by his Reputation in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the above-mentioned Letter to the <hi>Spectator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1709, <hi>Suſanna Johnſon,</hi> Daughter to one Captain <hi>Johnſon,</hi> who liv'd at a place adjacent to <hi>Rumford</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> going one Morning to that Town to buy Butter at the Market, was met there by an old miſerable-looking Woman, juſt as ſhe had taken ſome of her Change of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketwoman
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0180400100:274"/>
in Copper, and this old Woman rather demanded than begg'd the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman to give her a Penny. Mrs. <hi>Johnſon</hi> reputing her to be one of thoſe hateful People that are call'd ſturdy Beggars, refuſed it her, as thinking it to be no act of Charity, and that it would be rather gratifying and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her Impudence, than ſupplying or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying her Indigence. Upon the refuſal, the old Hag with a Face more wrinkl'd ſtill, if poſſible, by Anger, than it was by Age, took upon her to ſtorm at young Mrs. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> very loudly, and to threaten and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace her: But when ſhe found her common Threats and Menaces were of no avail, ſhe ſwore ſhe would be reveng'd of the young Creature in ſo ſignal a manner, that ſhe ſhould repent the Denial of that Penny from her Heart before ſhe got home, and that it ſhould coſt her many Pounds to get rid of the Conſequences of that Denial and her Anger. The poor innocent Girl deſpiſed theſe laſt words likewiſe, and getting up on Horſeback, return'd Homewards; But juſt as ſhe got about half way her Horſe ſtop'd, and no means that ſhe could uſe would make him advance one ſingle ſtep; but ſhe ſtaid a while to ſee if that would humour him to go on. At laſt the Beaſt began to grow unruly, and ſnorted and trembled as if he had ſeen or ſmelt ſomething that frighted him, and ſo fell a kicking deſperately till he threw
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0180400100:275"/>
the Girl from the Saddle, not being able to cling to it any longer, tho' a pretty good Horſewoman of her Years; ſo much were the Horſe's Motions and Plungings more than ordinarily violent.</p>
            <p>As Providence would have it, ſhe got not much harm by the Fall, receiving only a little Bruiſe in the right Shoulder; but ſhe was dreadfully frighted. This Fear added Wings to her Feet, and brought her home as ſpeedily of herſelf as ſhe uſually came on Horſeback. She immediately, without any other ſign of Illneſs than the pallid Colour with which Fear had diſorder'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of her Face, alarm'd all the Family at home with the Story, took her Bed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, complain'd of inward Rackings of the Belly, and was never at caſe unleſs ſhe lay doubled up together her Head to her Knees, and her Heels to her Rump, juſt like a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of 8. She could not be a ſingle Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of that Poſture without ſhrieking out with the violence of anxious Torments and racking Pains.</p>
            <p>In this condition of Miſery, amidſt this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony of Suffering, and in this double Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, was the poor wretched young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman brought to Town; Phyſicians were conſulted about her, but in vain; ſhe was carry'd to different Hoſpitals for aſſiſtance, but their Endeavours likewiſe prov'd ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: At laſt ſhe was conducted to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0180400100:276"/>
of Phyſicians; and even the collective Wiſdom of the greateſt Sages and Adepts in the Science of Phyſick was pos'd to give her any Preſcription that would do her ſervice, and relieve her from the inexplicable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady ſhe labour'd under. The poor incurable Creature was one conſtant Subject of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining Mother's Diſcourſe in every Company ſhe came into. It hapned at laſt, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially truly, that the Mother was thus condoling the Misfortune of her Child among five or ſix Ladies, and telling them among other things, that by the moſt skilful Perſons ſhe was look'd upon to be bewitch'd, and that 'twas not within the power of Phyſick to compaſs her Recovery: They all having been acquainted with our Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> unanimouſly adviſed her to carry her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Houſe and conſult with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her. The Mother was overjoy'd at theſe tidings, and purpoſed to let no time ſlip where her Child's Health was ſo deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. She got the Ladies to go with her and her Child, to be Eye-witneſſes of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a piece of Practice, and ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a trial of Skill.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as this diſmal Object was brought into his Room, Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> lifted up her Head and look'd earneſtly in her Face, and in leſs than a Minute's time ſignify'd to the Company, that ſhe was not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd, but in as dreadful a Condition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0180400100:277"/>
as the Man that had a Legion of Fiends within him.</p>
            <p>At the reading of theſe words the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Creature rais'd up her Head, turn'd her Eyes upwards, and a Smile (a thing ſhe had been a ſtranger to for many Months) overſpread her whole Face, and ſuch a kind of Colour as is the fluſhing of Joy and Gladneſs, and with an innocent tone of Voice ſhe ſaid, ſhe <hi>now had a firm belief ſhe ſhould ſhortly be deliver'd.</hi> The Mother and the reſt of the Company were all in Tears, but Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> wrote to them that they ſhould be of good Heart, be eaſy and quiet for a few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and they ſhould be convinc'd that it was Witchcraft, but happily convinc'd by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſo ſuddenly well again. This brought the Company into pretty good Temper; and a little after, Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> deſir'd ſhe might be led up Stairs into his Chamber and left there alone with him for a little while; this occaſioned ſome ſmall Female Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as much Mirth as their late Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, alleviated with the hopes of her Cure, would permit.</p>
            <p>This you may be ſure was but a ſnatch of Mirth, juſt as the nature of the thing would allow of; and all ſorts of Waggery being laid inſtantly aſide, and remov'd almoſt as ſoon as conceiv'd, the poor young thing was carry'd in that double Poſture up Stairs. She had not been much above half an Hour there,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0180400100:278"/>
when by the help only of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Arm ſhe was led down Stairs, and deſcended into that Room full of Company as a Miracle appearing in a Machine from above; ſhe was led backward and forward in the Room, while all gaz'd at her for a while with joyful Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for no Arrow was ever more ſtrait than ſhe. Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> then prevail'd with her to drink a glaſs of Wine, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after ſhe evacuated Wind, which ſhe had not done for ſome Months before, and found herſelf ſtill more amended and eaſy: And then the Mother making Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> ſome ſmall Acknowledgment at that time, with the promiſe of more, and her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giving Thanks, and all the Company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his Skill, took their Leaves and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with great demonſtrations of Joy. I ſhall here, to cut the Story ſhort, ſignify, that ſhe came frequently afterwards to make her Teſtimonials of Gratitude to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to enjoy her Health to this very Day at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where ſhe now lives, and will at any time, if call'd upon, make Oath of the Truth of this little Hiſtory, as ſhe told me herſelf with her own Mouth.</p>
            <p>The next thing therefore it behoves me to do in this Chapter is, to give ſome ſatisfactory account of Magick, by which ſuch ſeeming myſterious Cures and Operations are brought about.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0180400100:279"/>
This Task I would perform in the moſt perſpicuous and moſt convincing manner I can; for Magick I know is held to be a very hard and difficult Study by thoſe Learned, and univerſally unlawful and diabolical by thoſe Unlearned, who believe there is ſuch a Science attainable by Human Genius. On the other hand, by ſome Learned Men, who believe there is no ſuch Science, it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as an inconſiſtent Syſtem of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Chimera's; and again laugh'd at as ſuch by the Unlearned, who are of an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Temper: What I would therefore undertake to do in this place, is to ſhew the Learned Men, who believe there is ſuch an Art, that the attainment to a tolerable Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the manner how magical Practices may be brought about, is no ſuch difficult Matter as they have repreſented it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and by doing this, I ſhall make the Syſtem of it <hi>ſo plain,</hi> that while the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed approve of it, the Unlearned too, who are not of an unbelieving Kind, may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand clearly what I ſay; and the Learned Men who have rejected this Science as <hi>chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical,</hi> may be clearly convinced it is <hi>real;</hi> and then there is nothing left but obſtinate unbelieving Ignorance, which I ſhall not here pretend by Arguments to lead into Senſe, but leave it to the work of Time. In fine, I will endeavour to induce Men of Senſe to ſay, that, what has been accounted myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

is deliver'd in a plain, eaſy, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing manner, and to own that they approve, while Men of the lower Claſs of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhall confeſs and acknowledge that they themſelves underſtand it, and that what has hitherto been repreſented as arduous and difficult to a great Genius, is adapted and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd not only clear, but familiar to Perſons of midling Talents. In this Work therefore I ſhall follow the ſtricteſt Order I can (which of all things render a Diſcourſe upon any Subject the moſt clear;) and that it may be plain to the commoneſt Capacity, I will firſt ſet down what Order I intend to follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will ſpeak of Magick in general.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of Magick under its ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Subdiviſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Concerning the Object of Art, as it is Good or Bad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Of the Perſons exerciſing that Art in either Capacity of Good or Bad, and by what means they become capacitated to exerciſe it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Fifth</hi> place, I ſhall come to the ſeveral Objections againſt the Art of Magick, and the Refutation of thoſe Objections.</p>
            <p>The firſt Objection ſhall be againſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of good and bad Spirits. The Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of which will conſiſt in my proving the Exiſtences of Spirits both Good and Bad, by Reaſon, and by Experience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0180400100:281"/>
The ſecond Objection that will be brought, is to contain an Allegation that there are no ſuch Perſons as Witches now, and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to ſupport that Allegation, drawn from the Incapacity and Impoſſibility of any thing's making (while itſelf is incarnate) a Contract with a Spirit. This Objection will be anſwer'd by proving the reality of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from almoſt Univerſal Experience, and by explaining rationally the manner how the Devils hold Commerce with Witches; which Explication is back'd and authoriz'd by the Opinion of the moſt Eminent Divines and the moſt Learned Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>From hence, <hi>Sixthly</hi> and laſtly, We ſhall conclude on the ſide of the good Magick, that as there are Witches on the one hand that may afflict and torment Perſons with Daemons, ſo on the other hand there are lawful and good Magicians that may caſt out Daemons from People that are poſſeſs'd with them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt</hi> as to <hi>Magick</hi> in general; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> conſiſts in the Spirit by Faith, for Faith is that MAGNET of the Magicians by which they draw Spirits to them, and by which Spirits they do great things, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like Miracles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Magick</hi> is divided into three ſorts, viz. <hi>Divine, Natural,</hi> and <hi>Diabolical.</hi> And Natural <hi>Magick</hi> is again ſub-divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two kinds, Simple and Compound: And Natural Compound <hi>Magick</hi> is again likewiſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0180400100:282"/>
divided into two Kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Natural-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Magick,</hi> and Natural-diabolical <hi>Magick.</hi> Now, to give the Reader a clear, and a diſtinct Notion of each ſeveral Species of <hi>Magick</hi> here mentioned, I ſet down the following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions.—Divine <hi>Magick</hi> is a Celeſtial Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in which all Operations, that are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully brought about, are performed by the Spirit of God.—Natural <hi>Magick</hi> is a Science, in which all the myſterious Acts that are wrought, are compaſs'd by Natural Spirits.—But as this Natural <hi>Magick</hi> may be exerciſed about things either in a manner indifferent in themſelves, or mere morally Good, and then it is mere natural <hi>Magick;</hi> or elſe about things Theologically good, and tranſcendently bad; and then it is not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Natural <hi>Magick,</hi> but Mix'd and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. If Natural <hi>Magick</hi> be exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the moſt holy Operations, it is then mix'd with the Divine, and may then be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not improperly, Natural-divine Magick. But if Natural <hi>Magick</hi> troubles itſelf about compaſſing the wickedeſt Practices, then is it promiſcuous with the <hi>Demoniacal,</hi> and may not improperly be called Natural dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical <hi>Magick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Object of this Art is doing Wonders out of the ordinary appearing courſe of Nature, which tend either to great good or bad, by the help and Mediation of Spirits good and bad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0180400100:283"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to the Perſons exerciſing that Art in either way, whether good or bad, and by what Means they become capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to act it, the Notion of this may be eaſily deduced from the Notions of the Art itſelf, as conſidered above in its each diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Species; for as all Magick conſiſts in a Spirit, every Magician acts by a Spirit.</p>
            <p>Divine Magicians that are of God are ſpoke of in the ſacred Book, and therefore I ſhall not mention the Paſſages here, but paſs them over (as ought in a Book like this) with a profound and reverential Silence, as well as the other Paſſages, which ſpeak of Natural and Daemoniacal Magicians; and in all I ſhall ſpeak of them in this Place, I ſhall only ſpeak of them with Regard to humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Experience, and conclude this Head with ſaying, that <hi>Natural Magicians work all Things by the Natural Spirits of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> but that <hi>Witches and Daemoniacal Magicians,</hi> as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambers</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> were, <hi>work their magical Performances by the Spirit of Daemons,</hi> and 'tis by the Means of theſe <hi>different Spirits</hi> that theſe <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Magicians</hi> perform their <hi>different</hi> Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things thus diſtinctly ſettled and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, 'tis now we muſt come and ground the Diſpute, between thoſe who believe there are no ſuch Things as <hi>Magicians</hi> of any Kind,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0180400100:284"/>
and thoſe who aſſert there are of all the Kinds above ſpecify'd.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who contend there are, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Experience, and relate many well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs'd Narratives, to prove, that there have been in all Times, and that there are ſtill Magicians of all theſe Kinds: But thoſe, who contend that there are no ſuch Perſons, will give no ear to what the others call plain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; they call the Stories (let whatever Witneſſes appear to juſtify them) either fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Legends invented by the Authors, or elſe Tricks of intellectual <hi>Logerdemain</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Actors, upon the Relators of thoſe Actions. Since therefore (they ſay) tho' the Believers in Magick bragg of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience never ſo much, it may be but a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Experience; they reaſonably deſire to know, whether theſe Gentlemen that ſtand for Magick can anſwer the Objections which they propoſe, to prove, that the Practice of Magick, according to the Syſtem laid down, is inconſiſtent with Reaſon, before they will yield their Aſſent. Let the Stories be never ſo numerous, appear neverſo credible, theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Gentlemen deſire to be try'd by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and aver till that Reaſon is given; they will not be convinc'd by the <hi>Number</hi> of Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, becauſe, tho' numerous, they are Stories ſtill, neither will they believe them becauſe they appear credible; becauſe ſeeming ſo is
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0180400100:285"/>
not being ſo, and Appearances, tho' never ſo fair, when they contradict Reaſon, are not to be ſwallowed down with an implicit Faith as ſo many Realities. And thus far, no doubt, the Gentlemen, who are on the unbelieving Side, are very much in the right on't. The learned Gentlemen on the other hand, who are perſuaded of this mighty myſterious Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, being lodged in the Hands of Magicians, anſwer, that they will take upon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the moſt ſubtle Objections brought by the learned Unbelievers, and to reconcile the Practicability of magical Myſteries by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Men, who ſtudy that Art, to <hi>right Rules</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of Reaſoning, and to ſhew, that ſome Stories (tho' never ſo prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) which are told of Magicians, demand the Belief of wiſe Men on two Accounts; becauſe as Experience backs Reaſon on the one hand, Reaſon backs Experience on the other, and ſo the Iſſue of the whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (whether there are Magicians or not) is thrown upon both Experience and Reaſon. Theſe Arguments on each ſide, I ſhall draw up fairly <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> for I don't pretend to be the Inventor of them my ſelf, they belong to other Authors many Years ago; be it enough for me to boaſt of, if I can draw them up in a better and cloſer Form together, than they have yet appeared in: In that I take upon my ſelf a very great Task; I erect my ſelf as it were into a kind of a <hi>Judge;</hi> I will ſum up the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0180400100:286"/>
Evidences on both ſides, and I ſhall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſee Occaſion, intimate which ſide of the Argument bears the moſt Weight with me; but when I have enforced my Opinion as far as I think needful, my Readers like a Jury are ſtill at Liberty to bring in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, juſt as they themſelves ſhall ſee fit; and this naturally leads me, where I promiſed to come to in the fifth Part of this Diſcourſe, to the ſeveral Objections againſt the Power of Art Magick, and the Refutation of thoſe Objections.</p>
            <div type="objections">
               <head>The firſt Objections being againſt the Exiſtence of Spirits, and the Refutations thereof.</head>
               <p>THE firſt Objection, which they who reject Magick make uſe of, is, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there are any ſuch Things as Spirits about which, ſince thoſe, who defend the Art, ſay it intirely exerciſeth itſelf, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors contend, that if they can make out that there are no ſuch Beings as Spirits, all Pretenſions to the Art muſt be intirely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and for the future exploded.</p>
               <p>To make this Part out, that there are no Spirits, the firſt Man they produce on their Side is undoubtedly one of very great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Authority, inaſmuch as he has juſtly born for many Centuries the Title of a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0180400100:287"/>
Prince of Philoſophers. They ſay, that <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> in his Book <hi>de Mundo,</hi> reaſons thus againſt the Exiſtence of Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſince God can do all Things of himſelf, he doth not ſtand in Need of miniſtring Angels and Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. A Multitude of Servants ſhewing the Weakneſs of a Prince.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen, who defend, the Science make this Reply, they allow the Credit and Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> as much as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors: But as the Objectors themſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all the Authorities for the Spirits, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that Reaſon may be the only Ground they go upon; ſo the Refuters, on their Parts, deſire, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> may not be abſolutely paſs'd upon them for Argument, but that his Words may be brought to the ſame Touchſtone of Reaſon, and proved if they are Standard. If this Argument, ſay they, will hold good, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhould not ſuppoſe Intelligencies moving the Caeleſtial Spheres; for God ſufficeth to move all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miniſtring Spirits; nor would there be Need of a Sun in the World, for God can enlighten all Things by himſelf, and ſo all ſecond Cauſes were to be taken away; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are Angels and miniſtring Spirits in the World, for the Majeſty of God, not for his Want of them, and for Order, not for his Omnipotency. And here, if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors return and ſay, who told you that there are Spirits? Is not yours a precarious
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0180400100:288"/>
Hypotheſis? Mayn't we have leave to recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in this Place? Pray, who told <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> that there were Intelligencies that moved the Caeleſtial Spheres? Is not this Hypotheſis as precarious as any Man may pretend that of Spirits to be? And we believe there are few Philoſophers at preſent, who agree with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in that Opinion; and we dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this to be ours, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> took his Intelligencies from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who went according to the ſame whimſical, tho' pretty Notion, which firſt gave Riſe to the Fiction of the Nine Muſes: But more than all this, it is a very great Doubt among learned Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Book <hi>de Mundo</hi> be <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s or no.</p>
               <p>The next Thing the Objectors bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Exiſtence of Spirits, is, that it is Nonſenſe for Men to ſay that there are ſuch Beings of which it is impoſſible for a Man to have any Notion, and they inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it that it is impoſſible for any Man to form an Idea of a ſpiritual Subſtance. As to this part, the Defendants rejoin, that they think our late moſt judicious Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> in his cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate and finiſh'd Eſſay on humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, has fairly made out, that Men have as clear a Notion of <hi>a ſpiritual Subſtance</hi> as they have of <hi>any corporeal Subſtance, Matter,</hi> or <hi>Body;</hi> and that there is as much Reaſon for admitting the Exiſtence of the <hi>one,</hi> as of the <hi>other;</hi> for that if they admit the <hi>latter,</hi> it is but Humour in them to deny the <hi>former.</hi> It
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0180400100:289"/>
is in Book the 2<hi>d, Chap.</hi> 29. where he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus: <q rend="inline">"If a Man will examine himſelf, concerning his Notion of pure Subſtance in general, he will find he has no other Idea of it, but only a Suppoſition of he knows not what Support of ſuch Quality which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing ſimple Ideas in us, which Qualities are commonly called Accidents. Thus if we talk or think of any particular ſort of corporeal Subſtance, as <hi>Horſe, Stone,</hi> &amp;c. tho' the Idea we have of either of them be but the Complication or Collection of thoſe ſeveral ſimple Ideas, or ſenſible Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we uſe to find united in the Thing call'd <hi>Horſe</hi> or <hi>Stone;</hi> yet becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how they ſhould ſubſiſt alone not one in another, we ſuppoſe them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in and be ſupported by ſome common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which Support we denote by the Name of Subſtance, tho' it be certain we have no clear or diſtinct Idea of that Thing we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Support. The ſame happens concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Operations of our Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reaſoning, and Fearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we concluding not to ſubſiſt of themſelves, and not apprehending how they can belong to <hi>Body;</hi> we are apt to think theſe the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>ſome Subſtance</hi> which we call <hi>Spirit:</hi> Whereby it's evident, that having no other Notion of Matter, but ſomething, wherein thoſe many ſenſible Qualities, which affect our Senſes, do ſubſiſt, by ſuppoſing a Subſtance,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0180400100:290"/>
wherein Thinking, Knowing, Doubting, and a Power of Moving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do ſubſiſt, we have as <hi>clear</hi> a Notion of the Nature or Subſtance of <hi>Spirit,</hi> as we have of <hi>Body;</hi> the one being ſnppoſed to be (without knowing what is the <hi>Subſtratum</hi> to thoſe ſimple Ideas, which we have from without, and the other ſuppoſed (with a like Ignorance of what it is) to be the <hi>Subſtratum</hi> of theſe Operations which we experiment in ourſelves within). 'Tis plain then, that the Idea of corporeal Subſtance in Matter, is as remote from our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Apprehenſions as that of ſpiritual Subſtance, and therefore from our not having any Notion of the Subſtance of Spirit, we can no more conclude its not Exiſtence, than we can for the ſame Reaſon deny the Exiſtence of Body; it being as rational to affirm there is <hi>no Body,</hi> becauſe we cannot know its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as it's called, or have the Idea of the Subſtance of Matter, as to ſay, there is no Spirit, becauſe we know not its Eſſence, or have no Idea of a ſpiritual Subſtance."</q> Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> alſo comparing our Idea of Spirit with our Idea of Body, thinks there may ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſs Obſcurity in the former than the latter. Our Idea of Body, he takes to be an extended ſolid Subſtance, capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Motion by Impulſe; and our Idea of Soul is a Subſtance that thinks, and has a Power of exciting Motion in Body by Will or Thought. Now, ſome perhaps will ſay,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0180400100:291"/>
they comprehend a thinking Thing which perhaps is true; but, he ſays, if they conſider it well, they can no more comprehend an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Thing; and if they ſay, they know not what it is thinks in them, they mean they know not what the Subſtance is of that thinking Thing; no more, ſays he, do they know what the Subſtance is of that ſolid Thing; and if they ſay, they know not how they think, he ſays, neither do they know how they are extended, how the ſolid Parts are united, or where to make Extenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The learned Monſieur <hi>le Clerc,</hi> who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally knows how far humane Reaſon can bear, argues conſonantly to what is before deliver'd by Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> in his <hi>Coronis</hi> added to the end of the fourth Volume of his Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Works, in the third Edition of them, where he writes as followeth.</p>
               <p>When we contemplate the corporeal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we can ſee nothing in it but Extenſion. Diviſibility, Solidity, Mobility, and various Determinations of Quantity, or Figures; which being ſo, it were a raſh Thing, and contrary to the Laws of right Reaſoning, to affirm o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things of Bodies; and conſequently from mere Body, nothing can be deduced by us, which is not joined in a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the ſaid Properties: Therefore thoſe, who have thought the Properties of perceiving by Senſe, of Underſtanding, Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0180400100:292"/>
Imagining, Remembring, and others the like, which have no Affinity with corporeal Things to have riſen from the Body, have greatly tranſgreſſed in the Method of right Reaſoning and Philoſophiſing, which hath been done by <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and thoſe, who have thought as he did, having affirmed our Minds to be compoſed of corporeal Atoms: But <hi>whence</hi> ſhall we ſay, they have had their Riſe? truly, they do not owe their Riſe to <hi>Matter</hi> which is wholly deſtitute of Senſe and Thought, nor are they ſpontaneouſly ſprung up from nothing, it being an <hi>ontological Maxim</hi> of moſt evident Truth, that <hi>nothing ſprings from nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus given the Reader the firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made againſt the Exiſtence of Spirits, and the <hi>Refutations</hi> thereof, I muſt now frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own on which ſide my Opinion leans, and for my Part, it ſeems manifeſt to me that there are two Beings; we conceive very plainly and diſtinctly, <hi>viz. Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that it would be as <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>ridiculous</hi> to deny the Exiſtence of the <hi>one,</hi> as of the <hi>other:</hi> And really, if the Refuters have got the better in their Way of Reaſoning, they have ſtill a much greater Advantage over the Objectors, when they come to back theſe Reaſons with freſh Arguments drawn from Experience. Of this, there having been many undoubted Narratives given in the foregoing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0180400100:293"/>
Pages, concerning the Apparitions of Spirits, I ſhall refer the Reader back again to them, and only ſubjoin here one or two Inſtances, which may, if required, be prov'd upon Oath, of Spirits ſeen by two Perſons of our <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi>'s own Acquaintance. In the Year 1711, one Mrs. <hi>Stephens,</hi> and her Daughter, were together with Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Ramell</hi>'s, a very great and noted Weaver at <hi>Haggerſtone,</hi> where the rainy Weather detained them till late at Night. Juſt after the Clock ſtruck Twelve, they all of them went to the Door to ſee if the Rain had ceaſed, being extremely deſirous to get home. As ſoon as ever they had open'd the Door and were all got together, their appear'd before them a Thing all in White, the Face ſeem'd of a diſmal pallid Hue, but the Eyes thereof fiery and flaming like Beacons, and of a ſaweer Size. It made its Approaches to them, till it came up within the Space of about three Yards of them, there it fixt and ſtood like a Figure agaze, for ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes; and they all ſtood likewiſe ſtiff like the Figure, frozen with Fear, Motionleſs, and Speechleſs: When all of a ſudden it vaniſh'd from their Eyes; and that Apparition to the Sight was ſucceeded by a Noiſe, or the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Noiſe, like that, which is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Fighting of twenty maſtiff Dogs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0180400100:294"/>
Not long after, Mrs. <hi>Anne Stephens,</hi> who lived in <hi>Spittlefields,</hi> a Woman well known by her great Dealings with Mercers upon <hi>Ludgate-Hill,</hi> ſitting in her Houſe alone, and muſing upon Buſineſs, happened by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to look behind her, and ſaw a dead Corps, to her thinking, lie extended upon the Floor, juſt as a dead Corps ſhould be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that the Foot of one Leg was fix'd on the Ground as it is in a Bed, when one lies with one Knee up; ſhe look'd at it a long while, and by degrees at laſt ſtole her Eyes from ſo unpleaſing and unexpected an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. However a ſtrange kind of a Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty overcame her Fears, and ſhe ventured a ſecond Time to turn her Head that Way, and ſaw it, as before, fix'd for a conſiderable time longer, but durſt not ſtir from her Seat; ſhe again withdrew her Eyes from the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and melancholy Spectacle, and reſum'd the Courage, after a little Reflection, of view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it again, and reſolving to aſcertain her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if the Viſion was real, by getting up from her Seat and going to it, but upon this third Retroſpection ſhe found it vaniſh'd. This Relation ſhe writ down to Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> and has told before Mrs. <hi>Ramell,</hi> her own Siſter, and many other very credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons. Now as to theſe Arguments from Experience, I ſhall alſo deliver my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; I diſpute not but that learned Men, who have obſtinate Prepoſſeſſions, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0180400100:295"/>
plauſible Arguments, why all Things ſhould be thought to be done by Impoſture which ſeem ſtrange to them, and interfere with their Belief; and truly thus far their Humour may be indulged, that if only one Perſon relates a very ſtrange and ſurpriſing Story, a Man may be more apt to think it is <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> for that Perſon to <hi>lie,</hi> than that ſo <hi>ſtrange</hi> a Relation ſhould be <hi>true;</hi> but if a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Number of Perſons of ſeveral Countries, ſeveral Religions, ſeveral Profeſſions, ſeveral Ages, and thoſe Perſons look'd upon to be of as great Sagacity as any the Country af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, agree in Relations of the ſame Kind, tho' very ſtrange, and are ready to vouch the Truth of them upon Oath after having well conſider'd Circumſtances; I think it a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law of Nature to reject all theſe Relations as fabulous, merely upon a ſelf-preſuming Conceit, unleſs a Man can fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the Things to be impoſſible, or can demonſtrate wherein thoſe Perſons were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on; for from hence, I form the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluſive Argument. What is poſſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Reaſon, grows probable according to Belief, where the Poſſibility is atteſted to have reduc'd itſelf into Action by Perſons of known Credit and Integrity. Now, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Poſſibility of the Exiſtence of Spirits, but the actual Exiſtence thereof is proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove by logical Demonſtration; therefore are we to believe both by the Courſe of logical
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0180400100:296"/>

               <head>Second Objection againſt the Exiſtence of Witches.</head>
               <p>THESE Objectors go on to ſay, that provided they ſhould allow there is an Exiſtence of Spirits, yet that would be ſtill no Argument how <hi>Magick</hi> ſhould ſubſiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deny that it is impoſſible for a Man in his Body to have a Commerce, much leſs make a Contract with Spirits; but here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the <hi>Refuters</hi> alledge, they have both Experience and Reaſon on their Sides. As a joint Argument of Reaſon and Experience, they tell you, that the numerous Witches which have in all Countries been arraigned and condemned upon this Occaſion, are evident Teſtimonies of this Commerce, and Contract being held and made with Spirits. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay, that theſe Objectors call not their, the Refuters, Judgment ſo much in Queſtion, who contend that there is a magick Art, as they call in Queſtion the Judgment of all the wiſeſt legiſlative Powers in Chriſtendom,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0180400100:297"/>
who have univerſally agreed in enacting penal Laws againſt ſuch capital Offenders.</p>
               <p>But here the Objectors return and ſay, that it being impoſſible for us to ſhew <hi>the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how</hi> ſuch a Contract ſhould be made, we can never, but without Reaſon, believe a Thing to be, of which we can form no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Idea. The Refuters, on the other hand, reply with the learned Father <hi>le Brune;</hi> it's manifeſt, that we can ſee but two ſorts of Beings; <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Bodies,</hi> and that ſince we can reaſon but according to our own Ideas, we <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>aſcribe</hi> to <hi>Spirits</hi> what <hi>cannot</hi> be produced by <hi>Bodies.</hi> Indeed, the Author of the Republick of Learning, in the Month of <hi>Auguſt, Anno</hi> 1686, has given us a rough Draft for writing a good Tract of Witchcraft, which he looks upon as a <hi>Deſideratum.</hi> Where among other Things he writes thus; Since this Age is the true Time of Syſtems, one ſhould be contriv'd concerning the Commerce that may be betwixt Daemons and Men.</p>
               <p>On this Paſſage, Father <hi>le Brune</hi> writes thus. <q rend="inline">"Doubtleſs here the Author complies with the Language of a great many Perſons, who, for want of Attention and Light, would, have us put all Religion in Syſtems. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Regard I ought to have for many of thoſe Perſons, I muſt not be afraid to ſay, that there is no Syſtem to be made of thoſe Truths, which we ought to learn diſtinctly by Faith, becauſe we muſt advance nothing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0180400100:298"/>
here, but what we receive from the Oracle. We muſt make a Syſtem to explain the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Loadſtone, the Ebbing and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea, the Motion of the Planets; for that the Cauſe of theſe Effects is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſignified to us, and many may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us; and to determine us, we have need of a great number of Obſervations, which, by an exact Induction, may lead us to a Cauſe that may ſatisfie all the <hi>Phoenomena.</hi> It's not the ſame in the Truths of Religion, we come not at them by groping, it were to be wiſh'd Men ſpoke not of them, but after a deciſive and infallible Authority. It's thus we ſhould ſpeak of the Power of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and of the Commerce they have with Men; it's of Faith, that they have Power, and that they attack Men, and try to ſeduce them divers Ways. It is true indeed, they are ſometimes permitted to have it over the Juſt, tho' they have it not ordinarily, but over thoſe, that want Faith, or Fear, not to partake of their Works; and that to the laſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the <hi>diſorder'd Intelligencies</hi> try to make exactly ſucceed what they wiſh; inſpiring them to have Recourſe to certain Practiſes by which thoſe ſeducing Spirits enter into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with Men."</q> Thus far Father <hi>le Brune.</hi> But ſtill theſe Objectors demand to know, by <hi>what Means</hi> this Commerce may be held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Daemons and Men, and urge us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>Manner;</hi> or pretend that they have
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0180400100:299"/>
ſtill reaſon to refuſe coming into the Belief of a Thing, which we would impoſe upon them, tho' wholly ignorant of it ourſelves: To that, the Refuters anſwer thus, That both Chriſtian Divines, and Phyſicians agree, (as to the manner how, which they are ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in enquiring after,) that <hi>Daemons</hi> ſtir up Raptures and Extaſies in Men, binding or looſing the exterior Senſes, and that either by ſtopping the Pores of the Brain, ſo that the Spirits cannot paſs forth, (as it's done natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by Sleep) or by recalling the ſenſitive Spirits, from the outward Senſes to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Organs, which he there retains: So the Devil renders Women Witches extatical and Magicians, who, while they lie faſt aſleep in one Place, think they have been in divers Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and done many Things. This the learned Objectors ſay proceeds from no Daemon, but from the Diſeaſe call'd an Epilepſy; but, on the other hand, the more learned Refuters inſiſt upon it, that theſe Extaſies are not epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick Scizures: This, ſay they, appears from <hi>Bodin,</hi> in his <hi>Theatre of univerſal Nature,</hi> where he ſays, <q rend="inline">"That thoſe, that are wrapt by the Devil, feel neither Stripes nor Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, nor no Wreſting of their Limbs, nor burning Tortures, nor the Application of a red hot Iron; nay, nor is the Beat of the Pulſe, nor the Motion of the Heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in them; but afterwards, returning to themſelves, they feel moſt bitter Pains
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0180400100:300"/>
of the Wounds received, and tell of Things done at 600 Miles diſtance, and affirm themſelves to have ſeen them done."</q> The ingenious Dr. <hi>Ader,</hi> makes an admirable phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Diſtinction between this kind of Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and a Syncope, or Stupor, cauſed by narcotick Medicines. <hi>Sennertus,</hi> in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutio Medica,</hi> writes of the Daemoniacal Sopor of Witches, who think they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd thro' the Air, dance, feaſt, and have Copulation with the Devil, and do other Things in their Sleep, and afterwards believe the ſame Things waking. Now, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are really ſo carry'd in the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or being in a profound Sleep, or only Dream they are ſo carry'd and perſiſt in that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after they are awake: Theſe Facts or Dreams cannot be natural; for it cannot be, that there ſhould be ſo great an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Dreams, of Perſons differing in Place, Temperament, Age, Sex, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that in one Night, and at the ſame Hour, they ſhould, in concert, dream of one and the ſame ſuch Meeting, and ſhould agree, as to the Place, Number, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Perſons, and the like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but ſuch Dreams are ſuggeſted from a preternatural Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Devil to his Confederate, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Permiſſion of an Almighty Power, where Puniſhments are to be permitted to be inflicted upon reprobate Sinners."</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0180400100:301"/>
Whence alſo, to thoſe Witches ſincerely converted, and refuſing to be any more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at thoſe diabolical Meetings, thoſe Dreams no longer happen, which is a Proof that they proceeded, not before, from a natural Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Here begins the great Point of the Diſpute as to that Branch of Magick, which we call Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Magick. The Objectors may tell us, that they will freely own, that there may be an Exiſtence of Spirits, that there may be an Exiſtence of Witches, that by a divine Power Men may be influenced, ſo far as to have a Communication with good Spirits, and that from thence, they may become ſpiritual divine Magicians: They will likewiſe, perhaps, as freely grant, that by the Intervention of a Daemon, Things preternatural may be brought about by Perſons, who have ſtudied the Daemoniacal Magick, but then what they principally inſiſt upon, is, that it muſt be contradictory to all humane Reaſon, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that there can be ſuch a Thing as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Magicians; and thus far they may form their Argument. They ſay, that the Perſons, who contend for the magick Art, own, that all that is brought about by Magick, is by the Aſſiſtance and Help of a Spirit, and that conſequently, what is Effected by it, muſt be preternatural: Now, they ſay, it is a Thing inconſiſtent by a Natural Power, to bring about a preternatural Effect; therefore, there
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0180400100:302"/>
can be no ſuch Thing as Natural Magick, which has within itſelf the Efficacy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying thoſe Acts done by Magicians, in the Diabolical.</p>
               <p>To this, the Refuters take leave to reply, that the Foundation, upon which the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is built, is wrong grounded; they have admitted, that, in diabolical Art Magick, there may be a Commerce held between Men and Spirits, by which ſeveral preternatural Effects may be brought about; and the Reaſon they aſſign for it there, is, becauſe there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Agent concerned therein, the Devil: But then, ſay they, in Natural Magick, you can pretend to no ſuch Agent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to no ſuch preternatural Effect. This Argument contains within it two Falacies: Firſt, as to the Commerce held between a Man and a Daemon, there is nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural in getting the Acquaintance; the Will of the Man is entirely Natural, either naturally good, or naturally corrupted: The black Spirit that converſeth with him, it is acknowledg'd is not ſo, but it is from the Will of the Man; not from the Power veſted in the Devil, that the Acquaintance firſt grows, therefore the Acquaintance it ſelf is natural, tho' it ariſes from the laſt Corruption and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations of Nature, but being made with a preternatural Exiſtence tho' the Cauſe of the Acquaintance be corruptedly Natural, yet the intermediate Cauſe or Means after that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0180400100:303"/>
Acquaintance is not ſo, and therefore the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that intermediate Cauſe may be wonderful, and ſeem to be out of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe of Nature. Now, ſince it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally allow'd, that there are Natural Spirits of the Elements as well as Divine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal, what we have to prove is only this; that Man by Natural Magick may have a Commerce with Natural Spirits of their Elements, as Witches may have with the Spirits or Daemons. Now, as we ſaid before, the Commerce itſelf depends upon the Will of the Perſon, and is therefore Natural, and conſequently may as well ſubſiſt between the one as the other; for the Devil cannot force a Man to hold a Commerce with him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or no. The ſecond Falacy is calling the Effect preternatural, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as it connotates the Agent that brought it about, which is a ſpiritual Agent; for the Effect is (in itſelf conſider'd) Natural, and brought about by ſecond Cauſes that are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, by the Devil's Penetration, who is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile enough to make uſe of them for ſuch and ſuch Ends. Now Men by Natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are of a Faculty thoroughly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, may as well with natural ſecond Cauſes compaſs the Remedy of an evil Spirit, as the Devil is able to infect Men with it. From theſe Speculations a farther plain Conſequence may be deduced, how a Man may, by the pure Force of Natural Magick, cure a Perſon that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0180400100:304"/>
is infeſted with Evils by a Daemon; for how is it that a Daemon infeſts any Body with his evil Motions? It's true, he is a preternatural Agent, but the evil Effect he does, is brought about by Natural Cauſes. For how does a Daemon ſtir up Raptures or Extaſies in Men? why he does it (as we are told above) by bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or looſing the exterior Senſes, by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Pores of the Brain, ſo that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits cannot paſs forth: And this, the Art of Phyſick can compaſs by its Drugs, and Sleep cauſes the ſame Thing very naturally of itſelf; therefore as the Evil itſelf is Natural, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, that is Natural, will certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it: But then, ſay you, why can't thoſe Perſons be cured by Phyſicians? I anſwer, not becauſe their Remedies are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficient to cure the Evils themſelves, but becauſe generally Phyſicians don't ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter their Drugs as Chriſtians, but as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians; and when they preſcribe them to the Sick, they generally preſcribe to them only purely conſider'd as Patients, not as Chriſtians, and therein they come to fail: Becauſe the Agent, the Devil, is a ſubtle Spirit that brings the Evil, and alters its Situation before the Remedy, which would maſter it otherwiſe, can take any Effect; which Agent, the Devil, is employ'd by the horrible and impious Faith of the Antiphyſician, <hi>viz.</hi> the black Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: But, if the Phyſician would act the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, at the ſame time, ſo far as to have a
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0180400100:305"/>
Faith that Things ordain'd in the Courſe of Nature, for the Good of Man, would have its Effects in ſpite of a Devil, if taken with a good Faith by the Patient: That all good Things ordain'd to be for the natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Men, if they took it with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the Sender, would have due Effect; why then the Natural Spirits of the Elements would reſiſt the farther Agency of the Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal Spirit, and then nothing but the Natural Evil (cauſed at firſt by the Daemon) remaining in the Perſon without the farther Superintendency of the Daemon, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively be taken away by the mere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Remedy or Medicine. And thus good and pious Phyſicians making uſe of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies as their Skill teaches them, and having an honeſt Faith, that the Goods of Nature intended for the Uſe and Benefit of Man, if received by the Patient with the ſame good Faith, is above the Power of the Devil to fruſtrate, may not improperly be called Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Magicians. Theſe Arguments of mine, I ſhall now take Leave to back by Experience.</p>
               <p>Beſides, what we have urged from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, concerning the Power of Natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, we ſhall only ſubjoin, that Divines themſelves hold that Natural Magick, and alſo Natural Divinations, and Prophecies, are proved by Quotations from that venerable Writ which is their Guide; and bring Proofs from the ſame alſo, that by Natural Magick
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0180400100:306"/>
Daemons are alſo caſt forth, but not all kinds of Daemons, and ſo many Works of Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are wrought by Natural Magick: They tell you, ſuch was the <hi>Pythoniſſa</hi> that raiſed the Apparition to <hi>Saul,</hi> which appeared in a Body of Wind and Air. Thus, if a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by Natural Magick ſhould caſt out Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, it does not follow, that this was alſo from Divine Magick; and if Daemons are caſt out by Natural Magick, by one that is in the Fear of God, it does not follow that he is a true Magician of God, but if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitates to Daemoniacal, then it is condemned; and when Natural Magick keeps within its Bounds, the Divines tell us, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd in the venerable Book which is the Chriſtian's ſure Guide. But, inaſmuch as the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs even of Natural Magick has been called in Queſtion by others, I ſhall, in an <hi>Appendix</hi> join'd to this Treatiſe, examine that Matter both according to the Reaſons of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Laws, and according to the beſt ſtated Rules of Caſuiſtry that I am a Maſter of; ſtill ſubmitting my Judgment to the ſuperior Judgment of thoſe who are profeſs'd Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Lawyers: And if my Opinions prove erroneous, I am willing to retract them; and therefore, in this place, there remains nothing farther for me to do, but only, as I have ſhewn, on the one hand, how Natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and its powerful Operations are prov'd by Reaſon; to ſhew, on the other hand, how
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0180400100:307"/>
far Reaſon in theſe Caſes, is likewiſe back'd and ſupported by well-evidenc'd Practice, and notorious Experience. And to do this, after having mentioned one memorable Inſtance, which I refer the Reader to in the Body of the Book, concerning the Performances of Mr. <hi>Greatrix,</hi> to which a Lord <hi>Orrery</hi> was a Witneſs in <hi>Ireland;</hi> I ſhall, to avoid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity, bring the other Teſtimonials of Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, from the Succeſs which our <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> himſelf has had in this Way on other Occaſions.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1713, lived in <hi>Fanchurch-ſtreet,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Coates,</hi> a Tobacco-Merchant, who had been for many Years ſorely tormented in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and had had Recourſe for a Cure to all the moſt eminent Phyſicians of the Age, even up to the great Dr. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> himſelf; but all this mighty Application for Relief was ſtill in vain: Each Doctor own'd him a Wonder and a Myſtery to Phyſick, and left him as much a Wonder as they found him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Profeſſors of Surgery gueſs at his Ailment, or reſolve the Riddle of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper; and after having ſpent, from firſt to laſt, above a thouſand Pounds in ſearch of proper Remedies, they found the Search ineffectual: The learned all agreed, that it could proceed from nothing elſe but Witchcraft; they had now indeed gueſs'd the Source of his Illneſs, but it was an Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a Kind, that, when they had
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0180400100:308"/>
found it out, they thought themſelves not the proper Perſons to preſcribe to him any Remedies. That Task was reſerv'd, it ſeems, for our <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> who, upon ſome Body's Information or other, was ſent for to the betwiched Patient Mr. <hi>Coates,</hi> who found him the Wonder, that the others had left him, but did Wonders in undertaking and compaſſing his Cure. I remember, one of the Ingredients made uſe of, was boiling his own Water, but I can't tell how 'twas uſed; and, upon turning over the Books of ſome great Phyſicians ſince, I have found, that they themſelves have formerly deliver'd that, as one part of the Preſcriptions for the Cure of Patients in like Caſes. But as there are other Things, which Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> performs, that ſeem to require a Mixture of the Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and of this Natural Magick before they can be brought about, I will entertain the Reader with one or two Paſſages of that ſort likewiſe, and ſo conclude the Hiſtory of this ſo ſingular a Man's Life and Adventures.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1710, a Gentlewoman loſt about ſix Pounds Worth of <hi>Flanders-lace,</hi> and inaſmuch as it was a Preſent made to her Husband, ſhe was concerned as much as if it had been of twenty Times the Value; and a Lady of her Acquaintance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit her, to whom ſhe unfolded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Things in diſcourſe this little Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter: The Lady ſmiling, reply'd, with this
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0180400100:309"/>
Queſtion, did you never hear, Madam, of Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell?</hi> It is but making your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to him, Things that are loſt, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately found; the Power of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, exceeds even the Power of Laws; they but reſtrain, and frighten, and puniſh Robbers, but he makes Thieves expiate their Guilt, by the more virtuous Way of turning Reſtorers of the Goods they have ſtoln. Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd the loſing Gentlewoman, you ſmile, when you tell me this, but really, as much a Triflc as it is, ſince 'twas a Preſent to my Husband, I can't help being ſenſibly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, a Moment's Diſappointment to him in the leaſt Thing in Nature, creates in me a greater Uneaſineſs, than the greateſt Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to my ſingle ſelf could do, in Things of Moment and Importance. What makes me ſmile, ſaid the Lady, when I ſpeak of it, or think of it, is the Oddneſs and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity of this Man's Talent in helping one to ſuch Things, but, without the leaſt Jeſt, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that I know, by Experience, theſe Things come within the Compaſs of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and I muſt ſeriouſly tell you, for your farther Satisfaction, that he has help'd me, and ſeveral of my Friends, to the finding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Things loſt, which were of great Value. And is this, without laughing, true, ſaid the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fair, very gravely, and demurely, like a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon half believing, and deſirous to be fully confirmed in ſuch a Belief? The Lady, ſhe
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0180400100:310"/>
advis'd with, did then aſcertain her of the Truth of the Matter, alledging that, for a ſingle half Guinea, he would inform her of her Things, and deſcribe the Perſon that convey'd them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. No ſooner was this Gentlewoman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, but ſhe was eager for the Tryal, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited her Friend to conduct her to Mr. <hi>Campbell;</hi> and upon the firſt Word of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe was hooded and ſcarf'd immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they coach'd it away in a Trice to Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Houſe, whom they luckily found within.</p>
               <p>The Ladies had not been long ſeated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wrote down the Name of this new Client of his, exactly as it was, <hi>viz.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Saxon.</hi> Then ſhe was in good Hopes, and with much Confidence, propounded to him the Queſtion about the Lace. He pauſed but a very little while upon the Matter, before he deſcrib'd the Perſon that took it, and ſatisfy'd her, that in two or three Days ſhe would be Miſtriſs of her Lace again, and find it in ſome Book, or Corner of her Room. She preſented him a Half-guinea, and was very contentedly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away; but Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> very kindly ſtop'd her, and ſignify'd to her, that, if ſhe had no more to offer to him, he had ſomething of more Importance to reveal to her: She ſate full of Expectation while he wrote this new Matter; and the Paper he deliver'd to her contain'd the following Account. As for the Loſs of a little bit of Lace, it is a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0180400100:311"/>
mere Trifle; you have loſt a great many hundreds of Pounds, which your Aunt (nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Name) left you, but you are bubbled out of that large Sum. For while you was artfully required down Stairs about ſome pretended Buſineſs or other, one Mr. <hi>H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>tt<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>_…</desc>
                     </gap>n,</hi> convey'd your Aunt's Will out of the Desk, and ſeveral other Things of Value, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the Names of all the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, which put Mrs. <hi>Saxon</hi> in a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation: He concluded this Paper, with bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her go home with a contented Mind, ſhe ſhould find her Lace in a few Days, and as ſhe found that Prediction prove true, ſhe ſhould afterwards come and conſult about the the Reſt.</p>
               <p>When ſhe came home (it ſeems) big at firſt with the Thoughts of what ſhe had been told, ſhe rifled and ranſack'd every Corner, but no Lace was to be met with; all the next Day, ſhe hunted in the like manner, but frighten'd the whole Time, as if ſhe thought the Devil was the only Perſon could bring it, but all to no Purpoſe; the third Day her Curioſity abated, ſhe gave over the Hopes of it, and took the Prediction as a vain Deluſion, and that, what ſhe gave for it, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Money thrown away after what had been loſt before. That very Day, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens in ſuch Caſes, when ſhe leaſt dreamt of it, ſhe lighted on't by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Surprize. She ran with it in her
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0180400100:312"/>
Hand immediately to her Husband, and now ſhe had recover'd it again, told him of the Loſs of it, and the whole Story of her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been at Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s about it; and then amplifying the Diſcourſe about what he had told her beſides, as to more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Affairs, ſhe ſaid, ſhe reſolv'd to go and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult him a little farther about them, and begg'd her Husband to accompany her. He would fain have laugh'd her out of that Opinion and Intent, but the End was, ſhe perſuaded him into it, and prevailed upon him to ſeem at leaſt very ſerious about the Matter, and go with her to the Oracle, aſſuring him there was no room for doubting the ſame Succeſs.</p>
               <p>Well! to Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s they accordingly came, and after Mr. <hi>Saxon,</hi> in Deference to his Wife's Deſire, had paid our Predictor a handſome Complement of Gold; Mr. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Campbell</hi> ſaluted him in as grateful a manner, with the Aſſurance, that there was in <hi>Kent,</hi> a little Country Houſe with ſome Lands appertaining to it, that was his in right of his Wife: That he had the Houſe, as it were, before his Eyes, that tho' he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubſtantially ſeen it, nor been near the Place where it ſtood, he had ſeen it figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively as if in exact Painting and Sculpture, that particularly it had four green Trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Door; from whence he was poſitive, that if Mr. <hi>Saxon</hi> went with him in queſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0180400100:313"/>
of it, he ſhould find it out, and know it as well the Moment he come near it, as if he had been an Inhabitant in it all his Life.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Saxon,</hi> tho' ſomewhat of an Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, yet, muſt naturally wiſh to find it true, you may be ſure, and yet partly doubting the Event, and partly pleaſed with the viſionary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a Fortune henever expected, laugh'd very heartily at the Oddneſs of the Adventure, and ſaid, he would conſider, whether it would not ſavour too much of <hi>Quixotiſm,</hi> to be at the Expence of a Journey on ſuch Frolicks, and on ſuch a chimerical Foundation of airy Hopes, and that then he would call again and let Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> know his Mind upon that Point.</p>
               <p>In every Company he came into, it ſerv'd for Laughter and Diverſion; they all, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, agreed 'twas worth his while, ſince the Journey would not be very expenſive, to go it by way of Frolick. His Wife one Morning, ſaying, that ſhe did remember ſome talk of a Houſe, and ſuch Things as Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> had deſcrib'd, put him forward upon the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and upon Mr. <hi>Saxon</hi>'s propoſing it to his Brother <hi>Barnard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Barnard</hi> favour'd the Propoſal as a Joke, and agreed upon the Country Ramble. They came on Horſeback to Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s, with a third Horſe, on which the Dumb Predictor was mounted, and ſo on they jogg'd into <hi>Kent</hi> towards <hi>Sevenoak,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Place which he deſcrib'd. The firſt Day they ſet out, was on a <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning in <hi>June,</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0180400100:314"/>
and about Five that Afternoon they arrived at the <hi>Black-Bull</hi> at <hi>Sevenoak</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> It being a delicate Evening, they took an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Walk up a fine Hill gracefully adorn'd with Woods to an old Seat of the Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi>'s: Meeting, by the way, with an old Servant of the Earl's, one <hi>Perkins,</hi> he offer'd Mr. <hi>Barnard,</hi> who (it ſeems) was his old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to give them all a Sight of that fine ancient Seat.</p>
               <p>After they had pleaſed themſelves with viewing the antique Nobility of that ſtately Structure, this <hi>Perkins</hi> went back with them to their Inn, the <hi>Bull</hi> at <hi>Sevenoak.</hi> They, that could talk, were very merry in Chat; and the Dumb Gentleman, who ſaw them laugh, and wear all the Signs of Alacrity in their Countenances, was reſolv'd not to be behind with their Tongues, and by Dint of Pen, Ink, and Paper, that he made Signs ſhould be brought in, was reſolv'd (if one might be ſaid to <hi>crack</hi> without <hi>Noiſe</hi>) to crack his Jeſt as well as the beſt of 'em; for it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of him, that he ſeldom comes into any even diverting Company, where he is not the moſt diverting Man there, and the Head (tho' we can't call him the Mouth) of the chearful Society. After having ey'd this <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> a little, and being grown, by his Art, as we may ſuppoſe, as familiar with the Man's Humour, as if he had known him as many Years as Mr. <hi>Barnard:</hi> Pray, Mr. <hi>Barnard,</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0180400100:315"/>
quoth he in writing) how comes it, you that are ſo ſtaunch and ſo ſtiff a Whig, ſhould be ſo acquainted, and ſo particularly fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, with ſuch an old <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Jacobite, as I know that Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi> (whom I never ſaw nor had any Notice of in my Life) to be? And pray, reply'd Mr. <hi>Barnard,</hi> what reaſon have you beyond a Pun to take him for a Jacobite? Muſt he be ſo, becauſe his Name is <hi>Perkin?</hi> I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you in this, you ſhew yourſelf but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a Conjurer; if you can tell no more of Houſes than you do of Men, we may give over our ſearch after the Houſe you ſpoke of (here the Reader muſt underſtand they diſcourſed on their Fingers, and wrote by Turns). Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> reply'd ſeriouſly, laying a Wager is no Argument in other Things, I own, but in this I know it is, becauſe I am ſure, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have laid the Wager, he will fairly confeſs it among Friends, ſince it will go no farther, and I (ſaid Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>) will lay what Wager you will apiece with you all round. Hereupon, Mr. <hi>Barnard,</hi> who had known him a great many Years, was the firſt that laid, and many more, to the Number of five or ſix follow'd his Example; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Matter was deferr'd till next Day at the Return of the old Man to the Inn; they being about to break up that Night, and go to Bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0180400100:316"/>
The next Day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord carry'd his Gueſts to ſee the Country, and after a handſome Walk, they came thro' the Church-yard. They were poring upon the Tombs; no Delight can be greater to Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> than that; and really, by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Walks he uſually takes in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> and the Church-yards adjacent to this Metropolis, one would imagine he takes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſtalk along by himſelf on that dumb ſilent Ground, where the Characters of the Perſons are only to be known, as his own Meaning is, by Writings and Inſcriptions on the Marble. When they had ſufficiently ſurvey'd the Church-yard, it grew near Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-time, and they went homewards; but before they had got many Yards out of the Church-yard, Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> makes a full Stop, pointing up to a Houſe, and ſtopping his Friends a little, he pulls out of his Pocket a Pencil and Paper, and notes down the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words; <hi>That, That is the Houſe my Viſion preſented to me, I could ſwear it to be the ſame, I know it to be the ſame, I am certain of it.</hi> The Gentlemen with him remark'd it, would not take any farther notice, at that Time, intending to inquire into it with Secrecy, and ſo went on to the Inn to Dinner.</p>
               <p>As merry as they had been the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after Supper, they were ſtill more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently chearful this Day after Dinner, till the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0180400100:317"/>
Time of Service begun. When the Duty of the Day was perform'd and over, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to divert and unbend their Minds with pleaſant, but harmleſs Converſation. I ſuppoſe no Body, but a Set of very great Formaliſts, will be offended with Scandal or Scruples, that to Travellers juſt ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Town; Mr. <hi>Perkin</hi> came on that good Day and decided the Wagers, by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the Company (Secrecy being firſt enjoined) that he was a 'Roman Catholick, tho' no Body of the Family knew it in ſo many Years as he had lived there, which was before Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> was born. This, and other innocent Speeches, afforded as much Chearfulneſs as the Lord's Day would allow of.</p>
               <p>On the next Day, being <hi>Monday,</hi> they ſent for one Mr. <hi>Toland Toler,</hi> an Attorney of the Place, to find out to whom that Houſe belong'd, but by all the Inquiry that could poſſibly be made with convenient Secrecy, no Body could find it out for a long time, but at laſt it came to light and appear'd to be juſtly to a Tittle as Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> had predicted.</p>
               <p>Being now ſatisfy'd the next Day, our three Travellers return'd for <hi>London;</hi> and the two vocal Men were very jocular upon their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and by their outward Geſticulations gave the prophetical <hi>Mute</hi> his Share of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Mr. <hi>Barnard,</hi> as they paſs'd into a Farmhouſe-yard, remark'd that all the Hogs
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0180400100:318"/>
fell a grunting and ſqueaking more and more; as Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> came nearer (who, poor Man! could know nothing of the Jeſt, nor the Cauſe of it, till they alighted and told it him by Signs and Writing) ſaid to Mr. <hi>Saxon</hi> laughing, now we have found out our Houſe, we ſhall have only Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> home again by himſelf, we have no farther Need of the Devil, that accompany'd him to the Country, up to Town with us, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Devils enow to be met with there he knows, and ſo this, according to the Faſhion of his Predeceſſor Devils, is enter'd into the Herd of Swine.</p>
               <p>However, the Event of this Journey (to cut the Story ſhort) procured Mr. <hi>Saxon</hi> a great Inſight, upon inquiry, into ſeveral Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs belonging to him, of which he would otherwiſe have had no Knowledge; and he is now engaged in a Chancery Suit to do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Juſtice, and in a fair way of recovering great Sums of Money, which, without the Conſultation he had with this Dumb Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, he had in all likelihood never dreamt of.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1711, a Gentleman, whoſe Name ſhall be, in this Place, <hi>Amandus,</hi> famed for his exquiſite Talents in all Arts and Sciences, but particularly for his Gentleman like and entertaining manner of Converſation, whoſe Company was affected by all Men of Wit, who grew his Friends, and courted by all
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0180400100:319"/>
Ladies of an elegant Taſte, who grew his Admirers: This accompliſh'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I ſay, came to Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to propound a Queſtion to him, which was ſo very intricate, and ſo difficult to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that, if he did anſwer it, it might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to himſelf, and the Ladies he brought with him, the Pleaſure of Admiration in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Thing ſo wonderful in itſelf perform'd; or, on the other hand, if he did not make a ſatisfactory Reply to it, then it might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him and the Ladies a very great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in being the firſt that puzzled a Man, who had had the Reputation for ſo many Years of being capable of baffling all the wittieſt Devices and ſhrewd Stratagems that had been, from time to time, invented to baffle his Skill, and explode his Penetration in the Second-ſight, and the Arts which he pretended to. The Perſons, whom <hi>Amandus</hi> brought with him, were the illuſtrious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Delphina,</hi> diſtinguiſh'd for her great Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but ſtill more celebrated for her Beauty, his own Lady the admired <hi>Amabella,</hi> and a young blooming pretty Virgin whom we will call by the Name of <hi>Adeodata,</hi> about which laſt Lady the Queſtion was to be put to Mr. <hi>Campbell. Adeodata,</hi> it ſeems, was the natural Daughter of this very fine Gentleman, who had never let her into the Knowledge of her own Birth, but had bred her up from her Infancy, under a borrow'd Name, in the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0180400100:320"/>
Notion that ſhe was a Relation's Daughter, and recommended to his Care in her Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Now the Man that had the Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, was to be try'd: It was now to be put to the Proof, if he could tell Names or no? <hi>Amandus</hi> was ſo much an Unbeliever as to be willing to hazard the Diſcovery—<hi>Amabella</hi> and <hi>Delphina</hi> were Strangers to her real Name, and ask'd <hi>Duncan Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> not doubting but he would ſet down that which ſhe ordinarily went by: <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> had indeed been told by <hi>Amandus,</hi> that <hi>Adeodata</hi> was the natural Daughter of a near Friend of his; but who this near Friend was remain'd a Secret: That was the Point which lay upon our <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. When the Queſtion was propoſed to him, what her Name was, he look'd at her very ſtedfaſtly and ſhook his Head, and after ſome Time, he wrote down, that it would be a very difficult Name for him to fix upon. And truly ſo it prov'd; he toil'd for every Letter till he ſweated; and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies laugh'd incontinently, imagining that he was in an Agony of Shame and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at finding himſelf poz'd. He deſired <hi>Amandus</hi> to withdraw a little, for that he could not ſo well take a full and proper Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of Ladies Faces, when a Gentleman was by. This Diſturbance and Perplexity of his, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them ſtill more ſubject of Mirth; and that Excuſe was taken as a Pretence, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0180400100:321"/>
a put-off to cover his Shame the better and hide from one at leaſt, that he was but a downright Bungler in what he pretended to be ſo wonderful an Artiſt. However, after two Hours hard Sweat and Labour, and viewing the Face in different Shades and Lights, (for I muſt obſerve to the Reader that there is a vaſt deal of Difference, ſome he can tell in a Minute or two with Eaſe, ſome not in leſs than four or five Hours, and that with great Trouble) he undeceived them with Regard to his Capacity. He wrote down, that <hi>Adeodata</hi>'s real Name was <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> as being the natural Daughter of <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus. Delphina</hi> and <hi>Amabella</hi> were ſurpriz'd at the Diſcovery; and <hi>Amandus,</hi> when he was call'd in, owning it a Truth, his Wife <hi>Amabella</hi> applauded the curious Way of her coming by ſuch a Diſcovery, when <hi>Adeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data</hi> was juſt marriageable, took a Liking to her as if her own Daughter; and every Thing ended with Profit, Mirth and Chearfulneſs. I could add a thouſand more Adventures of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Life, but that would prove te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious; and as the Town has made a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the Book, it was thought more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to conclude it here. The moſt diverting of all, are to be found beſt to the Life in original Letters that paſs'd between Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> and his Correſpondents, ſome ſelect ones of which will be ſhortly publiſh'd in a little Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et-volume for the farther Entertainment of ſuch

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not that Mr. <hi>Duncan Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> ſtands in need of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to prove that he is, in no reſpect, liable to the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made againſt <hi>Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers,</hi> &amp;c. that I undertake the writing of this <hi>Appendix,</hi> the true Reaſon thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more completely to finiſh this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: For having, in the Body of the Book it ſelf, fully proved a Second-Sight, and that the ſame frequently happens to Perſons, ſome of them eminently remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Piety and Learning, and have from thence accounted for the Manner of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s performing thoſe Things he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, to the great Surprize, and no leſs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all the Curious who are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſult him; and at the ſame time proved the Lawfulneſs of ſuch his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0180400100:324"/>
from the Opinions of ſome of the moſt Learned in holy Science; I thought it not improper to add the following ſhort <hi>Appendix,</hi> (being a Summary of ſeveral Acts of Parliament made againſt <hi>Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers, Conjurers, Egyptians, Sorcerers, Pretenders to Propheſy,</hi> &amp;c. with ſome proper Remarks, ſuited to our preſent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) as well to ſatisfie them who are fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtically Wiſe, and obſtinately ſhut their Eyes againſt the moſt refulgent Reaſon, and are wilfully deaf to the moſt convincing and perſuaſive Arguments, and thereupon cry out, that Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> is either an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor and a Cheat, or at leaſt a Perſon who acts by the Aſſiſtance of unlawful Powers; as alſo to put to ſilence the no leſs waſpiſh Curs, who are always ſnarling at ſuch, whom Providence has diſtinguiſh'd by more excellent Talents than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. True Merit is always the Mark, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which Traducers level their keeneſt Darts; and Wit and Invention oftentimes join Hands with Ignorance and Malice to foil thoſe, who excel. Art has no greater Enemy than Ignorance; and were there no ſuch thing as Vice, Virtue would not ſhine with half its Luſtre. Did Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> perform thoſe wonderful Things he is ſo deſervedly famous for, as theſe Cavillers ſay, by holding Intelligence with Infernal Powers, or by any unjuſtifiable Means, I
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0180400100:325"/>
am of Opinion he would find very few, in this atheiſtical Age, who would open their Mouths againſt him, ſince none love to act Counter to the Intereſt of that Maſter they induſtriouſly ſerve. And did he, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, put the Cheat upon the World, as they maliciouſly aſſert, I fancy he would then be more generally admired, eſpecially in a Country where the Game is ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, artfully, and no leſs profitably play'd, and that with Applauſe, ſince thoſe Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Wiſdom merrily divide the whole Species of Mankind into the two Claſſes of Knaves and Fools, fixing the Appellation of Folly only upon thoſe, whom they think not Wiſe, that is, wicked enough to have a Share with them in the profitable Guilt.</p>
            <p>Our Laws are as well intended by their wiſe Makers to skreen the Innocent, as to puniſh the Guilty; and where their Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are remarkably ſevere, the Guilt they puniſh is of a proportionable ſize. Art, which is a Man's Property, when acquir'd, claims a Protection from thoſe very Laws which falſe Pretenders thereto are to be try'd and puniſhed by, or elſe all Science would ſoon have an end; for no Man would dare make uſe of any Talent Providence had lent him, and his own induſtrious Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had improved, ſhould he be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately try'd and condemn'd by thoſe Statutes,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0180400100:326"/>
which are made to ſuppreſs Villains, by every conceited and half learned Pedant.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed thoſe excellent Statutes, which are made againſt a ſort of People, who pretend to Fortune-telling, and the like, are ſuch as are well warranted, as being built upon the beſt Foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Policy: and were Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> guilty of any ſuch Practice, as thoſe are made to puniſh, I openly declare, that I ſhould be ſo far from endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Cauſe, that I would be one of the firſt that ſhould aggravate his Crime, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to enforce the ſpeedier Execution of thoſe Laws upon him, which are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Offenders. But when he is ſo far from acting, that he doth not even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any ſuch Practice, or for counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the ſame in others, as is manifeſt from the many Detections he has made of that ſort of Villany, which the Book fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us with, I think my ſelf ſufficiently juſtified for thus pleading in his Defence.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take Notice, in Reading the Statutes made againſt ſuch Offenders, our wiſe Legiſlature hath not in any part of them ſeem'd ſo much as to imply, that there are in reality any ſuch wicked Perſons as they are made againſt, to wit, <hi>Conjurers,</hi> &amp;c. but that they are only Pretenders to thoſe infernal Arts, as may reaſonably be
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0180400100:327"/>
inferr'd from the Nature of the Penalties they inflict; for our firſt Laws of that ſort only inflicted a Penalty, which affected the Goods and Liberty of the Guilty, and not their Lives, tho' indeed they were afterwards forced to heighten the Puniſhment with a Halter; not that they were better convinc'd, as I humbly conceive, but becauſe the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals were moſt commonly Perſons who had no Goods to forfeit, and to whom their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was no otherwiſe valuable, but as it gave them the opportunity of doing Miſchief. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our Law-Books do furniſh us with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtances of Perſons, who have been try'd and executed for Witchcraft and Sorcery, but then the wiſer part of Mankind have taken the Liberty to condemn the Magiſtrate, at that time of Day, of too much Inconſideration, and the Juries of an equal ſhare of Credulity: And thoſe who have ſuffer'd for ſuch Crimes, have been commonly Perſons of the loweſt Rank, whoſe Poverty might occaſion a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of them in their Fellow-Creatures, and their too artleſs Defence ſubject them to their miſtaken Juſtice; ſo that upon the whole, I take the Liberty to conclude, and, I hope, not without good Grounds, that thoſe Laws were made to deter Men from an idle Pretence to myſterious and unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Arts, which, if too cloſely purſued, commonly lead them into the darkeſt Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not only that of deceiving others, but
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0180400100:328"/>
as far as in them lye, making themſelves Slaves to the Devil: And not to prevent and hinder Men from uſeful Enquiries, and from the Practice of ſuch Arts, which tho' they are in themſelves myſterious, yet are, and may be lawful.</p>
            <p>I would not however be thought, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to my former Arguments, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that there never were, or that there now are, no Perſons ſuch as Wizards, Sorcerers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for by ſo doing, I ſhould be as liable to be cenſur'd for my Incredulity, as thoſe who defame Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> on that Account, are for their want of Reaſon and common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. Holy and prophane Writ, I confeſs, furniſhes us with many Inſtances of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but we muſt not from thence haſtily infer, that all thoſe Men are ſuch who are ſpightfully branded with the odious Guilt; for were it in the Devil's Power to make every wicked Man a Wizard, and Woman a Witch, he ſoon would have Agents enough to ſhake this lower World to Atoms; but the Almighty, who reſtrains him, likewiſe reſtrains thoſe.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed thus much, I ſhall now proceed to conſider ſome of the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament themſelves; the Perſons againſt whom they were made, and the Neceſſity of making the ſame. And ſome of the firſt Acts we meet with, were thoſe which were made againſt a ſort of People called <hi>Egyptians,</hi>

Perſons, who, if in reality ſuch, might, if any, be ſuſpected of practiſing what we call the <hi>Black Art,</hi> the ſame having been for many Ages encouraged in their Country; nay, ſo much has it been by them favour'd, that it was introduced into their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion (if I may without an Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty call it ſo) and made an eſſential Part thereof: And, I believe, <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> has not much mended the Matter, ſince it has imperioſly reigned there, or in any reſpect reform'd that idolatrous Nation. Now the Miſchief theſe Perſons might do (being ſo much in the Devil's Power) among the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary, was thought too conſiderable not to be provided againſt; and therefore our wiſe Legiſlature, the more effectually to prevent the ſame, by ſtriking at the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made an Act in the 22 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. 8. That if any, calling themſelves <hi>Egyptians,</hi> do come into this Realm, they ſhall forfeit all their Goods; and being demanded, ſhall depart the Realm within fifteen Days, upon pain of Impriſonment: and the Importers of them, by another Act, were made liable to a heavy Penalty. This Act was continu'd by the 1 <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M. Conjuration, Witchcraft, Inchantment,</hi> and <hi>Sorcery,</hi> to get Money, or conſume any Perſon in his Body, Members, or Goods, or to provoke any Perſon to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Love, was by the 33 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. 14. and the 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 16. and the 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. 12. made
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0180400100:330"/>
Felony; and by the ſame 33 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. 14. it was made Felony to declare to another any <hi>falſe Propheſies</hi> upon Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this Act was repealed by the 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> VI. 12. but by another Act of the 3 and 4 of <hi>Ed.</hi> VI. 15. it was again enacted, that all ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſhould pretend to <hi>Propheſies,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould, upon Conviction, for the firſt Offence forfeit Ten Pounds, and one Year's Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment; and for the ſecond Offence, all his Goods and Impriſonment for Life. And by the 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> VI. 11. the ſame was made to continue but 'till the then next Seſſions of Parliament. And by the 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 15. the ſame Act was again renewed againſt <hi>fantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Propheſiers,</hi> &amp;c. but both thoſe Acts were repealed by the 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> I. 12.</p>
            <p>Thus far we find, that for Reaſons of State, and for the Puniſhment of particular Perſons, thoſe Acts were made and repealed, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion required, and not kept on foot, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were they ever made uſe of, as I can remember in my reading, againſt any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe Studies led them into a uſeful Enquiry into the Nature of Things, or a lawful Search into the Workings of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf, by which means many Things are foretold long before they come to paſs, as Eclipſes, and the like, which Aſtrologers ſucceſsfully do, whoſe Art has been in all Ages held in ſo great Eſteem, that the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the Eaſt made it their peculiar
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0180400100:331"/>
Study, by which means they deſervedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to themſelves the Name of <hi>Magi</hi> or Wiſe Men; but, on the contrary, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt Perſons profligate and looſe, who, under a Pretence and Mask of Science, commit vile and roguiſh Cheats; and this will the more plainly appear, if we conſider the Letter and expreſs Meaning of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Acts, wherein the Perſons I am ſpeaking of, are deſcribed by ſuch Characters which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove the Aſſertion: For in the 39 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> 4. it was enacted, That all Perſons calling themſelves Scholars going about beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, ſea-faring Men, pretending Loſſes of their Ships and Goods at Sea, and going about the Country begging, or uſing any ſubtile Craft, feigning themſelves to have Knowledge in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy, Palmiſtry,</hi> or any other the like crafty Science, or pretending that they can tell <hi>Deſtinies, Fortunes,</hi> or ſuch like <hi>fantaſtical Imaginations,</hi> ſhall be taken and deem'd <hi>Rogues, Vagabonds, ſturdy Beggars,</hi> and ſhall be ſtripp'd naked from the Middle upwards, and whip'd till his or her Body be bloody. And by the 1 <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 12. for the better reſtraining of the ſaid Offences, and for the farther pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the ſame, it was farther enacted, That any Perſon or Perſons uſing <hi>Witchcraft, Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> &amp;c. and all their Aiders, Abettors, and Counſellors, being convicted, and attainted of the ſame Offences, ſhall ſuffer Pain of Death, as Felons without the Benefit of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy:
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0180400100:332"/>
Or to tell and declare in what place any Treaſure of Gold and Silver ſhould or might be found in the Earth, or other ſecret Places: Or where Goods or Things loſt or ſtol'n ſhould be found or become: Or to provoke any Perſon to unlawful Love, ſuch Offender to ſuffer Impriſonment for one whole Year with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bail or Mainprize, and once in every Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſaid Year ſhall in ſome Market-Town or upon the Market-Day, or at any ſuch Time as any Fair ſhall be kept there, ſtand openly in the Pillory by the Space of ſix Hours, and there ſhall openly confeſs his or their Offence; and for the ſecond Offence ſhall ſuffer Death as Felons without the Benefit of Clergy.</p>
            <p>That theſe Laws were made againſt a Set of Villains, whoſe natural Antipathy to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and Labour, furniſh'd them with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to an uncommon Skill, thereby the more eaſily to gull and cheat the ſuperſtitiouſly credulous, and by that means diſcover from them ſome ſuch Secrets that might far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in perpetrating the more conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Villany, is plain from the very Words and Expreſſions of the very Acts themſelves, and the Deſcription of the Perſons they are made againſt; and not, as I before obſerved, to prevent and hinder Men from the lawful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after uſeful, delightful, and profitable Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> who has been long a ſettled and reputable Inhabitant in many eminent
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0180400100:333"/>
Parts of the City of <hi>London,</hi> cannot, I am ſure, be look'd upon as one of thoſe theſe Acts of Parliament were made againſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we firſt ſtrip the Acts themſelves of their own natural, expreſs and plain Meaning, and cloath them with that which is more obſcure, unnatural, forced, and conſtrain'd a Practice, which, if allowed, would make them wound the Innocent and clear the Guilty, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them not our Defence but our greateſt Evil; they would, by that means, become a perfect <hi>Aenigma,</hi> and be ſo far from being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for their Plainneſs, that they would be even exploded like the Oracles of the Heathen for their double Meaning.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> has the Second-Sight, as is unqueſtionable from the allowed Maxim, that what has been may be again, and by that means can take a View of Contingencies, and future Events; ſo long as he confines theſe Notices of approaching Occurrences to a good Purpoſe, and makes uſe of them only inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and charitably to warn Perſons from doing ſuch Things, that according to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions would lead them into Misfortune, or elſe in putting them upon ſuch Arts that may be of Uſe and Benefit to themſelves and Poſterity, always having a ſtrict Regard to Morality and Religion to which he truly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres: Certainly, I think, he ought ſo much the more to be admired for the ſame, by how much the more this his excellent Knowledge
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0180400100:334"/>
is ſurpaſſing that of other Men, and not be therefore unjuſtly upbraided with the injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Character of a Cheat, or an ill Man: however this I will preſume to affirm, and I doubt not but to have my Opinion confirm'd by the learned Sages of the Law, that this his innocent Practice, and I venture to add honeſt one too, doth by no means intitle him to the Penalties of the before-mentioned Laws made againſt Fortune tellers, and ſuch ſort of profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Wretches; which it is as great an Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to decry, as it would be to call him, who is a ſettled and reputable Inhabitant, a Stroller, or wandring Beggar.</p>
            <p>Again, It is true, that Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved many that have been ſuppoſed to have been Bewitched, as is related and well atteſted in the Book of his Life; but will any one from thence argue that he himſelf is a real Conjurer or Wizard, becauſe he breaks the Chains by which thoſe unhappy Wretches were bound? No ſurely, for if that were the Caſe, we might then as well indict the Phyſician who drives away a malignant Diſtemper, and roots out its latent Cauſe by his myſterious Skill in Plants and Drugs; or conclude that the Judge who condemns a Criminal is for the ſame Reaſon guilty of the ſelf-ſame Crime for which the Offender is ſo by him condemned. Perſons who delight in ſuch unnatural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, muſt certainly be in Love with the greateſt Abſurdities, and muſt intirely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0180400100:335"/>
their natural Reaſon, before they can be brought to conclude that the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would aſſiſt Men in deſtroying his own Power.</p>
            <p>The beſt Anſwer I can afford thoſe Men is Silence; for if they will not argue upon the Principles of Reaſon, or be guided by her Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, I think them no more fit to be contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in a rational and decent manner than Bedlamites, and ſuch who are bereft of all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. A Rod is the beſt Argument for the back of a Fool, and Contempt the beſt Uſage that ought to be ſhewn to every head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong and ignorant Opponent.</p>
            <p>In a word, I know of no Branch of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Practice that bears the leaſt Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to thoſe Crimes mentioned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Acts. That he can and doth tell Peoples Names at firſt Sight, tho' perfect Strangers to him, is confeſſed by all who have made the curious Enquiry at his Hands; but what part of the Acts, I would fain know, is that againſt? Knowledge, and a clear Sight into things not common, is not only an allowable, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Qualification; and whether this Knowledge in him be inherent, accidental, or the reſult of a long Study, the Caſe is ſtill the ſame; ſince we are aſſured he doth it by no unlawful Intelligence, or makes uſe of the ſame to any ill purpoſe, and therefore is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as lawful as to draw natural Concluſions from right Premiſſes. Hard is the Fate of any
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0180400100:336"/>
Man to be ignorant, but much harder would his Lot be, if he were to be puniſhed for being Wiſe, and, like Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> excelling others in this kind of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid in Defence of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> and the Art he profeſſeth, but as the Arguments which are brought againſt him by his Enemies on the one hand, are trivial and ill-grounded, I therefore think they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no farther Refutation; ſo on the other, his Innocency is too clear to require it.</p>
            <p>After having thus taken a Survey of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Acts, with regard to their Legality according to the Statutes and the Laws of the Nation wherein he lives, we will conſider next, whether according to the ſtated Rules of Caſuiſtry, among the great Divines eminent for their Authority, it may be lawful for Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> to predict, or for good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Perſons to viſit his Houſe, and conſult him about his Predictions. I have upon this Head examin'd all the learnedeſt Caſuiſts I could meet with in ancient Times, for I cannot meet (in my reading) with any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns that treat thoroughly upon this Caſe, or I ſhould rather have choſen them, becauſe perhaps the Seond-Sight was leſs known in thoſe antient Days than it has been ſince, and ſo might eſcape their Notice.</p>
            <p>My Deſign is firſt to give the Reader a diſtinct Summary of all that has been ſaid of this Matter, and to do it as ſuccinctly and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0180400100:337"/>
briefly as poſſible, and then to argue myſelf from what they agree upon, as to this Man's particular Caſe.</p>
            <p>That the Reader may have recourſe to the Authors themſelves, if they have a Curioſity, and find that I don't go about to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Judgments, I will here tell the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der where he may find the whole Contents of the following little Abſtract of Divinity and Caſuiſtry, becauſe it would be a tedious piece of Work to ſet down the Words of each of them diſtinctly, and quote them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one round at the end of their ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sentences, which tend to the ſame Meaning, but I will ſtrictly keep to the Senſe of them all; and I here give the Reader their Names, and the Places, that he may conſult them himſelf, if his Inclination leads him to be ſo curious; Thomas Aquinas 4. <hi>Diſtin.</hi> 34. <hi>quaeſtio.</hi> 1. <hi>Art.</hi> 3.

               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0180400100:338"/>
Theſe Divines have generally written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impious Arts of Magick, which they call by the Name of Divination; and this Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as they term it) they divide into two Kinds, the <hi>One,</hi> in which the Devil is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly</hi> invoked to teach hidden and occult things; the <hi>Other,</hi> in which he is <hi>tacitly</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to do the ſame. An <hi>expreſs</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation is by Word or Deed, by which a real Pact is actually made with the Devil, and that is a Sin that affects the Death of the Soul, according to the Laws of Theology, and ought to effect the Death of the Body, according to Civil and Political Laws. The <hi>tacit</hi> Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Daemons is then only, when a Man buſies himſelf ſo far with ſuch Perſons, that it is meet and juſt that the Devil ſhould be permitted to have to do with him, though it was oppoſite to the Intention of the Man.</p>
            <p>But then this <hi>expreſs</hi> Invocation again is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into ſeveral Species, according to the diverſe manners by which the Devil inſtructs theſe Men.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Enchantment,</hi> which I need not deſcribe, and of which I will ſpeak no more, becauſe it is what every Body knows to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, and no Body ought to know the Art thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>Divination</hi> by Dreams, when any Inſtructions are expected from the Devil by way of Dream, which is a capital Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0180400100:339"/>
The third is called <hi>Necromancy,</hi> which is, when by the uſe of Blood and Writing, or Speaking certain Verſes the Dead ſeem to riſe again, and ſpeak and teach future things. For tho' the Devil can't recal a Soul departed, yet he can (as ſome have thought) take the Shape of the dead Corpſe, himſelf actuate it by his Subtilty, as if it was inform'd with a Soul. And ſome affirm, that by the Divine Permiſſion, the Devil can do this, and ſpake ſo in the Caſe of <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi> But Divines of a more ſolid Genius attribute that Power only to the Deity, and ſay, with Reaſon, that it is beyond the Devil's Capacity. But it is certain this was a Divination done in dead Animals by the Uſe of their Blood, and therefore the word is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifics Dead, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies Divination.</p>
            <p>The fourth Species is called <hi>Divination</hi> by the <hi>Pythians,</hi> which was taken from <hi>Apollo,</hi> the firſt Diviner, <hi>as Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſays in his <hi>Secundâ ſecundae qu.</hi> 95. <hi>Artic.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>The fifth is called <hi>Geomancy,</hi> which is when the Devil teaches any thing by certain Signs appearing in the earthly Bodies, as in Wood, Iron, or poliſhd Stones, Berylls, or Glaſs.</p>
            <p>The Sixth is named <hi>Hydromancy,</hi> as when a Daemon teaches any thing by Appearances in the Water.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh is ſtiled <hi>Aeromancy;</hi> and 'tis when he informs People of ſuch things by Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in the Air.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0180400100:340"/>
The eighth is entituled <hi>Pyromancy;</hi> that is, when it inſtructs People by Forms appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fire.</p>
            <p>The ninth is termed <hi>Aruſpicy;</hi> which is, when by Signs appearing in the Bowels of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed Animals the Daemon predicts at Altars.</p>
            <p>Thus far, as to <hi>expreſs</hi> Divination, or Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Devil, which is deteſtable, and the very conſulting of Perſons, that uſe ſuch unlawful Means, is according to the Judgment of all Caſuiſts, the high Road to eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Now as to <hi>tacit</hi> Divination or Invocation of the Devil, that is divided into two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern Kinds. The firſt Kind is, when for the ſake of knowing hidden things, they make uſe of a vain and ſuperſtitious Diſpoſition exiſting in things to judge from; which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not of a ſufficient Virtue to lead them to any real Judgment. The ſecond Kind of <hi>tacit Divination</hi> is, when that Knowledge is ſought by the Diſpoſition of thoſe things, which Men effect on purpoſe and of their own accord, in order to come by and acquire that Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Both theſe kinds of <hi>tacit</hi> Divination are again ſubdivided into ſeveral Species, as are particularly mentioned by St. <hi>Thomas, Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dâ Secundoe.</hi> Quaeſt. 95. Artic. 3. <hi>Gregory de Valentine,</hi> Tomo 3. Diſput. 6. quaeſt. 12. Puncto 2. <hi>Toletus</hi> in Summâ. Lib. 4. cap. 15. And <hi>Michael Medina</hi> Lib. 2. <hi>de rectâ in</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0180400100:341"/>
               <hi>Deumfide: poſt ſanctum Auguſtinum.</hi> Lib. 2. <hi>de Doct. Chriſt.</hi> cap. 19. <hi>&amp; ſequen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Kinds of tacit Divination, contains under it the following ſeveral Species.</p>
            <p>The firſt Species is called <hi>Genethliacal,</hi> which is when from the Movement or Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Stars, Mens Nativities are calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and enquired into ſo far, as that from ſuch a Search they pretend to deduce the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of human Effects, and the contingent Events that are to attend them. This <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> condemns; but I ſhall with Humility and Submiſſion to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Judgments enquire hereafter into their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and give my Opinion why I think this no evil Art; but I ſubmit my Opinion, if, after it is given, it is thought erroneous.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>Augury,</hi> when any thing is predicted from the chattering of Birds, or the voice of Animals, and this may be either law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or unlawful. If it comes from natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct (for Brutes having only a ſenſitive Soul, have their Organs ſubject to the Diſpoſition of the greater Bodies in which they are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and principally of all to the Celeſtial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) his <hi>Augury</hi> is not amiſs. For if when Crows are remark'd to Kaw (as the Vulgar Phraſe is) more than ordinary, it is, judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtinct of their Nature, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Rain, and we may reaſonably depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, we ſhall be right if we foretel Rain to be at hand. But ſometimes the Devils actuate
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0180400100:342"/>
thoſe Brute Animals to excite vain Ideas in Men, contrary to what the Inſtinct of their Nature compels them to. This is ſuperſtitious and unlawful, and forbid in holy Writ.</p>
            <p>The third is <hi>Aruſpicy,</hi> when from the Flight of Birds or any other Motion of any Animals whatſoever, Perſons pretend to have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and a penetrative Knowledge into oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and hidden Matters.</p>
            <p>The fourth conſiſts in <hi>Omens,</hi> when for Example a Man from any Words which others may have ſpoken on purpoſe or by accident, pretends to gather a way of looking into and knowing any thing of Futurity.</p>
            <p>The fifth is <hi>Chiromancy,</hi> which conſiſts in making a pretence to the Knowledge of future things by the Figures and the Lines of the Hands: And if it be by conſulting the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bones of any Beaſt, it goes by the name of <hi>Spatulamancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the firſt kind of Divination, by a <hi>tacit</hi> Invocation of the Devil, is divided into the five Species above mentioned; ſo alſo is the ſecond kind of <hi>tacit</hi> Divination or Invocation of the Devil, divided into two Species by St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin, Secunda ſecundae, quaeſtione nonage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimâ quintâ articulo tertio,</hi> and too tedious to inſert here.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe ways are by theſe Divines counted wicked, and I ſet them down that People may avoid them. For how many Gyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Pretenders to <hi>Chyromancy</hi> have we in
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0180400100:343"/>
               <hi>London</hi> and in the Country? How many that are for <hi>Hydromancy,</hi> that pretend in Water to ſhew Men mighty Myſteries? And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>Geomancy,</hi> with their Berylls and their Glaſſes, that, if they are not under the Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil, propagate the Scandal at leaſt by being Cheats, and who ought to be puniſh'd, to the utmoſt Severity, as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws enact? Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> who hates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns, and abhors theſe ways, ought, methinks, to be encouraged by their being reſtrain'd; and People of curious Tempers, who always receive from him moral and good Inſtructions, which make 'em happy in the Conduct of Life, ſhould be animated in a publick Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to conſult him, in order to divert the curious Itch of their Humours from conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch wicked Impoſtors, or diabolical Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticers, as too frequently abound in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon of the inquiſitive Vulgar, who are more numerous in our Climate, than any I ever read of.</p>
            <p>But now to argue the caſe of Conſcience with Regard to his <hi>particular</hi> Practice by way of the Second-Sight, whether, <hi>in foro Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiae,</hi> it is lawful for him to follow it, or others to conſult him? The Divines above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned having never had any notice of that Faculty in all likelihood, or if they had never mentioning it, makes it a point more difficult for me to diſcuſs; but I think they have ſtated ſome Caſes, by the making of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0180400100:344"/>
which my Premiſſes, I can deduce from all the learned Men I have above quoted a Concluſion in favour of our Mr. <hi>Duncan Campbell,</hi> and of thoſe who conſult him; but my Opinion ſhall be always corrected by thoſe who are wiſer than my ſelf, and to whom I owe entire Submiſſion. I take leave to fix theſe Premiſſes from them firſt, and to form my Argument from them afterwards in the following manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is allowed by all theſe Divines, that a Knowledge which one may have of future Things within the Order of Nature, is, and may be lawful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They imply, that where Juſtice is not violated, it is lawful both to predict, and to conſult.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Many of them, but particularly <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reolus</hi> puts this Queſtion: Is it lawful to go to one that deals in the Black Art, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to cure any innocent Body, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Necromancer</hi> or Dealer in the Black Art may have maliciouſly afflicted, and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Pains? And ſome of theſe Caſuiſts, particularly <hi>Aureolus,</hi> ſay, it is lawful on ſuch an Occaſion to go to ſuch a Conjurer, becauſe the end is not Conjuration, but freeing a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from it.</p>
            <p>But I take leave to diſſent from theſe great Men, and think they are in a double Miſtake;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0180400100:345"/>
firſt in ſtating the Queſtion, and then in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch an Anſwer, provided the Queſtion had been ſtated right.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion is founded upon this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which is paſt by as granted), <hi>viz.</hi> that one <hi>Necromancer</hi> could releaſe a Perſon bewitched by another, which is abſolutely falſe; for it's againſt the Nature of the Devil to be made an Inſtrument to undo his own Works of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety: But admitting and not granting this to be poſſible, and the Queſtion to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated, why ſtill theſe Caſuiſts are out in their Anſwer? It is lawful, reply they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the end of going to the Conjurers, is not Conjuration, but freeing a good Perſon from it: But the end is not the Point here to be conſider'd, it is the Medium which is bad, that is to be conſider'd. It is by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration, (according to their Hypotheſis) the other Conjuration is to be diſſolved; and does not the common Rule, that a Man muſt not do Evil that Good may come of it, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid this Practice? And to ſpeak my Opinion plainly in that caſe, the Friend that ſhould conſult a Conjurer for that end, would be only ſo kind to put his own Soul in danger of being guilty of Hell-torments, to relieve his afflicted Friend from ſome bodily Pains, which 'twould be a Virtue in him to ſuffer with Patience and Reſignation.</p>
            <p>Others almoſt all Divines indeed agree, that it is and may be lawful to go to a Conjurer
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0180400100:346"/>
that torments another, and give him Money not to afflict the Patient any longer; becauſe that's only feeing him to deſiſt from acting after his conjuring manner.</p>
            <p>Theſe Premiſſes thus ſettled, if we allow the <hi>Second-Sight</hi> to be in-born and in-bred, and natural and common to ſome Families, which is proved in the Book; and if all that Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> has predicted in that Second-ſighted way terminates with moral Advice, and the Profit of the Conſulter, and without the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Juſtice to others, as the Book ſhews all throughout; if he can relieve from Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, as it ſeems Oath is to be had he can, which no one that deals in Black Art can do, why then I need not draw the Concluſion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Reader will do it naturally; they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow all the ſtricteſt Laws of Caſuiſtry and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality to be in favour of Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> and his Conſulters.</p>
