            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Curioſity of the Publick has been of late much engaged, in Enquiries after the NEW TRAGEDY of <hi>BARBA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROSSA,</hi> which is ſoon to be perform'd at the Theatre Royal in <hi>Drury-Lane;</hi> and as ſeveral Gentlemen of Eminence in the Republick of Letters have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0737305600:3"/>
as the Author, it may, perhaps, be agreeable to the Town, to have the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhort Account given of the previous Hiſtory of that fam'd Uſurper, from whom the Tragedy takes it's Name.</p>
            <p>While the memorable Cardinal XIMENEZ was Miniſter in <hi>Spain,</hi> King FERDINAND the Fifth, of <hi>Arragon,</hi> about the Year 1505, ſent PETER, Count of <hi>Navarre,</hi> with a powerful Force; which, without Difficulty, took <hi>Oran.</hi> The Inhabitants of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City in general were <hi>Moors,</hi> which had been forc'd out of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi> about twelve Years before.</p>
            <p>Theſe, being a bold and active People, and being well vers'd in the Manners, as well as Language of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> did conſiderable Damage, both by Sea and Land, to the Dependents of that Crown.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Oran</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> fluſh'd with Succeſs, purſu'd their Conqueſt and took <hi>Bugia,</hi> and many other Places, with heroic Valour. The <hi>Algerines,</hi> being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive their City would undergo the ſame Fate, ſent for Aſſiſtance, by Way of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to SELIM EUTEMI, a Prince of <hi>Arabian</hi> Extraction, famous for Skill in military Affairs. He accepted their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0737305600:4"/>
and came with a large Number of valiant Followers, which he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from that populous Nation, and encamp'd upon the Plain of <hi>Mutija,</hi> where he had Power; attended alſo by his Wife ZAPHIRA, a Lady of great Worth and Virtue, and his Son SELIM, not then twelve Years old, whom he was fond of initiating into the Exerciſe of War.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this Succour, another Fleet and more Troops from FERDINAND, quickly ſubdu'd the City of <hi>Algiers,</hi> and oblig'd it to pay Tribute; and even ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to build a Fort, and man it with ſome of the beſt Troops, on a ſmall Iſland, that lay oppoſite the City, to the great Injury of the <hi>Algerine Corſairs,</hi> who could not, with Safety, go out and in the Harbour.</p>
            <p>This, however diſagreeable, they bore with Patience, 'till the Death of FER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINAND in the Year 1516, which put them then upon an Attempt to recover their Liberties.</p>
            <p>They ſent Deputies to ARACH BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAROSSA, a <hi>Mahometan Corſair,</hi> born at <hi>Mcteline</hi> in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> of great Fame for his Bravery and his Succeſs in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0737305600:5"/>
Battle. He was upon a Cruiſe with his Squardron, when the <hi>Algerine</hi> Deputies met him, with their Requeſt to aſſiſt them to throw off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke; promiſing him great Dignities to his Perſon, and large Gratification for ſuch Service. He gave the Deputies a moſt favourable Anſwer, and ſent them back to <hi>Algiers,</hi> to carry Joy to their dejected Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>BARBAROSSA immediately ſent eighteen Gallies, and a Number of Barks to <hi>Algiers,</hi> while he march'd by Land, collecting all the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> that ſeem'd inclin'd to aſſiſt his Enterprize; and was ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his Levies, that the <hi>Algerines</hi> thought the Hour of Deliverance was at Hand.</p>
            <p>SELIM EUTEMI, General of <hi>Algiers,</hi> with many of the chief Officers and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Citizens, went two Days Journey to meet him; and brought him, with great Honours, in Triumph into their City, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him, amidſt the Shouts of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to the Palace of SELIM EUTEMI: Where he was nobly receiv'd, while his Army met with great Indulgence from the rejoic'd <hi>Algerines;</hi> which they ſoon abus'd, and claim'd by Force, what was firſt given them through Courteſy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0737305600:6"/>
BARBAROSSA too, being of an ambitious Nature, form'd a wicked Deſign of making himſelf Sovereign of <hi>Algiers,</hi> and all its Provinces. His Officers applauded his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, promis'd to aſſiſt in it, and ſwore themſelves to Secrecy, 'till a Time happen'd to put it in Execution. In order to begin Commotions, BARBAROSSA wink'd at the Inſolence and Villanies of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who were perpetually raiſing Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the City; which he hop'd might enrage the Citizens to ſome deſperate Act, that might favour his Deſign.</p>
            <p>SELIM EUTEMI now diſcover'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, in calling BARBAROSSA in to his Aſſiſtance: For, ſo inſolent was this Pirate, that he treated the Prince with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, never asking his Advice in any Thing; but built Forts, attack'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Caſtle, and all without his Knowledge or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>The Citizens too plainly perceiv'd his Deſign, and made no Scruple of declaring their Sentiments. BARBAROSSA, finding himſelf ſuſpected, gave Way to his Fury; which was heighten'd by a Paſſion he had entertain'd for SELIM's Wife, the fair ZAPHIRA. He therefore determin'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0737305600:7"/>
to make ſhort Work of it; and, by the Death of SELIM, ſatisfy at once his Ambition and his Love: For he did not doubt but upon her Husband's Death, ZAPHIRA would liſten to his Suit, and conſent to marry him; which Alliance would add Dignity to him, and his own mean Extraction be hid by the Union with this Lady, who was related to moſt of the powerful Cheques of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> who, if the <hi>Algerines</hi> ſhould oppoſe, would, for his Wife's ſake, aſſiſt to eſtabliſh him upon the Throne.</p>
            <p>BARBAROSSA, having fixt his Scheme, waited an Opportunity of SELIM's being alone in a Bath; when he ruſh'd upon him, and ſlew him. He fell down in the Bath, where the Water finiſh'd what his Hurry had imperfectly done. The Pirate haſten'd out, and, collecting ſome of his Friends, return'd to the Bath, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of cooling himſelf as uſual; where, with an affected Surprize, he ſhew'd SELIM dead. This was ſoon ſpread throughout the City; and BARBAROSSA, under Pretence of diſcovering any foul Play that might have been us'd to SELIM, put all the Soldiers under Arms, with Orders to ſecure every Paſs, 'till he could conſider further on this Accident.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0737305600:8"/>
The Citizens of <hi>Algiers,</hi> notwithſtanding the Reports given out, look'd upon the Death of SELIM to be a Stroke of the inhuman BARBAROSSA's; and, dreading the further Miſchief they ſuſpected he had plan'd, lock'd themſelves in their Houſes, which gave the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army full Power to diſtreſs and ſpoil at Pleaſure.—They immediately conducted BARBAROSSA in Pomp to SELIM's Palace, proclaiming him King of <hi>Algiers;</hi> adding, <hi>Deſtruction to all Oppoſers of him, that Heaven has choſen for our Deliverer and Protector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Menaces alarm'd the Citizens with moſt dreadful Apprehenſions. BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAROSSA was ſeated under a Canopy, ſurrounded with his Adherents and Guards, while proper Officers were ſent to the principal Inhabitants, requiring them, in the Name of the new King, to attend and take the Oath of Allegiance before him; promiſing great Marks of Favour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to thoſe, who ſhew'd themſelves moſt ready to perform the Ceremony. In this Exigency the Citizens, who apprehended immediate Death would follow their Refuſal, ſuffer'd themſelves to be brought to the Palace; where, after the King had repeated his magnificent Promiſes, they took the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0737305600:9"/>
Oaths, and ſign'd the Inſtrument for his Coronation.</p>
            <p>BARBAROSSA, having thus far obtain'd his End, order'd the Inhabitants to go quietly about their ſeveral Callings, and depend upon his Care for their Protection. Prince SELIM's Son, with Reaſon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending he was not long to ſurvive his Father's Murder, found Means to fly, with only two Servants to <hi>Oran,</hi> and beg Protection from <hi>Spain.</hi> The Marquis DE GOMAREZ, Governor of the Place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him with all the Reſpect and Honour due to his Birth and Youth.</p>
            <p>BARBAROSSA, being thus ſettled on the Throne, caus'd all the Fortifications of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> to be repair'd; and plac'd in them ſtrong Garriſons of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Soldiers, whom he paid well with Money he had coin'd in his own Name.</p>
            <p>The People ſoon felt the Grievances of BARBAROSSA's Uſurpation; for, where he had the leaſt Suſpicion, he ſeiz'd upon the Effects of the Subjects: Others, that had ſecreted their Money, were put to Death, while he and his Aſſociates revell'd in their Property.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0737305600:10"/>
While Affairs were in this Situation, BARBAROSSA began his Addreſſes to the Princeſs ZAPHIRA, who rejected them with the utmoſt Diſdain, for ſhe look'd upon him as the Murderer of her Husband; and expecting her Contempt of him would enrage him to attempt ſome Violence, ſhe always carry'd a Dagger with her; fully reſolv'd, if ſhe could not revenge herſelf on him, to ſave her Virtue at the Price of her own Life.</p>
            <p>BARBAROSSA, however furious by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did not immediately reſent ZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHIRA's Behaviour; but, looking on her exceſſive Grief to proceed from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Death, reſolv'd to forbear his Viſits for awhile, and let Time reſtore her Mind to Temper, when he did not doubt but to perſwade her to ſhare his Crown.—He made her a Preſent of ſome beautiful Slaves, ſome of which were inſtructed to let him know what paſs'd in the Princeſs's Apartment.</p>
            <p>ZAPHIRA's Grief was too violent to continue, and her Tranſports began to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into a compos'd and ſilent Sorrow. Reflection took Place, and, finding it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0737305600:11"/>
to revenge the Death of SELIM, ſhe reſolv'd to requeſt the Uſurper to let her retire into her own Country.</p>
            <p>BARBAROSSA, hearing the Princeſs was grown more moderate in her Grief, ſent her a Letter, full of the higheſt Praiſes of her Beauty, and the Adoration he paid to it; offering to ſhare his Crown with her, and beſeeching her to forget all former Miſeries, and riſe to Joy upon the Throne he wiſh'd her to adorn.</p>
            <p>One of the Slaves, that BARBAROSSA had preſented the Princeſs with, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to deliver this Letter to her; but what was her Surprize, when ſhe read theſe Offers made by one who was the Murderer of her Husband? All her former Agitations were renew'd; but at length, a little recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting herſelf, ſhe conſulted with her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Women how to behave in ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Exigency. It was now reſolv'd, that ſhe ſhould ſend a ſoothing Anſwer back (as Rage would prove vain againſt Power) and, by flattering the Tyrant, obtain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to retire to the Plains of <hi>Mutija</hi> her native Country; and urge, for Reaſon of her refuſing the Crown, her Deteſtatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Place where her Lord was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0737305600:12"/>
BARBAROSSA found, by this Epiſtle, that ſhe ſuſpected him as Acceſſary to SELIM's Death; but, in order to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and put an End to ZAPHIRA's Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, he ſummon'd his chief Counſellor and Inſtrument in the Death of SELIM, RAMADAN CHOULAH, and told him, As the Princeſs ſuſpected he was concern'd in the Prince's Murder, that, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf, he muſt procure ſome Victims to turn ZAPHIRA's Thoughts.</p>
            <p>RAMADAN eaſily came into this Project; and order'd it to be proclaim'd, That the King, being inform'd that SELIM had a violent Death, and that he himſelf was ſuſpected to be privy to it, his Orders were that any Perſon who knew, or ſuſpected the Murderers, ſhould immediately diſcover them, on Pain of Death and Tortures; promiſing, at the ſame Time, great Rewards to the Informer.</p>
            <p>It was not long before an Informer, who had been practis'd upon, made a Diſcovery. He declar'd, That a Domeſtic of Prince SELIM's had told him, before he left <hi>Algiers,</hi> the Names of the Accomplices; adding, that they were under an Oath to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0737305600:13"/>
ſuffer Death, rather than betray the Secret, if BARBAROSSA had miſcarried; but that he being at preſent the Sovereign, they had nothing to fear, though it ſhould be publickly known. This Wretch, who was in the Prince's Service, receiv'd the Reward; but, at the ſame Time, the King order'd his Tongue to be pull'd out, under Pretence of his not revealing it ſooner, but indeed that he might not diſcover the Treachery.</p>
            <p>The pretended Accomplices, to the Number of Thirty, were brought before the King, who were ſome of the pooreſt Soldiers in BARBAROSSA's Army; and had been wrought upon by RAMADAN, in order to clear the King, publickly to conſeſs themſelves guilty, aſſuring them of great Rewards for the Service; and tho' they ſhould be put in Priſon, yet Means ſhould be found to convey them ſafe to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to ſpend their Lives in Peace and Plenty.</p>
            <p>Theſe poor Men could not reſiſt ſuch Promiſes, but conſented; and, when they were call'd upon, anſwer'd to every Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and own'd their Guilt, upon which they were immediately ſtrangled. One of them, out of Revenge to RAMADAN, who

had ſo deluded them, cry'd out before he dy'd, <hi>That Prince</hi> SELIM <hi>was murder'd, by the Order of</hi> RAMADAN; whom the King order'd that Inſtant to meet the ſame Fate, the other Wretches had ſuffer'd. Thus did this wicked Man fall by his own Contrivance, and was deſtroy'd by that Power which he had been the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>BARBAROSSA had the Bodies of theſe Wretches drag'd round the City, and their Heads fixt upon the Battlements of the Palace; and did not doubt, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of theſe Criminals would convince ZAPHIRA, as well as all the Citizens, that he was innocent of Prince SELIM's Death: And, indeed, many acquitted him of being any Ways concern'd in the Murder.</p>
            <p>With this Aſſurance, he ſent again to the Princeſs, again invited her to his Throne; and pleaded, as ſome Merit, the Diſcovery he had made of SELIM's Murderers, and the Juſtice he had executed upon them.</p>
            <p>But ZAPHIRA was too penetrating to be ſo deceiv'd. She again refus'd his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0737305600:15"/>
Offers; adding, His Power could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow any Thing worth her Acceptance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was the Liberty of retiring to her own Country.</p>
            <p>This Intercourſe of aſſiduous Courtſhip and ſteady Refuſal, continu'd by Fits for ſome Years; during which Time, BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAROSSA was frequently call'd from <hi>Algiers</hi> by his Ambition, in defending the Territories he had uſurped, and inlarging them by new Conqueſts. In the mean Time, having got Notice that young SELIM had taken Refuge in <hi>Oran,</hi> he ſecretly diſpatch'd a bold Aſſaſſin, who ſhould deſtroy the young Prince, whom he regarded as the greateſt Obſtacle to his ſafe Poſſeſſion of the Throne.</p>
            <p>While this Deſign was in Agitation he return'd triumphant over his Enemies to <hi>Algiers,</hi> and, being at once tired and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked with ZAPHIRA's repeated Delays, he now bethought himſelf of uſing that Power he was poſſeſſed of; and reſolved, in Caſe of another Refuſal, to compel her to a Marriage.</p>

How the Poet may conduct his Plan, or what Uſe he may make of theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, we preſume not to conjecture: Nor indeed, if we were acquainted with his Deſign, would we anticipate the Spectator's Pleaſure, by making it publick—But, by the Policy of the Managers, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this Tragedy is as much a Secret, as either the Name of the Author, or the ſubſequent Part of the Hiſtory itſelf.</p>
