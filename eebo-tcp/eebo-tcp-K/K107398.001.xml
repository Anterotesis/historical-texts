            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here preſent the Reader with a Volume of Letters writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very different Occaſions, at very different Times. They are far from being all of them equal, but I hope their Variety will make amends for their Inequality. I make no doubt but that upon peruſal of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical part of them, the old Accuſation will be brought againſt me, and there will be a freſh Outcry among Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs People, that I am an Ill-natur'd Man. 'Tis very odd that I ſhould have that Character only from Perſons who never knew me, and who never were once in my Company. But there are People in the World who imagine that Criticiſm muſt be the Effect of Ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe Perſons know not what is meant by either of the Terms, either
<pb facs="tcp:0826500101:5"/>
Criticiſm or Ill-nature; otherwiſe they would be convinced that a good Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm is the beſt-natur'd thing in the World. For by Goodneſs of Nature muſt be meant ſomething that comes up to the true Nature of Man; elſe it would be a Term of Reproach, inſtead of Commendation. But the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man is a Reaſonable and a Social Nature. And a good Criticiſm, is both Reaſonable and Social. It detects Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, illuſtrates Truth, advances Art, and conſequently has a direct Tendency to the Advancement of the national Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. If this laſt is true of good Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm in general, it muſt be moſt true of a juſt Criticiſm upon the Tragedy of <hi>Cato.</hi> That Tragedy met with Succeſs which never any other did. It was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a Month together. It has been tranſlated into <hi>French,</hi> and into <hi>Italian,</hi> which never happen'd to any of our Dramatick Poems before. And 'tis plain to all the Judges of Poetry, that it has a Thouſand ſhameful Faults, and very
<pb facs="tcp:0826500101:6"/>
few natural Beauties. What muſt the Knowers in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> ſay, upon reading theſe Tranſlations? Muſt they not Diſcourſe after this Manner? The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation boaſt much of their Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; they extol to the Skies, their <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> their <hi>Ben Johnſon,</hi> their <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>: But yet they applaud nothing ſo loudly as this Tragedy of <hi>Cato.</hi> They have got it tranſlated both into <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> and have ſent it to us as a Maſter-Piece to Inſult us. Elſe why has this Tragedy only been tranſlated? And yet this Tragedy, at the ſame time that it has a Thouſand Faults, and moſt of them very groſs ones; has very few Beauties, and thoſe which it has are perhaps not of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Growth, but are deriv'd from <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> and <hi>Seneca.</hi> What then muſt we think of thoſe other Poets, their <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear,</hi> their <hi>Ben Johnſon,</hi> their <hi>Milton,</hi> whom they formerly ſo much extol'd, but not half ſo much as <hi>Cato?</hi> Muſt we not conclude, that theſe Iſlanders are
<pb facs="tcp:0826500101:7"/>
very indifferent Poets, and more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Judges?</p>
            <p>I appeal to the reaſonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader, if this muſt not be the Senſe of all the knowing <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> who have ſeen theſe Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Let the reaſonable and impartial Reader judge then, if a juſt Criticiſm upon <hi>Cato</hi> was not abſolutely neceſſary, both for the Advantage of Dramatick Poetry, to which the undeſerv'd Succeſs of this Tragedy has done infinite Harm, and for the Vindication of the National Honour; let the Reader judge, if it was not neceſſary, that a Man who owns that he admires the noble Genius of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> admires the unparallell'd Sublimity of the <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that he is infinitely pleas'd with the Maſter-Pieces of <hi>Ben Johnſon,</hi> and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly delighted with ſeveral of our other Comick Poets, ſhould give his Reaſons to all the World why he has no Eſteem for <hi>Cato?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0826500101:8"/>
If what I have ſaid is not ſufficient to appeaſe the Fury of a Headlong Cabal; but they will ſtill cry out that the Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Letters in this Volume upon the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of <hi>Cato,</hi> are the Effects of Ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I muſt beg leave to exclaim in my turn, that thoſe Perſons, let them be who they will, ſhew a deplorable want of publick Spirit, who can prefer the Reputation of one Man, and a Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he does not deſerve to poſſeſs, before the Advantage of a noble Art, and the Honour of their Country.</p>
            <p>But perhaps 'tis not the Author of <hi>Cato</hi> that theſe Perſons are ſo much concern'd for, 'tis themſelves. 'Tis themſelves and their own Satisfaction, which they prefer to the Proſperity of the Commonwealth of Learning, and to the Good and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Country. There are in the World very vain Perſons, who are reſolv'd to maintain the good Opinion which they have of themſelves, at the Expence of every thing, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb facs="tcp:0826500101:9"/>
the Man who ſhall dare to diſturb them in the Poſſeſſion of it, by ſhewing them that they have paſs'd a very fooliſh Judgment.</p>
            <p>If any are diſguſted that theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations are publiſh'd after the Death of the Author of that Tragedy, I can aſſure them, that they were writ in two long Letters to a Friend immediately after the REMARKS which were printed. By what Artifice thoſe two Letters were got out of my Hands, by what Fortune I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Subſtance of them, and how it came to take the form which it now has, I ſhall not here declare; not the firſt, thro' regard to the Memory of the Dead; nor the two latter, thro' Reſpect to the precious Time of the Living.</p>
            <p>Before I take my leave of this Subject I think my ſelf oblig'd to do Juſtice to the Memory of Mr. ADDISON, who was certainly a Learned and very Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man: And ſeveral of the <hi>Tatlers</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0826500101:10"/>
and <hi>Spectators</hi> which were writ by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Applauſe which they met with.</p>
            <p>I hope that what I have ſaid will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſatisfy every reaſonable Impartial Reader, who is a true Lover of His Country. For the reſt, I have long ſince learnt to eſteem their Cenſures according to their juſt Value.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I ſent you my Obſervations, upon the Two firſt Acts of the Play, I ſent you ſo many Reaſons which oblig'd me to differ from you, with reſpect to the Encomium, which you give to that Tragedy, in your <hi>Eſſay</hi> upon <hi>Epick Poetry.</hi> And whenever you think fit to lay your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon me, I ſhall lay before you the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for which I diſſent from you, with regard to the Commendation which you give to a <hi>late Tranſlation.</hi> At preſent I ſhall paſs to Things more general, and conſequently of far great Importance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0826500101:16"/>
IN the Chapter which treats of the Moral, you are pleaſed to affirm two Things; The firſt is, That one who writes an Epick Poem, need not in his firſt Intention, pitch upon ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Moral, and then contrive his Fable ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Deſign; The Second Thing is, That there is no occaſion that an Epick Poem ſhould end Fortunately with regard to the Principal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>BUT, Sir, before I give my Reaſons for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from you, with regard to theſe Two Points; the firſt of which is of Conſequence, and the Second of the utmoſt Importance: I deſire that you would give me leave to enumerate ſome Things, in which we perfectly Agree; that by this Method, we may facilitate an Agreement in Things in which we Differ.</p>
            <p>We agree then, Sir, in the following Points.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That there muſt be a Fable. <hi>Eſſay.</hi> p. 37.</item>
               <item>2. That there muſt be an Action. <hi>Eſſ.</hi> p. 47.</item>
               <item>3. That the Action muſt be one. p. <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. That there muſt be a Moral. p. 76.</item>
               <item>5. That the Fable and the Action muſt be only for the Moral. <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; p. 34.</item>
               <item>6. That the Moral muſt be the genuine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the Fable and the Action. p. 77.</item>
               <item>7. That Admiration ought to be the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Paſſion in the narration of the Action. p. 33.</item>
               <item>8. Nothing that is common or ordinary, can excite Admiration. p. 34 &amp; 35.</item>
               <item>9. That there ought to be an Allegory. p. 41.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0826500101:17"/>
THESE, Sir, are Things in which we agree ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly: There are other Things in which we agree implicitly, becauſe if theſe laſt are falſe, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Truth even of thoſe in which we agree expreſly; as that</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Moral muſt contain an undeniable Truth, or elſe it cannot be a Moral: For Falſhood may delude, but only Truth can inſtruct.</item>
               <item>2. That the Inſtruction which the Poem gives, muſt be general; Moral Philoſophy being the Law of Nature, and conſequently, inſtructive to Mankind.</item>
               <item>3. That the Poetick Action muſt remain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, even after the Impoſition of Names; for if the Action is particular, there can be no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Inſtruction deduced from it; the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being falſe to generals from particulars.</item>
               <item>4. That for the ſame Reaſon, the Characters at the bottom muſt be general likewiſe, even after the Impoſition of Names.</item>
               <item>5. That the Action and Characters being both general, even after the Impoſition of Names, they muſt be, conſequently, both Allegorical.</item>
            </list>
            <p>LET us come now, Sir, to the two foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Particulars.</p>
            <p>YOU ſay, That an Epick Poet is not oblig'd to have the Moral firſt in his Mind: For, ſay you, no Author can form the Narration of any great and memorable Action, but ſome Moral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0826500101:18"/>
will ariſe from it, whether the Writer intends it or not. Suppoſe this were true, a Poet is to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct by his Art and not by Chance. But the very contrary of this is true, a Poet may form the Narration, of a Hundred great and memorable Actions, if theſe Actions are Particular and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical, and not one Moral ſhall ariſe from them all; as the Battle of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> the Death of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> the Death of <hi>Cato,</hi> the Death of King <hi>Lear,</hi> the Death of <hi>Hamlet,</hi> the Death of <hi>Harry</hi> the Fourth: And I defie any Poet to form a general Action, and general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, but he muſt form them upon a Moral, and conſequently that Moral muſt be firſt in his Head. Can any one believe, that <hi>Aeſop</hi> firſt told a Story of a Cock and a Bull, and afterwards made a Moral to it? Or is it reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he made his Moral firſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to prove it, contriv'd his Fable? Now I know no difference that there is, between one of <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fables, and the Fable of an Epick Poem, as to their Natures, tho' there be many and great ones, as to their Circumſtances. 'Tis impoſſible for a Poet to form any Fable, unleſs the Moral be firſt in his Head.</p>
            <p>YOU ſay that ſince <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> does not expreſly draw any Doctrine from their Fables, it is not certain whether they deſign'd any; and it is ſtill more uncertain, you ſay, whether they intended thoſe particular Morals, which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally aſcrib'd to them; which is as much as to ſay, that, tho' we can ſee a Deſign, a good, a juſt, and a great Deſign in thoſe admirable Poems,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0826500101:19"/>
yet the Authors of them ſaw none, and that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that is not their Deſign, which appears to us and others, but ſomething, which after ſo many Ages, has appeared to no Man. Could <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil,</hi> if they had ſtudied a Thouſand Years, have contrived Morals, which would have been more the genuine reſult of all the Parts of their Fables and of their Actions, than thoſe which are generally aſcribed to them? Or can thoſe Morals be made to appear the genuine reſult of any other Poetick Actions, unleſs they are Copies of thoſe?</p>
            <p>YOU continue to ſay, That as from Pulpit Diſcourſes on Divine Subjects, many uſeful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences may be deduc'd by the Preacher; ſo in theſe ſuperior Poems, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here, Sir, you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not to conſider, that the grand Moral of every Sermon is the Text, which certainly is, or ought to be, firſt in the Mind of every Preacher.</p>
            <p>TO conclude my Remarks on this firſt Point; it appears to me evident, that every Man who undertakes any great Action, has the chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which he propoſes by it, firſt of all in his Head; but you yourſelf are pleaſed to own, p. 34. <hi>That the principal End of an Epick Poet, is to give Pleaſure and Inſtruction</hi>; and p. 76. <hi>That the Pleaſure is only in order to the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>; and p. 77. <hi>That the moſt important part of the Inſtruction ought to ariſe from the whole Fable, becauſe the Inſtruction that ariſes from the whole, muſt be more important than that which ariſes from the Parts.</hi> By owning all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0826500101:20"/>
which, it is clear to me that you implicitly own, That the Moral of an Epick Poem muſt be firſt in the Head of the Poet.</p>
            <p>I now, Sir, come to the Second Point, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we differ. You are pleas'd to affirm, That it is not neceſſary, that an Epick Poem ſhould end happily, with relation to the Principal Character, but that the Poets and mere Criticks have laid down this Rule, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Reaſon in the Caſe, being led into it by the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſes</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the <hi>Aeneis</hi> of <hi>Virgil:</hi> And here you deplore that ſervile Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which the Poets and Commentators have made to naked Anthority, by which they have advanc'd Maxims out of Reverence to great Names, without any Diſcuſſion of the Subject, or entering upon any Enquiry which ſupports their Aſſertion; becauſe, ſay you, the End of the Epick Poet may be equally attain'd, tho' the Event ſhould be Unfortunate; into which we are now to Enquire.</p>
            <p>THE principal Character of an Epick Poem, muſt be either morally good or morally vicious; if he is morally good, the making him end un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, will deſtroy all Poetical Juſtice, and conſequently, all Inſtruction: Such a Poem can have no Moral, and conſequently no Fable, no juſt and regular Poetical Action, but muſt be a vain Fiction and an empty Amuſement. Oh, but there is a Retribution in Futurity! But I thought that the Reader of an Epick Poem was to owe his Inſtruction to the Poet, and not to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0826500101:21"/>
himſelf: Well then, the Poet may tell him ſo at the latter end of his Poem: Ay, would to God I could ſee ſuch a latter End of an Epick Poem, where the Poet ſhould tell the Reader, that he has cut an honeſt Man's Throat, only that he may have an Opportunity to ſend him to Heaven; and that tho' this would be but an indifferent Plea upon an Indictment for Murder at the Old-Baily, yet that he hopes the good-natur'd Reader will have Compaſſion on him, as the Gods have on his Hero. But Raillery apart, Sir, What occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is there for having recourſe to an Epick Poet to tell our ſelves by the bye, and by occaſional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that there will be a Retribution in Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when the Chriſtian has this in his Heart conſtantly and directly, and the Atheiſt and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinker will make no ſuch Reflection? Tell me truly, Sir, would not ſuch a Poet appear to you or me, not to have ſufficiently conſider'd what a Poetical Moral is? And ſhould not you, or I Sir, be oblig'd, in order to make him comprehend the Nature of it, to lay before him that univerſal Moral, which is the Foundation of all Morals, both Epick and Dramatick, and is incluſive of them all, and that is, That He who does good, and perſeveres in it, ſhall always be Rewarded, and he who does ill and perſeveres in it, ſhall always be puniſh'd? Should we not deſire him to obſerve, That the foreſaid Reward muſt always attend and crown good Actions, not ſometimes only, for then it would follow, that ſometimes a perſeverance in good Actions has no Reward, which would take away all Poetical Inſtruction,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0826500101:22"/>
and indeed every ſort of Moral Inſtruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving Providence into Chance or Fate. Should we not, Sir, farther put him in Mind, that ſince whoever perſeveres in good Actions, is ſure to be Rewarded at the laſt, it follows, that a Poet does not aſſert by his Moral, that he is always ſure to be Rewarded in this World, becauſe that would be falſe, as you have very juſtly obſerv'd, <hi>p.</hi> 60. and therefore never can be the Moral of an Epick Poem, becauſe what is falſe may De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, but only Truth can Inſtruct. Should we not let him know, Sir, that this univerſal Moral only teaches us, That whoever perſeveres in good Actions, ſhall be always ſure to be Rewarded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here or hereafter; and that the Truth of this Moral is prov'd by the Poet, by making the principal Character of his Poem, like all the reſt of his Characters, and like the Poetical Action, at the bottom, Univerſal and Allegorical, even after diſtinguiſhing it by a particular Name, by making this principal Character at the bottom, a meer Poetical Phantom, of a very ſhort du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, thro' the whole extent of which duration we can ſee at once, which continues no longer than the reading of the Poem, and that being over, the Phantom is to us nothing, ſo that unleſs our Senſe is ſatisfy'd of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that is given to this Poetical Phantome, whoſe whole duration we ſee thro' from the very beginning to the end; inſtead of a wholſome Moral, there would be a pernicious Inſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man may perſevere in good Actions and not be Rewarded for it thro' the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0826500101:23"/>
of his duration, that is neither in this World nor in the World to come.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' the principal Character of an Epick Poem is morally vicious, yet the Poem ought not to end unfortunately with relation to that principal Character. But here, Sir, I think my ſelf oblig'd to explain my ſelf: By a Character morally vicious, I by no means mean a Villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Character: Becauſe a Villain can never have greatneſs of Mind nor greatneſs of Capacity ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to perform Things deſerving to be admir'd. But Admiration is, as it were, the Inſtrument by which the Poet works his End, which is Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as has been acknowledg'd.</p>
            <p>BY a Character morally vicious then, I mean ſuch a Character as is compounded of good and bad Qualities, the good at the ſame time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the bad, and Hiding them as the Sun does Mercury, by the greatneſs of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Luſtre: Now a Poet is not to make an Heroick Poem end Unfortunately, with relation to ſuch a Character, becauſe ſuch an end would weaken and deſtroy that Admiration which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the Poet's attaining his End, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy or weaken it in the very place where its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is moſt requiſite. For as the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that a Poem is to make, ought to be made at the end of it, the reigning Paſſion of that Poem ought to predominate moſt there. As therefore Terrour and Compaſſion ought to be moſt violently mov'd, at the Cataſtrophe of a Tragedy, and Laughter at that of a Comedy, Admiration ought to be rais'd to its utmoſt height,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0826500101:24"/>
at the end of an Epick Poem. But if that Poem ſhould end unfortunately, with relation to ſuch a compounded Character, as we have juſt mention'd above, it would cauſe great Indignation in ſome, and great Compaſſion in others: Now as great Indignation and great Compaſſion are always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Grief, Admiration is conſtantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Joy. An Epick Poet therefore, by exciting Compaſſion or Indignation at the latter end of his Poem, inſtead of Admiration, would make that Poem throw off its Nature and aſſume that of Tragedy, which is as directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its own, as Grief is to Joy, or as Light is to Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>NOR would ſuch a proſperous End, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch a Character, be in the leaſt a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Poetick Juſtice, tho' for the moſt part in Tragedy, it would be a very great one; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Hero of an Epick Poem always carries on ſome good and great Deſign, for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of that Society, of which he is the chief, or an illuſtrious Member, at leaſt, it has been ſo, in all the Epick Poems I have yet ſeen; tho' this is far from being always the Caſe in Tragedy; now that publick Virtue makes Compenſation for all Faults but Crimes, and he who has this publick Virtue is not capable of Crimes. The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> while Liberty flouriſh'd among them, would have look'd very coldly upon a Poet, who ſhould have ſhewn a great Patriot unfortunate, only for being a great Patriot. In order to encourage publick Virtue and publick Spirit, and the Love of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0826500101:25"/>
they oblig'd their Epick Poets, to ſhew thoſe Virtues crown'd with Glory and Felicity. Nay, the Ancients made the very future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Heroes depend upon the Succeſs of their good and great Deſigns for the Welfare of their Country: Witneſs that famous paſſage in the Fragment of <hi>Cicero, De ſomnio Ciceronis Sed, quo ſis, Africane, alacrior. ad Tutandam Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicam, ſic Habeto: Oomnibus, qui patriam conſervaverint, adjuverint, auxerint, certum eſſe in caelo, ac Definitum locum, ubi Beati aevo ſempiterno fruantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR my part, I have no Notion, that a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Hero can be proper for Epick Poetry. <hi>Milton</hi> could make but very little, even of a Suffering God, who makes quite another Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion with his Lightning and his Thunder in <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> than with his Meckneſs and his Stoiciſm in <hi>Paradiſe Regain'd</hi>: That great Spirit which Heroick Poetry requires, flows from great Paſſions and from great Actions: If the ſuffering Hero remains inſenſible the generality of Readers will not be much concern'd for one, who is ſo little concern'd for himſelf. The Greatneſs of his Mind may, perhaps, be admir'd by a few, who are themſelves magnanimous, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of an Epick Poem ought to write to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and not only to the Age wherein he lives, but to remoteſt Poſterity. If the Hero of an Epick Poem ſhould not appear inſenſible in his Sufferings, his Senſibility will be attended with Paſſions, which are not only incompatible with that Admiration, which ought to be mov'd thro

            <p>LET us then, Sir, leave the Virtues of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long Suffering to be taught by Prieſts: They will not fail to inculcate ſuch Doctrines fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as being at once conſiſtent with their Duty and their Craft: But never fear that they will intrench upon your Province, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend publick Virtue and publick Spirit, and the Love of their Country, to a People, whom they have ſhewn too clearly, that 'tis their Deſign to enſlave. But for your part, Sir, that you may deſerve more and more of your Country and of Mankind, make Choice of a Hero, whoſe every Action may flow from thoſe noble Principles, and Reform a degenerate Age, which ſeems ſo fond of Slavery. Let his great Actions be crown'd with Glory and Victory, with the Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acclamations of the People, whom he has made happy by his Heroick Conduct and Virtue, and with ſuch tranſcendent Felicity, as may raiſe the higheſt Admiration in the Breaſt of every Reader, inflame every one of them with the love of his Country, and with a burning Zeal to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate what he admires.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I had the favour of a Viſit from you the other Day, I was in a great deal of Pain, and had been ſo for a Day and a Night before you ſaw me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo for the ſame ſpace of Time after you left me, and then I voided a Stone about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Pea, and ſo thanks be to God, have been ever ſince at Eaſe.</p>
            <p>BUT what perhaps may ſurprize you, is this, That in the midſt of all this Miſery, I read over four Comedies of <hi>Terence, viz.</hi> The <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the <hi>Heautontimorumenos,</hi> the <hi>Adelphi,</hi> and the <hi>Phormio.</hi> Theſe I read over in the two Evenings ofmy Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Quarto Edition, a very convenient one for a Perſon of my gravity, in a Winter's Evening, tho' he who had the Care of the Edition, underſtood nothing of the Stage. In
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0826500101:28"/>
the two Mornings of my Illneſs, I read over Mrs <hi>Dacier</hi>'s Comment upon the Four Comedies, and upon the Life of <hi>Terence</hi> writ by <hi>Suetonius.</hi> I have told you more than once, that when the Commentators had ſometimes led me into a Bog, my own Common Senſe had help'd to guide me out again. You may gueſs what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I pay to the Herd of Commentators, when you will ſee by what follows, that I have the Aſſurance to contradict Monſieur <hi>Le Fevre</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Dacier</hi> his Daughter, for whoſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Judgment, and fine Diſcernment I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had a ſingular Regard and Eſteem.</p>
            <p>YOU know very well, Sir, that <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the latter end of his Life of <hi>Terence,</hi> has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd ſome Verſes of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> in which that Emperor calls <hi>Terence</hi> a Demy <hi>Menander,</hi> and complains that the <hi>Vis Comica</hi> was wanting to that Comick Poet.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Dacier</hi> in her Remarks upon that part of the Life, ſays, That it was the Opinion of her Father Monſieur <hi>Le Fevre,</hi> that by the <hi>Vis Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica, Caeſar</hi> meant the Paſſions, from which Opinion the Daughter diſſents for the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0826500101:29"/>
Reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe the Paſſions are natural and eſſential to Tragedy, and but inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental to Comedy. Secondly, Becauſe it is impoſſible to preſerve the Characters, as <hi>Terence</hi> has admirably done, without making them Speak upon occaſion with as much Paſſion as that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires; which is not only juſtly, but very finely obſerv'd. And, Indeed we find that the Paſſions in <hi>Terence,</hi> upon great ſurprizes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream lively and ſtrong. And when <hi>Horace</hi> tells us in his Art of Poetry, that Comedy ſometimes uſurps upon Tragedy, and has Paſſions which are next to Tragical, He brings his Example from the <hi>Heautontimorumenos</hi> of <hi>Terence.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Interdum tamen, &amp; vocem Comoedia tellit,</l>
               <l>Iratusque Chremes tumido Delitigat ore.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But the Explication which Mrs. <hi>Dacier</hi> her Self, gives of the Words of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> is not a jot better than her Father's. For by <hi>Vis Comica,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>Caeſar</hi> meant the Vivacity of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the tying and ſolving the Knot of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue; which is wrong, for two Reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe theſe both belong to Tragedy as nearly as they do to Comedy. And, Secondly, Becauſe, if <hi>Caeſar</hi> had underſtood by his <hi>Vis Comica,</hi> what Mrs. <hi>Dacier</hi> thinks he did, he could never have call'd <hi>Terence</hi> a Demy <hi>Menander.</hi> For <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> having the Buſineſs of two of <hi>Menander's</hi> Comedies in one of his, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Comedy being of as great a length as the <hi>Roman</hi>; <hi>Terence</hi> muſt conſequently have more Intrigue, and a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0826500101:30"/>
greater Vivacity of Action than <hi>Menander,</hi> and conſequently, if <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by his <hi>Vis Comica,</hi> had meant the Intrigue, and the vivacity of Action, He would have nominated <hi>Terence,</hi> a Double, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Demy <hi>Menander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince I have Declared my ſelf not at all ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with either the Father's or the Daughter's Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, you may perhaps expect that I ſhould give my own. I ſhall do it with Submiſſion, but upon this Condition, that if I am in the wrong, you and your Commentators ſhall ſet me right.</p>
            <p>I am apt to believe both from the Terms, and the Reaſon of the Thing, that by the <hi>Vis Comica,</hi> muſt be meant ſomething Comical and peculiar to Comedy. For the chief Force of any kind of Poem, muſt conſiſt in that which makes the Characteriſtick of it, and which diſtinguiſhes it from all other Poems. As the chief Force of Tragedy muſt proceed from the moving Compaſſion and Terror ſtrongly, and the Chief Force of Epick Poetry from the exciting Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Powerfully, ſo the chief Force of Comedy muſt conſiſt in exciting Laughter. By the <hi>Vis Comica,</hi> then can never be meant the bare Vivacity of the Action, and the tying and ſolving the Knot of the Intrigue, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both kinds of Dramatick Poetry, as has been obſerv'd above, but the lively Ridicule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the Intrigue; the Ridicule of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and eſpecially of the Cataſtrophe, which yet is but a part of the <hi>Vis Comica,</hi> for there is likewiſe the Ridicule of the Characters proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their ſeveral Humours, and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0826500101:31"/>
of the Sentiments and of the Dialogue. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> therefore ſays, that <hi>Terence</hi> is but a Demy <hi>Menander,</hi> what does he ſay, but that <hi>Terence</hi> had turn'd four or five of <hi>Menander</hi>'s Comedies into Latin, and loſt half the Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule and the Pleaſantry of that <hi>Athenian</hi> Poet, in Tranſlating him. That this was <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Meaning is plain to me, not only from the Reaſon and the Nature of the Thing, which has been ſhewn above, but from the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which <hi>Caeſar</hi> took in the <hi>Ridiculum,</hi> and the great Encouragement which he gave to the <hi>Mimes</hi> of <hi>Laberius</hi> and <hi>Publius Syrus,</hi> which were low Farces, compos'd on purpoſe only to make People Laugh; as likewiſe from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which <hi>Terence</hi> took in his Verſions: For taking two of <hi>Menander</hi>'s Plays into one of his, he muſt of Neceſſity leave a great part of his Dialogue behind him, and by conſequence, a great part of his Pleaſantry: So that the ſame thing happen'd to <hi>Menander</hi> formerly, which has befallen <hi>Moliere</hi> in our Days. Several <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Authors have tranſlated Parts of him, but not one of them has enter'd into that <hi>naiueté</hi> which is the pureſt Source of his Pleaſantry, (as indeed it is of Pleaſantry in general) for what the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>naiueté,</hi> which is a charming Simplicity, dictated by pure Nature, is almoſt always Original: For there is ſomething in it ſo eaſie, ſo free, ſo flowing and ſo natural, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies the reſtraint of a Copy. I do not pretend to ſay, that there was none of the <hi>naiueté</hi> of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0826500101:32"/>
               <hi>Menander</hi> in <hi>Terence</hi>; but I may venture to ſay after <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that there is not above half of it, and conſequently, not above half his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry; tho' at the ſame time, I believe that there is more of this Quality in <hi>Terence,</hi> than ever there was in a Copy; and if the God of Laughter does not always attend upon <hi>Terence, Venus</hi> and the <hi>Graces</hi> never leave him. 'Tis my humble Opinion, that there is no Dialogue extant in any Language, which has half the Charms of the <hi>Terentian</hi> Dialogue; what comes neareſt to it, is that of <hi>Etherege</hi> in Sir <hi>Fopling Flutter.</hi> I, who have been acquainted with <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> above forty Years, am now more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him than ever: And ſure that Beauty muſt be no common Charmer, in whom Time ſhall diſcover new Graces, and whom long poſſeſſion, renders more deſireable.</p>
            <p>THUS have I given you my Sentiments: If what I take to be the Senſe of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> be not your own, I deſire you would ſet me right.</p>

            <p>SINCE I had the Honour to play the Fool before your Grace here, it has been my Misfortune in the ſame Place to Act a very Melancholy Part, for which your Grace knows very well that Nature has not adapted me; and for which, I can aſſure your Grace, that I have not the leaſt Inclination.

            <p>BUT while I was thus between Life and Death, and in ſore Tribulation, my old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron came to me by Night, at the Time when he diſappeared to all the other Mortals of this Hemiſphere? and giving me a ſwinging lug by the Ear, that has made one ſide of my Head Sore ever ſince, <hi>Pinky</hi> quoth he, be of good Cheer, I have found a way to free thee from all thy Troubles.

            <p>I Sent a Letter on the 28th to your Houſe, Directed to Captain <hi>Steele,</hi> and deſiring to ſee himthat Night, that I might have his Advice upon a Buſineſs of Importance, ſoftly intimating at the ſame Time, that it was not in my Power to wait upon him. But having neither ſeen him nor heard from him, I fancy that my old Friend is departed, and ſome Gentleman has ſucceeded him in the old Houſe, with the ſame Name, and the ſame Martial Title; a Chance that happens oftener in the World than ſome People ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. How ſhould I have been ſurpriz'd, in Caſe I had gone my ſelf, expecting from the Similitude of Name and Title, to have ſeen my old Acquaintance? How ſhould I have been ſurpriz'd to have found a Man with quite another Mind, and quite another Countenance? My old Friend, as I thought at leaſt, had Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, had Humanity, had a good and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0826500101:43"/>
Officiouſneſs, and as I did not take him to want good Nature, ſo he had what the <hi>French</hi> call a good Countenance, that is, the Countenance of one who is pleas'd with him who talks to him. But I ſuppoſe I ſhould have found nothing of all this in the noble Captain who ſucceeds him. You will ſay, perhaps, that you had no Reaſon to make a Viſit to one whom you know not, and are reſolved not to know. But then, Noble Captain, you ought to have ſent back my Letter, and to have given me to underſtand, that you are not the Perſon that I took you for; that you ſhould have enough to do, if you were obliged to own all the Acquaintance of the Captain, your Predeceſſor; That I am not the firſt Man who have made this Miſtake, and ſhall not probably be the laſt. Had you done this, I had had no Replication to make to ſo equitable an Anſwer. I ſhould only perhaps have advis'd you, in order to the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome troubleſome Viſits, and ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Letters, to cauſe an Advertiſement to be inſerted in Squire <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi>'s next <hi>Lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations,</hi> by which the World might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, That the Captain <hi>Steele,</hi> who lives now in <hi>Bury-Street,</hi> is not the Captain of the ſame Name, who liv'd there two Years ago, and that the Acquaintance of the Military Perſon who inhabited there formerly, may go look for their old Friend, e'en where they can find him.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have ever ſince I ſaw you laſt, been either in Motion, or in Places where Ink is a Liquor more precious than <hi>Tockay.</hi> But tho' I have ever ſince the Beginning of <hi>July,</hi> been in the Country, I have enjoy'd ſmall Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if you except what the ſight of the Country itſelf affords me, which is indeed an Entertainment, of which I can never be weary.</p>
            <p>I never in all my Life time left it without Regret, and always return'd to it with Joy. The Sight of a Mountain is to me more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than that of the moſt pompous Edifice; and Meadows and natural winding Streams, pleaſe me before the moſt beautiful Gardens, and the moſt coſtly Canals: So much does Art appear to me to be ſurpaſs'd by Nature, and the Works of Men by the Works of God. But
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0826500101:45"/>
here I deſire you to believe, that I ſpeak of the Mechanick Works of Men. For as to the Productions of Human Mind, the more Art ſome of them have, as particularly ſome ſorts of Poetry, the more lovely they are, and more eſtimable; becauſe, the more they have in them of true Art, the more they have of Nature; whereas, in the Mechanick Works of Men, the contrary of this is ſeen; for the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate an Art appears in them, the more they recede from plain and ſimple Nature.</p>
            <p>BUT thither to return from whence I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd; as the Sight of the Country has been always more pleaſing to me than that of the Town, ſo, in a late Journey which I took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wild of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> I paſs'd over a Hill which ſhew'd me a more tranſporting Sight than ever the Country had ſhewn me before, either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> The Proſpects, which in <hi>Italy</hi> pleas'd me moſt, were that of the <hi>Valdarno</hi> from the <hi>Apennins,</hi> that of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> from the Mountain of <hi>Viterbo</hi>; of <hi>Rome</hi> at Forty, and of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi> at Fifty Miles diſtance from it, and that of the <hi>Campagne</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Tiuoli</hi> and <hi>Freſcati</hi>; from which two Places, you ſee every Foot of that famous Campaigne, even from the Bottom of <hi>Tiuoli</hi> and <hi>Freſcati,</hi> to the very Foot of the Mountain of <hi>Viterbo</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing to intercept your Sight. But from a Hill which I paſs'd in my late Journey into <hi>Suſſex,</hi> I had a Proſpect more extenſive
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0826500101:46"/>
than any of theſe, and which ſurpaſs'd them at once in Rural Charms, in Pomp and in Magnificence. The Hill which I ſpeak of is call'd <hi>Leith Hill,</hi> and is about five Miles <hi>Southward</hi> from <hi>Darking</hi>; about ſix from <hi>Box-Hill,</hi> and near twelve from <hi>Epſom.</hi> It juts its ſelf out about two Miles beyond that Range of Hills which terminates the <hi>North Downs</hi> to the <hi>South.</hi> When I ſaw from one of thoſe Hills, at about two Miles diſtance, that ſide of <hi>Leith Hill</hi> which faces the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Downs</hi>; it appeared the beautifulleſt Proſpect to me I had ever ſeen. But after we had conquered the Hill it ſelf, I ſaw a Sight that would tranſport a Stoick, a Sight that look'd like Enchantment and Viſion, but Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Beatifick. Beneath us, lay open to our View, all the Wilds of <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and a great Part of that of <hi>Kent,</hi> admirably Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifyed in every Part of them, with Woods, and Fields of Corn, and Paſtures; thoſe Fields of Corn and Paſtures, being every where adorn'd with ſtately Rows of Trees.</p>
            <p>This beautiful Vale, is about thirty Miles in Breadth, and about ſixty in Length, and is terminated to the <hi>South,</hi> by the Majeſtick Range of the <hi>Southern</hi> Hills and the Sea. And 'tis no eaſie matter to decide, whether theſe Hills which appear at thirty, Forty, Fifty, Miles diſtance, with their Tops in the Sky, appear more Awful and Venerable, or the Delicious Vale between you and them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0826500101:47"/>
more inviting. About Noon in a ſerene Day, you may at thirty Miles Diſtance ſee the very Water of the Sea thro' a Chaſm of the Mountains. And that which above all makes it a noble and a wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, is, that at the ſame time that at chirty Miles Diſtance you behold the very Water of the Sea; at the ſame time that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold to the <hi>South</hi> the moſt delicious Rural Proſpect in the World; at that very time, by a little turn of your Head towards the <hi>North,</hi> you look full over <hi>Box Hill,</hi> and ſee the Country beyond it between that and <hi>London</hi>; and over the very Stomacher of it, ſee St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s at five and twenty Miles Diſtance, and <hi>London</hi> beneath it, and <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> and <hi>Hampſtead</hi> beyond it. It may perhaps appear incredible to ſome, that a Place which affords ſo great and ſo ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Proſpect, ſhould have remain'd ſo long in Obſcurity; in ſo great Obſcurity, that 'tis unknown to the very Frequenters of <hi>Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom</hi> and <hi>Box Hill.</hi> But, alas! we live in a Country more fertile of Great Things, than of Men to admire them. Who ever talked of <hi>Cooper</hi>'s <hi>Hill,</hi> till Sir <hi>John Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> made it Illuſtrious? How long did <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> remain in Obſcurity, while twenty pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Authors, little and vile if compared to him, were talk'd of and admir'd? But here in <hi>England</hi> nineteen in twenty like by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Peoples Opinions, and not by their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0826500101:48"/>
own. That Fools by their Approbation ſhould draw in Fools, as Sheep leap after Sheep, is no great matter of Wonder: But that Fools by their Numbers ſhould prove ſo powerful as to influence Men of Senſe, and engage them to approve of what they would otherwiſe utterly have contemned, is what I have often wonder'd at, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could yet account for; but ſuch unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural monſtrous Things as theſe, make the Town more odious and the Country more agreeable.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was always my Opinion, that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a cool and a ſlow Faculty, and no more conſtantly attends a Man in the warmth of Wine and of Converſation, than in the Fury and Rapture of a Poetical Compoſition. If I had in the leaſt doubted of this, what paſt at your Houſe, on the firſt of this Month, would have perfectly convinced me of it; where, for want of Coolneſs to conſider Things, I betray'd my own Cauſe and that of my departed Friend Mr. <hi>Wycherly.</hi> I ſhall ſay but a Word or two of my own, but I deſire to be a little longer about his.</p>
            <p>I then declared it to be my Opinion, that <hi>Free-thinking</hi> would at one time or other
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0826500101:50"/>
endanger our Conſtitution; That it invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates the very Things which are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Security both of Princes and People, and thoſe are the Oaths which the Subjects of <hi>Great Britain</hi> take either as Subjects or Witneſſes. To which a Gentleman in the Company anſwer'd, that the Oaths derived their binding Force from the very Law of Nature, as well as from the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; with which Anſwer, for want of Coolneſs and Time to conſider, I remain'd at that inſtant ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>But as ſoon as I bad Coolneſs and Time to conſider, I found that a double Reply might juſtly be made to that Anſwer of your Friend. For in the firſt Place, the <hi>Free-thinkers</hi> are divided into <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Deiſts.</hi> Now the former of theſe cannot be at all influenced by the Law of Nature. For to them to whom there is no God, there can be no Law of Nature. And as for the latter, tho' <hi>Theiſts</hi> are influenced by the Law of Nature, yet we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Oath which an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> is oblig'd to take as a Subject or a Witneſs, derives its moſt binding Force, and its moſt ſacred Solemnity, from that which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes it from all other Oaths, and that is the laying Hands upon the Bible and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it; which Ceremonies are certainly not deduceable from the Law of Nature, but are wholly derived from that Revelation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0826500101:51"/>
which the <hi>Theiſts</hi> do not believe. <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking</hi> then is the Cauſe, why both <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts</hi> and <hi>Theiſts,</hi> by contemning thoſe Ceremonies, and disbelieving the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from whence they are derived, are come ſlightly to regard the very Oath it ſelf: Yes, <hi>Free-thinking</hi> is the Cauſe that at this time of day we have ſo many brave Knights-Errant of the Poſt, both Spiritual and Secular,</p>
            <q>
               <l>That eat perfidiouſly their Words,</l>
               <l>And ſwear their Ears thro' two-inch Boards;</l>
               <l>Can own the ſame thing and diſown,</l>
               <l>And perjure booty <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi>;</l>
               <l>Can make the Goſpel ſerve their turn,</l>
               <l>And help them out to be forſworn,</l>
               <l>When 'tis laid Hands upon and kiſs'd,</l>
               <l>To be betray'd and ſold like Chriſt.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus have I ſpoke to my own Cauſe in as few Words as I could. I deſire to dwell a little longer upon my late Friend Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi>'s. A Gentleman in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was pleaſed to ſay, that the Comedy of the <hi>Country Wife</hi> had not a juſt Foundation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaid he, it was not practicable for <hi>Horner</hi> to make himſelf paſs for an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch. How! not practicable, when he himſelf was at the bottom of the Deſign, and had taken ſo many Precautions to make
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0826500101:52"/>
it ſucceed? I am ſo far from being of your Friend's Opinion, that I would lay fifty to one, if I were but capable of ſuborning half a dozen Raſcals, who ſhould warmly and induſtriouſly ſpread the Report, that I would make either you or your Friend paſs for <hi>Free-thinkers,</hi> with a conſiderable part of the Town, in ſpight of your utmoſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to undeceive them. How can that be, you'll ſay, when there would be neither Truth nor Probability in ſuch a Report? But have Truth or Probability any thing to do with the Entertainments of publick Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? When my Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſaid,
<q>
                  <l>There's not a Thing on Earth that I can name</l>
                  <l>So Fooliſh and ſo Falſe as Common Fame;</l>
               </q>
did he banter, do you think? or ſpeak it from a thorough Knowledge of the World and of Mankind? There is another of our Poets, who knew Mankind perfectly well, who will tell you the ſame thing in Terms that are ſomething ſtronger.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The World is naturally averſe</l>
               <l>To all the Truth it ſees or hears;</l>
               <l>But ſwallows Nonſenſe and a Lie,</l>
               <l>With Greedineſs and Gluttony.</l>
               <bibl>Butler. Part 3. Cant. 1.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0826500101:53"/>
'Tis true indeed, if the Rabble and Scum of Mankind, of whoſe Voices pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Rumour is compos'd, had but ſo much true Senſe as a ſober Beaſt, why then the Rule that <hi>Horace</hi> has laid down for the Tragick Stage, might do pretty well for the Stage of the World.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Segnius irritant animos demiſſa per aures,</l>
               <l>Quam quae ſint oculis ſubjecta Fidelibus &amp; quae</l>
               <l>Ipſe ſibi tradit Spectator.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But ſince the caſe is far otherwiſe, and ſo many Ideots will believe that they See what they only Hear; (where as no Dog, no Horſe, nay no Aſs is Fool enough to let his external Senſe be impos'd upon by his beaſtly Imagination;) <hi>Butler</hi> has been ſo far from thinking that <hi>Horace</hi>'s Rule for the Tragick Stage is proper for the Stage of the World, that he has laid down for the Latter, one which is the very Reverſe of the other.</p>
            <q>
               <l>For, like the World, Mens Jobber-noles</l>
               <l>Turn round upon their Ears, the Poles;</l>
               <l>And what they're confidently told</l>
               <l>By no Senſe elſe can be controul'd.</l>
            </q>
            <p>What my Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and the Author of <hi>Hudibras</hi> have declar'd in their Verſes,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0826500101:54"/>
our Dramatick Poets have endeavour'd to ſhew upon the Stage, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Eyes of the Rabble of Mankind are downright Cullies to their Ears, and that they eaſily believe that they actually See what they are only impudently Told of: Witneſs what paſſes between <hi>Vindicius</hi> and old <hi>Brutus,</hi> in the <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> of <hi>Lee</hi>; and between <hi>Hamlet</hi> and <hi>Polonius,</hi> in the <hi>Hamlet</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> which ſeems to be the original of the other. And has not <hi>Ben,</hi> Learned <hi>Ben,</hi> who is ſo great a Maſter of his Art, and conſequently of Human life and nature, ſhewn us the very reverſe of this in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe of his admirable Alchimiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> ſhewn us Perſons who what before they had actually ſeen, are made to believe that they only vainly imagin'd, and for no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but becauſe they are impudently told that they only vainly imagin'd it.</p>
            <p>I tell you then again and again, that I would undertake, if I could but be brought to uſe the Means, to make both you and your Friend paſs for Eunuchs, in ſpight of the Teſtimony of Twenty Females, who might cry out in Mrs. <hi>Pinchwife</hi>'s Language, they won't ſee poor Mr. <hi>Horner</hi> abus'd, for to their certain knowledge—For tho' that perhaps might undeceive a few, the general Opinion would ſtill remain. For why may it not be as practicable to geld you and your Friend, as it has been to burſt one of your old
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0826500101:55"/>
Acquaintance, in ſpight not only of Truth, but of all manner of Probability; in ſpight of his own ſolemn Aſſeverations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of the continual vigorous Exerciſes both of Riding and Walking, which he has us'd of late; and laſtly, in ſpight of ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and manual Proof to the contrary given to eminent Chirurgeons and others? when neither Truth, nor reaſonable and ſtrong Preſumption, nor Evidence of Senſe that has been given to ſeveral, have been able to undeceive the many, but the Rupture has ſtill remained in the empty Heads of a thouſand Fools, who have ſtill endeavour'd to propagate the ſenſeleſs Error.</p>
            <q>
               <l>For Fools are ſtubborn in their way,</l>
               <l>As Coins are hardned by th' Allay;</l>
               <l>And Obſtinacy's ne'er ſo ſtiff,</l>
               <l>As when 'tis in a wrong Belief.</l> 
               <bibl>Hudib.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>If any thing that I have ſaid about this laſt Affair may happen to ſurpriſe you, the Surpriſe I ſuppoſe will ſtill be greater, when you are told that the two Apoſtles of this new Doctrine, like thoſe of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> are downright Aſs and Widgeon.</p>
            <p>The groſs of Mankind have infinitely more Propenſity to cenſure than to praiſe. They generally praiſe thro' Intereſt, and they cenſure by Inclination. And yet the Poiſon of falſe Praiſe has more than once
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0826500101:56"/>
grown epidemically contagious, by the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Imbecility of a few, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of a falſe Report. You cannot have forgot what happened to that ugly Beau <hi>Bovey</hi> in the Time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second:</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Bovey</hi>'s a Beauty, if ſome few agree</l>
               <l>To call him ſo; the reſt to that degree</l>
               <l>Affected are, that with their Ears they ſee.</l>
            </q>
            <p>You may remember that ſomething like this has happen'd upon the Repreſentation of ſeveral of our Dramatick Performances, when blundering ſuſtain Tragedies, or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling inſipid Comedies, have, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of a Cabal, and their concerted Applauſes, been cogg'd upon the Town for Maſter-pieces, to the Diſhonour of our Country and Diſgrace of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Poetry. Some Perſons, who have been in theſe Conſpiracies, knew, or ought to have known, better Things. But one unaccountable Effect of Vanity, among many others, is, that ſome Perſons, tho' they do not want Underſtanding, yet, at the Expence of the Reputation of their Common-Senſe, are fond of ſhewing their Power; are fond of ſhewing their Power to Fools, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Reputation of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Senſe with the thinking part of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0826500101:57"/>
How often has ſomething like this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened among our Stateſmen? How often have they topp'd White for Black, and Black for White, upon the thoughtleſs Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? How often have they who Yeſterday were thought Heroes, and Patriots, and Demy-gods, to Day been look'd upon as Villains, and Thieves, and Robbers; and they who Yeſterday were held Villains and Traitors, have to Day been regarded as Heroes, and Saints, and Patriots? Have not our Politicians more than once turn'd the Rehearſal out of Ridicule, by turning the whole State topſy turvy in a Morning, only by the Artillery of falſe Reports, without ſo much as ſtriking a real Blow? and by that means proving to all the World, that one might take Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> for a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician; that Mr. <hi>Bays</hi>'s Politicks were good and ſound, and that his <hi>quondum</hi> Grace of <hi>Bucks</hi> was out, when he pretended to make a Jeſt of them.</p>
            <p>But in ſhort, and Raillery apart, the Prevalency of falſe Reports, concerted by five or ſix dark Sophiſters, has more than once made ſome of the beſt and greateſt Men in the Kingdom, who but juſt before were approv'd, applauded, admir'd and cheriſh'd by all the Lovers of their Country, become all at once the very Hatred and Scorn of the Rabble, which I believe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever did, or could have happen'd any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0826500101:58"/>
where but in <hi>England</hi>; either as to the Exceſs of Malice in the Inventors, or the Exceſs of Credulity in the Believers and Propagators of thoſe falſe Reports. For that which makes <hi>England</hi> the moſt ſplene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Country in the Univerſe, makes it the chief and reſidentiary Seat of Slander. For there never was a very ſplenetick Man, unleſs he was a Man of an extraordinary Underſtanding, but he was at the ſame time a Slanderer. And the ſame virulent Humour, that cauſes ſo many noble <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> to hang, and poiſon, and drown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, cauſes them likewiſe to do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to murder the Reputation of their Neighbours; and the ſame Humour that in ſome degree caus'd the Invention of the Slander at firſt, cauſes likewiſe the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it, and the Credulity of its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Judge then, if in ſuch a Country as this, even an improbable falſe Report be not a juſt Foundation for a Comedy. But the Report of <hi>Horner</hi>'s Impotency, ſince he himſelf invented it, and prepared the Way for it, is ſo highly probable, that a Man muſt be very Hypercritical, who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, cenſures my late moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Friend. I have a great deal more to ſay upon this Subject, but I want Time at preſent.</p>

            <p>YOURS of the 22d of the laſt Month came to my Hands in due time. I had ſooner returned you Thanks for the favour of it, and had ſooner congratulated you upon the return of your Health, upon which ſo many Healths depend, and which under God has been ſo often the cauſe of the Recovery of mine; if I had not been engag'd in an Important Buſineſs which took up all my Hours. I likewiſe return you my hearty thanks for ſetting the Affair between me and my Brother-in-Law in a true light, tho' I perceive by what you write that there are Perſons who continue to believe him. But I would fain ask thoſe Perſons what Motive they have to reſtrain them from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unjuſt or a baſe thing, which I have not in a much greater Degree. They will
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0826500101:60"/>
ſay, perhaps, that they have got a great deal more Money than I have. But, Sir, is not their getting a great deal a ſign of their great Love for it? And if I have all my life time had but a little, do they believe it has proceeded from my Incapacity of getting it, or from my Contempt of it? And which is moſt like to ſecure any one from doing Injuſtice; the Love of Money, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it? Have their Purſes been more conſtantly open to the Occaſions of their Friends and Acquaintance? Have they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd more magnanimous Thoughts, and more exalted above Selfiſhneſs? Have they more Underſtanding to diſcern their true Intereſt, and to know that no Man can live happily without living reputably? Have they had a more liberal Education, or a more generous Converſation? I was till five and forty plung'd in the Converſation of the great World, and was every Day in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Gentlemen, who are univerſally known to be Men of no ordinary Merit, who wanted no Diſcernment to know me, and who have ſeveral of them given publick proofs of their Eſteem for me. Now if I miſtake not, before the Age of forty five the Manners of Men are unalterably form'd. For theſe laſt fifteen Years I have retir'd from the World, and confin'd my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to three or four of my old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance who are publickly known to be Men
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0826500101:61"/>
of Men of Honour and Underſtanding. Can any reaſonable Man then believe, that I, who while I was converſant in the World kept my Reputation clear, ſhould retire to be a Villain in Solitude? If I refus'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a Demand which my Brother-in-Law pretended he had upon me, 'tis becauſe he had no title to any thing from me but his want of it. If he had ask'd me to give him the Money which he ſaid I ow'd him, I had certainly given it him. But I could not think without Indignation, that an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wretch, to whom I had endeavour'd at the expence of my Time and Intereſt to do the moſt Important Services, ſhould pretend to extort it from me by Inſults and Brutality. What thoſe Services are, I ſhall let you know in my next; but I am weary at preſent, and ſo without doubt are you.</p>

            <head>TO Mr. * * *</head>
            <head type="sub">In which are ſome Paſſages of the LIFE of Mr. JOHN CROWN, Author of Sir <hi>Courtly Nice.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall now, in compliance with the repeated Requeſts you have made to me, ſay ſomething concerning the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of Mr. JOHN CROWN, and the moſt remarkable Paſſages of his Life. Mr. CROWN was bred under his Father, an Independant Miniſter, in that part of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern America,</hi> which is called <hi>Nova Scotia.</hi> But the Vivacity of his Genius made him ſoon grow impatient of that ſullen and gloomy Education, and ſoon oblig'd him to get looſe from it, and ſeek his Fortune in <hi>England.</hi> But it was his Fate, at his firſt Arrival here, to happen on an Employment more formal, if poſſible, than his <hi>American</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0826500101:63"/>
Education. His Neceſſity, upon his firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival here, oblig'd him to become a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Uſher to an old Independant Lady. But he ſoon grew as weary of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Office, as he had been before of the Diſcipline of <hi>Nova Scotia.</hi> One would think that theſe were but indifferent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives to the commencing polite Author. But neither theſe nor his Poverty, which was great, could oppreſs his aſpiring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, aſpiring to Reputation and Diſtinction, rather than to Fortune and Power. His Writings ſoon made him known to the Court and Town: Yet it was neither to the Favour of the Court, nor of <hi>Wilmot</hi> Lord <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> one of the ſhining Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, that he was indebted for the Nomination which the King made of him for the writing the Mask of <hi>Calypſo,</hi> but to the Malice of that noble Lord, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by that Preference to mortify Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> Upon the breaking out of the two Parties, after the Diſcovery of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot, the Favour that he was in at Court, the Gayety of his Youth, and his being unacquainted with true political Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, engaged him to embrace the Party of the Tories. About that time he writ <hi>The City Politicks,</hi> on purpoſe to Satyrize and expoſe the Whigs; a Comedy ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that it deſerv'd to be writ in a much better Cauſe: But after he had writ
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0826500101:64"/>
it, he met with very great Difficulties in the getting it acted. <hi>Bennet</hi> Lord <hi>Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who was then Lord Chamberlain of the King's Houſhold, and who had ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſpous'd the Whigs, who were at that time powerful in Parliament, in order to ſupport himſelf againſt the Favour and Power of the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Danby,</hi> who was his declared Enemy, us'd all his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſuppreſs it. One while it was prohibited on the account of its being Dangerous, another while it was laid aſide on the pretence of its being Flat and Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid; till Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> at laſt was forc'd to have Recourſe to the King himſelf, and to engage him to give his abſolute Command to the Lord Chamberlain for the acting of it; which Command the King was pleas'd to give in his own Perſon. For that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch lov'd a Comedy above all Things, (excepting one Thing) and had no mean Opinion of Mr. <hi>Crown</hi>'s Qualifications to ſucceed in it. While he was thus in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the King and the Court, I have more than once heard him ſay, that tho' he had a ſincere Affection for the King, he had yet a mortal Averſion to the Court. The Promiſe of a Sum of Money made him ſometimes appear there to ſolicit the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: But as ſoon as he had got it, he vaniſh'd, and continued a long time ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from it, of which, he told me, the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0826500101:65"/>
Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> took once Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to complain to the King; whoſe way of anſwering that Complaint, puts me in mind of a Paſſage in <hi>Boileau</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moignon.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Hier de vous on parla chez le Roy,</l>
               <l>Et d' attentat Horrible on traita la Satire,</l>
               <l>Et le Roy que dit il. Le Roy ſe prit a rire.</l>
            </q>
            <p>It was at the very latter End of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Reign, that Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> being tyr'd with the Fatigue of Writing, and ſhock'd by the Uncertainty of Theatrical Succeſs, and deſirous to ſhelter himſelf from the Reſentments of thoſe numerous Enemies which he had made by his <hi>City Politicks,</hi> made his Application immediately to the King himſelf; and deſir'd his Majeſty to eſtabliſh him in ſome Office, that might be a Security to him for Life. The King had the Goodneſs to aſſure him, he ſhould have an Office, but added that he would firſt ſee another Comedy. Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to excuſe himſelf, by telling the King, that he plotted ſlowly and awkwardly; the King replyed, that he would help him to a Plot, and ſo put into his Hands the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Comedy called <hi>Non pued Eſſer.</hi> Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> was oblig'd immediately to go to work upon it; but, after he had writ three Acts of it, found to his Surpriſe, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0826500101:66"/>
Play had ſome time before been tranſlated, and acted, and damn'd, under the Title of <hi>Tarugo</hi>'s <hi>Wiles, or the Coffee-houſe.</hi> Yet, ſupported by the King's Command, he went boldly on and finiſh'd it; and here ſee the Influence of a Royal Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Crown,</hi> who had once before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd the Commonwealth of Learning with a very agreeable Comedy in his <hi>City Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> yet in Sir <hi>Courtly Nice</hi> went far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, and infinitely ſurpaſſed himſelf. For tho' there is ſomething in the part of <hi>Crack</hi> which borders upon Farce, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor alone muſt anſwer for that. For Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> could not omit the Part of <hi>Crack,</hi> that is of <hi>Tarugo,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Farce depending upon it, without a downright Affront to the King, who had given him that Play for his Ground-work. But all that is of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Growth in Sir <hi>Courtly Nice</hi> is admirable; for tho' we find in it neither the fine Deſigning of <hi>Ben. Johnſon</hi>; nor the general and maſculine Satyr of <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly</hi>; nor that Grace, that Delicacy, nor that Courtly Air which make the Charms of <hi>Etherege</hi>; yet is the Dialogue ſo lively and ſo ſpirited, and ſo attractively diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and adapted to the ſeveral Characters; four of thoſe Characters are ſo entirely new, yet ſo general and ſo important, are drawn ſo truly and ſo graphically, and oppos'd to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0826500101:67"/>
each other, <hi>Surly</hi> to Sir <hi>Courtly</hi> and <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> to <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> with ſuch a ſtrong and entire Oppoſition; thoſe Extremes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, the one of which is the Grievance, and the other the Plague of Society and Converſation; exceſſive Ceremony on one ſide, and on the other ſide Rudeneſs and Brutality, are ſo finely expos'd in <hi>Surly</hi> and Sir <hi>Courtly</hi>; and thoſe Diviſions and Animoſities in the two great Parties of <hi>England,</hi> which have ſo long diſturb'd the publick Quiet, and undermined the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Intereſt, are ſo happily repreſented and ridicul'd in <hi>Teſtimony</hi> and <hi>Hothead,</hi> that tho' I have more than twenty times read over this charming Comedy, yet I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways read it, not only with Delight but Rapture. And 'tis my Opinion, that the greateſt Comick Poet that ever liv'd in any Age, might have been proud to have been the Author of it.</p>
            <p>The Play was now juſt ready to appear to the World; and as every one that had ſeen it rehears'd was highly pleas'd with it; every one who had heard of it was big with the Expectation of it; and Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> was delighted with the flattering Hope of being made happy for the reſt of his Life, by the Performance of the King's Promiſe; when, upon the very laſt Day of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal, he met <hi>Cave Underhill</hi> coming from the Play-Houſe as he himſelf was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0826500101:68"/>
towards it: Upon which the Poet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primanding the Player for neglecting ſo conſiderable a Part as he had in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and neglecting it on a Day of ſo much Conſequence, as the very laſt Day of Rehearſal: Oh Lord, Sir, ſays <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> we are all undone. Wherefore, ſays Mr. <hi>Crown,</hi> is the Play-Houſe on Fire? The whole Nation, replys the Player, will quickly be ſo, for the King is dead. At the hearing which diſmal Words, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was little better; for he who but the Moment before was raviſh'd with the Thought of the Pleaſure, which he was about to give to his King, and of the Favours which he was afterwards to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him, this Moment found, to his unſpeakable Sorrow, that his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Patron was gone for ever, and with him all his Hopes. The King indeed reviv'd from his Apoplectick Fit, but three Days after dyed, and Mr. <hi>Crown</hi> by his Death was replung'd in the deepeſt Melancholy.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, have I given you a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Education of Mr. <hi>John Crown,</hi> and of the moſt remarkable Circumſtances of his Life, to the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. I ſhall, as ſoon as I have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, continue this Relation from the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> to the Death of Mr. <hi>Crown.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have been about to write to you every Poſt for theſe ten Days, but one Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or other has ſtill diverted me; but I ſhall now make more than amends, for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentem tibi Epiſtolam Impingam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I had had the greateſt Inclination imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to accept of the Invitation which you ſent me by your Familiar; yet ſomething has happen'd which would have been a Juſt, tho' a Ridiculous Impediment. For I had given my word to go another way, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to pull a certain Beaſt out of a Ditch, who had fal'n into it, thro' a more than Beſtial Stupidity, which engag'd him to look upon things above him, inſtead of grazing and following the Inſtinct of Nature. But
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0826500101:76"/>
to ſpeak plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and return to your Invitation; who could have expected any ſuch thing, from one who had ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly abandon'd his old Acquaintance, who had never ſo much as once in Twenty Years miſs'd an opportunity of ſerving him, and abandon'd him contrary both to Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Politicks. For a Man who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts his Friend in an Affair in which 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that he ſhould eſpouſe him, does two Things at once to his own Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For firſt, he ſhews the World that he has no Body's Intereſt at heart but his own, which Indifference the World, as ſoon as it perceives it, will be ſure to return in Kind: Secondly, he gives a pretty convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Proof, that he has not Capacity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to underſtand his own Intereſt; for he who in any Point that is reaſonable is deaf to his Friend's Intereſt, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly blind to his own. Now what Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance can I have on a Perſon who makes it evident to me, that he neither cares for my Intereſt, nor underſtands his own? If you had laid aſide the Alteration of <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olanus</hi> for better Plays, there had been a plauſible Apology for your Breach of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But to ſacrifice me to Fools, was Impudent as 'twas Barbarous. I have read the noble Stuff which you have acted this Winter, all but <hi>Buſiris,</hi> which was not publiſh'd when I left the Town. But ſome
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0826500101:77"/>
Perſons, whom I have ſeen in this place, tell me there is a Rape in it. If that is true, it has a Fault in it for which nothing can make Atonement. A Rape is the peculiar Barbarity of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage. Neither <hi>Greecians</hi> nor <hi>Romans</hi> would ſuffer it, nor can the <hi>French</hi> at preſent bear it. The very Apprehenſion of a Rape, tho' the thing did not follow it, damn'd the <hi>Theodore</hi> of <hi>Corneille</hi>; which, if you will believe Monſieur <hi>Hedelin,</hi> is one of his beſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies. I would fain know from you, who have had a twenty Years Experience of the Stage, for what Reaſon the Women, who will ſit as quietly and paſſively at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Rape in a Tragedy, as if they thought that Raviſhing gave them a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for which they have a juſt Apology, will ſtart and flinch like unback'd Fillies, at the leaſt Approach of <hi>Rem</hi> to <hi>Re</hi> in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, unleſs that Approach happens to be made in the Houſe of Bondage. I have been ſometimes apt to entertain a Suſpicion, that 'tis not the luſcious Matter which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs them in Comedy, but the ſecret im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Satire upon the Sex. For a Woman in Comedy never grants the laſt Favour to one to whom ſhe is not marry'd, but it proclains the Man's Triumph and her Shame. It always ſhews her Weakneſs and often her Inconſtancy, and ſometimes her Fraud and Perfidiouſneſs. But a Rape in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0826500101:78"/>
Tragedy is a Panegyrick upon the Sex: For there the Woman has all the Advantage of the Man. For ſhe is ſuppos'd to remain innocent, and to be pleas'd without her Conſent; while the Man, who is accounted a damn'd Villain, proclaims the Power of Female Charms, which have the Force to drive him to ſo horrid a Violence. But to return to the other Plays, which you acted this laſt Winter. I have read two Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without one Jeſt in them. But you will ſay, perhaps, that the Play-Houſe was throng'd for eight or ten Days together at the Repreſentation of theſe Comedies; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſo. But then, if it was ſo throng'd at the Repreſentation of damn'd Plays, I hope my Ears will no more be ſtunn'd with the Noiſe of the Improvement of a general Taſte, and that for the future no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will be drawn from the Numbers of an Audience to their Capacity. For the very ſame Reaſon that the Builder's Trade, the Carpenters and the Joyners are ſo very much improv'd; for the very ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſo many fine Houſes, ſo many beautiful Streets, ſo many ſtately Squares, and, as it were, whole Towns are building in your North-Weſt Suburbs; for that very ſame Reaſon is your Theatre crowded. A Penetration that comes far ſhort of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, may ſuffice to ſhew, that the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Nobility and Gentry of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0826500101:79"/>
Town, and conſequently of their Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, are exceedingly augmented by ſome great Events which have happen'd of late Years, <hi>viz.</hi> the Revolution, the Union with <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Return of our Armies from the Continent, and the King's Acceſſion to the Crown. But as for the Improvement of a general Taſte, 'tis ſo great a Blunder, that it could never be thought of among conſiderate People. 'Tis improv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with a vengeance, 'tis refin'd in a glorious manner! improv'd as the Taſte of a Green-ſickneſs Girl, who leaves pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable Meat for Charcoal; refin'd as the Taſte of an Hyſterick Woman, who is cheriſh'd by a Stink, and ſickens at a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume; or as the Taſte of a modern Letcher, who, like a Swine, prefers a Sirreverence to the fineſt thing in the World. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Diverſions, which they follow'd this Winter, their Maſquerades, their <hi>Italian</hi> Farces, and their <hi>French</hi> Tumblings, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but ſhew the great Refinement of their Taſte. If the general Taſte were improv'd, two things would certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, good Plays would be writ, and damn'd ones would not be endured. But <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Plays you will ſay were crowded, and <hi>Tom. D'Urfey</hi>'s neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Winter. Be it ſo. I ſhall ſhew you in my next, that the Generality of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0826500101:80"/>
an Audience, in ſpight of their Practice, have it both in their Heads and their Hearts, to value <hi>Tom. D'Urfey,</hi> and to deſpiſe <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS is the third Letter which I have writ to you, without the Satisfaction of receiving an Anſwer, which has been a great Acceſſion to the Calamity which I labour'd under before; and I have felt the Frowns of Fortune the more ſeverely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been attended with yours. 'Tis hard, that it ſhou'd be in her Power to alienate not only our Poſſeſſions, but even the Hearts and Souls of our deareſt and moſt valued Friends. As we learn from her hourly Inconſtancy, that there is no Man ſecure from her Power, methinks it ſhould be the common Intereſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to alleviate her Strokes by uſing their Fellow-Creatures gently, while they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Diſgrace; eſpecially ſince long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has taught us, that ſhe is often the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0826500101:82"/>
moſt barbarous to thoſe who deſerve her Cruelty the leaſt; ſo that her Perſecution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part directly contrary to Reaſon, ſhould leaſt of all be abetted by reaſonable Men like you. My Intentions have been very good, tho' the Event has not been anſwerable to them; and methinks when we paſs a Judgment upon our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, not by their Intentions, but by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, we paſs a ſevere Law againſt our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe our Intentions are in our Power, but Events are not; and no Man can foreſee the future. My very Enemies muſt confeſs, that my Calamity has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from any Extravagance of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or a luxurious Life, but only from the too eager Deſire of Getting; which, if it be a Fault, who at preſent is guiltleſs? Sure no Man ever was juſtly blam'd for catching a Diſtemper, whoſe Infection was epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. And yet that very eager Deſire of Getting has not proceeded from any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Avarice, but only from my Exceſs of Love to your Daughter, and an earneſt Zeal to ſecure her Happineſs before I ſhould be prevented by Sickneſs or Death, or that uſual Change which attends on Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Affairs. So that my Eagerneſs to make your Daughter happy, has been the very thing that has made her miſerable by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under her Father's Diſpleaſure one for whom ſhe believes it her Duty to be concern'd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0826500101:83"/>
So that what ſhe ſuffers by your Diſpleaſure cauſes it to be more grievous to me, and makes me more paſſionately and impatiently deſire that you would be reconcil'd to me. My Fault has been my Error and not my Crime, and I have Youth, and Health, and Vigour of Mind enough to retrieve my Fortune. And when I have retriev'd her, I have Reaſon to believe, that ſhe will then be conſtant to me, becauſe I have ſeen and experienc'd the only Error which could have oblig'd her to leave me; and therefore as ſoon as I am re-eſtabliſh'd, I ſhall be more happy becauſe more ſecure than if I had never falln. In the mean while, Sir, to give you a convincing Proof, that I prefer your Daughter's Happineſs to my own, I am willing to do any thing to ſecure her a Competency while my own Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is doubtful. I am willing to put it as much out of my Power, as it is contrary to my Inclinations, to touch the other two thouſand Pounds.</p>

            <p>ABout the middle of the laſt Month I ſent you a long Letter, in which I endeavour'd to ſhew the Extravagance of that Opinion, that there is at this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us an Improvement of the general Taſte, with relation to Poetry and the <hi>Belles Lettres.</hi> And I promis'd in my next to ſhew the Error or the Falacy of thoſe, who pretend to maintain that Opinion from the crowded Audiences at the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Plays, and the thin ones at thoſe which were writ by Mr. <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0826500101:85"/>
Vogue and by Faſhion, as a late noble Poet has told us.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Their private Wiſh obey the publick Voice,</l>
               <l>'Twixt Good and Bad Whimſey decides, not Choice;</l>

               <l>They know what they would have, not what they like.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I promis'd to ſhew, that the one of theſe Authors has been eſteem'd, and the other contemn'd by Men of Senſe ſo long, that the Approbation of the one, and the Contempt of the other, is come at laſt to make an Impreſſion on the Rabble; when I mention that Word, I do not mean ſuch a Rabble as you have ſometimes on the Stage at <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> or at <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> but ſuch a Rabble as is but too often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in your Pit and Side-Boxes.</p>
            <p>A very great Part of thoſe who pretend to be in Love with <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> if he were now living, and his moſt celebrated Plays were to be acted <hi>De novo,</hi> without a Cabal, without Character or Prepoſſeſſion, wou'd Hiſs and Damn the very Things of which they are now the faſhionable Admirers, which ſeems plain to me from this very Reaſon, becauſe the modern Plays which they moſt approve of, are the very Reverſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0826500101:86"/>
of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s, with reſpect either to his Excellencies or his Faults.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> is very juſtly celebrated for the Truth and Juſtneſs of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, for the Beauty of his Sentiments, for the Simplicity and Dignity of his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and for his moving the Paſſions pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully by the meer force of Nature. But the preſent Spectators of Tragedies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of thoſe moſt, in which the Paſſions are mov'd leaſt. They will endure no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Tragedy, in whoſe principal Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter Love is not the predominant Quality. Now Love predominating in the principal Character, too often falſifies and confounds thoſe Characters, and by Conſequence but too often deſtroys the Beauty of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, becauſe no Sentiment can be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, which is improper in him who ſpeaks it. Beſides, there are not three of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Tragedies, which have any thing like thoſe Sentiments which abound in <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi>; Sentiments, which, at the ſame time that they ſhew Sagacity and Penetration, are eaſie, juſt, and natural.</p>
            <p>The modern Readers and Spectators of Tragedies will endure no Tragedy which has the Simplicity and <hi>naiveté</hi> of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi>'s Dialogue; a Simplicity, wherever the occaſion requires it, attended with Force, and Dignity, and Pomp, and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Inſtead of that noble and natural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0826500101:87"/>
they are for a flatulant Style, in which the Poet puts the Change upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſpeaks almoſt always himſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making his Characters ſpeak.</p>
            <p>But as the Readers and Spectators of Modern Tragedies approve of thoſe moſt, which are the very reverſe of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s with reſpect to his Beauties and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſo they declare very loudly againſt his Faults. The Faults of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> which are rather thoſe of the Age in which he liv'd, are his perpetual Rambles, and his apparent Duplicity in ſome of his Plays, or Triplicity of Action, and the frequent breaking the Continuity of the Scenes. The preſent Spectators declare againſt this, in appearance, but at the ſame time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this Multiplicity of Action in ſome Modern Plays, concealed by a Jumble and a Confuſion which is incomprehenſible and altogether unintelligible. Another of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi>'s Faults is the Length of Time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the carrying on his Dramatick Action. The preſent Spectators are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſhock'd at this in a modern Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but at the ſame time approve of thoſe in which the Unity of Time is preſerved by offending all Common Senſe.</p>
            <p>If a Modern Poet in one of his Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould ſhew any Thing like <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Rambles, ſhould introduce a Tragedy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage, which ſhould begin in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0826500101:88"/>
and end in <hi>Aſia,</hi> like the Moor of <hi>Venice,</hi> that Play would be exploded and damn'd with very great Damnation. But the Modern Spectators of Tragedies great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem and are fond of thoſe, in which the Unity of Place is preſerv'd, ſometimes by whimſical comick Abſurdities, and ſometimes by dreadful and prodigious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies.</p>
            <p>From all this I conclude, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Spectators of modern Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies, having the greateſt Eſteem for thoſe, which have leaſt of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and declaring loudly againſt his Faults, would damn <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> if living.</p>
            <p>Nor can I believe that ſeveral who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be paſſionate Admirers of <hi>Milton,</hi> would treat him if living in any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Becauſe they are ſo fond of nothing as of that ſoft and effeminate Rhyme, which makes the very Reverſe of the Harmony, and of the manly, and powerful, and noble Enthuſiaſm of <hi>Milton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe the Generality of Poets and Wits his Contemporaries did not eſteem him, tho' they were by no means inferior in Underſtanding to his pretended living Admirers. <hi>Willmot</hi> Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as mention'd him, in his Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Tenth Satyr of the firſt Book of <hi>Horace.</hi> When he came to imitate that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0826500101:89"/>
Paſſage, <hi>Forte epos Acer, ut nemo Varius du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Milton</hi> he names <hi>Waller.</hi> And when that noble Peer was ſome Years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erwards ask'd by Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> ſince Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> for which of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Poets he had moſt Eſteem, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd without the leaſt Heſitation, for <hi>Boileau</hi> among the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Cowley</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets. Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> in his firſt Book of Criticiſm treated the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe Loſt</hi> with Contempt, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Readers of Poetry, for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years after it was publiſhed, knew no more of that exalted Poem, than if it had been writ in <hi>Arabick:</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in his Preface before <hi>the State of Innocence,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been the firſt, thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men excepted whoſe Verſes are before <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Poem, who diſcover'd in ſo publick a Manner an extraordinary Opinion of <hi>Milton</hi>'s extraordinary Merit. And yet Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> at that time knew not half the Extent of his Excellence, as more than twenty Years afterwards he confeſs'd to me, and as is pretty plain from his writing <hi>the State of Innocence.</hi> For Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> in that Poem, which is founded on the <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> falls ſo infinitely ſhort of thoſe wonderful Qualities, by which <hi>Milton</hi> has diſtinguiſh'd that noble Poem from all other Poems, that one of theſe two Things muſt be granted; either that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> knew
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0826500101:90"/>
not the Extent of <hi>Milton</hi>'s great Qualities, or that he deſign'd to be a Foil to him. But they who knew Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> know very well, that he was not of a Temper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be a Foil to any one.</p>
            <p>I hope I have ſaid enough to convince you that the Approbations and Cenſures of the Generality of an Audience are deriv'd from Sentiments which are not their own, and which are the Effects of Authority, and not of Reaſon. When Men who are, and are eſteem'd, Perſons of more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Judgment, have declar'd themſelves from time to time, during a Century, or half a Century, concerning Poems Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick or others, thoſe Declarations are the Cauſe, that other Perſons at length, being guided by the Light which is held out to them, fondly imagine that it was kindled by that Particle of Heav'nly Fire which they fancy to be within them. But the numerous and violent Cabals, which are form'd to ſupport or decry Dramatick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, may ſerve inſtead of a thouſand Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to convince the moſt obſtinate, that there is no ſuch thing as a general Taſte among us. It being abſolutely impoſſible that great Numbers of Perſons of a fine Diſcernment and a true Taſte ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to extol a Blockhead at the Expence of a noble Art, at the Expence of their own Reputation and the Reputation of their

            <p>I Here ſend you by the Bearer, ſeveral Pieces in Verſe and Proſe, writ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by me, and lately printed in two Volumes; but I ſend them not without a double Deſign on you.

Secondly, I deſire that you will give me leave to ſay ſomething concerning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Pieces contain'd in theſe two Volumes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd more particularly concerning the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which oblig'd me to write the chief of them at the firſt, and to publiſh them lately together; which I ſhall do with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0826500101:96"/>
to one who has done ſo much Good in the ſame Cauſe in which moſt of them were writ.</p>
            <p>Several of the Pieces in Verſe and Proſe, and three of the Plays, were writ in the Cauſe of Liberty. The narrative Poems of greater Length were all of them written upon Great and Publick Occaſions, and were deſign'd as ſo many Panegyricks upon thoſe Illuſtrious Perſons whoſeGreat and Heroick Actions had made them Benefactors to <hi>Great Britain</hi> and Liberty.</p>
            <p>It has always been my Opinion, that a free Nation can never be too zealous in maintaining their Liberties, becauſe we have been taught by too many fatal Events, that they have at laſt been often loſt by the Security and Corruptions of thoſe who had for ſeveral Centuries enjoy'd them. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and the ancient and modern <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> But whenever the Liberties of a great Nation are in manifeſt Danger, there all the ſeveral Members of it, who are not abjectly baſe, will uſe their utmoſt Efforts in defending them. The Liberties of <hi>Great Britain</hi> have in our own Memory been in ſo much Danger, that they have been twice in thirty Years retrieved from immediate Ruin, firſt by the Revolution, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Acceſſion of King <hi>George</hi> to the Imperial Crown of this Iſland, but even
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0826500101:97"/>
now they by no Means appear to me to be entirely ſecur'd.</p>
            <p>Since the Revolution, things appear to have been ſtrangely reverſt in <hi>Great Britain</hi> with regard to Liberty. In four or five Reigns immediately preceding the Arrival of King <hi>William</hi> of Immortal Memory, the Court was for Arbitrary Power, and the People appear'd ſtrenuous for Liberty. But ſince that time, the Court has for the moſt part contended for Liberty, and the People, I mean too great a Part of them, have declar'd for Slavery. Now, if ever we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> only Motive of writing the chief of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>had of the Danger, which the Liberties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> my Country were in, and conſequently
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0826500101:98"/>
the Liberties of the Chriſtian World, of which ours are the ſtrongeſt Bulwark. I wrote them not then as one who eſpous'd a Party, but as a Lover of my Country, and one zealous to promote the Happineſs of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> I have been ſo far from having any ambitious Aims or any ſordid Views of Intereſt, that I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſee ſeveral of the publick Rewards engroſs'd by ſome who are luke-warm, and by others who are <hi>Jacobites</hi> in Whig Cloathing, while I have remain'd very poor in a very advanc'd Age. But one Thing indeed I have ſometimes been apt to think exceeding hard, and that is, that theſe lukewarm Perſons, and theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> in Whig Cloathing, ſhould be ſuffer'd to make uſe of the Power which they have acquir'd by their Falſhood, to the utter Ruin of one who has behav'd himſelf all along with the utmoſt Sincerity in the nobleſt Cauſe of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, have I laid before you the Motive which engag'd me to write the greater part of the Pieces which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the two Volumes. I ſhall now ſhew you, how the ſame Motive oblig'd me to uſe my Endeavours to preſerve them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they ſhould appear worthy of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to publiſh them in the two fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mention'd Volumes. It was in <hi>October</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0826500101:99"/>
1716, that I deſir'd a Bookſeller to collect them for me. I thought that after ſo much Time had paſs'd ſince the writing them, I ſhould be capable of forming as true a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my ſelf of them, as any other Perſon whatſoever, who has no better Judgment in Poetical Matters than I have, or that the Precept of <hi>Horace, nonum prematur in annum,</hi> muſt be falſe and vain.</p>
            <p>Upon a very ſlow and deliberate Peruſal of them, I could not but conclude, that with all their Faults they were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depriv'd of that noble Fire, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can make them pleaſing; nor of that Juſtneſs and Solidity which alone can make them laſting. I believ'd that if they were publiſh'd together, they might be able one Day to do ſome Good to the publick, and no Diſcredit to me.</p>
            <p>And I was the more encourag'd to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on this Publication, becauſe, Sir, you may be pleas'd to remember, that they had been favourably receiv'd by the moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Perſons of both Parties for their Judgment in Poetry, and their Knowledge of the <hi>Belles Lettres,</hi> by the late Earls of <hi>Godolphin</hi> and <hi>Halifax,</hi> Mr. <hi>Maynwaring</hi> and others among the Whigs, and by the preſent Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and my Lord <hi>Lanſdown</hi> among the Tories. And if any Temptation could make me vain, it would
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0826500101:100"/>
be the favourable Opinions of the laſt two Noble Perſons, becauſe as their Judgments in matters of Poetry are unqueſtion'd, they can never be ſuppos'd to be partial to one, who has all his Life-time appear'd very zealous in contrary Principles to thoſe of a Party, which they by ſome have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to favour. My Lord <hi>Lanſdown,</hi> by making me a Preſent ſo noble, as never has been made by a Subject to any Author now living, ſufficiently declar'd that what I had writ had not been altogether diſpleaſing to him. And 'tis to the warm Approbation which the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> gave to the Poem on the Battel of <hi>Blenheim,</hi> that I owe the Honour of being firſt known to the late illuſtrious Earl of <hi>Godolphin,</hi> whoſe good and great Qualities, and the Benefits which <hi>Great Britain</hi> receiv'd from his good and his wiſe Adminiſtration, make me proud to own for the firſt and greateſt of my Benefactors.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I found Encouragement to preſerve theſe Pieces, and eſpecially the Poems writ in the Cauſe of Liberty. But I was convinc'd at the ſame time, that the only way to preſerve them would be to publiſh them together. They were in a great many different Hands, and ſome of them in the Hands of ſuch who were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies to the Cauſe in which they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0826500101:101"/>
were written. Some of them had been very incorrectly printed. The very Subject which ought to recommend them to all <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> as well as the Harmony with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rhyme in ſeveral of the Poems, made ſome of them for the preſent leſs pleaſing to above half the Readers of Poetry. Some of them that had once appear'd with Applauſe ſeem'd to have been forgot. For all things of late Days have been manag'd by Cabal and Party; and there ſeems to have been a Conſpiracy in the Commonwealth of Learning, among Fools of all Sorts, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt Folly at the Expence of Common-ſenſe, and make Stupidity triumph over Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the very Dominions of Wit, which has been one of the Cauſes why Things are reduced to that deplorable State upon our <hi>Britiſh Parnaſſus. Apollo</hi> and the Muſes ſeem to have abandon'd it; diſdaining that their Divinities ſhould honour a Place with their Songs, where Fools and Pedants, Buffoons, Eunuchs and Tumblers have ſo often met with Applauſe.</p>
            <p>Who could have thought, if he had been told twenty Years ago, that he ſhould out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live Tragedy and Comedy, that he had been promis'd a Life of not quite twenty Years? Yet 'tis very plain that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe had extended no further: ſuch is the Power of Cabal and Party.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0826500101:102"/>
I have all along had a great Averſion to the making a Party, or the entring into a Cabal, and have ſometimes look'd upon it with Horrour and ſometimes with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Who that has Common-ſenſe can forbear laughing, when he ſees a Parcel of Fellows, who call themſelves Wits, ſit in Combination round a Coffee Table, as Sharpers do round a Hazard Table, to trick honeſt Gentlemen into an Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Works, and bubble them of their Underſtandings?</p>
            <p>And yet I have all along known, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the greater Poetry can grow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately popular without a Cabal or Party. I have a long time been convinced, that the more ſublimely any thing is writ in Poetry, and the nearer it comes to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the longer it will be before it grows popular, without ſuch a Cabal; becauſe the more ſublimely it is writ, and the nearer it comes to Perfection, the more it is rais'd above the Apprehenſions of the Vulgar. And yet notwithſtanding this Knowledge, I have all along reſolv'd to have no Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or to owe it to my Writings.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, you ſee the Reaſons, why the Writings that make up theſe two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, or at leaſt the greater Part of them, had been in danger of being loſt, if I had not taken Pains during my Life-time to correct and publiſh them together. There
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0826500101:103"/>
is one more Reaſon remaining, and that is, the Malice of thoſe People whom the World calls Poets, whoſe Hatred I have been proud to incur, by ſpeaking bold and neceſſary Truths in the behalf of a noble Art, which they have miſerably abus'd by their vile Poems, and their more vile Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms. And yet 'tis from theſe People that the fooliſh Readers of Poetry, which are nine Parts in ten, take their Opinions of Poets and their Works, little believing, or once imagining, that theſe Perſons are of all Mankind the very worſt qualify'd to judge of their own Art; as having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Capacity, nor the Impartiality which are requiſite for the judging truly. For it will be found, generally ſpeaking, that Poets, Painters, and Muſicians, are capacitated leſs than other Men to judge of Poetry, Painting and Muſick. This, I muſt confeſs, may appear to ſome to be ſo bold a Paradox, that I ſhall endeavour to make it out both by Reaſon and Authority, tho' I know very well at the ſame time, that You can make no Doubt of it. The Generality of Poets, Painters and Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are ſuch by the meer Power of a warm Imagination. And 'tis very rarely that a ſtrong Imagination and a penetrating Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are found in the ſame Subject. We need go no further than <hi>Boileau</hi> to hear
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0826500101:104"/>
that a celebrated Poet is often a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Judge.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Tel excelle a Rimer qui Juge ſottement,</l>
               <l>Et tel s'eſt fait par ſes Vers diſtinguer par la ville,</l>
               <l>Qui jamais du Lucain n'a diſtingue Virgile.</l>
            </q>
            <p>As for what relates to Painters, I ſhall content my ſelf with the Citation of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark from the ingenious and judicious Author of the Obſervations upon <hi>Freſnoy</hi>'s Art of Painting, tranſlated by Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> 'Tis the Fiftieth Remark, upon theſe Words of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Tranſlation, 'As being the 'Sovereign Judge of his own Art.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">This Word, Sovereign Judge or Arbiter of his own Art, pre-ſuppoſes a Painter to be fully inſtructed in all the Parts of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that being ſet as it were above his Art, he may be the Maſter and Sovereign of it, which is no eaſie Matter. Thoſe of that Profeſſion are ſo ſeldom endow'd with that ſupream Capacity, that few of them arrive to be good Judges of Painting: And I ſhould many times make more account of their Judgment who are Men of Senſe, and yet have never touch'd a Pencil, than of the Opinion which is given by the greateſt part of Painters. All Painters therefore may be call'd Arbiters of their own Art, but to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0826500101:105"/>
be Sovereign Arbiters belongs only to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Painters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What is ſaid by this ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Painters, is exactly true of Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For which I have the Opinion of more than one Maſter among them; and as to the Truth of this Obſervation with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Poets, I have ſaid enough above.</p>
            <p>But as Poets are not capable, ſo neither are they impartial Judges. I ſpeak of thoſe who are only Rhimeſters. For a great Maſter is for the moſt part as impartial as he is knowing; but for the reſt, the Readers of Poetry would do well to conſider, that if a Miſtreſs who is courted by a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſionate Rivals, ſhould ask any one of them his Opinion of the reſt, 'tis ten to one that he would prefer him moſt, whom he eſteem'd leaſt, and whom he believ'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſt capable of getting that Miſtreſs from him.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, have I acquainted you with the Motive which oblig'd me to write the greater Part of theſe Treatiſes, and which afterwards engag'd me to publiſh them in the two Volumes, which you will receive with this. I hope I ſhall not be thought troubleſome, if in a ſecond Letter I ſay ſomething in particular of the Pieces both in Verſe and Proſe. However theſe two Letters will at leaſt convince you of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0826500101:106"/>
good Opinion which I have a long time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd both of your Diſcernment and your Impartiality.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Had ſooner returned you my Thanks for the favour of your laſt, and the good Advice in it, if I had not entertain'd ſome Thoughts of waiting on you; which I had certainly done before now, if it had not been for the Reflection, that here of late you are ſcarce any where to be found but in <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi>; and what good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an would go to a Place where he is ſure to meet the Devil at every Turn that he takes there? not indeed with his Infernal Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, his Brow-antlers, his Saucer Eyes, his long Tail, and his cloven Feet: He wears nothing of all this in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> except ſometimes his Horns. But then I ſhould meet him at every Turn in more frightful and more provoking Appearances, as now in the Shape of a Roguiſh leering
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0826500101:108"/>
Broker, and anon like a ghaſtly ruin'd Stock-Jobber; ſometimes in the Shape of a young Lady who has loſt both the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and the natural Deſire of her Sex; and ſometimes I ſhould ſee him in the ſame Shape in which he fell from Heav'n, that is like a Star of the firſt magnitude ſhining in an azure Sky. For that old Gentleman, who underſtands his Intereſt better than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mortal living, frequents no one Spot on the <hi>Globe</hi> ſo much as <hi>Exchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Alley:</hi> For there he conſtantly finds new Occaſion to exerciſe his old Talents, his Tempting, Lying, Deluding and Betraying.</p>
            <p>I ſhew'd the Acclamation at the latter end of your Letter to a Friend, who was with me when it came. <hi>Vive la Mer pacifique!</hi> What, ſays he, does this come from a Sharper? I deſir'd to know what made him ask that Queſtion. You know, ſaid he, that there are two conſtant Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard Tables or Wheels of Fortune that are eſtabliſh'd by Authority in this wicked Town, not to mention a third, which is ſometimes at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> but tranſitory and occaſional; that one of theſe two is in the neighbourhood of <hi>White-Hall,</hi> eſtabliſh'd by the Authority of the Court, and the other near the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> eſtabliſh'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Authority. Now the Table in the Neighbourhood of <hi>White-Hall</hi> is a fair and impartial one, at which only Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0826500101:109"/>
play; at leaſt they are Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour while they are there, whatever they may be when they are in other Places. But the Hazard Table near the <hi>Exchange</hi> is frequented by the greateſt Sharpers about this tricking Town. There are Bullies to be ſeen every Day in Crowds with their Boxes and their falſe Dice: ſometimes they make uſe of High Runners, ſometimes of Low Runners, and ſometimes of Doctors. And this their Sharping and their Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is Chriſten'd forſooth their Being in the Secret. So that Being in the Secret will ſhortly come to ſignifie ſomething more ſcandalous even than open Infamy.</p>
            <p>Well but, ſaid I, even at that tricking Table, my Friend plays upon the Square, and is in no Secret. But then, ſaid he, let me ask you another Queſtion, Is your Friend a Lover of his Country? That is a ſtranger Queſtion than the other, ſaid I. Every one is a Lover of his Country, or at leaſt every one pretends to be ſo. But, replyed he, can any one who would be ſo much as thought to love his Country ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſo heartily of a Method, which if 'tis practiſed much longer will infallibly ruin it? For beſides that Strangers run away with vaſt Sums of our Money, who came in at Seventy perhaps, and go out at Seven Hundred; is not our Trade by this Stock-Jobbing brought to a narrower Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs?
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0826500101:110"/>
They who are ruin'd by it are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to carry on their Commerce; and they who have gain'd vaſt Sums by it, have been apt to think themſelves above their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and laugh at the getting ten or twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> by a long Voyage, when in <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> they can propoſe to gain fifty <hi>per Cent.</hi> in a Morning. Now as our Trade decreaſes, continued he, our Seamen muſt decreaſe proportionably, ſo that at laſt perhaps it will be impoſſible upon an exigence to Man our Royal Navy: And then we may happen to become a Prey to the firſt Invader. So that this Lover of his Country is heartily approving of a Method, which may one Day bring this Iſland to be a conquered Province, and his own Poſterity to be wretched Slaves. As ſoon as I perceived that he paus'd, I told him that this would have been more <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi> if he had ſpoke it before the late Act of Parliament for the putting down of the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. But he anſwer'd they being put down by the Wiſdom of the Legiſlature, for this very Reaſon, leaſt any Prejudice ſhould acrue to Trade from them, and <hi>Ram</hi>'s and <hi>Onſlow</hi>'s Bubbles being eſtabliſh'd by the ſame Wiſdom, have not the Legiſlature plainly declared, that Trade could receive no Damage from them; and that we may deliver to the Winds our fears of Conqueſt and of Slavery? Ought not every one to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0826500101:111"/>
acquieſce in what they have done, and can any one be extravagant enough to believe, that they would eſtabliſh two Bubbles againſt the Publick Good, only for the ſake of a little tranſitory Pelf, which is to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to particular Hands? Very good, ſaid my Friend but are not thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who conſtantly frequent <hi>Exchange-Ally</hi> actually Slaves already, as errant, as vile, as miſerable Slaves as thoſe who rowe in the Galleys? Say'ſt thou ſo, my dear Friend? ſaid I: do but make that out, and thou ſhalt to me be <hi>Apollo</hi> and all the Muſes. But this is a new Paradox. Not ſo new neither, ſaid he. The whole Sect of the Stoicks embraced it. The Stoicks, I told him, were fantaſtical People. In ſome things he allow'd they were ſo; but that, for the moſt part, their Morality was more ſound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But my dear Friend, ſaid I, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a <hi>Roman</hi> Poet will hardly bring the Gentlemen in <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> off from their Stock-Jobbing. This is an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he reply'd, which carries Reaſon along with it. For thus he argues. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Man deſires; he who deſires, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence fears; but he who lives in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fear, muſt, in my Opinion, be always an errant Slave. But, continued he, I will add my own Reaſons to thoſe of <hi>Horace.</hi> There are two ſorts of Liberties, ſaid he, a Civil and a Philoſophical Liberty. What we call Civil Liberty gives us the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our own Actions: What we call Philoſophical Liberty gives us the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our own Thoughts. Now nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Galley-ſlave nor the Stock-Job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be can be ſaid to enjoy Civil Liberty, that is, neither the one nor the other has the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his own Actions: For a Galley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Slave muſt Row, and a Stock-Jobber muſt Stock-Jobb. And it ſignifies nothing to the purpoſe, that the one, upon his Refuſal or upon his Neglect, is corrected by a Cat of Nine-tayls, and the other by the Stings of his own baſe Paſſion, ſince they are both
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0826500101:113"/>
equally under Compulſion; and the Stock-Jobber, though never ſo wealthy, is as much afraid of miſſing the Hours of <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s or of <hi>Garroway</hi>'s, as the poor Galley-ſlave is of being wanting to his turn at the Oar. But now to come to Philoſophical Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in that the Galley-ſlave has infinitely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Advantage of the Stock-Jobber. For while the former is chain'd to his Oar, his Thoughts may be as free as the Air, his Thoughts may wander o'er the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, may wander through Eternity, and while his Body is in the utmoſt Agitation, his Mind may be calm and compos'd.

his Poſt, the noble Poſt of Virtue where his General placed him, and which it was his Duty to maintain at the Expence of Life it ſelf. He has loſt it, he has been beaten out of it, by his baſe Paſſions and by his abject Vices, by his Fraud, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, his Hope, his Fear and his Rage. The Galley-ſlave may have it firmly in his Mind and in his Will to do all the Duties of the beſt of Men; to be a faithful Lover of his Country and to ſerve it to the utmoſt of his power; to be a good Father, a good Son, a good Husband, a good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he may be dear to all his Friends and Relations, and have the heartieſt kindeſt Wiſhes of all. But as the miſerable Stock-Jobber cares only for himſelf, he is dear to himſelf alone, and contemptible and hateful to all beſides; and one may ſay to him, in the Words of <hi>Horace,</hi>

            </q>
            <p>For a true Stock-Jobber will ſacrifice Wife, Father, Child, Brother, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try it ſelf, for Gain. He who ſacrifice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0826500101:115"/>
the latter will ſacrifice the reſt. And have we not a thouſand Inſtances every Day that a Stock-Jobber will ſacrifice his Country?</p>
            <p>But there is ſtill another thing in which the Galley-ſlave has by much the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Stock-Jobber. The former is a redeemable Slave, but the latter is in Chains for his Life. Fortune or Time may releaſe the Slaves who are at <hi>Algiers</hi> or <hi>Tripoli,</hi> but Fortune and Time are both the Stock-Jobbers Foes. Length of Days will certainly augment his Avarice and make his Captivity ruder. And the more Wealth there ſhall chance to flow in upon him, the more will he deſire, the leſs will he enjoy, and ſtill the more abject a Slave will he be to the baſe Luſt of Gold. But, my dear Friend, ſaid I, who had heard him hitherto with Patience, Thou certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believ'ſt that thou art in a Pulpit, for it is there that, right or wrong, a Man has the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of talking for an Hour without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrupted. Sir, ſaid he, I ſtand cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, but I did not deſerve this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance only for complying with your own Deſire. You know very well that 'tis not my cuſtom to talk all, and that I have more than once ſuffered you to Preach in your turn. No Man, he continued, has a worſe Opinion than I have of an eternal Talker. That which makes him ſo inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0826500101:116"/>
is, that tho' he is for the moſt part a very empty Coxcomb, yet he implicitely declares that, into what Company ſoever he lights, he alone has more Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than all the reſt of the Company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; that Nature has qualified him to preſcribe to others, and that God who made him created him perpetual Dictator. But as I know you, continued he, to be ſometimes an errant Wag, with a very grave Countenance, I am perhaps very much in the wrong to take what you ſay ſeriouſly. I leave you to ruminate on what I have told you, and ſhall expect to know your Opinion of it the next time I ſee you. So we parted. But before I give him my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion I deſire to know yours.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0826500101:118"/>
at your Houſe on the 28th, and after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to read the Tragedy of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> to you, which I had alter'd from <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi> You cannot but remember, Sir, that upon reading it, the Play with the Alterations was approv'd of, nay and warmly approv'd of, by your ſelf, Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> (the other Manager was not there) and that Reſolutions were taken for the acting it in the beginning of this Winter. Now I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your ſelf, if any Dramatick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance could be more ſeaſonable in the beginning of a Winter, when we were threatned with an Invaſion from <hi>Sweden</hi> on the North, and from <hi>Spain</hi> on the Weſt, than a Tragedy whoſe Moral is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the laſt Lines of the Play.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—They who thro' Ambition or Revenge,</l>
               <l>Or impious Intereſt join with Foreign Foes,</l>
               <l>T' oppreſs or to deſtroy their native Country,</l>
               <l>Shall find, like <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> ſoon or late</l>
               <l>From their perfidious Foreign Friends their Fate.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I am ſure, Sir, I need not tell one of your Underſtanding, that this Moral is ſo apparently the Foundation of the Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Action, and muſt appear to every Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator and Reader to be ſo truly the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Reſult of it, that if I had not ſaid one Word of it, every Reader and Spectator
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0826500101:119"/>
would have been able to have ſuggeſted ſo much to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Well, Sir! when the Winter came on, what was done by your Deputies? Why, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of keeping their Word with me, they ſpent above two Months of the Seaſon in getting up <hi>All for Love, or the World well loſt,</hi> a Play which has indeed a noble firſt Act, an Act which ends with a Scene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of the Dignity of the Tragick Stage. But if <hi>Horace</hi> had been now alive, and been either a Reader or Spectator of that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, he would have paſſed his old Sentence upon the Author.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Infelix operis ſummâ quia ponere totum </l>
               <l>Neſciet.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For was ever any thing ſo pernicious, ſo immoral, ſo criminal, as the Deſign of that Play? I have mention'd the Title of it, give me leave to ſet before you the two laſt Lines:</p>
            <q>
               <l>And Fame to late Poſterity ſhall tell,</l>
               <l>No Lovers liv'd ſo great, or dy'd ſo well.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And this Encomium of the Conduct and the Death of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſo immoral, and a Self-murder ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, is, to give it more Force, put into the Mouth of the High-Prieſt of <hi>Iſis</hi>; tho'
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0826500101:120"/>
that Prieſt could not but know, that what he thus commended, would cauſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the utter Deſtruction of his Country, and make it become a Conquer'd and a <hi>Roman</hi> Province. Certainly never could the Deſign of an Author ſquare more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with the Deſign of <hi>White-Hall,</hi> at the time when it was written, which was by debauching the People abſolutely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave them.</p>
            <p>For, pray Sir, what do the Title and the two laſt Lines of this Play amount to in plain <hi>Engliſh?</hi> Why to this, that if any Perſon of Quality or other ſhall turn away his Wife, his young, affectionate, virtuous, charming Wife (for all theſe <hi>Octavia</hi> was) to take to his Bed a looſe abandon'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, and ſhall in her Arms exhauſt his Patrimony, deſtroy his Health, emaſculate his Mind, and loſe his Reputation and all his Friends, why all this is well and greatly done, his Ruine is his Commendation. And if afterwards in Deſpair, he either hangs or drowns himſelf, or goes out of the World like a Rat, with a Doſe of Arſenick or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate, why 'tis a great and an envied Fate, he dies nobly and heroically. It is, Sir, with extream Reluctance that I have ſaid all this. For I would not be thought to affront the Memory of Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> for whoſe extraordinary Qualities no Man has a greater Veneration than my ſelf. But
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0826500101:121"/>
that all Conſiderations ought to give Place to the Publick Good, is a Truth of which you, of all Men, I am ſure, can never doubt.</p>
            <p>And can you believe then, after having recommended Virtue and Publick Spirit for ſo many Years to the World, that you can give your Subalterns Authority to preach up Adultery to a Town, which ſtands ſo little in need of their Doctrine? Is not the Chaſtity of the Marriage Bed one of the chief Incendiaries of Publick Spirit, and the Frequency of Adulteries one of the chief Extinguiſhers of it; according to that of <hi>Horace</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Foecunda culpae ſecula, nuptias</l>
               <l>Primum inquinavere, &amp; Genus, &amp; Domos,</l>
               <l>Hoc Fonte derivata clades</l>
               <l>In patriam populumque fluxit.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For when Adultery's become ſo frequent, eſpecially among Perſons of Condition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe Sentiments all Publick Spirit chiefly depends, that a great many Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands begin to believe, or perhaps but to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that they who are called their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not their own; I appeal to you, Sir, if that Belief or that Suſpicion muſt not exceedingly cool their Zeal for the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of thoſe Children, and conſequently for the Welfare of Poſterity.</p>
            <p>As I had infinitely the Advantage of <hi>All</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0826500101:122"/>
               <hi>for Love</hi> in the Moral of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> I had it by Conſequence in the whole Tragedy; for the <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> as I have alter'd it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a juſt Moral, and by Conſequence at the Bottom a general and allegorical Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and univerſal and allegorical Characters, and for that very reaſon a Fable, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a true Tragedy, if it be not a juſt and a regular one; but 'tis as juſt and as regular as I could make it, upon ſo irregular a Plan as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s: Whereas <hi>All for Love</hi> having no Moral, and conſequently no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and allegorical Action, nor general and allegorical Characters, can for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have no Fable, and therefore can be no Tragedy. 'Tis indeed only a particular Account of what happen'd formerly to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and a moſt pernicious Amuſement.</p>
            <p>And as I had the Advantage in the Merit of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> I had it likewiſe in the World's Opinion of the Merit and Reputation of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> in Tragedy above that of Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> For let Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Genius for Tragedy be what it will, he has more than once publickly own'd, that it was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s, and particularly in thoſe two remarkable Lines in his Prologue to <hi>Aurenge-Zebe.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>And when he hears his Godlike <hi>Romans</hi> rage, </l>
               <l>He in a juſt Deſpair would quit the Stage.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0826500101:123"/>And in the Verſes to Sir <hi>Godfrey Kneller.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> thyGift, I place before my Sight;</l>
               <l>With Awe, I ask his Bleſſing ere I write;</l>
               <l>With Reverence look on his majeſtick Face,</l>
               <l>Proud to be leſs, but of his Godlike Race.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And the ſame Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has more than once declar'd to me, that there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this very Tragedy of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> as it was writ by <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> that is truly great and truly <hi>Roman</hi>; and I more than once anſwer'd him, that it had always been my own Opinion. Now I appeal to you and your Managers, if it has loſt any thing under my Hands.</p>
            <p>But what is more conſiderable than all this, your Deputy Lieutenants for the Stage have ten times the Opinion of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has over Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in Tragedy, than either I or the reſt of the World have. Ever ſince I was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reading <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> I have always had and have always expreſt that Veneration for him, which is juſtly his due; of which I believe no one can doubt, who has read the Eſſay which I publiſh'd ſome Years ago upon his Genius and Writings. But what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon all Occaſions, is not Eſteem, is not Admiration, but flat Idolatry.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I had the Advantage of the very Opinion which thoſe People had of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0826500101:124"/>
their own Intereſt in the Caſe. They knew very well that it was but twelve Years ſince <hi>All for Love</hi> had been acted. And they were likewiſe ſatisfied, that from its firſt Run, as they call, to the beginning of this laſt Winter, it had never brought four Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences together. At the ſame time there was no Occaſion to tell them, that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> had not been acted in twenty Years, and that when it was brought upon the Stage twenty Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, it was acted twenty Nights together.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I ſhall be oblig'd to you, if you will acquaint me, for what mighty and unknown Reaſon, the <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding yours and their warm Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, notwithſtanding your Words ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly given to act it, as ſoon as it could conve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niently be brought upon the Stage this Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, notwithſtanding the Merit of the Play it ſelf, I ſpeak of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s part of it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the World's and their own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the ſuperior Merit of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> to Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in Tragedy; and their very Opinion of their own Intereſt in the Caſe, nay notwithſtanding the exact Seaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Moral for the Service of King <hi>George</hi> and of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which above all things ought to have been conſider'd by thoſe who call themſelves the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and who act under his Authority: I ſay, Sir, I ſhould be extremely oblig'd to

you, if you would tell me what powerful Reaſon could ſo far prevail over all thoſe I have mention'd, as to engage them to poſtpone the <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> not only for <hi>All for Love,</hi> but likewiſe for that lamentable Tragick Farce <hi>Caezar Borgia,</hi> from which no Body expected any thing but themſelves; and a Comedy after it call'd <hi>the Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,</hi> from which they themſelves declar'd they expected nothing.</p>

            <head>TO Mr. PENKETHMAN.</head>
            <p>I Had certainly call'd upon thee at <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> before now, if it had not been for the Eaſterly Winds, which made the coming by Water impracticable to one who is indiſpos'd, by reaſon of the cold attending them. But thou haſt no reaſon to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at my Delay. For this is no time to write waggiſh Letters to his Grace. In the mean while I have thought of a Project for thee, which will certainly do thy Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thou ſhalt e'en turn Author, and write a Play. Thou wilt tell me perhaps that thou art not qualified. For that very Reaſon thou ſhalt write one, becauſe for that very Reaſon thou wilt certainly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. But perhaps thou wilt tell me that thou ſhalt write a very damn'd Play indeed. A ſtronger Reaſon ſtill for thy Writing. For the more damnable thy Play happens to be,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0826500101:127"/>
the greater and more flaming will thy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs be. And ſo, like a modern Author, or a modern Female Beggar, thou ſhalt ſupply thy own infinite Wants, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wants of thy Offspring. But why art thou not qualified, Friend <hi>Pinky</hi>? There are now-a-days but three Qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the ſucceeding upon the Stage. The firſt is the want of that ſame. For thou know'ſt the Belly is <hi>Ingenii largitor.</hi> The ſecond Qualification is, that as modern Criticks when they come to a new Play are never without a Cat-call, a modern Poet who writes ſuch a Play ſhould never be without a Fool-call. He muſt have the knack of jugging Fools into a Pit, as a Country Squire does Partridges into a Trammel. The third Qualification, and which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the inforcing the other two, is what they call a Stock, a very great Stock; not a Stock of Silver, nor yet of Gold, but of a Metal more powerful than either, and which commands them both. Now upon the Foot of theſe three Qualifications, who the Devil is half ſo well qualified for the writing a Comedy as thou art? Is it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>John Little-wit,</hi> or <hi>Scribble Daſh</hi> the Inns of <hi>Chancery</hi> Bard? Or the Czar's old Soldier? Friend <hi>Pinky,</hi> thou art never mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt but in the wrong Place. Why none of theſe are worthy to carry thy Cloak after thee, and hardly worthy to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0826500101:128"/>
carry thy Friend <hi>Tom</hi>

They never endeavour to make us laugh but they move Terror and Compaſſion. Their very Offer at a Jeſt moves Terror, and 'tis no ſooner out, but it moves Compaſſion. But as for thee, thou haſt nothing to do but to write a long Part for thy ſelf, and then, if thou haſt no Jeſt in thy <hi>Chit Chat,</hi> thou wilt have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual one in thy Perſon, and that will do thy Buſineſs.</p>

If we had not a more than common Eſteem and Reſpect for you, we ſhould certainly envy you, for drawing down into the Country the nobleſt Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Town.

            <p>I Have here the Honour to ſend Your Lordſhip the Abſtract of that Propoſal, which I laid before you about the middle of the laſt Seſſions of Parliament. I did not think fit to remind Your Lordſhip of it before, becauſe tho' you might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of it, it was then too late for the Parliament to go through it, and beſides I had ſome Apprehenſion that that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not enter into it.</p>
            <p>My Lord, at preſent I humbly conceive, with all imaginable Submiſſion to your Lordſhip's Judgment, that the bringing this Propoſal to Practice would be highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and perhaps neceſſary; abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0826500101:134"/>
neceſſary, if the War is like to be of any long continuance, and highly conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent though it ſhould be like to have a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy end: Becauſe in this laſt Caſe, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive that we ſhould have a better and more ſolid Peace than we ſhould have without it. For nothing, with Submiſſion to your Lordſhip's Judgment, would more alarm the <hi>French</hi> than the reducing this Propoſal to Practice. For ſince they have but two ways of ſucceeding in their Deſigns againſt theſe Nations, which are the Dividing us at Home, and the ruining our Commerce Abroad; they would loſe the very Hope of Succeſs, if they ſhould ſee themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in both, to which the bringing this Propoſal to Practice would contribute not a little. I have been told by ſo many underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding People, that the general Inſurance, which is a part of this Propoſal, would bring in ſuch conſiderable Sums into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> as would make it equivalent to almoſt any other Tax, that I can hardly doubt of it. My Lord, I humbly conceive that it would have ſome Advantages above all other Taxes. For as far as I am able to make a Judgment upon a four Years ſcrutiny, 'tis a Tax that is very much deſir'd even after ſo long a War, and which is remarkable, it is moſt earneſtly deſir'd by thoſe who are to pay the Money, becauſe by this Tax ſomething would be done for them preferably to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0826500101:135"/>
the reſt of the People, which cannot be ſaid of any other Tax; and whereas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by all other Taxes both Trade and the ordinary conſtant Revenue are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably diminiſh'd, they would not only be both improv'd and augmented by this, but the national Stock encreas'd, and the whole Confederacy ſtrengthned and bound indiſſolubly. I ſhall have the Honour of waiting on your Lordſhip ſuddenly to know your Pleaſure in this Affair. If your Lordſhip encourages me to lay this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal before the Houſe of Commons, I ſhall prepare an Appendix, by which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I can ſatisfie that Honourable Houſe, that the Advantages mention'd both in the Propoſal at large, and in the Abſtract, will really accrue to us from putting that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in Practice.</p>

            <head>TO Mr. GEORGE SEWEL,</head>
            <head type="sub">On the Preface to a Comedy call'd the MASQUERADE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have lately read over the Preface to a certain comical Rhapſody, with an odd mixture of Laughter and Indignation, upon which I ſhall here ſend you ſome Remarks that were made in a curſory manner. He pretends to turn your own Canon upon you, but he has done it to ſo fine a purpoſe that it has recoil'd with violence upon himſelf, and quite demoliſh'd the paltry Works he has rais'd. For what confounded Sot will read any thing of an Author who is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of writing ſuch a Preface? Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> tells us in his Preface to the <hi>Medal,</hi> that upon his writing <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> he met with juſt ſuch Adverſaries. What Reflections he makes upon that notable way of proceeding, you will find in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0826500101:137"/>
foreſaid Preface. But to return to that of our Author.</p>
            <p>He has very little Inclination, he ſays, to write Prefaces; becauſe, I ſuppoſe, 'tis not ſo eaſie to ſteal Prefaces as Plays. However, as difficult as 'tis, he has brought it about. He has boldly ſeiz'd upon yours, and boaſts of it as Plunder inſtead of Theft.</p>
            <p>He neither commends nor defends the Play; which would be to waſte his Breath, in commending <hi>Shirly</hi> and <hi>Taverner</hi>: But he ſpends his borrow'd Preface in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Actors, who vouchſaf'd to be the Receivers and Venders of his ſtolen Goods. His <hi>Maſquerade,</hi> he ſays, owes all his Succeſs to them. And here the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick which others beſtow upon ſome one ſubſtantial Patron, he is for retailing among a Company of Actors, which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes among them at ſo ſurpriſing a rate, that not a Mortal of them can pretend to any Share of it. For firſt, the Succeſs of this Play is owing to the juſt Performance of the Players in general; then 'tis parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly owing to the Grace, which, with her uſual Excellence, Mrs. <hi>Oldfield</hi> gave to her Part. Indeed no one who has had the Happineſs to know Mrs. <hi>Oldfield,</hi> can in the leaſt doubt of her being qualified when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe pleaſes to give extraordinary Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by her Parts. But now to ſhew that Fools as well as Children are for Boys Play,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0826500101:138"/>
this Perſon the very next Moment reſumes the Commendation which he ſo very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly granted to the Company in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſo very juſtly to Mrs. <hi>Oldfield</hi> in particular; and to ſhew his old Inclination to Arbitrary Power, pretends to make a freſh Grant of it for the ſole uſe of Maſter <hi>Robert Wilks. The Succeſs of this Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is owing entirely to Maſter</hi> Robert. Well! I have read many a groſs, fulſome, flattering Fool, but I never read any one before, who was Fool enough to own, that he flatter'd groſsly and fulſomly. For when he tells Mr. <hi>Robert Wilks,</hi> that the Succeſs of the Play is entirely due to him, and in the ſame Breath tells the whole Company 'tis due to them, and in the ſame Breath tells Mrs. <hi>Oldfield</hi> that 'tis very particularly due to her; what does he do but laugh in Maſter <hi>Robert</hi>'s Face, and tell him, that he takes him for the erranteſt Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that ever was bit at Bob-cherry. But now to ſhew that this Fellow is more Fool than Knave, and that he does not flatter on this Occaſion ſo much as he thinks he does, and owns that he does, I will venture to bring him off a little; nay I will venture to ſhew, that when he ſays the Succeſs of the Play is entirely due to Mr. <hi>Robert Wilks,</hi> he does not flatter at all. For I have heard a grave Bird ſing, that if it had not been for him alone, the <hi>Maſquerade</hi> had never

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Remember very well, that before I went out of Town in <hi>June</hi> laſt, I promis'd in a ſhort time to give you ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the late <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>. I make no doubt but that you have long before this time accus'd me of Breach of Promiſe. But if you did but know what charming Places I have been in, ſince I ſaw you laſt; and what damnable Company, for the moſt part, I have kept in them; how my Life has been chequer'd between Rapture and Chagrin, and conſequently unable to turn it ſelf to Buſineſs; did you but know this, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident you would not blame me. Beſides, I conſider'd that Authors as well as Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foggers ought to have long Vacation, and that it was but reaſonable that the World ſhould once a Year enjoy an Interval from being plagu'd with either; that it was highly expedient, that Minds ſometimes ſhould lye

Fallow as well as Fields, as well as thoſe Human Bodies which they inform; that they who are too often in the Act of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, produce but weak and puny Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings, and peradventure none; and that the Scriblers and common Whores of that vile Town ſeldom beget any thing, unleſs ſomething by Chance, that, like a <hi>Dutch Sooterkin,</hi> is at once frightful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, as all Monſters are. Beſides, I thought it a Duty to my ſelf, to recruit thoſe Spirits, by a pleaſing Indolence, which a long Misfortune had almoſt exhauſted. And if at any time, in ſpight of theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Reflections, I reſolv'd to ſet hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily about the Performance of my Promiſe, I immediately ſtarted at the Thought of what I was about to undertake. For to make Remarks upon this <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Beſides, the Faults in it are ſo frequent and ſo groſs, that every Fool may find them; and a Man cannot value him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or expect that the reaſonable Part of the World ſhould value him for his Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or Penetration, on the account of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0826500101:142"/>
that I have taken all imaginable Care, and have kept the moſt watchful Guard upon my ſelf, that I might neither endeavour to deceive you thro' Malice, nor be my ſelf deceiv'd thro' Prejudice. But ſince perhaps you, or ſomebody to whom you may ſhew this Letter, may be of another Opinion, I ſhall ſend you in a Day or two ſome Obſervations upon the firſt; which little may be enough to ſhew all the Beaſt.

And therefore the Mountebank finds his Account better in being Itinerant.

For Rabble is a moſt comprehenſive Word, Doctor, and includes not only pitiful poor Mechanicks, and wretched Rogues in Rags, but many, nay very many Perſons, who are diſtinguiſh'd by Fortune and dignified by Princes. This comprehenſive Word, Doctor, includes all who want Underſtanding and Virtue. And ſo for Example the Rabble round the <hi>Wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi> includes not only the Butchers, the Tinkers, the Weavers and the Tailors of the adjacent Towns and Counties, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten likewiſe, too often, the Mayor, the

Sheriff, the Alderman and the Doctor, I mean the Mountebank both Spiritual and Secular; for every one who ſeeks the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of Rabble is himſelf moſt certainly Rabble; but how Emphatically, Doctor, are they Rabble, who are the Admirers and the Applauders of Rabble!</p>

this once in the right. I know indeed very well, that <hi>miſer</hi> and <hi>miſellus</hi> were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times among the <hi>Romans</hi> Terms of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.

Now tho' <hi>miſer</hi> was ſometimes us'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> to expreſs both the one and the other Tenderneſs, yet, in my Opinion, it can never be tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the Word <hi>Wretch</hi> in any but the Comick way; <hi>Wretch</hi> in a ſerious Senſe being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, if I am not miſtaken, a Term of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or Contempt: And conſequently the Terms <hi>Excellent Wretch,</hi> being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent and contradictory, make the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſurd, and the Expreſſion Nonſenſe. This is my Opinion at preſent, but I know not how long it will be ſo, becauſe I have not as yet heard yours.</p>
            <p>But that is not the only Point in which I deſire it. I am told lately by one of my
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0826500101:154"/>
Acquaintance, that I have been too ſevere upon the Underſtanding of another of the Managers, and that is of <hi>Cibber.</hi> And the Reaſon that was given me was, that <hi>Cibber</hi> writ <hi>the Fool in Faſhion,</hi> which, ſays my Friend, you have often ſaid is a good Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. To which I anſwer, that 'tis true, I have often ſaid 'tis a good Comedy, but I had always much ado to believe that <hi>Cib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> writ it, and that ſince I have ſeen the <hi>Nonjuror</hi> and the <hi>Heroick Daughter</hi> I do not believe it at all. For which I ſhall give my Reaſons, and afterwards deſire to know from you how convincing they appear to you.</p>
            <p>When <hi>the Fool in Faſhion</hi> was firſt act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Cibber</hi> was hardly twenty Years of Age. Now could he at the Age of twenty write a Comedy with a juſt Deſign, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Characters, and a proper Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, who now at forty treats us with <hi>Hibernian</hi> Senſe and <hi>Hibernian Engliſh?</hi> Could he, when he was an arrant Boy, draw a good Comedy, from his own raw uncultivated Head, who is now at forty able to do nothing but what is poor and mean, when he is ſupported by two ſuch Maſters as <hi>Moliere</hi> and <hi>Corneille?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have often obſerv'd to you, that there is not in his <hi>Heroick Daughter</hi> one Spark of the Force and noble Spirit of <hi>Corneille.</hi> As for <hi>Moliere,</hi> I am ſatisfied that he knows

               </gap>hat Title was to be acted, I wiſh'd it as much Succeſs as <hi>Cibber</hi> did, upon account of the Cauſe in which it was writ. But I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Month, during which time I was ask'd a hundred Queſtions about it. When I ſaw that the Curioſity of the World was pretty well over, I ſent for the Play and read it. Upon the reading it, I was ſoon confirm'd in ſome of my former Thoughts, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a very good Underſtanding might be impos'd upon at a Repreſentation by the Livelineſs and Grace of Action, and that the Excellence of the Actor often makes amends for the Imperfections of the Author. I ſoon found that there was little in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Comedy of the Beauties of <hi>Moliere.</hi> For <hi>Moliere</hi>'s Characters in his <hi>Tartuffe</hi> are Maſter-pieces, mark'd, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, glowing, bold, touch'd with a fine
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0826500101:156"/>
yet a daring Hand; all of them ſtamp'd with a double Stamp, the one from Art and the other from Nature: No Phantoms but real Perſons, ſuch as Nature produces in all Ages, and Cuſtom faſhions in ours. His Dialogue too is lively, natural, graceful, eaſie, ſtrong, adapted to the Occaſion, adapted to the Characters. In ſhort, 'tis by this Comedy and by the <hi>Miſantrope</hi> that <hi>Moliere</hi> perhaps has born away the Prize of Comedy from all Perſons in all Ages, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Ben. Johnſon</hi> alone. But the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Comedy are moſt of them daub'd and bungled, and the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue nothing but meer Fribble. Now is it barely poſſible that this bungling Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor can be the Author of <hi>the Fool in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion?</hi> Is it barely poſſible that he ſhould have known Mankind and the Stage, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue when he was an errant Boy, who is groſsly ignorant of them all at forty? But <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Name is prefix'd to <hi>the Fool in Faſhion.</hi> They know nothing of Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> who in the leaſt wonder at that. He who, now he is turn'd of Forty, ſets his Name, without any manner of Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Ceremony, to what all the World knows was writ by <hi>Fletcher</hi> and <hi>Dryden,</hi> could not his Vanity, when he was a Boy, prevail upon him to own what an unknown tho' a very ingenious Gentleman writ? Thus have I given you my Reaſons, why I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

            <p>THE laſt of <hi>July</hi> I had the Honour to return an Anſwer to your moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ingenious Letter. I have ſince had the Curioſity to enquire after the Prieſts whom you mention, but have been able to get no Intelligence; from which I conclude, that the Prieſts whom you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be two or three ſcandalous <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi> Curates in your Neighbourhood. But whatever Ill they may ſay of me, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that they do not call me Fool, which implies all other Infamies. For as <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault</hi> ſays, a Fool has not Stuff enough to be good. I will preſume they do not ſay of me, that every Word, that every Action of my Life is a Contradiction to common Honeſty, and to common Senſe; that tho' I am moſt ſordidly intereſted and moſt ridiculouſly proud, I am endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Might and Main to make my ſelf moſt miſerable and moſt deſpicable; that I am labouring with all my Might and with all my Strength to bring in a Tyrant in

            <p>Theſe, Sir, are things which I preſume they do not ſay of me, becauſe theſe are Encomiums which are only worthy of them, and which they have made upon themſelves by their Actions. But becauſe what they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Deſir'd in my laſt that you wou'd be Arbitrator in a Diſpute, which I lately had with Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> concerning ſome Verſes of <hi>Virgil.</hi> The Paſſage is in the 3d Eclogue.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Malo me Galatea petit laſciva puella,</l>
               <l>Et fugit ad ſalices, &amp; ſe cupit antè videri.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now, Sir, Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> affirm'd that the Nymph in acting and the Shepherd in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, meant nothing but Boys and Girls Play. My Opinion is, that ſuch an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation renders the Paſſage wholly flat and inſipid, and fit to pleaſe none but Children; that the Nymph by throwing the Apple, and then running away to the Willows, but at the ſame time taking care that the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0826500101:169"/>
Shepherd ſhould ſee her before ſhe got to them, deſign'd Mans and Womans Play. Now, Sir, you are left to judge which of the Explications is moſt worthy of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and which comes neareſt up to that <hi>Molle</hi> and that <hi>Facetum</hi> which at that time of Day compos'd the Character of <hi>Virgil,</hi> if we will take the Opinion of a very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Critick, and that was his Friend <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>;</p>
            <q>
               <l>Molle atque Facetum</l>
               <l>Virgilio annuerint gaudentes Rure Camaenae.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For where is the <hi>Molle</hi> and the <hi>Facetum</hi> in theſe Verſes, if the Nymph and the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, like Boys and Girls, were only at hide and ſeek? I could as ſoon believe that when <hi>Silenus</hi> in the Sixth Eclogue ſays, ſpeaking of <hi>Aegle, Huic aliud mercedis erit,</hi> he only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to preſent her with a Pair of Gloves. I know indeed very well, that <hi>Ruaeus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets <hi>Laſciva</hi> by <hi>Jocoſa Puella.</hi> But it ought to be conſider'd, that <hi>Ruaeus</hi> was a Prieſt and that the Dauphin was young, and that it was the Buſineſs and Duty of the Jeſuit to conceal from his young Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil the Lubricity of the Poet's meaning. Nor is <hi>Laſciva</hi> us'd upon this occaſion, tho' 'tis taken in the common Senſe ſo very different from <hi>Jocoſa Puella,</hi> if we conſider that <hi>Homer,</hi> whenever he has occaſion to mention <hi>Venus,</hi> calls her the Laughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0826500101:170"/>
Goddeſs. Beſides, my Antagoniſt does not ſeem enough to conſider either the Nature of Women in general, or of the <hi>Italian</hi> Women in particular, or of the Seaſon when this was ſuppos'd to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which was High Spring, (which is the Seaſon of High Deſire) as <hi>Palaemon</hi> gives us to underſtand a little before this Paſſage in three Verſes, the two laſt of which are beautiful as their Subject.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Dicite; quandoquidem in molli conſedimus herbâ.</l>
               <l>Et nunc omnis ager, nunc omnis parturit arbos:</l>
               <l>Nunc frondent Sylvae, nunc formoſiſſimus annus.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now when we conſider all theſe Things, can we believe that <hi>Virgil,</hi> who was ſo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, ſo wiſe, and who follow'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo cloſely, meant nothing but <hi>Hide and Seek</hi> by his <hi>ſe cupit antè videri.</hi> That which makes this one of the beautifulleſt Paſſages of all the Eclogues, is, that there is a very wanton Meaning expreſs'd in very modeſt Words, and conſequently occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion given to the Reader to ſhew his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment by piercing the Veil which the Poet has thrown over the Nudity; which puts me in mind of a fine Paſſage of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne.

                  <p>The Verſes of theſe two Poets (<hi>meaning</hi> Lucretius <hi>and</hi> Virgil) treating with ſo much Diſcretion and ſo much Reſervedneſs of Laſciviouſneſs, as they treat of it, do, as it were, diſcover more of it, and ſhew it in a better and nearer Light.

            <p>TWenty tedious Years have now been paſt, ſince I had the Honour either to ſee you, or hear from you, or write to you. Tho' I had many a time done the latter, if you had not prevented it by your unkind Prohibition, when, the laſt time I ſaw you, you declared among a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Friends, that you would keep Correſpondendence with no one. But tho', by reaſon of that unkind Declaration, we have a long time reckoned you dead and buried to the World and us, yet we have been far from forgetting you, ſo very far from it, that we have had the more lively Remembrance of you, becauſe we have ſeen no body ſince you left us, who, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling you, could put us in mind of you.

My only Aſſociates in this Place are the ſame that the ingenious <hi>Don Quixote</hi> had at the famous <hi>La Manche, viz.</hi> the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and the Curate. Now the Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I had from the former, and the too great Punctuality of the latter, have been the Occaſion of my Misfortune. For the Barber, who ſhould have come on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> at Three, came not till <hi>Sunday</hi> at Eleven, ſo that there was a Neceſſity of dining before I went. After Dinner in comes the Curate; and invites me to take part of an Eccleſiaſtical Collation in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.

Now Gentlemen of his Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are ſo hearty and ſo frank in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Hoſpitality, that if you do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their preſſing Invitations you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige them for ever. The Sorrow which oppreſs'd me for being diſappointed of the Converſation of a Gentleman whom I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem ſo much, has been in ſome meaſure alleviated by the following Conſiderations. Firſt, the Author whom I have at preſent under Conſideration has ſerv'd me as he deſerves to be us'd himſelf, and has nail'd my Ears to his Book ſo faſt, that I could not without Pain unclinch my ſelf. The ſecond Alleviation is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of my Health. For though the Goddeſs ſmiles upon me here, ſhe has as great an Averſion to old <hi>Sodom</hi> as <hi>Hugh Clodpate</hi> of merry Memory, and might for ought I know ſhake Hands with me at my Entrance into that damn'd Town. I begin to be quite another thing than I was while I ſtaid in the Tower, and there is as much difference between me on my Hill here, and me in my Den at <hi>John Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardſon</hi>'s, as there is between a Lyon on a Mountain in <hi>Africa,</hi> and one near the <hi>Spur-Guard.</hi> Another Comfort that I had was the extraordinary Beauty of the Day.

his Power. If ſhe is but tolerably handſome he gives her to his Friend, but if ſhe is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly fair, he is willing to enjoy her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>This is the third Letter which I have writ to you ſince I heard from you; I hope the other two came to your Hands. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that you would have the Goodneſs to ſend me word, in what Poſture my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are.

            <p>BY your laſt of the 26th you deſire to know my Opinion of the notable Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick upon <hi>Chevy Chaſe</hi> in the <hi>Spectator</hi> of the 21ſt and that of the 25th of this Inſtant; that is, you deſire to know whether I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Author of thoſe two Papers to be in Jeſt or in Earneſt. To which I anſwer, that he is neither in Jeſt nor in Earneſt; not in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, becauſe he does not believe what he ſays; nor in Jeſt, becauſe he does ſtrenuouſly endeavour to convince the Reader of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of that old Dogrel. His Deſign is to ſee how far he can lead his Reader by the Noſe. To give my Reaſons for this Opinion, I ſhall ſend you an Examen of thoſe two <hi>Spectators</hi> in as little Compaſs as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">When I travelled, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I took a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Delight in hearing the Songs and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0826500101:181"/>
Fables that are come from Father to Son, and are moſt in Vogue among the common People of the Countries thro' which I paſſed; for it is impoſſible that any thing ſhould be univerſally taſted and approved by a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, tho' they are only the Rabble of a Nation, which hath not in it ſome peculiar Aptneſs to pleaſe and gratify the Mind of Man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now is there any thing that has the leaſt Air of a Jeſt? On the other ſide, do you think that the Author could be capable of meaning and thinking what he pretends to affirm here? Is it not plain by the laſt Words which I have quoted, <hi>viz. the Mind of Man,</hi> that he intended a Fallacy? For to affirm this of the Mind of Man, as 'tis cultivated and inſtructed, is not only abſurd and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, but contradictory of himſelf. Has not he himſelf obſerved in the 134th <hi>Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that there are Exerciſes and Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which univerſally pleaſe the Rabble, which yet Men of Quality or Education either deſpiſe or abhor? Such are the <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Bear-Garden</hi> Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he there particularizes. I have known a Country Fidler who has been the Delight of three Counties, tho' he could never play the Truth of one Tune; and a Sign-Poſt Painter, who has been the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration not only of the Rabble, but even of moſt of the Squires of the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0826500101:182"/>
I appeal to the Bookſellers, who in this Caſe ought to be Judges without Appeal, whether more of the common People do not approve of <hi>Quarles</hi> and <hi>Bunyan</hi> than eſteem <hi>Chevy Chaſe.</hi> Therefore 'tis plain that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor could not deſign that the Period a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned ſhould run thus,</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">For 'tis impoſſible that any thing ſhould be univerſally taſted and approved of by a Multitude, tho' they are only the Rabble of a Nation, which has not in it ſome peculiar Aptneſs to pleaſe and gratify the Minds of Men of Quality and Education.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And leſs can he deſign to make it run as follows: <q rend="inline">For it is impoſſible that any thing ſhould be univerſally taſted and approv'd of by a Multitude, tho' they are only the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a Nation, which has not in it ſome peculiar aptneſs to pleaſe and gratify the Minds of the Rabble.</q> For to mean this would make, not only what he ſays, but what he is, a Jeſt. So that the Author, by <hi>the Mind of Man,</hi> meaning neither the Mind of Man as it is rude and untaught, nor the Mind of Man as 'tis cultivated and inſtructed, can mean nothing in the World but to try how far he can impoſe upon his Reader. But he goes on.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">Human Nature is the ſame in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, and whatever falls in with it, will meet with Admirers among Readers of all Qualities and Conditions. <hi>Moliere,</hi> as we are told by <hi>Boileau,</hi> us'd
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0826500101:183"/>
to read all his Comedies to a little old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was his Houſe-Keeper, as ſhe ſate at her Work by the Chimney Corner, and could foretel the Succeſs of his Play in his Theatre, from the Reception it met at the Fire Side. For he tells us the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience always follow'd the old Woman, and never failed to laugh in the ſame Place.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now can you, Sir, or any Man of good Senſe believe that the Author does not know better what belongs to a Jeſt, than to take falſe Reaſoning for one; and that he does not know better what belongs to falſe Reaſoning than to mean what he ſays here? Can he be ſo dull and ſo abſurd as not to know how to diſtinguiſh between what Human Nature is, and what Human Nature ſhould be? Human Nature was Human Nature before the Fall, and 'tis Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture now 'tis degenerated from that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Virtue and that unclouded Knowledge, which it enjoy'd before. 'Tis the Buſineſs and Deſign of Education to endeavour to retrieve in ſome meaſure the Loſs that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature has ſuſtain'd by the Fall; and to recover ſome Meaſure of Knowledge and Virtue. Now Heroick Poetry is an Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Human Nature exalted, and Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is an Imitation of Human Nature depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. What can be more abſurd than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that becauſe the Rabble, that is, ſuch as never had any Education, are tolerable Judges of Human Nature depraved, that therefore
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0826500101:184"/>
they are Judges of Human Nature exalted, of which none can be Judges but they who have had the beſt Education? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only the Rabble, but an univerſal Nation has been miſtaken in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Poets and Poetry, when the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made, before that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came to be ſufficiently cultivated.</p>

            <p>And to ſhew you that 'tis impoſſible the <hi>Spectator</hi> can mean what he ſays here, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> declares in the very Verſe which the <hi>Spectator</hi> has choſen for the Motto of his Paper, that the Multitude is as often mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken as it is in the Right.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Interdum Vulgus rectum videt, eſt ubi peccat.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And he ſays particularly, that they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten miſtaken in their Judgments of Verſes which have been writ by their Forefathers.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Si veteres ita miratur laudatque poetas,</l>

            </q>
            <p>Now is not here a Motto very judiciouſly choſen? For from theſe Verſes of <hi>Horace,</hi> we may juſtly make this Obſervation, that a Man by his real Approbation and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Commendation of ſuperannuated Rhimes, not only puts himſelf upon an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Foot with the Rabble, but ev'n of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0826500101:186"/>
moſt injudicious and fooliſh part of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>Horace</hi> was ſo far from being of Opinion, that the univerſal Approbation of the Multitude was the Taſte and Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of good Poetry, that in the laſt Satyr of his firſt Book, he adviſes the Poet of his Formation to take no manner of Care about pleaſing them.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Neque Te, ut miretur turba labores</l>
               <l>Contentus paucis lectoribus.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now this Advice of <hi>Horace</hi> muſt either be impertinent and wrong, or the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Multitude is a Sign of an ill Poem. But 'tis time to ſee how this judicious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor goes on.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">I know nothing that more ſhews the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and inherent Perfection of Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Thought, above that which I call the <hi>Gothick</hi> manner in writing, than this, that the firſt pleaſes all kinds of Palates, and the latter only ſuch as have formed to themſelves a wrong artificial Taſte upon little fanciful Authors and Writers of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams. <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> or <hi>Milton,</hi> ſo far as the Language of their Poems is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, will pleaſe a Reader of plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, that would neither reliſh nor comprehend an Epigram of <hi>Martial,</hi> or a Poem of <hi>Cowley</hi>; ſo on the contrary, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0826500101:187"/>
Song or Ballad that is the Delight of the common People, cannot fail to pleaſe all ſuch Readers as are not unqualified for the Entertainment by their Affectation or their Ignorance, and the Reaſon is plain, becauſe the ſame Paintings of Nature which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the moſt ordinary Reader, will appear beautiful to the moſt refin'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, can any thing be more plain, than that the <hi>Spectator</hi> here cannot mean what he ſays? Becauſe 'tis impoſſible for a Man of common Senſe, much leſs for one of his notable Parts, to be guilty of ſo many Abſurdities as there are in this little Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph. I will make no Objection at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent about the <hi>Gothick</hi> Taſte. I think I have call'd it ſomewhere ſo my ſelf, tho' tis certain that the pointed conceited way of Wit was in Faſhion long before the <hi>Goths</hi> were either a Name or a Nation. For you find it not only in <hi>Florus,</hi> in <hi>Martial,</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> but even in ſome of the Writers of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi>'s Age, as <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Paterculus.</hi> But here are more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Errors to be taken Notice of. For firſt, the <hi>Spectator</hi> would make us believe that all People are Judges of Simplicity of Thought, and that the Rabble are better Judges of it, than they who have had a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Education. That more People compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Excellency of <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> than the Beauties of <hi>Martial</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0826500101:188"/>
and <hi>Cowley,</hi> tho' perhaps there are not ten Perſons living who know all the Merit of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> had been printed forty Years before it was known to the greateſt Part of <hi>England,</hi> that there barely was ſuch a Book. He would further inſinuate, that all thoſe Songs or Ballads, which are the delight of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cannot fail to pleaſe all ſuch Readers as are not unqualified for the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by their Affectation or their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; as if Men of Education in <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> were more ignorant than the Rabble, or it requir'd an extraordinary Stock of Knowledge to comprehend the Excellence of old Dogrel. The Reaſon which he gives for this, and which he ſays is plain, is, becauſe the ſame Paintings of Nature which recommend it to the moſt ordinary Reader, will appear beautiful to the moſt refin'd; as if ſome faint and imperfect Touches of Nature might not recommend a thing to thoſe by reaſon of their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or their Stupidity, know not how far an Author ought to go in ſuch a Caſe to expreſs the Truth of Nature, which faint and imperfect Strokes would by no means ſatisfy thoſe who are able to judge of that Truth.</p>
            <p>Sir, the <hi>Spectator</hi> imagines here, that there is nothing contrary to Simplicity of Thought, but that pointed conceited way
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0826500101:189"/>
of writing which we mention'd above, whereas Simplicity of Thought, is Thought which naturally ariſes from the Subject, Ideas which bear a juſt Proportion to the Things they repreſent, and which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſeems of it ſelf as it were to offer to us, inſtead of our obtruding them upon that. If we truly conſider what Simplicity of Thought in Poetry is, we ſhall find that there are three things which are equally diſtant from it, and thoſe are, Imbecility, Affectation and Extravagance; Imbecility, when a Man wants Force to come up to the Truth of Nature; Affectation, when a Man goes beſide it, thro' Error, Luxury and Wantonneſs of Soul; and Extravagance, when a Man goes beyond it, thro' a falſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll-tim'd Effort to ſhew his Strength and Excellence. We ſhall find too that Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Thought is not ſufficient to make what we call Metre Poetry; that there muſt be likewiſe a Simplicity of Expreſſion; that a Simplicity of Expreſſion is an Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is according to Nature, that is an Expreſſion proportion'd to the Ideas, as they are to the Things, and that conſequently then the Expreſſion in great Subjects, and in great Thoughts is ſimple, when it is paſſionate, figurative, ſounding and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious; and that an Author, who in great Subjects and in great Thoughts ſhews an Expreſſion, which comes ſhort of this,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0826500101:190"/>
ſhews not a Simplicity but an Imbecility of Expreſſion. In ſhort, as all the Heroick Virtues are compatible with Simplicity of Heart, ſo all the Magnificence of the moſt pompous Eloquence is on ſome Occaſions conſiſtent with Simplicity of Style. But now let us ſee a little how the <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> goes on.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">The old Song of <hi>Chevy Chaſe, ſays he,</hi> is the favourite Ballad of the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi>; and <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> us'd to ſay, he had rather have been the Author of it, than of all his Works. Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Poetry, ſpeaks of it in the following Words. I never heard the old Song of <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Douglas,</hi> that I found not my Heart more mov'd than with a Trumpet, and yet it was ſung by ſome blind Crowder with a Voice as rough as his Style, which being ſo evil apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Duſt aad Cobweb of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil Age, what would it work trimm'd in the gorgeous Eloquence of <hi>Pindar</hi>? For my own part, <hi>ſays the <hi>Spectator</hi>,</hi> I am ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed an Admirer of this antiquated Song, that I ſhall give my Reader a Critick upon it, without any further Apology for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, as I ſhew'd you before by his Sophiſtry, that the <hi>Spectator</hi> is not in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; ſo here it may appear by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities he brings that he is not in Jeſt. I am
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0826500101:191"/>
ſo very well convinced of the ſolid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ben. Johnſon,</hi> that if <hi>Ben.</hi> ever talk'd at that rate, (which I will not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utely pretend to deny, tho' I very much doubt it) he only did it to laugh, and to ridicule ſome of the ſottiſh Admirers of that obſolete Song. As for Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> do but obſerve the Expreſſion which that noble Gentleman uſes; he tells us not that his Heart was moved by the Song of <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Douglas</hi> as often as he read it, or heard it read, but as often as he heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſung, nay, tho' it was ſung by an old Crowder. I ſhrewdly ſuſpect that there were ſome martial Notes in this old <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick</hi> Tune, which very much contributed to the working that Effect upon Sir <hi>Philip Sidney.</hi> But inſtead of affirming that Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> has gone too far, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds to inſinuate that he falls too ſhort; for the <hi>Spectator</hi> vindicates the very Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of <hi>Chevy Chaſe,</hi> in which one thing, I ,uſt confeſs, he does ſeem to me to come ſomething near to a Jeſt, and to make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ne ironical Ridicule upon Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> But be theſe things as they will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that thro' the whole Courſe of this Criticiſm I have and ſhall oppoſe greater Authorities to theſe, I ſhall confound them by invincible Reaſon, before which no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority could ever ſtand; and by ſhewing he Nature of Poetry, and what it is that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0826500101:192"/>
conſtitutes the Difference between that and Proſe, ſhall make it appear that the Writer of this old Song, in ſpight of the Applauſe of ſo many Ages, never knew what Poetry was. In order to which, let us give very near the ſame Account of it that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did in the <hi>Grounds of Criticiſm in Poetry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poetry then is an Art, by which a Poet excites Paſſion, (and to that very end en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains Senſe) by a bold and figurative Language, and by meaſur'd harmonious Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, in order to ſatisfy and improve, to delight and reform the Mind, and ſo to make Mankind happier and better.</p>
            <p>Poetry therefore is Poetry, becauſe 'tis more paſſionate and ſenſual than Proſe. A Poet has two ways of exciting Paſſion. The one by the Figurativeneſs, and the other by the Harmony of his Expreſſion; but the Figures contribute more to the exciting of Paſſion than Harmony. A Diſcourſe that is writ in ſmooth and tolerable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if 'tis not figurative can be but mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd Proſe; but a Diſcourſe that is every where bold and figurative, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every where extremely pathetick, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Poetry without Numbers. Beſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this alone is a convincing Proof that a Fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gurative Expreſſion is more eſſential <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Poetry than Harmony, <hi>viz.</hi> that Harmony <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0826500101:193"/>
a figurative Expreſſion; there being no Example among the Antients themſelves of a Raviſhing Poetical Muſick, without figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Language. But as the Language of Poetry in general is to be bold and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, the Language of great and exalted Poetry is to be very bold and figurative. The Doctrine of <hi>Horace</hi> is exactly anſwerable to this.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Primum ego me illorum, dederim quibus eſſe poetas,</l>

            </q>
            <p>For he tells us here three things in a very conſpicuous manner. Firſt, that poetical Meaſures are not ſufficient to conſtitute a Man a Poet.</p>

Secondly, that there muſt be great Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a bold and a figurative Language, nay very bold and very figurative.</p>

            </q>
            <p>And Thirdly, That it was to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned whether any thing but the great and exalted Poetry was properly Poetry.</p>
            <q>

               <l>Eſſet quaeſivere: quod acer Spiritus, ac vis,</l>

            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Boileau</hi> is exactly of the ſame Opinion, and has in his Ninth Satyr as it were interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of this Paſſage of <hi>Horace.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>And in his Eighth Reflection upon <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus,</hi> he tells us plainly that Monſieur <hi>Perrault</hi> having tranſlated the beginning
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0826500101:195"/>
of the firſt Ode of <hi>Pindar</hi> without Figures, has tranſlated it without Poetry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rapin</hi> is exactly of the ſame Mind in his Twenty Ninth Reflection upon Poetry in general. For having told us that <hi>Virgil</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

For the Figures generally ſupply us with Images greater than the Things themſelves. In ſhort, a Poet ought to be poſſeſſed of all that Art and that Method in which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence is deſign'd to inſtruct us with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Figures. They are the Figures that enable him to give Force to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Brightneſs to the Diction and to the Periods, Weight to his Arguments, and Charms to all that he ſays.

            <p>As for Simplicity, of which the <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> boaſts ſo much, the foreſaid <hi>Rapin</hi> has remarkably told us, in his Twenty Seventh Reflection, that the Simplicity of Thought and even Simplicity of Expreſſion in great Subjects is not incompatible with the greateſt Pomp and Magnificence. For Simplicity of Thought and Simplicity of Expreſſion is nothing but ſuch Thought and ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as Nature in ſuch and ſuch Caſes voluntarily ſuggeſts and dictates to us.</p>

la plus univerſelle.</q> Which moſt remarkable Paſſage is render'd thus.</p>
            <p>The Third Quality of the Diction is that it ought to be natural, without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Affectation, according to the Rules of Decorum and of good Senſe. Phraſes that appear too much ſtudied, a Style that is too florid, a Manner that is too nicely wrought, Things that are finely ſaid, Terms that are too far fetch'd, and all Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are windy and ſwell Uſe, are inſupportable to the true Poetry. Only Simplicity can agree with it, provided that Simplicity be ſuſtain'd by Nobility and by Greatneſs. But that is a Simplicity with which only great Souls are acquainted. 'Tis the Maſter-work of Poetry, and the Character of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> The Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant look for what they call Wit and fine Thoughts, becauſe they are ignorant. The fourth Quality of the Diction is, that it be exalted and ſonorous. For every thing that is vulgar in the Expreſſion is below it. It requires Words which have nothing that is baſe and common in them, a Diction that is noble and magnificent, Expreſſions that are ſtrong, and Colours that are lively, and daring and audacious Strokes. It requires, to ſay all, a Diſcourſe that is able to come up to the Greatneſs of that Workman's Ideas, who ought to be the Maker and Creator of his own Works. The fifth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0826500101:199"/>
Quality of the Diction is that it be harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, that it may maintain that great and majeſtick Air, with which Poetry is wont to adorn it ſelf, and may expreſs all the Force and the utmoſt Dignity of the great Things which it utters. It ought to reject all Terms but thoſe that are proper to fill the Mouth and content the Ear, that it may attain to that Sublime and that Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, which it always and every where aims at. But 'tis not ſufficient that there be Greatneſs and Magnificence in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, there ought to be likewiſe Ardor and Vehemence, and there ought eſpecially to reign throughout the Diſcourſe, a fine, a graceful, and a delicate Air, which ought to appear its principal Ornament, and its moſt univerſal Beauty.</p>
            <p>Now what one of theſe great Qualities has the old Ballad of <hi>Chevy Chaſe?</hi> Of all the Lines which the Captain has quoted, 'tis remarkable, that there is but one which has any thing like a Figure in it. Now tho' the Subject of that Song is noble, yet there being nothing figurative in it, 'tis plain by conſequence that there is nothing great, nothing noble in it; no Magnificence, no Vehemence, no Painting, no Poetry. To compare any of the Paſſages in it to <hi>Virgil</hi> is ridiculous, and a Man may as well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a dead Man to a living. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0826500101:200"/>
what manner of Compariſon is there between theſe two Paſſages.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Hounds ran ſwiftly thro' the Wood</l>
               <l>The nimble Deer to take,</l>
               <l>And with their Cries the Hills and Dales</l>
               <l>An Eccho ſhrill did make.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And that of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>—vocat ingenti clamore Cithaeron</l>

            </q>
            <p>What is there in the firſt but what is vile and trivial? What Ploughman, what Tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, what Trull is not capable of ſaying the like? But that of <hi>Virgil,</hi> where he gives Voice to the Mountains, and Voice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Soul to the Words, is ſo bold, ſo figurative, ſo pompous, ſo harmonious, that a Man muſt be <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf to ſay it. What can be more ridiculous, nay more monſtrous, than to find any thing reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the following abominable Dogrel,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Sir <hi>Charles Martell</hi> of <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> too,</l>
               <l>His Siſter's Son was he;</l>
               <l>Sir <hi>David Lamb</hi> ſo well eſteem'd,</l>
               <l>Yet ſaved could not be.</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0826500101:201"/>
And the following Verſes of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>—Cadit &amp; Ripheus, juſtiſſimus unus</l>

            <p>Where the divine Harmony is the Reſult of uncommon Paſſion, and productive of no vulgar Paſſion. Thus we ſee, that in ſpight of the pretended Reſemblance, the old Dogrel is contemptible, and <hi>Virgil</hi> is incomparable and inimitable. One might with a great deal more Juſtice pretend, that there is a Reſemblance between the 148th Pſalm of <hi>Sternhold,</hi> and that admirable Hymn of <hi>Milton</hi> in the Fifth Book of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe Loſt.</hi> And yet we need only tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them both, and place them together here, to convince the Reader, that the one is bald, and vile, and wretched, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great and exalted Poetry.

Thus have we laid before the Reader the contemptible Dogrel of <hi>Hopkins</hi>; a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is deſpicable Dogrel in ſpight of its being figurative. For every Line here is a different Apoſtrophe. But theſe are Figures which are another Perſon's, which the Tranſverſer repeats like a Parrot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding them, and without being mov'd by them, and which conſequently have neither Paſſion nor Sublimity to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain them. For 'tis a juſt Obſervation which is made by <hi>Longinus,</hi> that as the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures ſupport the pathetick and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, they are wonderfully ſupported by each of them. Let us now ſee how the Force of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Genius hides and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals the Aſſiſtance of Art, while theſe lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Figures, at the very time that they raiſe and tranſport his exalted Soul, are loſt in his Enthuſiaſm and his Sublimity, as the glittering of numberleſs Stars is ſwallow'd and loſt in the blaze of Day, and that gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Deluge of Light which on every ſide overwhelms them.

When a Man boaſts of his own moral Virtues, is a ſign for the moſt part that he is conſcious of the contrary Vices, and ſo has recourſe to bragging to blind the Eyes of thoſe with whom he converſes.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE among the reſt of the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I have to you, you have been ſo generous as to defend me from that Accuſation of Ill-nature, which has been brought againſt me by ſome who are ſo far from knowing me, that perhaps they never ſaw me; I am animated by ſo friendly a Proceeding to ſend you my Thoughts upon this ſubject, as they have from time to time come into my Mind, as well as I am able to recollect them, in that ill State of Health under which I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at preſent.</p>
            <p>As this Accuſation is brought againſt me by thoſe who are utter Strangers to me, it muſt proceed from the Books which I have publiſh'd, and particularly from the Books of Criticiſm. But if in my Criticiſm I am in the right, my very being ſo muſt be a ſufficient Apology a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0826500101:218"/>
that Accuſation. For he who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes a Man of Ill-nature for writing a juſt Criticiſm, knows not what is meant by either of the Terms, either by Ill-nature or Criticiſm. By Ill-nature muſt be meant ſomething that is contrary to the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, as by Good-nature muſt be underſtood ſomething that is agreeable to it, or the one can be no Term of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, nor the other of Commendation. But the true Nature of Man muſt conſiſt in Reaſon, which diſtinguiſhes him from all other Creatures, and therefore no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or Action that is reaſonable can poſſibly denominate him ill-natur'd.</p>
            <p>But as the true Nature of Man is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, it is likewiſe ſocial; and Man is therefore the moſt ſocial of Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the moſt reaſonable. Now a juſt Criticiſm is perfectly agreeable to the Nature of Man conſider'd as 'tis ſocial. For what does the good Critic deſign? he deſigns to detect and diſgrace Errour, to diſcloſe and honour Truth; he deſigns the Advancement of a noble Art, and by it the Intereſt and Glory of his Native Country, which depend in no ſmall meaſure upon the flouriſhing of Arts.</p>
            <p>If he has the greateſt Goodneſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who has the largeſt ſhare of ſocial Virtue; if he has the largeſt ſhare of ſocial Virtue, who labours moſt for the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0826500101:219"/>
of the Society in which he lives, and of all his Fellow-Creatures in general; if the Happineſs of ones Native Country, and of Humankind in general, depend more, under God, upon the Maintenance of Liberty, than upon any other thing whatſoever; who can juſtly pretend (not only of the Writers of the preſent Age, but of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers in general) to a greater Goodneſs of Nature than my ſelf, who have made it the conſtant Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Life to defend and maintain Liberty? Who has taken more delight in praiſing her Benefactor, or in branding and defaming her avowed and mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies? In ſhort, Sir, Liberty has been the continual Theme of my Pen, and the conſtant Employment of my Life. And have I taken all this Pains for my ſelf? No. I wanted not common Senſe to diſcern that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberties would be of longer continuance than my Life. But the growing Corruptions of my Countrymen gave me too juſt grounds to apprehend that Liberty in <hi>Great Britain</hi> would not laſt many Centuries. I therefore reſolv'd to caſt in my Mite towards the rendring it perpetual in this Iſland. And yet I knew very well and foreſaw, that by this very Endeavour to ſerve them, I ſhould draw upon me the Hatred of a great part of my Countrymen, and by conſequence a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0826500101:220"/>
thouſand different Slanders. They have given me diſtempers of Body, and defects of Mind, of which I have not the leaſt Knowledge; and the Opinion of my Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature has proceeded as much from my Endeavours to maintain and prolong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and by conſequence to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Happineſs to them and to their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as from my detecting and expoſing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Poetaſters. For which if I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for my ſelf, I am more ſorry for my Country, for a People ſo diſpos'd can be free no longer than their Rulers are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould be ſo. I am in ſo faint and languiſhing a Condition, that I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further, tho' I have many things to ſay. But I will certainly reſume this Subject, if I ever retrieve my Vigour.</p>

The Opinions of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in Things of this nature are variable and uncertain, and the Reputations of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are ſubject to ſtrange Reverſes.

            <p>I Was ſo very much tyr'd the laſt Poſt with ſending away ſeveral Letters, that I was incapable of writing any thing that could have been agreeable to you, tho' it had been never ſo ſhort. I am ſorry to hear of the Complaints you make of the Effects of the Spleen. I deſire you to pardon my plain-dealing, which proceeds purely from that Eſteem and Affection which I have always had for you ever ſince I had the Honour to know you; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I venture to tell you, that a Perſon of your Fortune and Underſtanding need not have the Spleen any longer than he pleaſes. The Spleen is nothing but the Effect of Stagnation, and the Motion of vigorous Exerciſe muſt and will cure it. Take a gentle trotting Horſe, and an honeſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant, and come up and ſee your old Friends and this wicked Town but for one
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0826500101:228"/>
Fortnight, and if the Journey to this Town and back again into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and the ſtrange Sights which you will ſee here, do not remove the Spleen for one ſix Months, I will be contented to have it for twelve. For you who have now been abſent twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, will find here a Town entirely new; new Buildings, new Men, new Manners; Avarice, and Luxury, and Profuſion joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Triple League, and Liberty, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Religion engag'd in a Battel Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. You will find here entirely new Setts of all Sorts of Men; new Players at Cheſs, who never could yet ſee two Removes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; new Whigs without one Dram of Publick Spirit; and new Wits and Poets without one Grain of Common Senſe. You will find a new Idol worſhip'd in the midſt of a Chriſtian Country, a baſe, dirty, contemptible Idol, worſhip'd by all that once was thought great and noble and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable. You will find his Temple in the midſt of that Country's Metropolis, a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as dirty and deſpicable as its Deity; a Temple without either Roof, or Door, or Desk, or Pew, or Altar, yet its pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prieſts as proud as they are baſe and ſordid; his Prieſts compos'd of inſolent Cits, and Pe<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

you will ſee his Worſhippers arrive in Crowds from Morning to the Evening, and mingled in his Temple in as monſtrous a manner as the Elements were in Chaos, where Fire with Water, Earth with Air were blended and confounded. As all theſe Sights will be new, I believe they will be very diverting; and what will be as new and as diverting as all the reſt, you will ſee in this Town old Friends with new Shapes and Faces.

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have lately had the Satisfaction to read over your Memoirs of Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> which I had laſt Week from Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and found the Relation very entertaining and the Reflections juſt and pathetick. If I give you Hints of ſome particular Paſſages which ſeem either to have ſlipt from your Memory, or to have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped your Knowledge, I flatter my ſelf that you will receive them kindly, ſince they are only ſent with Intention to give you an Opportunity, whenever you have a mind to retouch your Memoirs, to make them more compleat, tho' they cannot be more agreeable.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, to enter upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, without any more Ceremony. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0826500101:231"/>
could learn, either from Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> himſelf, or from Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> or Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sheer,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Walkeden,</hi> or from any of thoſe who had been longeſt acquainted with Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> that he had ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at either of our Univerſities. About the Age of Fifteen he was ſent for Education to the Weſtern Parts of <hi>France,</hi> either to <hi>Saintonge</hi> or the <hi>Angoumois.</hi> His Abode there was either upon the Banks of the <hi>Charante,</hi> or very little remov'd from it. And he had there the Happineſs to be in the Neighbourhood of one of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Ladies of the Court of <hi>France, Madame de Montauſier,</hi> whom <hi>Voiture</hi> has made famous by ſeveral very ingenious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the moſt of which were writ to her when ſhe was a Maid, and call'd <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Rambouillet.</hi> I have heard Mr. <hi>W<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> ſay, that he was often admitted to the Converſation of that Lady, who us'd to call him the Little <hi>Hugenot</hi>; and that young as he was, he was equally pleas'd with the Beauty of her Mind, and with the Graces of her Perſon.</p>
            <p>Upon the writing his firſt Play, which was <hi>St. James</hi>'s <hi>Park,</hi> he became acquainted with ſeveral of the moſt celebrated Wits both of the Court and Town. The writing of that Play was likewiſe the Occaſion of his becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with one of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Miſteſſes after a very particular manner.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0826500101:232"/>
As Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> was going thro' <hi>Pall-mall</hi> towards St. <hi>James</hi>'s in his Chariot, he met the foreſaid Lady in hers, who, thruſting half her Body out of the Chariot, cry'd out aloud to him, <hi>You,</hi> Wycherley, <hi>you are a Son of a Whore,</hi> at the ſame time laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud and heartily. Perhaps, Sir, if you never heard of this Paſſage before, you may be ſurpris'd at ſo ſtrange a Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one of the moſt beautiful and beſt bred Ladies in the World. Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> was certainly very much ſurpris'd at it, yet not ſo much but he ſoon apprehended it was ſpoke with Alluſion to the latter End of a Song in the foremention'd Play.</p>
            <q>
               <l>When Parents are Slaves</l>
               <l>Their Brats cannot be any other,</l>
               <l>Great Wits and great Braves</l>
               <l>Have always a Punk to their Mother.</l>
            </q>
            <p>As, during Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s Surpriſe, the Chariots drove different ways, they were ſoon at a conſiderable Diſtance from each other, when Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> recovering from his Surpriſe, ordered his Coachman to drive back, and to overtake the Lady. As ſoon as he got over-againſt her, he ſaid to her, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you have been pleaſed to beſtow a Title on me which generally belongs to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate. Will your Ladyſhip be at the Play to Night? Well,</hi> ſhe reply'd, <hi>what if I am</hi>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0826500101:233"/>
               <hi>there? Why then I will be there to wait on your Ladyſhip, tho' I diſappoint a very fine Woman who has made me an Aſſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>you are ſure to diſappoint a Woman who has favour'd you for one who has not. Yes,</hi> he reply'd, <hi>if ſhe who has not favour'd me is the finer Woman of the two. But he who will be conſtant to your Ladyſhip, till he can find a finer Woman, is ſure to die your Captive.</hi> The Lady bluſh'd, and bade her Coachman drive away. As ſhe was then in all her Bloom, and the moſt celebrated Beauty that was then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or perhaps that has been in <hi>England</hi> ſince, ſhe was touch'd with the Gallantry of that Compliment. In ſhort, ſhe was that Night in the firſt Row of the King's Box in <hi>Drury Lane,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> in the Pit under her, where he entertained her during the whole Play. And this, Sir, was the beginning of a Correſpondence between theſe two Perſons, which afterwards made a great Noiſe in the Town.</p>
            <p>But now, Sir, I ſhall proceed to remind you of ſomething more extraordinary, and that is, that the Correſpondence between Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> and the foreſaid Lady was the Occaſion of bringing Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour with <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who was paſſionately in Love with that Lady, who was ill treated by her, and who believed Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> his happy Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0826500101:234"/>
After the Duke had long ſollicited her without obtaining any thing, whether the Relation between them ſhock'd her, for ſhe was his Couſin-Germain, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe apprehended that an Intrigue with a Perſon of his Rank and Character, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon whom the Eyes of all Men were fix'd, muſt of Neceſſity in a little time come to the King's Ears, whatever was the Cauſe, ſhe refus'd to admit of his Viſits ſo long, that at laſt Indignation, Rage and Diſdain took Place of his Love, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ruin her. When he had taken this Reſolution, he had her ſo narrowly watch'd by his Spies, that he ſoon came to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe whom he had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Rivals. And after he knew them, he never fail'd to name them aloud, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to expoſe the Lady, to all thoſe who frequented him, and among others he us'd to name Mr. <hi>Wycherley.</hi> As ſoon as it came to the Knowledge of the latter, who had all his Expectations from the Court, he apprehended the Conſequence of ſuch a Report, if it ſhould reach the King. He applied himſelf therefore to <hi>Wilmot</hi> Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and to Sir <hi>Charles Sedley,</hi> and entreated them to remonſtrate to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> the Miſchief which he was about to do to one who had not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be known to him, and who had never offended him. Upon their opening
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0826500101:235"/>
the Matter to the Duke, he cry'd out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, <hi>that he did not blame</hi> Wycherley, <hi>he only accus'd his Couſin. Ay, but,</hi> they reply'd, <hi>by rendring him ſuſpected of ſuch an Intrigue, you are about to ruine him, that is, your Grace is about to ruine a Man with whoſe Converſation you would be pleas'd above all things.</hi> Upon this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſaid ſo much of the ſhining Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> and of the Charms of his Converſation, that the Duke, who was as much in love with Wit, as he was with his Kinſwoman, was impatient till he was brought to ſup with him, which was in two or three Nights. After Supper Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> who was then in the Height of his Vigor both of Body and Mind, thought himſelf oblig'd to exert himſelf, and the Duke was charm'd to that degree, that he cry'd out in a Tranſport, <hi>By G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap> my Couſin is in the right of it</hi>; and from that very Moment made a Friend of a Man whom he believ'd his happy Rival.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> gave him ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid ſenſible Proofs of his Eſteem and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For as he was at the ſame time Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Horſe to King <hi>Charles,</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of a Regiment; as Maſter of the Horſe he made him one of his Equeries, and as Colonel of a Regiment he made him Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lieutenant of his own Company, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to him at the ſame time his own
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0826500101:236"/>
Pay as Captain, and all other Advantages that could be juſtly made of the Company I remember that about that time I, who was come up from the Univerſity to ſee my Friends in Town, happen'd to be one Night at the Fountain Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> with the late Dr. <hi>Duke, David Loggen</hi> the Painter, and Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> of whom <hi>Otway</hi> has made honourable Mention in <hi>Tonſon</hi>'s firſt Miſcellany, and that after Supper we drank Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s Health by the Name of Captain <hi>Wycherley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was not long after this in ſuch high Favour with the King, that that Monarch gave him a Proof of his Eſteem and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which never any Sovereign Prince before had given to an Author who was only a private Gentleman. Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> happen'd to fall ſick of a Feaver at his Lodgings in <hi>Bow-ſtreet, Covent Garden,</hi> during which Sickneſs the King did him the Honour to viſit him, when finding his Feaver indeed abated, but his Body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely weaken'd, and his Spirits miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſhatter'd, he commanded him, as ſoon as he was able to take a Journey, to go to the South of <hi>France,</hi> believing that nothing would contribute more to the reſtoring his former Vigour, than the gentle ſalutiferous Air of <hi>Montpelier</hi> during the Winter Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. At the ſame time the King was pleas'd to aſſure him, <hi>that as ſoon as he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0826500101:237"/>
               <hi>of taking that Journey, he would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der five hundred Pounds to be paid him to defray the Expence of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> accordingly went into <hi>France</hi> in the beginning of the Winter of 1678, if I am not miſtaken, and returned into <hi>England</hi> in the latter end of the Spring of 1679, entirely reſtor'd to his former Vigor both of Body and Mind. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him with the utmoſt Marks of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and ſhortly after his Arrival told him that he had a Son, who he was reſolv'd ſhould be educated like the Son of a King, and that he could make Choice of no Man ſo proper to be his Governor as Mr. <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherley</hi>; that for that Service he ſhould have fifteen hundred Pounds a Year paid him, for the Payment of which he ſhould have an Aſſignment upon three ſeveral Offices, whoſe Names I have forgot, to which the King added, <hi>that when the Time came that his Office was to ceaſe, he would take care to make ſuch a Proviſion for him as ſhould ſet him above the Malice of the World and Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Sir, is it not matter of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that one of Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Merit, who was eſteem'd by all the moſt deſerving Perſons of the Court of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and in high Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the King himſelf, ſhould in a little time, after he had received theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

Offers which ſeem to have made and to have fix'd his Fortune, be thrown into Priſon for bare ſeven hundred Pounds, and be ſuffer'd to languiſh there during the laſt four Years of that Monarch's Reign; forſaken by all his Friends at Court and quite aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by the King? 'Tis no eaſie matter, Sir, to find a more extraordinary Inſtance of the Viciſſitude of Human Affairs, and if the Cauſe of ſo ſtrange an Alteration is unknown to you, I dare promiſe my ſelf that you are very deſirous to hear it.</p>
            <p>It was immediately after Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> had received theſe gracious Offers from the King, that the Water-drinking Seaſon coming on, he went down to <hi>Tunbridge</hi> to take either the Benefit of the Waters or the Diverſions of the Place, when walking one Day upon the Wells Walk with his Friend Mr. <hi>Fairbeard</hi> of <hi>Grey's-Inn,</hi> juſt as he came up to the Bookſeller's, my Lady <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda,</hi> a young Widow, rich, noble, and beautiful, came to the Bookſeller and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd for <hi>the Plain Dealer. Madam,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Fairbeard, ſince you are for the</hi> Plain Dealer, <hi>there he is for you,</hi> puſhing Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> towards her. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherley, this Lady can bear plain Dealing, for ſhe appears to be ſo accompliſh'd, that what would be Compliment ſaid to others, ſpoke to her would be plain Dealing. No, truly, Sir,</hi> ſaid the Lady, <hi>I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0826500101:239"/>
               <hi>my Faults any more than the reſt of my Sex, and yet notwithſtanding all my Faults, I love plain Dealing, and never am more fond of it than when it tells me of my Faults. Then, Madam,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Fairbeard, you and the</hi> Plain Dealer <hi>ſeem deſign'd by Heaven for each other.</hi> In ſhort, Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> walk'd with her upon the Walks, waited upon her home, viſited her daily at her Lodgings, while ſhe ſtaid at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and after ſhe went to <hi>London,</hi> at her Lodgings in <hi>Hatton Garden,</hi> where in a little time he got her Conſent to marry her, which he did, by his Father's Command, without acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King; for it was reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that the Lady having a great Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Eſtate, and noble and powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, the acquainting the King with the intended Marriage might be the likelieſt way to prevent it. As ſoon as the News of it came to Court it was look'd upon as an Affront to the King, and a Contempt of his Majeſty's Offers. And Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s Conduct after his Marriage made this be reſented more heinouſly. For ſeldom or never coming near the Court, he was thought downright ungrateful. But the true Cauſe of his Abſence was not known, and the Court was at that time too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd, and in too much Diſquiet to enquire into it. In ſhort, Sir, the Lady was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of him to Diſtraction, jealous to that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0826500101:240"/>
degree, that ſhe could not endure that he ſhould be one Moment out of her Sight. Their Lodgings were in <hi>Bow-ſtreet, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden,</hi> over-againſt the <hi>Cock,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if he at any time went with his Friends, he was oblig'd to leave the Windows o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that the Lady might ſee there was no Woman in Company, or ſhe would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in a downright raving Condition. Whether this outragious Jealouſy proceeded from the exceſs of her Paſſion, for ſhe lov'd her Husband with the ſame Violence with which ſhe had done her Lover, or from the great Things which ſhe had heard reported of his manly Proweſs, which were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd by her Experience, or from them both together, Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> thought that he was oblig'd to humour it, and that he could not be too indulgent to a Lady who had beſtow'd both her Perſon and her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune on him. This, Sir, was the Cauſe that brought Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> all at once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the utmoſt Diſgrace with the Court, whoſe Favour and Affection but juſt before he poſſeſſed in the higheſt Degree. And theſe, Sir, are the Particulars of Mr. <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherley</hi>'s Life, which ſeem either to have ſlipt from your Memory, or to have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped your Knowledge.</p>
