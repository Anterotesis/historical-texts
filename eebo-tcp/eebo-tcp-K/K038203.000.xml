            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Obſervations and Complaints of the ill State and Male-Practice of Phyſick in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> were at firſt intended to appear in another Dreſs; and by way of Appeal to our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations, where that noble and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Art is ſaid to be exerciſed in a more regular and beneficial manner. For By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders, who are not heated by Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and perſonal Reflections, who are not intereſted in a Debate, and have no Party-Quarrel to maintain, are the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Perſons to examine and determine the Reaſonableneſs of the Cauſe; and as their Paſſions are calmer and more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſo their Deciſions are likely to be more juſt and equal, and agreeable to Truth, than the Sentiments of thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are more nearly concerned. But when I conſidered, that all national
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0953800700:5"/>Grievances, (and certainly the Abuſe of this excellent Faculty is a very great <hi>one!</hi>) ought rather to be corrected at home, than expoſed abroad; that the Miſmanagement and Diſhoneſty of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> ſhou'd not procure the Condemnation of <hi>all;</hi> and Offenders only ſhou'd ſuffer; and that they too could not be <hi>legally</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and puniſhed, but by the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative Powers; I had Thoughts of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing them to a Worthy Patriot, who might, in Parliament, have procured a Redreſs of as many of them at leaſt, as the Wiſdom of the Nation might think worth their Cognizance. Yet conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how far that Auguſt Aſſembly is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs'd and engaged in the more ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and difficult Affairs of the Nation, and likewiſe the Temper and Taſte of my intended Patron; the one ſo exquiſite and diſtinguiſhing, that ſcarce a Word could drop from the Pen without the Terror of Reprehenſion; and the other ſo moderated, that had I attempted to make way for a favourable Reception by (the common Method in Dedications) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing but few of his real Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it wou'd ſcarce have been looked upon as a juſt Encomium. I reſolved at length therefore to adventure into a cenſorious World theſe rude Papers, containing little elſe but Matters of Fact as naked Truths, without any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrage
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0953800700:6"/>or Defence; and think, theſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſenting, the giving my Reaſons for making no Dedication, is Dedication enough. For in all Diſquiſitions about Truth, 'tis not the Greatneſs, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Weight of the Advocate, but of his Arguments and Proofs, that is the Point to be minded; and the more plain and unadorned his Diſcourſe is, the greater Air of Veracity it hath. For which reaſon I ſhall no more be at the pains to make any Apology for the looſe Compoſition and careleſs Diction of this Pamphlet, than I ſhall think my ſelf obliged to anſwer the unreaſonable Cavils, and loud Clamours that may be raiſed by ſelf-intereſted and diſhoneſt Men againſt it:<note place="margin">Reaſons of this Work. 1ſt.</note> Thinking that I ſhall have ſufficiently diſcharged my <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> in detecting their Diſhoneſty; and that it is not in their Power to ſay much in their own Vindication, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing more of their own Diſingenuity and Baſeneſs, to the Judicious eſpecially, and diſcerning Part of Mankind. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I think it any Reflection, that others have offered the ſame Things in a better manner; but rather as a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what I ſay; that makes what I here deliver, appear with the greater Force of Evidence.</p>
            <p>Though it muſt be acknowledged, that Matters go not ſo well with the World,
<pb n="vj" facs="tcp:0953800700:7"/>as that moſt Voices ſhou'd be on the beſt Side; and ſuch Perſons as are Slaves to their Luſts, indolent, ignorant and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, take up with the Opinions and Ways in faſhion without much Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and thus are eaſily led on to their own Diſadvantage, and ſometimes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by Men of corrupt Minds, whoſe ſole Advantage lies in Cheat and Impoſition, and who, of conſequence, have alſo a burning Hatred to plain, open, and fair Dealing, and to the Truth: and from whom her ſtricteſt Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers muſt expect to meet with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage. The Truths even of the Holy Goſpel have generally been on the ſuffering Side. And when I ſee thoſe, promulged for the Salvation of Souls, have met with ſuch bad Treatment, how can I expect that theſe, of leſs Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, calculated only for the Safety of the Body, ſhou'd find a more gracious Reception?</p>
            <p>But if I am guilty of any Breach of good Manners, in meddling with other Mens Morals, Means of living, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, I am ſorry for it. And if in my Enquiries I have been any way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, and led into Miſtakes; or have been too impertinent and tedious, too clamorous and ſevere, I humbly beg pardon, and ſubmit to the Correction of my legal Superiors, aſſuring them,
<pb n="vij" facs="tcp:0953800700:8"/>that I ſpeak no Falſhoods, to the beſt of my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Knowledge; and as I had no Pleaſure in finding out, ſo I have no Profit in publiſhing the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſorders; which indeed have,<note place="margin">2d.</note> of long time, been no Secrets to Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſuffering People, who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto complained in vain, and groan under unſufferable Oppreſſions that they wou'd gladly get rid of, if they knew where or how they could be relieved, and which have been diſcovered by many worthy Phyſicians.<note place="margin">3d.</note> But then they have touched theſe Sores too tenderly; either fearing too much the Reſentment of thoſe People, who would not have them healed; or, finding it a Difficulty to ſet Men <hi>right,</hi> who go <hi>wrong</hi> out of Choice and Intereſt, ſurmounting all their Endeavours; and that I have no Ends in giving myſelf and others this Trouble, but what are juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and deſigned ſincerely for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good and Welfare of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And as true Honeſty, that is,<note place="margin">4th.</note> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of Heart and Life, is the firſt, the chief, and fundamental Point of true Wiſdom; ſo it is likewiſe, when apply'd to our Occupations and Profeſſions, Trade and Commerce; the only ſure Baſis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the moſt preferable thing, and to be regarded above Gain. On the contrary; As all unaccountable Ways of Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
<pb n="viij" facs="tcp:0953800700:9"/>all Extortion and unreaſonable Profit, are certainly diſhoneſt; ſo more eſpecially when the Life and Health, as well as the Eſtate of our Neighbour is endanger'd thereby, they become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, and ought to be condemned and rejected as intolerable. And, as ſaith a grave and learned<note n="*" place="bottom">Et ſi ad honeſtatem nati ſumus, ea aut ſola expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenda eſt, aut certe omni pondere gravior eſt haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. <hi>Tull.</hi>
               </note> Author, <q>"There are juſt Reaſons, why Men that are notorious for any Vice or Crime ſhou'd be expoſed and repreſented as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, not only to prevent others from falling into their Hands, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their Wickedneſs; but that they may undergo that Shame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, which ever muſt be the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ill Men".</q>
            </p>
            <p>To pretend to put a ſtop to male Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in Phyſick, is a bold <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking: and notwithſtanding it may, for theſe Reaſons, appear very neceſſary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to ſome; yet as it may be thought by a prevailing Majority, to proceed rather from Spite or Diſguſt than Diſcretion, it may chance to ruin him that will he ſo hardy as to attempt it.</p>
            <p>But ſince I am induced to lay open the Faults and Frauds of it,<note place="margin">5th.</note> for the ſake of
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0953800700:10"/>Juſtice and Charity itſelf; let the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent be what it will, I reſolve to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in this honeſt Diſquiſition, tho' I gain nothing thereby, but that Peace of Mind, that proceeds neceſſarily from the Reflection that I have done my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The moſt innocent, as well as the moſt ſerviceable and beſt Parts of a Man's Life, are frequently miſunderſtood, and highly cenſured. Yet, becauſe I know my Intentions are founded upon a good Bottom, I may ſtill hope that they will diſcover themſelves, and be juſtified by all in the Concluſion: Being ſatisfied that what I ſhall deliver hath Truth on its Side, (ſo far as I am able to come at the Knowledge thereof) which is the beſt Patron; and under that Protection I leave it.</p>

And ſo they go on till they loſe themſelves, their Senſes, all ocular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, and can find nothing but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Works of an Omnipotent Creator. Yet, I ſay, it is in the firſt place neceſſary, that the Student in Phyſick make himſelf very well verſed in natural Philoſophy; for it is generally remarked, <hi>Ubi definit Philoſophus, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit Medicus;</hi> and he that will undertake the Art of Healing, muſt underſtand not only the general, but alſo the particular Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0953800700:22"/>not only the ſound Frame of an human Body, but the Diſeaſes thereof, and thoſe Remedies that are indicated from the Cauſes and Symptoms of them. Hence we infer, that he muſt underſtand Anatomy, which ſhews him the Figure, Poſition, and Uſe of every Part of our Bodies, as they are in their natural State of Health. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pathology and Aetiology, which treat of the Difference, Cauſes and Symptoms of all Diſeaſes. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Phyſiology, or the Knowledge of ſimple Medicines, that are ſupply'd to us by Nature; and this alſo ſheweth the Strength and Virtue of each Medicament.

                  </note>AND this leads me, in the next place, to take notice of ſome Diſcouragements to young Gentlemen to enter upon this Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in <hi>Oxford</hi> eſpecially. In that they are obliged to take the Degrees of Batchelor and Maſter of Arts, before they can there be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the Phyſick Line; and muſt then take the Degree of Batchelor of Phyſick (and that after ten Years Reſidence) before they can be qualified regularly to hear the publick Profeſſor; which too they muſt do for full four Years longer, and be alſo full fourteen Years ſtanding before they can commence Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. This tedious Continuance in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, as well as the Exerciſes for thoſe four Degrees, can't but be attended with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Charge and Trouble. But whilſt they ſee, in the mean time, their Brethren at <hi>Cambridge</hi> take their Degree of Batchelor of Phyſick at ſeven Years ſtanding; and after that, not be obliged to Reſidence; and at ten Years ſtanding put on their Doctor's Gown: tho' their Time ſpent in the Univerſity is no longer than that required for the Degree of a Batchelor of Phyſick in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0953800700:25"/>Teſts of Probation no more expenſive nor difficult than his.<note place="margin">The Degree of Batchelor of Phyſick in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to that of Doctor in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                  </note> The Preference indeed is rather his Due upon theſe Accounts, when it is conſidered that he takes three Degrees, performs the Exerciſes required thereto, and is conſequently at a far greater Expence of Money, and the ſame of Time, as they are at for their Completion, or taking their Doctors Degree: To which if the <hi>Oxford</hi> Gentlemen proceed, as they take more Degrees, ſo are they in proportion at far greater Charges. And what is far more aggravating, when they ſee People, that are bred in private Academies, (and thence removed to <hi>Padua, Leyden,</hi> or <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht,</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> or <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> where in leſs than four or five Years Space they ſhall be <hi>dubb'd</hi> Doctors) intrude themſelves into Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Reſort and Practice, and by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking, major Part of Mankind be careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and preferred before our home-bred Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, merely for their Pretences to more Skill acquired by a foreign,<note place="margin">Regular and home-bred Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians poſtpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> though a much cheaper and ſhorter Way of Education: They cannot, I ſay, help being affected with ſome Uneaſineſs and Diſguſt, to ſee themſelves thus injuſtly obviated in their Pretences, and poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned.</p>
               <p>And as theUniverſities of other Nations are to be blamed for crowding in upon us ſuch Cluſters of mere Novices, (or rather our Laws for ſuffering them ſo to do;) ſo are our own for not better regulating their Methods of Study, and not making the Degrees of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick leſs expenſive. It might be more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for the <hi>Oxford</hi> Students in this Art, if for the two firſt Years they apply'd themſelves to the Study of Logick, moral Philoſophy, Politicks, <hi>aliiſque humanioribus literis,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0953800700:26"/>and for five more they ſhould not only hear the publick Lectures, but the Profeſſor ſhould direct the Courſe of their Studies; and by taking them with him into the ſick Chambers, ſhould inform them how to apply the Theory in their Practice; and not ſuffer the young Men to go on in their own injudicious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods before they commence Batchelors of Phyſick: Which ſhould be at ſeven Years ſtanding; and after that time ſo ſtrict a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence ſhould not be inſiſted on: and at ten Years ſtanding they might aſſume the Scarlet, having firſt performed all the Exerciſes for the ſeveral previous Degrees, as by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes are now required, as well as for that; and being ſtrictly examined, as to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience and Knowledge in all the ſeveral afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned neceſſary Qualifications.</p>
               <p>But our publick Profeſſors (whether thro' Negligence or Want of ſufficient Salaries to encourage them) ſeem very indifferent how the publick Exerciſes are performed; and give themſelves no trouble in directing the Students, either in a regular and expeditious Method of Study, or in the uſual way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Medicines, and the Rules of Practice. Or, if this were too much for our Profeſſors to undertake, a Catalogue of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors they might readily exhibit; and, out of Conſcience, ſcrutiny and examine more narrowly into the Abilities of thoſe they preſent to their Degrees in this Faculty: Or, ſurely there ſeems great need of ſome other able Men, who ſhould be appointed to try and judge who are fit to preſcribe and adminiſter Phyſick, before they are raſhly admitted to Practice.</p>

                  <hi>per</hi> Ounce, nay, (to come as near as may be to the Point) they buy it at half

               <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in his Art of Diſtilling tells us, They will make 20 Gallons of Plague Water, at 2 <hi>l.</hi> 9 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> prime Coſt: and they ſell it out again wholeſale at 8 <hi>l.</hi> that is, at 8 <hi>s.</hi>

The College Diſpenſatory, I ſay, is an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking worthy of imitation by thoſe Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that reſide in poor and populous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and are any way able to beat the Charge, and willing to be at the Trouble of erecting a Diſpenſatory, or keeping a Cloſet of choice Medicines in their own Houſes. And it wou'd be a great Encouragement to the Faculty, if in or near every Market Town, there were a Phyſician appointed, at a certain Salary (to be raiſed by a Pariſh Rate or Levy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to attend the Poor that ſhall be ſick: who ſhou'd be brought and placed in Infirmaries provided in every Pariſh, (or 2 or 3 Pariſhes might join their Stocks) for that End and Purpoſe. This wou'd be no more (I dare adventure to affirm, much leſs) Charge to the ſeveral Pariſhes, than they are now at, in paying ignorant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Phyſick for their attendance upon them, and their bad Medicines: and in Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Widows and Children of thoſe unfortunate poor Men, that have fallen into bad Hands, and whoſe Lives might have been preſerved, had an honeſt and skilful Phyſician been apply'd to. Moreover, as one remarks, The ſooner Diſeaſes are taken notice of (thoſe that are Epidemical eſpecially: and theſe begin
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0953800700:46"/>generally and make their firſt advances amongſt the pooreſt ſort of People,) by accurate and expert Phyſicians, the leſs Footing they will have, the Cure of them will be the eaſier, and their Advice will be rendered the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Which being uſurped by theſe injudicious Pretenders, the Diſtempers being miſtaken, or mal-treated, become Malignant, Contagious and Fatal.

               <p>Hence it is that ſo many of our regular Phyſicians have refuſed to come into the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.

               </p>
               <p>What can be the Reaſon of this? Either the Power of the College is Defective, or not rightly exerted; or, there is a great Neglect of the Statutes, that are as Wiſe and Moral as any extant, in any Society. It is certain there appears among the Members a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion (ariſing manifeſtly from their adhering to the Methods pleaſing the Apothecaries,<note place="margin">Vid. §. 4, 8, 10, 12.</note> or to the Diſpenſatory) and this produceth Parties and Partiality, a narrowneſs and ſelf-Intereſt, and a want of concern for the Honour and Benefit of the Community, and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in general. Inſtead of this, there are Combinations with private Views, to promote particular Advantages: ſome are applauded, and others ſupplanted, according as they reject or come into particular Meaſures. In ſhort, amongſt our Phyſicians, a diſregard of the true End of their Inſtitution, <hi>viz.</hi> The Good and Health of the People, ſeems but too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as well as great want of Candor one towards another.<note place="margin">Phyſick is a precarious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> To whom I would only add this one Conſideration, that, as the Laws have not provided for the Support of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Phyſick, as they have for thoſe of other Profeſſions, by Donations and lucrative Preferments, and their Emoluments are <hi>preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;</hi> they are not upon a national Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are to ſubſiſt wholly by their Skill, their Induſtry, and their Reputation, and good will of the People: It highly behoves them not only to encourage the Improvement of Knowledge, but likewiſe to be tender and cautious of bringing their Faculty into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: and I muſt aſſure them, that it is very
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0953800700:56"/>apparent, that whilſt they purſue every one his private Gain, and as Practice is now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, the Poor are utterly neglected, and the Rich intolerably abuſed:<note place="margin">The Poor are neglected, and the Rich abuſed.</note> and neither find any true Remedy, but from the Charitable and Candid (tho' much diſcouraged) Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Diſpenſatory.

For if the College can maintain the Power they claim over the Faculty in this manner (and I may ſay too, if the Privileges thereof are thus invaded in every corner of the Nation) our Univerſities are rendered uſeleſs with regard to the Art of Phyſick, if they cannot effectually Authorize their graduate Phyſicians.</p>

               <p>I need not here again recite, that the right and judicious Underſtanding of the Animal Oeconomy, a long and regular Courſe of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Application, together with abundance of judicious Inſtructions, and Expence of Money as well as Time; and after all, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience too to apply all the acquired Faculties and Science of Phyſick aright, is neceſſary to the Accompliſhment of a Phyſician. That the Indications curative are to be taken from the Aetiology of Diſeaſes, and the Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cauſes of Diſtempers (ſo far as it may be ſaid to be demonſtrative) from Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0953800700:65"/>his Bill, than for the Benefit of the Patient. (I cant avoid the Impertinence of Repetition frequently upon this provoking Occaſion.) Nay, and rather than not force a Trade, he will omit the moſt pertinent Ingredient in the Phyſicians Bill, and ſubſtitute another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Fancy, or Intereſt,<note place="margin">Apothecaries make up Bills unfaithfully. <hi>Vid. §. 1.</hi>

               <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that the Tribe of accurate Formaliſts are careſſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, becauſe they cant well avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with them in all their vile Practices, and horrid Impoſitions upon the Patient. They preſcribe plentifully, and cant well do otherwiſe, if they follow the Variety of Forms their Authors direct them to; as if the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity rather than the Matter of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine made it effectual: Neither can they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Adulteration or Badneſs of their Medicines, having no true Knowledge of them. (Indeed it is difficult to diſcover Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines when mixed throughly, but by their miſſing in their uſual Effects.) Nor dare they correct their extravagant Bills given in to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0953800700:66"/>their Patients; for then they muſt loſe their Credit with them, and ſhall be <hi>outed</hi> as faſt as they were introduced into any Family. For it ſo falls out generally upon any Indiſpoſition, that the Apothecaries are firſt applyd to; and if it proceeds ſo far that they cannot remedy it, but rather render it dangerous, then they are conſulted what Phyſician ſhall be made uſe of: and to be ſure an <hi>honeſt one,</hi> who dares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry and diſcountenance theſe their Abuſes, ſhall be poſtponed to theſe intruding Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; or, (I am aſhamed to ſpeak it) to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regular Phyſician, that will act ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, as to diſparage the Faculty by theſe baſe Compliances, (who, and all the other Tribe, are but as mere Stalking-Horſes to their Friends the ſordid Apothecaries, galloping from one Extremity of a County to another to skreen their abuſive Practices; and that in extreme Caſes only!) Or if they cant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant him, (the conſcientious Phyſician) by Lies and crafty Inſinuations, (as hath been more than once remarked) they will effect it, let him watch them as narrowly as he can, by making up his Preſcriptions falſe; by ſome <hi>Succedaneum,</hi> or corrupt Drug or other, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them ineffectual.</p>

               <p>Thus it comes to paſs, that theſe Pretenders are buoyed up; and the far greateſt Numbers of the Sick (not only in the Country, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in <hi>London</hi>) are committed to the Care of ignorant, audacious, diſqualified, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Intruders into the Practice of Phyſick. And thus it becomes ſcarce poſſible for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, regular Phyſician to do any good to his Patients, or to himſelf, and to retrieve the Honour of the Profeſſion, tho he endeavour it by all the engaging Methods that can be thought on. How ſhall a conſcientious, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, undeſigning Man, who cannot comply with theſe unfair Dealings, theſe wicked and dangerous Practices, and who hath nothing to depend upon (after he hath expended his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Education in one of our Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) but his Profeſſion,<note place="margin">§. 4, 12.</note> and the Candor, I might rather ſay the Perverſeneſs of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde and degenerate Generation, <hi>live</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them!
