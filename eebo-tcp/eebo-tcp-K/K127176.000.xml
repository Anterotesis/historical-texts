            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DESCRIPTION OF THE ROAD FROM LONDON TO BATH AND BRISTOL.</head>
            <p>THE Bath road is meaſured from Hyde Park corner. On the right as we leave London, is Hyde Park, a park belonging to the crown; it is much frequented by thoſe who wiſh to take the air, either on foot, on horſeback, or in carriages. In fine weather, it is generally crowded from two o'clock in the afternoon till five.</p>
            <p>The firſt village that occurs, as ſoon as we are through the turnpike-gate, is Knightſbridge. On entering this place, oppoſite the Park wall, ſtands St. George's Hoſpital, an endowment for ſick and lame. A little beyond this, the road falls off on the left to Chelſea and Fulham-bridge.</p>
            <p>About half a mile from the gate, on the right, going out of Knightſbridge, is a new building, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the Park wall, built as barracks for the ſoldiery.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1288701200:3"/>About two miles from town, is the village of Kenſington; on the right as you enter it, is one of the King's palaces; the gardens to which are laid out in lawn and ſhrubbery, and kept in good order, and are open certain hours of the day for people to walk in.</p>
            <p>This ſpot was formerly the ſeat of the Veres, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors of the Earls of Oxford, to whom it was given by William the Conqueror: it afterwards fell into the poſſeſſion of Lord Chancellor Finch, Earl of Nottingham; and was from him purchaſed by William III. who built the palace. It has been the temporary reſidence of ſucceſſive Kings and Queens of England, from William III. to George II. who died there.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Going out of Kenſington on the right, on an eminence ſtands Camden Houſe, once a noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, now a boarding ſchool for young ladies.</p>
            <p>The next houſe on the right, whoſe grounds ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join Camden Houſe; and near the turnpike, is a ſtately Gothic ſtructure, on the ſummit of a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lawn, called Holland Houſe; belonging to the Earl of Holland, and built by an anceſtor, in the reign of Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Near the three mile ſtone we enter Hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, a long and ſtraggling village, in which lives, a little to the left, near the church, the Margrave of Anſpach.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1288701200:4"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A little beyond the four mile ſtone is Turnham green; on the entrance to this place the road turns off on the left to Chiſwick; a pleaſant village, within a mile, on the banks of the Thames: near which is a ſmall houſe, built in the ſtile of an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian villa, by the late Lord Burlington, now the property of the Duke of Devonſhire.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
            </p>
            <p>On the right, at about half a mile diſtant, but in view, is a houſe, called Gunnerſbury Houſe, built by Mr. Webb, ſon-in-law to Inigo Jones; it was the property and reſidence of the late Princeſs Amelia, aunt to the preſent King.</p>
            <p>A little beyond this, on the left, ſtands Kew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, croſſing the Thames, and leading to Kew, Richmond, &amp;c. in the county of Surrey. The road from London here, as far Colnbrooke, is in the county of Middleſex.</p>
            <p>We now enter the old town of Brentford, which, with the new town in continuance, is more than a mile in length. This town is poor, dirty, and ſtraggling; it ſtands on the banks of the Thames; on the oppoſite ſhore of which, are the beautiful and royal gardens of Kew and Richmond, The ſeven mile ſtone ſtands at the corner of a ſtreet, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> leading into the road to Ealing and Uxbridge.</p>
            <p>Brentford is a market town, and the county town, where the members for the county are choſen, on a building erected for the purpoſe, behind the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket houſe. Deſpicable as this town appears, it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1288701200:5"/>carries on a good trade with the metropolis, by means of the river, in corn, malt, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
            <p>In 1612, Charles I. beat his enemies at this place; and the Earl of Forth, commander of the Kings forces, was created Earl of Brentford, which title became extinct at his death, in 1651.</p>
            <p>Paſſing the bridge, as we leave the town on the right, is the navigable canal from Uxbridge, &amp;c. that enters the Thames hard by.</p>
            <p>A little beyond Brentford on the left, is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnade or gates entering the ſeat of the Duke of Northumberland, called Sion Houſe, from a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery founded here, in 1414, by Henry V. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VI. gave it to his uncle, the Protector, in 1547, who began to build this magnificent ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the walls of which now remain. After the attainder and execution of this nobleman, it was confiſcated, and afterwards given to the Duke of Northumberland, and on his execution, in 1553, it reverted to the Crown: James II. gave it to the Earl of Northumberland and his heirs for ever. The houſe is a quadrangle, of white ſtone, ſeated on the banks of the Thames.</p>
            <p>Scarce do we paſs this place, but we reach the grounds of an elegant villa, on the right, called Sion Hill, belonging to the Duke of Marlborough.</p>
            <p>The road on the left, through a turnpike-gate, leads to Iſleworth, Twickenham, and Hampton Court, diſtance about four or five miles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1288701200:6"/>Paſſing the eight mile ſtone we come to Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Green turnpike; on the left of which, before we reach it, bounded by a brick-wall, ſtands, or ſtood, Kendal Houſe, once the reſidence of the Dutcheſs of Kendal, a favourite of George II. and afterwards converted into a public houſe.</p>
            <p>From Smallborough Green we enter Hounſlow; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> at the further end of which village, the two great weſtern roads fork off; that on the right, to Bath; that on the left, to Exeter and Cornwall. There is a very good road to Bath through Andover, or the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter road, not more than one or two miles out of the way, which is fully compenſated by avoiding the hills, between Marlborough and Devizes, and the high charges at the different inns, on what is called the Bath road, which is the road moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.</p>
            <p>Juſt beyond the 10 mile ſtone, on the left, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the new barracks for the ſoldiers. Hounſlow Heath is a dead flat, of great extent, and, having no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, we have as little to ſay reſpecting it.</p>
            <p>Twelve miles and a half from London, a rivulet, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11, 12."/> called the Crane, croſſes the road, and north of it lies the village of Cranford, where there is a park at a little diſtance, abounding with wood and water, the ſeat of the Earl of Berkeley.</p>
            <p>The road beyond Cranford-bridge, is ſtill a level; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> on the right lies the Pariſh of Harlington, and near
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1288701200:7"/>it, Dawley; formerly in the poſſeſſion of the Lords Bolingbroke and Tankerville, now the property of Edmond Stephenſon, Eſq.</p>
            <p>Arlington or Harlington, with Dawley, formerly the ſeat of the Bennets, or Tankerville family, gave them the title of Baron, in 1663, which title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs now to the Duke of Grafton, deſcended by the female line, from the only daughter of John Bennet, Baron Arlington.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Sipſon on the right.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Harmondſworth on the right.</p>
            <p>We now paſs the pretty village of Longford, and the road becomes more pleaſant.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> As we approach Colnbrooke, we catch occaſional glances of Windſor Caſtle, on the left; about four miles diſtant.</p>
            <p>Juſt before we reach Colnbrooke, we paſs the road on the left, leading to Staines, a merket town, about ſix miles diſtant on the Exeter road.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Colnbrook ſtands on the river Coln, over which there is a ſmall bridge. Part of this town is in Middleſex, but the greater part in Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. It has a market, a charity-ſchool, and a chapel, founded by Edward III. and ſome good inns. This place is ſuppoſed to be the ancient Pontes. On the right of Colnbrook, is a ſmall villa, called Percy Lodge, the ſeat of the Earl of Tankerville, and was once the reſidence of Frances, Dutcheſs of Somerſet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1288701200:8"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Langley on the right, where is a handſome ſeat and park, called Langley, belonging to Sir Robert Bateſon Hervey, worth going to ſee, the adjoining land bearing the character of the ſcenery about the Alps. It was ſold to the preſent poſſeſſor by the Duke of Marlborough.</p>
            <p>About two miles on the left, is the village of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Datchet, in which was a bridge over the Thames, leading to Windſor Little Park. It has now fallen to decay, and is impaſſable; and, being a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bridge, it is uncertain when it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</p>
            <p>After paſſing Colnbrook, in our way to Slough, the country on the left is more liverly, and Windſor Caſtle is frequently in view; alſo the town and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Eton, in the valley below it.</p>
            <p>Upton about a mile on the left.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>Slough is a large village in the road, about a mile and a half from Windſor. It conſiſts of one ſtreet, and contains ſome good inns. Near this, on the left of the Windſor road, leading from this place, lives the celebrated Doctor Herſchell. The apparatus which gives motion to his grand tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, is ſeen from the high road; his eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is at the expence of the King.</p>
            <p>Windſor Caſtle has been a royal reſidence, with ſome interruptions, from the conqueſt to the preſent time. William I. was the firſt who built a palace here; Henry I. fortified it, and Edward III. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1288701200:9"/>it. Eton College was founded by Henry VI. the chapel is a ſtately Gothic ſtructure, and may be ſeen from the road.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> A little beyond Slough, on the right, near the road, is the temporary reſidence of the Earl of Cheſterfield. Hence a road leads to Stoke, a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage formerly called Stoke-Pogies, from its being the inheritance of the Lords of Pogies, from whom it paſſed to the family of Haſtings. From this family it became the property of Lady Cobham, and was purchaſed from her by Mr. Penn, of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, and is now in the hands of his ſucceſſor. In Stoke church-yard is interred, the celebrated Poet, Gray.</p>
            <p>Salt Hill has little more to be noticed than one or two good inns. To this place the Eton ſcholars parade once in two years, to diſtribute ſalt, and collect money of travellers, according to an ancient cuſtom.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> On the right is the village of Farnham Royal, held by its preſent poſſeſſor on condition of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the King, on his coronation-day, with a right hand glove, and ſupporting his right arm whilſt he holds the ſceptre. When the anceſtors of the preſent Earl of Shrewſbury exchanged this place with Henry VIII. they reſerved this privilege.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> Huntercomb on the left. On the right Burnham, a village noted for an Auguſtine monaſtery, founded in 1265 by Richard, King of the Romans; cloſe to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1288701200:10"/>this, in view of the Bath road, is a houſe of Lady Ravenſworth.</p>
            <p>A houſe on the left belonging to Mr. Ayres.</p>
            <p>Hitcham on the right.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/>
            </p>
            <p>As we approach Maidenhead-bridge the country <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> becomes more pictureſque, and we ſee, on the right, the woody hills of Taploe, belonging to the Earl of Inchiquin, where many genteel people reſide.</p>
            <p>On the ſummit of the hill, between the village of Taploe and the Thames, is the ſeat of the Earl of Inchiquin, called Cliefden Houſe. It was built by Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, in Charles I'ſt reign, purchaſed by the firſt Earl of Orkney, and, by marriage, is now in poſſeſſion of the Earl of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiquin. Frederic Prince of Wales, father of the preſent King, reſided here in the ſummer.</p>
            <p>Adjoining Cliefden is Hedſor Lodge, the ſeat of Lord Boſton, ſtanding on an eminence; below which, in the valley, is the ſeat of Sir George Yonge, a houſe lately built.</p>
            <p>At Maidenhead-bridge, we enter Berkſhire, from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Bucks. At the foot of the bridge, on each ſide, is a noted inn, and ſome gentlemens' houſes on the Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire ſide, one lately built by Sir William Herne. The bridge is a handſome ſtone ſtructure, (about 15 years old,) built from a deſign of Sir R. Taylor. From hence the beautiful ſcenery of Cliefden, on the

            <p>Maidenhead is a town of ſome conſequence, its borough was founded by Edward III. and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by James II. The town ſtands in the pariſh of Bray, to the left; and that of Cookham, to the right.</p>
            <p>Adjoining Maidenhead, on the ſouth, is the ſeat of P. Pouney, Eſq. an old houſe, with a new park.</p>
            <p>From Maidenhead, a hollow way leads to the ſummit of a hill; from whence to the north, the three villas of Cliefden, Taploe, and Hedſor Lodge, appear emboſomed in wood.</p>

On the right, near the edge of the common, is a houſe, the reſidence of the late Charles Ambler, Eſq. Solicitor General to the Queen. Towards the ſouth are two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome houſes, one belonging to Miſs Lowndes, and the ſmaller to a Mr. Lee.</p>
            <p>Here a road branches to the weſt, leading to Hall Place, the ſeat of Sir William Eſte, Baronet, about a mile diſtant. It has a beautiful park, but ſmall.

On the left, between the 29th and 30th mile ſtone, is the village of Shotteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook, where are the remains of a monaſtery of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictines, now converted into a farm-houſe.

            <p>Beyond this ſtone is the houſe of Mrs. Phillips, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> commanding extenſive views; and nearly adjoining, a houſe with wings, belonging to Mr. Ximenes. Oppoſite to this, near the road, on a ſloping lawn, is the ſeat of John Lee Parrot, Eſq. on the eaſt and ſouth of this, is a woody valley.</p>
            <p>Hare Hatch is juſt beyond the 32 mile ſtone, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> ſmall ſtraggling village, with ſome good houſes; particularly that of Mr. Young on the right, and Mr. Girdler towards the left. Here we leave the wood-land, and dip into an open cultivated country. About a mile hence, on a riſing country, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> on the left, ſtands the village of Ruſcombe; cloſe to which is an elegant houſe, the ſeat of Lord Chief

            <p>From Twyford there is a road a mile and a half to Wargrave, a pleaſant town, ſituated on the banks of the Thames, where the late Earl of Barrymore reſided, and had an elegant theatre for his own amuſement. Twyford was formerly a market town. Queen Emma gave it to the Biſhop of Wincheſter; it was annexed to this ſee, till Biſhop Poynet gave it to Edward VI. who granted it to Henry Neville. Queen Mary took it from him, and gave it to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop White, Poynet's ſucceſſor; but Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth reſtored it to Neville, and with his poſterity it has continued.</p>
            <p>Twyford is a ſmall town, about five miles eaſt of Reading, ſituated near the conflux of the Thames and the Loddon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Beyond Twyford the road runs through a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of rich meadows, watered by numerous ſtreams from the Loddon, which empties itſelf into the Thames, a little below the town, on the north. Further on, the road continues on a level for ſome diſtance; then aſcending, runs on an unequal ridge, through an encloſed, woody country, to the 37th mile ſtone: it then deſcends towards Reading, which we ſee before us in the weſt, and Caveſham Park on the right, beyond the Thames.</p>

            <p>Caverſham Park two miles north of Reading, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> near the road from Thame to Henley, is the ſeat of Mr. Marſac. The houſe was built by the Earl of Cadogan, in the reign of George I. Lord Cadogan was created Baron Reading, in 1715; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Viſcount Caverſham, for ſignalizing himſelf under the Duke of Marlborough, in ſuppreſſing the Rebellion of 1715.</p>
            <p>About two miles on his ſide Reading, a road, on the left, leads to White Knights, lately the ſeat of Sir Henry Inglefield, now Mr. Neville's. It is a ſtately building, in a pleaſant park. This place was one of the firſt examples of the <hi>Ferme Ornée.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the left, a little beyond this, one mile from Reading, is Early Court, the reſidence of J. Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Eſq..</p>
            <p>A new road through Crambourne Chace, Windſor foreſt, 18 miles in length, has not long ſince been made, by permiſſion, through the pleaſant villages of Wingfield, Warfield, and Binfield, and from the number of elegant ſeats on this road, and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſcenery about it, it is one of the moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful roads in the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Reading, 39 miles from London, is ſeated on an eaſy declivity, on the ſouth-ſhore of the Thames. The ſtreets are ſpacious, and well-paved, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome good houſes. The river Kennet runs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1288701200:15"/>through the town in two ſeparate ſtreams, and falls into the Thames, a mile below it; barges come up to the town by the river. It is the county town, is governed by a Mayor, 12 Aldermen, and 12 Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, and ſends two members to Parliament. It has three pariſh churches, and is ſaid to have been a borough ſoon after the Conqueſt. It was anciently in poſſeſſion of the Danes, who ſurrendered it to the Saxons in 827.</p>
            <p>A magnificent abbey was founded here by Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I. about 1124: Henry I. and his Queen were buried here. The abbey is deſtroyed, but the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe is ſtill ſtanding, and a venerable ruin it is. Here are two or three ſtage coaches that paſs and repaſs daily between this town and London, and one that goes the foreſt road. There is alſo a coach that goes three times a week from this to Oxford, 40 miles, and returns the alternate days.</p>
            <p>Reading ſtood a ſiege in the civil-war, and made a gallant defence in favour of the King. It had once a woollen manufactory, but its trade conſiſts now chiefly of malt, meal, corn, timber, and ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth. Manufactories of ſilk and lawn have lately been here eſtabliſhed, and meet with encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Very little of the town is ſeen in travelling to Bath, the road paſſing only through one end of it.</p>
            <p>In the Philoſophical Tranſactions we are told, that a ſtratum, or bed of oyſter-ſhells, of 5 or 6 acres in

            <p>A little beyond the 40 mile ſtone, on the left, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> a neat houſe of Miſs Thompſon's.</p>
            <p>From a riſing ground at the weſt end of Reading, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41, 42."/> the road runs along a ridge for two miles, yielding extenſive proſpects to the ſouth. Here, on a hill to the north, is a houſe emboſſomed in wood, the ſeat of Edward Bower, Eſq. and on the oppoſite ſide of the road, on the right, near the 42 mile ſtone, is the reſidence of J. Belgrave, Eſq. It is a handſome building, with wings, ſeated in a pleaſant park. The road on the north, is bounded with wood, and the river Kennet glides along the vale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> on the ſouth. From this ridge, paſſing Calcot Green, we deſcend and approach Theal, which is a neat village, ſkirted by the fertile meadows, and watered by the Kennet; beyond which a chain of woody hills terminates the proſpect.</p>
            <p>About a mile on the right, as we leave Theal, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> Englefield Houſe, the ſeat of Richard Benyon, Eſq. It originally gave name to a very ancient family, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir Henry Englefield.

            <p>Three miles eaſt of this place, once ſtood Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, a Roman city of great note, called Vindo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium, which covered 80 acres of ground. It was built by Conſtantine, in 337: there are now no veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiges left but the walls and gates of the town, which may be conſidered as the moſt perfect remains of Roman greatneſs in this iſland. On the north-eaſt ſide are the traces of an amphitheatre, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a ſtraw-yard.

            <p>Beyond Woolhampton, a large tract of beautiful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> meadows ſpreads the valley on the left; and a chain of woody hills bounds the proſpect on the right.

            <p>From Thatcham the road runs along, up and down hill, till within a mile of Newbury; here it is more level and encloſed, and the country on both right and left, conſiſts of woody hills, interſperſed with farm-houſes; the river Kennet on the left.</p>
            <p>Near Newbury on the right, is Shaw, the ſeat of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54, 55."/> Sir Joſeph Andrews. It is a very ancient manſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> much enveloped in wood. Here Sir George Liſle was poſted at the ſecond of battle of Newbury, in 1644.

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1288701200:19"/>Newbury is a large populous town, 56 miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from London, ſituated in a plain, watered by the Kennet. It roſe out of the ruins of Speen, an old town, called Spine, or Speen; the remains of which now join Newbury. Hence the new town was called New Borough, or Newbury. Part of this place is called Spinham Land.</p>
            <p>The ſtreets are ſpacious, and well paved; and the market-houſe is a handſome building: like Reading, this cannot be ſeen as we paſs it, for the road touches it only at one end. It is a vicarage, in the gift of the Crown; and governed by a Mayor, High Steward, and 8 Burgeſſes; but ſends no members to Parliament. There are ſtage coaches from this place to London, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Newbury was once an ancient clothing town, but this buſineſs is now loſt, in ſome meaſure, by the Kennet having been made navigable here, and carrying on a trade more to the eaſtward. Here lived the famous Jack of Newbury, the greateſt clothier that ever exiſted, having employed 100 looms, in his own houſe, in the reign of Henry VIII. He marched to the battle of Flodden Field, at the head of 100 of his own men, cloathed and maintained by himſelf.</p>
            <p>Newbury is remarkable for two battles in the Civil War, between the King and his Parliament, his Majeſty commanding both in perſon: the firſt was fought at the barrows, on the waſh, two miles
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1288701200:20"/>ſouth-eaſt of the town. In this battle, Sept. 18, 1643, fell, of the King's party, the Earls of Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Carnarvon, and Lord Viſcount Falkland. The ſecond battle was fought the year following, Sunday morning, October 27, 1644, by day-break, at Shaw.</p>
            <p>Lord Portcheſter has an elegant and noble ſeat at High Clere Park, in Hampſhire, five miles ſouth from Newbury. The houſe ſtands by the ſide of a very high hill, a diſtinguiſhed object, and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous landmark.</p>
            <p>From Newbury we proceed to Speenham Land, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> where are one or two very good inns.

            <p>Oppoſite Speen, in a valley on the right, is Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington Grove, the ſeat of Wm. Brummell, Eſq. It is a handſome building, partly Gothic, though lately built by J. Petit Andrews; by whom it was ſold to Mr. Brummel, and may be ſeen from the road. On the hill to the north of it, are the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ruined towers of Donnington Caſtle, rearing its head above a wood of oaks. The Caſtle was a poſt of great conſequence in the Civil War, and ſtood a ſiege of three weeks againſt the rebel army. This Caſtle was alſo the reſidence of the poet Sir Geoffery Chaucer. Alice, daughter of Sir Thomas
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1288701200:21"/>Chaucer, ſon to the Poet, married William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk. On his attainder it came to the Crown; and was afterwards, by grant of Henry VII. given to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.

            <p>Marlborough was a Roman ſtation; and the ſcite of the old Caſtrum was, by the Earl of Hertford, converted into a houſe, and now into an elegant inn, at the weſt end of the town: the Keep is uſed as a mount, for a ſummer houſe.

It originally gave title to James Ley, Lord High Treaſurer, under Charles I. but becoming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in that family, King William, in 1689, made Lord John Churchill, Earl of Marlborough; and Queen Anne afterwards, created him Marquis of Blandford, and Duke of Marlborough.</p>
            <p>Proceeding from Marlborough, and deſcending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="76"/> a hill, a ſhort diſtance from the town, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of large, grey, ſcattered ſtones, are ſeen upon the down, on the right; theſe are vulgarly called

               <hi>the grey wethers;</hi> they are a ſpecies of granite; and lie on the ſurface of the ground in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and of all dimenſions. They are looſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from any rock, and, as Dr. Stukeley thinks, have lain there ever ſince the creation; being ſolid parts thrown out to the ſurface of the fluid globe, when its rotation was firſt impreſſed.</p>

This river is famous for cray-fiſh.</p>
            <p>Proceeding on to the 81 mile-ſtone, we paſs a ſmall hill, or high tumulus, a barrow higher than general, called Silbury Hill, the largeſt of this kind in England. It is of a conical form, 170 feet high, 105 feet diameter at the top, and more than 500 feet at its baſe; having a trench round it, from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1288701200:26"/>which this tumulus was thrown up. This hill has been dug into, and a human ſkeleton was found, bedded in chalk, which crumbled to pieces on touching; near it lay an old horſe-bit, deer's horns, and an iron knife, with a bone handle.</p>
            <p>At Abury, about a mile from this hill, on the right of the road, is the remains of a magnificent Druidical temple. A village has been built within its circle, and out of its ſtones; the gardens and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, &amp;c. have rather disfigured and concealed the great original deſign.</p>
            <p>The whole is ſurrounded with an immenſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular rampart, or terrace, 60 feet broad; and a ditch within of the ſame breadth; the diameter is 1400 feet; the circumference 4,800 feet; and the area incloſed 22 acres; through the centre of which runs the high road from Marlborough to Bath.</p>
            <p>The firſt circle of ſtones within this area, is 13,000 feet diameter, and conſiſts of 100 ſtones from 15 to 17 feet ſquare; reduced, in 1722, to 40; of which, only 17 were ſtanding, and about 43 feet aſunder. There were other circles of ſtones, like thoſe of Stonehenge, at preſent there are only a few ſtones ſtanding.</p>
            <p>Paſſing the 81 mile-ſtone we reach Beckhampton, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="81"/> a ſcattered village, where the two Bath roads meet; that on the left through Devizes; that on the right through Calne and Chippenham. We will purſue this laſt road, and return to the other afterwards.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1288701200:27"/>Sandy Lane Road, which is the way to Chippen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, was the old Bath road, and turned off at She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherd's Shore, beyond the 84 mile ſtone; but a new road is now made through Calne to Chippen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and this turns off at Beckhampton.

            <p>White Horſe Hill takes its name from the figure of a horſe hollowed out in the chalk, on that ſide next the road. It is ſo large as to be ſeen at a great diſtance; and was cut in memory of the victory, obtained by Alfred, over the Danes, near Edding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in the year 878. The figure is 54 feet from the toe to the cheſt, 100 feet from the toe to the point of the ear, and 100 feet from ear to tail. This battle was fought near the village of Edding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where the Daniſh army was encamped.</p>

            <p>Another half mile brings us to Calne, a ſmall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="87"/> neat town, ſituated on a ſtony hill; with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome church, built of freeſtone. This town is well ſupplied with water from Cherhill, and alſo from a ſtream at Calſton, on the left, where ſeveral ſtreams may be ſeen, beautifully guſhing from the ſide of the hill, and forming one ſtream, ſufficient to work a corn-mill below.</p>
            <p>At the entrance of Calne, (by order of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Lanſdown,) the old houſes have been pulled down, and ſmall neat houſes, for the poor, erected in their ſtead. It is a town of great antiquity, and has ſent members to parliament ſince the 26th of Edward I.</p>
            <p>Here ſtood a palace of the Saxon Kings; and, in the controverſy between the Monks and the Prieſts, reſpecting the celibacy of the clergy, a grand coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was held here, in 977; and, during the debate, the floor of the chamber gave way, and many were killed; Dunſtan, who preſided, and who favoured the Monks, eſcaped unhurt, which they conceived as a miracle that confirmed the Monkiſh Law.</p>
            <p>Calne is a market town, and contains near 3000 inhabitants, and conſiderable manufactories of cloth, ſerges, &amp;c.</p>

Bowood Park was once a royal one, and part of the jointure of Catherine Parr, widow of Henry VIII. James I. if ſaid to have hunted here; at which time all the country, on the left of the road, from Calne to Chippenham, was a continued foreſt; afterwards divided, by grant, between the anceſtors of Lord Audley and Mr. Carey, an ancient Roman Catholic family, in Devonſhire; which laſt has lately been purchaſed by Mr. Montague, of Lackham; about 4 miles diſtant.</p>
            <p>Bowood was diſparked in the time of Oliver Cromwell, and granted, for ever, to Sir Orlando Bridgman, a favourite of Charles II. Sir Orlando dying inſolvent, the late Earl of Shelburne bought it of his creditors. To a houſe of 80 feet in front, the late Lord added offices of 300 feet in front, and fronted and encloſed theſe offices with a colonnade, taken from a part of Diocleſians palace, at Spalatro, in Dalmatia; the ſeats in the garden were chiefly taken from the Herculaneum. Within the park is a fine menagerie of wild beaſts.</p>

            <p>Chippenham, ſituated on the river Avon, is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="93"/> large market town, 93 miles from London. It was the ſeat of ſeveral of the Saxon Kings, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed by Alfred to one of his daughters. The Danes fled twice here from Alfred, but gave it up

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="107"/> We have now reached Bath, 107 miles from London, through Chippenham; 108 thro' Devizes.</p>
            <p>Bath is a very ancient city of Somerſetſhire; its hot ſprings are ſaid to have been diſcovered 863 years before Chriſt, by Bladud, from Brute. It is allowed to have been, formerly, a very extenſive city, and to have been firſt reduced by the Romans, about the year 81.</p>
            <p>Bath is ſeated in a very fertile vale, on the banks of the river Avon, and ſurrounded by hills, ſo as to be a very cloſe, warm place, particularly in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. From the bowels of theſe hills, is dug that beautiful freeſtone made uſe in building the city. Its increaſe, within the laſt 60 years, has been great and quick; from a ſmall contracted town, it has extended itſelf into open ſtreets and ſquares, with other elegant buildings in various forms; the whole making a city of conſiderable magnitude, ſo as to aſcend almoſt to the ſummit of the hills about it, and new works are ſtill going on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1288701200:40"/>The heat of the waters in the different baths, are as follow, according to Farenheit's Thermometer: The water in the King's bath, raiſes the mercury in its coldeſt place to 100 degrees; in its hotteſt, to 103 degrees. The hot bath exceeds this by ſome degrees; the degrees of heat in the Croſs bath, is 94; and in the Queen's bath, 99.</p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen aſſemble every morning from 7 till 10, to drink the waters.</p>
            <p>The amuſements are various, rational, and well-conducted. There are two ſets of aſſembly rooms, where the amuſements are alternately held, and a theatre. Here are two hoſpitals, and four churches, including the abbey church. The abbey was founded by Oſric, in 676; but the preſent building was begun in 1495, but not compleated, as it now is, till 1666. It has ſeven doors, and 52 windows, anſwering to the weeks in a year, and the days in a week: the tower is 162 feet high, and has a peel of 10 bells. Here are 12 other places of worſhip, and a public grammar ſchool, endowed by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VI.</p>
            <p>Bath is governed by a Mayor, Recorder, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and 20 Common Council; ſends two members to Parliament, and is the ſee of a Biſhop, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Wells. Here is a court of Record, that takes cognizance of debts above 40<hi>s,</hi> and a Court of Conſcience, that determines matters under that ſum.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1288701200:41"/>It has two markets weekly, Wedneſdays and Fridays; and well ſupplied, particularly with fiſh.</p>
            <p>Bath being ſurrounded with very high hills, which are unpleaſant to climb, very few people like to keep carriages. It is a remarkably clean place, and, lying on ſuch a declivity, it is ſoon waſhed clean by a ſhower of rain, and is ſoon dry enough to walk upon, without ſoiling the ſhoes; and, for the accommodation of going to the rooms dreſſed, ſedan-chairs are always at hand, for 6<hi>d.</hi> or 1<hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The country round the city, is embelliſhed with gentlemens ſeats; the moſt diſtinguiſhed is Prior Park, the ſeat of the late Ralph Allen.</p>
            <p>Lanſdown over-hangs the city, and is renowned for a battle in the Civil Wars, on July 5, 1643, when the King's forces beat thoſe of the Parliament. A monument is erected on it, in commendation of the above-mentioned victory, by George Lord Lanſdown, in 1720.</p>
            <p>The river Avon has been made navigable from Bath to Briſtol, and makes the intercourſe between them great. There are two roads to Briſtol; the diſtance, 13 miles: one called the Upper Road; and the other, the Lower. The Upper runs from the weſt end of the city, along the northern ſide of the river, and through a part of Glouceſterſhire; the Lower, and the moſt frequented, winds along the ſouthern bank of the river, from the old bridge;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1288701200:42"/>and a communication between theſe two roads, is formed by a handſome ſtone bridge, of one arch, over the ſame river, about two miles and a half be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the town.</p>
            <p>Paſſing then over the bridge, the Lower Road, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we ſoon reach Twiverton, two miles from Bath; and a little beyond the 3d mile-ſtone, Newton, a ſmall town, ſcattered along the ſide of a hill; near <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which, on the ſouth or left, ſtands Newton Park, the ſeat of George Langton, Eſq.. On the other ſide of the river, on a high ridge, ſtands a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome houſe, the reſidence of ſome of the family of the late Sir Caeſar Hawkins, who lived occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally here.</p>
            <p>The Vale of Bath, through which the Avon runs, is beautiful in all its parts, and worth the travellers' notice.</p>
            <p>Proceeding on from Newton, we leave the village <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of Corſtan on the left, and paſs through Saltford; on the right of which, on the Avon ſide, are ſeveral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5, 6."/> copper and braſs mills. Hence the road riſes, and we paſs through a rich country towards Keynſham, eight miles and a half from Bath.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7, 8."/>
            </p>
            <p>Before we reach Keynſham, we ſee a handſome houſe on the north; this belongs to Edward Lyne, Eſq.</p>
            <p>Keynſham is a ſmall market town, ſtanding on two hills, on the ſouth bank of the Avon, with a ſmall bridge over the river Chew, which runs by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1288701200:43"/>it. The counties of Gloceſter and Somerſet are joined by a larger bridge over the Avon, below the town.</p>
            <p>Keynſham Church is of Gothic ſtructure, and the high grounds beyond the town, have a beautiful effect.</p>
            <p>Paſſing Keynſham, the houſe on the right is Mr. Butcher's.</p>
            <p>At Stanton Drew, a few miles from Keynſham, are the remains of a Druid Temple, known by the name of <hi>the Wedding,</hi> from a vulgar opinion, that a bride and her attendants were changed into theſe ſtones. This temple, ſays Mr. Wood, conſiſted of three circles of ſtones, and formed a model of the Pythagorean Syſtem of the planetary world.</p>
            <p>From Keynſham we deſcend into an encloſed wood-land country, leaving Keynſham Park on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> right; beyond which we riſe another hill, and from the top, about three miles from Briſtol, we have exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive proſpects: here we paſs a colliery.</p>
            <p>Between the nine and ten mile-ſtones, the houſe on the right is Mr. Weirs; that on the left Mr. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's.</p>
            <p>From the above-mentioned hill, we deſcend to</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Briſlington; and, on our approach to Briſtol, a great number of handſome houſes and villas, lie ſcattered on both ſides the road.</p>
            <p>Beyond Briſlington we go down an avenue of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> ſtately trees, paſſing a fine ſloping valley of rich
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1288701200:44"/>verdure, on the left; and a more cultivated country on the right: and again paſſing many handſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> villas, winding round a hill, we get a full view of Briſtol. Beyond this the road riſes to the city.</p>
            <p>A little beyond the 12 mile-ſtone, on the left, is the high road to Wells.</p>
            <p>Briſtol is 120 miles from London through Bath, but 6 miles nearer through Chippenham and Marſhfield: it ſtands part in Somerſetſhire, and part in Glouceſterſhire, the two counties being divided by the river Avon.</p>
            <p>This city is a county within itſelf, made ſo by Edward III. and Henry VIII. made it a biſhop's ſee. It has 3 handſome ſquares, and 18 churches, beſides the cathedral, which ſtands in Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. The church of St. Mary Redcliff, is worthy attention, being the moſt beautiful ſtructure of the kind in the kingdom: its roof is a ſolid arch of freeſtone.</p>
            <p>Briſtol ſends two members to Parliament; and is governed by a Mayor, Recorder, 12 Aldermen, two Sheriffs, and 42 Common Council.</p>
            <p>About a mile weſt of Briſtol, in Glouceſterſhire, is the village of Clifton, ſeated on the ſide of a high hill, extending to the river Avon, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of many perſons of fortune. It has a parade, a ſquare, and other handſome buildings, fitted up for the accommodation of thoſe who reſort here for pleaſure, or for health. There are two aſſembly-rooms,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1288701200:45"/>for the amuſement of the company, on the plan of thoſe at Bath.</p>
            <p>At the weſtern extremity of Clifton, near the lofty rock of St. Vincent's riſes the Briſtol hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings; the heat of which, by Fahrenheit's Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer, is 76 degrees.</p>
            <p>THIS Deſcription of the Road from London to Bath, will ſerve to conduct the traveller from Bath to London, if he reads it from the end to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and remembers that thoſe places which in his way down to Bath were repreſented to be on the right of the road; in his way back, muſt be on the left, and <hi>vicé verſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is a ſecond road to Bath from London, as I have obſerved, to which I whould give the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, for many reaſons. In the firſt place, it avoids the hills between Marlborough and Devizes, and, of courſe, ſaves time upon the journey: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, being leſs frequented, is not ſo duſty in ſummer, or ſo much worn in winter: thirdly, a traveller is not ſo likely to be ſtopped by a run of poſt-chaiſes, or be obliged to go on with tired horſes: and, laſtly, inns are not ſo expenſive. This road is through Staines, Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-bridge, Baſingſtoke, Andover, Luggerſhal,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1288701200:46"/>Everley, and Devizes. To Bath, this way, is one mile more, but the advantages more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate it; the country is equally beaut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h Weyhill Fair, the greateſt in the kingdom; and if we would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with a mile or two more on our journey, and go through Ambreſbury, inſtead of Everley and Devizes, the road is good, and we paſs cloſe by that ſuperb piece of antiquity, the Druidical Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Stonehenge, which every perſon of taſte and curioſity goes to ſee; and the road this way is not above two or three miles round.</p>
            <p>I know the Bath road through Reading, has been admired for the good accommodations met with at the different inns, but all inns are now improved; and there are none that excel <hi>Demeſay's</hi> at Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-bridge, and ſome others on the way: indeed, the accommodations at <hi>Demeſay's</hi> are ſo excellent, that the Royal Family, ſenſible of it, make a point always of dining or ſupping there, in their journey to and from Weymouth.</p>
            <p>If the traveller, (let him be of what caſt he will) wiſhes to be amuſed on his journey, or at Bath, <hi>Dr. Truſler</hi> ventures to recommend to his peruſal, the two following books; they will afford him a fund of entertainment, being full of laughable anecdote, and make him acquainted with the arts, fineſſe, and deceptions of the age, in all profeſſions
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1288701200:47"/>of life. They are a true and very pointed ſatire on men and manners, and moſt of the characters are now living: though written in the form of Novels, they are good <hi>library books,</hi> and will bear reading again and again.</p>
