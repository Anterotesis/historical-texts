            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE author of the following poem is apprehenſive, that neither he nor the objects of his ſatire, are of conſequence enough to engage attention to ſo long a piece as he has been drawn into by the nature of his ſubject; but as he has been peſtered with defamatory pieces for ſeveral months paſt, with ROSCIADS, APOLOGIES, MURPHYADS, MERETRICIADS, &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. and as it muſt be imagined that the men, who have miſcarried of all theſe libels have found encouragement from ſome ſorts of readers, it is now hoped that they who have afforded leiſure for a peruſal of the pieces againſt the preſent writer, will do him the juſtice to hear him ſpeak for himſelf. He is ſorry that he has been obliged to employ his time in this ſort of controverſy, which he deſpiſes as a thing illiberal in itſelf, diſhonourable to letters, and generally the mean ſubterfuge of thoſe who want to make a livelihood of an author's name; but he thought the rancour diſcharged againſt him merited a retort, not for the miſchief it had done, but on account of the malignity of the deſign. Excited by this motive, he took up the pen, and as Mr. POPE ſays of his imitations of Horace, he thought an anſwer upon BOILEAU'S model would be more full, and of more dignity than any he could have made in his own perſon. He has only to add, that he does not intend to maintain theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by carrying on a paper-war; for unleſs he has ſome extreme
<pb facs="tcp:0499400900:3"/>provocation, and that too with more wit than they have hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, he is determined to look down upon them with a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſilence for the future; his writings, ſhould they attack them, will ſpeak, though feebly, for themſelves; and his morals, if tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, will falſify their ſlander, and tell each of them aloud (to uſe the words adopted by a noble prelate on a ſimilar occaſion) <hi>Mentiris Impudentiſſime!</hi>

                  <hi>N. B.</hi> The Reader will obſerve that <hi>EXPOSTULATION</hi> ſtands at the Head of the Poem, though changed for another Word in the Title-Page; and this muſt be accounted for.—The very Men who provoked the Author to this Piece began to crouch from the Laſh as ſoon as they heard it was hanging over them; and to weaken its Effect, they immediately advertiſed a Poem, called <hi>The EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSTULATION.</hi> It was therefore thought proper not to cancel what was then printed off, but (to prevent the Confuſion of two Pieces with the ſame Name) to give the ſubſequent Poem a new Title-Page; and now the Sons of Darkneſs are welcome to avail themſelves of their Deſign, truly worthy of ſuch liberal Men!</p>
