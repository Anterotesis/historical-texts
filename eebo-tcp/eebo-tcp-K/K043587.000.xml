            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT very much ſurprizes me that ſix Editions of a Mythological Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, entituled, <hi>A Diſſertation on Dumpling,</hi> ſhould eſcape your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that wonderful Unriddler of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries the ingenious Mr. <hi>E—C</hi>—who has at the ſame Time given ſuch Proofs of his Abilities in his many and moſt elaborate Keys to <hi>Gulliver</hi>'s Travels; Keys, which <hi>Gulliver</hi> himſelf could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have found out! and withal, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, that I ſhall eſteem thoſe at the Helm, no great Lovers of Learning, if my Friend <hi>Edmund</hi> be not forthwith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted: for as the Sweetneſs of a Kernel

is uncomatable, but by the Fracture of its Shell, ſo is the Beauty of a Myſtery altogether hid, till the Expounder has riddlemayreed the Propounder's Problem, and render'd it obvious to the meaneſt Capacity.</p>
            <p>The only Plea I can uſe in Mr. <hi>C—'s</hi> bchalf, is, that the Author of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation has been a little too free with his Character, which probably occaſioned that Sullenneſs in our <hi>Britiſh Oedipus;</hi> who in Order to be revenged, has deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to embeliſh the Work with his Interpretation, but rather let it rot and periſh in Oblivion.</p>
            <p>This, and nothing elſe, could be the Reaſon of ſo profound a Silence in ſo great a Myſterymonger, to remedy which Loſs to the Publick, I an unworthy Scribler, and faint Copier of that great Artiſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume with aching Heart, and trembling Hand, to draw the Veil which ſhades the political Pamphlet in Queſtion; and ſhow it to my loving Countrymen in <hi>Puris Naturalibus.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0076602000:5"/>
If I ſucceed in this, I hope Mr. <hi>L—t,</hi> who all the World knows is a rare Chap to his Authors, will ſpeedily employ me to unriddle, or at leaſt make a Plot to the <hi>Rival Modes,</hi> which it ſeems the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has omitted: it is true, he ought to have given it the Bookſeller with the Copy, but has not ſo done, which makes me wonder he is not ſued for Breach of Covenant; but what is that to me, if I get a Job by the Bargain? Let Bookſellers beware how they buy Plays without Plots for the future.</p>
            <p>I narrowly miſs'd ſolving the Problem called <hi>Wagner</hi> and <hi>Abericock;</hi> Mr. <hi>B</hi>—had ſpoke to Mr. <hi>W—</hi>to ſpeak to Mr. <hi>C—,</hi> who had juſt conſented to employ me, after having made me abate half my Demand: But Houſes running thin, <hi>Colley</hi> has undertaken the Job him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſave Charges; intending at the ſame Time, to annex a ſevere Criticiſm on <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proſerpine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, gentle Reader, will, I hope, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to look on me as a Writer of ſome Regard, and at the ſame Time,<hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0076602000:6"/>
               </hi>to make a little Allowance for whatever Errors my great Hurry may occaſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to write Night and Day, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days and working Days, without the leaſt Aſſiſtance. All our Journeymen Writers being now turned Maſters, I am left to ſhiſt for my ſelf; but am bringing up my Wife to the Buſineſs, and doubt not but a long War, and our mutual Induſtry, may rub off old Scores, and make us begin a new Reckoning with all Mankind; Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteering having been ſo dead for many Years laſt paſt, that (God forgive me!) I have been oftentimes tempted to write Treaſon for mere Suſtenance.</p>
            <p>But Thanks to better Stars and better Days, the Pen revives, and Authors flouriſh; more Money can be made now of a Play, nay, though it be a ſcurvy One, than <hi>Dryden</hi> got by all his Works. Thereſore now or never is the Time to ſtrike while the Iron is hot, to write my ſelf out of Debt, and into Place, and then grow idle and laugh at the World, as my Betters have done before me.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN a Book has met with Succeſs, it never wants a Father; there being thoſe good natured Souls in the World, who, rather than let Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind think ſuch Productions ſprang of themſelves, will own the Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond Brat, and thereby become Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of other Mens Offsprings.</p>
            <p>This was the Fate of Dumpling, whoſe real Father did not take more Care to conceal himſelf, than ſome did to be thought its Author; but if any one will recollect the Time of its Publication, they will find it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0076602000:8"/>
a Week after the Arrival of D—n <hi>S—t,</hi> from <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Occaſion, as I am very well informed, was this, the D—n, one of the firſt Things he did, went to pay a Viſit to Mr. <hi>T—,</hi> his old Bookſeller; but, to his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, found both the Brothers dead, and a Relation in the Shop, to whom he was an utter Stranger. Mr. <hi>M—</hi>for ſuch is this Perſon's Name, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering from the D—n's Enquiries who he was, paid him his <hi>Devoirs</hi> in the moſt reſpectful Manner, ſolicited his Friendſhip, and invited him to a Dinner, which the D—n was pleaſed to accept. By the Way, you muſt know, he is a great Lover of Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, as well as the Bookſeller, who had ordered one for himſelf, little dreaming of ſuch a Gueſt that Day. The Dinner, as 'twas not provided on purpoſe, was but a Family one, well enough however for a Bookſeller; that is to ſay, a couple of Fowls, Bacon and Sprouts boiled, and a Forequarter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0076602000:9"/>
of Lamb roaſted. After the uſual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements for the unexpected Honour, and the old Apology of wiſhing it was better for his ſake: The Maid, ſilly Girl! came and asked her Maſter if he pleaſed to have his Dumpling; he would have chid her, but the D—n mollified him, inſiſting at the ſame Time, upon the Introduction of Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, which accordingly was done. Dumpling gave Cauſe of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not till it was eat; for the Reader muſt underſtand, that both the Gentlemen play a good Knife and Fork, and are too mannerly to talk with their Mouths full. The Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling eat, as I ſaid before, the D—n drank to the Bookſeller, the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller to the Author, and with an obſequious Smile, ſeem'd to ſay ah! Dear Doctor, you have been a Friend to my Predeceſſor, can you do nothing for me? The D—n took the Hint, and after a profound Contemplation, cry'd, Why ay—Dumpling will do—
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0076602000:10"/>
put me in Mind of Dumpling anon, but not a Word more at preſent, and good Reaſon why, Dinner was coming in. So they paſt the reſt of the Meal with great Silence and Application, and no doubt dined well. Far otherwiſe was it with me that Day: I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to my Sorrow, I had a Hogs Maw, without Salt or Muſtard; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that Time, Credit with the Pork-Woman, but not with the Chandler: Times are ſince mended, <hi>Amen</hi> to the Continuance!</p>
            <p>The D—n, having eat and drank plentifully, began his uſual Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and made the Bookſeller mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Ears with his Mouth, nay, burſt his Sides with Laughter; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he found Interval enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind the D—n of Dumpling, who asked him if he had a quick Hand at Writing: he excuſed himſelf, being naturally as Lazy as the other was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent, ſo they contrived to eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſending for a Hackney Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0076602000:11"/>
out of <hi>Temple Lane</hi> to be the D—'s <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> while he and his new Acquaintance crack'd t'other Bottle.</p>
            <p>This Account may be depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe I had it from the Man himſelf, who ſcorns to tell a Lye.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, my Friend had the worſt of it, being kept to hard Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, without Drinking (Churls that they were) about three Hours; in which Time the Diſſertation was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that is to ſay, from Page 1. to Page 25. the reſt might probably be done at ſome other leiſure Time, to fill up the Chinks, but of that he knows nothing; ſufficient is it that the D—n was the Author. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we now to the other Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by drawing the Veil from before the Book it ſelf.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall begin with his Motto, which ſays, <hi>What is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Pudding?</hi> The Body owns its Power, the Mind, its Delicacy; it will give Youth to grey Hairs, and Life to the moſt Deſponding: Therefore are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0076602000:13"/>
Pudding Eaters of great Uſe in State Affairs.</p>
            <p>This Quotation is of a Piece with his Motto to the Tale of a Tub, and other Writings; altogether Fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Drole: he adds to the Jeſt, by putting an Air of Authority or genuine Quotation from ſome great Author; when alas! the whole is mere Farce and Invention.</p>
            <p>The Dedication is one continued Sneer upon Authors, and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and ſeems to carry a Glance of Deriſion towards Men of Quality in General; by ſetting a Cook above them, as a more uſeful Member in a body Politick. Some will have this <hi>Braund,</hi> to be Sir ****, others Sir ****, others Sir ****; but I take it to be more Railery than Myſtery, and that Mr. <hi>Braund,</hi> at the <hi>Rummer</hi> in <hi>Queen-ſtreet,</hi> is the Perſon; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pleas'd the Author in two or three Entertainments, he, with a View truly <hi>Epicurean,</hi> conſtitutes him

his <hi>Maecenas;</hi> as being more agreeable to him than a whole Circle of Stars and Garters, of what Colour or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination ſoever.</p>
            <p>In his Tale of a Tub, he has a fling at Dependance, and Attendance, where he talks of a Body worn out with Poxes ill cured, and Shooes with Dependance, and Attendance. Not having the Book by me, I am forced to quote at Random, but I hope the courteous Reader will bear me out. He complains of it again in this Treatiſe, and makes a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Mr. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Braund</hi>'s late Servant; who keeps the <hi>Braund</hi>'s <hi>Head</hi> in <hi>New Bond-ſtreet,</hi> near <hi>Hanover-Square;</hi> a Houſe of great Elegance, and where he uſed frequently to dine.</p>
            <p>The Diſtinction of <hi>Brand, Braund,</hi> and <hi>Barnes,</hi> is a Banter on Criticks, and Genealogiſts, who make ſuch a Pother about the Orthography of Names and Things, that many Times, three Parts in four of a Folio Treatiſe,

            <p>I heartily wiſh ſome of theſe Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſographiſts would oblige the World with a Folio Treatiſe or two, on the Word Rabbet: We ſhall then know whether it is to be ſpelt with an <hi>e,</hi> or an <hi>i.</hi> For, to the Shame of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Tongue and this learned Age, our moſt eminent Phyſicians, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, Anatomiſts and Men Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, have all been to ſeek in this Affair.</p>

            <p>The Maſter-Key to this Myſtery, is the Explanation of its Terms; for Example, by <hi>Dumpling</hi> is meant a Place, or any other Reward or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. A <hi>Pudding</hi> ſignifies a P—t, and ſometimes a C—tee. A <hi>Dumpling Eater,</hi> is a Dependant on the Court, or, in a Word, any one who will rather pocket an Affront than be angry at a Tip in Time. A <hi>Cook</hi> is a Miniſter of State. The <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Peripatetic</hi> Sects, are the two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Whigg</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> who both are greedy enough of Dumpling.</p>
            <p>The Author cannot forbear his old Sneer upon Foreigners, but ſays, in his 1ſt Page, <q>That finding it a Land of Plenty, they wiſely reſolved never to go home again,</q> and in his 2d, <q>Nay, ſo zealous are they in the Cauſe of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> that one of the Chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, made a Vow never to ſay his Prayers till he has a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0076602000:17"/>
Tavern of his own in every Street in <hi>London,</hi> and in every Market-Town in <hi>England:</hi>
               </q> If he does not mean Sir <hi>J—T—</hi>I know not who he means.</p>
            <p>By the Invention of <hi>Eggs,</hi> Page 4. is meant Perquiſites. <q>He cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Paragraph, in his 5th <hi>Page,</hi> without owning he received that important Part of the Hiſtory of Pudding, from old Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> of <hi>Wilſden Green,</hi> the greateſt Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the preſent Age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This old <hi>Lawrence</hi> is a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of the D—'s; he is a facetious Farmer, of above eighty Years of Age, now living at <hi>Wilſden Green,</hi> near <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> the moſt rural Place I ever ſaw: exactly like the Wilds of <hi>Ireland.</hi> It was here the D—n often retired <hi>incog.</hi> to amuſe himſelf with the Simplicity of the Place and People; where he got together all that Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayroll of Childrens talk, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his <hi>Namby Pamby.</hi> Old <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0076602000:18"/>
told me, the D—n has ſate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hours together to ſee the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren play, with the greateſt Pleaſure in Life: The reſt he learned from the old Nurſes thereabouts, of which there are a great many, with whom he would go and ſmoke a Pipe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and cordially; not in his Clergyman's Habit, but in a black Suit of Cloth Clothes, and without a Roſe in his Hat: Which made them conclude him to be a Presbyterian Parſon.</p>
            <p>This Mention of old <hi>Lawrence,</hi> is in Ridicule to a certain great Artiſt, who wrote a Treatiſe upon the Word <hi>Connoiſſeur</hi> (or a Knower) and confeſſes himſelf to have been many Years at a loſs for a Word to expreſs the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Knowing, till the great Mr. <hi>Prior</hi> gave him Eaſe, by furniſhing him with the Word <hi>Connoiſſance.</hi> Our D—n had drawn a Drole, Parallel to this, <hi>viz. Boudineur,</hi> a Pudding Pye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and <hi>Boudinance,</hi> the making of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0076602000:19"/>
Pudding Pies: But ſeveral Men of Quality begging it off, it was, at their Requeſt, ſcratch'd out, but my Friend, the <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> remembers particularly its being originally inſerted.</p>
            <p>If the Reader ſhould ask, Who is that K<hi>—John</hi> mentioned in the fourth Page, and which I ought to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in its Place. I beg leave to inform him, that by K. <hi>John</hi> is meant the late Q.—, with whom the D—of <hi>M—</hi>was many Years in ſuch great Favour, that he was nick named K. <hi>John;</hi> it was in that Part of the Q—'s Reign, that Sir <hi>John</hi> Pudding, by whom is meant **** <hi>you know who,</hi> came in Favour; it is true, the Name is odd, and ſeems to carry an Air of Ridicule with it, but the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter given him by this allegorical Writer, is that of an able Stateſman, and an honeſt Man.</p>
            <p>And here, begging Mr. D—n's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I cannot but think his Wit has out run his Judgment; for he puts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0076602000:20"/>
the Cart before the Horſe, and begins at the latter Part of Sir **** Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration: But this might be owing to too plentiful a Dinner, and too much of the Creature. Be that as it will, I muſt follow my Copy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it as it lies. Proceed we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Diſſertation, <hi>Page</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But what rais'd our Hero moſt in the Eſteem of this Pudding-eating Monarch, was his ſecond Edition of Pudding, he being the firſt that ever invented the Art of broiling Puddings, which he did to ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſo much to the King's liking (who had a mortal Averſion to cold Pudding) that he thereupon inſtituted him Knight of the Grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iron, and gave him a Gridiron of Gold, the Enſign of that Order; which he always wore as a Mark of his Sovereign's Favour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If this does not mean the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of an ancient Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I never will unriddle Myſtery
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0076602000:21"/>
more: To prove which, we need but croſs over to the next Page, where he tells us, <q>Sir <hi>John</hi> had always a Squire, who followed him, bearing a huge Pair of Spectacles to ſaddle his Honour's Noſe. <bibl>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After this, he very ſeverely runs upon thoſe would-be Stateſmen, who put themſelves in Competition with his Favourite, Sir ****, with whom he became exceeding intimate, and almoſt inſeperable, all the Time he was in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Story of the Kit Cat Club, <hi>Dick Eſtcourt,</hi> and <hi>Jacob Tonſon,</hi> is a mere Digreſſion; and nothing more to the Purpoſe, than that we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it came uppermoſt. He returns to his Subject in his 9th <hi>Page.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now it was Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Method, every <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, to give the Courtiers a Breakfaſt; which Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt was every Man his Dumpling, and Cup of Wine: For you muſt know, he was Yeoman of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0076602000:22"/>
Wine-Cellar at the ſame Time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Breakfaſt is Sir *** Levee, the Yeomanſhip of the Wine-Cellar, is the ***.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Diſſertation, is a very bad Chronologiſt; for at <hi>Page</hi> 10. we are obliged to go back to the former Reign, where we ſhall find the lubberly Abbots <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the High Church Prieſts, miſrepreſenting Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Actions, and never let the Q—alone, till poor Sir <hi>John</hi> was diſcarded.</p>
            <q>
               <p>This was a great Eye-ſore, and Heart-burning to ſome lubberly Abbots, who lounged about the Court; they took it in great Dudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were not invited, and ſtuck ſo cloſe to his Skirts, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſted till they outed him. They told the King, who was naturally very haſty, that Sir <hi>John,</hi> made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away with his Wine, and feaſted his <hi>Paramours</hi> at his Expence; and not only ſo, but they were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0076602000:23"/>
forming a Deſign againſt his Life, which they in Conſcience ought to diſcover: That Sir <hi>John</hi> was not only an Heretic, but an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; nay, worſe, they fear'd he was a Witch, and that he had bewitch'd his Majeſty into that unaccountable Fondneſs for a <hi>Pudding-Maker.</hi> They aſſured the King, that on a <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, inſtead of being at Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, he and his Trigrimates got together hum jum, all ſnug, and perform'd many helliſh and diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Ceremonies. In ſhort, they made the King believe that the Moon was made of Green-Cheeſe: And to ſhew how the Innocent may be bely'd, and the beſt Intentions miſrepreſented, they told the King, That he and his Aſſociates offered Sacrifices to <hi>Ceres:</hi> When, alas, it was only the Dumplings they eat.</p>
               <p>The Butter which was melted and poured over them, theſe vile Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants, called <hi>Libations:</hi> And the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0076602000:24"/>
friendly Compotations of our Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling Eaters, were called <hi>Bacchana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Rites.</hi> Two or three among them being ſweet tooth'd, would ſtrew a little Sugar over their Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plings; this was repreſented as an <hi>Heatheniſh Offering.</hi> In ſhort, not one Action of theirs, but which theſe raſcally Abbots made criminal, and never let the King alone till Sir <hi>John</hi> was diſcarded; not but the King did it with the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance; but they made it a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Concern, and he could not get off on't. <bibl>

            </q>
            <p>All the World knows that the <hi>Tory</hi> Miniſtry got uppermoſt, for the four laſt Years of the Queen's Reign, and by their unaccountable Management, teaz'd that good Lady out of her Life: Which occaſion'd the D—n in his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Page to ſay; <q>Then too late he ſaw his Error; then he lamented the Loſs of Sir <hi>John;</hi> and in his lateſt Moments, would cry out, Oh!
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0076602000:25"/>
that I had never parted from my dear <hi>Jack-Pudding!</hi> Would I had never left off Pudding and Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling! then I had never been thus baſely poiſon'd! never thus treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſent out of the World!—Thus did this good King lament: But alas! to no purpoſe, the Prieſt had given him his Bane, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were ineffectual.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This alludes to Sir **** Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſgrace in the Year—Nay, ſo barefaced is the D—n in his Allegory, that he tells us, in his 12th Page, <hi>Norfolk</hi> was his Aſylum. This is as plain as the Noſe on a Man's Face! The ſubſequent Pages are an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Deſcription of the Ingratitude of Courtiers; and his Fable of the <hi>Court Pudding,</hi> Page 13. is the beſt Part of the whole Diſſertation.</p>
            <p>One would imagine the D—n had been at Sea, by his writing Catharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Faſhion, and dodging the Story ſometimes Twenty-Years backwards,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0076602000:26"/>
at other Times advancing as many; ſo that one knows not where to have him: for in his fifteenth Page, he returns to the preſent Scene of Action, and brings his Hero into the Favour of K<hi>—Harry, alias</hi> **** who being ſenſible of his Abilities, reſtores him into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and makes Uſe of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Skill in Cookery, <hi>alias</hi> State Affairs.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Not one of the King's Cooks could make a Pudding like Sir <hi>John;</hi> nay, though he made a Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before their Eyes, yet they, out of the very ſame Materials, could not do the like: Which made his old Friends, the Monks, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to Witchcraft, and it was currently reported the Devil was his Helper. But good King <hi>Harry</hi> was not to be fobb'd off ſo; the Pudding was good, it ſat very well on his Stomach, and he eat very ſavourly, without the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of Conſcience. <bibl>
                     <hi>Diſſ. Page</hi> 15.</bibl>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0076602000:27"/>
This ſeems to hint at the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition Sir **** met with from the contrary Party, and how ſenſible the K—was, that they were all unable to hold the Staff in Competition with him.</p>
            <p>After this the D—n runs into a whimſical Deſcription of his Heroes perſonal Virtues; but draws the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture too much <hi>Alla Carraccatura,</hi> and is, in my Opinion, not only a little too familiar, but wide of his Subject. For begging his Deanſhip's Pardon, he mightily betrays his Judgment, when he ſays, Sir <hi>John</hi> was no very great Scholar, whereas all Men of Learning allow him to be a moſt excellent one; but as we may ſuppoſe he grew pretty warm by this Time with the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers Wine, he got into his old Knack of Raillery, and begins to run upon all Mankind: In this Mood he falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>C—J—n,</hi> and Sir <hi>R—Bl—re,</hi> a Pair of twin Poets, who ſuck'd one and the ſame Muſe. After
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0076602000:28"/>
this he has a Fling at <hi>Handel, Bononcini</hi> and <hi>Attilio,</hi> the Opera Compoſers; and a ſevere Sneer on the late High-Church Idol, <hi>Sacheverel.</hi> As for <hi>Cluer,</hi> the Printer, any Body that knows Muſic, or <hi>Bow Church Yard,</hi> needs no farther Information.</p>
            <p>And now he proceeds to a Digreſſion, which is indeed the Diſſertation it ſelf; proving all Arts and Sciences to owe their Origin and Exiſtence to <hi>Pudding</hi> and <hi>Dumpling (i. e.)</hi> Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. His <hi>Hiatus</hi> in the 20th Page, I could, but dare not Decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</p>
            <p>In his 22d Page, he laſhes the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who oppoſe the Government; ſuch as the <hi>Craftſmain, Occaſional Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and other Scribblers, paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come. <hi>The Dumpling-Eaters Downfal,</hi> is a Title of his own Imagination; I have run over all <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s Catalogues, and ſee no Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of ſuch a Book: All that Paragraph therefore is a mere Piece of Rablaiſciſm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0076602000:29"/>
In his 23d Page, he has another confounded Fling at Foreigners; and after having determinately dubb'd his Hero, the Prince of Stateſmen, he concludes his Diſſertation with a Meſs of Drollery, and goes off in a Laugh.</p>
            <p>In a Word, the whole Diſſertation ſeems calculated to ingratiate the D—n in Sir **** Favour; he draws the Picture of an able and an honeſt Miniſter, painful in his Countries Service, and beloved by his Prince; yet oftentimes miſrepreſented and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd: Nay, ſometimes on the Brink of Ruin, but always Conqueror. The Fears, the Jealouſies, the Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of an enraged and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Party, give him no ſmall Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs to ſee the Ingratitude of ſome Men, the Folly of others, who ſhall believe black to be white, becauſe prejudiced and deſigning Knaves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm 'em with falſe Fears. We ſee every Action miſconſtrued, and Evil made out of Good; but as the beſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0076602000:30"/>
Perſons and Things are ſubject to Scandal and Ridicule; ſo have they the Pleaſure of Triumphing in the Truth, which always will prevail.</p>
            <p>I take the Allegory of this Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be partly Hiſtorical, partly Prophetical; the D—n ſeeming to have carried his View, not only to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but even, ſucceeding Times. He ſets his Hero down at laſt in Peace, Plenty, and a happy Retirement, not unrelented by his Prince; his Honeſty apparent, his Enemies baffled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and his Meaſures made the Standard of good Government; and a Pattern for all juſt Miniſters to follow.</p>
            <p>Thus, gentle Reader, have I, at the Expence of theſe poor Brains, crack'd this thick Shell, and given thee the Kernel. If any ſhould object, and ſay this Expoſition is a Contradiction to the D—n's Principles; I aſſure ſuch Objector, that the D—n is an errant <hi>Whig</hi> by Education, and Choice: He may indeed cajole the <hi>Tories</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0076602000:31"/>
with a Belief that he is of their Party; but it is all a Joke, he is a <hi>Whig,</hi> and I know him to be ſo; Nay more, I can prove it, and defy him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict me; did he not juſt after his Arrival and Promotion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> writing to one of his intimate Friends in <hi>London,</hi> conclude his Letter in this Manner?</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus Dear **** from all that has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, you muſt conclude me a</hi> Tory <hi>in every Thing, but my Principle, which is yet as unmoved, as, that I am,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>This Letter, his Tale of a Tub, and in a Word, all his Invectives againſt Enthuſiaſm and Prieſtcraft, plainly prove him to be no <hi>Tory;</hi> and if his Intimacy, not only with Sir **** himſelf, but moſt of the prime Men in the Miniſtry, cannot prove him a <hi>Whig,</hi> I have no more to ſay.</p>
