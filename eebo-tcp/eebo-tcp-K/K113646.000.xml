            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE TRAVELLER, OR A PROSPECT of SOCIETY. A POEM. INSCRIBED TO THE REV. MR. HENRY GOLDSMITH. BY OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M. B.</p>

            <head>TO THE REV. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM ſenſible that the friendſhip between us can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no new force from the ceremonies of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication; and perhaps it demands an excuſe thus to prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline giving with your own. But as a part of this Poem was formerly written to you from Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety, be only inſcribed to you. It will alſo throw a light upon many parts of it, when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der underſtands that it is addreſſed to a man, who, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing Fame and Fortune, has retired early to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Obſcurity, with an income of forty pounds a year.</p>
            <p>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wiſdom of your humble choice. You have entered upon a ſacred office, where the harveſt is great, and the labourers are but few;
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0429802300:4"/>
while you have left the field of Ambition, where the labourers are many, and the harveſt not worth carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away. But of all kinds of ambition, as things are now circumſtanced, perhaps that which purſues poetical fame, is the wildeſt. What from the encreaſed refinement of the times, from the diverſity of judgments produced by oppoſing ſyſtems of criticiſm, and from the more prevalent diviſions of opinion influenced by party, the ſtrongeſt and happieſt efforts can expect to pleaſe but in a very narrow circle. Though the poet were as ſure of his aim as the imperial archer of antiquity, who boaſted that he never miſſed the heart; yet would many of his ſhafts now fly at random, for the heart is too often in the wrong place.</p>
            <p>Poetry makes a principal amuſement among unpoliſhed nations; but in a country verging to the extremes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, Painting and Muſic come in for a ſhare. And as they offer the feeble mind a leſs laborious entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they at firſt rival Poetry, and at length ſupplant her; they engroſs all favour to themſelves, and though but younger ſiſters, ſeize upon the elder's birth-right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0429802300:5"/>Yet, however this art may be neglected by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, it is ſtill in greater danger from the miſtaken efforts of the learned to improve it. What criticiſms have we not heard of late in favour of blank verſe, and Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daric odes, choruſſes, anapeſts and iambics, alliterative care, and happy negligence. Every abſurdity has now a champion to defend it, and as he is generally much in the wrong, ſo he has always much to ſay.</p>
            <p>But there is an enemy to this art ſtill more dangerous, I mean party. Party entirely diſtorts the judgment, and deſtroys the taſte. A mind capable of reliſhing general beauty, when once infected with this diſeaſe, can only find pleaſure in what contributes to encreaſe the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Like the tyger, that ſeldom deſiſts from purſuing man after having once preyed upon human fleſh, the reader, who has once gratified his appetite with calumny, makes, ever after, the moſt agreeable feaſt upon mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered reputation. Such readers generally admire ſome half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold man, having loſt the character of a wiſe one. Him they dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify with the name of poet; his lampoons are called
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0429802300:6"/>
ſatires, his turbulence is ſaid to be force, and his phrenzy fire.</p>
            <p>What reception a Poem may find, which has neither abuſe, party, nor blank verſe to ſupport it, I cannot tell, nor am I much ſolicitous to know. My aims are right. Without eſpouſing the cauſe of any party, I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to moderate the rage of all. I have endeavoured to ſhew, that there may be equal happineſs in other ſtates, though differently governed from our own; that each ſtate has a peculiar principle of happineſs, and that this principle in each ſtate, and in our own in particular, may be carried to a miſchievous exceſs. There are few can judge, better than youſelf, How far theſe poſitions are illuſtrated in this Poem.</p>

               <l>Heavens! how unlike their Belgic ſires of old!</l>
               <l>Rough, poor, content, ungovernably bold;</l>
               <l>War in each breaſt, and freedom on each brow;</l>
