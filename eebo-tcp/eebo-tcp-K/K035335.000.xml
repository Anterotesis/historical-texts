            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>DEDICATION. TO SOAME JENYNS, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I lately read your Diſquiſition on Government and Civil Liberty, it gave me much concern to find, that you had not written it in verſe. Such images and ſuch ſentiments, ſuch wit and ſuch arguments, were ſurely too good to be waſted on proſe. And you who have written verſe ſo long, and with ſo much facility, are highly inexcuſable for not having employed that talent on ſo important an occaſion as the preſent, when you had taken upon you to confute <q rend="inline margQuotes">"ſo many abſurd principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning government and liberty, which have of <hi>late</hi> been diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with unuſual induſtry,"</q>principles, let, me add, which were ſtill more induſtriouſly diſſeminated at the Revolution by Locke, at the Acceſſion by Hoadly, and a hundred years before either, by Hooker; <q rend="margQuotes">"principles, which you ſay, are as falſe, as miſchievous, as inconſiſtent with common ſenſe, as with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſociety, and which require nothing more than to be fairly ſtated, to be refuted."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1118501200:5"/>
The pious poet, Herbert, I think tells us, that</p>
            <q>"A verſe may catch him, who a ſermon flies."</q>
            <p>Why then ſhould you diſcard verſe, when you intended to catch ſuch careleſs readers, as would be apt to fly a ſermon? Why, by dividing your diſcourſe into five methodical heads, ſhould you make it appear as formal as the graveſt pulpit-lecture ever deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by old biſhop Beveridge, or young Biſhop Bagot? I proteſt, Mr. Jenyns, I cannot account for this ſtrange proceeding.</p>
            <p>However, that ſuch ſort of readers may read you, I have attempted to do that for your benefit and theirs, which you would not do for them, or for yourſelf: and, unequal as I am to the taſk, have dreſt up your two firſt, and, as I think, principal topics, in as eaſy and faſhionable metre as I was capable of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. I know you would have done this much better. But, as my work is but a fragment, I am not without my hopes, that what I have done may be a ſpur to your indolence, and that you may be tempted not only to correct, but complete it.</p>
            <p>But when I ſay that I have verſified you, I take a pride in boaſting, that I am not your mere verſifier. I take a pleaſure too in owning, that you yourſelf led me to attempt a nobler ſpecies of compoſition. I had read, ſome years ago, your very delectable Eclogue of the 'Squire and the Parſon, written on occaſion of that glorious peace, the honour of making which, is to be inſcribed one day (may it be a late one!) on the mauſoleum of the Earl of Bute. This, Sir, led me to think of giving my preſent performance a dramatic caſt, ſo far as an eclogue can
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1118501200:6"/>
poſſeſs that title. On this idea, having reſolved to make you my TITYRUS, I had not far to ſeek for a MELIBAEUS. A bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writer, who has of late endeavoured to diſſeminate principles, ſimilar to ſome of yours, with unuſual, though abortive induſtry, immediately occurred to my imagination. And as immediately I reſolved to read his more elaborate treatiſe, in order to enable me to execute my plan with greater exactitude, and better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſentiment and character.</p>
            <p>Although I muſt own, that this exercitation of my patience coſt me many a yawn, yet I found, to my great ſatisfaction, that this writer allowed for true, what you hold to be falſe, thoſe two firſt principles of Mr. Locke, that men are equal, and that men are free <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Tucker on Government,</hi> ch. 1ſt.</note>. I concluded, therefore, that he was a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſon to diſpute thoſe points with you. Accordingly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther ceremonial, I ſet you both down, not indeed ſub tegmine fagi, but, for the ſake of the <hi>coſtumé,</hi> in a ſnug town coffee-houſe, and there entered you fairly into debate.</p>
            <p>If on your part, Sir, I have ever done more than elucidated any of thoſe aſſertions, which you call arguments, I humbly aſk your pardon: and on the Dean's, if <hi>I have made him a little too lively and ſpiritual,</hi> I as humbly aſk his. I know nothing does ſo much harm to an eccleſiaſtic, in the road of perferment, as the bare ſuſpicion of being witty. But, as the Divine in queſtion has long been a dean, and has ſworn that he will never be a biſhop, I hope no great harm is done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1118501200:7"/>
That you may long remain on the illuſtrious Liſt of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, even after the uſeful Board, from which you derive that right, ſhall be no more; that, having changed from Tory to Whig in the miniſtry of the Duke of Newcaſtle, from Whig to Tory under thoſe, or rather <hi>that</hi> of Lords Bute and North, you may now again change from Tory to Whig under the New Adminiſtration;—and (ſince we have it on very eloquent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it is now the faſhion for perſons of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to be <hi>no longer in ſhackles)</hi> that you may ſoon ceaſe to be encumbered with your preſent ſlaviſh principles, is the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and fervent wiſh of,</p>

               <l>He chanc'd to hitch into my rhyme—<note n="†" place="bottom">Had not this unlucky bolt been ſhot by the 'Squire, it is probable the Dean would not have been thrown off his ſcent, but would have anſwered all, that had been aſſerted, in ſome ſuch manner as Mr. Locke does: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Children, I confeſs, are not born in this full ſtate of <hi>equality,</hi> though they are born to it. Their parents have a ſort of rule and juriſdiction over them, when they come into the world, and for ſome time after; but it is but a temporary one. The bonds of this ſubjection are like the ſwaddling cloths they are wrapt up in, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by, in the weakneſs of their infancy: age and reaſon, as they grow up, looſen them, till at length they drop quite off, and leave a man at his own free diſpoſal".</q> 
                     <bibl>Ch. 6. ſec. 55.</bibl> This paſſage, and the other two already quoted, ſeem to be a ſufficient anſwer to Mr. Jenyns on his two firſt heads. All his objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions turn on the term <hi>born:</hi> whereas Locke's propoſitions are, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Men are by nature equal, and by nature free";</q> that is, have equal natural rights in their perſons and liberty.</note>

He ſuppoſes, that a hundred Adams and Eves ſhould all be produced full grown, and in <hi>conjugal pairs;</hi> and then concludes, that they would naturally herd together, and form a civil ſociety, from their inſtinctive love of living together as gregarious animals. But, as ſome might object that another inſtinctive appetite would ſpeedily diſturb the peace of this ſociety, and that Horace's <hi>tetrrima belli cauſa</hi> might make it a ſtate of war, he ſagely provides againſt this by noting, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that the appetite between the ſexes can have no place in the queſtion, becauſe it is not of that ſort, which renders mankind gregarious."</q> Yet, as he alſo owns, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that the moſt ſolitary animals at certain ſeaſons <hi>converſe</hi> in pairs",</q> it is neceſſary, for the ſupport of his hypotheſis, that all his Adams and Eves ſhould be as chaſte as turtles; and, therefore, I have called them a <hi>cool</hi> hundred, an epithet which, the reader ſees, is here far from being an exple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but highly emphatical; for, if the Dean's hundred Adams and Eves were not more <hi>cool</hi> than an hundred pairs of people of faſhion, whom I could mention, it is to be feared, that many of the males in his civil ſociety, would not only be <hi>gregarious animals,</hi> but abſolutely <hi>horned cattle.</hi> See Tucker on Government, p. 136.</note>
