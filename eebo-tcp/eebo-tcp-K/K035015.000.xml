            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Did not dare, ſo coldly was this Play received by the Town, to aſk Leave, in the uſual Forms, to dedicate it to your Lordſhip. Its Fate was early determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in ſuch a Manner, that I very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flatter myſelf, it can be worthy of your Lordſhip's Patronage, or may preſume to boaſt it was once honoured with your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. But as I may, probably, never have another Opportunity, certainly not in this Kind of writing, of publicly profeſſing my Reſpect, my Eſteem, I had almoſt ſaid, my Affection for your Lordſhip, may I not be forgiven, if I thus dedicate, not the Play, but its Author; not his Poetry, but his Underſtanding and his Heart?</p>
            <p>WITH Sentiments ſuch as theſe, I dare aſſure your Lordſhip, you ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the uſual, too civil, Language of Dedications. Yet I confeſs, I would gladly recover the Name of Dedications to its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Dignity, before they were proſtituted, moſt abſurdly proſtituted, by the Author of the <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> when he dedicated to a Tyrant a Poem in Defence of Liberty. I
<pb facs="tcp:0628600200:4"/>
confeſs, I mean to praiſe; for honeſt Praiſe is not only one of the warmeſt Incitements to Virtue, but its moſt honourable Reward. Great Minds will receive it with their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Greatneſs, and only little Spirits have an Affectation of refuſing it. The Taſk, I own, is not without Difficulty, but when the Original is marked with ſtrong and pleaſing Lines of Life, a meaner Hand may preſerve the Likeneſs. The Integrity of his Colouring, if I may be allowed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, is of more Conſequence, than the Glow and Richneſs of it. Dedications would then be like Pictures in Miniature, which the future Hiſtorian might draw out into larger Proportion, Grace, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>LET me then have the Honour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming your Lordſhip's Hiſtorian, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your Youth perhaps was ſpent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Pleaſures, not ill-ſuited to that gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Seaſon of Life (neque tu choreas ſperne, puer) yet it was not loſt among its too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſſipations. Ancient and modern Languages, with an accurate and critical Knowledge of the Engliſh Tongue, its Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Copiouſneſs, and Variety of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are not to be acquired without much Application. Nor could the greateſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Abilities, not even your own, my Lord, have appeared in the moſt important De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of the Houſe of Lords, with ſuch ſuperior Strength of Reaſoning, with Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence (in the true Character of Eloquence) at once pleaſing and powerful, had they not been improved by all Advantages of Education.</p>
            <p>TO ſuch Abilities were intruſted the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt of the Nation in Embaſſies abroad, and the moſt important Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Home. How happily for IRELAND was the Poſſeſſor of them ſent thither as Lord Lieutenant in that dangerous Criſis, the late Rebellion? One Part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the natural Enemies of his Majeſty's Government, were to be awed by Power, tempered with Lenity; the other were to be reſtrained in their Zeal of Loyalty, which though ſometimes ſhewn, perhaps, with too much Warmth, hath ever been their Glory and their Boaſt. How happily the Goodneſs of your Lordſhip's Heart was mixed with the Wiſdom of your Councils, the Gratitude of the whole People will for ever acknowledge. Long may you enjoy their Wiſhes, their Prayers for your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Long may you enjoy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of your own Integrity, that nobly

refuſed a Vote of Credit, and an Offer of raiſing a Body of Forces, which you wiſely foreſaw would be an uſeleſs Expence to the Kingdom. What muſt be the Firmneſs, and Generoſity of that Spirit, which is not to be ſeduced by Gold, intimidated by Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or corrupted by Views of enlarging its Power!</p>
            <p>YOUR Lordſhip now ſeems determined (and ſurely the gallant Veteran deſerves his Diſmiſſion) to retire from all public Buſineſs. Permit, my Lord, this honeſt Dedication, for well you know that Flattery would not deſire it, to attend you to your Retreat, and with it be pleaſed to accept the ſincereſt Reſpect of</p>
