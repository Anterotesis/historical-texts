            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Hiſtorian is an abſolute Stranger to moſt of the People of the preſent Age, therefore can never pretend to the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of ſatyrizing any Man, or any Body of Men.</p>
            <p>HE has had a Bundle of Papers left him by a deceas'd Friend, who was infinitely more capable of putting them in Form, than he can pretend to, tho' the Recluſeneſs of his Life afforded him abundant Leiſure. Theſe Papers contain'd a Variety of Obſervations, which, he thought, might be uſeful to Mankind. He has extended theſe Obſervations; he has, in ſome Meaſure, commented on them; he has dreſs'd them in the Garb of the Times; he has given them the Air of Romance, and he gives
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0558800101:5"/>
to the Reader, the abſolute Power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining whether he has done <hi>RIGHT</hi> or <hi>WRONG.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Hiſtorian has this Advantage over moſt others, and this only, That the Trifle he now preſents to the Publick, has a fair Chance of being impartially dealt with; for, as he is unknown, and will remain ſo, the critical Eye cannot condemn his Perſon, whatever it may his Work. His Scribbling may be abuſed, but he has taken Care to ſecure his Perſon from ſuch Treatment, tho' he is not conſcious that he has ever merited it.</p>
            <p>IRONY, well managed, has ever been a ſucceſsful Way to fix the Attention; and <hi>NOVEL</hi> and <hi>ROMANCE</hi> may be conducted to very laudable Purpoſes, and anſwer the End of more learned Writings. The Moral of the following Hiſtory may correſpond with an old phyſical Aphoriſm, which I apprehend may be found in the <hi>SCHOLA SALERNI,</hi> wrote in the Days of <hi>WILLIAM</hi> the Conqueror.</p>

Account of JOHN CONNOR.—I will not affirm that I have acted <hi>impartially,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will not preſume doing, what, I am afraid, no Hiſtorian <hi>ever did.</hi> If I aſſure my Readers I am quite <hi>unbias'd,</hi> yet I hope to be indulged, like the Reſt of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when I ſometimes act <hi>otherwiſe.</hi> I cannot avoid ſaying, I have conſulted the Eaſe of my Reader as much as poſſible, by not ſwelling this Work into <hi>Twenty Volumes.</hi> As a Proof of my Indulgence, I have ſhortened my Prefatory Diſcourſe and this Introduction above <hi>One Hundred Pages,</hi> and ſhall proceed directly to the Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH CONNOR, the Father of JOHN, whoſe Story I now write, had been a well made, athletic Man, and a Soldier in <hi>King</hi> WILLIAM'S Army in the War in <hi>Ireland.</hi> When that Matter was ſettled, he quitted that Sort of Life, and paſſing through ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Services, at laſt ſettled with Sir <hi>Roger Thornton,</hi> a Gentleman of great Honour and Fortune, in the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Here he lived, and his Warlike <hi>Scars of Credit,</hi> made him aſſume ſome Authority, and furniſhed a large Fund for Converſation. He found the Happineſs of being Virtuous in the <hi>Cauſe of Liberty</hi> and <hi>Common-Senſe.</hi> Though he was one of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0558800101:11"/>

Being himſelf a Man of <hi>Learning,</hi> he took ſome Pains to inculcate all his Knowledge, and taught her to <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Write.</hi> The Fame of her Erudition a little hightened her Vanity, eſpecially when <hi>Sir Roger</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined her himſelf, and declaring her a very ſurpriſing Genius, gave her a Kiſs and <hi>two Guineas</hi> to buy a Gown and Linnen.— This unfortunate Preſent, and a few more of the ſame Nature, at laſt alarm'd <hi>Lady Thornton,</hi> and brought on ſome Alteration, in which the Lady ſeem'd in the Right.

               <p>LADY THORNTON objected to this, but finding Sir <hi>Roger</hi> grow warm and ſomewhat peremptory, ſhe acquieſced.—Though <hi>Jerry Connor</hi> was thirty Years older than <hi>Dolly,</hi> they willingly conſented to the Match, and Peace was reſtor'd to the Family.</p>
               <p>THUS <hi>Jack</hi>'s Parents were fix'd in a Farm about twenty Miles from <hi>Thornton Caſtle. Jerry</hi> was Fifty-five and <hi>Dolly</hi> Twenty-four Years of Age. To compleat their Joy, the <hi>Hero of this Hiſtory</hi> ſtepp'd forth, and was uſher'd into the World the 15th Day of <hi>December</hi> 1720, juſt <hi>ſeven Months</hi> after their Nuptials, a fine healthy Boy, and the <hi>very</hi> Picture of <hi>Jerry Connor.</hi>

               <p>WHETHER it was from the <hi>frequent</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits Sir <hi>Roger</hi> paid them, or from ſome other Motive, my <hi>Lady Thornton</hi> never reſted till ſhe had perſuaded him to remove his Family to <hi>England.</hi> This was a mighty Loſs, and poor <hi>Connor</hi> felt it more and more every Day.

This ſhagrin'd Mrs. <hi>Connor,</hi> and her Huſband was ſometimes peeviſh. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Misfortune was imputed to <hi>one</hi> or the

               <p>AT laſt another Wound appear'd in <hi>his Head,</hi> and oblig'd him to have Recourſe to the Surgeon of the next Town, though ill able to bear the Expence of, at leaſt, <hi>a Shilling</hi> a Day.

               <p>THE <hi>Tranſition</hi> from an <hi>Iriſh Cottager</hi> to a <hi>Beggar,</hi> is very <hi>natural</hi> and common in the Country.

               <p>THE good People continued their daily Travels, and wander'd through many Counties, and greatly improv'd in the <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Myſtery,</hi> that was to furniſh them with Bread; and indeed, every Day produc'd its Supply. Three Months paſt in this Manner, till the <hi>old Man</hi> complain'd of the Fatigue, and moſt ardently wiſh'd for a ſettled Habitation. They were now in the great Road, and within a few Miles of <hi>Clonmel,</hi> on a pretty Eminence that commanded a good Proſpect. 'Twas agreed to fix here, and lodge about a Quarter of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0558800101:22"/>
a Mile from the Road; where was an <hi>old Hut,</hi> which a few Boughs cover'd well enough for the preſent.</p>
               <p>THE Venerableneſs of <hi>Jerry</hi>'s Beard, which no <hi>Razor</hi> was ſuffer'd to viſit, had a very good Effect, and the <hi>tatter'd</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Dolly</hi>'s Cloaths; Her <hi>Hair</hi> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about her <hi>Eyes,</hi> a <hi>dirty Clout</hi> on her Head, and <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> almoſt of the ſame Colour, made her look near <hi>as old</hi> as her <hi>Huſband,</hi> and procur'd the Charity of <hi>well diſpoſed Chriſtians</hi> ſo amply, that they had no Reaſon to repent of their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.—In a ſhort Time, the Hut was better cover'd; and they provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with <hi>two Cadows,</hi> a <hi>ſmall Pot, two wooden Platters, two Trenchers, one Knife,</hi> and <hi>two Horn Spoons.</hi> However, this Abode being ſo diſtant from what they might call <hi>their Shop,</hi> made it very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, and loſt them many <hi>Cuſtomers.</hi> This determin'd them to double Diligence, and to ſave as much as would build <hi>a Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> by the Road Side, on the <hi>Common.</hi> A few <hi>Shillings</hi> compleated this Structure, and their Effects were ſoon removed.</p>
               <p>THUS were they fix'd in a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Manner than could be imagined, from the Appearance of the <hi>Hovel.</hi> Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs went on in a very proſperous Way;

Father Kelly</hi> ſoon ſolv'd her Doubts; for as the <hi>Child</hi> ſtill continued at the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> he prais'd its <hi>Beauty,</hi> patted its <hi>Cheeks,</hi> and utter'd every <hi>infantine</hi> Expreſſion, which Mothers are ſo naturally fond to hear.—<q>The ſweet little Fellow, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> it looks like an Angel, I muſt <hi>kiſs it,</hi> were it but for the Sake of the Nurſe.</q>—He kept his Word; but guiding his <hi>Head</hi> a little more on <hi>one Side,</hi> he feaſted his Lips (as if by Accident) on <hi>thoſe Charms</hi> his Eyes had been Witneſs of for half an Hour.</p>
               <p>HIS Reverence recover'd himſelf at laſt, and—<q>I aſk your Pardon, good Mrs. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſaid he,</hi> for by my <hi>own Conſcience</hi> I had no Harm in my Thoughts; but God forgive me! in troth I was going to t'other Side, for fear it would be jealous; tho' if I had, you know, there would be no

                     <hi>Sin</hi> in it neither; for what is a <hi>Breaſt</hi> but <hi>Fleſh?</hi> and ſo is <hi>your Hand;</hi> and what <hi>Sin,</hi> my Dear, in touching a <hi>Hand?</hi>
                  </q> —This Reaſoning was ſo ſtrong that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction ſat on Mrs. <hi>Connor</hi>'s Countenance; which the <hi>good Man</hi> perceiving, he very fervently tranſported his <hi>Kiſſes</hi> from <hi>one Side</hi> to <hi>the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOME Travellers appearing, and <hi>Jerry</hi> being ſummon'd to his Poſt, the charitable <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſlipt Sixpence into her Hand, and gave the old Man a Yard of good Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co; ſo wiſhing them <hi>good Luck,</hi> added his <hi>Benediction,</hi> and promis'd to call in his Walks.</p>
               <p>IT would be endleſs to point out the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of this <hi>good Man.</hi> He viſited frequently, and always left <hi>ſomething</hi> behind him. He mention'd to <hi>Dolly</hi> the moſt charitable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in the Country; and taught <hi>Jerry</hi> how to tell the weary Traveller the <hi>Hour of the Day.</hi> He repair'd the <hi>firſt Hut,</hi> where ſhe always cook'd the Victuals when he <hi>honour'd</hi> them with his Company. He put a Door to it, and ſent in good Store of <hi>Whiſkey</hi> and <hi>Straw,</hi> with <hi>two Cadows.</hi> This ſerv'd <hi>his Reverence</hi> for a Country Retreat; and anſwered every End of a <hi>Confeſſional.</hi> His Converſation was <hi>truly pious,</hi> and his Pains were great to convert <hi>Jerry</hi> to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0558800101:27"/>
                  <hi>Boſom of that Church,</hi> out of which there is <hi>no Salvation.</hi> Sometimes, indeed, his <hi>Zeal</hi> was rather too great; for when Mr. <hi>Connor</hi> made ſtrong Objections, he <hi>moſt charitably,</hi> and with a <hi>truly Chriſtian Spirit,</hi> hurry'd poor <hi>Jerry</hi>'s Soul <hi>to the Devil and all his Angels;</hi> in which Journey his Wife always added an hearty <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ABOUT the Age of Five Years, JACK remembers his daily ſitting on a Ditch with his <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> induſtriouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that <hi>moſt antient</hi> and <hi>moſt noble</hi> Profeſſion of <hi>Begging.</hi> The Situation was well contriv'd, and three Roads terminated juſt at their Manſion, and, as it were, empty'd themſelves into the <hi>great one.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Beauty of the Proſpect, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, <hi>his Parents</hi> had ſome <hi>Regard</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to Society; for no Traveller could paſs, but were attack'd with all the <hi>Oratory</hi> in their Power. Without Vanity I may ſay, few People of <hi>their Diſtinction</hi> enjoy'd that <hi>Talent</hi> to greater Perfection, eſpecially Mrs. <hi>Connor.</hi> When ſhe was determin'd to <hi>extract</hi> a <hi>Penny</hi> from a <hi>good Chriſtian,</hi> ſhe mounted the Ditch, and with Eyes rais'd to Heaven, and uplifted Hands, ſhe beſpoke his Favour: She ſaluted him with every <hi>tender, moving</hi> Expreſſion. The <hi>Tear</hi> was ready; and ſometimes ſhe pleaded a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0558800101:28"/>
                  <hi>numerous Family of Orphans,</hi> and ſometimes an <hi>antient helpleſs Huſband.</hi>— Did his <hi>hard Heart</hi> paſs by <hi>untouch'd,</hi> ſhe followed him with her rais'd Voice, invoking every <hi>Saint</hi> to proſper his Journey, and to commiſerate her <hi>wretched Condition.</hi>—Many a Time, and oft', has ſhe compelled the moſt <hi>obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Lawyer</hi> or <hi>Parſon</hi> to <hi>Rein-back,</hi> and fumble for <hi>Farthings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JERRY had his Excellence: He was really advanced in Years; was infirm and <hi>blind.</hi> The Loſs of Sight, ſo dreadful to many, was to them of infinite Uſe. From this he drew the <hi>Pity</hi> of the <hi>Good-natur'd,</hi> and the <hi>Compaſſion</hi> of moſt Travellers; but his being an <hi>old Soldier who had ſerv'd by Sea and Land,</hi> afforded an Addition to his <hi>Revenue;</hi> to which a <hi>red Coat</hi> contributed not a little.</p>
               <p>YOUNG as our <hi>Hero</hi> was, his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had its Uſe; for whilſt his dear Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were ſolacing themſelves in <hi>their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> and enjoying the Comforts of <hi>Ale, Tobacco,</hi> and the Converſation of <hi>Friends,</hi> he was on the Watch for the Approach of Paſſengers; when his <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>both,</hi> ſally'd out, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended to join in the <hi>Cry</hi> and pick up the <hi>Copper</hi> that Humanity threw them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0558800101:29"/>JACK now grew a ſturdy Fellow, of Six Years old. As his Mother had been ſo good to teach him to <hi>read,</hi> he was a great Comfort to his <hi>Father,</hi> and entertained him out of <hi>The whole Duty of Man,</hi> which he took particular Care of, ever ſince Mrs. <hi>Connor</hi> had ſold his <hi>Bible.</hi> The Child read ſo frequently, that at laſt he was very <hi>expert,</hi> and began to reliſh the Subject. One Day, he aſked his Father, <hi>If there was any more Books in the World, for he would read them all.</hi> 
                  <q>God bleſs you, poor Child, <hi>ſaid Jerry,</hi> and give you <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>learn,</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> all good Things.</q>—Then, fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in his Arms, with many Tears, and uplifted Hands, beſeech'd the <hi>Almighty</hi> to ſuccour his helpleſs <hi>Age,</hi> and guide his Steps, that he might live by <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>—Though <hi>Jack</hi> knew not what he meant, yet his Words made ſo great an Impreſſion, that he <hi>cry'd</hi> moſt heartily.— In this Situation the Mother found them, which ſoon changed the Scene: She ſtorm'd like a Fury, and ſwore he was ſending the Boy to the Devil, as well as himſelf; <q>But, <hi>continued ſhe,</hi> with all my Heart, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Baſtard as he is; but I'll take Care, I warrant, of your <hi>damn'd Book.</hi>
                  </q>—She then <hi>curs'd herſelf</hi> moſt bitterly, for teaching
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0558800101:30"/>
                  <hi>Jack</hi> to <hi>read;</hi> and mutter'd ſomething of <hi>ſending him far enough out of his Reach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>No, <hi>Dolly, ſaid her Huſband,</hi> you need not do that; for <hi>Father Kelly</hi> and <hi>You</hi> will ſoon ſend me to my <hi>long Home!</hi>—'Tis too good News to be true,—<hi>ſaid ſhe.</hi>—Well, well, <hi>reply'd Jerry,</hi> I ſhan't trouble you long;— you may let me have a little Peace whilſt I live.</q>—Some Paſſengers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted this Converſation; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Occurrences of the Day, gave <hi>Jerry</hi> ſome Reſpite till Dinner.—He ſaid <hi>Grace</hi> as uſual, but could not eat. At Supper 'twas the ſame Way; and in the Night a <hi>Fever</hi> came on which open'd his Wounds, and, for Want of <hi>proper Care,</hi> a <hi>Mortification</hi> enſued, and the fourth Day <hi>he ſlept with his Fathers.</hi>—The pious <hi>Prieſt</hi> was determined to have the better of the <hi>Argument</hi> at laſt, and make him a good <hi>Catholick,</hi> by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the final <hi>Rites of the Church,</hi> before the <hi>Body</hi> was <hi>quite cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ON this melancholy Occaſion, it muſt be confeſſed, the poor Widow behav'd as the moſt faſhionable of her Sex.—She <hi>ſhrieked</hi> and <hi>wrung her Hands,</hi> and call'd on <hi>Death</hi> to eaſe her <hi>Miſery.</hi>—She <hi>fainted,</hi> and fell into <hi>Fits;</hi> and the Neighbours with great Difficulty brought her to herſelf.— When recover'd, ſhe bore her <hi>Fate</hi> with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0558800101:31"/>
great <hi>Reſignation,</hi> and gave Directions about the <hi>Funeral</hi> with much Compoſure of Mind, except when more Friends dropt in, which renewed her <hi>Sorrows;</hi> and then the whole Company ſympathiz'd in the <hi>moſt doleful Cadences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Deceaſed being ſtripped and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was laid out on ſome <hi>Straw,</hi> cover'd with a Sheet that was formerly white. On his <hi>Breaſt</hi> was a large Diſh fill'd with Salt, which undoubtedly had its Uſe. The good People, three Miles round, flock'd to <hi>blind Connor's Wake,</hi> with Loads of <hi>Whiſkey</hi> and <hi>Tobacco; Pipers</hi> were in Abundance; and ſundry <hi>Gentlemen</hi> amuſed the Company with the <hi>ſweet Harmony</hi> of their <hi>Trumps</hi> or <hi>Jews-harps.</hi>—When <hi>Father Kelly</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that <hi>Jerry Connor</hi> died a <hi>True Son of the Church,</hi> being by him converted almoſt by a <hi>Miracle,</hi> a <hi>Buzz</hi> of Content ran thro' the whole Aſſembly, and he finiſhed a few Prayers for the <hi>Repoſe of his Soul.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>common Iriſh</hi> are chearful at a <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</hi> but, at a <hi>Wake,</hi> their <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Mirth</hi> is ſeemingly <hi>extravagant.

               <p>MIRTH in every Shape abounded; but <hi>Jack</hi> ſeem'd to drop all the romping Sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

Some hinted, that <hi>Dolly</hi> was not <hi>his Wife;</hi> ſome called her his <hi>Niece,</hi> and ſome his <hi>Daughter;</hi> but <hi>all</hi> agreed, in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, what he Devil <hi>Father Kelly</hi> could ſee, to make him ſo <hi>civil to her.</hi>—I much fear many grand Societies are but <hi>humble</hi> Imitators of this <hi>equally polite</hi> Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>AT laſt the <hi>Funeral</hi> ſet out, directing their Courſe to a <hi>ruin'd Monaſtery,</hi> about Six Miles diſtant. The March was ſolemn; and ever and anon a <hi>Sacred Dirge</hi> was rais'd, that ſhook the <hi>Hills,</hi> and eccho'd through the <hi>Vales.</hi> The Company ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd from the neighbouring Cabins, whoſe Inhabitants having walked two or three Miles, and rais'd their <hi>Notes</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence

               <p>MRS. CONNOR had converted the old <hi>red Coat</hi> into a Sort of Waiſtcoat for <hi>Jack,</hi> who having a Pocket, never failed carrying his <hi>Book</hi> in it.

Aunt.</q>—Poor <hi>Jack</hi> was vaſtly pleas'd at going to Town, though he knew not where, and followed his <hi>Mother</hi> with great Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.

Some Queſtions being aſk'd, <q>I am going, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> to leave <hi>Jack</hi> at my <hi>Siſter</hi>'s for a Day or two, and muſt be back to <hi>Squire Diſney</hi>'s to Night. —That's too far, <hi>ſaid the Man,</hi> to walk in one Day; go you to the <hi>Squire</hi>'s, and I ſhall take care of <hi>Jack.</hi>

               <p>NOTHING remarkable happened in this Journey, but <hi>Jack</hi> complain'd that the <hi>Town</hi> was a great ways off.—That he wiſh'd he was there;—that he was <hi>Hungry,</hi> or <hi>Dry,</hi> or <hi>Sleepy,</hi> and ſome childiſh Talk of that Sort, to which the Man gave Anſwers, and relieved all his Wants.—Many Days paſſed in ſmall Journeys, till the Fellow found he was in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Meath.</hi> He fed the Child as well as he could, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got a Woman to waſh his Rags and clean him, march'd on till he came to a large fine Houſe.—<q>Now, <hi>Jack, ſaid he,</hi>

               <p>THE poor Child waited a long Time for him with great Patience, till <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> coming on, he <hi>cry'd</hi> till his little Heart was almoſt broke.—At laſt he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to walk to the Gate, and found it open. He went into a large Court-yard, and finding a Houſe, which was a deſerted <hi>Dog-kennel,</hi> he boldly enter'd; and what with his Fatigues, and little Sorrows, he lay down and <hi>ſlept</hi> ſoundly 'till next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—One of the <hi>Grooms</hi> going by, heard the Cries of the Boy, and relieved him from his Priſon.—He was aſk'd many Queſtions, to which he could give no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; except that a Man was going with him to his <hi>Aunt</hi>'s, and that his Name was <hi>Jack Connor.</hi>—The Groom aſk'd him <q>if he was <hi>hungry?</hi> Yes, ſaid <hi>Jack,</hi> and very <hi>dry</hi> too, and my <hi>Feet</hi> are very <hi>ſore.</hi>
                  </q>— The Servant was good natur'd, and taking him into one of the Stables, gave him a Piece of Bread and ſome ſmall Beer. He waſh'd his little Feet with warm <hi>Brand and Water,</hi> which was ready to be given to a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0558800101:39"/>
                  <hi>ſick Horſe,</hi> and laid him on ſome clean Straw. The poor Child went to Sleep, but waken'd ſo refreſh'd, and ſo happy, that, on ſeeing the Groom, he <hi>ſmil'd,</hi> and utter'd every Expreſſion, that ſhew'd the <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of his Heart.</p>
               <p>THUS was he fed for a Fortnight, and all Enquiry was made by the Servants about him, but in vain.—<hi>Jack</hi> grew quite well, and mightily pleas'd with his Situation, for <hi>Providence</hi> had directed him to the Houſe of LORD TRUEGOOD, a Nobleman leſs remarkable for his <hi>large Fortune,</hi> than his <hi>Humanity,</hi> and extenſive <hi>Charity</hi> to all Mankind.</p>
               <p>MR. KINDLY, his Lordſhip's Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Steward, had heard ſomething of this Story, and determined to ſee the Child.— He watch'd when the Servants were out, and ſtole privately into the <hi>Stable.—Jack</hi> was mounted in one of the Windows, with his <hi>Book</hi> in his Hand, but when he ſaw the Gentleman, he ſtuff'd it into his Pocket, and got on his Feet in an Inſtant. Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> with a Smile of good Nature, cry'd out—'Who have we got here?—Where did you come from, Child?'—'Indeed, Sir, <hi>reply'd Jack, almoſt in Tears,</hi> I don't know.'—'Don't <hi>cry,</hi> my Dear, <hi>ſaid the good Steward,</hi> I ſhall do you no Harm;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0558800101:40"/>
—Have you a <hi>Mother,</hi> and where is ſhe gone to?—I don't know indeed Sir, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd Jack,</hi> but ſhe gave me to a Man to ſee my Aunt, and he bid me ſtay at the Gate, and ſo I did, and ſo he did'nt come for me.'—'That's my good Boy, <hi>ſaid Kindly;</hi> come, now tell me all the reſt.'—The poor Child was not at a Loſs, but told as much of his Affairs as he poſſibly could know, and in ſo innocent a Manner, that greatly pleas'd the good Man. —<q>That's my good Dear, <hi>ſaid he;</hi> but what <hi>Book</hi> was it, you put in your Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket? Let me ſee it my Man.</q>—<hi>Jack</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd it, telling him, <hi>his Father ſaid it was a good Book, and would make every Body good.</hi>—Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> look'd at the Title, and was greatly ſurpriz'd.—'Your Father, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> was a good Man, and you'll be a very <hi>good Boy,</hi> when you can read it.'— Oh dear, <hi>ſaid Jack,</hi> indeed, Sir, I can read it very well.'—'Can you ſo, <hi>reply'd the Steward,</hi> let me ſee.'—He opened the Book, where leaſt mark'd, and <hi>Jack</hi> began, and pretty diſtinctly read.—<q>So alſo for the Calamities and Miſeries that befall a Man, be it Want or Sickneſs, or whatever elſe, theſe alſo come by the Providence of God, who raiſeth up and putteth down, as ſeems good to him, and it belongs not to us
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0558800101:41"/>
to judge what are the Motives to him to do ſo, as many do, who, upon any Affliction that befalls another, are preſently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that ſure it was ſome extraordinary Guilt, which puts this upon him, though they have no particular to lay to his Charge.</q>—As the Boy read, the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of the <hi>good Man</hi> mounted to his Eyes.—<q>That's enough my Child, <hi>ſaid he,</hi>—God bleſs you.</q>—So quitting him in an Inſtant, got into the Yard, and gave vent to a few Tears.—Good God, <hi>cry'd he,</hi> how infinitely is thy loving Kindneſs, who, out of the Mouths of <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings,</hi> teacheth us our <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MR. KINDLY walked to the Houſe, and having call'd Mrs. <hi>Mathews,</hi> an elderly Servant, begg'd her to get him a Leg or a Wing of a Fowl, with a Piece of Bread, and ſome ſmall Beer. 'Lord, dear Sir, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mathews,</hi> may hap your Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's Walk has <hi>gotten</hi> you a Stomach; pray let me broil you a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> and give you a Glaſs of <hi>white Wine.</hi>'—'Thank you heartily, good Mrs. <hi>Mathews, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Steward,</hi> you know I ſeldom eat in a Morning, but I never <hi>drink.</hi> What I want is for a poor Stranger.'— Lord bleſs you, dear Sir, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mrs. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews,</hi> you are ſo good, all the Servants
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0558800101:42"/>
are bound to <hi>pray for you.'</hi>—She did not wait for a Reply, but ran to the Pantry, and ſoon returned, properly loaded. — 'Thank you, my dear Friend, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> now I have a great Favour to beg of you; which is, to carry theſe to the fartheſt Stable, where you'll find a poor <hi>little Boy.</hi> See him eat his Dinner, and take him to <hi>John Long</hi>'s Wife.'—'Yes that I will, <hi>ſaid ſhe.</hi>'—'The Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your good Heart.—I'm ſure you're always the <hi>poor Man</hi>'s Friend. — The Lord keep you your Health, for you're too good for <hi>this World.</hi>'—'We muſt aſſiſt one another, <hi>ſaid Kindly,</hi> but pray go and help the Child, and I'll walk on to <hi>John Long</hi>'s.'</p>
               <p>MRS. MATHEWS thought there was ſome <hi>Myſtery</hi> in this Affair, but reſolved to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>ſee,</hi> but ſay nothing. She determined to be as <hi>ſecret</hi> as could be expected from her <hi>Sex</hi> and <hi>Station;</hi> ſo, wiſely took <hi>Jenny</hi> the Houſe Maid to the Stable, to whom ſhe communicated the Matter, with many notable Remarks.—<q>You know, <hi>Jenny, ſaid ſhe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> is a Man as well as another, and though he is <hi>antient</hi> or <hi>ſo,</hi> yet, let me tell you, 'tis an <hi>old Rat</hi> that won't <hi>eat Cheeſe.</hi>—He's a hearty Man, <hi>Jenny,</hi> and a good natur'd Man, and they

ſay lives a Widower for the Sake of his Children; now putting <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> together, who knows what may have happen'd?—But <hi>pleaſe</hi> God it ſhall go no farther for me;'—nor for me neither, <hi>ſaid Jenny,</hi> for I would not hurt a Hair of his Head, <hi>poor dear Man.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THEY got to the Stable and found <hi>Jack</hi> with the Groom.—So ſo, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mrs. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews,</hi> have I found you, young Spark.— 'Come, ſit down my little fellow, and try how a bit will agree with you.'—'What <hi>Jenny, ſaid the Groom,</hi> are you come too? I'll ſay that for you, you've as good a Noſe at finding out a <hi>pretty Boy,</hi> as any Wench in the Pariſh; I ſuppoſe he's ſome Relation of your's, <hi>Eh, Jenny?</hi>— The Fellow's a Fool, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mathews,</hi> tho' may hap he may have as good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as any here.—Come, my brave Man, eat heartily, and much good may do you.—So—you ſay your Name is <hi>Jack,</hi>—'Yes, Madam, <hi>ſaid the Child,</hi> my Name is <hi>Jack Connor.</hi>—Very well, <hi>ſaid the good Woman,</hi> very well; now come, my dear, and take a Walk with me, we'll not go far, only to <hi>John Long's.'</hi> —Then turning to the Groom, ſaid, with a Wink, <q>Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> bid me fill his little Belly, and carry him to <hi>John</hi>'s Wife.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0558800101:44"/>THE Groom was pleas'd, and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> marched on.—<hi>'Jenny, ſaid</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mathews,</hi> look at the little Fellow, how ſturdily he walks, and for all the World, like good Mr. <hi>Kindly.</hi> 'Faith and troth, ſaid <hi>Jenny,</hi> and ſo he does, and his Name is <hi>Jack</hi> too.' 'Faith, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mathews,</hi> I forgot that, and then the little Rogue has the <hi>very</hi> Smile of him.—Now I think on it <hi>Jenny,</hi> I'll be hang'd but I knew the Mother of him. Do you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Bryan Connor</hi> the Miller, that lived at the Ford two Miles off.'—'Yes that I do, <hi>reply'd Jenny,</hi> and <hi>by the ſame Token,</hi> he had four Daughters and three Sons.'— Very true, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mrs. <hi>Methews,</hi> and all the Neighbours believed Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> was a great Help to the Family, for he went very often there. The old People died, and the Children went up and down, I don't know what became of them all; but <hi>Molly Connor</hi> was a <hi>pretty Huſſey enough,</hi> but was <hi>no better</hi> than ſhe <hi>ſhould be,</hi> and about ſeven or eight Years agon, ſhe contriv'd to get her <hi>Belly up,</hi> and then went to <hi>Dublin.</hi>'—'Goodneſs Sirs, <hi>ſaid Jenny,</hi> how ſtrangely Things <hi>comes</hi> about; ſo, to be ſure this is her Child.' Ay, ay, <hi>ſaid Mathews,</hi> as ſure as <hi>I'm in this Spot alive.</hi> Murder will out, you know,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0558800101:45"/>
but that's none of our Buſineſs,—we are only Servants, and muſt hold our Tongues; ſo, beſure <hi>Jenny, ſaid ſhe,</hi> don't open your Lips about it, for it ſhan't be <hi>computed</hi> to me, for I hate <hi>fending</hi> and <hi>proving,</hi> and wou'd'nt be brought into a <hi>Primeiniron</hi> for all I'm <hi>worth in the World.'</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Steward and Mrs. <hi>Long</hi> were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Door till <hi>Jack</hi> arrived.— <q>There, Madam <hi>Long, ſaid</hi> Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> There's a Boy for you; don't you think him very like me? Heaven knows, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd</hi> Mrs. <hi>Long,</hi> for the poor little Face of him is ſo dirty, 'tis impoſſible to tell who he is like; but pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> I'll know more of him by To-morrow! Do ſo, <hi>ſaid Kindly,</hi> and in a little Time I hope to ſee him look as well as <hi>my own Son.</hi>— Then turning to Mrs. <hi>Mathews,</hi> thank'd her for her Civilities, and promis'd her a Preſent of ſome good <hi>Bohea Tea.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Ladies made great haſte Home, and by Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi>'s Words, they were more confirm'd in their firſt Conjectures, and in the Neceſſity of being <hi>very Secret.</hi>— No doubt they were mighty cautious, but on Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi>'s Return to <hi>Bounty-Hall,</hi> he found a ſtrange Alteration in the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Servants.—When he ſpoke,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0558800101:46"/>
he was anſwer'd with a <hi>Smile</hi> or a <hi>Grin.</hi>— A general <hi>Titter</hi> and <hi>Whiſper</hi> ran through the Family, and on his Enquiry into the Cauſe of ſo much Mirth, they vaniſh'd with a loud Laugh.—Though a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at their Behaviour, he knew there was no Miſchief done, ſo was perfectly eaſy. He always permitted them to be as chearful as they pleas'd, for he thought an <hi>Openneſs</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> of Manners, was an Indication of an <hi>honeſt Heart;</hi> but he ever ſuſpected a Servant of a <hi>gloomy</hi> or <hi>ſullen</hi> Countenance.</p>

               <p>AS the Reader muſt reſide with <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady Truegood</hi> for ſome Time, perhaps they will be pleas'd at being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly acquainted with them. To thoſe who know not their Perſons, I can only introduce them to their <hi>Perſonal Conduct,</hi> and <hi>Family Behaviour.</hi> This may be as uſeful and entertaining, and rather leſs te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, than a Deſcription of their <hi>Features,</hi> their <hi>Stature,</hi> or other viſible Marks of <hi>Elegance, Beauty,</hi> or <hi>Deformity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0558800101:54"/>HIS <hi>Lordſhip</hi> had about Five Thouſand a Year in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and about Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in <hi>England,</hi> all in his own Power. Her <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> was the Daughter of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Templeton,</hi> of <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi> She was Heireſs to Two Thouſand Pounds a Year in that County; and his <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Eſtate lay contiguous to it. Miſs <hi>Templeton</hi> was endow'd with all thoſe Charms that <hi>Men of Senſe</hi> admire, becauſe they know they are <hi>laſting.</hi> Her <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> had that Sort of ſprightly and ſolid Turn, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven'd, at the ſame Time, it pleas'd and improv'd her Hearers. Her many Virtues were more admir'd than imitated; and her Perſon, tho' not a <hi>Beauty,</hi> was ſo genteel and <hi>elegantly neat,</hi> that ſhe rais'd <hi>Deſire</hi> in every Breaſt, and commanded more than common Reſpect. They had been well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted when Children; and from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy of each Family, a Friendſhip, if not ſomething ſtronger, inſenſibly grew up with them. His Collegiate Studies being over, and his Father dead, he was ſent to finiſh the Accompliſhments of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by <hi>Travel.</hi> In this Time he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſponded with Miſs <hi>Betty Templeton,</hi> and the moſt agreeable and entertaining Letters paſs'd, greatly to their Satisfaction and mutual Improvement. Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0558800101:55"/>
a Clergyman, and his Lordſhip's Tutor and Companion, vaſtly encourag'd theſe good Diſpoſitions in his Pupil, foreſeeing the <hi>happy</hi> Conſequences that might ariſe from it.</p>
               <p>AT Twenty-four Years of Age, <hi>his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> return'd from his Travels, a <hi>truly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> and <hi>well-bred Man.</hi>—He found Miſs <hi>Templeton,</hi> now about Nineteen Years of Age, with every Qualification he could wiſh in a <hi>Wife.</hi>—He ſpoke to her, at ſome Diſtance, on that Head, and found her Anſwers ſenſible and juſt, and no-ways againſt his Views.—His <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> then, apply'd to Mrs. <hi>Jordon,</hi> a Widow Lady, and Aunt to Miſs, who had bred her from a Child, and ſupply'd the Loſs of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The good Lady was overjoy'd to put her dear Niece into the Hands of a Nobleman of ſuch Fortune; and whoſe great Good-nature, and many Virtues, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd a Life of real Happineſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>HIS Lordſhip now paid his Addreſſes publickly; every one agreeing, they were born for each other.—A Jointure was ſoon fix'd on; but the Settling his Eſtate was a Matter of ſome Difficulty, as his Notions on that Head were uncommon.—He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought, that the Undutifulneſs of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0558800101:56"/>
Children to their Parents, eſpecially of the <hi>Eldeſt Son,</hi> proceeded often from a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Fortune they were entitled to, at their Father's Deceaſe.—His Lordſhip convinced the young Lady of the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of placing Children out of the Power of Parents, either to <hi>reward</hi> ſome for their Goodneſs, or <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> others for their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds. At laſt he perſwaded her Guardians, and Four Thouſand Pounds a Year was ſettled on the Iſſue of the Marriage, in ſuch Proportion, as my Lord thought proper to make by Will, or any future Deed or Gift, except an Eſtate of Five Hundred Pounds a Year, which ſhould follow the Title: Two Thouſand Pounds a Year, and Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds in Money, was ſettled on Miſs <hi>Templeton;</hi> and my Lord reſerv'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder as a Settlement on any future Wife, or to be diſpoſed of, as he thought proper. —The young Lady was ſo weak, that ſhe abſolutely inſiſted, that <hi>Pin,</hi> or <hi>Alimony,</hi> ſhould not be mentioned in any of the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.—All theſe Matters being regularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted, the Day was fix'd, and Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> joyn'd their Hands, and compleated the Happineſs of this truly affectionate Pair.</p>
               <p>MY Lord and Lady ſtay'd above Two Years in <hi>England;</hi> but finding his Preſence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0558800101:57"/>
quite neceſſary in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſettle his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which had ſomewhat ſuffer'd by the Death of his Father, and his own long Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he haſten'd over, and determin'd chiefly to reſide there.—He took with him his two Sons, <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> with my Lady's Aunt, Mrs. <hi>Jordon,</hi> and a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Retinue of Servants.—Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> had been already there Twelve Months, and ſettled in a good Living, which my Lord had procured him.</p>
               <p>BOUNTY-HALL, the Seat of Lord <hi>True-good,</hi> was a regular, well-built Houſe, tho' not altogether in the <hi>Modern Taſte.</hi>—The Company, to congratulate my Lord and Lady on their ſafe Arrival, was very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and very gay. They ſeem'd free, and of chearful Diſpoſitions, inviting my Lord and Family to their Houſes, in ſuch an hearty ſincere Manner, as quite pleas'd and ſurpriz'd my Lady and Mrs. <hi>Jordon,</hi> who were not a little <hi>prejudiced</hi> againſt the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> —Mrs. <hi>Jordon</hi> could not avoid telling my Lord, ſhe <hi>lik'd them extreamly, but wiſh'd they'd ſpeak with another Tone of Voice.</hi>— My Lord laugh'd, and ſaid, <q>I aſſure you, one of the Ladies ask'd me, if all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpoke in ſo ſtrange a Manner as Mrs. <hi>Jordon?</hi> But ſhe added, ſhe believ'd you were a very good Lady, for all that.</q>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0558800101:58"/>
—My Lady and her Aunt ſmil'd, and took this tender Rebuke in the proper Manner; acknowledging, that <hi>Infant Prejudices</hi> were difficult to remove, but hoped, Time would get the better of ſome of them.</p>
               <p>MRS. JORDON took great Pains to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Pronunciation of the People. She made ſuch Progreſs in tranſplanting the <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Dialect, that on her Return to that County, ſhe was heartily laugh'd at, and by her Friends was conſtantly called an <hi>Iriſh Bog-Trotter,—a Brogue-a-neer,—a Teague,</hi> and ſundry other <hi>endearing</hi> Names. —But I muſt follow my Lord.</p>
               <p>HIS firſt Care was to get out of the Hands of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> for he had three <hi>Chancery Suits:</hi> Two of them he ſoon finiſhed in an amicable Manner, but the Third was ſo glaring an Affront on his Underſtanding and his Right, that he would hear of no Compoſition, leſt he might be tax'd with <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> and draw on himſelf <hi>others.</hi>— This determin'd him to proſecute the Suit with the utmoſt Vigour; and the <hi>Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> was ſuch, that the Cauſe was ripe for an Hearing, juſt as my Lord— <hi>became a Grandfather.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHILST his Law Affairs were put in a Channel, he at the ſame Time ſettled with his different <hi>Receivers,</hi> two of whom he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0558800101:59"/>
diſcharged, as likewiſe his <hi>Auditor,</hi> taking that Branch into his own Management. He oblig'd his Receivers to return him Monthly Abſtracts of their Receipts and Payments, by which he was enabled to ſettle each Tenant's Account, and at <hi>one View,</hi> knew their Arrear, and gave Orders for <hi>Severity</hi> or <hi>Indulgence,</hi> as the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances required.</p>
               <p>As my Lord's chief Reſidence was in the Country, he ſaw, with real Uneaſineſs, the <hi>wretched Condition</hi> of the poor Inhabitants. Their <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and <hi>Sloth,</hi> with the Swarms of <hi>ignorant Prieſts,</hi> and the Treatment of <hi>ſome Landlords,</hi> kept them in a conſtant <hi>miſerable</hi> Situation, and even depriv'd them of ſufficient Spirits to <hi>wiſh</hi> a Change of Condition. My Lord clearly ſaw, that ſuch Diſpoſitions could never improve the Face of the Country. He conſidered, that the People, however <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>miſerable,</hi> were by Nature, ſtrong; and, when ſet on by Example and Encouragement, were not the <hi>leaſt Docile</hi> of all Nations. Theſe Sort of Reflections, as a faithful and good Subject, engroſſed his whole Thoughts. He knew, that the Strength of the Crown, was in the Number of faithful Inhabitants; and, to reclaim thoſe who were otherwiſe, was a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0558800101:60"/>
Duty worthy the Attention of every Man who lov'd the <hi>King</hi> or his <hi>own Happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT a Meeting of the Juſtices of the Peace for the County, his Lordſhip very patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally laid before them, what <hi>Popery</hi> was productive of, in a <hi>Proteſtant Government;</hi> or, as it is elegantly expreſs'd by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Genius of the Age,<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>EARL</hi> of <hi>CHESTERFIELD'S</hi> Speech to the <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi> of <hi>IRELAND.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <q>That the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Errors <hi>(of POPERY)</hi> would only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Pity, if their pernicious Influence upon <hi>CIVIL SOCIETY</hi> did not both <hi>REQUIRE</hi> and <hi>AUTHORIZE</hi> Reſtraint.</q> That the <hi>Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> tho' ſevere in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and tho' moſtly taken from the <hi>Edicts of France</hi> againſt <hi>Hugonots,</hi> but greatly ſoften'd, were connived at, and, in a great Meaſure, made uſeleſs.—That the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poorer Sort in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was a <hi>Scandal</hi> to a Nation who piqued themſelves at being <hi>Polite</hi> and <hi>Humane,</hi> and almoſt compell'd the <hi>few Strangers</hi> who viſited the Country, to imagine they were rather with the Natives of the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> than in a <hi>civilized Kingdom.</hi>—That as natural Juſtice and Tenderneſs obliged us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them with a <hi>Prieſt</hi> in each Pariſh; yet Juſtice and Tenderneſs to ourſelves,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0558800101:61"/>
ought to oblige us to proſecute every <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loper</hi> who attempted to officiate.—He added, that he was ſo convinced of the Neceſſity of it, he was determin'd to begin in his own Diſtrict, and wiſh'd every one preſent would concur with him.</p>
               <p>MANY Debates aroſe: but the chief Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was from <hi>tender Minds,</hi> who fear'd ſuch a Conduct would be call'd a <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> One of the Gentlemen anſwer'd, he did not doubt, but <hi>Popery</hi> would blacken it with every <hi>odious</hi> Name.—That whatever was the Practice of other Nations, he was far from <hi>Oppreſſing</hi> or <hi>Forcing</hi> the <hi>Wills</hi> or <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men in <hi>religious Matters.</hi>— That the preſent Debate was not ſo much levell'd at their Religion, as the preventing the Ignorant being deceived and impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who pretended to the <hi>Name of it</hi>—as in the Caſe of <hi>Gypſies</hi> and <hi>Fortune-tellers,</hi> who rob the Weak, where a Juſtice of the Peace may, and ought, to ſend them to the Houſe of Correction, if not to the Plantations.—That the <hi>Maxim</hi> was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, in Regard to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that <hi>Ignorance</hi> was the <hi>Mother of Devotion;</hi> and that, were it poſſible to give the poor Natives a <hi>little</hi> Learning, they would be <hi>Honeſter,</hi> more <hi>Induſtrious,</hi> and in Time, find out how groſly they were deceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0558800101:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>MUCH more was ſaid on the Occaſion, and all agreed to do their utmoſt for the Relief of the <hi>Poor,</hi> in Reſpect to Supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and in every other Way for the General Good.—A few Examples being made, obliged thoſe <hi>Holy Nuſances</hi> to ſhift their Abode, and fly to a County in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> where <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two Hundred</hi> extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, were little regarded; and where <hi>Fryaries</hi> are common, and <hi>Nunneries</hi> more open, than at <hi>Hammerſmith</hi> near <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT the poorer Sort might not want Examples of Induſtry to ſpur them on, my Lord annually ſettled two or three poor <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Families on the Home Eſtate. He built them decent Dwellings, and lett them proper Farms. The more Children they had, his private Encouragement was the greater.</p>
               <p>HIS happy Imagination ſuggeſted to him a <hi>Scheme,</hi> productive of more Good, than was at firſt thought on.—He gave out, that in Compaſſion to the Poor of the Pariſh, he would take and maintain <hi>Ten Boys,</hi> not older than <hi>Twelve,</hi> or younger than <hi>Seven</hi> Years of Age, and have them taught ſome <hi>Trade</hi> or Buſineſs, that they might earn their Bread in an honeſt Way. The poor People preſs'd their Children on him with ſuch Eagerneſs, that he might have had an <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0558800101:63"/>
His Number was fix'd for Boys; but he permitted my Lady to add <hi>Ten Girls</hi> to his Plan. For theſe he built a convenient Houſe; maintain'd, and uniformly cloath'd, and fix'd a Proteſtant Family from the North, to teach them <hi>two Hours</hi> a Day to <hi>Read,</hi> and the Remainder, in ſuch Branches of the <hi>Linen Manufacture,</hi> as their Age would admit of.</p>
               <p>MY Lord made Regulations as he ſaw convenient. The Progreſs they made gave him vaſt Pleaſure, and her Ladyſhip a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Amuſement, as ſhe frequently viſited the Children, and heard them ſay their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and encouraged them in their Work. In a little Time they were able to join in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> on <hi>Sundays,</hi> and their Voices were a great Addition to the Service in a <hi>Country Church.</hi> Some few Attempts were made to pervert the Children, and make them return to their Parents, and conſequently to <hi>Sloth, Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Filth,</hi> but the Actors were ſoon oblig'd to quit the Country, and they were found to be <hi>Popiſh School-Maſters,</hi> who, generally ſpeaking, are <hi>Prieſts</hi> in Diſguiſe.</p>
               <p>FROM this Hint, ſo ſelf evidently advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the Kingdom, and from the Bounty and infinite Labours of a truly RIGHT REVEREND PRELATE, ſprung thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0558800101:64"/>
Schools of Induſtry, now known by the Name of the <hi>Incoporated Society, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Engliſh Proteſtant Schools in Ireland.</hi> The Application of the firſt Subſcription had ſo good an Effect, that HIS MAJESTY ſupported the Scheme by a <hi>Royal Charter;</hi> and encouraged the Spreading theſe Schools over <hi>Ireland,</hi> by a Grant of <hi>One Thouſand Pounds</hi> a Year. This, with the annual Bounties, and caſual Legacies from both Kingdoms, have enabled the Truſtees to extend their Views, and make the Charity more General. A Charity! where not a ſingle Inſtance of Miſapplication can be given. A Charity unparallell'd! and for which the next Generation muſt Bleſs the Promoters, as they muſt feel the happy Conſequences.</p>
               <p>FOR fuller Particulars of this <hi>noble Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> I muſt refer my kind Readers to the annual Accounts publiſh'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by their <hi>Correſpondent Society</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> When they examine and ſeriouſly conſider it, if they have Hearts, they muſt rejoice.</p>
               <p>BUT to return to my Lord.—Though Part of his Time was given to the Publick, his private Affairs were not neglected. He <hi>employ'd</hi> the Poor, which is the beſt Sort of Charity, in draining and making good Land of ſome Bogs. He planted Trees of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0558800101:65"/>
all Sorts. He mended and ſhortened the Roads; and, in a Word, he contrived, and ſpared no Expence in executing, what he judg'd of Publick Utility.</p>

In ſome Diſguſt at the Treatment he had met with, he return'd to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Son HENRY was now about Five, WILLIAM, Four, and his Daughter HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOT, Three Years of Age. Theſe began to demand his particular Attention. Her Ladyſhip was an uncommon Mother, for ſhe had not only taught them what their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0558800101:66"/>
Age was capable of; but had moſt prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented their being taught ſundry bad Habits, which might never be thoroughly eraſed. Scarcely were any of her Children able to <hi>walk,</hi> when ſhe took Opportunities of ſending them into the next Room at Night <hi>without a Candle;</hi> and as they grew up, ſhe found Reaſons to oblige them to go over the <hi>whole Houſe</hi> in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, neither did ſhe ever permit a <hi>Servant</hi> to ſtay with them, or a Candle to burn in the Room, when they were put to Bed. No <hi>Nurſe</hi> or <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> durſt venture to mention a ſingle <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>idle Story</hi> that could inſpire <hi>Fear</hi> into the Minds of the Children, except they choſe their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Diſcharge, which happened twice or thrice.—By this Method they had no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>imaginary Dangers,</hi> which ſaved them many uneaſy Hours in their Lives, which others feel for Want of ſuch a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEIR little Learning was not inculcated by the common Means of <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Duty.</hi> If my Lord gave them Halfpence, and they liſten'd to the Story of a <hi>poor Perſon,</hi> and relieved him, he was in great Delight.—When he had mentioned all the Bleſſings attending a <hi>Charitable</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate</hi> Temper; he'd turn to my Lady,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0558800101:67"/>
and ſay, <q>My Dear, the Children have been very good, and I deſire you will <hi>love</hi> and encourage them, and give them Leave to <hi>learn</hi> as much as they pleaſe.'— To this my Lady anſwer'd, 'Becauſe they have ſo much Senſe as to oblige you, I will take that Trouble on myſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ON the contrary, was any one of them guilty of a Fault, the higheſt <hi>Correction</hi> was, being depriv'd of their <hi>Book,</hi> refuſed being taught their Leſſon, and not regarded in the uſual Manner. On theſe Occaſions, the poor Delinquent was oblig'd to make his Peace, and enter into Grace, by <hi>Prayer, Repentance,</hi> and double Diligence; yet ſtill, this Matter was ſo contrived, that no <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy</hi> could ariſe amongſt them. The <hi>Good</hi> were ſuffered to pity the <hi>Faulty,</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for them; and, after the neceſſary Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, always ſucceeded. Often have they requeſted, and even ſupplicated her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to teach them, and ſhe often refus'd, as what gave her too much <hi>Pain,</hi> or, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Matters to mind of <hi>more Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:</hi> However, ſhe commonly ſuffer'd herſelf to be prevail'd on at laſt.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER ſome may imagine, there is certainly an Activity or Impulſe in the Soul, that gives it a Deſire and Longing for <hi>thoſe Things</hi> that are attainable but by <hi>Difficulty</hi>

and <hi>Labour;</hi> and a Diſregard, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, a Loathing even of our <hi>real Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> when, in a Manner, they are <hi>forced on us,</hi> or too <hi>cheaply purchaſed.</hi> Whether this ariſes from the Obſtinacy or Perverſeneſs of our Nature; or, is given to convince us, that the <hi>Love of Freedom</hi> is ſtrongly implanted in our Breaſts; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the wiſe End of employing the Mind, in ſearching after, and <hi>ſurmounting</hi> Difficulties, and to raiſe in us the Spirit of <hi>Emulation</hi> and proper <hi>Ambition,</hi> ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to Mankind, I ſhall not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, as it is out of my Province; but I can ſafely ſay, that whether this Principle ſprings from a <hi>Defect</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> in our Nature; theſe Parents chang'd the <hi>ſtrong Bias,</hi> if the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and <hi>cultivated</hi> and greatly <hi>improved</hi> it, if the <hi>Latter;</hi>—if a <hi>Defect,</hi> their Manner is ſtill more Praiſe-worthy, as they made it anſwer all the Ends of a <hi>Perfection.</hi>—The ſame Scheme, varied in Proportion as Age open'd their Minds, was conſtantly purſued in their Education, and the <hi>Leſſons</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> that were ſown, and had taken Root in their <hi>Childhood,</hi> grew up inſenſibly into <hi>Habits</hi> with their Years, and became <hi>Conſtitutional.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PRIDE, another Attendant on our Frame, was to be encounter'd and conquer'd by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0558800101:69"/>
my Lord.—As the little ones were, what is commonly call'd, <hi>fine Children,</hi> Care was taken to prevent their having <hi>too good</hi> an Opinion of their <hi>Perſons.</hi>—The Servants had particular Inſtructions on that Head; nor could they, without greatly diſobliging my Lord, praiſe a Child for its beautiful Face, Skin, or the like. Even the <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> were privately requeſted to avoid any Applauſe of that Sort; but when ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>extol,</hi> my Lord or Lady always <hi>drew back</hi> the Flattery, by aſſuring the Perſon, that all the Merit <hi>Harry</hi> had, was his being a <hi>good Boy;</hi> did what he was <hi>bid,</hi> ſaid his <hi>Prayers,</hi> and thank'd <hi>God</hi> that he had given him all his <hi>Limbs,</hi> and not made him <hi>crooked</hi> or <hi>deform'd,</hi> like many poor Children.</p>
               <p>IF my Lady caught <hi>Miſs</hi> looking too frequently in the Glaſs, and ſeemingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring her <hi>Features,</hi> ſhe order'd a beautiful <hi>China</hi> Figure to be brought, and deſiring her to obſerve its <hi>Complexion,</hi> its <hi>Eyes,</hi> its <hi>Teeth,</hi> &amp;c. would add,—<q>Perhaps this <hi>fine Lady</hi> is as fond of her dear Perſon as <hi>other Folks,</hi> and indeed I think, with as good Reaſon; for, do you know, my dear <hi>Harriot,</hi> what this <hi>pretty Thing</hi> is made of?—I aſſure you, 'tis of <hi>dirty Earth,</hi> juſt like <hi>you</hi> or <hi>me;</hi> ſo you may
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0558800101:70"/>
well imagine this <hi>Lump of Clay</hi> has great Reaſon to value itſelf, when in an Inſtant, if I think proper, I can brake it into a Thouſand Pieces, and make it <hi>Dirt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.'—Here, <hi>ſaid ſhe to a Servant,</hi> 'take this <hi>Thing</hi> away, it ſeems too much pleas'd with <hi>itſelf,</hi> to pleaſe me, or any body elſe.</q>—There needed no more to perſuade Miſs <hi>Harriot</hi> to retire from the Mirror, aſham'd of herſelf and of the Compariſon.</p>
               <p>WHEN the Buſineſs of their Book, which was always a voluntary Duty, or rather a Pleaſure, was over, they were indulged in every Amuſement, and not kept up in <hi>warm Rooms,</hi> to weaken their <hi>Sinews</hi> and enfeeble their <hi>Conſtitutions.</hi> The Boys were permitted to ramble in the Fields with a careful Servant or two, and uſe as much <hi>Exerciſe</hi> as they pleaſed, and their being <hi>dirty</hi> or <hi>wet</hi> on thoſe Occaſions, was never counted a Fault.—Sometimes my Lord and Lady were vaſtly amus'd, in entering into the <hi>Spirit</hi> of their Plays, and my Lord tumbled about the Room and join'd in their Mirth and Paſtime. By this Means, the Children were never happier than when with them. They ſeem'd like <hi>Companions</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> to each other; and, as they had no Secrets to hide, their Behaviour
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0558800101:71"/>
was <hi>chearful</hi> and without <hi>Reſtraint.</hi> If ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, they were timorous, it was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of Love and Affection, and Fear of diſobliging.</p>
               <p>AT their Meals my Lord and Lady in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them without their perceiving their main Deſign; for they never directly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any one, or gave them Directions or Advice to <hi>do this,</hi> or <hi>avoid that.</hi>—Their Counſel was always given <hi>obliquely,</hi> by praiſing ſuch a Gentleman's Son, <q>who was ſo <hi>extreamly good;</hi> that, though no more than Five Years old, he read ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly well, had all the <hi>Pſalms</hi> by heart, and wanted much to learn to <hi>Write.</hi>
                  </q> Then my Lord would add, <q>I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his Father to <hi>indulge</hi> the Child, and have prevail'd.'—'I told you, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd my Lady,</hi> that <hi>that Boy</hi> would do well, for I have always found him fond of his <hi>Book.</hi>
                  </q> —Sometimes my Lord much pity'd a Gentleman, who had ſpent a great deal of Money on his Son's Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 'The Boy, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> was ſuch a <hi>Fool</hi> he would learn nothing, but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with the <hi>Servants;</hi> ſo that now, the poor Man is obliged to bind him <hi>Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> to a Captain of a <hi>dirty Ship.</hi>'—'I am heartily ſorry, <hi>reply'd my Lady,</hi> for the good Man, and for his <hi>ſilly Son;</hi> but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0558800101:72"/>
ſince the Boy would not be a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> I think his Father was in the Right to oblige him to live in <hi>Dirt</hi> and <hi>Naſtineſs,</hi> eſpecially ſince he lov'd it.'</p>
               <p>NOT a Word of theſe Sort of Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was loſt to the Children. Their little Thoughts were ſet to work, and they never failed making the Application. They were very fond of <hi>Gay's Fables,</hi> and always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to my Lord and Lady for the juſt Meaning when in Doubt, and received An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, not only ſatisfactory, but pleaſant and entertaining. On theſe and every other Occaſion, they were ſpoken to by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Tutor in <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>elegant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> and were ſet right if their Anſwers were not in the beſt Terms.</p>
               <p>A ſevere Reprimand was ſcarcely ever uſed, but when they were guilty of ſome <hi>Act,</hi> that had the leaſt Tendency to <hi>Cruelty</hi> or <hi>Ill-nature.</hi>—The <hi>Torturing a Fly</hi> or a <hi>Sparrow</hi>—a <hi>pert Anſwer</hi> to a poor Perſon or a Servant, were <hi>Crimes,</hi> that brought a <hi>Rebuke</hi> and a <hi>Leſſon</hi> that ended in <hi>Tears,</hi> and an Acknowledgment of the Fault; but if they told an <hi>Untruth,</hi> or <hi>prevaricated</hi> on any Examination, no <hi>Intereſt,</hi> nor all the Promiſes they could make, were capable to prevent a <hi>Chaſtiſement</hi> that made the Guilty and Innocent <hi>tremble.</hi> The Maxim
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0558800101:73"/>
of my Lord was, never to puniſh in a <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and as ſeldom as poſſible; but when really neceſſary, to do it <hi>effectually;</hi> and not make it a <hi>mere Ceremony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WITH regard to their <hi>Servants,</hi> they were look'd on, almoſt in the Light of <hi>Children,</hi> and had a natural Right to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> and <hi>Advice.</hi> As <hi>Servants,</hi> they were obliged to a Strictneſs in their <hi>Duty,</hi> but as <hi>Men,</hi> they were treated with that <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> every Creature is intitled to. They <hi>obey'd</hi> their Orders with <hi>Alacrity</hi> and <hi>Chearfulneſs,</hi> becauſe they were never given with <hi>Haughtineſs,</hi> or in an <hi>angry</hi> Manner.</p>
               <p>FOR a Nobleman, he had many uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ſingular Notions. He had <hi>Prayers</hi> every Morning and Night, and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily aſſiſted with great Decency. His Lordſhip thought, that the Duties of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> were of the utmoſt Conſequence to <hi>Society,</hi> and the only Security for the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> of Man to Man.—He was ſurprized, how People could, with Juſtice, complain of the <hi>Theft, Drunkenneſs,</hi> and other Immoralities of their <hi>Servants,</hi> when they not only took no Care to perſuade them of the Odiouſneſs of ſuch Practices, by ordering them to attend the Service of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0558800101:74"/>
the <hi>Church,</hi> but too frequently gave Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>theſe Vices</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p>THOUGH I have mentioned <hi>Theft</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Vices of Gentlemen, ſurely thoſe who run in <hi>Debt</hi> to Tradeſmen, and ſuffer them to waſte their <hi>Time</hi> in vain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after ther <hi>Property,</hi> commit a <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi> of the blackeſt Kind, and deſerve equal Puniſhment with thoſe Wretches, who have openly ventur'd their Lives to maintain their Extravagancies, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſatisfy their <hi>real</hi> Wants.</p>
               <p>THIS Sort of Conduct was unknown in the Family, where, on the Delivery of any Commodity, <hi>the Value</hi> was inſtantly paid. By this Means he was better ſerv'd, leſs impos'd on, and bought cheaper than moſt of his Neighbours. Few Things ſurpriz'd him more, than how a Man can live and pretend to <hi>any Degree</hi> of Comfort or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, when <hi>indebted</hi> to Numbers, and for large Sums.—He imagined that the many Examples of the <hi>fatal</hi> Conſequence of ſuch abſurd Management, ought to perſuade them into an oppoſite Behaviour; but the Want of Thought or proper Reflection, plung'd them into Extravagance, then into Mortgages, Law-Suits, and Diſcredit.—If poſſible, they avail themſelves of an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and ſcandalous Practice,
<q>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0558800101:75"/>And fly from Bailiffs into Parliament.</q>
Still the Evils accumulate, and often end in a <hi>Gaol,</hi> in the <hi>Ruin</hi> of their Families, and the Families of many of their <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MY Lord was not only punctual and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in his Dealings, but every one under him was almoſt compell'd to the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, for they knew his being a <hi>Nobleman</hi> gave them no <hi>Authority</hi> to commit, nor would protect them from the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> due to an <hi>illegal</hi> or <hi>unjuſt</hi> Action.</p>
               <p>METHOD makes ſeeming Difficulties quite eaſy, and a prudent Conduct brings that Peace and Satisfaction of Mind, which we term <hi>Happineſs.</hi> His Lordſhip's Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city was not merely confin'd to the Proſpect of his own regular Family; for he had the Pleaſure to obſerve, that many of his Neighbours adopted ſome of his Rules, and that the <hi>poorer Sort</hi> began to practice a few. —If my Lord and his whole Family were conſtant at <hi>Church,</hi> the Gentry round, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to think it <hi>ungenteel,</hi> and were as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as they.—If my Lord made <hi>Reſponſes</hi> of the <hi>Service,</hi> or ſung <hi>Pſalms</hi> with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Voice, and was really <hi>intent</hi> on the <hi>Duties</hi> of the Place, the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation were brought to believe, that their aſſembling was for other Purpoſes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0558800101:76"/>
than ſhewing their <hi>Finery, Gigling, Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bowing,</hi> and the like. The Prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Example, ought to oblige us to a Rectitude of Conduct, for a <hi>bad one</hi> makes us, in ſome Meaſure, guilty of the Faults of <hi>others,</hi> as a <hi>good one</hi> adds to <hi>their</hi> Virtues, and <hi>our own Merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS my Lord and Lady were bleſſed with great Good-nature and Underſtanding, ſo were they happy in a ſincere and mutual Affection. The World was not convinc'd of this from a <hi>fooliſh idle Fondneſs,</hi> when in Company; but by their <hi>Chearfulneſs, good Humour</hi> and <hi>Complacency</hi> to each other, and all preſent.—MY Lord knew of what <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature</hi> is compounded, and that, to keep up this Harmony, ſo eſſential to their <hi>Happineſs,</hi> a little Management was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſary. He knew, that the moſt precious Cordials become <hi>inſipid,</hi> if too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed, and that Nothing contributed more to preſerve the true Reliſh of <hi>Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Felicity,</hi> than a <hi>Decency,</hi> even to <hi>Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>—They roſe early in the Morning, and inſtantly retir'd to their own Apartments, and never appear'd to each other, but, if not <hi>as fine,</hi> at leaſt <hi>as clean,</hi> as when going to <hi>Court.</hi> They were ſo exact in this Point, that they had <hi>two Beds</hi> in their Chamber, and frequently ſlept aſunder. This gave a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0558800101:77"/>
                  <hi>Reliſh</hi> and a <hi>Poignancy</hi> to their moſt <hi>refined Joys,</hi> and brought with it that Sort of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> that attends on <hi>Novelty,</hi> without the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Variety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WERE I to be minute on the whole <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> of the Family, this would rather be the <hi>Memoirs of Lord</hi> TRUEGOOD, than the Hiſtory of JACK CONNOR.—The many Methods he practiſed to avoid <hi>Drinking to Exceſs</hi> himſelf, and preventing it in others; —His ſundry Contrivances to convince the <hi>Poor</hi> of the Neceſſity of <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry;</hi> His ſucceſsful Arts to aboliſh <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Swearing</hi> in his Family and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the many Schemes made uſe of, to perſuade the Natives into <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,</hi> would fill a Volume.—What has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſaid, are merely <hi>Sketches,</hi> and the <hi>Out-lines</hi> of the Picture: The nice Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the <hi>Features,</hi> with the <hi>Colouring</hi> and <hi>Drapery,</hi> I muſt leave to the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>ſkilful</hi> Reader, whilſt I purſue the Account of my little Friend.</p>

               <p>NEXT Morning Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> found the Servants in the ſame merry Mood, and very chearfully agreed with them, but could by no Means gueſs the <hi>real Cauſe.</hi> He forgot not however, to ſend Mrs. <hi>Mathews</hi> to <hi>John Long</hi>'s, to enquire after little <hi>Jack.</hi> She return'd in Raptures.—'Lord, Mr. <hi>Kindly, ſaid ſhe,</hi> I never ſaw ſo fine a Child in all my <hi>born Days;</hi> to be ſure his Father was a healthy Man, and a good natur'd Man, for the little Fellow is as ſtrong as <hi>Herclus,</hi> and his Complexion is as fine <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Red,</hi> as any <hi>King's Son</hi> in the Land; and he laughs and ſmiles, and is as happy as <hi>any Thing.</hi> God bleſs it!—Though I am a <hi>Virgin,</hi> as I may ſay, yet I <hi>thinks</hi> I ſhould not bluſh, if he was
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0558800101:79"/>
my own Son, and I am ſure you need not be aſhamed of him, for 'tis no Harm for a Man.'—'How, how, <hi>ſaid Kindly,</hi> ſo, Mrs. <hi>Mathews,</hi> you would infer that the Child is mine'—'Eh? Lord, Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> He's ſo like'—She would have ſaid more, but the <hi>Muſcles</hi> of her Face took an involuntary Motion, and oblig'd her to run off in a loud Laugh.—<q>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I have at laſt found out the Reaſon of ſo much Diverſion in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. How apt are People to think <hi>amiſs,</hi> and <hi>invent</hi> Scandal. They are happy, when they can indulge the Thought, that their Superiors do <hi>wrong;</hi> becauſe, in ſome Sort, it brings them down to their own <hi>Level,</hi> and when we walk in the ſame Line, no wonder if our <hi>Authority</hi> is diminiſhed.—I'm pleas'd however, they think no worſe of me, for in this they will ſoon find their Error.</q>—He was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on with many moral Reflections, and conſidering how to proceed, when the Bell ſummoned him to Dinner.</p>
               <p>AT Table, my Lady's Woman was a little merry, and gave ſuch Hints about <hi>old Men</hi> and <hi>young Girls,</hi> that my Lord's Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman could not forbear joyning in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. He declar'd, that if venerable <hi>Neſtors</hi> practis'd ſuch Gambols in the Pariſh, he,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0558800101:80"/>
and all the young Fellows would be obliged to run away for Shame.—<q>No, no, Mr. <hi>Sympſon, cry'd</hi> Mrs. <hi>Tittle,</hi> You ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtay, when you are ſure of finding an <hi>old Fellow</hi> to Father your <hi>Handy-work.</hi>' —Very true indeed, Madam, <hi>ſaid Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> but you know they ſay, an <hi>old Cock</hi> treads ſure.</q>—At this witty Stroke Mrs. <hi>Tittle</hi> laugh'd immoderately, and fix'd her Eyes on Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> but the <hi>Butler</hi> look'd grave, and having empty'd his Glaſs, ſaid, <q>Why lookee, Madam, <hi>d'ye ſee,</hi> when I am in Company, I love to underſtand what the Company ſay; ſo, <hi>d'ye ſee,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>as how,</hi> I don't know what you and that Gentleman laugh at, mayhap it is at me.

               <p>MR.

               <p>MRS. LONG had taken great Care to waſh him well and clean, and comb his Head. His fine light-brown Hair hung in natural Curls, and his Complexion was remarkably good.

               <p>MY Lord and Lady ſeem'd charm'd with his Countenance, tho' the poor Child was in the utmoſt Confuſion and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—My Lord's two Sons now came in, and my Lady call'd them to her.—'My dear <hi>Harry, ſaid ſhe,</hi> here is a poor little Boy that has loſt his Father and Mother, and was ſtripp'd of all his Cloaths. I believe he is a very good Child; ſo, you know, 'twould be a Sin to let him go quite naked, and ſtarve.'—'O dear, <hi>ſaid

Harry,</hi> indeed I'll give him my brown Coat and Breeches.'—'And indeed, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>ſaid Billy,</hi> I'll give him a Shirt and a Pair of Stockings.'—'And I'm ſure, <hi>ſaid Harry,</hi> my Shoes will be large enough.' —They ſaw my Lady's conſenting Looks, and inſtantly ran to perform their Promiſe. All were pleas'd at the Tenderneſs and Good-nature of the Children; and whilſt they were abſent, Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> ask'd <hi>Jack,</hi> where was his Book? The Boy could juſt ſay, <hi>'here, Sir,'</hi> and gave it him.—<q>This Book, my Lord, <hi>ſaid Kindly,</hi> has greatly prejudiced me in Favour of this <hi>poor Child.</hi> I caught him reading in it, and I made him turn to another Part, which he diſtinctly read; and, by Accident, it was this Paragraph.</q>—Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> gave the Book to Mr. <hi>Caſſock,</hi> who read it, which affected my Lord, but brought Tears into my Lady Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THERE ſeems to me, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> ſomewhat remarkable in the Story of this Child; I'll try him a little.</q> Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mrs. <hi>Long,</hi> told her to leave the Boy with him.

               <p>THE two Boys, by this Time, had got the Cloaths, and running with them into the Parlour, were going immediately to ſtrip <hi>poor Jack,</hi> but my Lord ſtopp'd them, and kiſſing <hi>Harry,</hi> told him, 'He was ſo good and <hi>charitable,</hi> he would give him the prettieſt <hi>little Horſe</hi> he could get, and a Bridle and Saddle.'—'And becauſe, <hi>ſaid my Lady,</hi> my dear <hi>Billy</hi> follow'd his Brother's good Example, I ſhall do as much for him.'—The Children were quite happy, and <hi>Harry</hi> ran, as my Lord bid him, for Mrs. <hi>Long.</hi>—<q>Here, Mrs. <hi>Long, ſaid my Lord,</hi> take back your little Fellow for this Night.

               <p>MRS. LONG found the Coat and other Things, fitted <hi>Jack</hi> very well, and had dreſs'd him with great Neatneſs. On his Arrival at my Lord's, the whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admir'd his <hi>Strength</hi> and his exact <hi>Make,</hi> but he ſeem'd more <hi>aukward</hi> than before, and was very uneaſy with his Shoes. Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> provided him with ſome Neceſſaries, and employ'd him in attending my Lord's Sons in their Amuſements, and in cleaning their Shoes, and bruſhing their Coats. At leiſure Times he heard him read in the <hi>Bible,</hi> or his own Book, and my Lord and Lady often did the ſame.</p>
               <p>IN ſix Months the Boy was quite chang'd. The chearful and happy Diſpoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd him by Nature, ſhew'd itſelf on a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0558800101:93"/>
thouſand Occaſions; inſomuch, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a general Favourite, and was ſenſible of his Happineſs. Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> from Time to Time gave him ſuch Leſſons of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> as ſuited his Age, and Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> taught him his <hi>Prayers, Catechiſm,</hi> and other Matters, equal with my Lord's Children.</p>
               <p>ONE Day, as Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> was writing in his Office, <hi>Jack</hi> approach'd him, and bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but with a modeſt Smile, look'd up, and ſeem'd as if he had a Favour to ask. —'Well <hi>Jack, ſaid the good Man,</hi> d'ye want another Book.'—'No indeed, Sir, <hi>reply'd the Child,</hi> I don't want a Book.' —'Why, you Rogue, <hi>ſaid Kindly,</hi> I hope you are not tir'd of Reading?' 'Yes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Sir, <hi>ſaid Jack.</hi>' 'O ho, <hi>ſaid the old Man,</hi> very well, ſince you will not read, and be a good Boy, I ſhall get you a Leather Coat and Cap, and you ſhall be a Poſtillion, and lie with the Horſes.' <hi>Jack</hi>'s Countenance chang'd, his Eyes ſwell'd, and he burſt into a violent Fit of Crying.—Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> was a long Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could dry his Tears, or get him to ſpeak and explain what he wanted.—<q>Sir, <hi>ſaid Jack at laſt,</hi> indeed and indeed, I am not tir'd of Reading, for if you pleaſe, I would be very good, and write as you
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0558800101:94"/>
do, if you'd give me Pens and Paper.</q> —The Tenderneſs of the old Gentleman was touch'd at the Child's Requeſt.—<q>Yes, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> my dear <hi>Jack,</hi> you ſhall have Pens and Paper, and I will get you a little Desk in the Office, and teach you to write myſelf.</q>—<hi>Jack</hi> was quite delighted, and the Novelty of the Employment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and pleaſed Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> particularly as his Pupil was ſo apt a Scholar, that in eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Months he wrote a very good Hand, and perfectly underſtood the four firſt Rules of Arithmetick.</p>
               <p>HE was now about Ten Years of Age, and ſeem'd to have a Faculty in learning whatever he undertook. In the Plays of Children he was dexterous, and in the little Occupations of the Family, he was Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Neat. He had a certain Manner of doing Things, that <hi>Nature</hi> alone can give, and what ſome can only <hi>imitate,</hi> even by <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Pains.</hi> Another natural Gift began at this Time to be remarkable, for he had a fine Voice, and greatly diverted the Maids with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Songs. Some were of Humour, and requir'd a proper Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Voice and Words to keep up the Drollery. This he was a perfect Maſter of.</p>

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0558800101:95"/>The Boys were one Morning at Play in the Fields, and Mr. <hi>Caſſock,</hi> who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended them, was, by Accident, at a good Diſtance. Maſter <hi>Harry</hi> and <hi>Jack</hi> had ſome Words, and <hi>Harry</hi> gave him a Blow on the Face. <hi>Jack</hi> greatly reſented this, and told him, if he was not my Lord's Son, he'd beat him heartily. <hi>Harry,</hi> fir'd at the Rebuke and Menace, pull'd off his Coat, and flew at him like a little Tiger. <hi>Jack</hi> defended himſelf without returning a Stroke, though his Hair was almoſt torn off his Head. At laſt he receiv'd a violent Cut which ſtunn'd him, and made his Noſe bleed. He then cried out moſt bitterly, and run directly Home. The Tutor heard his Cries, and ſaw him running, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Boys, Maſter <hi>Billy</hi> told him the real Truth. As <hi>Jack</hi> was entering the Houſe, my Lord ſaw him from a Window in his Study, and order'd a Servant to bring him up. With ſome Difficulty he got the Story out of him, and Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> and the two Boys entering with my Lady, my Lord was confirm'd in the Truth of what he ſaid, and looking very <hi>ſerious,</hi> and in great <hi>Concern,</hi> ſat down and took up his Book.</p>
               <p>'I AM, <hi>ſaid my Lady,</hi> quite ſurpriz'd and aſtoniſh'd, that <hi>Harry</hi> could behave

in ſo brutal a Manner to a poor Boy that loves him.— Come hither <hi>Jack, ſaid ſhe,</hi> —Do you think you could beat <hi>Harry,</hi> if you were to box and fight fairly?' 'Yes indeed, pleaſe your Ladyſhip, <hi>ſaid Jack,</hi> for Maſter <hi>Harry</hi> knows I'm ſtronger than him.'—'Very well, <hi>reply'd my Lady,</hi> I believe what you ſay, and now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, you have my Lord's Leave and mine, to beat him ſoundly whenever he ſtrikes you again.'—Then turning to a Servant, order'd <hi>Jack</hi> to be taken down and clean'd.— Poor <hi>Harry</hi> was in great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but when my Lady, very gravely, directed <hi>him to go to the Kitchen, and dine with the Servants,</hi> he cry'd moſt dreadfully. —<q>Why, Sir, <hi>ſaid my Lady,</hi> you are fit for no other Company; for, when a young Gentlemen will fight with his Servant, does he not make him his equal? But I ſuppoſe you think you may do what you pleaſe with <hi>Jack;</hi> but to convince you, Sir, you are no better than him, except you behave better, you ſhall wear <hi>his Cloaths,</hi> and he <hi>yours,</hi> and then I believe every Stranger will take him for <hi>Maſter Harry,</hi> and you for <hi>Jack Connor.</hi>

               <p>HARRY begg'd and intreated, and gave many Promiſes of never doing the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.—<q>You ſee, <hi>ſaid my Lady,</hi> when one

does a naughty Thing, no-body ſpeaks in our Favour.

If Maſter <hi>Harry</hi> was a Gentleman, and had beaten a Servant of mine, I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reſent the Affront, except he begg'd, and obtain'd my Servant's Pardon.'— That's true indeed, <hi>ſaid my Lady,</hi> ſo, my dear <hi>Billy,</hi> call up <hi>Jack,</hi> and I am ſure <hi>Harry</hi> will beg his Pardon very ſincerely.' —Mr. <hi>Caſſock,</hi> who knew his Time, began now to intercede for Maſter <hi>Harry,</hi> and aſſur'd my Lord he never knew him do a Thing of that Sort, or put himſelf into ſo violent a Paſſion before; that, as it was the <hi>firſt Fault,</hi> he begg'd my Lord to forgive him, and could almoſt promiſe it would be the laſt.</p>
               <p>MY Lord ſhak'd his Head, and the two Boys entering, my Lady ſpoke to <hi>Harry,</hi> who immediately went and kiſs'd <hi>Jack,</hi> and very heartily ask'd his Pardon. <hi>Jack</hi> bluſh'd, but with a Smile bow'd, and kiſs'd him again.—<hi>Harry</hi> then went to my Lord, and on his Knees begg'd his Forgiveneſs. My Lord rais'd him, ſaying, <q>I forgive
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0558800101:98"/>
you, my Dear, this Fault, ſince you are ſorry for committing it, but depend on <hi>your Honour,</hi> that you will keep your Word, and never vex your Papa again. Now go and beg my Lady's Pardon, for you have greatly offended and fretted her.</q> —My Lady took him in her Arms, and the Affair ended much to the Satisfaction of all Parties.</p>
               <p>TWO Days after, the three Boys, the Chaplain, and a Servant with a Gun, went in the Morning to walk as uſual. A ſmall Rivulet run by one of the Fields, which they generally croſs'd by the Help of large Stones, but an Abundance of Rain having fallen, it was rais'd above four Feet, and very rapid. This ſtopp'd their Progreſs; but, as they mounted the Brook to find an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Paſſage, Harry</hi> ſaw a <hi>Jack-daw</hi> in a Tree on the oppoſite Side, and the Boys begg'd the Servant to fire at it, and they mounted the Ditch to ſee it fall. <hi>Jack</hi> went a little lower to get a convenient Stand, but ſcarcely had he been there a Moment, when, the Earth breaking under <hi>Harry</hi>'s Feet, he fell into the River.—His Brother ſhriek'd, but <hi>Jack</hi> inſtantly took Hold of a Bough of a Tree that fell near the Water, and ſtretching out as far as he was able, caught <hi>Harry</hi> by the Hair, juſt as he roſe, having
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0558800101:99"/>
been carryed by the Stream about ten Yards, and held him faſt.—<hi>Billy</hi> roar'd and ſtamp'd, and the poor Parſon and Servant were frighten'd almoſt into <hi>Stupidity,</hi> till <hi>Jack</hi> call'd out <hi>here—here.</hi>—They got to him juſt in Time, for his whole Weight reſting on his left Arm, his <hi>little</hi> Force was almoſt exhauſted.—<hi>Caſſock</hi> and the Servant jump'd in directly, and reſcu'd <hi>Harry;</hi> but, not immediately attending to the Care of <hi>Jack,</hi> the poor Boy could not retire, but fell in between them. However, they divided their Labour, and brought the Children ſafely out.</p>
               <p>JACK had only got a Ducking, but <hi>Harry</hi> was ſome Time before he could ſpeak, but being laid on the Graſs, he ſoon recovered. The Tenderneſs of the Boys is not to be expreſs'd; they kiſs'd him a thouſand Times, and even cry'd with Joy. Mr. <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock,</hi> fearing they might catch Cold, walk'd pretty ſmartly towards the Houſe, near which they met my Lord, looking over ſome Improvements. He was greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at the Condition they were all in, but much more ſo, when the Chaplain told him of the Accident, and particularly of <hi>Jack</hi>'s ready Thought. My Lord was much mov'd, and moſt affectionately embracing the Children, carry'd them to my Lady,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0558800101:100"/>
who waited their coming in to Breakfaſt. —As my Lord told her the Story, <hi>Love, Tenderneſs, Surpriſe</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> were viſible in her Countenance. Her Heart ſeemed ready to leap from its Habitation, and the <hi>whole Mother</hi> ruſhing violently on her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſhe ſeiz'd <hi>Harry</hi> in her Arms, and would have fall'n with him, had not my Lord and Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> ſupported her to her Chair, where ſhe did not recover till her Tears were ſuffer'd to come to her Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>THE Boys were put in warm Beds, and the Chaplain was advis'd to change his Cloaths. My Lord and the Women ſtayed with my Lady, and indeed ſhe had great Occaſion for them.—Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> had been abſent on Buſineſs; but when he return'd, and heard of the Affair, he trembled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively; but Joy ſucceeding, he ran to my Lord, and Lady, then to the two Boys, whom he almoſt ſmother'd with Careſſes, then to the Chaplain, and then to my Lord again. In a Word, the <hi>poor Man</hi> could think and ſpeak of Nothing elſe, and even of that not very diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>THE Hurry of the Family ceas'd by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and all Matters were ſet right by Dinner Time, and <hi>Jack</hi> took his Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Boys, whom he always waited on.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0558800101:101"/>
A Neighbouring Gentleman hearing of the Accident, came to felicitate my Lord on Maſter <hi>Harry</hi>'s providential Eſcape.—At Dinner it was the particular Converſation, and Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> was compell'd to repeat the Morning Adventure with all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which often oblig'd <hi>Jack</hi> to bluſh and hold down his Head.—My Lord bid him never to be aſhamed at doing Good, and the Gentleman was very laviſh of his Praiſes.—My Lady look'd at Maſter <hi>Harry,</hi> and hinting at the Quarrel, ſaid,—<q>We may plainly ſee how much it is our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> to be <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Friendly</hi> to, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void giving Offence to the <hi>pooreſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſince every Man, however <hi>low</hi> or <hi>mean,</hi> may, if he pleaſes, be of <hi>great Uſe,</hi> or do an irreparable <hi>Injury</hi> to the <hi>Greateſt.</hi> Let what will be our Situations, we are born to <hi>help</hi> and <hi>aſſiſt</hi> each other, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Power and Abilities, and he, who does it not, deſtroys the End of his Creation.—This, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> is a plain Truth, and I hope you and your Brother will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and practiſe it, as long as you live.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THUS, out of every Accident, or the moſt common Occurences, did theſe <hi>wiſe Parents</hi> inculcate <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> in the Minds of their Children, and gave them
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0558800101:102"/>
a moral Certainty of their being hereafter <hi>happy</hi> in themſelves, and of making others <hi>happy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the Evening the Gentleman took his Leave, and calling <hi>Jack,</hi> kiſs'd him and put a Crown in his Hand, which he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately depoſited with Mr. <hi>Kindly.</hi> My Lord gave the Servant which had been with the Children, a Farm worth Ten Pounds a Year. Many poor neighbouring Families felt, on this Occaſion, his Goodneſs and Liberality, and he added ten Children more to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Scheme before-mentioned. The Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain was not forgot in my Lord's Thoughts, and my Lady order'd <hi>Jack</hi> new Cloaths from Head to Foot.</p>
               <p>AS the Family was extremely belov'd, no Wonder if all the Gentlemen round con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome Time to viſit and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate them on their good Fortune. Scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one quitted <hi>Bounty-Hall,</hi> without a Mark of Regard for <hi>Jack.</hi> Theſe he always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> ſo that his Riches at laſt amounted to the mighty Sum of <hi>Ten Pounds.</hi>

               <p>PERHAPS my merry Readers are extremely angry at being ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Company with <hi>Boys,</hi> whilſt others of a more ſerious Turn are pleas'd with the Opening of the Heart, and the gradual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Knowledge in the Minds of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Others again, reading only as a mere Amuſement, and to <hi>kill Time,</hi> are in an actual State of Indifference, and provided the great End is anſwer'd, are equally charm'd with <hi>Clariſſa,</hi> as <hi>Tom Jones.</hi> That theſe Claſſes may be gratified, I ſhall beg Leave to introduce a young Lady, by way of Epiſode; and becauſe ſhe is the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my good Friend Mr. <hi>Kindly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MISS BETTY KINDLY, now turn'd of Twenty, was a moſt agreeable Girl, with good Senſe and good Humour. Mr. <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock</hi> had a ſmall paternal Fortune, a good Allowance from my Lord, and forty Pounds
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0558800101:104"/>
a Year, for officiating for the Miniſter of the Pariſh, who was about Fourſcore Years of Age. This young Gentleman was not inſenſible of the Charms of Miſs <hi>Betty,</hi> and of her more eſſential Qualifications; and knowing my Lord's Sons would ſoon be removed from <hi>his Care,</hi> determin'd to take the Advantage of the general Joy, and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit my Lady's Intereſt. He ſuffer'd not the Time to elapſe, but took the firſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity when my Lady was alone.—She rally'd him a little at firſt, on his being <hi>in Love,</hi> but aſſuring him of all her good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, added, —<q>I believe a <hi>little</hi> of my Intereſt will go <hi>a great Way,</hi> for I much doubt if you have not a powerful <hi>Friend</hi> already in the <hi>Garriſon.</hi>
                  </q>—Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> bluſh'd, and, aukwardly thanking her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip, retir'd.—It ſeems Mademoiſelle <hi>Le Meagre</hi> had inform'd her of what paſs'd in Miſs <hi>Betty</hi>'s Heart, which ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, by ſome Obſervations on her late Conduct.</p>
               <p>MY Lord was extremely pleaſed at this Diſcovery, and declar'd it was what he had always wiſh'd. After Dinner he ſent for Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> and the Chat at laſt fell on <hi>Jack Connor.</hi>—<q>I wiſh, my Lord, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> you would permit my inſtructing that poor Boy in the Duty of my Station. He
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0558800101:105"/>
is ſurpriſingly <hi>diligent, notable,</hi> and <hi>honeſt;</hi> and ſo expert at his Pen, that, young as he is, he has often aſſiſted me.—I think I have been a faithful Servant to your Lordſhip, and your truly <hi>noble Father,</hi> who bred me from a Child; and it would give me the greateſt Joy to have almoſt a Certainty of leaving as juſt a one to ſucceed me.—Age, my Lord, ſteals on, and ſhould Heaven indulge me with a few more Years of Strength and Abilities, I muſt then ſubmit to our common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny.</q>—My Lord wink'd at her <hi>Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and ſhe at Mr. <hi>Caſſock,</hi> who inſtantly withdrew, and my Lady ſoon follow'd.</p>
               <p>'JACK, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> has ſav'd my Son; if I had no other Motive than that, you may be aſſur'd he is greatly in my Thoughts; but I love the Boy for many Reaſons, having notic'd particularly his Behaviour; but as I am determin'd to ſend him with my Sons to Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s, where he may learn a little more, we muſt poſtpone your Scheme till his Return.— Since you think, <hi>continued my Lord,</hi> ſo much of my <hi>Jack,</hi> give me Leave to think a little of <hi>your Betty.</hi>—The Girl is of Age, and you know young Wenches are <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi>—In two Words, poor <hi>Caſſock</hi> loves her; and, if my Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0558800101:106"/>
be right, <hi>Betty</hi> is far from diſlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; therefore, if you approve of the Match, the <hi>Parſon</hi> muſt have ſome Money to buy a <hi>new Gown,</hi> and a freſh Cargoe of <hi>Sermons.</hi>'—'Does your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip approve of it, <hi>ſaid Kindly?</hi> 'I do, <hi>ſaid my Lord.</hi>'—'Then, <hi>reply'd the old Man,</hi> I have no Will, but your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's, and To-morrow, Sir, I ſhall put into your Hands the Value of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, and ſubmit my <hi>dear Child</hi> to your Lordſhip's Judgment, thinking myſelf the happieſt of Men, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Indulgence of the <hi>beſt of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.'</hi>

                  <q>I thank you, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> for your Compliment, and to ſhew you how much I approve of this Union, and that your Daughter may be under your own Eye, I intend to preſent Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> to this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, on the Death of the preſent <hi>Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent.</hi> You know 'tis worth two hundred Pounds a Year, and that Dr. <hi>Canter</hi> is ſuperannuated, and cannot laſt long.</q>— <hi>Kindly,</hi> with uplifted Hands, was attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to utter his Gratitude, but my Lord ſtopp'd him, ſaying,—<q>No more of that, Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> I am now going to advance this Matter,</q> And retiring, left the happy <hi>old Man</hi> but the Power of thanking <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>

and admiring the Goodneſs of <hi>my Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN a few Days Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> was preſented in Form to Miſs <hi>Kindly.</hi> All the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Family was on the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wedding, which was fix'd at no longer a Diſtance than a Week, and ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Families were invited.</p>
               <p>WERE I a <hi>French</hi> Memoir Writer, I ſhould naturally embrace this Opportunity to extol the <hi>Virgin Charms</hi> of the Bride, and deſcribe the Beauty and Propriety of every Part of her Dreſs without a ſlaviſh Regard to Truth. I ſhould then have ſaid,— <q>Scarcely were the Curtains drawn which permitted the Sun's Appearance, when <hi>Miſs</hi> opened thoſe <hi>Eyes,</hi> that alone could eclipſe his <hi>Brightneſs.</hi> She ſigh'd, and ſometimes wiſh'd, and ſometimes trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the Approach of the Time, when ſhe was to <hi>be,—ſhe knew not what,</hi>—ſhe knew <hi>not where.</hi> Hope and Fear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs'd her whole Imagination till the Hour arriv'd, when ſhe bid an eternal Adieu to that Bed, deſtin'd never more to embrace her <hi>Virgin Innocence.</hi> Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>Le Meagre</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Tittle</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in adjuſting her Dreſs, and her Ladyſhip deigned to give her Advice and Help. Her <hi>Treſſes</hi> were of the fineſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0558800101:108"/>
Brown, which hanging behind in ſmall natural Ringlets, were nicely order'd to crown her Forehead, and touch her Ears which were ornamented with <hi>Brilliants;</hi> and, though of the firſt Water, her <hi>Charms</hi> added a particular <hi>Luſtre</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgency</hi> to. Diamonds likewiſe ſparkled round her lovely <hi>Neck,</hi> and, a little above the heavenly <hi>Orbs,</hi> hung the glittering Croſs,
<q>Which <hi>JEWS</hi> might kiſs and Infidels adore.</q>
Her Stays diſcover'd a Shape the moſt exact and delicate, and the Robe that clos'd on it, was of the fineſt white Silk of <hi>Padua.</hi> A Bunch of <hi>Jaſmin, Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinths</hi> and <hi>Roſes,</hi> took their Place near her Neck, and ſeem'd to envy the Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a <hi>ſuperior</hi> Fragrancy. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the Apartment where the Company, and her deſiring Lover, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently attended, and where a moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent and elegant Dinner was provided. The firſt Courſe conſiſted of</q>—I hope the courteous Reader will excuſe my not proceeding farther in <hi>mere Sound,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſay in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that the Wedding-Day at laſt came, and that Miſs <hi>Betty</hi> behav'd as Girls naturally do on the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0558800101:109"/>
Occaſion. My Lady had made her a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of genteel <hi>plain Cloaths;</hi> and her good Complexion Shape and Size, made her a very deſirable Object. Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> look'd, and ſeem'd to think her a Subject <hi>worth handling.</hi>—When the Ceremony, and the uſual Compliments were over, my Lord declar'd his Intention of giving the Pariſh to Mr. <hi>Caſſock,</hi> on the Death of Doctor <hi>Canter.</hi>—This was a <hi>Comment</hi> on the <hi>Text,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> had not known before; and, as it perfectly agreed with his Way of Thinking, he look'd on the <hi>Author</hi> as a very <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> Man.—The Truth is, he was ſo ſtruck with my Lord's Bounty, that neither he nor his Bride could return their Thank but by their humble Obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances.</p>
               <p>MY Lord had ſtill in Reſerve what was to complete the Reward of Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi>'s Fidelity.—He firſt beſtow'd many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments on him before all the Company, and then added, —<q>When my Boys are ſettled at Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s School, my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and I purpoſe ſtaying for ſome Time in <hi>England.</hi> You will then, Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> be ſo good to audit the Accounts of my Receivers, and take the Charge and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of my <hi>Charity Children.</hi> You and the young Couple muſt keep this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0558800101:110"/>
Houſe warm in my Abſence; and, that the Roof may be always in good Order, and to defray the Expences attending your Increaſe of Buſineſs, I deſire you will charge me with one hundred Pounds a Year extraordinary; and now, Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> give me Leave to regard you as my <hi>Companion</hi> and my <hi>Friend.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A PROFOUND Silence enſu'd, till the <hi>old Man,</hi> finding his Tongue, he pour'd out whatever his <hi>grateful</hi> Heart ſuggeſted, and ending in moſt fervent Prayers, retir'd in Haſte, to give his Tears of Joy full Scope. —At Dinner he was pretty chearful; and <hi>Mirth, Good-humour</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> admir'd <hi>Bounty-Hall,</hi> and reſided there.</p>
               <p>As I am call'd another Way, it cannot be expected I ſhould wait on this Company the whole Evening, much leſs pretend to conduct Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> and his <hi>Bride</hi> to that <hi>Theatre,</hi> where we are ſuffer'd to ſee the <hi>Actors,</hi> but by the Reflection of <hi>Fancy.</hi>— Let it ſuffice to ſay, that the young Lady was next Morning Mrs. <hi>Caſſock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much has been ſaid of this <hi>noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> that I fear ſome will be apt to ſuſpect my Veracity.—<hi>Envy</hi> will poſitively aſſert, that the Characters are <hi>abſurd, unnatural,</hi> and without a <hi>Precedent.—Ill-naure</hi> will diſcover the <hi>Sarcaſm,</hi> in placing in full
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0558800101:111"/>
View, what the <hi>Nobility</hi> ought <hi>truly to be,</hi> in Oppoſition to what ſome <hi>really</hi> are.— The Thought of ſuch <hi>ſcandalous</hi> Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, determines me to quit <hi>Bounty-Hall,</hi> and ſhift the Scene.</p>
               <p>'Tis neceſſary to inform my Readers, that Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> who I am now going to viſit, is the <hi>Clergyman</hi> that was a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to my Lord in his Travels.—During their Stay at <hi>Paris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> became acquainted with Madam <hi>Bonfoy,</hi> the Widow of a Captain who had been kill'd in the Service. She had ſollicited for a Penſion; but, being known to be a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> could never obtain it. As ſhe had two thouſand Livres a Year on the Town-Houſe of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and the Intereſt of ſome Money, ſhe kept genteel Apartments, and liv'd in a very decent Manner with her <hi>Niece,</hi> who was about four Years old.</p>
               <p>THE Temper of Madam <hi>Bonfoy</hi> was ſo like Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s, an Inclination for each other enſu'd, which <hi>ended,</hi> or rather <hi>increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> in Matrimony.—My Lord got him a good Living in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but afterwards advis'd him to exchange for one of leſs Value near <hi>Portarlington,</hi> in the <hi>King's County,</hi> inhabited moſtly by <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> and where little of any other Language was ſpoken. My Lord gave
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0558800101:112"/>
him the Plan of a <hi>School,</hi> which, by Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s good Management, could not fail of being extremely advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to them. Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> had now been in that Situation near four Years, and met with great Approbation, as he had Talents peculiar to that Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>MASTER <hi>Harry</hi> was now twelve Years of Age, and all Things were preparing for the Journey of the three Boys. Every one in the Family began to dread the Loſs of ſuch Children, who, by a thouſand little Pranks, were extremely dear to them. Miſs <hi>Harriot</hi> began to pine and cry, that ſhe was to loſe her Brothers, and her Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>little Jack.</hi> In ſhort, it is impoſſible to expreſs the ſilent Grief that reign'd in the Houſe.</p>
               <p>MR. KINDLY took up whole Days in preaching to <hi>Jack,</hi> and giving him good Advice.—<q>Perhaps, my dear Child, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I may never ſee you again; if ſo, mind my Words, and I ſhall be always preſent with you, and ſhield you from thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils the World is full of. If you <hi>deſpiſe</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> them, depend upon it, <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> and <hi>Misfortunes</hi> will attend you. That my Counſel may not be forgotten, I have wrote it down, and put it in your Trunk, that you may read, and get it by

Heart. They are the ſame Inſtructions I gave to my own Sons when they went from me, and, in general, will anſwer your Purpoſes. I have likewiſe, <hi>continued he,</hi> put up a good Store of Paper and Pens, and I inſiſt on your Writing fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to me, with a particular Account how the young Gentlemen behave, and how you employ your Time.</q>—<hi>Jack</hi> cry'd moſt heartily, and faithfully promis'd to obey all his Commands, and be a good <hi>Boy.</hi>—The Children took Leave of the Neighbours, but <hi>Jack,</hi> in a very tender and particular Manner, took <hi>his</hi> of Mrs. <hi>Long</hi> and the good-natur'd <hi>Groom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Coach and Servants were prepared, and the young Travellers were to ſet out next Morning with my Lord and Mr. <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock.</hi> Her Ladyſhip being with Child, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her being of the Party.</p>
               <p>THE Morning came, and the Horſes were ordered to be put too.—Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> took <hi>Jack</hi> in his Hand to the Office, and, ſhewing him his little Effects in a ſmall Trunk he had provided, put therein a Purſe, ſaying,—<q>
                     <hi>Jack,</hi> here is all your Money, with ſome Intereſt, amounting to <hi>Fifteen</hi> Guineas. I know you will take great Care and keep it, till you really want it. You are no <hi>Fool,</hi> my Dear, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0558800101:114"/>
he muſt be the greateſt Fool that ſpends his Money idly.</q>—<hi>Jack</hi> gave him his Word, he ſhould find it all when he came back.—<q>Yeſterday, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> I told you I might never ſee you more. I have, this ſmall Box to give you as my laſt Legacy. It contains a Book, that in Time you may read; but as I know you <hi>love Truth,</hi> I muſt have your Promiſe never to open it, but at the Time I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</q>—<hi>Jack</hi> fell on his Knees, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd him, he would never open it, if he order'd.—<q>Then, <hi>ſaid the old Man,</hi> mind what I ſay: I lay my Commands on you, never to open this Box, except you be reduced to the greateſt Neceſſity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt want Bread.</q>—So ſaying, he lock'd it in the Trunk, and gave <hi>Jack</hi> the Key. —<q>Now <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> I have but one Word more to ſay:—If <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>proſper</hi> you in the World, and your Heart ſhould ſwell with <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogance,</hi> remember that <hi>Drawer,</hi> and correct thoſe <hi>Vices.</hi>
                  </q>—Pray, Sir. <hi>ſaid Jack,</hi> what is in that Drawer?—'You ſhall ſee,' <hi>ſaid Kindly,</hi> and, producing his <hi>old red Waiſtcoat, tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Shirt</hi> and <hi>Breeches,</hi> ſaid,—<q>This, <hi>Jack,</hi> is your <hi>Original,</hi> ſo judge if <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haughtineſs</hi> will agree with ſuch a Dreſs.</q>—The Boy bluſh'd, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0558800101:115"/>
Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi>'s Waiſt, aſſur'd him, he would always remember the <hi>Drawer</hi> and the <hi>Dog-Kennel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY now join'd the Children, whom they found in Tears, having juſt quitted her Ladyſhip. <hi>Jack</hi> was ſent in by my Lord, and on his Knees, moſt humbly thank'd her Ladyſhip for all her Goodneſs to him.—The parting with her Sons made her ſcarcely able to ſpeak, but ſhe bid him mind his Buſineſs, and <hi>ſerve God.</hi> —She could utter no more, but with a tender Embrace let him depart.</p>
               <p>THE Servants had their Turn, and the Boys were almoſt hugg'd to Death.—With great Difficulty they quitted this moving Scene, and the Coach driving off, were followed by the Prayers and Bleſſings of a thouſand of the poor Inhabitants.</p>

               <p>THE Occurrences on the Road are not worth mentioning; but my Lord and Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> gave the Lads a good Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their new Maſter, and explain'd the Rules and Cuſtoms of the School. Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> was prepar'd for their Reception, and thank'd my Lord for the Honour he did him. After Supper, my Lord and Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> went to private Lodgings. The two Brothers had a Chamber to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and <hi>Jack</hi> had a ſmall one near the Back-Stairs at the End of the Gallery.</p>
               <p>BEFORE Eight next Morning, my Lord and Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> went to Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s. All the Scholars had not yet made their Appearance; but the Bell ringing, the reſt ſoon were in the School, where Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> and the Family attended my Lord,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0558800101:117"/>
when all were ſeated, one of the <hi>Lads</hi> mounted a Deſk, and with great Reverence began the <hi>Morning</hi> Service of the <hi>Church;</hi> another read the <hi>Leſſons</hi> of the Day; Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> the Uſher, rais'd the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the firſt Boy finiſh'd the <hi>Prayers,</hi> except the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.—This over, an Hour was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in examining their Exerciſes, and giving others for the following Day, and then they retir'd to Breakfaſt.</p>
               <p>MY Lord was again conducted to School, when one of the moſt <hi>ingenious</hi> of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen aſcended the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and made a <hi>Latin Oration</hi> on the <hi>Riſe of Nobility.</hi> He very artfully inſinuated, how happy ſome <hi>Families</hi> were, in always leaving Heirs to their <hi>Virtues</hi> as well as their <hi>Titles;</hi> and, that he could point out, even in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Days, a <hi>living</hi> Example of that <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> were he at Liberty to ſpeak, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſuſpected of <hi>Flattery;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that tho' many <hi>Patricians</hi> were a Scandal to their <hi>own</hi> and every <hi>other Order,</hi> yet ſome were always found who added a <hi>Luſtre</hi> to the <hi>Dignity,</hi> as their Lives were an <hi>Ornament</hi> to human Nature, and their <hi>Actions</hi> the Glory of their <hi>Fellow-Citizens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN this Gentleman had finiſh'd, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mounted, and made a ſhort Speech in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0558800101:118"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on the <hi>Happineſs of a good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which he compar'd to a <hi>tender Plant,</hi> under the Management of a ſkilful <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who not only made it bear <hi>exquiſite Fruit,</hi> but gave the Branches ſuch an <hi>elegant</hi> Turn, as added a <hi>Beauty</hi> to the Place, and a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> to the Eye.</p>
               <p>HIS Lordſhip was extremely pleas'd with this Entertainment, but particularly with the diſtinct, emphatical and graceful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they pronounced their Words. He was not wanting in returning his Thanks to the young Gentlemen, and, giving the Uſher <hi>Ten Guineas,</hi> begg'd he would be ſo good to buy a Dozen <hi>Bows and Arrows,</hi> and erect two <hi>Butts</hi> in the next Field, which would not only agreeably entertain them, but be a moſt healthful Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>HIS Lordſhip then gave ſome private Directions to Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Boys to the Care of his Wife, took a moſt tender Leave, and return'd to <hi>Bounty-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I MUST continue at <hi>Portarlington-School</hi> above three Years. If my Reader pleaſes, I ſhall indulge his reſiding with me, and making all the Remarks and Applications his Underſtanding may ſuggeſt. Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt furniſh him with the many <hi>Pranks</hi> and <hi>Tricks</hi> School-Boys are wont to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0558800101:119"/>
play, as I am not at Leiſure, at preſent, to entertain him in that Manner. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine myſelf to the narrow Compaſs of hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Conduct of this School, as there is ſomewhat <hi>peculiar</hi> in it, and what I could wiſh every other had a <hi>Part</hi> of, if not the <hi>Whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MR. JOHNSTON was a Gentleman of very extenſive Knowledge, great Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Temper, chearful and eaſy in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and, above all, knew <hi>Mankind</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> perfectly well. As he had Talents peculiar for <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in it, ſo his <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding</hi> convinc'd him, that rearing up <hi>good</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> Members of Society, was the <hi>moſt honourable</hi> Employment of Man.</p>
               <p>HIS Houſe could hold but twenty-five Youths, and each paid <hi>thirty Pounds</hi> a Year. When his Conduct was known, it is not to be imagined what <hi>Intereſt</hi> was made by Gentlemen, to have their Sons admitted, on a Vacancy.</p>
               <p>HIS firſt Care was the inculcating into his Pupils, the Principles of <hi>true Religion,</hi> as the ſureſt Foundation on which to build the <hi>moral Virtues.</hi> His next, was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring into them, a <hi>certain</hi> Proportion of <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>temporal Happineſs,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating, that <hi>Learning, Honour,</hi> and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0558800101:120"/>
                  <hi>Integrity</hi> were the moſt probable, if not the <hi>only Way,</hi> to attain them. For theſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, they conſtantly attended <hi>Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> at Church and at Home: He made them read the <hi>Prayers</hi> alternately, and, as Occaſions requir'd, gave hiſtorical Accounts to explain or illuſtrate ſome Paſſages in the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>—He always treated them, not as Children, but as <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> which made them endeavour to act as ſuch. If ſome were negligent of their Duty, he ſeem'd concern'd at it, and pity'd the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Youth,</hi> that forgot himſelf ſo much as to undo, by a voluntary Neglect, all that his Anceſtors had acquir'd by <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Induſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE took great Pains to give them an early Habit of <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Good Manners;</hi> and, by his own Practice, convinc'd them how agreeable ſuch a Conduct was to every Man. He always ſpoke with a <hi>Bow,</hi> and Marks of Reſpect, and encouraged them to act in the like Manner to each other. He ſhew'd them, by ſundry <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>comic</hi> Examples, the Uſe and Beauty of <hi>Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and the Abſurdity and bad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a <hi>clowniſh</hi> and <hi>brutiſh</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
               <p>THE Mornings were given to School Learning, in which, by his Skilfulneſs and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0558800101:121"/>
Aſſiduity, they made great Progreſs. As to fix'd <hi>Holidays,</hi> they were Strangers; but when all the Lads were perfect in their different Leſſons, Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd them Thanks, and then added,— <q>This is very clever.—I find, Gentlemen, you have taken more than ordinary Pains; but I am ſo far from deſiring too much <hi>Study,</hi> that, <hi>pleaſe God,</hi> if To morrow be a fine Day, we will take the Diverſion of <hi>Hunting</hi> or <hi>Fiſhing,</hi>—juſt, Gentlemen, as you pleaſe.</q>— Thus they could always command a Day of Amuſement; but that Lad paſs'd his Time very <hi>diſagreeably,</hi> who, by his <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> had ſtopp'd the Pleaſure of the reſt.</p>
               <p>THE Evenings, in ſome Degree, were their own, either to ſtudy in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or divert themſelves in the large Yard or Field. If the Weather did not permit the latter, Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> us'd to ſay,— <q>Well, Gentlemen, how ſhall we paſs our Time? I have a great Notion Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> can pronounce one of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Orations as well as Mr. <hi>Stevenſon.</hi>
                  </q>—Sometimes he pitch'd on one of <hi>Atterbury</hi>'s or <hi>Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Sermons; ſometimes on Speeches in <hi>Tacitus</hi> or <hi>Livy;</hi> ſometimes on <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Debates,</hi> and ſometimes on <hi>Milton,</hi> or on occaſional Pieces of Poetry, of Beauty and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0558800101:122"/>
Elegance.—The Reader always mounted the Pulpit; but if he err'd from the <hi>right</hi> Pronounciation and <hi>true</hi> Meaning of the Author, or leſſen'd the Senſe by <hi>falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>too languid</hi> a Delivery, Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> begg'd his Pardon, and deſir'd to be permitted to ſhew, wherein <hi>he thought</hi> it might be utter'd more to the Satisfaction of the Audience.—He then took his Place, and diſplay'd the Orator.—His <hi>determin'd</hi> and <hi>reſolute</hi> Voice, ſtirr'd their young Blood; but when he <hi>ſoftened</hi> into <hi>Pity</hi> at ſome Diſtreſs, it caught the Lads, and their Countenances ſhew'd it.</p>
               <p>HE thought it abſolutely neceſſary that a young Man ſhould be acquainted with the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his <hi>own Country,</hi> at leaſt as ſoon as that of <hi>Egypt, Greece,</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi> This was a fix'd Entertainment twice a Week; and his Comments, Obſervations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the different Parts, were adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe he made them to, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomewhat that ſhew'd the Value of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the Danger in not putting <hi>proper Bounds</hi> to it.—The Effects of <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion;</hi>—the Nature of <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi>—the Obligation of a <hi>King</hi> to his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and his <hi>Subjects</hi> to him;—the Happineſs of a <hi>good Monarch,</hi> with the <hi>Infamy</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment</hi> due to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0558800101:123"/>
thoſe, who <hi>wantonly</hi> attempt to diſturb the Peace of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and the Peace of the <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OF a chearful Evening Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> has propos'd the Repetition of a good <hi>Comedy;</hi> but, as he did not conceive that acting a Play was of Uſe to Youth, he placed them in their Seats, and aſſign'd them their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts, which they read from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Copies. The Comedies he generally choſe were <hi>Steele</hi>'s, <hi>Farquhar</hi>'s, and ſome of <hi>Cibber</hi>'s, as they not only had Wit and Humour, but a certain <hi>Moral</hi> in them, not to be found in <hi>Congreve, Wycherly, Dryden,</hi> or <hi>Vanbrugh,</hi> but by wading through <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenity.</hi>—If the Gentlemen choſe a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> he made them carefully obſerve the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a <hi>paſſionate</hi> Utterance, and <hi>Ranting,</hi> and between the <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> Manner of Expreſſion, and the <hi>Whining,</hi> and gave them Examples himſelf.</p>
               <p>BUT the moſt favourite Manner he had of entertaining them, becauſe he had a Scheme in it, was giving ſhort and pleaſing Accounts of the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>great Men</hi> of all Nations.—The <hi>Conqueror</hi> and <hi>Captive.</hi>— The <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> of his People. —The <hi>Law giver</hi> and the <hi>Incendiary.</hi>— The <hi>Patriot,</hi> and the <hi>Pretenders</hi> to Patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.—The <hi>Orator</hi> and the <hi>Declaimer.</hi>—The <hi>Divine.</hi>—The <hi>Lawyer.</hi>—The <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0558800101:124"/>
Philoſopher.</hi>—The <hi>Botaniſt.— Phyſician,</hi> and the <hi>Merchant.</hi>—The many Profeſſions that ſpring from theſe <hi>Fountains,</hi> were at different Times ſet in proper and clear Lights.—Their <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Uſes</hi> to Society, or the <hi>Abuſes</hi> of Power and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> were touch'd, ſo as not to deſcend too deeply into the <hi>Sciences;</hi> but to fix the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Lads, and give him an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of diſcovering the <hi>Bent</hi> of their Inclinations and Geniuſes.</p>
               <p>SUCH a Conduct, he thought as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a Part of the <hi>Duty</hi> of a Maſter, as teaching them <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> and he never fail'd communicating his Diſcoveries to their Parents.</p>
               <p>HAPPY had it been for many Gentlemen, if their Genius had been properly attended to in their Youth!—The many Abſurdities in the World would be avoided, and each have the Rank the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd them.—The <hi>Martial Spirit</hi> would not be compell'd to expoſe himſelf in a Pulpit.—The tender and meek Mind would not be drove to the Field of Buſtle and Slaughter.—The Phyſician would not preſcribe at the Bar, nor the Lawyer admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Phyſick by Act of Parliament. — Each would be in their juſt Point of View,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0558800101:125"/>
and each have a fair Opportunity of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>AS Nature gives not equal Talents to all, this good Maſter made proper Allowances: He was never diſpleas'd at one Gentleman's being leſs apt to learn than another, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he found him equally diligent: On the contrary, he encourag'd and indulg'd him, and frequently ſtole into his Room at Night, and gave him half an Hour's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Inſtruction for the Buſineſs of next Day, but inſiſted on its being kept ſecret from the reſt.</p>
               <p>SELDOM was their Book an Occaſion of Chaſtiſement, but they never were excuſed for any vicious Act. When he found a Lad of an obſtinate ſullen Temper, who deſpis'd Learning, good Advice, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, he ſent him home to his Friends. —On ſuch Occaſions he always made a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic Speech to the School, and placed the unhappy Boy ſeparate from the reſt.— When he was to depart, Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> walk'd with him to the Gate, and all the Gentlemen follow'd with profound Silence. Here he embrac'd him and took his Leave, praying God that this gentle Admonition might make him reflect in Time, and change his Conduct, ſo as to be an Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and not a Diſcredit to Society.—Then,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0558800101:126"/>
in a ceremonious Manner, all the reſt took a melancholy Farewel.</p>
               <p>AMONGST the many Advantages of this Seminary, Mrs. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> and her Niece <hi>Nannett</hi> contributed in improving the Boys in <hi>French;</hi> and, as all the Inhabitants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpoke it, they acquired that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage with great Facility.—Some Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, when Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, his Wife has extremely diverted and amuſed them by <hi>Molier</hi>'s Comedies, <hi>Gil-Blas, Scaron,</hi> and other Books of that Tendency.</p>
               <p>THUS did this good Family look on themſelves as Parents to the Children, and the Children regarded them as ſuch.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and profitable Entertainment were ſo agreeably and nicely blended, that the one was never ſuffered to become tedious and irkſome, nor the other to cloy or fill the Mind too much.</p>

               <p>AS <hi>Jack Connor</hi> was not intended for a perfect Scholar, Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s Care on that Account was not ſo exact as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lads; but what regarded the moral and ſocial Duties, he received in common with them. In the three Years at this School, he had acquir'd a good Share of <hi>Latin</hi> and ſome <hi>Greek,</hi> but his chief Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was in Reading, and making Extracts of uſeful and entertaining Paſſages from Hiſtory, Voyages, Poetry, and the like, of which Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> had a good Collection always open to the Gentlemen. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him in Writing, made ſtrong Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on his Mind, and gave him a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and a genteel and eaſy Turn of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that much better Scholars are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0558800101:128"/>
to. He ſpoke <hi>French</hi> with great Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, for Mademoiſelle <hi>Nannett</hi> took ſome Pains to perfect him in it, and as he had a charming Voice, ſhe taught him many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable <hi>French</hi> Songs.</p>
               <p>HE was now in the Spring of Life, tall and well made. Health, Beauty, and Sprightlineſs were always preſent with him, and Mirth and Joy danc'd in his Eyes. Theſe, and his little Accompliſhments, made him careſs'd by all, and were ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that even Madam <hi>Johnſton</hi> has been frequently heard to ſay, <q>Ma Foy, c'eſt un beau Garçon!—Voila de quoi faire un Joli Homme!</q>—If <hi>Nannett</hi> was ſilent, ſhe looked, and perhaps thought the more.—<hi>The Dial ſpoke not, but it made ſhrewd Signs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Juice of the Grape is inſipid, nor can yield a Spirit till <hi>fermented.</hi> In this State, the Veſſel muſt be pierc'd, and a Vent given to the jarring Particles, or it will burſt its Tenement.—The Hand of Experience knows when to ſtop this Chaſm, —to fine it down, and give it the proper Time to acquire a Mellowneſs and Flavour that gladdens the Heart of Man, and adds Chearfulneſs and good Humour to every rational Company.—If Ignorance inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0558800101:129"/>
in the Management, the Wine will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſour, and of little or no Value.</p>
               <p>IS there not ſomewhat of a fermenting Quality in human Nature? Or rather, is it not certain that there is?—Without this Fermentation, which the Paſſions only can give, Man would be but a moving Statue. 'Tis the <hi>Paſſions</hi> that open his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—They lay the Plan of all his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—They conduct him firſt to Objects of Pleaſure, and then branch out his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to Glory—Honour—Riches. They poliſh him, and raiſe a Deſire of lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of being loved.—In a Word, they alone, when juſtly guided, can make him a rational Creature.—If unheeded, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to take an unnatural Bent, neither Fame nor Honour can reſult from them, and the Man becomes the Peſt of Society inſtead of the Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>OUR little Hero was not form'd without theſe Paſſions. If from Inexperience, they ſometimes hurry'd him into imprudent Acts, and brought him into dangerous Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations, he was the firſt to cenſure his own Conduct, and recur inſtantly to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples imbib'd in his Youth.—Of what Uſe theſe <hi>Paſſions</hi> and theſe <hi>Principles</hi> were to him, is too much a Part of this Hiſtory, to be omitted in their proper Place.—
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0558800101:130"/>
Since, therefore, it is impoſſible for me to act the impartial Hiſtorian, and omit the Conſequences of theſe <hi>Paſſions,</hi> I hope the candid Reader will excuſe the ſeeming <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> of this Chapter.—My <hi>Hero</hi> is not a <hi>perfect Hero.</hi>—He is young, and without Experience. He has the Seeds of <hi>Man</hi> in him, and conſequently is faulty. Beſides, as his whole Life turns on this Incident, I am compell'd to inſert it, but hope the <hi>Moral</hi> will excuſe the <hi>Tale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Time was now come when <hi>Jack</hi> was to be tempted, and unwarily to yield. When he became <hi>criminal,</hi> he became <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</hi>—Of late he took a particular Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in <hi>Nannett</hi>'s Company, and ſhe, in Return, treated him with great Freedom, and with ſomewhat more than mere Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance. His Years prevented his ſeeing the ſecret Motives of her Kindneſs. He was happy, becauſe ſhe was fond of him; but her Fondneſs aroſe from a different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.—She lov'd.</p>
               <p>How far this Paſſion will extend itſelf, few are unacquainted, and poor <hi>Nannett</hi> practis'd every female Wile to gain a Heart invincible to her Charms, only from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Often has ſhe told him, <hi>he ought, at his Age, to avoid bluſhing when he ſpoke to her, and be more a Man, than to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0558800101:131"/>
at touching her Hand.</hi>—Theſe and many other forcible Expreſſions ſhe has reiterated, and ſometimes even kiſs'd him, but they only ſerv'd to give him a ſecret uneaſy Pleaſure, and a conſtant Deſire of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, without a Knowledge of the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—She remark'd his confus'd Behaviour, and found, ſhe muſt either renounce all Shame, by ſpeaking in direct Terms, or abſolutely avoid him.—The Delicacy of her Sex as much forbid the one, as her violent Love did the other.</p>
               <p>HER Invention was on the Rack, but at aſt ſhe remember'd a certain <hi>French</hi> Book, where a Lady is placed exactly in her Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this dear Volume ſhe turn'd, and determin'd to try the Experiment. She found Opportunities to oblige <hi>Jack</hi> to read moſt Part of it to her, but defer'd the Lecture of the intereſting Scene, till the firſt Day Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> and the Lads went a Hunting. That Time ſoon came, and the Evening before ſhe whiſper'd him, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void being of the Party, and they would fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that charming Story. He with Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſenting, ſhe told him how inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient it would be to read in his little Room, <q>but, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> as ſoon as they are all gone, if you will promiſe to be very ſecret, and make no Noiſe, you may come to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0558800101:132"/>
my Chamber, and we can read at our Eaſe.</q>—He promis'd, and this Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ended.</p>
               <p>IT was now <hi>June,</hi> and being fine Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all were ready for the Sport of the Field at Four in the Morning. <hi>Jack</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd himſelf to Maſter <hi>Harry,</hi> on Account of a Book he was to finiſh, and a Letter to write to Mr. <hi>Kindly;</hi> and, ſlily ſlipping up into his Room, remain'd there till he ſaw them all at ſome Diſtance. With cautious Steps he quietly mounted the Back-Stairs, and found <hi>Nannett</hi>'s Chamber Door on a Jarr ready to admit him. His Treading was not ſo light, but her attentive Ear heard him, and putting the Curtain back, in a low Voice ſhe cry'd,—<q>Lord bleſs me, <hi>Jack!</hi> Who would have expected you ſo early?—I thought to have been up and dreſs'd, and now you ſurpriſe a-body in Bed. Indeed I am quite aſham'd of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,—but—ſhut the Door, and ſit down ſoftly.</q>—She then open'd the Curtain a little more, and <hi>Jack</hi> ſat at ſome Diſtance. A Silence enſu'd for ſome Minutes, till at laſt he ventur'd to ſay ſomething of the Book.—<q>Well, ſaid <hi>Nannett,</hi> look for it under my Pillow, and I'll read.</q>—<hi>Jack</hi> ſearch'd for ſome Time, but in vain; and, ſhe calling him an aukward Fellow, roſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0558800101:133"/>
careleſly and ſoon found it.—Undoubtedly ſhe had no Intention of expoſing to his View her lovely Neck; for, no ſooner had ſhe caught his Eyes fix'd on that Part, and ſaw the Tumult it occaſion'd in him, than with great Precipitation ſhe cover'd it.— Her Head was once more laid on her Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the Book in her Hand.—<q>If, ſaid ſhe, you keep ſo far off, you can't hear me, and you had better come and ſit on the Bed-ſide.</q>—The poor Boy, willing to oblige, carefully mov'd, but found her right Arm negligently thrown out. This Impediment he gently remov'd, but not before he had frequently kiſs'd it. She call'd him a Fool, but her good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not forbid this Sort of Folly.</p>
               <p>JACK'S Spirits were up in Arms, ſo we muſt preſume he was going to ſit down improperly, otherwiſe ſhe certainly would not have ſaid—<q>Bleſs me!—Why ſure you an't ſo mad as to lie on the Bed;—But— if you are afraid your Shoes will make a Noiſe, and will abſolutely do it, can't you pull them off?</q>—His Shoes vaniſh'd in an Inſtant, and he placed himſelf where before he had no Intention.—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>COME, come, ſaid <hi>Nannett,</hi> let me make an End of my Story, but if you attempt to ſerve me, as <hi>Amyntor</hi> does his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0558800101:134"/>
                     <hi>Phillis,</hi> poſitively I ſhan't endure you,— but—here's one Kiſs more to keep you quiet.</q>—She then fix'd on the Page and began.—<q>Thus ſituated were this happy Pair. Silence and Secrecy reign'd, and no Eyes to witneſs their Joys, but thoſe of laughing Cupids, who hover'd round the inchanting Bower. <hi>Amyntor</hi> was all Deſire and Love, but his invincible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, oblig'd the equally enamour'd <hi>Phillis</hi> to ſupply by Management, what her Tongue could not utter. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly conducted him to the Beginning of Charms, to which the Youth was an abſolute Stranger.</q>— <hi>Nannett</hi> continued to read, and, with great Judgment, laid the proper Emphaſis on every Word; but at every tender or delicate Period, as many ſuch there were, <hi>Jack</hi> became an exact Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, and frequently interrupted the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. She often wonder'd at his Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and declar'd her Anger, but her Countenance did not ſeem to imply that Paſſion, and at laſt ſhe was permitted to continue.—<q>Too preſſing <hi>Amyntor,</hi> too yielding <hi>Phillis!</hi>—The Time, the Place, and every Opportunity conſpir'd with their mutual Inclinations.—A thouſand Dalliances interven'd, 'till Prudence,— Virtue,—and <hi>Phillis</hi> were loſt.</q>

               <p>THE Clock ſtruck Seven, which rous'd them from their Dream of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to think on their Safety. <hi>Nannett</hi> was unwilling to part; but <hi>Jack,</hi> now <hi>more prudent,</hi> took an haſty Kiſs or two, and got to his Room unperceiv'd. He now began to reflect on his Conduct, and he judg'd himſelf greatly criminal. He now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi>'s Precepts, which had for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0558800101:136"/>
ſome Time been neglected, and call'd to Mind his laſt Words of <hi>Calamity</hi> and <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,</hi> if he departed from <hi>Virtue.</hi> Theſe Thoughts gave him extreme Uneaſineſs, but he found himſelf greatly reliev'd by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to be guilty no more, and to ſhun the Object. An unuſual Gravity attended him the whole Day, which greatly diſturb'd <hi>Nannett,</hi> as he gave her no Opportunity of inquiring into the Reaſon.</p>
               <p>HE was extremely pleas'd with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over himſelf, but alas! he little knew his own Heart; and, as he was a Stranger to the Ways of <hi>Men,</hi> how could he poſſibly know that of <hi>Women?—Nannett,</hi> impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to learn what paſſed in his Soul, waited in her Chamber till Two in the Morning, not doubting but <hi>Jack</hi> would find his Way there. The Diſappointment extremely mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd her Pride; however, ſhe determin'd at all Events, to have her Doubts <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> and reſolutely ventur'd down, and got to his Bed-ſide. She prevented a Noiſe on his awaking, by telling her Name, and as ſhe was undreſs'd, without more Ceremony ſlipp'd in, and took him in her Arms.</p>
               <p>WHERE now were all his mighty Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions?—Where were all Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi>'s mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Leſſons?—Vaniſh'd,—Loſt in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the Night, and in the Arms of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0558800101:137"/>
Youth and Beauty!—She made him many tender Reproaches, but her Love forgave all.—His Reflections that Day were quite of another Complexion to the former, and he even thought himſelf a <hi>Fool,</hi> for being more timorous than a <hi>Girl.</hi> Beſides, he argu'd the Impoſſibility of Danger, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcover'd; and, that if it was a Crime, he at moſt, was anſwerable but for <hi>Half;</hi> but the ſtrongeſt Reaſon for continuing this Affair was, that he believed every Man would do the ſame, had he the ſame Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.—Thus, his Underſtanding was quite defeated by, what he thought, good Reaſon.—How many are there, who, by ſuch fallacious Arguments, perſuade, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſuade themſelves into Evil, even contrary to their real Opinion? And how many are there, who are but too ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in their Attempts to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
               <p>HIS Amour went charmingly on for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix Weeks, nor could there be, in his Imagination, an happier Mortal.—He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly dropt all boyiſh Amuſements, and was much leſs punctual and exact at School, than formerly. His Viſage began to change, and the Roſes in his Cheeks to fade; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that <hi>Madam Johnſton</hi> really thought him out of Order, and very innocently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0558800101:138"/>
                  <hi>Nannett</hi> to take ſome Care of the poor Boy, and give him <hi>ſomething warm,</hi> when he was in Bed. <hi>Nannett</hi> moſt punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obey'd her Commands, but <hi>Jack</hi> grew paler notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHNSTON, at laſt, obſerv'd an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in <hi>Jack,</hi> and, for ſome Time, was of his Wife's Opinion; but, as Nothing could eſcape his Penetration, he perceiv'd that the Boy's Eyes ſparkl'd, and his Face had an uncommon Glow, whenever <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett</hi> enter'd the Room. He likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd a peculiar Pleaſure in their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, when they ſpoke to each other, and even when their Eyes chanc'd to meet, which they frequently did.—'Tis a Queſtion would puzzle <hi>Monſieur de Moivre,</hi> Whether moſt Intrigues were began, or were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by the <hi>Eyes?</hi> Certain it is, they are as apt to betray as ſeduce. If theſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Companions have a Language to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us into ſecret Deeds, they have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to divulge it.—What Pity it is, they are placed in ſo conſpicuous a Spot!</p>
               <p>MR. JOHNSTON in his Youth was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of this Language, and read in their Hearts, what gave him extreme Pain. He was tortur'd with ſuſpecting the worſt, and reaſon'd himſelf into the Conduct he was to obſerve, ſhould his Suſpicions be well
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0558800101:139"/>
grounded.—He knew, ſhould his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vent itſelf in Words, the <hi>Reputation</hi> of his <hi>Niece</hi> was loſt, and the Character of his School would ſuffer a ſevere Wound.— To chaſtiſe the Boy, would anſwer but the ſame End.—To join them in Marriage was ridiculous, and, to ſuffer them to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in Iniquity was impoſſible.—For two Days was he thus agitated, before he could fix on a Scheme to ſave all Appearances, but particularly thoſe that could affect his own Family.—When he had revolved his Plan, and taken a Reſolution, his next Step was to ſatisfy his eager Doubts.</p>
               <p>The third Morning, about Three o'Clock, he quietly ſtepp'd into <hi>Jack</hi>'s Room. He examined the Bed, which he founded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruffled and cold, and immediately conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jack</hi> was in a <hi>warmer Place.</hi> He pauſed for a few Minutes to ſtifle his Indignation, and let the Hurry of his Spirits ſubſide, and then quietly mounted to his <hi>Niece</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. He gently open'd the Curtain, and found the happy criminal Pair lock'd in each other's Arms, bidding Defiance to all worldly Cares, for they were faſt aſleep. —For ſome Time he gazed with Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſcarcely credited the Evidence of his Eyes.—At laſt he ſtirred <hi>Nannett,</hi> who wakened with a tender Expreſſion to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0558800101:140"/>
                  <hi>Jack;</hi> but when ſhe perceiv'd her <hi>Uncle,</hi> ſhe was juſt going to ſcream out, when he put his his Hand on her Mouth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her to make no Noiſe, but lie ſtill.— <hi>Jack</hi> now opened his Eyes, but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he beheld the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> he hid himſelf under the Cloaths.</p>
               <p>POOR <hi>Nannett</hi> put on a moſt ſupplicating Countenance, which her ready Tears great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted. Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> with as much Coolneſs as he could collect, firſt deſired her to pin her <hi>Tucker;</hi> and, <q>Now, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> Child, though you have been very fooliſh, yet I promiſe you, if you will keep your own Counſel, I ſhall do the ſame, and it ſhall for ever be a Secret, even from your Aunt.</q>—So much Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gave her new Life, and ſhe promiſed never more to tranſgreſs, and be all Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.—<q>Dry your Eyes, my Dear, ſaid he, you ſee I am not angry with you or <hi>Jack,</hi> ſo bid him get up and meet me in the Garden immediately; where we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult how to manage this ſilly Affair.</q>— When he was gone, <hi>Jack</hi> ventured to peep out, and was quite overjoyed to find Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> in ſuch good Humour, and much wonder'd at it. They were both extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed, and imagined they even had his Conſent to continue their agreeable Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0558800101:141"/>
—<hi>Jack</hi> ſoon dreſſed himſelf, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tender Leave of his dear <hi>Nannett,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to meet earlier the following Night; but alas! that Meeting never happened.</p>
               <p>JACK got to the Garden as directed, but trembled at Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s Approach, who, aſſuming a Smile, gave the Boy not a little Courage.—'Well, Sir, <hi>ſaid his Maſter,</hi> it ſeems you have lately paſſed your Time very chearfully, and turned over other Leaves beſides <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek;</hi> however, I am not now here to upbraid you with Ingratitude, or with the Breach of all Laws, Human and Divine; neither ſhall I now correct you, or ſend you to Priſon, and have you hang'd, as the Laws direct; but, as I ſhall always have it in my Power, ſo I ſhall certainly put it in Practice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will give me your moſt ſacred Promiſe, to do whatever I ſhall order.' —'Sir, <hi>ſaid Jack,</hi> with great Confuſion, I really don't know how to appear before God or you, after my Tranſgreſſions; but I hope my ſincere Repentance, with my moſt ſolemn Vow to obey all your Directions, will atone for my Crimes'— I know, reply'd Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor a Lye, therefore I will truſt you. The laſt Letters I received from my Lord particularly mention you, about a Project
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0558800101:142"/>
I had of ſending you to <hi>London,</hi> of which he has approved. Now, <hi>Jack,</hi> if you will ſet out this Day, in the Manner I ſhall direct, I will pardon all, and put you in a Way of making your Fortune.' —'Sir, reply'd <hi>Jack,</hi> (who was fired at going to <hi>London</hi>) I have already given you my Oath to obey, and, to convince you of my Readineſs, I am willing to ſet out this Minute.'</p>
               <p>
                  <q>IN the firſt Place, ſaid Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> I muſt inſiſt on your not ſpeaking a Syllable to <hi>Nannett,</hi> on any Account whatever, nor to any Perſon in the Family about what has happened. In the next Place, I deſire you will preſs me this Morning for Leave to viſit Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s Family, who have ſo often invited you.—Go that Road about a Mile, and then turn back through the Fields, which you know will, in about an Hour, lead you into the great Road to DUBLIN. On this Side the Windmill you will find my Man <hi>John</hi> with a Carr, who will have particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to take Care of you, and you will follow his Directions. As I know you will believe me, I give you my Word and Honour, that I intend only your own Good; but it is abſolutely neceſſary for your Peace and mine, that you promiſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0558800101:143"/>
punctually to obey my Orders, and that on no Account you will ever write your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or cauſe any other Perſon to write to my Lord, Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> or me. Theſe are the Conditions on which my Pardon is founded: If you tranſgreſs, be aſſur'd my utmoſt Renſentment will follow.</q>

               <p>JACK threw himſelf on his Knees, and moſt ſolemnly vow'd, in the Preſence of God, religiouſly to obſerve all his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and riſing, aſk'd his Maſter what he intended to do with his Shirts, Books, and his other little Effects? But being aſſur'd he ſhould find them all ſafe in <hi>Dublin,</hi> was quite eaſy on that Account.—<q>Now, ſaid Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> I am ſatisfy'd, and I hope you will have Reaſon to be content. Leſt you may want Money on the Road, here is a Guinea, and more will be given you in Town.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AS they walk'd towards the Houſe, Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> gave him many good Leſſons for his future Conduct.—He very earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended a modeſt, ſober, and religious Life, as what only could give him true Joy and real Happineſs.—He told him, that God ſometimes permitted Good to come out of Evil and pray'd it might be ſo in the preſent Caſe; but, that no Man ought to depend that ſuch a Grace would at all
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0558800101:144"/>
Times be beſtowed on us;—that, as the Mercy of God was great, ſo was his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy; equally capable of forgiving young raſh Sinners, as of puniſhing obſtinate and unrepenting Offenders.</p>
               <p>MUCH more was ſaid on this Subject, and in ſo tender a Manner, as greatly to affect the Boy, and make a ſtrong Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on his Mind. Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> concluded, with ſaying, <q>You have not much of the common <hi>Iriſh</hi> Manner of ſpeaking, but let me adviſe you to forget the little you have, and endeavour to ſpeak like the People you live with, which will prevent your being often laugh'd at, and ridicul'd by the Ignorant and Vulgar, and none other can do it.—Your Name is quite <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but I ſhall call you JOHN CONYERS, in my Letters, and henceforward let that be your Name. And now, Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> I think we have fully ſettled this Matter; therefore go in, and behave as uſual; but remember your Promiſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THEY got to the Houſe before any of the Servants were up, ſo their Meeting was a Secret.—When <hi>Jack</hi> was alone, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan very ſeriouſly to reflect on his Situation. He was conſcious of deſerving very ſevere Puniſhment, and thank'd God Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> had treated him ſo well.—On the other
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0558800101:145"/>
Hand, he regretted parting with his dear <hi>Nannett,</hi> eſpecially in the Manner he had promis'd, and had a violent Inclination to take one tender Farewel, but his Vow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him. The Injunctions laid on him, he thought very extraordinary; but the Dread of Puniſhment and Shame, and the Anger of my Lord and Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> made him acquieſce with Patience to theſe hard Terms. Beſides, as he really had an entire Confidence in, and a Love for Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> he doubted not but he had good Reaſons for what he ordered.</p>
               <p>THO' his Effects were to meet him in <hi>Dublin,</hi> he had the wiſe Precaution of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on two Shirts, and taking his Purſe, which now contained but eleven Guineas. He likewiſe put in his Coat Pocket the little Box and Inſtructions given him by Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> and all the little Manuſcripts he had. Thus dreſs'd, and fix'd in his Reſolutions, he waited on Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> and begged his Leave to viſit Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> who lived about four Miles to the Weſt.—Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated for ſome Time, but his Wife inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, ſhe obtained Permiſſion, provided he promiſed to go Half a Mile round, and not croſs the Ford which was ſometimes dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0558800101:146"/>IT ſeems Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> had given Orders to <hi>John</hi> to go that Morning with a Carr to <hi>Dublin</hi> for an Hogſhead of Wine; and, as he was an old faithful Servant, was the only Perſon he truſted with the Secret. He gave him his Inſtructions, and a Letter to his Brother, who was a Merchant of that City.—<hi>John</hi> had ſet out about Eight o'Clock, and <hi>Jack</hi> took a different Road about Nine. —He went off with tolerable Spirits; but, when he came to the appointed Turn, his Heart ſwelled, and the Thoughts of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Nannett,</hi> Maſter <hi>Harry, Billy,</hi> and all his dear Friends for ever, almoſt made him diſtracted, and obliged him to ſit down and give Way to a Torrent of Tears.—At laſt the Thoughts of ſeeing DUBLIN and LONDON, and the Hopes of making his <hi>Fortune,</hi> throwing his Situation into a more favourable Light, he found Strength to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and joyned old <hi>John</hi> about Eleven o'Clock.—The Man was prepared for him; and, under the Pretence of keeping him from the Sun, ſeated him on a Bundle of Straw on the Carr, and cover'd him with a Sort of Awning, ſo cloſe, that no Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers could ſee him, and then march'd on to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where he was well received by the Merchant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0558800101:147"/>PERHAPS the good-natured Reader may be deſirous of knowing what paſſed at <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arlington</hi> when <hi>Jack</hi> was miſſed, and how <hi>Nannett</hi> and the Family behaved on this melancholy Occaſion; and ſorry I am, that it is not in my Power to gratify ſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Curioſity. He may, if he pleaſes, ſuppoſe with me, that they ſent next Day to Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s, and that their Surprize was great, when inform'd they had not ſeen or heard of him. No doubt, many were their Conjectures; ſome, I imagine, thought he had run away; but I apprehend the moſt probable and general Surmiſe was, that in croſſing the Ford he was drown'd.</p>
               <p>BE this as it will, I muſt, tho' with ſome Regret, leave this good Family, and follow my Friend JACK CONYERS through Scenes of a much different Nature.—The calm, tranquil Life he has hitherto led, muſt give Place to the <hi>Hurry</hi> and <hi>Buſtle</hi> of the World. —<hi>Deceit, Craft, Flattery</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> muſt ſucceed to Leſſons of <hi>Honour, Probity</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi>

               <p>HAPPY that <hi>Being,</hi> who ſometimes permits himſelf to think ſeriouſly; who ſuffers his Imagination deliberately to reflect on external Objects, and internally apply thoſe Leſſons of Morality, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that may be drawn from every Action of Man—<hi>Vice</hi> trails with it thoſe Marks, that ſhew us its <hi>Odiouſneſs,</hi> as ſome poiſonous Animals carry their Antidote.— Affluence and Plenty are not generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of ſuch Thoughts; for, in that Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, we are apt to look no farther than ourſelves, nor conceive the Poſſibility of being wretched and unhappy, till we have experienced ſome of its Bitters.—There is a pleaſing and a uſeful Senſation, in the Soul, at viewing and commiſerating the Diſtreſſes of the Unfortunate. The more we have pitied and raiſed our <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to others, the happier we find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> and <hi>Penury,</hi> viſit us

To abandon and be abandon'd by thoſe Friends he had ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely loved—To live amongſt Strangers in a diſtant Country, and to begin to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and work for the Bread he was to eat, were to him moſt dreadful Viciſſitudes of Fortune; and what he imagin'd, were peculiar to himſelf. In theſe gloomy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, he acknowledged his manifold Offences, and in his fervent Prayers, which had lately been neglected, moſt heartily begg'd Forgiveneſs. He read Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi>'s Inſtructions to his Son, over and over, and made the propereſt Obſervations on them in his Power.</p>
               <p>AS I have now ſome ſpare Time, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better employ'd, than laying before my Reader the Inſtructions ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.—Should he be wiſe enough not to ſtand in Need of theſe Precepts, I beg he will paſs them over, and ſkip on to the mere Narration.</p>

                     <p>WHEN you reflect on the Relation I bare to you, and on my Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Affection, you muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that all my Care and Pains is to endeavour to make, and perhaps ſee you an happy and a worthy Man.—You are now to begin a new Scene of Life, where, inſtead of the Guardianſhip of a fond Father you muſt be guided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by ſo dangerous a Tutor as your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—Tho' you muſt be far remov'd from my Preſence, yet, I conjure you by every ſacred Tye, to think on your Father and the Advice he now gives you.</p>
                     <p>BE careful in obſerving every Duty of RELIGION. You will find it the ſureſt, and perhaps the only Way to keep <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Content</hi> in your Heart, and a Serenity and Chearfulneſs in your Countenance—<hi>By being a Man, be not aſham'd of being a Chriſtian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>CANDOUR, <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> are ſome of the ſtrongeſt Links that bind Men to each other. When theſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0558800101:151"/>
are abſent, Suſpicion, Fraud and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, will fill each Breaſt, and make us rather Companions for the wild Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Foreſt, than Aſſociates to Animals, who boaſt ſuperior Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>YOU are to live in the World.—You are to ſtudy the large Volume of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.—Whilſt thus employ'd, forget not that Mankind are ſtudying you.— Nature has given you an eaſy flexible Temper, therefore guard againſt the Charms of <hi>Flattery.</hi>—I know you will avoid the <hi>Profligate</hi> and <hi>Prophane:</hi> Shun likewiſe the <hi>Demure,</hi> the <hi>Preciſe,</hi> and the <hi>Very Godly.</hi> — Experience demonſtrates that <hi>Hypocriſy, Cunning</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally lurk under it, and that the <hi>Righteous overmuch,</hi> have other Schemes to <hi>work out,</hi> beſides their Salvation.</p>
                     <p>WITH <hi>Virtue, Truth</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which I truſt you will preſerve, there are Duties of Society that give Beauty and Harmony, and therefore muſt not be neglected.</p>
                     <p>A TENDERNESS for our Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a compaſſionate Turn for their Misfortunes, and Pity for their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, are what we owe ourſelves and them.—By not paying this Debt, we renounce our Claim to Humanity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0558800101:152"/>POLITE Behaviour and Complacency of Manners places every Action in the moſt advantageous Light, and adds ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Grace to every Word and every Motion.—Be ſincere in ſuch a Conduct, and ſuffer not your Lips to give the Lye to your Heart.—There is a Medium to be followed even to Perſons we have an ill Opinion of.</p>
                     <p>AS a general good Behaviour is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to, and required by all, you cannot fail of being remarkably ſo to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; but avoid making Friendſhips, till by Time you are convinced they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your's.—When you have found a Friend, deteſt the old and falſe Maxim of <hi>living with him as tho' he may become an Enemy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>GO not into the Way of Temptation; for, believe me, it will but too often fall in your's. Reſolution is ſtrong; but the ſtrongeſt is lodg'd in a <hi>frail Body,</hi> therefore depend not too much upon it, but, rather owe your Safety to a timely Flight.</p>
                     <p>IN your Dreſs, avoid as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the Gaudy and Fluttering, but in the Neat and Clean, endeavour to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. A Carefulneſs in properly ſetting off the Perſon, is commendable
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0558800101:153"/>
and uſeful. It argues a Deſire of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and gratifies the Eye of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder. A Propriety in Dreſs, and a certain Sobriety of Deportment, free from Affectation and Formality, will always add Weight to your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make it ſought after.</p>
                     <p>COMPANY and Chearfulneſs are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and of infinite Uſe; but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Jollity and Mirth betrays ſuch a Levity in the Mind, that your Preſence will never be deſir'd but merely to <hi>divert</hi> others, whoſe Regard ceaſes the Inſtant the Laughter is over.—Should your Wit offend, be aſſured of an Enemy for ever.</p>
                     <p>AS your Inclinations lead you to the Study of the Laws, you will ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Strength of the Foundation on which the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſtitution is built.— You will ſoon obſerve the Happineſs of that Kingdom, where the different Ranks of Men have their different Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, all coinciding and centering in the Preſervation of the Whole.—Let your Heart and your Hand be always ready to ſupport this Structure.—It has often been in Danger, and ſuffered mighty-Revolutions; but, as it is now fully repaired by a PROTESTANT AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHITECT,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0558800101:154"/>
be it your Care, as much as in you lies, to defend it from every Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Political,</hi> and from every Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick <hi>wicked</hi> Attempt.</p>
                     <p>AMBITION and Pride are Crimes of the moſt dangerous Tendency, yet, like Opiates, a ſmall Quantity is ſometimes neceſſary, as a large one gives the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient up to Frenzy and Madneſs, and, in the End, deſtroys him.—To have theſe in a juſt Degree, will raiſe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of excelling, and prevent a Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conduct.</p>
                     <p>A POET ſays, '<hi>There is a Pleaſure in being mad, which none but mad Men know.</hi>'—Be it ſo, but deſire not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it. Rather try what Pleaſure <hi>Common Senſe</hi> will afford.—<hi>She</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you in Oeconomy, and in that proper Management of your Fortune, that will bid Defiance to a Goal, and make your Sleep truly a Bleſſing.—<hi>She</hi> will teach you the right Uſe of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhew the Folly of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent with it.—<hi>She</hi> will hold a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to your Perſon, and point out the Abſurdity of being vain of it.—<hi>She</hi> will adviſe, direct, and ſhew you the World in its true and genuine Colours, and give you that Taſte, which <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

               <p>MR. STRONG had by Poſt received a full Account of <hi>Jack,</hi> and what he was deſtin'd for, ſo that when he appear'd with his Letter, he was received with a Sort of Civility that gave him ſome Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs. Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> was at Dinner, and having aſked him a few trifling Queſtions, deſir'd him to go to the Kitchen and get ſome Victuals. He bore this Indignity tolerably well, for his Appetite did not permit his quarrelling with Punctilios. In the Evening ſome more Queſtions were put to him, and was told he ſhould be taken next Morning where he was to live. It ſeems Mr. <hi>Strong</hi> had had Time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Matters.</p>
               <p>THIS was not the pleaſanteſt Night <hi>Jack</hi> paſs'd in his Life, but the Morning at laſt came that was to ſolve ſome Doubts. Mr.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0558800101:158"/>
                  <hi>Strong</hi> took his Hat and Cane, and deſir'd <hi>Jack</hi> to follow him. As they walk'd he told him they were going to Mr. <hi>Champignon</hi>'s the Weaver in <hi>Spittle Fields,</hi> with whom he had agreed to bind him Apprentice. <q>You may, ſaid Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> ſtay ſeven or eight Months on Trial; but I dare ſay you will like your Situation ſo well, that you will have Reaſon to thank your Friends.</q> —<hi>Jack,</hi> though not quite pleas'd, was glad to find Matters no worſe, and with more Chearfulneſs continued his March to the Weaver's.</p>
               <p>MR. STRONG entering, cry'd, 'Well, Monſieur, here is the Boy I ſpoke to you about; take him, and be ſure dont keep him idle.'—'Ha hah, ſaid <hi>Champignon,</hi> Parbleau he be a ver pritty Garçon, and I ſure you muſte workè ver well, for be gar ſi he no Travail he fall avè de ver good Soupe-maigre!—'That's right, ſaid Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> no Work, no Meat; but I hope he'll prove a good Boy, ſo, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, your Servant,—I'll call on you as I go by.'— 'Serviteur, Serviteur, Monſieur de <hi>Strang,</hi> cry'd <hi>Champignon,</hi> as you pleſe call en peſſant.'—<hi>Jack</hi> eye'd his new Maſter, and could ſcarcely forbear laughing at the Oddity of his Figure. He was about Sixty-five or Seventy Years of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0558800101:159"/>
Age, tall and very thin. His ſwarthy Skin did not ſeem to belong to what it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and his Cheek-Bones, in particular, diſcover'd a violent Inclination to eſcape through. He had on an old greaſy Stuff Gown, and a double mill'd Cap, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was formerly Scarlet. In ſhort, <hi>Jack</hi> thought he was bound Apprentice to a Skeleton, but a certain good natur'd Smile, and an agreeable Vivacity in the old Man, gave him ſome Proſpect of being better than he imagin'd.</p>
               <p>MONSIEUR <hi>Champignon,</hi> was one of the Million whom the Religious Wiſdom of LEWIS the <hi>Fourteenth</hi> compell'd to viſit <hi>England</hi> and other Proteſtant Countries, and who brought with them many uſeful Arts and Manufactures. He was a Man of great Application and Induſtry, which, with great <hi>Saving</hi> for a Courſe of Years, made him worth about Twenty Thouſand Pounds. He had a Gaiety in his Temper, and ſuch a Fund of natural good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that his Company was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to many eminent Merchants. His Wife was a good Sort of old Woman; but his only Child Mademoiſelle TONTON, was a moſt lively and pritty Girl of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four Years of Age. Her Complexion was not of the brighteſt, but her ſparkling
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0558800101:160"/>
Eyes, and her good Shape, made her a very deſirable Object. Her Father, from the Stingineſs of his Temper, had diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed her of two very good Matches, and the ſcandalous Chronicle of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood ſaid, ſhe had taken a proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
               <p>CHAMPIGNON was ſo whimſical, that he ſcarcely ever ſpoke <hi>French,</hi> and his <hi>Engliſh</hi> was ſuch a Medley, as to occaſion frequent Laughter. When he was aſk'd, Why he ſpoke not better <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,—<q>De par tout les Diables! — How you avè me ſpeak ſo better Englis? Sacre Chien! I avè live dans Londres no more as Forty Year, but avec de Time, me ſal avè de Converſation, Piff—Paff— ſo well as Monſieur me lor Merè.</q>
               </p>
               <p>JACK was employ'd in the uſual Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a junior Apprentice, and in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Ribbons, which he did tolerably well, but found he had not a natural Call to be ty'd to a Loom.</p>
               <p>IT would be impertinent to attempt to entertain the Reader with the many arch Tricks <hi>Jack</hi> play'd his new Maſter, or with the Mirth <hi>Monſieur Champignon</hi>'s En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh afforded. He was extremely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and often call'd <hi>Jack</hi> a <hi>Jean Fou-re,</hi> an <hi>Irland ſon-ma-biche,</hi> and many other
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0558800101:161"/>
whimſical Names that always excited Llaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>HE had now liv'd with Mr. <hi>Champig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> above Twelve Months, and was pretty well reconciled to the Family, whoſe Love he had got by Songs, and a thouſand <hi>Iriſh</hi> Stories. Miſs, in particular, was greatly diverted with his agreeable Chat, and he overheard her one Morning, tell her Maid; <q>That conſidering <hi>Conyers</hi> was <hi>Iriſh,</hi> he was the prettieſt young Fellow ſhe ever ſaw in her Life.</q>—Though his Manner of ſpeaking was greatly improved, yet there remained enough of his Country to be ſeverely banter'd by Miſs <hi>Tonton.</hi> She often inſiſted on his making Bulls and Blunders. She laugh'd at the Words, <hi>Unwell — Big Coat, — E're Yeſterday,</hi> and the like. — <hi>Jack,</hi> who was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pretty free, aſk'd her, if ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him when he ſpoke.—'Yes, ſaid ſhe, I comprehend your Meaning well enough; but you have ſuch unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Phraſes, one had need of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Expoſitor.'—'I'm glad, Madam, ſaid <hi>Jack,</hi> you are pleas'd to allow I ſpeak ſo as to be comprehended, but a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, the other Day, in our Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe cry'd out, <hi>"Did no body ſee any body take up never a Hat."</hi>—'I beg, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0558800101:162"/>
you will be ſo good to explain this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phraſe; for, upon my <hi>Sowl,</hi> I cannot.'—'Upon my Sowl! <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> and laugh'd violently at his Tone, without anſwering his Queſtion.'</p>
               <p>SUCH Sort of Converſation happen'd frequently, and was equally amuſing, but as he artfully ſuffer'd her to have the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in every Argument, and even aſk'd her Advice and Inſtruction, ſhe conceived a vaſt Opinion of his uncultivated <hi>Genius,</hi> and his natural good Parts.—Theſe Sort of Beginnings, generally lead to, and are but the Forerunners of Thoughts, not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be plainly ſet down.—Theſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Thoughts but too often occur'd,— <hi>Jack</hi> had them not,—Gueſs who then?</p>
               <p>MISS TONTON was one Morning at her Toilet very judiciouſly adjuſting her Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs before ſhe fix'd her Stays. Young <hi>Conyers,</hi> paſſing her Chamber, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the Reflection of her Glaſs, and calling him in a great Hurry, begg'd he'd look down her back for a Flea that teaz'd her immoderately. <hi>Jack,</hi> very innocently, examin'd the Part, and declar'd he ſaw nothing.—<q>Lord, ſaid <hi>Tonton,</hi> you're ſuch an unhandy Booby, you'll let the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eſcape, but look ſharp, <hi>Jack,</hi> I beg of you.</q>—<hi>Jack</hi> look'd, but his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0558800101:163"/>
being warm'd by the Touch, his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding became the clearer.—<q>Now, cry'd he, I ſee it.—There it hops, faith 'tis a Swinger.</q>—He then vigourouſly purſu'd the flying Animal, which, traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the whole Plain of her Back, took its Courſe to the Eminencies in Front, where it afforded a moſt delightful Chaſe. It ſkip'd from Hill to Hill, practis'd all the Craft of the Hare, but <hi>Jack</hi> was ſo keen a Sportſman, that he reſted not till he had fairly caught it.</p>
               <p>ASSOCIATES in Amuſements become In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, and frequently form Friendſhips. 'Twas ſo in the preſent Caſe. <hi>Tonton</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be extremely fond of <hi>Jack</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and found ſo many Opportunities to hunt, that one would imagine ſhe had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all the Fleas in the Pariſh, to afford him Diverſion. Her Maid <hi>Berſheba,</hi> who was old and ugly, prevented many an Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning's Sport, ſo ſhe was oblig'd to make Uſe of her as a Whipper-in, or as a Groom to hold the Horſes. By this notable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, <hi>Jack</hi> was frequently introduc'd when the Family were in Bed, and ſtay'd till they were near riſing, when he quietly retir'd through the old Maid's Room, whoſe <hi>Hey-day of the Blood</hi> was not over, but ſometimes <hi>mutiny'd in the Matron's
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0558800101:164"/>
Bones.</hi>—It ſeems poor <hi>Berſheba</hi> was likewiſe ſubject to Fleas, and the Hunting them became not a little troubleſome to <hi>Jack.</hi> It chagreen'd him much, and made <hi>Tonton</hi> very uneaſy.—At laſt he obtain'd a long Reſpite, but not in the Manner he choſe, for he was taken extremely ill, and a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fever enſu'd. No doubt he wanted not proper Care, and in Six Weeks he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to return to his Senſes, and a little to recover.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Uſe he made of his Reaſon, was to confeſs the Juſtice of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his repeated Crimes.—<hi>Bounty-Hall, Portarlington,</hi> his Friends, and all their good Advice, now came ruſhing into his Thoughts with ſuch Force, that he relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and had like never to have given me the Opportunity of writing his Hiſtory. His Youth and good Conſtitution at length prevail'd, and all Danger was over, except what might proceed from his extreme Weakneſs, or falling into a Conſumption. He recover'd ſo ſlowly, that the Doctor, like his Brethren, when they know not what elſe to do, advis'd a Change of Air for a Month or two. <hi>Champignon</hi> was one of the few <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of Subſtance, who had not a Country Houſe, and to take Lodgings and maintain <hi>Jack,</hi> would be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0558800101:165"/>
with an Expence he by no means could bring himſelf to think of.</p>
               <p>MR. VILLENEUF, a very eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in <hi>Black-Fryars,</hi> was an intimate Friend, and had frequently diverted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with <hi>Jack,</hi> whoſe pertinent Anſwers and good Underſtanding, made him a Sort of Favourite.—<hi>'Champignon,</hi> ſaid he one Day, Why don't you ſend poor <hi>Conyers</hi> to the Country?—The Lad will die here, and his Funeral will coſt you more than a Month's Lodging.'—'Ha, Ha, ſaid <hi>Champignon,</hi> I do no ſuch a-ting.—<hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleu</hi> I ſend <hi>Jean</hi> to de Diable—to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Strang.</hi>—Dat Gentilman he never come ſay, <hi>Champignon,</hi> how <hi>Jean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi> do?—Monſieur de <hi>Strang</hi> ſay noting, do noting—Poor <hi>Champignon</hi> muſte do tout.—<hi>Ventrebleu!</hi> Je crois dat de Monde tink me diablement richè!—I tellê you, <hi>Monſieur Villeneuf,</hi> poor <hi>Champignon</hi> ſall dye, alors you will ſee, you will regardé all my pauvre Richeſſe.'—'A d'autres, <hi>ſaid Villeneuf,</hi> I know you better. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if Mr. <hi>Strong</hi> be a <hi>Brute,</hi> I hope my Friend <hi>Champignon</hi> is not?—But I ſhall make this Matter eaſy, and honeſt <hi>Conyers</hi> ſhall not be loſt.—Send him To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow to my Houſe at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where he may be a Companion for my <hi>ſober
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0558800101:166"/>
melancholy Son,</hi> and perhaps do each other good.'—<hi>Champignon</hi> was not averſe to this Propoſal, and <hi>Jack,</hi> with his Trunk, were put into a Coach, and ſent off next Day.</p>
               <p>MR. VILLENEUF, the Son, was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Twenty-four Years of Age. He paſſionately lov'd <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Retirement,</hi> was extremely good natur'd and <hi>charitable;</hi> but had a <hi>Gloomineſs</hi> in his Temper, that made him averſe to much Company and Mirth. His Father, who had no other Child, was oblig'd to indulge him in his Humour, and ſupply him liberally with <hi>Money</hi> to gratify his <hi>generous Spirit.</hi> His large Fortune could very well afford this Expence.</p>
               <p>JACK was as happy as his diſturb'd Thoughts would permit, which were ever reflecting on his paſt Conduct, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding him with Actions of which he dreaded the Conſequence.—<hi>Repentance,</hi> he thought, might avert a further Puniſhment, and ſet himſelf ſeriouſly to think of it.— He knew, that <hi>truly</hi> to <hi>repent,</hi> he muſt lead a <hi>new Life,</hi> and avoid his <hi>former,</hi> and <hi>all other</hi> Crimes.—But how difficult! what Struggles had he to forget <hi>Nannett</hi> and <hi>Tonton!</hi> he could not avoid <hi>remembring</hi> the very Thing he wanted to be <hi>blotted</hi> from
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0558800101:167"/>
his <hi>Memory;</hi> then how could he ſay <hi>he would forget them?</hi>—No, but as he could not prevent the Intruſion of <hi>Thought,</hi> he was determin'd to refrain from <hi>actual Evil.</hi> As this was the utmoſt he could bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to, he reſted ſatisfy'd that this <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> would hold firm.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Week at <hi>Greenwich</hi> was not extreamly pleaſant, as young Mr. <hi>Villeneuf,</hi> ſeldom ſpoke to, or ſeem'd to regard him, but as the Apprentice of a Weaver, for whom his Father had ſome Value. <hi>Jack</hi> perceived the Reaſon of this Coolneſs, and by Degrees ſtole in a <hi>Latin Sentence;</hi> and ſome <hi>judicious</hi> Obſervations, but in ſuch Language and Accent (for he had quite loſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tone) that ſurpriz'd the young Gentleman, and made him deſirous of a more intimate Acquaintance. This he eaſily accompliſhed, and as <hi>Jack</hi>'s Health and Spirits encreas'd, he made great Progreſs in the Affections of Mr. <hi>Villeneuf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE old Gentleman had determin'd to ſend his Son to <hi>Paris</hi> for a Year or two, that by Travel, and a different Climate and Company, he might be brought inſenſibly to act <hi>like other Men.</hi> He found his Son was much pleas'd with <hi>Jack,</hi> and propos'd his going with him as a kind of <hi>Servant,</hi> of whom he might at Times make a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0558800101:168"/>
The young Gentleman expreſs'd his Satisfaction, and <hi>Conyers</hi> was vaſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted at ſeeing a little more of the World, and not be oblig'd to return to the <hi>perpetual Motion of the Shuttle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I MUST leave the Management of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Champignon</hi> to the old Gentleman, and bid adieu to <hi>Spittle-Fields, Tonton</hi> and <hi>Berſheba,</hi> for in three Months Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> and <hi>Conyers</hi> found themſelves in the Capital of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>JACK was now in his Ninteenth Year, of a good Stature, good Complexion, and, when dreſs'd, was a very <hi>genteel</hi> and <hi>handſome</hi> Fellow. His Eyes were black and ſprightly; he had a moſt agreeable Smile, and ſomething ſo eaſy in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he prepoſſeſſed every one in his Favour, almoſt at firſt Sight. When he ſpoke, it was with <hi>great Modeſty,</hi> but his Learning and good Senſe made him heard with Pleaſure. He had found out the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0558800101:170"/>
                  <hi>grand Secret</hi> of Converſation, which was to <hi>ſpeak ſeldom, but to the Purpoſe,</hi> and he had likewiſe learn'd to get the better in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>by ſometimes giving it up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HIS fix'd Allowance from Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> was but ſmall, but he equipp'd him with decent Cloaths, ruffled Shirts, and from Time to Time with <hi>Money</hi> ſufficient to dine at a good Ordinary, and be always clean and neat. Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> generally went out about Ten in the Morning, and return'd to his Lodgings about Five in the Evening, except he went to the Comedy, but never expected <hi>Conyers</hi> till about Eight or Nine o'Clock. <hi>Jack</hi> always attended when he was dreſſing, but was of little Uſe, as a <hi>French</hi> Footman performed all that Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>MR. VILLENEUF had a <hi>Fencing</hi> and a <hi>Dancing</hi> Maſter, rather becauſe it was the <hi>Faſhion,</hi> and that his Father inſiſted on it, than for any Uſe they might be of to him. The Gentlemen conſtantly attended, but <hi>Conyers</hi> principally received the Benefit of their Inſtructions. He likewiſe was very diligent at a Neighbouring Academy for Riding. This was of infinite Advantage, as it ſtrengthened his Limbs, and gave him a Carriage that ſtill added to the Graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Perſon. When his Curioſity
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0558800101:171"/>
was pretty much gratify'd, he applied cloſely to the beſt <hi>French</hi> Authors, making their <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> familiar to him. He examined and enquired, as far as he was able, into their <hi>Laws,</hi> their <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> and made ſuch Obſervations, that more learned Travellers need not have been aſham'd of. He had a Genius for Figures, and made himſelf a tolerable Maſter of ſome Branches in Mathematicks. In a Word, he took Care to be fully employ'd.</p>
               <p>HIS young Maſter, or rather his <hi>Friend,</hi> had Books enough, and in Converſation gave him many Hints which he improv'd. One Night at Supper, <hi>Villeneuf</hi> told him, he wonder'd at his ſtaying ſo much in the Houſe; and that he ought to go more into the <hi>World!</hi> 'You are always <hi>ſaid he,</hi> por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over Books, and adviſing me againſt what you practiſe yourſelf.'—'I confeſs, Sir, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> it is but too true. I am neceſſitated to act like the <hi>Gaſcoin;</hi> for, not having it in my Power to read the <hi>Great,</hi> I muſt content myſelf with the <hi>ſmall World,</hi> as I find it in Books.'— Pray, <hi>ſaid Mr. Villeneuf,</hi> how did the <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> manage?—'Why, Sir, <hi>reply'd Conyers,</hi> the <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> was juſt as <hi>poor</hi> a Fellow as I am, but he took it into his Head to be <hi>induſtrious,</hi> and amuſe himſelf
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0558800101:172"/>
with ſelling Water in <hi>Paris.</hi> An old Friend met him and his Pitchers, and was vaſtly ſurpriz'd that a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of his <hi>Noble Blood,</hi> could ſo demean himſelf, as to follow <hi>ſo low</hi> an Occupation. Lord! <hi>reply'd</hi> the <hi>Gaſcoin,</hi> you quite miſtake the Matter, for I am a Man of <hi>great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and ſuch a Favourite at Court, that the <hi>King</hi> has granted me <hi>the Waters of the Sein,</hi> but, as I have not found a <hi>Chap</hi> to buy the <hi>Whole</hi> at once, you ſee I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to <hi>retail it.</hi>—'So, <hi>ſaid Villeneuf,</hi> the Moral of the Story is, that your <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> prevents your following my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but henceforward, that ſhall be no Obſtacle. My Appointment is more than I poſſibly know how to ſpend, and muſt deſire your Aſſiſtance in the Management of Part of it. To begin, take theſe <hi>Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pieces,</hi> and command more when they are gone.'—Sir, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> I own I meant to beg a little Money, but could never imagine your <hi>Generoſity</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> extenſive and great as they are, could lead you into ſuch an Act, that my poor Services can <hi>never repay.'</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CONYERS, like <hi>Numps</hi> in the Comedy, was quite another Creature with <hi>Money</hi> in his Pocket, and ſo elate, that he could not avoid imparting his good Fortune to <hi>Madam

Commode,</hi> the Milliner where they lodg'd. She rejoic'd exceedingly, and extoll'd Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi>'s Generoſity to the Skies, but ſtill inſinuated, that <hi>the Bounty was vaſtly leſſen'd, when the Worth and Value of the Receiver was conſider'd.</hi>—Many were the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Encomiums beſtow'd on him by the <hi>good Woman</hi> and her fair Daughter, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle</hi> MADELAIN. This young <hi>Lady</hi> was bleſs'd with peculiar <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and ſuch a Fluency of Speech, that <hi>Conyers</hi> preſs'd her Acceptance of a Couple of <hi>Lewis d'Ors,</hi> which, by ſome <hi>accidental</hi> Words, he found ſhe ſtood in Need of. With great Difficulty ſhe conſented, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd him, <hi>it was owing to his irreſiſtable Politeneſs.</hi>—He imagin'd ſometimes, ſhe was <hi>troubled with Fleas,</hi> but he found thoſe of <hi>Paris</hi> more nimble than thoſe he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hunted; for, though he often attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he never could catch one of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delain</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>HE din'd moſt commonly at a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Hotel frequented by very good Company, where he had the <hi>Honour</hi> of hearing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pretty ſeverely handled, particularly by <hi>Monſieur</hi> MAQUEREAU, and the <hi>Chevalier</hi> FANFARON.—'I can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>ſaid Maquereau,</hi> how <hi>London</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains itſelf, for moſt of the Inhabitants

ſometimes <hi>dine</hi> with them, and, if you will take their Words, they are Men of <hi>Taſte</hi> and <hi>Politeneſs;</hi> and, to convince you of it, they will tell you the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>barbarous.</hi> They'll ſay the <hi>rudeſt</hi> Expreſſions with the moſt <hi>reſpectful</hi> Bow, and call it <hi>Good Manners.</hi> I own, Gentlemen, my Ignorance cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the vaſt <hi>Politeneſs</hi> of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but my little Experience has taught me not to judge of a whole Nation, by a few recent <hi>bad Samples.'</hi>—<hi>Fanfaron</hi> and <hi>Maquereau</hi> ſwell'd with Choler, but <hi>Penſé,</hi> in a Sort of peremptory Manner, deſir'd them to be eaſy, and added,—'I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd of all this.

                  <p>FANFARON was very early dubb'd a <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>famous</hi> and <hi>ancient Order of</hi> INDUSTRY. It is impoſſible to inform you of his many Exploits in <hi>France, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> where I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of meeting him and <hi>Maquereau</hi> at a Gaming-Table, and detected them of uſing loaded Dice: <hi>Fanfaron</hi> fell to my Share, and <hi>Maquereau</hi> to a Friend. The Diſcipline of the <hi>Cane</hi> and <hi>Kicking</hi> laſted a full half Hour, and was ſo entertaining,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0558800101:182"/>
that they have ever ſince done me the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of being extremely complaiſant.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Chevalier</hi> got acquainted in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> with Mrs. <hi>Smith,</hi> the Wife of an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Merchant. She was a moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Woman, and her Huſband was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond. His Buſineſs calling him to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> he prudently ſettled his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and made his <hi>dear Wife</hi> ſole Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, and divided his Fortune between her and a Child. Poor Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> went off, and his tender Conſort would have been inconſolable, had not the good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd <hi>Fanfaron</hi> comforted her in her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
                  <p>AT laſt the <hi>Chevalier</hi> perſuaded her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Scheme to make their Joys more compleat, and not ſo liable to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Curioſity of a <hi>Huſband.</hi> He very dexterouſly forg'd a Letter from the Correſpondent at <hi>Leghorn</hi> to Mrs. <hi>Smith,</hi> full of kind Expreſſions and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the great Difficulty he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by being oblig'd to mention the <hi>Loſs</hi> of ſo <hi>worthy</hi> and good a Man as Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who took a <hi>Fever,</hi> and, in Spite of all Aſſiſtance, and the Skill of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, died in his Arms the Ninth Day, confirming a <hi>Teſtament</hi> made in <hi>England.</hi>

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0558800101:183"/>MRS. SMITH was now a <hi>Widow,</hi> and acted that Part to ſuch Perfection, that her Relations thought ſhe could not long ſurvive.'—'Good Heaven! <hi>cry'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> I ſhudder at the Conſequences.'— Well, Sir, <hi>ſaid Penſé,</hi> notwithſtanding her mighty Grief, her <hi>Weeds</hi> and <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring</hi> to the Will were not forgotten. In fine, ſhe call'd in the Debts, ſold off the Stock in Trade, the Houſe, and every Thing belonging to it, and finding her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Six Thouſand Pounds</hi> in Caſh, very fairly bid <hi>Adieu</hi> to her <hi>Huſband,</hi> her <hi>Child,</hi> her <hi>Father,</hi> and all her Relations, and flew with her beloved <hi>Fanfaron</hi> to this famous City.</p>
                  <p>POOR Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> return'd ſoon after to <hi>England.</hi> If his Pleaſure was great at the Thoughts of meeting his <hi>deareſt Wife,</hi> what were the Torments he endur'd, when he found he had not only loſt <hi>her,</hi> but was reduc'd to <hi>Beggary?</hi> Words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs his melancholy Situation, and the Manner of it afflicted him more than had he been depriv'd of all, by any other Accident. His Friends did all in their Power to aſſwage his Woes; and, as he had an extream good Character, and was really an honeſt Man, the <hi>Merchants of London</hi> acting like themſelves, ſupported
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0558800101:184"/>
his Credit abroad, advanc'd him Money, and ſet him ſo fairly in the World, that I left him greatly recover'd in his Spirits and Fortune.</p>

               <p>'DEAR Sir, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> you give me great Joy, but I am curious to know, if poſſible, what became of Mrs. <hi>Smith.</hi>'— Her Fate, <hi>reply'd Penſé,</hi> was dreadful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. <hi>Fanfaron,</hi> for ſome Time, liv'd a gay and ſplendid Life. <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> were not amongſt his Virues or Vices; ſo that in about Twelve Months, <hi>Madam</hi> was ſent to <hi>Graze on the Common,</hi> till at laſt, having run through every Scene of Miſery, attended by a <hi>guilty</hi> Conſcience, ſhe finiſh'd her Days in the Hoſpital of <hi>La Charitè.'</hi>

               <p>TEARS ſtood in <hi>Conyers</hi>'s Eyes; but when he a little recover'd, 'poor Wretch, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> as the Hand of Providence is ſo viſible, I ſhall not pretend to arraign its Juſtice or Mercy.—I preſume, <hi>continued he,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Fanfaron</hi> enjoys the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her Fortune with <hi>vaſt</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Satisfaction, and doubt not, but he will ſome Day or other, have the Honour of entertaining a Crowd at the <hi>Greve;</hi>'—'and very likely, <hi>added Penſé,</hi> attended by his Friend <hi>Maquereau.</hi>—This other fine Gentleman, <hi>continued he,</hi> was a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0558800101:185"/>
Footman in <hi>Paris,</hi> and went to <hi>London</hi> with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord. Had he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honeſty, he might have made a Fortune, for he don't want Senſe. He paſs'd through many Services, and was remarkably dextrous in the <hi>nice</hi> Conduct of an Affair, which in <hi>Italy</hi> is managed by <hi>a Secretario de Amore,</hi> and what in <hi>England</hi> is term'd <hi>Pimping.</hi> The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he got by this Branch of Buſineſs, was all laid out at the <hi>Gaming-Table.</hi> However, I found him in <hi>Paris</hi> a few Years ago, with an <hi>Equipage;</hi> but by ſome Circumſtances that then happen'd, I have Reaſon to believe his laſt Maſter was not the richer for him.—But let us drop theſe Fellows, for they are not worth our Thoughts, tho' we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd ſometimes to <hi>dine</hi> with, and be <hi>civil</hi> to them.'</p>

               <p>IN the Evening, <hi>Jack</hi> gave Mr. <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf</hi> ſome Account of his Viſit, and did not forget the Deſcription of a <hi>Bear-leader.</hi> —<q>Certain it is, <hi>ſaid Villeneuf,</hi> nothing improves the Mind of a young Man like <hi>prudent Travel.</hi> We are ſenſible of this in <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>few</hi> know how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct it.—We generally take a <hi>Lad</hi> from the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> where, tho' he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd <hi>ſome Learning,</hi> yet he is as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the <hi>World</hi> as his <hi>Bed-maker,</hi> and at once <hi>Caſe</hi> him up in fine Cloaths, and let him <hi>Run</hi> a Winter or two in <hi>London.</hi> He is then <hi>taken up</hi> and <hi>ſaddled</hi> with a Governor, who <hi>Races</hi> him round <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and in two or three Years he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns

to his <hi>dear Parents</hi> loaded with the <hi>Bawbles</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> of each Country.'— And is this, Sir, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> the mighty Uſes of Travelling?'—''Tis but too frequently ſo, <hi>reply'd Villeneuf,</hi> but when a Youth of Education, improved by good Company, travels with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Senſe</hi> for his Companion, his Friends may expect the <hi>Harveſt</hi> of a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Accompliſhment.

               <p>'SIR, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> tho' I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be a Traveller, yet I cannot help
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0558800101:188"/>
obſerving, that the <hi>Courteſy</hi> of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not of <hi>the right Breed.</hi> Their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, or, as they call it, <hi>their Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſeems to me rather an Habit, and <hi>Jingle of Words,</hi> than to carry a Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignificant of what they expreſs.'— Sometimes, <hi>ſaid Villeneuf,</hi> it is ſo; yet, when I find myſelf deceived, their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing it, prevents my finding Fault, and even pleaſes. 'Tis <hi>this Sort</hi> of Manner that makes a Stranger <hi>paſs his Time,</hi> more agreeably in <hi>France,</hi> than in moſt other Countries, and what I wiſh our People had a little more of.'—I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Sir, <hi>anſwered Conyers,</hi> if our <hi>Engliſh</hi> want that <hi>Manner,</hi> they make it fully up by their <hi>Sincerity.</hi>—So we ſay, <hi>reply'd Villeneuf,</hi> but ſuppoſe it Fact, What have I to do with the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of a People with whom I mean to paſs but a ſhort Time; to contract no particular <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips;</hi> and to keep myſelf in that neutral <hi>civil Stile</hi> which every Man has a Title to? Believe me, <hi>Conyers,</hi> Men of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will be naturally drawn to <hi>that Place</hi> where they can purchaſe moſt <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and receive moſt <hi>Honour.</hi> You may, if you pleaſe, call it <hi>Flattery;</hi> but ſince we chooſe to <hi>ſwallow,</hi> they are in the Right to adminiſter <hi>the Doſe.</hi>'—'I wonder, <hi>ſaid
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0558800101:189"/>
Conyers,</hi> that ſo much of it don't turn the Stomach.'—Juſt the contrary, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd Villeneuf,</hi> for the Stomach is ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to it, that it becomes a <hi>real Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment,</hi> and a Nutriment, that many <hi>Courts</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> are ſo fond of, that they will purchaſe it, tho' their <hi>Liberties</hi> may be the Price.—I have often heard, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> have always aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Univerſal Monarchy,</hi> but I ſhould imagine, that the Fate of the <hi>Romans</hi> who fell by their own Weight, would deter them from ſuch a Project; but <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> have no Bounds.'— If, <hi>ſaid Villeneuf,</hi> they have ſuch Notions, they may manage in another Manner. By the Converſation I have frequently had with ſome Gentlemen of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have laid down a Plan of <hi>French Politicks</hi> by Way of <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and not as <hi>Truth,</hi> which is very difficult to come at. If my Conjectures are right, their Syſtem is ſhort, and far from <hi>impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>—But it is now late, ſo take it, and examine it at your Leiſure.'</p>
               <p>WHEN both were retir'd, <hi>Conyers</hi> read, and copied, as he always did, the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Mr. <hi>Villeneuf.</hi> He now began, from the Study of <hi>Books,</hi> to examine the <hi>Truth</hi> from the Study of <hi>Man,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

               <p>CONYERS conſtantly viſited Monſieur <hi>Penſé</hi> and was much improv'd by his Company. Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> was ſo extreamly pleas'd, that he ſupplied him very liberally with Money; but whatever good Senſe <hi>Jack</hi> poſſeſſed, he by no Means underſtood the Uſes of <hi>that Commodity.</hi> His <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady</hi> and the fair <hi>Madelain</hi> were determined to enjoy an <hi>equal Share</hi> of it, at the ſmall Expence of a little <hi>Flattery,</hi> and the nice tickling the String of <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Self-Opinion,</hi> ſo common in <hi>Youth,</hi> and what
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0558800101:191"/>
                  <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> are not always Proof againſt.</p>
               <p>THESE Ladies had engaged the Eſteem of <hi>Conyers,</hi> by a thouſand winning Ways; but now, his <hi>Perſon</hi> and his <hi>vaſt</hi> Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments were the Theme of every Hour. When they ſpoke of him to Strangers, it was with <hi>Rapture,</hi> but they took Care that he was <hi>within hearing.</hi> This Sort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct not only produced frequent <hi>Plays, Operas</hi> and Parties of Pleaſure; but often extracted <hi>half a dozen</hi> Pieces for ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Emergency, which were repaid by <hi>Madelain</hi> in <hi>Careſſes,</hi> and by every Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom except <hi>the laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY often wiſhed that <hi>Conyers</hi> had a Fortune agreeable to his Merit, and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, that perhaps they might be of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him. —'It is not, <hi>ſaid Madame Commode,</hi> a New or Uncommon Thing for <hi>Ladies</hi> of <hi>Fortune</hi> to make themſelves Happy with a young Gentleman of your <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding.</hi>'—'And I know, <hi>ſaid Madelain,</hi> a moſt beautiful Lady with <hi>half a Million of Livres;</hi> that, I believe, ſees Monſieur <hi>Conyer</hi> oftener then he imagines.'—'In a Word, <hi>cry'd Madame,</hi> ſince my Girl has blabbed out ſo much, I muſt tell you a little more. The Daughter of a <hi>rich</hi> Banker of <hi>Paris,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0558800101:192"/>
has ſeen you, and is actually in <hi>Love.</hi> Her Companion ſups with me this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and you muſt be of the Party.'— Lord, Madame, <hi>cry'd Madelain,</hi> what a charming Couple they will be! how <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully</hi> will they live!—What a <hi>ſuperbe</hi> Equipage, and <hi>magnificent</hi> Hotel! Good God! What cannot <hi>Youth, Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> do together.'—'Hold, hold, <hi>ſaid her Mother,</hi> not ſo faſt if you pleaſe. Fair and ſoftly:—This muſt be a Work of ſome Time, and managed with <hi>great Addreſs,</hi> or we ſhall ſtumble on many Difficulties.'—<hi>Conyers</hi> bluſh'd, and gave many Thanks for the good Opinion ſhe was pleaſed to entertain of him—that he would ſtudy to deſerve her Favour, and would be entirely guided by her.—'Leave it to me, <hi>reply'd Madame,</hi> and I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to make ſomething of it.—I need not deſire you to be chearful and free with the <hi>Lady</hi> to Night, but don't think of making her any <hi>Preſents</hi> till you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a little more intimate, which I hope will be about the third Viſit.—<hi>Preſents</hi> muſt be made, but let them be <hi>genteel</hi> and <hi>frequent.</hi>—They <hi>pave</hi> the Way, and <hi>oyl</hi> the Hinges,—<hi>You underſtand me.</hi>'— Extremely well, <hi>reply'd Conyers,</hi> and as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0558800101:193"/>
I know they are abſolutely neceſſary they ſhall not be wanting.'</p>
               <p>CONYERS provided ſome excellent <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> and <hi>Champaign,</hi> and in the Evening was preſented, with great Form and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums, to the <hi>amiable</hi> Companion of the Fair <hi>unknown.</hi> At Supper he was extremely Gay and polite, and, at her Requeſt, ſung ſeveral new Songs in an elegant Taſte.— <hi>Mademoiſelle</hi> FARDE was highly delighted with his agreeable Company, and gave many Proofs of it.—<hi>Madame Commode</hi> and <hi>Madelain</hi> were very laviſh in their Praiſes, and the Night concluded with mutual Marks of Eſteem and Reſpect.</p>
               <p>A SECOND and a Third Evening paſt pretty much like the Firſt, except that <hi>Mademoiſelle Fardé</hi> and <hi>Conyers</hi> were very intimate and free; <hi>Madame Commode,</hi> by Accident ſhewing ſome fine new faſhioned <hi>Caps</hi> and <hi>Ruffles, Conyers</hi> embraced the luckly Opportunity of preſenting <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle Fardé</hi> with what ſhe ſeemed to like moſt. The Gift was a <hi>Trifle</hi> of about <hi>Twelve Lewis d'Or's;</hi> and, with great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, was accepted. That Night the <hi>good Lady</hi> of the Houſe brought on the proper Subject, and with ſome Heſitation <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle Fardé</hi> acknowledged that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Conyer</hi> was not indifferent to the <hi>Lady</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0558800101:194"/>
ſhe had the <hi>Honour</hi> to live with.—<hi>Conyers</hi> bow'd and aſſured her he was in <hi>Love</hi> with the Deſcription of that <hi>beautiful Angel,</hi> and with many Apologies, begged ſhe would convey a ſmall <hi>Billet</hi> to her fair Hands. <hi>Mademoiſelle Fardé</hi> objected to ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure, and would have abſolutely refuſed it, had not <hi>Madame Commode</hi> and <hi>Madelain</hi> moſt artfully pleaded his Cauſe.—He had a <hi>Letter</hi> prepared, which he moſt reſpectively gave her.—She was equally <hi>ready,</hi> and, with a wink, ſlipped a <hi>Note</hi> into his Hand.</p>
               <p>WHEN all were retired he read his <hi>Billet</hi> which contained theſe Words, <q>I have my Reaſons. Let me ſee you To-morrow Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Six o'Clock in the Tuilleries. Keep this a profound Secret. Adieu.</q>—<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> was punctual, and <hi>Fardé</hi> was exact.— She told him, 'twas impoſſible to meet ſo often at <hi>Madame Commode</hi>'s without being obſerved, and to take him to the <hi>Lady</hi>'s Houſe was impoſſible; that to be of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to both, ſhe had taken a <hi>private</hi> Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, where they could ſettle Matters, and where the <hi>Lady</hi> would certainly meet him, were it in her Power. She then added, <q>We may be obſerved even here, let us retire.</q> — <hi>Conyers</hi> attended, and was conducted to a little Lane, and a very <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> Chamber of which ſhe had the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0558800101:195"/>
Key.—Here ſhe informed him of many Particulars with Regard to the <hi>young Lady,</hi> and gave him Hopes of bringing Matters to bear, and promiſed her utmoſt Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. — So much Goodneſs naturally claimed a <hi>grateful</hi> Return, and at laſt ſhe was prevailed on to accept <hi>Ten Pieces.</hi> His <hi>Generoſity</hi> charmed her, nor could ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear anſwering his tender <hi>Embraces,</hi> which by Degrees became more <hi>Fervent,</hi> ſo that —<hi>you will permit a Continuance of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE had now compleatly fixed <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle Fardé</hi> on his Side, yet they met at his Lodgings as uſual, but more frequently in this.—The young <hi>Lady</hi> anſwered his Billets in a proper and polite Manner, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to <hi>Hope.</hi> He reply'd as polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Correſpondence went on in the moſt agreeable Manner, though he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought that <hi>the Poſtage was rather too expenſive;</hi> however, as he was ſure of the Lady's Affections, he judged it well beſtowed, and waited for the Iſſue with great Patience for above Four Months.</p>
               <p>ONE Morning as he was going out, he found a Letter to <hi>Madame Commode,</hi> which had been dropt by Accident, and he read,</p>

               <p>CONYERS found Means to perſuade <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneuf</hi> to change Lodgings, and on various Pretences to borrow a few <hi>Louis</hi> from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Commode,</hi> and even from <hi>Mademoiſelle Fardé.</hi>—At laſt he contrived a Letter as from <hi>London</hi> to a Merchant in <hi>Paris,</hi>

wherein, among many Particulars, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his Surpriſe, <hi>that</hi> Mr. <hi>Conyers would chooſe to live in the Manner he did with</hi> Mr. <hi>Villeneuf, when a large Eſtate waited his Orders, by the Death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> A Gentleman delivered to Mrs. <hi>Commode</hi> this Letter open with Directions where he lived, but that he would have the <hi>Honour</hi> of waiting on Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> in a few Days.</p>
               <p>'TIS not eaſy to conceive the Impreſſion this Letter made on the Mother and Daughter.

               <p>FOR ſome Time paſt, Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> had frequently made <hi>Conyers</hi> of his Party, and was not diſgrac'd by his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. This Day a ſelect Company din'd at an eminent Citizen's.—Chearfulneſs and good Humour added the true Reliſh to the Entertainment; but when the Servants were withdrawn, the Converſation fell on particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Subjects.—<q>As no Man, <hi>ſaid Monſieur St. Martin,</hi> can judge ſo impartially of his <hi>own Country</hi> as a <hi>Stranger</hi> of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I ſhould be glad Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> would give us his Opinion of <hi>France,</hi> with Freedom, and his accuſtom'd Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</q>—Many Apologies were made, and Compliments returned, till at laſt Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> conſented, provided that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0558800101:206"/>
was fairly ſtated.—'I cannot ſuppoſe, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> you mean to have my Opinion on what regards State Affairs.'—'No, no, <hi>reply'd the other,</hi> we only beg your Thoughts of the <hi>People,</hi> their <hi>Politeneſs,</hi> their <hi>Manners,</hi> their <hi>Dreſs</hi> and their <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or otherwiſe.'—''Tis a difficult Taſk you have aſſigned me, <hi>ſaid Villeneuf,</hi> and will require your Patience: But as <hi>great</hi> and <hi>little—long</hi> and <hi>ſhort—ſtrong</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> are made ſuch, only by <hi>Compariſon,</hi> I hope you will permit an alternate Account of <hi>England,</hi> under the ſeveral Articles.' —The Company approv'd of his Method, and he began.</p>

                  <p>FEW People on Earth are bleſſed with ſuch a Fund of Spirits and <hi>natural Gaiety</hi> of Temper as the <hi>French;</hi> and yet few Nations are more crampt in the <hi>natural</hi> Exerciſe of it. They <hi>laugh,</hi> they <hi>ſing,</hi> they <hi>dance,</hi> and ſeem content. The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick are conſtantly ſupplyed with Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>Policy</hi> has ſo contrived, as to make <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>War</hi> be thought a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Recreation. All are diſregarded but thoſe who ſerve the <hi>King</hi> in his Troops; his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Name is never mentioned, but with the profoundeſt Reſpect. We never ſee his Portrait hung out as a <hi>Sign,</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe it would be treating
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0558800101:207"/>
the <hi>Monarch</hi> with too much Freedom, but the Sign of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> and all the <hi>Saints</hi> are diſperſed through every Street. A King is always the Head of the moſt childiſh <hi>Games,</hi> and at <hi>Cards,</hi> the Beſt, is honoured with that Title.— Such Principles are propagated with great Art, and the Religion of the Country admitting <hi>Auricular Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> an <hi>Abſolute Monarch</hi> can, with Eaſe, direct the Current of Opinion.—Men of Learning and Judgment muſt go with the Stream, for it falls from too high a Fountain to be reſiſted, whatever their private Sentiments may be. Beſides, Two or Three Hundred Thouſand <hi>Orators</hi> well armed, will always carry Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and Conviction. In <hi>England,</hi> where the Conſtitution admits the full Enjoyment of <hi>Property,</hi> and where <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> is proportionably divided amongſt all the Inhabitants, one would imagine they ſhould be more chearful than the <hi>French,</hi> but the Fact is otherwiſe; for this very <hi>Property,</hi> and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of employing it, has the contrary Effect. They have the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> but a <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> and the perpetual Dread of <hi>loſing it,</hi> throws <hi>Thorns</hi> on their <hi>Pillows,</hi> and, like the Miſer, they <hi>ſtarve</hi> in the midſt of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0558800101:208"/>
                     <hi>Plenty.</hi> They employ <hi>Watchmen for their Security,</hi> yet are in conſtant Fear of being <hi>plundered</hi> by them.—This is the Riſe of all the Clamour againſt an <hi>Handful</hi> of Troops.—The Religion of <hi>England</hi> teaches <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and thoſe in Authority under him, but ſome imagine, that the <hi>Liberty of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> gives the People a Right to <hi>abuſe all;</hi> not conſidering, that by <hi>leſſening</hi> and <hi>ridiculing</hi> the juſt Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their <hi>Governors,</hi> they <hi>leſſen</hi> their own <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Conſequence</hi> in the World.</p>
                  <p>FRANCE has propagated the Notion of <hi>Military Honour</hi> to ſuch a Degree, that they are become a Nation of JANISA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES, and perhaps muſt be treated as ſuch,—that is, they muſt, <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Wrong,</hi> be frequently employed. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> and <hi>Traffick</hi> flouriſh in Peace.— <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Plenty, Learning</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> are the Conſequences, as well as <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Luxury.</hi> Men naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fond of theſe Sweets, and will not quietly forego them. They will find out their own <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> They will expect a Freedom of <hi>Action,</hi> as well as <hi>Thought,</hi> and <hi>abſolute Monarchy</hi> will fall before them.—RICHELIEU knew this.—

He broke and divided the Power of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> not like <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh of <hi>England,</hi> amongſt the People, but added <hi>all</hi> to the Dignity and Power of the <hi>Crown.</hi>—MAZARIN did the ſame, and LOUVOIS, FOUQUET and COLBERT com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Project, and the long Reign and Ambition of LEWIS confirmed it. The <hi>King</hi> of GREAT-BRITAIN is the Fountain of <hi>Honour;</hi> but the Monarch of this Kingdom is not only the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of <hi>real,</hi> but the <hi>Creator</hi> of <hi>imaginary</hi> Honours. A trivial <hi>Croſs</hi> dangling at a Button-hole, gives a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman ſuch a Spirit of <hi>Honour,</hi> as to intreat a General to permit him to mount a Breach. In <hi>England,</hi> it muſt be a <hi>valuable Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> that can perſuade moſt Men even to do their Duty.</p>
                  <p>THE Faſhions of the two Nations are on different Footings. Here, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Manner the <hi>King</hi> or thoſe about him are pleaſed to wear their <hi>Swords,</hi> or dreſs their <hi>Hair,</hi> it inſtantly becomes the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all <hi>Paris.</hi> Every Man from the <hi>Duke,</hi> to the <hi>Porter,</hi> has his <hi>Hat</hi> cocked and his <hi>Coat</hi> cut nearly in the ſame Manner. <hi>London</hi> affords more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.—There every Man dreſſes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his <hi>Fancy.</hi> Some have Coats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0558800101:210"/>
the <hi>Knees,</hi> and Breeches down to the Middle of the Leg. Others mount their Breeches to the <hi>Thighs,</hi> and raiſe their Skirts to their <hi>Waiſts.</hi> Some Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers dreſs like <hi>Privy Counſellors,</hi> and ſome of <hi>high Rank</hi> may be miſtaken <hi>for Coach-men.</hi>—I am ignorant who had the Honour of inventing <hi>Weepers,</hi> when in Mourning, but I think I may venture to affirm our Manner of wearing them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the End of Ornament, and keeps the Shirt from being <hi>blacken'd</hi> by the <hi>Coat.</hi> To wear them on the Top of the Sleeve, can anſwer no End.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Engliſh Ladies</hi> rely on their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Charms, nor want the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Paint</hi> to heighten their Complexions. Whether the <hi>French Ladies</hi> really ſtand in Need of Art, I know not, but their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſeems to imply it.—Whatever good Senſe the <hi>French</hi> are Maſters of, this is certainly not the moſt glaring Inſtance.</p>
                  <p>IN <hi>France, Politeneſs</hi> is not always <hi>good Manners,</hi> neither is the <hi>Bluntneſs</hi> of an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> always a Mark of <hi>Sincerity.</hi> The <hi>Lye</hi> is more frequently given in <hi>France,</hi> than is generally imagin'd, but the <hi>Pardon</hi> that is <hi>begg'd,</hi> and the <hi>Excuſe</hi> that is <hi>demanded, (Je demand Excuſe; Pardonne moi)</hi> ſoftens the <hi>Negative,</hi> which,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0558800101:211"/>
with the Addition of ſundry ſignificant <hi>Geſtures,</hi> Cuſtom has made That genteel, which frequently is the Reverſe.—In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> theſe Cuſtoms are accounted ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and they <hi>deny</hi> or <hi>contradict</hi> in plain Terms, even without the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>rude</hi> Monoſyllable.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE been often told, <hi>"I muſt own."</hi> (Il faut avouer) 'I confeſs I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Phraſe.—If <hi>I muſt believe,</hi> I am depriv'd of the Liberty of thinking for myſelf, and my Arguments muſt ceaſe, when I am pinn'd down to the Reaſons of my Antagoniſt. In <hi>England,</hi> the Freedom of judging is held more ſacred.</p>
                  <p>THE Theatres of the two Nations were different. The Tragedies and Plays of the <hi>Engliſh Shakeſpear</hi> gave Riſe to thoſe of <hi>France.</hi> His Imagination was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd by the Rules of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he thought he had as good a Right to <hi>Alter,</hi> as the other had to <hi>Make.</hi> If the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by following new <hi>Models,</hi> are more regular in <hi>Unity, Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> I am ſorry to ſay, their <hi>Fire</hi> is not ſo <hi>bright,</hi> nor will their <hi>Heat</hi> laſt ſo long. —<hi>Monſieur de Voltaire</hi> and <hi>l'Abbé le Blanc</hi> take great Pains to ſhew the Abſurdity of ſome of our Authors, in tranſporting
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0558800101:212"/>
the Audience to different Kingdoms, and continuing the Scenes of one Play for many Years, but they do not tell us, that in Tragedy or Comedy, where we are to ſuppoſe an <hi>eaſy, natural</hi> Converſation, it is <hi>unnatural</hi> to make the Parties ſpeak in <hi>Rhyme.</hi> They inſiſt, that the Action ſhould be confin'd to twenty-four Hours; if ſo, I apprehend it is unnatural to have it repreſented in three. If twenty-four Hours Buſineſs can be ſhewn in ſo ſhort a Time, we may as well have twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four Years.—The <hi>Abbé</hi> complains of our murdering on the Stage, and ſays, that a Man, not underſtanding our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, muſt take us for a barbarous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, delighting in Blood. Should a Man, not underſtanding <hi>French,</hi> ſee the Stage in Tears, and in the utmoſt Agony of Grief, muſt he not wonder what has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned it? The Truth is, neither of the Stages are made for thoſe who do not underſtand the Language, but I really think every Stranger, or <hi>Frenchman</hi> of Senſe, muſt be ſhock'd at the <hi>unnatural abſurd</hi> Entertainment of a <hi>Speaking Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequin</hi> with a <hi>patch'd Coat, and a black Face.</hi>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0558800101:213"/>
here in a much higher Degree. The <hi>French</hi> have a Way of varniſhing their <hi>Vices,</hi> and making them more dangerous and catching than our aukward Manner can arrive at.—When an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſwears by his <hi>Maker,</hi> it is ſhocking, but when the <hi>French,</hi> with Eyes and Hands lifted up, cry out, <hi>Sacred God!</hi> (Sacré Dieu!) it is little regarded, as it is the common Expreſſion of every Ten Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. The <hi>French</hi> have another <hi>Phraſe,</hi> which is but too commonly us'd, even before <hi>Ladies,</hi> and what ſome Ladies are as familiar with. This <hi>Phraſe</hi> ſerves to ſhew <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Anger,</hi> according to the Tone or Manner of ſpeaking.—How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are the Words, <hi>Fou-re, Fou-u, Bou-re, Bou-ſſe,</hi> pronounc'd in the <hi>politeſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,</hi> and paſs'd over as if no <hi>Idea</hi> was annex'd to them?—I am ignorant of any Rules that eſtabliſh ſuch Indecencies, except the ſtrong <hi>Law</hi> of a <hi>bad Cuſtom.</hi> I am much pleas'd that <hi>Voltaire,</hi> and <hi>le Blanc,</hi> could not mark <hi>theſe</hi> amongſt our other <hi>Follies;</hi> but they totally forget them when they mention their <hi>own.</hi> The <hi>Abbé</hi> very juſtly cenſures the <hi>Looſeneſs</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldry</hi> of ſome of our Comedies, but he omits to inform us, <hi>that no Nation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels</hi>

                  <p>WITH regard to the Happineſs of the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> no Mortal can judge. It muſt be left to their own Deciſion; that is, <hi>each</hi> will give the Preference to <hi>themſelves,</hi> for each have that <hi>natural</hi> Prejudice and Partiality to their own

Country, that perſuades them into an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their <hi>peculiar Felicity.</hi>—Did not Mankind deceive themſelves, by imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>ideal</hi> Happineſs, they would be miſerable in <hi>Reality.</hi>—Deform'd Perſons have generally a large Share of <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Self-Opinion.</hi> They are infinitely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, when their Mirror diſcovers <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Charms</hi> which the World do not find out. Such a Conduct is juſtify'd by the wiſe Scheme of <hi>Providence,</hi> as it gives Eaſe and Comfort to their Lives, which otherwiſe would be almoſt inſupportable. —Perhaps the ſame Argument may be apply'd to <hi>Kingdoms.</hi>

                  <p>Thus, Gentlemen, I have given ſhort <hi>Hints</hi> of my private Opinion, taking Things in a <hi>general</hi> Light, but I know there are many Exceptions.—The <hi>Wiſe,</hi> the <hi>Good,</hi> the <hi>Honeſt</hi> of both Nations, have equal Sentiments, and ſpeak one <hi>common Language.</hi>—Both Nations have their <hi>peculiar</hi> Virtues as well as Vices.— In a Word, if the People of <hi>one</hi> were leſs a Dupe to <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>arbitrary Power,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> leſs a Prey to <hi>extravagant Liberty,</hi> I apprehend, <hi>both</hi> would have more Content.—But to be <hi>perfectly happy,</hi> is not given to <hi>human Nature.</hi>

               <p>THE Converſation inſenſibly became more general, and their different Opinions were given with Freedom and good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. <hi>Conyers</hi> had his Share, and made himſelf very agreeable by ſprightly and chearful Turns.—<q>Come, come, <hi>ſaid Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur St. Martin,</hi> talk as you will, I think it is given up, that we live with <hi>Gaiety, Mirth</hi> and <hi>Chearfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> is Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <p>NEXT Morning Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> found himſelf much out of Order, yet he could not avoid mentioning what, with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he had omitted in the Converſation of Yeſterday.—<q>God forbid, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that perſecuting Spirit ſhould ever prevail in <hi>England,</hi> yet I ſhould imagine, <hi>Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> ought at leaſt to keep us upon our Guard againſt the Encroachments of POPERY; for, though <hi>we</hi> are not their <hi>Enemies,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet they are certainly our's, becauſe we are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi>—We ſuffer them in <hi>England</hi> to <hi>purchaſe Eſtates;</hi> and the Influence Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty carries with it, is ſometimes too viſible.—They are likewiſe permitted to <hi>ſell</hi> their Eſtates, but the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0558800101:221"/>
                     <hi>France</hi> may <hi>purchaſe,</hi> but cannot ſell.— We allow our Subjects to attend the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Chapels</hi> of Foreign <hi>Miniſters,</hi> but what <hi>Frenchman</hi> dare viſit our Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's Chapel at <hi>Paris?</hi>—Without forcing the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men, I think we <hi>might,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to take ſome Example from our Neighbours.—Sending <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Youths of both Sexes, to be educated in the <hi>Colleges of Jeſuits,</hi> or in the <hi>Convents</hi> of <hi>Nuns,</hi> is ſuch a <hi>monſtrous,</hi> ſuch an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd</hi> Practice, that, as no Name can be given, ſo no Puniſhment can be equal to the Crime.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THIS, Sir, <hi>reply'd Conyers,</hi> has often ſurpriſed me, but there is another Matter, equally aſtoniſhing.—I know what was formerly underſtood by a <hi>Nonjuror.</hi> I know that a ſcrupulous Conſcience might refuſe the Oaths to <hi>King</hi> WILLIAM, when he had before taken them to <hi>King</hi> JAMES, but I cannot conceive what a <hi>Nonjuror</hi> is in theſe Days.'—'And you will, ſaid <hi>Villeneuf,</hi> be more amazed, when I tell you, he is one of thoſe <hi>rank Weeds</hi> that the beſt <hi>Land</hi> is moſt ſubject to. A <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juror</hi> is a Perſon that avails himſelf of that <hi>Liberty,</hi> and Conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> which his <hi>Principles,</hi> and the <hi>Study</hi> of his whole Life, <hi>labours to deſtroy.</hi>—He denies
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0558800101:222"/>
the <hi>Validity</hi> of the Foundation of our <hi>Laws.</hi>—He calls himſelf a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and yet acts on <hi>Popiſh</hi> Tenets.—How it is poſſible, ſuch a Being can be ſuffer'd in our State, is paſt my Comprehenſion. —If he refuſes the <hi>Oath</hi> of Allegiance, which I wiſh was more frequently ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, what <hi>Security</hi> has the Government for his Conduct? And ought he not to be <hi>expell'd</hi> a Society, to which he <hi>avows</hi> himſelf an Enemy?—If he muſt be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, why is he not ſerv'd like the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and oblig'd to wear a <hi>Badge</hi> of Diſtinction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ON this Subject Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> gave many Hints, but <hi>Conyers</hi> prevented his enlarging too much; and, as he ſaw his Countenance frequently change, he perſuaded him to lie down.—All the Morning he complained of a violent Head-Ach, and Pain in the Back. —All Precautions were taken, and the beſt Phyſicians employ'd, but all prov'd inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, for this <hi>good,</hi> this <hi>valuable</hi> young Gentleman <hi>died</hi> the fourteenth Day.</p>
               <p>POOR <hi>Conyers</hi> was in the utmoſt Affliction, for he loſt his <hi>Brother,</hi> his <hi>Friend,</hi> his <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and his whole Support.—For ſome Time he was not able to attend his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; but the good Nature of Mr. <hi>Penſé</hi> ſhar'd his Sorrows, and directed his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0558800101:223"/>
—By the Will of Mr. <hi>Villeneuf,</hi> he found himſelf poſſeſs'd of Sixty Pounds, with all the Books and wearing Apparel he had in <hi>France. Penſé</hi> advis'd the ſelling the Books and all the Cloaths, except the Shirts; which done, he had about <hi>One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty</hi> Pounds to begin a new Life. —<hi>Penſé</hi> knew perfectly his Situation, and many Projects were thought on to put this Sum to a proper Uſe; but, as neither of them could contrive how he might <hi>live</hi> on it, they paſs'd them over without fixing, but <hi>Penſé</hi> promis'd to think for him.</p>
               <p>WHILST their Imaginations were buſily employ'd in forming Plans for his future Conduct, an Accident happen'd which I am almoſt aſham'd to mention. I once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have ſuppreſs'd this Accident, but my ſtrict Adherence to <hi>Truth,</hi> obliges me, though with Reluctance, to make it a Part of this Hiſtory. Beſides, as all the Memoirs and Papers that ſerv'd in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling this <hi>great Work,</hi> are now depoſited in the <hi>Cotton Library,</hi> for the Peruſal of the Curious, and to vouch the Authenticity and Impartiality of this Performance, with what Face could I <hi>omit</hi> or <hi>gloſs over</hi> a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Circumſtance, and make my Veracity doubtful to the Publick. If <hi>ſome</hi> have taken
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0558800101:224"/>
a contrary Method, I am determin'd to <hi>keep mine Integrity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CONYERS did not always dine at the ſame <hi>Hotel,</hi> for different Companies afforded him different Remarks. At one of theſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, he had made a Sort of Acquaintance with a genteel young Man, of about his own Age, without inquiring into his Character. The Converſation happen'd to turn on the Folly and Abſurdity of <hi>Gaming,</hi> and this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman laid open the Subject and the Schemes of <hi>Sharpers,</hi> in ſo clear and convincing a Manner, that charm'd <hi>Conyers.</hi>—After Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they took a Walk together, and renewed the Subject.—'Few Men, <hi>ſaid the Stranger,</hi> underſtand <hi>Play</hi> better than I. Formerly I was a <hi>Bubble</hi> to it, but when I became a Maſter, and might have won back the Money I had loſt, though I don't much want it, my Friends and Relations got round me, and oblig'd me to renounce <hi>Gaming</hi> for myſelf. I now aſſiſt ſome Friends, and but laſt Night I won <hi>two hundred Pieces</hi> for the Gentleman in Blue, with Gold <hi>Brandenburghs,</hi> that din'd with us. This I frequently do, and am of Uſe to ſome <hi>honeſt Fellows.</hi>'—'I ſhould imagine, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> that a Man who conſtantly <hi>plays,</hi> muſt ſometimes be liable to <hi>Quarrels, Diſputes,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0558800101:225"/>
Difficulties.'—'I grant you, <hi>reply'd the Gentleman,</hi> ſuch Affairs happen in poor low Company, but the Aſſemblies I frequent, are compoſed but of People of <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Fortune.</hi> Moſt of them <hi>incog.</hi> ſo no one takes Notice, or ſeems to know another, but all are on the ſame Footing.'</p>
               <p>OUR Hero liſten'd with great Attention, and, by his many Queſtions, ſeem'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to venture a ſmall Matter, which perchance might <hi>double</hi> his Fund. The two hundred Pieces won laſt Night, ran ſtrangely in his Head, and his Imagination put him already in Poſſeſſion of ſuch a Sum. Like a <hi>Fiſh,</hi> he went round and round, and often nibled at the Bait, till at length his eager Deſires ſurmounted his Fears, and he ſwallow'd the <hi>Hook.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Conyers</hi> propos'd viſiting the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> the other made ſome few Difficulties, but was at laſt prevail'd on to lend him his Skill. In Purſuance to the Plan of Operation, <hi>Conyers</hi> gave him <hi>Forty Louis,</hi> and put <hi>Twenty</hi> more into his own Pocket. It was too ſoon to begin the Project; and, to divert the Time and raiſe their Spirits, the Gentleman propoſed a Bottle of <hi>Champaign.</hi> They finiſh'd two, and <hi>Conyers</hi> found himſelf extremely elate,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0558800101:226"/>
and prognoſticated vaſt good Fortune. He was like <hi>Alnaſchar</hi> the famous <hi>Glaſs Man,</hi> for he had rais'd his Thoughts, and built the Edifice of <hi>Grandeur,</hi> but others had the Honour of <hi>kicking</hi> it all down.</p>
               <p>THEY arriv'd at the Temple, where the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were aſſembled, and very earneſt at their <hi>Devotions.—Conyers</hi> was fix'd at a Table with good Company, where he won and loſt, but much wonder'd his Friend did not appear and aſſiſt him. He grew a little uneaſy, but when he enquir'd, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was not to be found, neither did any one know his Name. <hi>Conyers</hi> was unwilling to ſuſpect him, and purſu'd his Fortune ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.—As no Man knows his own Courage till he is try'd, ſo <hi>Conyers</hi> knew not his <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Play,</hi> until he was at a Gaming Table.—His twenty Pieces being near ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd, he ventur'd to aſk, <hi>If any Gentleman would give him Credit till next Morning, in caſe he loſt.</hi> With great Politeneſs they all agreed, <hi>there was no Difficulty in confiding in a Gentleman of his Appearance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Play continued, and the <hi>Dice</hi> flew about with the uſual Vehemence.—The <hi>fickle Goddeſs</hi> held the changing <hi>Balance,</hi> and joy'd to ſee ſuch true, ſuch fervent Zeal in all her Votaries.—The <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> being finiſh'd, <hi>Conyers</hi> began to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0558800101:227"/>
examine the <hi>Mythology.</hi> He now diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> was extremely erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, for he had not only loſt <hi>all</hi> his <hi>ready Money,</hi> but was indebted above <hi>Fifty Louis d'Ors.</hi>—The ſmall Remains of the Night was not employ'd in the moſt agreeable Reflections, neither was the Morning uſher'd in with happier Thoughts, for the Crime of laſt Night <hi>ſtar'd</hi> him full in the Face, in the Shape of <hi>three Gentlemen</hi> with Demands of Money. Whilſt employ'd in diſcharging theſe <hi>Debts</hi> of Honour, Mr. <hi>Penſé</hi> enter'd, which put him in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Confuſion. <hi>Penſé</hi> began to imagine that his Friend had taken up the Buſineſs of <hi>lending Money</hi> on <hi>Pledges,</hi> but a little of their Converſation ſoon convinc'd him of his Error.</p>
               <p>WHEN the three Gentlemen had retir'd, our Friends ſtood ſilent, and gaz'd on each other for ſome Time.—<q>Well Sir, <hi>ſaid Penſé,</hi> I find the <hi>Prudent,</hi> the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> the <hi>Sagacious</hi> Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> is beholden to <hi>Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> for making his Fortune, and giving him Experience.</q>—<hi>Conyers</hi> bluſh'd, and, with ſome Heſitation, told his melancholy Tale; but concluded, with heartily <hi>curſing</hi> the Falſhood of the <hi>French.</hi>—<q>Very fine, <hi>cry'd Penſé,</hi> very fine, indeed.

damn a whole Nation; but the Truth is, you ought to quarrel with your own <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Imprudence,</hi> and I hope you will ſo effectually do it, as for ever to baniſh them your Company.—<hi>Gaming, continued Penſé,</hi> is the moſt ruinous of all Vices. It is—</q>
               </p>
               <p>AS an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> I muſt be extremely angry with one HENRY FIELDING, who has wrote the Memoirs of a <hi>profligate Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> whom he calls TOM JONES.—This Man has done me great Injury, and I am apt to believe has ſeen the <hi>Materials</hi> of this Hiſtory; for in one of his Volumes, he has not only copy'd the very long Diſcourſe Mr. <hi>Penſé</hi> made on <hi>Gaming,</hi> but has rak'd together all that the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> have ſaid, or <hi>could</hi> ſay on that Subject; ſo that he has very <hi>unfairly</hi> depriv'd me of the Benefit of a Dozen or Twenty Pages, which I muſt ſtrike out, or be thought a Plagiary.— This is not the only Place where the ſaid FIELDING has curtail'd my Reputation and crampt my Genius.—Without ſaying more on this <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>ungentleman-like</hi> Uſage, I muſt inſiſt, that the good natur'd Public will believe, I ſhould have had <hi>more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi> and have been as fertile <hi>in Wit</hi> and <hi>Humour</hi> as the ſaid <hi>Fielding,</hi> had he not
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0558800101:229"/>
                  <hi>cruelly</hi> and <hi>enviouſly</hi> foreſtall'd my Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>CONYERS was all Attention to Mr. <hi>Penſe</hi>'s Harangue, and moſt faithfully promis'd to ſhun Temptation and avaricious Thoughts. —<q>The Miſchief is done, <hi>ſaid Penſe,</hi> ſo I ſhall upbraid no more. I had a Scheme for your Service, but doubt your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to it. I ſhall not flatter you, for, <hi>Why ſhould the Poor be flatter'd?</hi> But what I have to ſay is my ſincere Opinion. —You are, <hi>continued he,</hi> a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome genteel young Fellow, you have Learning and Underſtanding. You have cultivated your Talents by the Additions of polite Accompliſhments; and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of your Voice, and your good Nature, make you belov'd by all. My <hi>dear Conyers,</hi> it is no Crime to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of our Perfections, the <hi>Folly</hi> lies in being vain of, or over-rating them.— With your Endowments, and a prudent Management, you may make your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and be happy.—A Man muſt <hi>ſtoop,</hi> before we can juſtly ſay, he <hi>riſes.</hi> In a Word, I wiſh you would act the Part of a <hi>Servant.</hi>—You will be maintain'd and cloath'd. By your Addreſs, I know you will acquire Eſteem; and, as there are Secrets in all Families, no doubt but
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0558800101:230"/>
ſome may paſs through your Hands. Out of theſe, and ſundry Accidents that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably happen, you may ſcheme ſome civil Employ, and eſtabliſh yourſelf in the World, as many <hi>worthy Men</hi> have done, not bleſs'd with half your Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.'—<hi>Jack</hi> liſten'd, but made no Reply. —'There is, <hi>ſaid Penſé,</hi> another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Favour of my Project, and a ſtrong one, for I do not ſee what elſe you can do.</q>—This laſt Reaſon got the Better of Pride, and <hi>Conyers</hi> conſented.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>NOW, <hi>ſaid his Friend,</hi> to convince you I have had you in my Thoughts, I can promiſe you a Service with an <hi>Engliſh Lord,</hi> now returning to <hi>London;</hi> he is rich, extremely good humour'd, but not the <hi>brighteſt</hi> Genius in the World.—He keeps an <hi>Engliſh Wench.</hi>—I need not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> you to endeavour to have her Favour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AT Dinner they met again, when <hi>Penſé</hi> inform'd him that my <hi>Lord Weakhead</hi> with Pleaſure conſented, as he wanted one to take Care of his <hi>Wardrobe,</hi> and write his <hi>Letters.</hi> —<q>I would not, <hi>continued he,</hi> have you always fix'd to a particular <hi>Service</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;</hi> for, except your Judgment ſhews you a Probability of ſucceeding in your <hi>chief</hi> Deſign, ſhift about, and try another Soil; but be ſure to take Care of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0558800101:231"/>
                     <hi>little Money</hi> you have left, leſt you ſhould be too long unemploy'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>NEXT Morning they waited on <hi>Lord Weakhead,</hi> who would not agree, until his <hi>Dulcinea</hi> had approved. In ſome Time the Lady made her Appearance, and was ſo good to ſay, <q>
                     <hi>ſhe</hi> believ'd the Fellow would do well enough.</q> His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> told <hi>Conyers</hi> the Duty he expected from him, and the <hi>Lady</hi> added ſome for herſelf.—He was to have thirty Pounds a Year, and ſome <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites,</hi> to enable him to be decent.</p>
               <p>IN three Days they ſet out for <hi>England.</hi>— The Friends parted with great Regret, and took a moſt tender Adieu. <hi>Penſé</hi> gave a Hint, that in all Likelihood a <hi>War</hi> would ſoon break out, and begg'd of <hi>Conyers</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to write to him.</p>

                  <hi>JACK</hi> was ſoon ſettled in a Family-way in <hi>London,</hi> but found a mighty Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between his laſt and preſent Maſter. <hi>My Lord</hi> had a fine Houſe, and a Number of Servants were maintain'd at a vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; yet the Whole was conducted in ſo ſlovenly a Manner, that nothing was in Order, and ſomething was always wanting to compleat the intended Elegance.—<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Haughty</hi> ruled all, and govern'd with
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0558800101:233"/>
a Power as uncontroul'd as it was extenſive. She frequently ſchool'd his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> in ſuch Terms, that made <hi>Conyers</hi> conceive an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Averſion for her. Some Times ſhe had violent Fits of Jealouſy, and on thoſe Occaſions my <hi>Lord</hi> was never permitted to approach, neither could any Rhetorick, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of a <hi>Purſe,</hi> perſuade her into any tolerable Temper.—Her male Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances were <hi>Singers, Fidlers,</hi> young <hi>Fops,</hi> and a Couple of worn-out <hi>Sharpers.</hi> Her female Friends were <hi>Milliners, Mantua-Makers</hi> of ſmall Repute, and ſome <hi>Nymphs</hi> of her own Order. For theſe a plentiful Table was kept, and the Incenſe of Praiſe was conſtantly perfuming on the Altars of the <hi>Goddeſs Haughty.</hi> Tho' the Houſe was perpetually crowded, yet properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Lord Weakhead</hi> ſaw no Company.</p>
               <p>MADAM HAUGHTY had a ſtrong <hi>Levée</hi> almoſt every Morning; and, becauſe ſhe had been in <hi>France,</hi> and heard ſomething of the Conduct of their Ladies of Quality, ſhe frequently received their Viſits in Bed. <hi>Conyers</hi> always made the Tea, and, with a Footman, attended the Duty of the Table. One Morning, when the Company were pretty numerous, <hi>Jack</hi> was buſy employ'd in this Office, but happening to go into the Lady's Dreſſing-Room, he found a Bottle
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0558800101:234"/>
with a Label, on which was wrote <hi>Mouth Water;</hi> and, as his Gums were ſwell'd with a Cold, he innocently uſed this Water as a Gargle. Whilſt he was filling out the Tea, his Lips ſhrunk up, and his Mouth almoſt clos'd. The Company could not forbear ſmiling at the Oddity of his Face, which was quite diſtorted. Madam, at laſt perceived the Queerneſs of his Phiz, and, with a Laugh, aſk'd him, What was the Matter? When he attempted to anſwer, his whole Face was in Convulſions; but, as he could not articulate a Word, he ran to the Dreſſing-Room, and produced the Bottle. <hi>Haughty</hi> burſt into a violent Laugh, and whiſper'd a Lady near her, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the Secret to a Third, and in a Moment all preſent were in the utmoſt Mirth; and a thouſand Witticiſms were thrown out, till <hi>Conyers</hi> was oblig'd to quit his Station, and ſeek Refuge in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where, with Patience and warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he brought his Features to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd Regularity; but it was not till ſome Years after, he found out what had occaſion'd his Diſorder, and the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Banter he ſuffer'd.</p>
               <p>MRS. HAUGHTY carry'd her Ridicule ſo far, that it raiſed his Reſentment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd him to watch her Motions more
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0558800101:235"/>
narrowly. In the mean Time he could not avoid making ſome ſerious Reflections on the Conduct and Situation of <hi>Lord Weakhead.</hi> He thought that the Life of a <hi>Man of Quality</hi> was to be employ'd in ſhewing good Examples to the World; and, with ſome Sighs, compar'd the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of his preſent Maſter to that of <hi>Lord True good.</hi>—He was ſurpriz'd how a <hi>Peer</hi> could run from the Dignity his <hi>Anceſtors</hi> had purchas'd, and act below the Character of the meaneſt Mechanic. He was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd that a <hi>Nobleman,</hi> who might almoſt command the beſt Society, and a Lady of the firſt Family, where good Senſe and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would grace his Table, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe rational Comforts, and amuſe himſelf with the Dregs of Mankind, and a <hi>Woman</hi> of a moſt abandon'd Life. He was at laſt convinced, that his <hi>poor Lord</hi> had all the Plagues the worſt Wife could give, without any one of thoſe Pleaſures ſhe might ſometimes beſtow.</p>
               <p>THIS <hi>Lady</hi> hath diſcover'd, that Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Tenderneſs were not the Charms moſt admir'd by my <hi>Lord</hi> in a Miſtreſs, but that his Conſtitution was to be govern'd only by abſolute Power. The more ſhe ſeem'd to hate and deſpiſe him, the fonder he grew. Her inſolent Security was ſuch,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0558800101:236"/>
that ſhe ſcarcely made a Secret of her Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, ſo that <hi>Conyers</hi> caught her one Morning <hi>beating Time</hi> to the Muſick of a dirty Fidler. She colour'd a little, at being ſo fairly diſcover'd; but, with a matchleſs Aſſurance, propos'd his taking a Part in the <hi>Concert. Conyers,</hi> with a Smile of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, anſwer'd, He had too good a <hi>Taſte,</hi> to be charm'd with a <hi>common vulgar Ballad.</hi> Her Rage is not to be expreſs'd, ſhe ſwore like an old Dragoon; and in this Temper he quitted her in Contempt.</p>
               <p>AMONGST the many who paid Court to my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Madam Haughty,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froid,</hi> a young Surgeon of <hi>French</hi> Extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was pretty conſtant. He had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Regard for <hi>Conyers,</hi> and was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſon who found out his Value and Merit. <hi>Sangfroid</hi> was a Man of Senſe, and whoſe Converſation was ſeriouſly diverting, and his ſpeaking <hi>French</hi> extremely well, made <hi>Conyers</hi> fond of being often with him. To this Gentleman he told his Story, and begg'd his Advice. <q>I ſee, <hi>ſaid Sangfroid,</hi> you are not perfectly acquainted with this Part of the World. I have ſometimes interfered between a <hi>Gentleman</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and have made up mighty Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels occaſion'd by <hi>Lap-Dogs, Parrots,</hi> and the like; but I never meddle between
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0558800101:237"/>
a Gentleman and his <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi> It is of too ſacred and delicate a Nature, neither can my Probe ſearch to the Bottom of the Wound; and, as I perceive that a Mortification muſt of Neceſſity enſue, why ſhould I give my Patient unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pain? However, <hi>continued he,</hi> don't repine at being diſmiſſed this Service, but live with me until I can provide you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q> 
                  <hi>Conyers</hi> return'd him many Thanks, and that Evening accepted his kind Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for my <hi>Lord</hi> very gravely paid him three Months Wages, and gave him a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
               <p>MR. SANGFROID received him with great Kindneſs, and apologiz'd for not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in his Power to be more conſtantly with him, but he never fail'd at Dinner, and ſeldom in the Evenings. In theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations <hi>Conyers</hi> took Care to ingratiate himſelf with his new Friend, and diſplay'd his Learning and Accompliſhments in ſo agreeable a Manner, as not a little ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Surgeon, who confeſs'd he merited an happier Fate: <q>But, <hi>continued he,</hi> it ſhall not be my Fault, if ſomething don't turn out to your Advantage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CONYERS paſs'd his Time in a very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Manner, for <hi>Sangfroid</hi> entertain'd him with Hiſtories of ſundry Families, but
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0558800101:238"/>
with ſuch Humour, as created Abundance of Mirth and moſt uſeful Obſervations; which laſt, <hi>Jack</hi> conſtantly added to his Collection.</p>

               <p>ONE Evening our Friends had agreed to go to a favourite Play, where Mr. <hi>Sangfroid</hi> met ſeveral of his Acquaintance. 'I ſee, <hi>ſaid he to Conyers,</hi> a Knot of choice Spirits in the third Row; ſhould they aſk me to a Tavern, I muſt deſire your Company; for, though it will be <hi>Time thrown away, it will not be loſt.</hi>' 'I cannot, <hi>reply'd Conyers,</hi> rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your Diſtinction, but command me.' 'That young Gentleman, <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0558800101:239"/>
the Surgeon,</hi> in a white Fuſtian Frock, and checquer'd Flannel Waiſtcoat, with the Hat of a Stage Coachman, is <hi>Sir Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Royſter</hi> of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> who inherits good four thouſand Pounds a Year. He's not yet of Age, but borrows Money e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, by inſuring his Life. That <hi>eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly Youth</hi> juſt by him, with a red Face, is <hi>Squire Moriſe,</hi> formerly of <hi>High Hall</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire.</hi> That fine Seat, and fifteen hundred a Year round it, has been long purchaſed by Mr. <hi>Punctual,</hi> a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in the <hi>Strand,</hi> on which the Squire has two hundred a Year Life-Rent. That genteel young Man on the other Side, is one Mr. <hi>Fitz-Simons</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where, I imagine, he has a good Fortune, for he is extremely generous. He has Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the <hi>Middle Temple,</hi> and for theſe three Years has ſtudy'd very cloſely. A little beyond him you ſee a portly <hi>fierce</hi> Gentleman in Scarlet, with a Point <hi>d' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpagne</hi> Hat ſo cock'd, that it frights the Orange Wenches. He is called <hi>Major Noiſy,</hi> and, I have been told, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> in the Army, but was oblig'd to ſell out and retire on Enſign's Half-pay; but the <hi>Knight</hi> is his Friend.' —'I think, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> you apply the Word <hi>fierce</hi> to the Major; now, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0558800101:240"/>
it is derived from, the <hi>French</hi> Word <hi>fier,</hi> which means <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>ſaucy,</hi> I beg you will give him ſome other Epithet, for I obſerve he is extremely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with the Orange Ladies, who ſeem to attack him with equal Freedom.'— Your Obſervation, <hi>ſaid Sangfroid,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is right, but really the Major is far from being <hi>proud;</hi> but how <hi>fier</hi> may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>ſaucy,</hi> I hope to convince you: However, they are all my Friends and Cuſtomers; and the Plague of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is, I muſt not only keep them Company, but agree to every Thing they ſay, when in Company.'</p>
               <p>THE Play was ſcarcely finiſhed, when the Major gave a loud Hem, and having fix'd <hi>Sangfroid</hi>'s Eyes, call'd out, —<hi>The King's Arms,</hi> and received a Nod of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.— <hi>Sir Nicholas</hi> and his Company got firſt to the Tavern, having pick'd up two ſpecial City Sparks. When Mr. <hi>Sangfroid</hi> and <hi>Conyers</hi> arriv'd, they found the <hi>Major</hi> and the reſt very loud at the Larder. With great Difficulty Supper was order'd, and the Maſter, Mr. <hi>Ryan,</hi> conducted them into the <hi>Roſe.</hi>— As an Hiſtorian, I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to attend, but, <hi>courteous Reader,</hi> if <hi>thou'rt not charm'd with Diſcord of harſh Sounds,</hi>—If a <hi>Tavern Scene</hi> delighteth not

               <p>THE Inſtant the Major enter'd the <hi>Roſe,</hi> he cry'd out, <q>Z—ns! what a Room has the Raſcal put us into?—Here— You Son of a W—re, ſhew us into the <hi>Rummer,</hi> this ſmokes like Hell!</q>—<hi>Ryan</hi> was all Obedience, and, as he conducted them back, the <hi>Knight</hi> could not avoid ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Ay, ay, let the <hi>old Soldier</hi> alone; D— me he'll keep 'em all in Order.</q>— The uſual Salutations began, and Mr. <hi>Sang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froid</hi> introduced <hi>Conyers</hi> to each, by their Titles.—<q>Sir, <hi>ſaid the Major,</hi> give me your Hand. D—n all theſe Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; you ſeem, Sir, to be a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a Man of Honour, and D— me but we're all oblig'd to <hi>Young Bolus</hi> for your Company.</q>—<hi>Conyers</hi> juſt began to return the Compliment, but the Major interrupted him, ſaying,—'Sir, You are a very pretty ſenſible Gentleman, and <hi>(ringing the Bell as loud as he could)</hi> we'll take a hearty Bottle together, and know me for your Friend.—Here—You Oſtler —D— me, where is the Wine.'— Pleaſe your Honour, <hi>ſaid the Waiter,</hi> the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0558800101:242"/>
Wine your Honour always chuſes is on the Table.'—'D'ye prate, Puppy? <hi>ſaid he,</hi> to Kennel, down this Inſtant,— Avaunt!'—The Waiter retir'd with a Smile, and then he began, <q>Come, Boys, —Come Lads, ſit down and be D—d, and take your Wine in Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>
               </p>

My Father, <hi>Juſtice Noiſy,</hi> 'tis well known, had two thouſand a Year in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and gave his Children as much Learning as they would take. Your <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> was not my Turn, and the Fool my Maſter flogg'd me damnably before he found it out, which happen'd by an odd Accident, for when I was about Fifteen, the Son of a B—h was at his old Tricks with his <hi>Birch,</hi> but d—me if I didn't take him ſuch a Knock over the Noddle with the Poker, that down dropt Old <hi>Ars in preſente,</hi> and the beſt of the Joke was, that the Scoundrel was a <hi>Parſon.</hi> The old Juſtice laugh'd heartily, and prais'd my Spirit, ſo I thought <hi>I had him on.</hi> I wanted d—ly to get to <hi>London,</hi> but my Chap was as cloſe fiſted as the Devil, and not a Stiver would he part with to buy me a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was all my Pride. The old Fool at laſt married a young B—h for Love, and uſed me like a Dog. D—me thought I but I'll be reveng'd, and you'll ſplit your Sides with laughing when I tell you how I contriv'd it.—D—n my

In a Week I got acquainted with ſome <hi>fine Ladies,</hi> and very fond of me they were, for D—me but I was as fine a Lad as ever trod the Ground, and five Foot Seven in my Stocking Feet. The dear B—hes ſoon made me known to ſome Gentlemen of Quality, ſo that in about a Month I knew <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> and <hi>London</hi> as well as if I had been bred and born in't; but
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0558800101:247"/>
D—me if I know to this Day how it was, but in ſix Weeks I'd but a ſingle Guinea left.—Now ſome Lads would have <hi>ſnivel'd</hi> and <hi>cry'd,</hi> and begged <hi>Pardon,</hi> and ſo forth; not me by G—d. I kept up my Heart like a Man, and as I could not purchaſe a <hi>Red Rag,</hi> I bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to earn one with my Sword, ſo I went to the Parade, and <hi>took on</hi> in the Firſt Regiment of Guards.</q>—The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany greatly applauded his Courage and Reſolution, and he proceeded—<q>A Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle, a Trifle, Gentlemen.

To be ſure 'tis terrible enough at firſt, D—me if it isn't, but when a Man is us'd to it for four or five Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns as I was, 'tis a mere <hi>Flea-bite.</hi>— Well, as I was ſaying, having cut a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the <hi>covered Way,</hi> and with fixed Bayonets maſtered the <hi>Half Moon</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Parapets,</hi> and a Breach being made in the <hi>Glacis</hi> by our Engineers, I boldly mounted, and the whole Army following, the poor Devils of <hi>French</hi> ſurrender'd the Town.—The <hi>Gazette</hi> did me Juſtice, and the Noble General made me an <hi>Enſign.</hi> At <hi>Blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim</hi> the next Campaign, I did my Duty, got a few Wounds and a <hi>Company,</hi> and the ſame Year a <hi>Majority.</hi>—You know the reſt. My old Dad <hi>kick'd up,</hi> and like an unnatural Son of a Whore as he was, left me a Shilling. A d—d <hi>Peace</hi> being made, and a Boy put over my Head, I quitted the Service, and have been on Half-Pay ever ſince, but now—

               <p>THE Bottle and Wit went briskly round, till <hi>Sangfroid,</hi> clapping <hi>Sir Nicholas</hi> on the Shoulder, 'There, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> there's a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of Mettle: I think I ſee him routing a whole <hi>French</hi> Army; I wiſh he'd write his Memoirs, they'd ſell d—d well.

               <p>EVERY Body agreed, and poor <hi>Noiſy</hi> ſtood a whole Volly of Wit.—'Truce, Boys, Truce, <hi>cry'd the Major,</hi> Why what the Devil, <hi>all upon Roger!—Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimons,</hi> do <hi>dear Rogue,</hi> tell us ſome of your fooliſh Exploits, and keep <hi>Sir Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> in Countenance.'—'I'd do as much for you, <hi>ſaid Fitzſimons,</hi> with all my Heart, but it ſeems you have no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, for the <hi>Devil himſelf</hi> can't put you out of Countenance.'—This encreaſed the Laugh, till <hi>Sangfroid</hi> cry'd out, <q>Well, Gentlemen, I muſt own the Major has ſaid <hi>a good Thing</hi> once in his Life, and I ſecond the Motion; to Order Gentlemen, to Order, Mr. <hi>Fitzſimons</hi> is up,—<hi>hear him, hear him.</hi>

               <p>AT laſt the Noiſe of <hi>War</hi> ſeemed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and gentle <hi>Peace</hi> began to ſpread her

Pinions. The mangled Limbs of <hi>ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Bottles</hi> and <hi>Glaſſes</hi> were decently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, and the purple Stream, that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Half the Plain, was now ſwallowed up by the neighbouring Sands. All Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being adjuſted, Tranquillity was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and three Bottles called for, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Love and Friendſhip.—Bumpers went briſkly round, and their Zeal was ſo fervent to eſtabliſh a <hi>right Underſtanding,</hi> that ſome of the Company began to loſe their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Z—NS, <hi>cry'd the Knight,</hi> what Fools were we to quarrel amongſt ourſelves, when the <hi>common Enemy</hi> is at Hand?— D—me, my Bucks, let's ſally forth and <hi>beat the Watch!</hi>'—'Glorious Thought! <hi>ſaid the Major,</hi> and let's beat up the <hi>Bawdy-Houſes.</hi>'—'I'm with you, <hi>cryed Moriſe,</hi> by the L—d 'tis the <hi>moſt fineſt</hi> Fun in the Univerſe.—To pay—a Bill this, Inſtant, and let's to Buſineſs.</q>—All ſeemed to join, and whilſt the Bill was preparing, <hi>Sir Nicholas</hi> ſettled the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>THE Reckoning was <hi>Three Pounds Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Shillings,</hi> and each Man put his Hand to his Pocket.—The <hi>Major</hi> laughed, and ſwearing he had changed his Breeches that Morning, and forgot to ſhift his Money,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0558800101:259"/>
added, <q>'Tis no great Matter, for my Servant is an honeſt Fellow; however, Sir <hi>Nick, tip</hi> me a Guinea till I ſee you next.</q>—The Knight readily comply'd, and Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> ſaying, <q>It is juſt our <hi>Half Guineas a-piece,</hi>
                  </q> threw one on the Table.—<hi>Moriſe</hi> whiſpered ſomewhat to <hi>Sir Nicholas,</hi> who immediately cryed out, <q>Z—ns, that's true, D—my B—d if the Gentleman pays a Farthing in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</q>—<hi>Conyers</hi> begged to be excuſed; but the other inſiſting on paying the Whole, threw four Guineas to the Waiter. Mr. <hi>Moriſe</hi> took the Half Guinea, intreating Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> to put it up; which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily refuſing, <q>Well, <hi>ſaid Moriſe,</hi> 'tis only ſo much the more for the Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</q> however, in a Miſtake, he ſlipt it into his own Pocket.</p>
               <p>'TWAS paſt three o'Clock, and the Quiet of the Neighbourhood was to be invaded, the Company in the Street, each encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the other in the Expedition.—But my Duty calls me another Way, for Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> took the firſt Chair, and got ſafe to his Lodgings, without ſharing in the <hi>Honours</hi> or <hi>Danegrs</hi> of this glorious Action, and his Friend very ſoon followed his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

                  <hi>SANGFROID</hi> was rous'd about Six that Morning, by a thundering Rap at the Door. At Ten he return'd, and gave <hi>Conyers</hi> the Sequel to the Evening's Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.—<q>There has been fine Work, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> and our Heroes have furniſh'd me Employment. It ſeems they began their Attack on the Watchmen a little too precipitately, ſo were inſtantly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>number'd. The Battle laſted but a ſhort Time, and in the Hurry, the Major and Mr. <hi>Moriſe</hi> got off to a Bagnio, but moſt miſerably cut in the Head and Face.— The Valour of the young Knight not permitting him the proper Uſe of his Legs, he was taken Priſoner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Citadel of the Pariſh, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly

term'd the Round-Houſe. He is tolerably bruiſed, and has another ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Mark planted juſt over his Eye. Some of the Watch are ſlightly injur'd, but as they will make the moſt of it, this Affair, perhaps, may be made up at the trivial Expence of an Hundred Guineas.</q>
               </p>
               <p>'BUT, ſaid <hi>Conyers,</hi> what became of the other Gentleman? For methinks Mr. <hi>Fitzſimons</hi> is a Man of more Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than to embarque in ſuch an Exploit.' —'He <hi>(anſwer'd the Surgeon)</hi> ſlipp'd off with me, and whiſper'd, "He had no Idea of Fighting, where nothing but the Reverſe of Honour or Credit could poſſibly be obtain'd."—As for the City Blades, all I hear of them is, that they play'd their Parts very well for ſome Time, but had ſo much Prudence as not to be taken.'</p>
               <p>'I AM heartily glad, ſaid <hi>Conyers,</hi> that ſome have been properly puniſh'd; for their Conduct is ſo abſurd, that nothing can extenuate it, but imagining them Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick.'—'In truth, ſaid <hi>Sangfroid,</hi> the Watchmen treated them as ſuch, and blooded them ſeverely.—But what think you of their Humour?—'Humour! reply'd <hi>Conyers,</hi> Faith I find none, but

for Ribaldry, Folly, and Nonſenſe, I thank my Stars, I never heard nor ſaw more in my whole Life. I was quite ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and bore all their Extravagancies with ſome Patience, except their horrid Swearings, which really made me ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.'—'And yet, <hi>ſaid his Friend,</hi> ſuch is the general Run of Tavern-Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.'—'I am ſorry for it, anſwer'd <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers;</hi> but wonder what Joy, what Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Men can take, eſpecially old ones, in Riot and Exceſs! Company, and too much Wine, may ſometimes lead Men into a thouſand odd Frolicks, but a cool, deliberate Syſtem of Ignorance, Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Impiety, is what I can by no Means account for. Dean <hi>Swift,</hi> indeed, was not ſo much aſtoniſh'd at ſeeing Men wicked, as at their not being aſham'd of it.'—'That, ſaid <hi>Sangfroid,</hi> is really the moſt ſurprizing Circumſtance; but of our Companions, I can only ſay, as <hi>Killi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grew</hi> did of Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> "they would not ſwear at that abominable Rate, if they thought they were doing God Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.' Many Obſervations paſs'd, till the Surgeon told him, they would dine To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow with a Lady on the <hi>Surry</hi> Side, where poſſibly he might be more happily and more agreeably entertain'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0558800101:263"/>NEXT Day they took Boat. <q>The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>ſaid Sangfroid,</hi> we are going to viſit, was formerly call'd POLLY GUN, but lately POLLY CANNON, and has been what the World calls, <hi>One of Us.</hi> She has had her Share of Variety, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged ſo cleverly, as to have an Income of about Two Hundred Pounds a Year. She is now about Forty-five Years of Age, preſerves a Portion of Beauty, and has for theſe Four laſt Years retir'd from the Town, and lives a moſt regular and modeſt Life. She has been often in Keeping, but had always a Settlement by Way of Life-Annuity. I tranſact all her Affairs, and am on ſuch a Footing, that I hope to perſuade her to give you her Hiſtory. You'll be pleas'd with her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, for ſhe is extremely well-bred, and of a lively and chearful Turn.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THEY row'd up the River about Six Miles, <hi>Conyers</hi> ſtill enquiring into more Particulars, which furniſh'd <hi>Sangfroid</hi> with an Opportunity of deſcribing her Perſon, her Oeconomy, her Happineſs, and other Articles, till they landed. A Quarter of an Hour brought them to her Houſe: It was ſmall, but moſt neatly furniſh'd, with a Garden in nice Order. The firſt Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions over, Mrs. <hi>Cannon</hi> fell into the eaſy
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0558800101:264"/>
and familiar Stile. She very agreeably ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd the Magnificence of her Palace, the Elegance of the Apartments, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of the Saloon. As ſhe went through the few Rooms, ſhe made very merry Remarks.—'Now, Gentlemen, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> this is my Bed-Chamber, and contains ſomewhat ſcarcely to be found in any other.'—'I muſt own, Madam, ſaid <hi>Conyers,</hi> I never ſaw ſo truly a clean, neat, and charming an Apartment in my Life, but the <hi>Bed</hi> ſtrikes my Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the moſt.—What Joy, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent muſt Repoſe and Slumber find in it!'—'Oh, very fine, <hi>ſaid ſhe;</hi> but tho' your Gueſs is very true, permit me to ſet you Right in the Main.—This Bed, <hi>continued ſhe,</hi> I made myſelf, and have for theſe Four Years conſtantly ſlept in it as happily as I wiſh or deſire; but few Beds can boaſt, like this, of being never employ'd but merely to ſleep in.' —<hi>Sangfroid</hi> laugh'd, and <hi>Conyers</hi> ſmil'd. —'You may laugh, Gentlemen, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> yet Faith it is Fact.—But now let us go to the Library.' She then conducted them into a pretty contriv'd Cloſet, and ſhew'd about Three Hundred Volumes of Hiſtory, Poetry, and Books of Divinity.' —<q>I doubt not, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> but ſome great
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0558800101:265"/>
Perſonages may have a larger Collection, but perhaps they cannot ſay with me, that they have read all their's more than once over.—Yonder are the Claſſicks in good <hi>Engliſh.</hi>—You may examine them, if you pleaſe; for, I aſſure you, they are not in Wood, and deſign'd for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only.</q>—<hi>Conyers</hi> and the Surgeon found ſomething to ſay on every Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, nor did ſhe fail in very pertinent Replies.</p>
               <p>SHE then led them to her Garden:— 'Here, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> is the <hi>fair Flower in its Luſtre!</hi> What Pity to crop its growing Sweetneſs, <hi>then caſt it like a loathſome Weed away.</hi>'—'Pity, indeed, Madam, ſaid <hi>Conyers;</hi> but to tranſplant, to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it in <hi>your fair Garden, where the Sun always ſhines,</hi> has been your careful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; but however, to let it wither and periſh on the Stem, without ſmell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Fragrancy, is, perhaps, a Crime almoſt as bad. For my Part, I ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy its Perfume, and endeavour to keep it in conſtant Blow.'—'Yes, yes, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I never knew a young Fellow that did not imagine he'd make an excellent Gardener.—But here comes my Maid, and I prophecy Dinner is ready.'—As
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0558800101:266"/>
they walk'd to the Houſe, the Surgeon gave her a Whiſper.</p>
               <p>THE Repaſt was plain, but ſo neat, and enliven'd by ſuch Good Humour and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, that <hi>Conyers</hi> declar'd he never had ſo high an Entertainment.—<hi>Sangfroid</hi> put her in Mind of the Promiſe ſhe made him. —<q>Since, ſaid ſhe, your Friend Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> is ſo curious, I ſhall give him a Hiſtory, of which I make no great Secret.</q>

               <p>WHO, or what were my Parents, is of no Conſequence, only I muſt ſay they were People of Subſtance and Reputation, and moſt tenderly bred and educated me. I grew up like other Wenches; and at Fourteen, <hi>the flattering World had talk'd me into Beauty.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I really was ſo, but am ſure I
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0558800101:267"/>
thought it. About this Time, one Mr. <hi>Tarrier,</hi> and his Lady, took a furniſh'd Houſe in our Neighbourhood. The good Gentlewoman was mighty religious, and never fail'd at the Pariſh Church. She took a great Liking to my Father's Pew, and, by many little Civilities, was much regarded by our Family. She invited us to Supper, and was invited in Return. In a Word, her Converſation was ſo pious and godly, and ſhe inveigh'd ſo much againſt the Wickedneſs and Vices of the preſent Age, that my poor Parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo fond of, and intimate with her, that they intreated ſhe would be ſo good to inſtruct their dear <hi>Polly.</hi> I own I was not much pleas'd with my Tutoreſs, for ſhe conſtantly trail'd me to Church twice a-Day. My good Mother thank'd God ſhe had found ſo good a Friend; but I ſoon diſcover'd that Madam <hi>Tarrier</hi> was not ſo outrageouſly rigid as I expected; for ſhe ſometimes perſuaded them to permit me to a Play. The pious Lady always choſe a Comedy, and in ſome Parts, where I was ignorant of the Joke, ſhe very kindly explain'd, perhaps more than the Author meant.</p>
               <p>IN this Manner we lived for about Half a Year, and the good Woman had got
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0558800101:268"/>
ſuch an Aſcendancy over my Mother, that I believe ſhe would have truſted me with her even to <hi>America.</hi> She frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took me to viſit her Uncle near <hi>Groſve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor-Square.</hi> He was a very polite, rich old Gentleman, and ſo kind to me, that I was always ſure of ſome pretty Preſent, or a Guinea or two to buy Ribbands. At one, and the laſt of theſe Viſits, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Tarrier</hi> took the Opportunity of leaving me with her Uncle, that ſhe might attend her Devotions at a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Church. I thought ſhe ſtaid a little too long, and began to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. The old Gentleman endeavoured to paſs away the Time with a Chat fitting my Years, but at laſt I could not refrain crying moſt bitterly.—What need I amuſe you with unneceſſary Particulars?—The <hi>She Devil</hi> had left me with an <hi>He one,</hi> and I was undone.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Month of my Confinement, for I was conſtantly watch'd, was dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to my Imagination. I moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately lov'd my Father and Mother, and felt their Sufferings at the Loſs of an only Child. I wept almoſt Day and Night, but muſt ſay the old Gentleman was extremely tender and fond, and did all in his Power to make my Life eaſy.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0558800101:269"/>
He bought me Books, we read by Turns, and he gave me that Sort of Taſte and Reliſh for them, which I now find of infinite Uſe. I play'd on the Harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſichord, and ſung well; but he had a Maſter to perfect me and amuſe my lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Hours. I inſenſibly began to be better pleas'd with my Station, and in Twelve Months was quite reconciled to it.</p>
               <p>WHAT an Animal is Man! — As I grew happy and fond of the Wretch, his Affections cool'd, and he entirely changed his Conduct. At laſt he upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me with Infidelity (which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible) and proved his Aſſertions by my injuring his Health. He ſtorm'd and flew into a violent Paſſion; and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Man <hi>Jenkins,</hi> "Here, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> take this fair Lady, get her a Lodging and a Surgeon, which I ſhall pay; but ſince ſhe has found out a <hi>Trade,</hi> all ſhe can expect of me, is to <hi>ſet her up.</hi>"— Without giving me Time to reply, he ſtepp'd into his Chariot and vaniſhed. — I was ſtruck dumb; and tho' my Heart was ready to burſt, no friendly Tear aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted me. Poor <hi>Jenkins</hi> was in great Perplexity; but one of the Maids having pack'd up all my Linen and Cloaths, of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0558800101:270"/>
which I had Abundance, and very fine, he was obliged to execute the Orders of his Maſter, and conducted me to the Door, where an Hackney Coach ſtood ready to receive me.</p>
               <p>AS I was paſſing the Hall, I don't know what perſuaded me to open the Parlour Door; but what was my Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, when I ſaw Mrs. <hi>Tarrier,</hi> and a charming young Creature, in cloſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation!—I ſtood motionleſs, but in Agony, and with uplifted Eyes, I juſt utter'd—<hi>Infamous Woman!</hi> and fell in a Swoon.—The Servants too charitably brought me to myſelf, and <hi>Jenkins</hi> rather carried, than led me to the Coach.</p>
               <p>WHEN we got to the Lodging he had provided for me, I flew to the Bed and abandon'd myſelf to Tears, Sighs, and the moſt melancholy Reflections.—Good God! ſaid I, is there no <hi>Law,</hi> no <hi>Juſtice</hi> for the Injuries done me? Muſt I ſuffer in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and muſt triumphant Villany go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed!—Is the Nature of <hi>Woman</hi> ſo harden'd, and the Conſcience of Man ſo ſteel'd, as not to feel the utmoſt Remorſe for this <hi>worſe than Rape?</hi>—Bitter, very bitter were my Words, and <hi>Jenkins</hi> try'd all Means to aſſuage the Violence of my Paſſion. At length I became more calm,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0558800101:271"/>
and he promiſed to wait on me in the Morning. The Woman of the Houſe obliged me to eat a little, and was very civil and tender.</p>
               <p>NEXT Day <hi>Jenkins</hi> came and brought a Surgeon. When alone he began to queſtion and examine me in the delicate Manner, and then declared I was injured in a high Degree.—'Twould be tedious to mention all this Affair; let it ſuffice, that I was perfectly recover'd in two Months.—As I could not accuſe myſelf of a real Crime, I reſolv'd, if poſſible, to return to my Parents, not doubting but they would receive me, and revenge my Wrongs. With proper Caution I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded my Landlady to make ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after them; but, Good Heavens! What were my Sufferings whilſt ſhe gave me the following Account?—"I have done, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> what you have deſir'd, and find that the Family I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd after, had a beautiful Daughter who was ſtolen from them about a Year ago by a Bawd, who, as a Neighbour, got into their Favour, but decamp'd the Moment ſhe finiſhed her horrid Work. The poor Mother was ſo griev'd at the Loſs of her Child, that ſhe fell into a Decay, and died in Half a Year. The
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0558800101:272"/>
Father, with Difficulty, got the better of his Afflictions, but ſold all his Effects, and went Abroad, but where I could not learn. I aſſure you, Madam, that Family are greatly pity'd by all the Neighbours."—'My Situation is not to be deſcribed.— Now, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> the worſt has happen'd.—My dear Mother is dead, —My Father gone, — and I muſt be abandon'd to the Fate of a Proſtitute!— But what ſignifies what becomes of me?</p>
               <p>JENKINS juſt then enter'd, and, after ſome Chat, told me my Lodgings and Surgeon were paid; "and now, <hi>Polly,</hi> ſaid he, your old Friend ſends you theſe Fifty Guineas, and adviſes you to take Care of yourſelf."—I took the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but vented on the old Villain every Name, and every Imprecation my Rage could ſuggeſt.—"Come, come, <hi>ſaid Jenkins,</hi> of what Uſe is all this? You muſt now think of providing a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and if you'll be advis'd by me, perhaps Things may go better than you imagine. You are certainly a fine Girl, and ſome Gentlemen would think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy in your Acquaintance. If you'll give me leave, I'll engage you ſhall not want two or three very liberal Friends.—You underſtand me."—I
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0558800101:273"/>
was really, in ſuch a Temper of Mind, and thought my Situation ſo deſperate, that I did not reflect on the Miſery I was going to plunge my ſelf into, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be guided by him and fell into his Project with a Sort of Stupidity that I never could account for.</p>
               <p>JENKINS got me noble Lodgings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſituated and gave me his Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but, like other Dealers, I gave him a Sample of the <hi>Goods.</hi> He had the Benefit of a Subſcriber for Six Copies, by having the Seventh <hi>Gratis.</hi> He was a notable Broker, and ſent many good Cuſtomers to my <hi>Ware-houſe.</hi>—In Six Months POLLY GUN began to be famous, and my Lodgings were ſometimes the Scene of Quarrels and Noiſe, eſpecially at Night. In ſhort, <hi>Diſgraces had knock'd too frequently at my Door,</hi> and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood oblig'd me to ſhift my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>IN three Years I believe I had thirty different Apartments, good and bad, juſt as the Ballance of Trade was <hi>For</hi> or <hi>Againſt</hi> me. 'Tis an odd Sort of Fund, for when <hi>Stock</hi> was <hi>low,</hi> I mounted to a Second or Third Story; when <hi>high,</hi> I deſcended to the Firſt Floor. I had not ſeen <hi>Jenkins</hi> for ſome Time, ſo preſume
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0558800101:274"/>
he was inſtructing other Wenches whom his Maſter had made as wretched as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—By this Time ſome of my Cloaths were worn out, and many had viſited the Pawn-Brokers.—I was frequented but by Lovers of the <hi>trifling Order.</hi>—I had not ſaved a Shilling, and wanted many Neceſſaries in my Profeſſion, beſides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indebted a Month's Lodging. In this Diſtreſs my Maid perſuaded me to be acquainted with the Porters of two or three noted Taverns.—To theſe Places I was frequently ſent for, and now took the Name of POLLY CANNON. The Novelty of my Face, my Converſation, which was always decent, my Voice, and my Youth and Compexion, furniſh'd out a good or rather a bad Livelihood. The Porters were fond to promote my Intereſt, as I greatly promoted theirs.</p>
               <p>THESE Gentlemen always charg'd a Shilling for my Chair hire to the Tavern, and another if I return'd alone to my Lodgings, tho' I was oblig'd to walk.

                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0558800101:275"/>EVEN this Sort of Life at laſt fail'd me; for my Face grew too familiar, which is an unpardonable Crime amongſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; and my biting the Porters out of their juſt Poundage, and refuſing ſome certain Compliances which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard as their Prerogative, they left me to pick my Teeth in my Chamber, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver invited poor <hi>Polly Cannon</hi> to a good Supper.</p>

               <p>ONE Night as I took my Rounds, I touch'd a young Gentleman, and in the uſual Phraſe, aſk'd for a Pint of Wine. He turn'd, and by the Aſſiſtance of a Lamp, examined me a little, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.— "Perhaps, Child, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> you are more Hungry than Dry."—On my telling him he gueſs'd right, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a Supper.—Our Converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very diverting, and he was ſo good to ſay, I was much above the Common. He deſired my Story, and I gave it him very naturally, but concluded, that as all
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0558800101:277"/>
poor Girls were fertile in Invention, I much doubted if he credited my Tale.— He look'd ſerious, but from pitying he became amorous, and preſſed my going to a Bagnio.—Wretched as I am, <hi>Sir, ſaid I,</hi> I cannot do a Wilful Injury. You are happy and in Health, but I am mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable every Way.—When he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth of what I ſaid, he took me in his Arms, and vowed he would never forget my Generoſity.— Take, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> theſe Five Guineas, and meet me To-morrow Morning in <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-Gardens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>YOU may be ſure I was punctual, and indeed he was exact. In fine, he carried me to the Houſe of a Surgeon, where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained until his Duty was over. My Friend, whoſe Name was <hi>Loveit,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me to a private Family, where, in a ſhort Time, with good Living and tolerable Content of Mind, I recovered my former Spirits, my Complexion, and every Sign of Youth, for I was not yet quite One-and-Twenty.—If ever I lov'd a Man it was this dear Friend, and he merited all my Regard.</p>
               <p>WITH this Gentleman I lived near three Years, and as happily as my Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could admit of. I recover'd my
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0558800101:278"/>
Muſick and my Taſte in Books, and greatly improved in both.—One Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Breakfaſt he walked about the Room, and ſeem'd very penſive. On my enquiring the Cauſe, he ſat down by me and began thus.—"I hope, my dear <hi>Polly</hi> believes I love her as I ought, but all Things muſt have an End.—Don't be too much alarm'd, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> on ſeeing my my Tears,—I ſhall act with Honour, and to your Satisfaction. — In two Words, <hi>Polly,</hi> my Friends and my real Intereſt compel me to <hi>marry.</hi>"—Be happy, Sir, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> in the Choice of a Wife, and may every Bleſſing attend you.' —'What remains for me but Diſpair, Anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety and Madneſs.—"Not ſo, my dear <hi>Polly, cry'd he,</hi> for I hope a better Fate attends you. Here are <hi>One Hundred</hi> Guineas, and this Paper intitles you to an Annuity of <hi>Forty Pounds a Year.</hi> Be careful of theſe and be happy.</p>
               <p>HIS Generoſity charmed me, and by Degrees he calmed my troubled Spirits, and brought me to talk of parting with more Coolneſs of Temper than I poſſibly could have imagined.—"Since we muſt ſeparate, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> take a little of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. My Couſin, Captain <hi>Mizen,</hi> of the <hi>Superb</hi> Man of War, has ſeen and

likes you. As he knows all my Affairs, he begs to be admitted to your good Graces. The Captain is an Old Bluff Tar, and tho' not very polite and tender, yet he's an hearty honeſt Fellow. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I will engage a Settlement of Thirty Pounds, beſides your living as you have hitherto done."—Some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation enſued, and at laſt I accepted the Propoſal.</p>
               <p>THE Evening was uſhered in by a Viſit from Captain <hi>Mizen,</hi> who was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Mr. <hi>Loveit.</hi> I received them with great Reſpect, and made many Compliments for the Praiſes beſtowed on me by my Friend.—"S'blood, ſaid the Captain, what's all this <hi>Jawing</hi> for? I've done as Coz deſired, and o'has the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in's Pocket. Now d'ye ſee, an it be too little, there's twenty Pieces more to turn the Scale.—Now, Miſtreſs, how ſay you? ſhall we make the Bargain and ſeal Lips."—<hi>Loveit</hi> ſmiled, but I was mute.—"Well, well, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence gives Conſent, ſo Miſtreſs, by your Leave."—He kiſs'd moſt furiouſly, and then turning to <hi>Loveit,</hi> ſaid, — S'blood Coz, ſhe's a well built Sloop, and will carry a huge deal of Cavas;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0558800101:280"/>
I'm afraid I ſhall never be able to run her fairly down.</p>
               <p>WE had much of this Sort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but Mr. <hi>Loveit</hi> came to the Point, and his giving me another Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Thirty Pounds,</hi> I own it prejudiced me greatly in Favour of Captain <hi>Mizen.</hi> A few more Words finiſhed this Affair, and I became the Property of this <hi>Man of War,</hi> and parted with my Friend with Love and Regret.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN <hi>Mizen</hi> viſited conſtantly, but ſeldom before One or Two in the Morning, and frequently <hi>Half Seas over,</hi> as he called it. 'Twas difficult to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage him in this <hi>Trim;</hi> but when quite drunk, was very tame and obedient, ſo I took Care to ply him with Port or Punch, and then <hi>he turned in</hi> with Eaſe. In the Morning he always begged Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, not in Words, but in a <hi>pecuniary</hi> Manner, that carry'd irreſiſtable Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I certainly hated him, and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance</hi> I always made to his Careſſes, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but to plague me the more with his Fondneſs. The Creature loved, and no <hi>Caliban</hi> could ſhew it more. I was his <hi>Pinnace,</hi> his <hi>Frigate,</hi> and a Thouſand tender Names, but on ſtruggling he has cry'd out'—"That's right!—<hi>Yard-arm</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0558800101:281"/>
and <hi>Yard-arm.</hi>—S'blood <hi>Poll,</hi> an you blow me up, by the World I'll clap the broad R on you.</p>
               <p>AT laſt my <hi>true Love went to Sea,</hi> and gave me a Reprieve for ſix Months. The Experience I had, made me find out the real Uſe of Money, and reſolve to ſave as much as I could. The Captain returned with a freſh Cargo of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity which his Love made leſs valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. He was ſo generous, that I ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Embraces with great Freedom, but diſcovered the lucky Secret, that this was the only Chance I had of loſing his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Heart. It ſeems he loved a ſmart Engagement, and a Ship that would take <hi>a good Deal of Drubbing</hi> before ſhe ſtruck. An eaſy Conqueſt was to him of no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. With this Knowledge I pretended extreme Fondneſs; I hung on his Neck; I kiſs'd his Carbuncled Cheeks, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cryed when he left me. He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pleaſed enough with my Behaviour, but his Viſits were leſs frequent, and in ſix Months he forfeited his Articles, gave me the Good-bye, and <hi>left me like a Turtle all alone, to weep and mourn the Abſence of her Mate.</hi>

               <p>MY Landlady, Mrs. <hi>Wheedle,</hi> was a Woman who underſtood the World. In
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0558800101:282"/>
her younger Days ſhe had been of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Uſe</hi> to a Nobleman, who married her to his Footman, and procured him a very pretty Employ in the <hi>Revenue.</hi> Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, I believe, ſhe ſerved his Lordſhip in another Capacity. With theſe People I lived, and, all Things conſidered, was perfectly happy in the Friendſhip of Mrs. <hi>Wheedle.</hi> We went to Church, to Play-Houſes, and were inſeparable. In one of our Walks, I took it in my Head to enquire for my <hi>Old Friend</hi> near <hi>Groſvenor Square,</hi> of whom I had not heard for above ſix Years. Mrs. <hi>Wheedle</hi> went to the Houſe, but found it inhabited by another Family. With ſome Difficulty I was informed, that the Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's whole Fortune was ſwallowed up in the <hi>South Sea.</hi> That his Diſtreſs was ſo great, that it turned his Head, and had been ſupported by <hi>Charity</hi> in a <hi>Mad-houſe</hi> near <hi>Chelſea,</hi> where he died about a Year ago.—I had no great Reaſon to love his Memory, yet could I not help a few Tears, but guarded againſt calling his <hi>Fate</hi> a <hi>juſt Judgment.</hi>

at Home, my Dear, but nothing is to be got by <hi>Idleneſs.</hi> I love to ſee a young Woman <hi>Induſtrious</hi> and <hi>Careful.</hi> 'Tis the moſt <hi>recommendableſt</hi> Thing in Life.'—'I am no Enemy, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> to Induſtry, but ſure you would not have me hawk about my <hi>Goods,</hi> or ſtand at the Door and cry,—<hi>Walk in Gentlemen! and behold the wonderful Works of Nature! Alive—Alive—ho!</hi>—"Certainly <hi>Polly, ſaid ſhe,</hi> you're diſtracted!—Did ever any Body hear ſuch Nonſenſe?— If you will be induſtrious, I know a Friend will give you Employment." —Ay marry, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> now you ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but will he <hi>come down</hi> handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? for you know I hate a <hi>Game</hi> that can't afford paying the Cards.—"Lord, Lord, <hi>Polly, ſaid ſhe,</hi> you're ſtrangely covetous! but I don't blame you neither. —There's 'Squire CARELESS now, the <hi>moſt Charmingeſt</hi> and <hi>moſt Agreeableſt</hi> Man <hi>in Life,</hi> mayhap he may anſwer your Purpoſe.—What ſay to that, <hi>Polly?</hi>" —With all my Heart, ſaid I, the Squire ſhall be welcome, but you know the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>IN a few Days Mr. <hi>Careleſs</hi> paid me a Viſit, and, with great Eaſe and Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, fell into a Chat of a Settlement,—

I'm ſo unlucky my Dear, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> to have my Eſtate ſo fix'd by Law, that I cannot touch it.

               <p>HIS Viſits were very irregular, but, tho' always chearful, always good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd and generous, they ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paid to diſpoſe of, and <hi>kill Time,</hi> than to ſee the Object of his Love.— Mrs. <hi>Wheedle</hi> took Notice of this, and inſinuated, <hi>that vacant Hours might be employed to Advantage.</hi>—"There <hi>is</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> belonging to all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments <hi>in Life,</hi> and ſince you keep an <hi>Office,</hi> I ſee no Reaſon why you ſhou'dn't have 'em as well as others."— If I keep an <hi>Office, ſaid I,</hi> it is an Office of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> or rather, that of an <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writer;</hi> but where are the Perquiſites you talk of? for I always admir'd your

               <p>CARELESS ſometimes met one of theſe Gentlemen in my Chamber, but ſeem'd quite indifferent about it. The Indolence of his Temper was ſuch, that no jealous Thoughts had Power to give him Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. I once made an Apology for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Stranger in my Apartment, and told him a well-contriv'd Lye.— "Bleſs me, Child, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> why ſo many Words about a Trifle!—I know you are a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and cannot help acting as ſuch.— I know you have been playing the <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</hi> but why ſhould I be angry at the conſtant Practice of your Sex?
