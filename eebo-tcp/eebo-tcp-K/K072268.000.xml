            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>RUPTURES of the uterus have been conſidered as accidents, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, for the moſt part, in their nature. When part of the child remains <hi>in ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> authors give ſome general directions for delivery; but agree in its fatal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, if the child has eſcaped wholly into the cavity of the abdomen; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering any attempts to deliver, except by the caeſarean operation, as fruitleſs. This was the opinion of Dr. Hunter: his high and deſerved reputation has ſtampt ſuch authority upon it, that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners in general give up their patient for loſt, without attempting any thing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0209900400:3"/>for her relief. The caeſarian operation, in this country, has been attended with ſuch ill ſucceſs, that very few men are bold enough to recommend it, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that it would only be an addition to the patient's ſufferings, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording any proſpect of relief.</p>
            <p>Dr. Douglas, phyſician to the Aſylum, ſome months ſince, publiſhed a caſe, where he ſucceeded in the delivery of a child from the cavity of the abdomen, and the woman recovered; from whence he infers, that thoſe accidents, which admit the child to eſcape through a rupture of the uterus, are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fatal, and that the delivery is to be effected, without having recourſe to the caeſarean operation, with more eaſe than has been imagined.</p>
            <p>The caſe, which is now ſubmitted to the conſideration of the public, was a laceration of the vagina, happening early in parturition: the circumſtances
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0209900400:4"/>of which having been clearly marked during the life of the patient, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by diſſection after her death, throws a new light upon this part of midwifery, and renders it probable that many caſes deemed irremediable, from being conſidered as ruptures of the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, were only lacerations of the vagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and admitted of effectual aſſiſtance from art.</p>
            <p>This caſe, having given riſe to many doubts upon the ſubject of ruptured uterus, induced me to enquire how far authors in general have been accurate in their obſervations. Upon examining ſuch caſes as were in my poſſeſſion, I found, that many which are related as ruptures of the uterus, were in fact, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerations of the vagina. Inſtances of which I ſhall give in caſes from Vander Wiel, Bonetus, Dr. Douglas, Pouteau, and others.</p>
            <p>From a caſe communicated to me by a friend, I am further enabled to give
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0209900400:5"/>ſome account of the circumſtances at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a laceration of the vagina, when, the head being ſo low as to be wedged in the pelvis, the child did not eſcape into the cavity of the abdomen. On examining the circumſtances of ſome caſes deſcribed as proceeding from rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the uterus, this appears ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to have happened without being diſcovered.</p>
            <p>The obſervations annexed, reſpecting the circumſtances in which lacerations of the vagina differ from ruptures of the uterus; in the eſcape of the child or placenta into the abdomen, and the obſtructions to delivery; and the other practical inferences drawn, are ſuch as, I hope, will merit the attention of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners.</p>
            <p>As Dr. Douglas's obſervations on an extraordinary caſe of ruptured uterus, is the lateſt publication on the ſubject, I ſhall have occaſion to advert to it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0209900400:6"/>oftener than to any other. If it has been any means of diſpelling the idea of the impoſſibility of recovery in acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of this nature, which has ſo long been the general received opinion, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the higheſt authorities; I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, that the following pages will be a further inducement to diſpel our fears; as they tend to prove the great probability there is, that the eſcape of the child into the cavity of the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men happens oftener from lacerations of the vagina, than from ruptures of the uterus.</p>

               </gap>N EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF LACERATED VAGINA.</head>
            <p>ON Auguſt the 20th, 1786, I was deſired by Mr. William Waller, of Goſport, to viſit Mrs. Wilkins, with my partner Mr. Aylward. She was a patient of Mr. Waller's, and had been above twenty four hours in labour; after the membranes had broke, and the os internum been conſiderably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, the labour pains ſuddenly went off; the child's head could be no longer felt, and very dangerous ſymptoms had come on. We met there, in conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his father and Dr. Waller.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0209900400:8"/>
            <p>Mrs. Wilkins was a large woman, much uſed to laborious exerciſe, of a dark complexion, about thirty-ſix years of age, inclining to be luſty; her conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was naturally ſtrong, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healthy; ſhe was then in labour with her fourth child; her former labours had been always lingering, but was, at each time, delivered of a living child, without more than ordinary aſſiſtance. During the preſent pregnancy, ſhe was not able to move with ſo much eaſe as with her former children, complaining of much pain in the left hypogaſtrium.</p>
            <p>We were informed by Mr. Waller, that he was called to her aſſiſtance about a fortnight before; but finding that the pains were ſpurious, he ordered her an opiate, which gave her relief, and ſhe continued eaſy until the preceding day; when being again ſent to, about ſix o'clock in the morning, he then found her in labour; after waiting ſome time, the pains beginning to encreaſe, he made
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0209900400:9"/>an examination, and found that the os internum was dilated to the ſize of a crown piece. The membranes broke, and the waters were evacuated. Upon a further examination in the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the head was found to preſent; but being only able to reach it with the point of his finger, he could not exactly aſcertain its ſituation, in reſpect to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex or fontinel. Conſidering it a linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing labour, he waited for the efforts of nature. The child's head advanced by ſlow degrees; and, after ſome hours, the proſpect of a more ſpeedy delivery ſeemed to be apparent, by the further dilatation of the os internum, although the head did not appear to be much engaged in the pelvis. She was, about this time, ſeized with a cramp in her left foot and leg, which afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to her belly, on the return of every pain. While he was directing a camphorated anodyne liniment, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſevere pain came on, which cauſed her to cry out moſt vehemently, oh the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0209900400:10"/>cramp, the cramp! and which, ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſaid, ſhe believed was in her womb: this was ſoon after followed by a diſcharge of blood from the vagina, which continued for ſome time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Waller then obſerved that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour pains abated in their ſtrength, and that they were ſucceeded by ſuch as are common in colic, with peculiar twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her bowels. He directed an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient glyſter, which was repeated with an anodyne; but not finding ſo much relief from theſe as he expected, her pulſe being full and quick, he took away about eight ounces of blood from her arm, and left her about two o'clock, giving directions, that ſhe might be kept as cool as poſſible, the weather being very warm.</p>
            <p>He ſaw her again, between four and five o'clock, and found that the true labour pains had not returned; but that, in addition to the other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0209900400:11"/>ſhe then complained of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thirſt; had vomited frequently; was very reſtleſs; in great pain when moved, and felt a great degree of pain when he put his hand upon her belly. Upon examining the ſtate of the labour, he could feel no preſentation, the child's head having receded. In this ſituation, he thought it proper to repeat the glyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ordered her, in the evening, another anodyne, together with a ſaline julep. With hopes that real and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient pains would return by the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he left her.</p>
            <p>On viſiting her in the morning, very early, her attendants informed him, that ſhe had been very thirſty and reſtleſs all night; her vomiting had been more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and that ſhe was in great pain when turned, complaining of a heavy lump which ſell from ſide to ſide; it did not appear from an inſpection of the cloths, that there had been any fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther hemorrhage; upon inquiring more
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0209900400:12"/>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, it could not be found that ſhe had made any urine, except as it came away involuntarily.</p>
            <p>On conſidering that there had been no return of real pains, and that the other ſymptoms were more urgent, he began to think that her caſe was of a more ſerious nature than he had at firſt apprehended; he therefore thought it proper, to acquaint her friends with the opinion he entertained of the danger of her ſituation, requeſting them to ſend for ſuch other perſons of the faculty as they might wiſh ſhould be conſulted.</p>
            <p>When we viſited her, which was about noon, we found her extremely reſtleſs, complaining of great pain about the region of the pubis; her face was covered with a cold ſweat; her pulſe was moderately full and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid; ſhe felt great anxiety about the praecordia; her breathing was thick and ſhort, with intenſe thirſt, and continual
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0209900400:13"/>efforts to vomit. As it was obſerved that ſhe had made no water for ſome time, except what, by the urinous ſmell of the cloths, appeared to have come away involuntarily, we determined to introduce the catheter; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſſed, except a little bloody ſanies. The bleeding was repeated, and an antiphlogiſtic treatment agreed upon.</p>
            <p>When we conſidered her ſituation more fully, and compared the ſeveral ſymptoms, of cramp and ſucceeding hemorrhage; the retroceſſion of the child; her ſevere thirſt; vomiting and great pain about the region of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, with the ſymptoms which occurred in the caſe of ruptured uterus publiſhed by Dr. Douglas; there was ſuch ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity between them, that we agreed in the propriety of introducing the hand for a more particular examination.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0209900400:14"/>
            <p>We accordingly viſited her again about three o'clock, and Mr. William Waller proceeded to make an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. There was no difficulty in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his hand: upon the poſterior part he felt a conſiderable tumor, which was moveable, and which was not the child's head: he likewiſe found his hand in contact with the inteſtines; whence it was evident that our ſuſpicions were well grounded. Immediate delivery was the only means of relief, and his endeavours to get at the feet ſoon ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; they were brought into the vagina, and ſecured with a nooſe; but it required a conſiderable degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion to diſengage the breech. After the arms were brought down, the head followed with eaſe, little or no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge enſuing.</p>
            <p>The child was large, and had been dead, no doubt, ever ſince its eſcape from the uterus. The placenta, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0209900400:15"/>was likewiſe in the cavity of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, followed without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p>Not being determined as to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the tumor, which Mr. Waller felt upon the poſterior part; as the woman had ſuffered ſo little in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, we concurred in opinion, that he ſhould again examine the ſtate of the parts. Upon introducing his hand, he ſoon ſound that the tumor receded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fingers, and that it was the contracted uterus. It was evident to him that the uterus was not ruptured; but that there was a laceration of the vagina, at the place where it is attached to the <hi>cervix uteri,</hi> through which his hand would paſs with eaſe into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the abdomen. The os internum was ſo contracted, that it would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit more than two fingers, and he was convinced that it had not been injured. She ſound herſelf conſiderably relieved when we leſt her at four o'clock. An
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0209900400:16"/>anodyne was directed to be taken in the evening.</p>
            <p>— 21ſt.—We viſited her early in the morning, when we found that her ſpirits were good. Her attendants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, that ſhe had paſſed a much better night than could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. She was capable of turning without any inconvenience; her thirſt, pain in the abdomen, and vomiting, were ſtill violent. Anodynes, with ſalt of wormwood and lemon juice, to be taken during the efferveſcence, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for her. She had frequent ſtools with teneſmus. The nurſe was ordered to let her drink be mint tea with rice gruel.</p>
            <p>The ſymptoms evidently ariſing from the injury done to the abdominal viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera, by the child's remaining ſo long among them, after its eſcape from the uterus, induced us to entertain ſome rays of hope, from the ſucceſs which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0209900400:17"/>had attended the caſe related by Dr. Douglas, that ſhe might recover; but the approach of the evening convinced us that our hopes were groundleſs. Every ſymptom was become more ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, with a very diſtreſſing ſenſe of ſuffocation from globus hyſtericus; ſhe had made no water, and, from the uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſmell of the cloths, we could not entertain the leaſt doubt but that the bladder was ruptured, ſpecially when we called to our recollection, that the ſame had been obſerved before delivery.</p>
            <p>In this diſtreſſing ſtate, nothing was leſt for us to do, more than to alleviate her pain, and make the ſmall remainder of her life as eaſy as poſſible; for which purpoſe, her anodyne medicines were repeated.</p>
            <p>—22d.—The perſons who watched with her during the night informed us, that ſhe had been very reſtleſs; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of great pain in her belly, with

Her countenance was greatly altered; the quantity of fluid thrown up was out of all propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the quantity drank; the teneſmus ſtill continued, but without any evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; her anodynes were repeated, and an opiate glyſter ordered to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the evening.</p>
            <p>—23d.—We found her more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and we underſtood ſhe had been ſo through the greater part of the night. She continued in the ſame ſtate until about eleven o'clock before noon, when ſhe died, perfectly ſenſible.</p>
            <p>We obtained permiſſion to open the body the ſame evening.</p>
            <p>The abdomen was much tumified. Upon making a longitudinal inciſion through the integuments, a quantity of confined air ruſhed out. The perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum was inflamed, and in ſome places beginning to ſphacelate. The inteſtines
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0209900400:19"/>were remarkably diſtended with flatus; their external coats were tinged with yellow, and inflamed through their whole extent. The ramifications of the veſſels appeared of a beautiful red, as if they had been injected; ſome ſpots were obſerved in ſeveral places beginning to ſphacelate, and they were for the moſt part connected by a ſlight adheſion to each other. The omentum was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and inflamed. There was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of bloody ſerum in the cavity of the abdomen. The whole of the viſcera had that appearance, which has been generally obſerved on diſſecting women who have died of a puerperal fever.</p>
            <p>The uterus and its appendages, in ſitu, appeared perfectly ſound, excepting the left ovarium, which contained about fourteen ounces of a colourleſs fluid, in a ſingle cyſt. There was no appearance of the <hi>veſica urinaria;</hi> on paſſing a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter, it went immediately into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0209900400:20"/>of the abdomen, confirming our ſuſpicion that the bladder was ruptured. On raiſing the uterus above the pelvis, we were immediately convinced how accurate Mr. Waller had been in the deſcription he gave us, on examining the ſtate of the parts directly after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</p>
            <p>The os internum and cervix uteri were uninjured; the vagina was thin, and was lacerated tranſverſely on the ſuperior part, cloſe to its attachment to the uterus: the laceration was nearly through one half of its circumference, on the fore part, but inclining to the left ſide. The bladder, from its connexion with the vagina, had ſuffered at the ſame time, being ruptured through the whole of its poſterior part, at leaſt in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſize of the laceration which had taken place in the vagina; we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that it had extended to the outer ſurface of the uterus, tearing off an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular piece of its peritoneal coat, about
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0209900400:21"/>half an inch in length. The uterus was contracted to the uſual ſize it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be, in ſo ſhort a ſpace after delivery; its peritoneal coat near the fundus ſhewed an appearance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As the nature of the caſe was evident, we did not proceed further in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, but contented ourſelves with preſerving the parts. On making an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion into the uterus, it was found, in moſt places, to be nearly an inch thick; its internal ſurface appearing in a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſtate, and contained a ſmall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the membrana decidua, which had been left behind.</p>

            <p>LACERATIONS of the vagina have been mentioned by authors, as, ſometimes, happening from labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parturition; but I do not recollect to have heard, or read any account, where the child had eſcaped, by ſuch means, into the cavity of the abdomen; or that they have ever conceived ſuch an accident to be probable. I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſome caſes, which are related as ruptures of the uterus, but which are apparently accidents of this nature. Thus can be reconciled, only, by the confuſion into which authors have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, in their diviſions of this viſcus.</p>
            <p>Anatomiſts, at preſent, are pretty nearly agreed in dividing the uterus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fundus, cervix, and os internum. Suppoſing that the whole of the uterus meaſures three inches in length, they,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0209900400:23"/>for the moſt part, allow the fundus to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy the ſpace of one inch and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the cervix to take up one inch and three quarters, and the os internum to project within the vagina about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an inch. But, when we conſider how indeterminate they have heretofore been on this ſubject, we ſhall not be ſurpriſed, on examining ſome of the following caſes, which are related as ruptures of the cervix, to find them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerations of the vagina. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current teſtimony of writers, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the vagina has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conſidered as the <hi>collum uteri.</hi>

               <p>A Caſe of lacerated, vagina from <hi>VAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER WEIL,</hi> related, by him as a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the uterus.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE daughter of Jonas Pergo had been delivered of four children, having very difficult labours with all of them. While pregnant with the fifth, ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a conſiderable degree of uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; her pains were much more ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, when in labour, and came on earlier than in her former pregnancies, continuing with violence until the third day before delivery, when they ceaſed. The midwife could not, by any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, deliver her. The child, which was ſuppoſed to have been dead ſome
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0209900400:26"/>days, and which appeared afterwards to have been the caſe, from the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cuticle, preſented with its hands bent behind its neck, and the face obliquely upwards towards the pubis.</p>
            <p>The ſymptoms becoming more and more violent, ſhe being not only faint and feveriſh, with oppreſſion on the praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, attended with rigors; but having vomited up ſome green faeces, which aroſe, he ſays, from the foetus preſſing upon the rectum, ſo that they could not find their paſſage thence, Cornelius Solingius, an experienced ſurgeon, was ſent for with him to her relief. In a ſhort time, he delivered her of a dead child. As he could not eaſily bring away the after birth, he introduced his hand along the funis, but found that it was in contact with the inteſtines, before it came to the placenta; which was ſound, ſoon after, hanging down, in three parts, within the abdomen, out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0209900400:27"/>of the uterus. From the child having been expelled three days, the uterus was ſo hard and contracted, that, at firſt, he ſuppoſed it to be a ſcirrhus. He ſeparated the placenta from the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, to which, he ſays, it ſtill adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The cartilage, which connected the bones of the pelvis, was ſoft, and they were ſeparated from each other nearly the breadth of a finger.</p>
            <p>The woman died the ſame day, and the body was opened on the next, in the preſence of Vander Weil and his brother.</p>
            <p>The abdomen was much tumified. On making an inciſion into it, nothing eſcaped except a quantity of foetid air, and ſome coagulated blood of a good colour, which came, he ſays, from the cotyledons, or mouths of the veſſels of the uterus, at the time when the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa was detached from it. He paſſed his hand through the vagina, and again
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0209900400:28"/>found himſelf in contact with the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, the uterus receding above the pubis. A rupture was obſerved at the inferior and poſterior part, juſt above the os internum, at that place where the common membrane from the peritone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um covers and ſurrounds the uterus, as well as the rectum; through which rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the whole of the child, except the parts which preſented, had paſſed into the cavity of the abdomen. This he aſſigns as the cauſe why the pains ceaſed, and the mother became eaſier, a few days before delivery<note n="*" place="bottom">Stalpaart Vander Wiel, obſerv. rar. med. cent. prim. obſ. lxvi.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the examination of this caſe, I ſhall confine my remarks to the delivery of the placenta, and the appearances upon diſſection.</p>
            <p>After the child was delivered, Solin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, finding that the placenta did not eaſily follow, introduced his hand along
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0209900400:29"/>the funis, with an intention to extract it, but found himſelf in contact with the inteſtines, the placenta being, '<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra uterum,</hi>' in the cavity of the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The uterus, from which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the child to have eſcaped ſome days before, was contracted, and felt ſo hard, '<hi>ita ut initio ſcirrhum crederet.</hi>' In the next ſentence, he ſpeaks of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the placenta from the uterus: this cannot be reconciled with what he had before related, of the placenta being '<hi>extra uterum,</hi>' otherwiſe than by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the placenta, while in the abdomen, adhered to the external ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the uterus; its adheſion to the ſurface of the viſcera, in ſome other caſes, having been found to be very conſiderable<note n="*" place="bottom">Douglas's caſe of rupt. uterus, p. 36. Boneti ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchret. anatom. lib. iii. ſect. 38.</note>.</p>
            <p>A review of the circumſtances, which follow the introduction of his hand, will elucidate the caſe, when compared
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0209900400:30"/>with the appearances, which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on opening the body, after death.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place. No mention is made of any difficulty in introducing the hand through the os internum into the cavity of the uterus, which muſt have been conſiderable, from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſtate, if the attempt had been made.</p>
            <p>Secondly. As his hand came imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in contact with the inteſtines, if the placenta had been within the uterus, the inteſtines muſt likewiſe have been within it, which does not by any means appear from the narrative.</p>
            <p>And laſtly. If his hand had been within the cavity of the uterus, how could he have judged of the degree of its contraction, ſo as to have thought it, at firſt, to have been a ſcirrhus?</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0209900400:31"/>
            <p>If we conſider the caſe as a partial ſeparation of the vagina, from its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the <hi>cervix uteri,</hi> then every one of theſe objections are ſurmounted with eaſe: his hand, on paſſing along the funis, would have found an eaſy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction into the cavity of the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and he would have been in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact with the inteſtines, before his hand arrived at the placenta. The uterus would have been found on the anterior part, and have felt contracted like a ball, ſo that, at firſt, it might have been miſtaken for a ſcirrhus; neither of which could have poſſibly happened if his hand had been within its cavity: beſides, his expreſſion is ſo clear, in reſpect to its contraction, 'dure admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum compactum atque <hi>in ſe</hi> contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum comperit,' as to leave no room to ſuppoſe any thing to have been included within it.</p>
            <p>We find that on diſſection, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the external appearance of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0209900400:32"/>abdomen, and what iſſued on making an inciſion into it, he paſſed his hand, he ſays, <hi>per vulvam,</hi> and again felt the inteſtines; and, what is very material in forming a determination on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the caſe, found the uterus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding above the pubis, '<hi>recedentemque</hi> ſupra os pubis uterum reperit.' To uſe the expreſſion of Dr. Douglas, in his late, publication, <q>'it fled before the tips of his fingers.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I think it muſt be evident to every one, that the uterus would not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded before his hand, if its attachment to the vagina had remained entire. It muſt have reſiſted the touch.</p>
            <p>The place where the rupture is ſaid to have been was at the inferior and poſterior part, a little above the os in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum, where the common peritoneal membrane is continued from the rectum to the uterus.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0209900400:33"/>
            <p>Now the ſame peritoneal coat which ſurrounds the whole of the abdominal viſcera, in its paſſage from the rectum to become the external coat of the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, is inflected over that part of the vagina which is attached to the <hi>cervix uteri,</hi> beginning to form the peritoneal coat of the uterus, at the place where the vagina is joined to the cervix, a little above the os internum. In the ſame place, on the anterior part, the vagina was lacerated in the caſe before related; and, I think, on comparing the different parts of Vander Wiel's rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with each other, it is clear that the injury, in both caſes, was nearly ſimilar; the only difference being, that in one the laceration was in the poſterior, and in the other in the anterior part of the vagina.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the year 1594, a woman of Hage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naw, in Alſace, 40 years of age, who had been the mother of ſeven children, at the full time, but all of them born dead, died in labour of the eighth, on the third day, without being delivered. The night before, her pains had been violent in the extreme; the women who were preſent made many efforts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver her, but they were not able to afford her the leaſt help.</p>
            <p>On opening the body, they were very cautious in making their inciſion into the abdomen, that they might have a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0209900400:35"/>diſtinct view of the uterus <hi>in ſitu.</hi> The muſcles were hardly divided, when the back of the child was wounded. They had no ſuſpicion of what it really was, ſuppoſing it, at firſt, to be the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus; but, on continuing the inciſion, they found it to be a full formed foetus (with ſigns of putridity from the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the cuticle) without the uterus, in the cavity of the abdomen. It lay with the face to the ſacrum, and its body extended at full length. At firſt, nothing preternatural was obſerved, there being no appearance of contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wound, ulceration, or abſceſs. They wondered much at the ſingularity of the caſe; but this was cleared up when they ſound the uterus torn, rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, or rather broken off.</p>
            <p>The child was ſtill connected by the ſunis to the ſecundines, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, upon the left ſide, towards the ſpleen, and adhered ſo faſt that they had ſome difficulty to ſeparate them.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0209900400:36"/>The uterus was ſo contracted, that it did not exceed the ſize of the placenta. Near the cervix, directly under the bladder, there was a portion of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane hanging down, about the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the diſſecting knife, and not exceeding the breadth of half a palm, which was a part of the ſeparated ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>'uteri abrupti.'</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE find that the woman, who is the ſubject of this caſe, was in her 4th preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, low in ſtature, about 30 years of age, and of a weak conſtitution, but, in general, healthy. When the Doctor was firſt called to her, the membranes had been ruptured eight hours, and the pains had continued regular from that time: yet though the os tincae was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0209900400:38"/>dilated, the child did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. He found her extremely reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, complaining of exceſſive pain in the region of the pubis. Each return of pain cauſed her to writhe and twiſt as if ſuffering from violent colic, very unlike the urging throes of common la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but her pulſe was calm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, nor did ſhe make any particular complaint, excepting of the pain about the pubis. This being the ſtate of the caſe, there ſeemed to be no reaſon to induce him to precipitate the delivery.</p>
            <p>About nine o'clock the ſame evening, the midwife informed him that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient had had a diſcharge of blood from the vagina, which, however, did not continue; and that the pains had ceaſed about half an hour after ſix o'clock; ſince which, retching, with an inceſſant craving for drink, had come on.</p>
            <p>He now found her face lengthened, and bedewed with cold ſweat; her pulſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0209900400:39"/>ſcarcely to be felt; her breathing ſhort and quick, with great anxiety; but ſtill complaining of no pain, excepting about the pubis. <q>'By examination in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way,' he ſays, I could diſtinguiſh nothing, excepting a round moveable ſubſtance, which I ſuppoſed to be the head of the child; but being only able to reach it with my fingers, I could not determine with any certainty what it was. The woman appeared to be <hi>in extremis;</hi> and my mind was ſo wholly occupied by her danger, as to preclude all reaſoning with reſpect to the cauſe.'</q> He determined upon immediate delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the only chance of relief. <q>'There was no difficulty,' he ſays, 'in paſſing my hand; and the ſubſtance which I had ſuppoſed to be the child, fled before the tips of my fingers: by following it, I at laſt found my hand in a cavity, which in no ſort reſembled that of the uterus. I was then forcibly and painfully ſtruck with the nature of the caſe; and on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining all round, with caution and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0209900400:40"/>gentleneſs, I could with certainty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that my hand was in the cavity of the abdomen: the child being on the fore part; on the back part, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted uterus like an oblong ball; and the inteſtines hanging among any fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.'</q> There was no obſtruction to the turning and extraction of the child, excepting in the paſſage of the head through the brim of the pelvis. The placenta, which was likewiſe in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominal cavity, had ſo clung to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, that he was again under the neceſſity of introducing his hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach it, which was not difficult. <q>'The uterus ſeemed,' he ſays, 'to have been ruptured tranſverſely, on the lower and fore part, ſome diſtance above where the vagina is connected with it; and it was more contracted in its ſize, than I thought poſſible in the few hours which had elapſed ſince the accident.'</q>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0209900400:41"/>inflammation, the poor woman fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately recovered; and in about ſix weeks waited upon the Doctor at his own houſe, to return thanks; when he perſuaded her to permit his neighbour Dr. Oſborn to examine <hi>per vaginam.</hi> He thought the os tinae ſomewhat more open, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, than it uſually is; and Dr. Douglas himſelf fancied he felt rather more fulneſs than is common about the <hi>cervix uteri:</hi> but they both agreed, that there was nothing in the touch ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what is obſerved in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, as to have excited any idea of previous diſeaſe, had they not known the complaint with which ſhe had been afflicted.</p>
            <p>After examining the body of Mrs. Wilkins, and aſcertaining the nature of the injury, I began to conſider the above caſe in a different light, from what I did on the firſt peruſal of it. The Doctor repreſents it as a caſe of ruptured ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0209900400:42"/>I now perceive it to be a caſe of lacerated vagina.</p>
            <p>The circumſtance which he relates, of a <q>'round moveable ſubſtance,'</q> which upon introducing his hand, he found to be <q>'the contracted uterus like an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ball,'</q> was ſo ſimilar to what Mr. Waller deſcribed, and which every one of us had an opportunity of obſerving during the diſſection, that I have no doubt remaining in my own mind, that there could have been any difference between the two caſes. Mr. Waller and the other gentlemen who were preſent concur likewiſe with me in the ſame opinion.</p>
            <p>In the preceding pages, I have had occaſion, on a review of the caſe from Vander Weil, to advert to a ſimilar oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, when I expreſſed my doubts how the degree of contraction can be aſcertained, unleſs the hand of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coucheur
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0209900400:43"/>has been paſſed on the outſide of the uterus. I cannot ſuppoſe that, while the fundus is contracted above the rupture, the os internum will remain for ſeveral hours, nay days, dilated, and ſhew no diſpoſition to contract. The fibres, I ſhould apprehend, which form its texture, will aſſiſt its contraction in as great a degree as that of the fundus.</p>
            <p>Dr. Douglas, as well as Vander Weil, found that the uterus receded on intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing his hand. Is it poſſible that the uterus ſhould have receded before his hand, if its attachment had been entire? It muſt have made ſome reſiſtance. Yet we find that, when he touched it, it fled, and upon following it, his hand went, not into the uterus, but into a cavity which in no ſort reſembled it. Can it be ſuppoſed from this relation, ſo point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly marked, that his fingers ever paſſed the os internum? The uterus muſt have been fixed, if he had entered into its cavity; but he ſays, that he was obliged
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0209900400:44"/>to follow it, and at length found his hand within the abdomen, the child being on the fore part, on the back part the contracted uterus, like an oblong ball.</p>

            <p>HE was called to the aſſiſtance of a woman, who had been a conſiderable time in labour, under the care of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife; ſhe had been ſeized the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a hemorrhage, on which the child, which had before preſented with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0209900400:45"/>the head, was no longer felt. On exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, his hand entered at once into a cavity, which appeared large; on the fore part, he felt a round ſubſtance, of the ſize, but not the ſolidity, of a childs head; yet there was not any thing to be felt, which could aſſure him of a child being there. The woman died ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without being further examined. On opening the body, the child and placenta were found in the cavity of the abdomen, entirely out of the uterus, which was of the ſize of a childs head of five years old, and was the round body which had been felt <hi>per vaginam.</hi> The rupture was on the poſterior and interior part, and then about three or four inches long<note n="*" place="bottom">Poutean, page 487.</note>.</p>

Rungius relates, that the inteſtines were kept up by his hand, until the rupture was ſufficiently contracted to prevent their deſcent. Dr. Hamiiton ſays, he had an opportunity of examining how amazingly the rupture was diminiſhed, by the contraction of the uterus. La Motte obſerves, that, on diſſection, the rupture would not admit the tip of his little finger; and in other caſes we find ſimilar remarks. How are we then to account for his finding the rupture to be ſo very extenſive, at a time when the uterus was ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted?</note>,'</q> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I think that I ſhall not be too haſty in pronouncing it to have been a ſeparation of the uterus from its poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior attachment to the vagina.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0209900400:47"/>the pelvis as to be wedged, before a laceration takes place, it will remain there, and we ſhall be deprived of one criterion, the retroceſſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting part, to guide us; the ceſſation of the true pains muſt lead us then to judge of the nature of the caſe, when attended with vomiting and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as deſcribed in the relation of the preceding narratives. The following caſes is an inſtance of this kind.</p>

            <head>CASE V.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>A caſe of lacerated vagina, where the head was engaged in the pelvis, before the accident took place; communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by a friend.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>A. B. aged about 30, was taken in labour with her third child, on April 15th, 1785, at four oclock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0209900400:48"/>The waters ſoon came away. On examination, the head of the child was found to be low in the pelvis. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſtricture was obſerved in the vagina, and the ſacrum projected rather forward at its apex. About five hours after ſhe was firſt taken in labour, ſhe began to complain of pains in her belly, which ſhe diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of labour. At three oclock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, a phyſician, an eminent teacher of midwifery in London, was called in, at which time, from the degree of ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the part of the head which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented could not be exactly aſcertained. He ordered her an injection, which was given, but without any effect. On en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, it appeared, that ſince ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to complain of the pain in her belly, the labour pains had ceaſed. A ſingle blade was introduced with eaſe, and ſome endeavours made to deliver, but without ſucceſs. The Doctor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it wrong to ſtruggle againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or do any thing without the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0209900400:49"/>of pains, left her, giving directions for an enema to be injected, and four or ſix ounces of blood to be taken away.</p>
            <p>He returned at half paſt five, when very little alteration could be perceived. She had no labour pains, and the pains continued the ſame in the abdomen, which ſhe now complained was become tender. Injections were ordered, copious and ſtimulant; four were given without any return. The forceps were at length applied, and uſed moderately, with an intent to bring on a return of true pains; but a ſlight diſcharge of the glyſters was the only effect. A little ground was at length gained, and, by encreaſing the force for a conſiderable time, ſhe was delivered of a dead child: the placenta came away immediately after. She made water frequently during the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and had it drawn off before the uſe of the forceps. She was thirſty, and vomited frequently, though little in quantity. By her cries, ſhe did not ſeem
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0209900400:50"/>to ſuffer more pain, than is uſually felt in her delivery.</p>
            <p>Her pulſe were quick after ſhe was in bed; ſhe was diſpoſed to vomit, and paſſed a reſtleſs night; the pain in her belly continued diſtinct from after pain. She lived until the morning of the 18th, during which time her pulſe were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally 130 or more, her ſkin hot, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of great pain and tenderneſs of the abdomen; ſhe vomited frequently, and her urgings to vomit were great.</p>
            <p>From no local injury being ſuppoſed to have happened, and from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the lochia, and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, the caſe was conſidered as truly puerperal, and treated as ſuch.</p>
            <p>On diſſection, the inteſtines were found to be inflamed, with an exudation of lymph on their ſurfaces, and the gall bladder was large and diſtended with bile. The uterus was contracted to the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0209900400:51"/>ſize of double fiſt, black, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſphacelate. The vagina was found to be lacerated at its connexion to the <hi>cervix uteri,</hi> anteriorly, no veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige of the ſtricture remaining<note place="bottom">Although, in the caſe which gave riſe to theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, the bladder was unfortunately injured, yet it does not follow, that this muſt neceſſarily happen always; for in this caſe we ſee, that a laceration may take place on the anterior part, without its being injured; and from other caſes we are taught, that the poſterior or lateral parts are as often liable to the accident, as the anterior part of the vagina.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved, that the woman had fallen down, a day or two before ſhe was taken in labour, and that the ſame gentleman had delivered her, two years before, with forceps, on account of the ſame ſtricture.</p>
            <p>How far the ſixth caſe quoted by Dr. Douglas might be ſimilar to the above, I have ſome doubts; but the circumſtances attending it render it probable.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0209900400:52"/>
            <p>It appears, that the woman had been in labour the beſt part of the day, with very ſtrong pains, before the rupture is ſuppoſed to have taken place. The head was firmly wedged in the pelvis; but, in attempting to open it, ſuddenly gave way to the force applied.</p>
            <p>Now, let us conſider for one moment the nature of the caſe. If a rupture had taken place in the uterus, as the head was firmly wedged in the pelvis, the feet muſt have been the part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded; whence, when I recollect the ſtrong contractile power of the uterus<note n="*" place="bottom">When a part of the child only has eſcaped through a rupture of the uterus, the contraction, as related by authors, is great. Hildanus gives a caſe where the head of a child had paſſed through a rupture of the uterus, which had contracted ſo ſtrongly round its neck, that, he ſays, it had no doubt been ſtrangled by it.
<p>Hildani Centur. i. obſerv. 54.</p>
               </note>, and the length of time intervening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the attempt to open the head, and the time when the rupture is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0209900400:53"/>to have happened, I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf that the child would have eſcaped ſo eaſy into the cavity of the abdomen as he found it did.</p>
            <p>If the vagina was lacerated, it is eaſy to account for the ſudden retroceſſion of the child. It is evident, that the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus being only attached in one place, its reſiſtance againſt the preſſure could only be partial; the fundus would be inclined, and the os internum raiſed in proportion; therefore, when the head was preſſed back, it would find an eaſy admittance, through the laceration, into the cavity of the abdomen; from the endeavours of the uterus to free itſelf, the body with the placenta would ſoon follow. The rupture being near the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vix is, I think, ſome ſupport to what I have advanced. I ſhall likewiſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew, in another place, that the placenta being in the cavity of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, may be conſidered as a collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proof.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0209900400:54"/>
            <p>I AM inclined to believe, that the whole of the child very ſeldom eſcapes from a rupture of the uterus. I am, however, very well convinced, that it is always the conſequence of a laceration of the vagina, unleſs it ſhould happen to be as firmly wedged in the pelvis as in the caſes I have juſt noticed.</p>
            <p>On a review of fifteen caſes quoted by Dr. Douglas, we ſhall find, that the child eſcaped into the cavity of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen in ſeven; in No. VI. VII. X. XI. XII. XIII. and XIV. I have already endeavoured to ſhew that No. VI. and XI. were lacerations of the vagina, and I ſhall draw ſome inferences from No. XII. when I come to ſpeak of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa being out of the uterus, tending to ſhow a degree of probability of that being of the ſame nature. Of No. VII.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0209900400:55"/>we have a very uncertain account, as, from motives of delicacy, it is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly entered into. No. X. without doubt, muſt have been a ruptured ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus. I think that the two laſt cannot be conſidered in point, as they were at an early period of geſtation, and the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents happened from external violence.</p>
            <p>In the remaining eight, No. I. II. III. IV. V. VIII. IX. and XV. only part of the child had eſcaped from the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; indeed, in the two firſt, it does not appear that any part had eſcaped. It is therefore evident that, ſetting aſide the two caſes from external violence, in only one out of thirteen the child eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped wholly from a rupture of the uterus.</p>
            <p>I am alſo inclined to believe, that the placenta being in the cavity of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, is an occurrence which very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens, excepting in thoſe caſes where the vagina is lacerated. The
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0209900400:56"/>ſize of the rupture, when it happens in the uterus, muſt be diminiſhed almoſt immediately after the child has eſcaped, and the contraction of the uterus muſt be encreaſed by its endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the placenta; it is therefore almoſt impoſſible that the placenta ſhould eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape into the abdomen: it might indeed ſometimes happen, if the funis ſhould be much twiſted round the child's neck or body. In almoſt every caſe, where we have a certainty that the accident was a rupture of the uterus, we find that the placenta remained behind.</p>
            <p>When a laceration takes place in the vagina, the propulſion of the placenta is not different from what happens in common parturition; as every contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the uterus forces it towards the os internum, from whence it paſſes after the child into the cavity of the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But when there is a rupture in the uterus, every contraction muſt be an impediment to its propulſion, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0209900400:57"/>the ſize of the aperture, thro' which it muſt paſs, to be found among the viſcera.</p>
            <p>In the caſe of Mrs. Wilkins, where we can entertain no doubt of the nature of the accident, the placenta was found with the child in the cavity of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen. In that of Mrs. Manning, in thoſe from Vander Weil, Bonetus, and Pouteau, and in the ſixth caſe quoted by Dr. Douglas, all of which I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhew were of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the placenta was likewiſe found among the viſcera.</p>
            <p>There are two more inſtances, among the caſes quoted by Dr. Douglas, where the ſame occurrence is ſaid to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; in No. X. and XII.</p>
            <p>The firſt, communicated by Dr. Garth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, is againſt the opinion I have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that being, as I have before obſerved, evidently a rupture of the uterus. In the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0209900400:58"/>other, from Saviard, it appears, that the child preſented favourably, with every appearance that the labour would be ſoon finiſhed; yet the pains ceaſed at once, after two days continuance; the preſenting part receded, and only the placenta was to be felt. She died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivered; and when the body was opened, the child and ſecundines were in the abdomen among the viſcera, the feet of the child touching the ſtomach of the mother. The inteſtines were all fretted, and the omentum rotten and ſtinking, but the uterus was of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural appearance. I have not Saviard's book to refer to; but I think, from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of this account, I ſhall be able to draw ſome inferences in my favour.</p>
            <p>From the manner in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf, that the uterus was of its natural appearance, we may be led to ſuppoſe that no injury had happened to it. When we recollect the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that, after the preſenting part
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0209900400:59"/>had receded, the placenta alone was to be felt, I apprehend but a ſmall degree of doubt concerning the nature of the caſe will remain.</p>
            <p>After the body was opened, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundines as well as the child were found in the abdomen. As the placenta was to be felt on examination, after the rupture had taken place, how can it be ſuppoſed that the rupture was in the uterus? The uterus muſt have been at that time conſiderably contracted, and the aperture ſo much diminiſhed, as to have rendered the eſcape of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Hence I am clearly of opinion, that the placenta being felt on examination, after the rupture had taken place, and being afterwards found in the abdomen, is a great proof that the accident was not in the uterus, but in the vagina.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0209900400:60"/>
            <p>Out of eight caſes, therefore, where the placenta was found with the child in the cavity of the abdomen, there is the greateſt probability to ſuppoſe that ſeven of them were lacerations of the vagina.</p>
            <p>THE difficulty attending delivery, when the vagina is lacerated, muſt be very trifling, when compared to that which will occur if the accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the uterus. In the caſe of Mrs. Wilkins, the only reſiſtance was in bringing down the breech, which all the gentlemen preſent agreed aroſe from the protuberance of the child's belly projecting over the fundus of the contracted uterus; which, as the extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion went on, was brought lower down, and, of conſequence, preſſed the breech of the child over the pubis: after this was overcome, not the leaſt difficulty
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0209900400:61"/>whatever occurred. In the caſe of Mrs. Manning, it does not appear that there was any reſiſtance to the delivery of the breech; but we find there was a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable obſtruction in the paſſage of the head through the pelvis. I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inclined to believe that this might have ariſen from the ſame cauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Dr. Douglas ſuppoſes it to have proceeded from the narrowneſs of the pelvis.</p>
            <p>In thoſe caſes, where the uterus has been ruptured, the difficulty will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or diminiſhed, in proportion as more or leſs of the child has eſcaped into the cavity of the abdomen.</p>
            <p>If the rupture ſhould be ſo extenſive as to admit the child to eſcape entirely out of the uterus, from the natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of its fibres, the uterus will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt immediately contract, and the ſize of the rupture will become leſs, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in proportion to the degree
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0209900400:62"/>of contraction which takes place. If the rupture ſhould be ſo ſmall as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the protruſion of part of the child only, a ſtricture will be formed upon ſuch part as has eſcaped, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a conſiderable degree of force to overcome, as, from its endeavours to expel the part which remains, the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus will ſtill continue to contract. In performing the caeſarean operation, M. Soumain found that the edges of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion made in the uterus preſſed ſo cloſe upon the foetus, that he could hardly get his fingers in to extract it<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem. de l'Acad. Chirurg. Paris, mem. xx.</note>. Hence we may account for the alternate though ineffectual pains, which, in ſome caſes, have been obſerved to continue for ſome time after the rupture has taken place; and I believe we may be led to form a probable opinion that, when this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, ſome part of the child ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains within the uterus.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0209900400:63"/>
            <p>The hand of the accoucheur, when he ſits down to deliver, muſt be paſſed through the os internum into the cavity of the uterus, and from thence through the rupture. The difficulty attending the paſſage of the hand will be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the degree of contraction; but, unfortunately, it is very ſeldom that the nature of the caſe is known ſo early, as to induce us to make any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to deliver before the uterus is conſiderably contracted. After the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from the diminiſhed ſtate of the rupture is overcome, and the hand paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the abdomen, the feet, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, may be ſoon found, and brought down with ſome eaſe; but as the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator proceeds, and the legs come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, every inch of the child, as the extraction takes place, will create a freſh reſiſtance from its increaſing bulk. The irritation which muſt be given to the uterus, by the introduction of the hand, will increaſe its endeavours to contract, and make conſiderable addition to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0209900400:64"/>difficulty. Caldani, of Bologna, in a letter to Haller, relates ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made on the uterus of a bitch, which ſhow the great degree of contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that takes place even after death, on any ſtimulus being applied to it<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Van Swieten's comment. ſect. 1316.</note>.</p>
            <p>The nearer likewiſe the rupture hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the fundus or cervis, the greater degree of eaſe or difficulty will enſue. In the firſt inſtance, the extraction will be made nearly in a direct line. In the other, and which moſt commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that part of the child which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the abdomen muſt form an angle with the feet and legs, while they are paſſing through the vagina, and the degrees of ſuch angle will be decreaſed or increaſed, in proportion as the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may happen to be, either near the cervix, or further towards the fundus.</p>
            <p>Very little more exertion will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired than what is obliged to be made
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0209900400:65"/>uſe of in a common caſe, where the child is turned, when the feet are the only parts that have eſcaped. When the legs have protruded as far as the knee, the reſiſtance will be conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more powerful; as, in ſuch caſe, the hand muſt be paſſed to a greater diſtance through the rupture in ſearch of the feet: but how much more muſt the difficulty be increaſed, if the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be large enough to admit the child to paſs out of the uterus as far as the hips? Indeed I apprehend this ſituation to be worſe than when the whole of the child has eſcaped; as, in that caſe, there may be ſome hope that the reſiſtance might be overcome, and the child extracted by the feet; but when the child has eſcaped as far as the hips, ſuch a very conſiderable diſtenſion, if not further laceration of the rupture, muſt take place, and ſo great a degree of force muſt be made uſe of to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the contraction, in order to gain ſufficient room to bring the feet back, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0209900400:66"/>leave little room to hope for ſucceſs. In fact, when I reflect on the very great difficulties that muſt ariſe when any conſiderable part of the child has eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, I do not at all wonder that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have concurred in pronouncing the accident mortal, and giving no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for attempting relief, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by having recourſe to the caeſarean operation.</p>
            <p>In addition to Mrs. Manning's caſe, of which we have had occaſion to ſpeak ſo often, eight others are adduced by Dr. Douglas, to evince the eaſe with which delivery may be performed in caſes of ruptured uterus. No. I. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. and XV. On read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them over with attention, I have obſerved that the ſituation of the child, in moſt of them, was ſuch as to create the ſmaller degree of reſiſtance, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opinion I have entertained in reſpect to the difficulty attending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0209900400:67"/>
            <p>In the firſt, which was related to Heiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Rungius, it does not appear that the child, or any part of it, had ever been in the cavity of the abdomen. Indeed Dr. Douglas is of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion himſelf, as he ſays, <q>'the recovery of the patients, No. I. and II. may have been in a great meaſure owing to the viſcera having ſuſtained little or no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, as there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that the child in either caſe had been in the cavity of the abdomen<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Obſervat. on extr. caſe of rupt. uter. p. 66.</note>.'</q> This may give us ſome idea of the proſpect we have of recovery when a rupture takes place, but cannot be brought to ſhow the eaſe with which delivery may be performed, when the whole or part of the child has eſcaped from the uterus.</p>
            <p>In No. IV. which is taken from La Motte, <hi>obſervation</hi> 317, the feet were the only parts out of the uterus, and the rupture was at the fundus; whence
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0209900400:68"/>the extraction was not attended with much difficulty, for two reaſons: the endeavours made uſe of were in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line, in the firſt inſtance, and in the ſecond, the feet being the only parts that had eſcaped, the hand of the accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheur was introduced until it came to the knees, ſo as to bring them down and diſengage the feet; after which, no more difficulty would ariſe than what happens in a common caſe of turning.</p>
            <p>In No. V. likewiſe from La Motte, <hi>obſervation</hi> 318, it appears that the child had eſcaped out of the uterus as far as the hips, or even further, part of the body being in the cavity of the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The child was turned, he ſays, and extracted with conſiderable eaſe; <hi>en moins d'un miſerere,</hi> as he expreſſes it himſelf. I cannot think, with Dr. Douglas, that La Motte's obſervations are related with ſuch plainneſs and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, as to claim our moſt perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. In this inſtance, we have a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0209900400:69"/>caſe the moſt difficult that can poſſibly happen, and yet the delivery was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with the greateſt eaſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. I really am of opinion, that the relation is not founded in fact: I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that he has either magnified the proportion of the child which was out of the uterus, or that he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the difficulty he muſt have met with, in caſe ſuch a conſiderable part of the child had been in the abdomen.</p>
            <p>I have advanced ſome reaſons, in a former part of theſe obſervations, when ſpeaking of the head of the child being wedged in the pelvis, at the time when a laceration happens, tending to ſhow that No. VI. was a laceration of the vagina.</p>
            <p>We have a very defective account of No. VII. as from motives of delicacy to the gentleman who attended the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, Dr. Douglas does not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at liberty to enter more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into it.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0209900400:70"/>
            <p>In No. VIII. from Peu, the time elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between the accident and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is not related; but I am inclined to believe that it was done very ſoon after, from the apparent facility with which it was accompliſhed. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears likewiſe ſome deficiency in the contractile power of the uterus, by the exceſſive hemorrhage that followed. We find however that he <q>'delivered with great caution to avoid doing further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the uterus.'</q> This ſeems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſome degree of reſiſtance, altho' none is mentioned.</p>
            <p>Dr. Douglas obſerves, that the great contractile power of the uterus is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the proceſs of healing, by bringing the divided parts more into contact; <q>'but,' he ſays, 'the preſence of any conſiderable extraneous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, even in the abdomen, ſeems, in ſome degree to counteract this power of contraction<note n="*" place="bottom">Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0209900400:71"/>of its contents, does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract as in common parturition, we muſt expect a conſiderable flooding. In the above caſe, we are told that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive. In the caſes of Mrs. Wilkins, and the others which I have related as lacerations of the vagina, the hemorrhage was not very great<note n="*" place="bottom">That a conſiderable hemorrhage will follow, however, from a laceration of the vagina, as well as from a rupture of the uterus, we have the authority of Veſlingius. 'Bis enim notavi, cum uteri vagina, ſecundum latus dextrum eſſet diſrupta, quamvis foetus extinctus integre cum ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis educeretur; ſubſequente ex laceratis hypogaſtricis vaſis enormi ſanguinis profluvio, matrem paulo poſt fato pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ceſſiſſe.'—J. Veſlingii obſerv. et epiſt. 45.</note>, and the uterus was found contracted to the uſual ſize it would have been, in the ſame ſpace of time, if no extraneous body had been in the cavity of the abdomen.</p>
            <p>In No. IX. from Steidele, it appears that the head had eſcaped from the rupture, he brought down the feet with eaſe, but found ſome difficulty in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0209900400:72"/>the reſt of the foetus. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faculty muſt evidently have ariſen from the ſtricture formed by the edges of the rupture round the child's neck; whence I think it cannot be conſidered as much ſupport, to evince the eaſe with which delivery is performed, any more than the laſt caſe, where the patient expired while the accoucheur was endeavouring to bring the head through the pelvis.</p>
            <p>LACERATIONS of the vagina, I have before obſerved, have been taken notice of by authors, yet it does not appear that they have had any idea of the child's eſcaping by ſuch means into the cavity of the abdomen. If the caſe which gave riſe to theſe obſervations, in which the nature of the accident could not be miſtaken, and my reaſoning on the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent caſes I have adduced, are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0209900400:73"/>to have any weight, I think I may venture to draw the following conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the whole of the child eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes, into the cavity of the abdomen, much oftener from a laceration of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina than from a rupture of the uterus.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That, from the little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty with which delivery is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in lacerations of the vagina, there is a greater proſpect of recovery in ſuch accidents, than when the uterus is the ſeat of the injury.</p>
            <p>It is evident that the gloomy idea of inevitable death has not only been the means of checking ſuch endeavours as might have been ſometimes ſucceſsful, but that it has likewiſe been often the means of preventing us from knowing the real nature of the injury. I hope practitioners in future will, from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate event of the caſe of Mrs. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0209900400:74"/>related by Dr. Douglas, and the new light thrown on the ſubject by the caſe I have related of Mrs. Wilkins, entertain a more favourable opinion of the ſucceſs likely to attend their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, in a ſituation where nothing but immediate delivery can afford the leaſt proſpect of recovery.</p>
            <p>When firſt I made my private remarks on Mrs. Wilkins's caſe, I did not intend to enter further into the ſubject, than to draw the caſe up ſair, and ſend it to ſome periodical publication, as worthy the attention of the medical world. But the ſimilarity between it and that of Mrs. Manning was ſo ſtriking, that the more I conſidered it, the more reaſons I ſaw to induce me to publiſh it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent form.</p>
            <p>The nature of the ſubjct has obliged me to enter very fully into the merits of Dr. Douglas's caſe. That he ſhould be liable to cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in forming an opinion
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0209900400:75"/>on the nature of the accident, is not to be wondered at, when we conſider how ſilent authors have been upon it, and how ſeldom accidents of this nature oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur. I have not the honour of being known to him; but I am confident, from the liberality of his ſentiments as a gentleman, that he will not conſider the liberty I have taken as perſonal, or in any other light than as a diſcharge of the duty every man in the profeſſion owes to the world. It has a claim upon us to elucidate any occult part of the ſcience, and every man is bound by the laws of humanity to comply with it, whenever an opportunity offers.
