            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF HOGARTH.</head>
                  <byline>BY MR. HARRISON.</byline>
                  <p>THAT truly original genius, the celebrated WILLIAM HOGARTH, was born in London, in 1697. After re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a tolerable education, he was apprenticed to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graver of arms and cyphers on plate, uſually called a ſilver engraver; but the powerful impulſe of genius directed his ſtudies to painting.</p>
                  <p>Much of his early life was paſt in obſcurity. He chiefly employed his talents, in deſigning and engraving for the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers; who were then much worſe patrons of the arts than they have ſince proved. He alſo painted family pictures and portraits; in all which performances he evinced more ability, than he acquired reward.</p>
                  <p>But his originality, in the mean time, was maturing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. He purſued Nature through her infinity; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated her not through the opticks of imitation, but with his own ſedulous and critical eye. Whenever he beheld a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable countenance, or witneſſed any ſtriking occurrence, he was accuſtomed, by the immediate uſe of his pencil, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it's remembrance.</p>
                  <p>In 1730, he married the only daughter of Sir James Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill. This union was, indeed, a ſtolen one. But the growing reputation of Hogarth at length effected a reconciliation with his father-in-law; and his Harlot's Progreſs, publiſhed in 1731, announced to the publick the rich acquiſition of a Comick Painter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0906500201:6"/>His merit now became conſpicuous; and his pencil acquired, at every exertion, additional reputation. His Marriage A-la-mode, produced in 1745, gave riſe to the celebrated comedy of the Clandeſtine Marriage.</p>
                  <p>In 1753, he wrote his Analyſis of Beauty. In this work, he proves, by a variety of examples, that "a curve is the line of beauty, and that round ſwelling figures are moſt pleaſing to the eye." An opinion which has been confirmed by ſubſequent writers.</p>
                  <p>The cloſe of his life was embittered by a ſatirical conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Churchill, and Mr. Wilkes. Hogarth caricatured Churchill, and Churchill ſampooned Hogarth. "Never," ſays Lord Orford, "did two angry men, of their abilities, throw mud with leſs dexterity."</p>
                  <p>He was now viſibly declining in health; and died, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 25, 1764.</p>
                  <p>This great artiſt has the glory of forming a ſchool; and the maſter remains unrivalled by his ſcholars. He paints to the underſtanding, and the heart; and his pictures may ſerve as annals of the manners of the age. He is, in Painting, what Fielding is in Romance, or Moliere in Comedy.</p>
                  <p>Hogarth was buried at Chiſwick; and the following Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph, written by his friend Garrick, is engraved on a neat pyramidical monument—
<q>
                        <l>"Farewel, great Painter of Mankind,</l>
                        <l>Who reach'd the nobleſt point of Art;</l>

                        <l>And through the Eye correct the Heart.</l>
                        <l>If Genius fire thee, Reader, ſtay;</l>
                        <l>If Nature touch thee, drop a tear:</l>
                        <l>If neither move thee, turn away,</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Memorial on which theſe elegant lines are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed ſhall have long been crumbled into duſt, the Works of Hogarth will be admired, if the love of merit then exiſts in the world.</p>

                  <p>This intereſting hiſtory, to uſe the language of the drama, opens with a ſcene, which preſents to the ſpectator our two heroes, the fellow-apprentices, ſeated in the looms of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, a reſpectable ſilk-manufacturer of Spitalfields. One of them, who is depicted with an ingenuous and pleaſing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, appears diligently and attentively employed in weaving; while the other, whoſe features expreſs an abject groveling mind, while his dreſs denotes neligence and ſloth, ſits faſt aſleep, in a ſeeming ſtate of intoxication. This idea is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the tankard and tobacco-pipe: and his ruling paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are farther developed, by the ballad of <hi>"Moll Flanders,"</hi> &amp;c. on the wall; by the torn pamphlet of <hi>"The Prentices Guide;"</hi> and by the kitten's apparently familiar acquaintance with the unemployed ſhuttle, which has dropped from his hand, and ſerves the animal for a plaything. The Maſter, who is ſeen entering, expreſſes an inclination to correct the idle apprentice with his uplifted cane; but ſeems reſtrained by reflecting on the little good to be expected from any chaſtiſement of a lad in whom vicious habits are ſo deeply rooted. The diſpoſition of the good youth is contraſted with that of his fellow-apprentice, by the choice of thoſe excellent old ballads, <hi>"Turn again, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,"</hi> and <hi>"The Valiant 'Prentice;"</hi> as well as by the clean and perfect ſtate in which he has preſerved his copy of <hi>"The 'Prentices Guide."</hi>

                  <p>LAUGHING is that noble faculty which diſtinguiſhes man from beaſt, ſince it ſhews the rationality of the ſoul, which can be moved independent of the ſenſes. It is the mark of reaſon, the badge of good-humour, and the ſign of mirth. Shakſpeare ſays—

                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſaid of the Roman Caſſius, that—
<q>
                        <l>"He ſeldom ſmil'd; or ſmil'd in ſuch a ſort,</l>
                        <l>As if he ſcorn'd himſelf, that could be mov'd</l>
                        <l>To ſmile at any thing."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this fellow Caſſius always lived a melancholy life, and at laſt died a murderer; but the man who lives laughing, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally dies in his bed, as an honeſt man ought.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to laughing, we ſhould conſider three things: firſt, who laughs; ſecondly, who is laughed at; and, thirdly, what the laughing is about.</p>
                  <p>When a man tells a merry tale, he ſhould laugh inwardly, and enjoy the joke in his mind more than in his countenance; for he who laughs aloud at his own joke is in the court of Comus conſidered as a ſool.</p>
                  <p>When a merry ſtory is ended, you may be allowed to make a little noiſe in laughing, as it ſhews your approbation of what was meant for your entertainment; but never break into the middle of a ſtory by loud laughter, ſuch interruptions being very diſagreeable to the company, as well as to the ſpeaker; and all the merry ammunition ſhould be preſerved for the concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Laughing not only increaſes the good-humour of ſociety, and promotes ſocial enjoyment, but it is of infinite ſervice to the health, and has ſometimes ſaved the lives of ſick perſons.</p>
                  <p>The famous Doctor Radcliffe was once ſent for into the country by a gentleman who was dangerouſly ill of a quinſey; and ſoon perceiving that no application would be of ſervice, he deſired the cook to make a large haſty-pudding, and let his ſervant bring it up. While the cook was engaged in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, he took his man aſide, and inſtructed him. The man accordingly brought up the pudding in great order, and ſet it on the table in full view of the patient. "Come, John," ſaid the doctor, "you love haſty-pudding; eat ſome with me, for I believe you came out without your breakfaſt." Both then fell to with their ſpoons; but John's going twice to his mouth to his maſter's once, the doctor took occaſion to quarrel with him, by dabbing a ſpoonful of hot pudding in his face. John threw another at his maſter; who, apparently in a violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, quitted his ſpoon, took the haſty-pudding up by handfuls, and threw it at his man, who battled him again in the ſame
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0906500201:9"/>manner, till they were both all over in a woeful pickle. The gentleman, having a full view of this comical combat, was ſo delighted at it, that he burſt into a moſt immoderate fit of laughter, which broke the quinſey, and compleatly cured him.</p>
                  <p>"Laugh, and be fat," is a common ſaying; therefore I would recommend laughing to the conſumptive, ill-conditioned, and ſplenetick, as the certain cure of their diſorders. When we are laughed at, we ſhould never be angry, as that ſerves only to increaſe the laughter of thoſe who jeer us. The only way is, to retort jeſt for jeſt, and joke for joke: and, when a ſtory is told to expoſe any of our follies, we ſhould not only take the hint to amend them, but endeavour, at the ſame time, to expoſe, by an appoſite ſtory, ſome folly peculiar to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who attempted to expoſe us, that he may likewiſe come in for his ſhare of improvement. Thus laughing will be of mutual benefit, and good-humour and inſtruction go hand in hand. Beſides, a retort has great force: ſince it not only takes away the ſting of a former jeſt, but eſtabliſhes our reputation for a ready turn of wit.</p>
                  <p>Thus, when the pay of a certain regiment in France had been kept back for a long time, and one of the officers being greatly preſſed for money, and much diſcontented, went to the colonel, ſaying—"Three words with you, Sir—money or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge." The latter immediately replied—"Four with you, Sir—neither one nor t'other."</p>
                  <p>But as we may not always be able to parry the ſarcaſms of wit with ſucceſs, we ſhould endeavour to gain ſuch an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy over our paſſions, as to be always in a good humour with ourſelves. The tranquillity of our own minds will prove the beſt deſence againſt the worſt attacks.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude theſe remarks with a ſhort ſtory, which every reader may apply as he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>When gods and goddeſſes made frequent viſits to mankind, a beautiful and young roving divinity went into a nation of hunch-back people. On entering the capital, he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a multitude of the inhabitants, who derided him moſt unmercifully for having what they deemed ſo odious a form; and would have proceeded to ſtill greater violence, had not one, wiſer than the reſt, ſuddenly cried out—"My friends and countrymen, conſider well what you are doing! Let us not inſult this unhappy piece of deformi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y. If Heaven has laviſhed on us all the gifts of beauty; if it has adorned our backs with a noble mountain of fleſh; let us be filled with gratitude, repair to our temples, and return thanks to the immortal Gods!" This is the hiſtory of human vanity; for, to ſucceed in any country, we muſt carry the hunch of the nation into which we travel.</p>

                  <head>PLEASURES OF BEING IN DEBT.</head>
                  <byline>BY ARTHUR MURPHY, ESQ.</byline>
                  <p>I Hope you will not refuſe place to a correſpondent, who means to ſhew the futility of a maxim, which has gained credit with moſt people, though extremely ill-grounded, as I think I can fairly evince, from an experimental knowledge of mankind.</p>
                  <p>You undoubtedly recollect that Ovid has, in one of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, the following lines—
<q>
                        <l>"Donec eris felix multos numerabis Amicos;</l>
                        <l>Tempora ſi fuerint nubila, folus eris."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, it is ſo far from being true, that a man is ſurrounded with friends in proſperity, and is left deſtitute under his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, that I will undertake to prove the very reverſe: in doing this, I flatter myſelf, I ſhall ſerve the purpoſes of virtue, and vindicate the dignity of human nature.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know, then, that I came to this town, a few years ſince, with intent to read the law, having juſt fortune enough to ſupport me in my ſtudies, until I might fix myſelf in a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable road of buſineſs. For this purpoſe I lodged in one of the Inns of Court; and the oeconomy which I was obliged to obſerve rendering it impoſſible for me to go much into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I ſoon found out that I led a very muzzy ſort of a life. I therefore ſhifted the ſcene; and, though in a ſhort time, I found means to run out my little fortune, I cannot ſay that I was relinquiſhed by the world on this account. It is true that ſome of my acquaintance totally deſerted me; but it was the occaſion, at the ſame time, that others were more earneſtly attached than they would otherwiſe have been. I remember the laſt word my aunt in the country ſaid to me, was—"Bob, wherever you go, be ſure to make friends for yourſelf." This advice, I will venture to ſay, I have had the addreſs to conform to, with great ſucceſs, as will appear from the ſequel.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the friendſhips of the world are leagues in debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and intemperance, made in the drawing of a cork, and often ended in the ſame manner. <hi>"Out of ſight out of mind,"</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, with regard to the generality of connections: but the impreſſions I have made on the minds of my friends are not ſo eaſily effaced; on the contrary, when it happens that I am ſeldom ſeen by them, they are known to be in very great ſolicitude about me, are conſtantly very earneſt in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after me, and the diſcourſe they uſually have with each other is—"Have you ſeen our old friend lately? I can't think what's become of him; I hope he is not gone out of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0906500201:11"/>town—I have not ſeen him for a long time—Faith, I am very uneaſy about him—I wiſh to God he would ſee and ſettle his affairs—He's a very careleſs young fellow—a great deal too wild—throws away his money like dirt—I have called upon him morning after morning, but all to no purpoſe—I'd give a bottle of wine I could meet with him—I'd rather that than my dinner—I never longed ſo much to ſee any body."</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the general expreſſions of anxiety, which my friends expreſs on my account; and there are ſome of them who are not content to reſt here—words coſt nothing; they carry the thing to ſuch a length as to employ a couple of fellows, who are daily in all quarters of the town, hunting and prying about for me. As there are few inſtances of ſuch earneſt friendſhip in the world, I am ſenſible what I have ſaid may have a romantick appearance; and the reader may ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to himſelf, that I am entertaining him all this while with a novel; but, I muſt take leave to aſſure you that every word is literally true; and, what may perhaps raiſe your idea ſtill higher, not one of all theſe people has ever got a ſhilling by me; and, I verily believe, few of them ever will. Having ſaid thus much in the praiſe of theſe my well-wiſhers, it will naturally be deſired of me, to inform the world who and what they are, who are in ſuch concern about a ſtranger. Not to keep you any longer in ſuſpence, I will now tell you, that I have experienced all this generoſity from my Creditors.</p>
                  <p>By this it will appear that the pleaſure of being in debt, though very common in life, is very little underſtood by the generality of thoſe who addict themſelves to this gratification. The art, in all theſe caſes, is to refine upon the occurrences and diſappointments to which our ſtate is liable; and, for my part, the pleaſure juſt mentioned is one of the moſt valuable enjoyments of my life. My morning levee is as great as any nobleman's; whereas, in the days that I could ſay I was in poſſeſſion of a competence, I never had any viſitor whatever, except a laundreſs to make my bed in the Temple. But now the caſe is perfectly altered: there is a conſtant crowd of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants about my doors; and, to thoſe that are admitted, I have the pleaſure of making as many promiſes as a miniſter of ſtate, beſides a loſty pride in keeping them much after the ſame faſhion. Upon theſe occaſions, it will now and then happen, that they who beſt know how to make their court, and have the art of taking a pliant hour, ſometimes prevail upon me to appoint a day for the completion of their wiſhes. As things of conſequence cannot be done in a violent hurry, the day agreed upon is generally very diſtant, may be from ſix to nine or twelve months; during which ſpace of time, it is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0906500201:12"/>that their good-nature never ſuffers the leaſt abatement, but they remain as ſolicitous as ever, frequently expreſſing the moſt tender regard for my welfare. "My dear Sir, do take a little care of yourſelf—It goes to my very heart to hear you cough ſo hard—Why, you'll not live three months at this rate—Be adviſed by me, and put a ſtocking about your neck to-night, and take ſomething to ſweat you a little and eaſe your cheſt. You ſhould not drink ſo much—Conſider, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs both conſtitution and purſe—You know it's for your good I ſpeak—You'd be a great loſs to your friends—Take up a little: fleſh and blood can't hold it always."</p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, am I beloved; and that for no other reaſon, but my addreſs in making friends for myſelf: and I am ſo cloſely watched by theſe generous creatures, that it is totally out of my power to take any wrong ſtep, that might be detrimental to my affairs. Of this I had a convincing proof about a year ago, when the interpoſition of my taylor hindered me from committing a very inconſiderate action. I was going with a friend to take a trip to Paris, by which expedient I muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been drained of all my ready-money; but the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance of my friend contrived to have me ſtopped as I was juſt ſtepping into the poſt-chaiſe, and I was thence conducted to a generous bailiff's houſe in Gray's Inn Lane, for the ſum of three hundred pounds. Here I remained confined till my paſſion for travel was perfectly cooled; and when I was at length reſtored to my liberty, my above-mentioned friends, took particular care not to leave me a ſingle ſhilling, for fear I ſhould have the ſame unhappy turn a ſecond time.</p>
                  <p>While I thus enjoy the aſſiduity and benevolence of ſuch a number, who are kind enough to intereſt themſelves in my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, I muſt own there is a ſpecies of Creditors who are an exception to the general rule; for though all thoſe of whom I have hitherto been ſpeaking, are upon every occaſion highly pleaſed to meet me, this laſt claſs deteſt the very ſight of me. As I am not conſcious that I have ever done any thing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur their diſpleaſure to ſo great a degree, their averſion ſhocks me the more; and, notwithſtanding all the pains I have taken to ſoften them by politeneſs, they ſtill remain inexorable. Whenever I do not pay them what is due to them, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put them off with the handſomeſt apology in my power: but it is all to no purpoſe; I have run too far in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, and they are not by any means to be ſatisfied. As I ſhould be glad if you would give them a word of advice, I will juſt hint to you that the perfonages whom I mean are no other than Gentlemen's Servants. The cry among them all is— "What can a poor ſerving-man do, if he is robbed of his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0906500201:13"/>vales by ſuch ſcoundrels?" They are all very unwilling to let me run farther in their debt; and therefore it is, I can hardly get any thing out of their hands. If I call for beer at table, they are ſure not to hear me till their maſter orders them to ſerve the gentleman; then I receive the leavings of the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard juſt out of the hands of the moſt capacious ſwallow in the company. In ſhort, the peeviſhneſs of theſe my Creditors is a great diſcount upon my happineſs; and, I muſt confeſs, there is no kind of pleaſure in being in debt to them. However, I muſt endeavour to bear this inconvenience; and, if you will be pleaſed to inſert this letter, I ſhall be proud to get into your books; and ſhall have the farther pleaſure of being indebted to you for this act of civility, which will always oblige me to be your moſt obedient ſervant, and ſincere well-wiſher,</p>

                  <head>DIRECTIONS FOR SERVANTS.</head>
                  <byline>BY DEAN SWIFT.</byline>
                  <p>WHEN your maſter or lady calls a ſervant by name, if that ſervant be not in the way, none of you are to anſwer, for then there will be no end of your drudgery: and maſters themſelves allow, that if a ſervant comes when he is called it is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>When you have done a fault, be always pert and inſolent, and behave yourſelf as if you were the injured perſon; this will immediately put your maſter or lady off their mettle.</p>
                  <p>If you ſee your maſter wronged by any of your fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, be ſure to conceal it, for fear of being called a tell-tale: however, there is one exception in caſe of a favourite ſervant, who is juſtly hated by the whole family; who therefore are bound in prudence to lay all the faults they can upon the favourite.</p>
                  <p>The cook, the butler, the groom, the market-man, and every other ſervant who is concerned in the expences of the family, ſhould act as if the whole of his maſter's eſtate ought to be applied to that ſervant's particular buſineſs. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if the cook computes his maſter's eſtate to be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year, he reaſonably concludes, that a thouſand pounds a year will afford meat enough, and therefore he need not be ſparing; the butler makes the ſame judgment, ſo may the groom and the coachman; and thus every branch of expence will be filled to your maſter's honour.</p>
                  <p>When you are child before company, (which with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our maſters and ladies is an unmannerly practice) it often happens that ſome ſtranger will have the good-nature to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0906500201:14"/>drop a word in your excuſe; in ſuch a caſe you will have a good title to juſtify yourſelf, and may righty conclude, that, whenever he chides you afterwards on other occaſions, he may be in the wrong; in which opinion you will be the better confirmed by ſtating the caſe to your fellow ſervants in your own way, who will certainly decide in your favour: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I have ſaid before, whenever you are chidden, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as if you were injured.</p>
                  <p>It often happens, that ſervants ſent on meſſages are apt to ſtay out ſomewhat longer than the meſſage requires, perhaps two, four, ſix, or eight hours, or ſome ſuch trifle; for the temptation to be ſure was great, and fleſh and blood cannot always reſiſt: when you return, the maſter ſtorms, the lady ſcolds; ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, cudgelling, and turning off, is the word. But here you ought to be provided with a ſett of excuſes, enough to ſerve on all occaſions: for inſtance, your uncle came four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore miles to town this morning on purpoſe to ſee you, and goes back by break of day to-morrow; a brother-ſervant, that borrowed money of you when he was out of place, was run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away to Ireland; you were taking leave of an old fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervant, who was ſhipping for Barbadoes; your father ſent a cow to you to ſell, and you could not get a chapman till nine at night; you were taking leave of a dear couſin, who is to be hanged next Saturday; you wrenched your foot againſt a ſtone, and were forced to ſtay three hours in a ſhop, before you could ſtir a ſtep; ſome naſtineſs was thrown on you out of a garret-window, and you were aſhamed to come home before you were cleaned, and the ſmell went off; you were preſſed for the ſea-ſervice, and carried before a juſtice of peace, who kept you three hours before he examined you, and you got off with much ado; a bailiff by miſtake ſeized you for a debtor, and kept you the whole evening in a ſpunging-houſe: you were told your maſter had gone to a tavern, and came to ſome miſchance, and your grief was ſo great that you enquired for his honour in an hundred taverns between Pall Mall and Temple Bar.</p>
                  <p>Take all tradeſmen's parts againſt your maſter; and when you are ſent to buy any thing, never offer to cheapen it, but generouſly pay the full demand. This is highly to your maſter's honour; and may be ſome ſhillings in your pocket; and you are to conſider, if your maſter hath paid too much, he can better afford the loſs than a poor tradeſman.</p>
                  <p>Never ſubmit to ſtir a finger in any buſineſs, but that for which you was particularly hired. For example, if the groom be drunk, or abſent, and the butler be ordered to ſhut the ſtable door, the anſwer is ready, "An pleaſe your honour, I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0906500201:15"/>don't underſtand horſes:" If a corner of the hanging wants a ſingle nail to faſten it, and the footman be directed to tack it up, he may ſay he doth not underſtand that ſort of work, but his honour may ſend for the upholſterer.</p>
                  <p>Maſters and ladies are uſually quarrelling with the ſervants for not ſhutting the doors after them: for neither maſters nor ladies conſider, that thoſe doors muſt be open before they can be ſhut, and that the labour is double to open and ſhut the doors; therefore the beſt, the ſhorteſt, and eaſieſt way, is to do neither. But if you are ſo often teazed to ſhut the door, that you cannot eaſily forget it, then give the door ſuch a clap as you go out, as will ſhake the whole room, and make every thing rattle in it, to put your maſter and lady in mind that you obſerve their directions.</p>
                  <p>If you find yourſelf to grow into favour with your maſter or lady, take ſome opportunity, in a very mild way, to give them warning; and when they aſk the reaſon, and ſeem loth to part with you, anſwer that you would rather live with them than any body elſe, but a poor ſervant is not to be blamed if he ſtrives to better himſelf; that ſervice is no inheritance; that your work is great, and your wages very ſmall. Upon which, if your maſter hath any generoſity, he will add five or ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a quarter rather than let you go; but if you are baulked, and have no mind to go off, get ſome fellow-ſervant to tell your maſter that he hath prevailed upon you to ſtay.</p>
                  <p>Whatever good bits you can pilfer in the day, ſave them to junket with your fellow-ſervants at night; and take in the butler, provided he will give you drink.</p>
                  <p>Write your own name, and your ſweetheart's, with the ſmoak of a candle, on the roof of the kitchen, or the ſervants-hall, to ſhew your learning.</p>
                  <p>If you are a young ſightly fellow, whenever you whiſper your miſtreſs at the table, run your noſe full in her cheek; or, if your breath be good, breathe full in her face: this I have known to have had very good conſequences in ſome families.</p>
                  <p>Never come till you have been called three or four times; for none but dogs will come at the firſt whiſtle: and when the maſter calls, "Who's there?" no ſervant is bound to come; for Who's There is nobody's name.</p>
                  <p>When you have broken all your earthen drinking veſſels below ſtairs, (which is uſually done in a week) the copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot will do as well; it can boil milk, heat porridge, hold ſmall-beer, or in caſe of neceſſity ſerve for a jordan: therefore apply it indifferently to all theſe uſes; but never waſh or ſcour it, for fear of taking off the tin.</p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0906500201:16"/>Although you are allowed knives for the ſervants-hall at meals, yet you ought to ſpare them, and make uſe only of your maſter's.</p>
                  <p>Let it be a conſtant rule, that no chair, ſtool, or table, in the ſervants-hall, or the kitchen, ſhall have above three legs, which hath been the ancient and conſtant practice in all the families I ever knew, and is ſaid to be founded upon two reaſons; firſt, to ſhew that ſervants are ever in a tottering condition; ſecondly, it was thought a point of humility, that the ſervants chairs and tables ſhould have at leaſt one leg fewer than thoſe of their maſters. I grant there hath been an exception to this rule with regard to the cook, who by old cuſtom was allowed an eaſy-chair to ſleep in after dinner; and yet I have ſeldom ſeen them with above three legs. Now this epidemical lameneſs of ſervants chairs is by philoſophers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to two cauſes, which are obſerved to make the greateſt revolutions in ſtates and empires; I mean, love and war. A ſtool, a chair, or a table, is the firſt weapon taken up in a general romping or ſkirmiſh; and after a peace, the chairs, if they be not very ſtrong, are apt to ſuffer in the conduct of an amour, the cook being uſually fat and heavy, and the butler a little in drink.</p>
                  <p>I could never enduce to ſee maid-ſervants ſo ungenteel as to walk the ſtreets with their petticoats pinned up; it is a fooliſh excuſe, to alledge their-petticoats will be dirty, when they have ſo eaſy a remedy as to walk three or four times down a clean pair of ſtairs after they come home.</p>
                  <p>When you ſtop to tattle with ſome crony ſervant in the ſame ſtreet, leave your own ſtreet-door open, that you may get in without knocking when you come back; otherwiſe your miſtreſs may know you are gone out, and you muſt be chidden.</p>
                  <p>I do moſt earneſtly exhort you all to unanimity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Believe an old practitioner; whoever, out of malice to a fellow-ſervant, carries a tale to his maſter, ſhall be ruined by a general confederacy againſt him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0906500201:17"/>When any ſervant comes home drunk, and cannot appear, you muſt all join in telling your maſter, that he is gone to bed ſick; upon which your lady will be ſo good-natured as to order ſome comfortable thing for the poor man or maid.</p>
                  <p>When your maſter or lady go abroad together to dinner, or on a viſit for the evening, you need leave only one ſervant in the houſe, unleſs you have a black-guard boy to anſwer at the door, and attend the children, if there be any. Who is to ſtay at home is to be determined by ſhort and long cuts, and the ſtayer at home may be comforted by a viſit from a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart, without danger of being caught together. Theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities muſt never be miſſed, becauſe they come but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and all is ſafe enough while there is a ſervant in the houſe.</p>
                  <p>When your maſter or lady comes home, and wants a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who happens to be abroad, your anſwer muſt be, that he had but juſt that minute ſtept out, being ſent for by a couſin who was dying.</p>
                  <p>If your maſter calls you by name, and you happen to anſwer at the fourth call, you need not hurry yourſelf; and if you be chidden for ſtaying, you may lawfully ſay, you came no ſooner becauſe you did not know what you were called for.</p>
                  <p>When you are chidden for a fault, as you go out of the room and down ſtairs, mutter loud enough to be plainly heard; this will make him believe you are innocent.</p>
                  <p>Whoever comes to viſit your maſter or lady when they are abroad, never burden your memory with the perſon's name, for indeed you have too many other things to remember: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is a porter's buſineſs, and your maſter's fault he does not keep one, and who can remember names? and you will certainly miſtake them, and you can neither write nor read.</p>
                  <p>If it be poſſible, never tell a lye to your maſter or lady, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you have ſome hopes that they cannot find it out in leſs than half an hour. When a ſervant is turned off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

[Inſtance them.] And when they aſk any of you, why you never acquainted them before? the anſwer is, "Sir," or "Madam, really I was afraid it would make you angry; and beſides, perhaps, you might think it was malice in me." Where there are little maſters and miſſes in a houſe, they are uſually great impediments to the diverſions of the ſervants; the only remedy is to bride them with Goody Goodies, that they may not tell tales to papa and mamma.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0906500201:18"/>when a ſtranger is taking his leave; ſo that he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity paſs between you, and he muſt have more confidence, or leſs money than uſual, if any of you let him eſcape; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he behaves himſelf, remember to treat him the next time he comes.</p>
                  <p>If you are ſent with ready-money to buy any thing at a ſhop, and happen at that time to be out of pocket, ſink the money, and take up the goods on your maſter's account. This is for the honour of your maſter and yourſelf; for he becomes a man of credit at your recommendation.</p>
                  <p>When your lady ſends for you up to her chamber to give you any orders, be ſure to ſtand at the door, and keep it open, fiddling with the lock all the while ſhe is talking to you, and keep the button in your hand, for fear you ſhould forget to ſhut the door after you.</p>
                  <p>If your maſter or lady happen once in their lives to accuſe you wrongfully, you are a happy ſervant; for you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do, than for every fault you commit while you are in their ſervice to put them in mind of that falſe accuſation, and proteſt yourſelf equally innocent in the preſent caſe.</p>
                  <p>When you have a mind to leave your maſter, and are too baſhful to break the matter for fear of offending him, the beſt way is to grow rude and ſaucy of a ſudden, and beyond your uſual behaviour, till he finds it neceſſary to turn you off; and when you are gone, to revenge yourſelf, give him and his lady ſuch a character to all your brother ſervants who are out of place, that none will venture to offer their ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Some nice ladies, who are afraid of catching cold, having obſerved that the maids and fellows below-ſtairs often forget to ſhut the door after them, as they come in, or go out into the back-yards, have contrived that a pulley and a rope, with a large piece of lead at the end, ſhould be ſo fixed, as to make the door ſhut of itſelf, and require a ſtrong hand to open it, which is an immenſe toil to ſervants, whoſe buſineſs may force them to go in and out fifty times in a morning: but ingenuity can do much; for prudent ſervants have found out an effectual remedy againſt this inſupportable grievance, by tying up the pulley in ſuch a manner, that the weight of lead ſhall have no effect; however, as to my own part, I would rather chuſe to keep the door always open by laying a heavy ſtone at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſervants candleſticks are generally broken, for nothing can laſt for ever. But you may find out many expedients; you may conveniently ſtick your candle in a bottle, or with a lump of butter againſt the wainſcot, in a powder-horn, or in an old ſhoe, or in a cleft-ſtick, or in the barrel of a piſtol,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0906500201:19"/>or upon it's own greaſe on a table, in a coffee-cup, or a drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſs, a horn-cann, a tea-pot, a twiſted napkin, a muſtard-pot, an inkhorn, a marrow-bone, a piece of dough, or you may cut a hole in the loaf and ſtick it there.</p>
                  <p>When you invi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e the neighbouring ſervants to junket with you at home in an evening, teach them a peculiar way of tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or ſcraping at the kitchen-window, which you may hear, but not your maſter or lady, whom you muſt take care not to diſturb or frighten at ſuch unſeaſonable hours.</p>
                  <p>Lay all faults upon a lap-dog, or favourite cat, a monkey, a parrot, a child, or on the ſervant who was laſt turned off; by this rule you will excuſe yourſelf, do no hurt to any body elſe, and ſave your maſter or lady from the trouble and vexation of chiding.</p>
                  <p>When you want proper inſtruments for any work you are about, uſe all expedients you can invent, rather than leave your work undone. For inſtance, if the poker be out of the way, or broken, ſtir the fire with the tongs; if the tongs be not at hand, uſe the muzzle of the bellows, the wrong end of the fire-ſhovel, the handle of the fire-bruſh, the end of a mop, or your maſter's cane. If you want paper to ſinge a fowl, tear the firſt book you ſee about the houſe. Wipe your ſhoes, for want of a clout, with the bottom of a curtain, or a damaſk napkin. Strip your livery-lace for garters. If the butler wants a jordan, he may uſe the great ſilver cup.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral ways of putting out candles, and you ought to be inſtructed in them all: you may run the candle-end againſt the wainſcot, which puts the ſnuff out immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; you may lay it on the ground, and tread the ſnuff out with your foot; you may hold it upſide-down, until it is choaked with it's own greaſe; or cram it into the ſocket of the candleſtick; you may whirl it round in your hand till it goes out; when you go to bed, after you have made water, you may dip the candle-end into the chamber-pot; you may ſpit on your finger and thumb, and pinch the ſnuff till it goes out. The cook may run the candle's noſe into the meal-tub, or the groom into a veſſel of oats, or a lock of hay, or a heap of litter; the houſe-maid may put out her candle by running it againſt a looking-glaſs, which nothing cleans ſo well as candle-ſnuff; but the quickeſt and beſt of all methods is, to blow it out with your breath, which leaves the candle clear, and readier to be lighted.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing ſo pernicious in a family as a tell-tale, againſt whom it muſt be the principal buſineſs of you all to unite: whatever office he ſerves in, take all opportunities to ſpoil the buſineſs he is about, and to croſs him in every thing.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0906500201:20"/>For inſtance, if the butler be a tell-tale, break his glaſſes when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he leaves the pantry-door open; or lock the cat or the maſtiff in it, who will do as well; or miſlay a fork or a ſpoon, ſo as he may never find it. If it be the cook, whenever ſhe turns her back, throw a lump of ſoot, or a handful of ſalt, in the pot, or ſmoaking coals into the dripping-pan, or daub the roaſt-meat with the back of the chimney, or hide the key of the jack. If a footman be ſuſpected, let the cook daub the back of his new livery; or when he is going up with a diſh of ſoup, let her follow him ſoftly with a ladle-full, and dribble it all the way up ſtairs to the dining-room, and then let the houſe-maid make ſuch a noiſe that her lady may hear it. The waiting-maid is very likely to be guilty of this fault in hopes to ingratiate herſelf: in this caſe, the laundreſs muſt be ſure to tear her ſmocks in the waſhing, and yet waſh them but half; and, when ſhe complains, tell all the houſe that ſhe ſweats ſo much, and her fleſh is ſo naſty, that ſhe ſouls a ſmock more in one hour, than the kitchen-maid doth in a week.</p>

                  <p>THERE are a ſet of men in the world, of ſuch a tedious, tireſome, trifling, troubleſome habitude, temper, and diſpoſition of mind, that they perplex, confound, entangle, and puzzle, every circumſtance in every cauſe which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, protect, defend, and juſtify. Inſtead of coming to the point, matter, buſineſs, or debate, they deviate, vary, waver, and fly off therefrom. When we expect truth, ſatisfaction, conviction, and deciſion, we find, perceive, obſerve, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, nothing but uncertainty, ambiguity, doubtfulneſs, and difficulty. This, my lord, I humbly apprehend, conceive, think, preſume, and furmiſe, is owing to tediouſneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity; the nature, genius, and extent of which, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, weigh, examine, explicate, and ſcrutinize. In the firſt place, then, I ſhall ſhew, prove, and demonſtrate, the nature of tediouſneſs and prolixity, by ſhewing, proving, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating, that there is nothing ſo unnatural; for the buſineſs of a tongue, utterance, ſpeech, or language, is to come to the point, argument, contemplation, or queſtion, at once, point-blank, ſlap-daſh, and conciſely, without any prevarication, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, retardation, or circumbendibus whatſoever. And now, in the ſecond, ſucceeding, following place, point, and preliminary, I come to promulgate the genius of tediouſneſs and prolixity; which is done, effected, performed, and brought about, by maniſeſting that they have no genius at all: and ſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0906500201:21"/>far from any men of genius making uſe of them, none but your egregious, abſurd, ridiculous dolts, dunderheads, and block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, ever admit, acknowledge, receive, or embrace, any ſuch notions, ideas, maxims, principles, or tenets. Thirdly, my lord, I beg leave, according to order, form, ſeries, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, to animadvert upon the extent of tediouſneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity; and this is managed by demonſtrating that it is infinite and without bounds, and conſequently can have no extent at all. And now, my lord, I will open the cauſe, ſpring, origin, fountain, riſe, and foundation, of theſe vices, which is Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; which is the ſpeaking, ſaying, delivering, uttering, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, divulging, declaring, remarking, obſerving, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or expreſſing, the ſame identical, individual thing, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and an hundred, and an hundred, and an hundred, and an hundred hundred hundred times over. And now, my lord, I beg leave, pardon, permiſſion, and ſufferance, to lay down only ſix and fifty particulars: every particular, my lord, ſhall conſiſt of only ſeventy-two diviſions; every diviſion ſhall comprehend, contain, and conſiſt of only eighty-two ſub-diviſions; every ſub-diviſion ſhall be concluded with the ſix and fortieth article; and every article ſhall conſume, expend, and coſt, no more than an hour and an half.</p>

                  <head>PLATE II. THE INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE PERFORMING THE DUTY OF A CHRISTIAN.</head>
                  <p>THOUGH this print may ſeem, to a curſory obſerver, leſs ſtriking and important than any of the whole ſeries, it is in fact of the very firſt conſequence. It is, by attending the publick worſhip of the Supreme Being, with becoming piety, that virtue is ſtrengthened; and it is by the neglect of this duty, that vice gains ground of it's victim. From this ſcene Tom Idle is excluded. With him it was no favourite place; for, during the hours of devotion, it will in the next print be ſeen that he was far differently employed.</p>
                  <p>The induſtrious youth, Francis Goodchild, is in this print repreſented at Spitalfields church, aſſiſting in the performance of divine worſhip; and he is honoured with the company of Miſs Weſt, his maſter's daughter, in the ſame pew, to whom his features bear a not very diſtant reſemblance. They have both a ſweet placidity of countenance. Piety and ſimplicity are manifeſt in their deportment; and they ſeem, at firſt ſight, evidently made for each other.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the ſolemnity of the place, Hogarth has contrived to give us ſome ludicrous figures, without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent departure from nature. The fat groteſque female in the upper corner; the man near her, accompanying the organ with his deep-toned vocal exertions; and him beneath, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſleeping and waking," who joins in the ſonorous chorus;

                  <p>The rules of perſpective are, in this print, purpoſely violated, to give an idea of a crouded congregation; but the figures, in general, are ſo minute, that their merits are imperceptible. Where they are viſible, character is to be traced in each.</p>
                  <p>On a ſlight examination of this print, we felt a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to cenſure Hogarth for neglecting to preſent us with the worthy Mr. Weſt attending divine worſhip with his family, and thus ſtrengthening the moral effect. But we ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that this, far from being an error, was a merit beyond vulgar view, ſince the abſence of the maſter the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for that of his vicious apprentice.</p>

                  <head>THE TAYLOR'S SOLILOQUY.</head>
                  <byline>BY MR. HARRISON.</byline>
                  <p>TO be, or not to be—a Taylor? That is the queſtion. Shall I, who feel myſelf a man; yes, every inch a man! have but one-ninth of my juſt claim allowed, as if it were my bill, taxed by too rigid Juſtice; who, being blind, ſees not the riſque I run? Forbid it, Heaven! I am a man; and a man of conſequence too, for no man is a man without me. Even kings would be Sans Culottes, if I turned traitor, and refuſed to make them breeches; and who would reverence their bench of judges, and their bench of biſhops, if I did not manuſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture furred gowns and lawn ſleeves? Yes! law, divinity, and phyſick too, all ſtand indebted to me for their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: I am, therefore, not only a man, but a man of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. What would our ſailors do, thoſe brave fellows to whom we chiefly owe the ſafety of our country itſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jackets and trowſers? why, they would be as bare-bottomed as ſo many Mounſeers, and then we ſhould ſee that they had no more bottom neither. The ſoldiers, too, they would cut a very pretty figure, to be ſure, without me! Why, zounds! it's enough to make a man ſwear; but, as I am a man—damme! I muſt be a man, for no animal on earth but a man ever ſwears—yes, ſurely as I am a man, the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the girls all run to the parade, to the parks, to every review, to the camps, and to all places after the ſoldiers, where ſoldiers are to be ſeen, is becauſe they are ſo ſmartly cloathed by me. What makes ſoldiers, in their eyes, look
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0906500201:32"/>ſo handſome, but the ſcarlet cloth, the buff, and the blue, in which I dreſs them; the gold lace, and the worſted lace, the gold epaulets, and the worſted epaulets, with which I trim the moſt valiant dogs in the world? A taylor, then, is not only a man, but a man of valour, ſince he trims them all. At court, who would be introduced into the royal preſence, without my preparing them for a good reception? Does it ſignify one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what is within, provided as how I have the management of the outſide. In courting, too, as well as at court, are not ninety-nine women out of every hundred, more governed in their choice by my part of the object, than any other conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation whatever. "A good <hi>coat,</hi>" as the old ſong <hi>ſhould</hi> ſay, "and a light pair of breeches, go through the world." If a man has no credit with his taylor, he has none elſewhere; nobody will admit a man of merit out at elbows into his houſe; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body will ſpeak to genius cloathed with rags in the ſtreet. But let me have the dreſſing of the vile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t raſcal in the univerſe, and ſee if he is not welcomed like a prince in every faſhionable circle. Is it not dreſs that makes him a gentleman? Is it not me that regulates the faſhions? I, therefore, muſt be a gentleman, as well as a man of faſhion. Can any man, who is not well cloathed by me, cloath the beſt ſtory in the world ſo as to be reckoned wit in polite company? And will not the moſt threadbare joke, uttered by one whom I have thus qualified, convulſe the very ſame circle with laughter. I am, therefore, the maker of wit; and muſt, of courſe, be a man of wit. Shall I, then, who can do all theſe great things, be caſt off, and deſpiſed, like an old garment, the inſtant I quit my ſhop-board? Shall I, who am not only a man, but a man of conſequence; not only a man of conſequence, but a man of importance; not only a man of importance, but a man of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; not only a man of valour, but a gentleman; not only a gentleman, but a man of wit; be bawled after, by every ſhabby, ragged raſcal, whenever I fetch a walk with Mrs. Snip, my daughter Dolly, or ſome favourite girl—"Look! there goes Snip, the taylor; the ninth part of a man!" and, when I mount my nag, juſt to take an airing in the duſt of Hyde Park, like my cuſtomers, ſee every one turning ſinger-poſt, and hear them cry, "Twig the taylor riding to Brentford!" while a wag ſlily contrives to make a ſlip of paper reſembling a meaſure dangle from my pocket? Shall I, who know ſo well how to live, and how to live well too, be thus made weary of my life, or even of my livelihood, by a ſet of ragamuſſios? Poets and philoſophers prate that a bare bodkin will <hi>quiet us;</hi> a bare breech! I was going to ſay. It might quiet us, but would it quiet the devil? He, I am told, will not be cheated out of his own, like a poor taylor by his bad cuſtomers: and I ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0906500201:33"/>chuſe, ſince I am obliged to give long credit, to have as long allowed me as poſſible. They may talk of ſhuffling off life, but I had rather ſhuffle through life. Conſcience, they ſay, makes cowards of us all: but a taylor has no conſcience; ergo, a taylor is no coward. Shall I, who am a man of ſo many functions, ſubmit to be thus treated, without reply? No if they could cut me as ſmall as cabbage, put me in the fire like my gooſe, freeze me into the coldneſs of my favourite cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers, or ſend me to hell itſelf, I will ſpeak—while I am a man. The world ſhall hear of my ill-uſage; and, if I do not experience more reſpect, each mother's ſon ſhall be reduced to the primitive fig-leaf apron—or, I will make them all pay ſwingeingly for every article of dreſs they get from me; and thus, in my turn—laugh in my ſleeve! Damme, who's afraid!</p>

                     <salute>MR. EDITOR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHILE you and your correſpondents are ſo laudably employed in watching over the welfare of the ſtate, keeping a jealous eye on our miniſters, and pointing out the <hi>errors</hi> of government, I wiſh, (if you could but find time for it) that you would pay ſome little attention to your own <hi>errors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will appear the higheſt degree of preſumption to offer advice to a perſon in <hi>your</hi> eminent ſtation; <hi>one</hi> who every day (Sundays excepted) dictates to miniſters, and counſels kings; <hi>one</hi> who is read and admired in every part of the Britiſh dominions.</p>
                  <p>It is for this very reaſon, Sir, that I think it incumbent on me to tell you of your <hi>miſtakes;</hi> for you cannot ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Albeit that I have erred, mine</hi> ERROR <hi>remaineth with</hi> MY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF.</q> No, Mr. Editor, <hi>your</hi> errors circulate far and wide; they miſrepreſent many, and miſlead more; in ſhort, the errors I mean, are <hi>errors of the preſs,</hi> or, as my <hi>learned</hi> friend <hi>Sir James Hodges</hi> expreſſes them, in <hi>one</hi> Engliſh-Latin-ſingular-plural word, <hi>erratums.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of all errata, the moſt <hi>harmleſs</hi> are thoſe which make ſtark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaring <hi>nonſenſe.</hi> Theſe are never imputed to the writer, but are corrected by the reader, in his own mind, as he goes along; but the <hi>dangerous</hi> ones are thoſe which make a kind of half-ſenſe, and paſs current as the ſenſe of the <hi>author,</hi> until the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0906500201:34"/>day following, when your liſt of errata transfers the blame from the writer to the printer. However, I muſt ſay that printers (with all their profeſſions of candour) are as little apt to acknowledge <hi>their</hi> errors as the reſt of mankind: for not one erratum in ten is ever acknowledged; and, indeed, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they very ſeldom would, unleſs at the particular deſire of the writer.</p>
                  <p>As I have ſaid much about the <hi>errors of the preſs,</hi> it may naturally be expected that I ſhould produce ſome proofs of what I have aſſerted. This I am enabled to do, having paid particular attention to them for ſome time paſt, and having looked more ſharply after them, than the promotions civil or military, the prices of corn or of ſtocks, the liſt of ſhips or bankrupts, or of thoſe paragraphs which inform who is dead, who is married, or who is hanged.</p>
                  <p>But now for the particulars of the charge—I have known you throw an injurious reflection on all the crowned heads in Europe at one ſtroke; for, inſtead of <hi>potentates,</hi> you have called them <hi>potatoes,</hi> as if they had been <hi>mere vegetables.</hi> As to the King of Pruſſia, you talk of <hi>him</hi> in a different ſtile; for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Hero</hi> of Pruſſia, you have made him the <hi>Nero.</hi> Next day comes your apology, or <hi>erratum,</hi> which ſometimes, inſtead of mending matters, makes things worſe; and, like an arch-tinker, in ſtopping one hole makes two: as, I remember, my old friend Alderman Faulkner of Dublin, corrected an error in <hi>his</hi> Journal, "Erratum in our laſt, for <hi>his</hi> Grace the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of Dorſet, read <hi>her</hi> Grace the <hi>Duke</hi> of Dorſet." Indeed, a blunder ſeems to be ſomething of the nature of a <hi>bog.</hi> the more you ſtruggle, the deeper you get into it. But, to proceed. You have, on ſeveral occaſions, uſed the <hi>Doge</hi> of Genoa extremely ill, and never have made him the leaſt apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for omitting the laſt letter in his title; though, if you <hi>had</hi> deſired your readers, next day, inſtead of <hi>Dog</hi> to read <hi>Doge,</hi> I do confeſs that it would have been no great reparation.</p>
                  <p>I remember the Iriſh parliament, ſome time ago, were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at ſomething in your paper; and took up the matter ſo <hi>warmly,</hi> that they ordered the paper to be burnt. Now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>you,</hi> Mr. Editor, have taken umbrage alſo and like-<hi>wiſe,</hi> or whether it proceeds from negligence, I know not; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that ſeveral unlucky miſtakes have happened relative to that reſpectable body. At their firſt meeting, you told us, (inſtead of a <hi>bili</hi>) that a motion would be made for leave to bringin a <hi>bull;</hi> and, afterwards, another motion, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Dey</hi> be read, as if it was an aſſembly on the coaſt of <hi>Barbary</hi>—You told us, one day, that <hi>Lord</hi>—, of the kingdom of Ireland, had been ſafely delivered of a daughter;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0906500201:35"/>and we were all very anxious on my lord's account, till the day following, when you delivered his lordſhip of the burden, and brought the child into the world a more natural way.</p>
                  <p>In a late ſcuffle under the Piazza, Covent Garden, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us that an Iriſh officer had got a <hi>confuſion</hi> in his head; and you made no apology afterwards, thinking, I ſuppoſe, there was no occaſion for any, as you were right to a <hi>t.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long ago you advertiſed a ſpeedy cure for <hi>raptures;</hi> and I am afraid it gave ſome wicked batchelor occaſion to ſcoff at the holy ſtate of matrimony; for, as the devil would have it, (I mean one of <hi>your</hi> devils) the very next advertiſement to it was from a gentleman who wanted a wife, and over it was printed MATRIMONY in capitals; conſequently, it appeared, that <hi>matrimony</hi> was the moſt ſpeedy and effectual cure for <hi>raptures,</hi> though of ever ſo long ſtanding, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I have known you advertiſe, inſtead of a <hi>never</hi>-failing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, an <hi>ever</hi>-failing remedy: now, Sir, though this might be ſtrictly true, "yet I hold it not proper that it ſhould be ſo ſet down," as I ſuppoſe the quack-doctor paid you his money for conveying a very different ſenſe to the publick. In a receipt lately publiſhed for the cure of the plague, inſtead of <hi>rue,</hi> you put <hi>rice;</hi> and ſo made a <hi>pudding</hi> of it; and in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing a courſe of lectures, you turned a <hi>ſyllabus</hi> into a <hi>ſyllabub;</hi> and called the perpetual <hi>motion</hi> a perpetual <hi>notion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wiſh you would be a little more cautious in advertiſing <hi>Salivation not neceſſary;</hi> for it happened, by omitting the <hi>i</hi> in ſalivation, you gave great offence to ſome very good chriſtians in my neigbourhood; and alſo gave occaſion to ſome wicked <hi>punſters</hi> to obſerve, that it was not the <hi>firſt</hi> time an <hi>eye</hi> had been loſt in ſalivation; nay, that ſome people had been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky as to loſe a <hi>couple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another advertiſement which frequently occurs, beginning with—<hi>"Whereas ſeveral evil-minded perſons, &amp;c."</hi> —One day you made it evil-minded <hi>parſons,</hi> which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unlucky; for, in theſe times of <hi>infidelity,</hi> people are too apt to ſcoff at the clergy, and indeed at all ſerious ſubjects: as to myſelf, I muſt confeſs that I am particularly hurt at thoſe <hi>impertinent levities</hi> with which ſome people indulge themſelves, being a perſon of a ſerious turn of mind, and of a diſpoſition rather ſaturnine and grave.</p>
                  <p>It too often happens, Mr. Editor, that "what ſhould be <hi>grave</hi> you turn to <hi>farce.</hi>" I remember, in your paper, a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pathetick letter, ſigned a <hi>Citizen;</hi> he laments the <hi>internal</hi> ſtate of this country, and <hi>you</hi> made it the <hi>infernal</hi> ſtate; when he exclaimed, ſad <hi>reverſe!</hi> you made him cry our, ſad <hi>reverie:</hi> he diſapproved of all <hi>national</hi> reflections, you made him diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0906500201:36"/>of all <hi>rational</hi> reflections; and, talking of the <hi>fate</hi> of empires, you made him ſay the <hi>fat</hi> of empires. Now, as there are ſo many ſtanding jokes about citizens being fond of <hi>fat</hi>— whether turtle fat or veniſon fat—this unlucky miſtake quite ſpoiled the letter, diſobliged my friend the <hi>Citizen,</hi> and "all the fat was in the fire." And here I cannot help taking notice of a paragraph ſome time ſince, containing an account of the election of a a worthy alderman for a certain ward, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſaying he was <hi>duly</hi> elected, you ſay he was <hi>dully</hi> elected, and thereby afforded a handle for breaking ſome common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place jeſts on that reſpectable body of men the Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Another time, in the account of an entertainment given by a worthy alderman to the deputy and common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of his ward, where they <hi>dined</hi> on the turtle, you ſaid they <hi>died</hi> on the turtle; as if they had all eat till they choaked or burſt; whereas, on the contrary, it was extremely remarkable, that none either over-eat themſelves, or caught a ſurfeit that day.</p>
                  <p>From ſeveral articles, Mr. Editor, one would be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that you were no great <hi>geographer;</hi> for you tell us of corſairs fitted out from <hi>Turin,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Tunis;</hi> and that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> had revolted againſt the Spaniards, inſtead of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſe:</hi> now, though theſe two nations are on different ſides of the globe, I ſuppoſe you thought they were near neighbours, being within an <hi>ell</hi> of each other. Laſt year, when the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian fleet took the Iſle of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> you told us that part of the ſquadron remained at the Iſle of <hi>Candy,</hi> and the reſt were going to attack the Iſle of <hi>Lemons:</hi> you ſuppoſed, no doubt, that <hi>Candy</hi> was a ſugar iſland, and that they were going to the Iſle of <hi>Lemons</hi> for fruit, and ſo between them to ſupply the fleet— pro bono publico—with <hi>punch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have ſometimes treated the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> very injuriouſly, by calling them <hi>Ruſſians;</hi> and one day you told us the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined armies of the Turks and Tartars (inſtead of a <hi>Kam</hi>) was commanded by a <hi>Ram;</hi> as if they had been a parcel of ſheep: and when it was expected the two armies were coming to <hi>Action,</hi> you ſaid they were coming to <hi>Acton;</hi> and, as there was a conſiderable fall of Stocks at that time, I have reaſon to think it was owing to the above report, or to ſome other equally alarming.</p>
                  <p>I trembled for you during the whole time of the congreſs at <hi>Fockzany;</hi> it is a tickliſh word in the hands of a careleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor, and one does not know what terrible work he might make of it. Apropos, it is not long ſince you advertiſed a view of the canal of <hi>Venice,</hi> and you made it the canal of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> and, in the account of a houſebreaking, inſtead of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0906500201:37"/>rogues broke in at the <hi>window,</hi> you ſaid they broke in at the <hi>widow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you informed us that a certain lady was gone to paſs the holiday: at her country-ſeat near <hi>Corydon,</hi> every reader ſuppoſed that ſome <hi>ſcandal</hi> was meant, till the next day, when we learned that there was no Corydon in the caſe, and that her ladyſhip was only gone to her country-ſeat hear <hi>Croydon.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>IT has been remarked, that a bad book ought as much to be guarded againſt as a bad companion. There certainly is nothing more true, and yet the moſt dangerous are daily pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed uncenſured; and a mean, ignorant, and mercenary, or unprincipled publiſher, may ſpead poiſon daily more detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental than arſenick.

The annals of literature never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the world a more paradoxical, whimſical, ingenious, eloquent, weak, and dangerous author.</p>

In the preface to his novel, he ſays—"Chaſte girls never read romances; and the girl who reads four pages of this is undone."</p>
                  <p>Yet no books are more called for at Circulating Libraries than romances, and none more than his. With ſuch ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he gives his book to the world, and then preſumes to write on education.</p>

                  <p>IN the early part of Hogarth's life, a nobleman, who was uncommonly ugly and deformed, came to fit to him for his picture. It was executed with a ſkill that did honour to the artiſt's abilities; but the likeneſs was rigidly obſerved, without even the neceſſary attention to compliment or flattery. The peer, diſguſted at this counter-part of his dear ſelf, never once thought of paying for a reflector that would only inſult him with his deformities. Some time was ſuffered to elapſe before the artiſt applied for his money; but afterwards many applications were made by him (who had then no need of a banker) for payment, without ſucceſs. The painter, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0906500201:44"/>at laſt hit upon an expedient, which he knew muſt alarm the nobleman's pride, and by that means anſwer his purpoſe. It was couched in the following card—</p>
                  <p>"Mr. HOGARTH's dutiful reſpects to Lord —, finding that he does not mean to have the picture which was drawn for him, is informed again of Mr. Hogarth's neceſſity for the money; if, therefore, his Lordſhip does not ſend for it in three days, it will be diſpoſed of, with the addition of a tail, and ſome other little appendages, to Mr. Hare, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wild-beaſt man; Mr. Hogarth having given that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman a conditional promiſe of it for an exhibition of pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, on his Lordſhip's refuſal."</p>
                  <p>This intimation had the deſired effect: the picture was ſent for home, and committed to the flames.</p>

                  <p>That which brought her to her preſent ſituation has long preyed on her vitals. On the day juſt mentioned, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror came with irreſiſtible authority, as a king of terrors indeed, but in his mildeſt form, and laid his victorious hand on her about ten o'clock in the morning; from which time till night ſhe held a ſtate of uncertain exiſtence: at laſt, about midnight, that amiable countenance, which uſed to glow with ſweet modeſty, was ſhrouded in darkneſs, and the ſpoiler tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over beauties which were once the deſire or the envy of both ſexes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt attack of her diſorder was at a review in the Park; where Colonel Scarlet, whoſe manly and polite addreſs is ſo well known, commanded the regiment near which ſhe ſtood. A ſweetly-painful palpitation on a ſudden ſeized her till then peaceful boſom: but this gave her little alarm, ignorant as ſhe was of the nature of her malady, and by no means expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſequences which it has now produced. When ſhe came home, ſhe felt anxiety and reſtleſſneſs; yet it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that ſhe had caught cold. She was fond of ſolitude, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0906500201:45"/>apt to tremble and change colour: ſhe complained, but that only when alone, of an uneaſineſs in her breaſt; was obſerved to lean her cheek on her hand, and frequently to wipe the trickling tear which accompanied the involuntary half-broken ſigh.</p>
                  <p>Some of her friends were apprehenſive for her ſenſes; and, indeed, ſeveral of her actions appeared deſtitute of that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, good-ſenſe, and gaiety, for which ſhe was before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. To ſtudy long at her looking-glaſs; to be angry with her head-dreſs; to talk to herſelf, like one delirious, of groves and fountains, ſoldiers, parents, and wrinkled old age, with a thouſand other incoherent ſubjects; were circumſtances very ſuſpicious, indeed. But, whatever her diſorder was, ſhe was very ſhy of giving any intimation which might lead to a diſcovery of it.</p>
                  <p>It is proper you ſhould know, that Colonel Scarlet was by this time pretty intimate at her father's, and from him was learned what chiefly led her friends to a knowledge of her complaint. They endeavoured to adminiſter ſuch remedies as were calculated to remove her diſeaſe, but in vain; it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently increaſed. A jaunt into the country, a round of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant amuſements, ſolitude, or company, ſeemed each to feed her complaint, rather than remove it. The attention of the colonel to her ſituation, at this time, was exceedingly diligent and tender; be profeſſed the utmoſt concern for her welfare, and intereſted himſelf in all that was done for her: his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-feat, his coach, and his fortune, were all at her ſervice; and he ſeemed willing to give even himſelf for her happineſs.</p>
                  <p>In this ſituation of things, and as the laſt reſource—all other advice proving ineffectual—recourſe was had to a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman. He ſpoke to her very ſeriouſly concerning the change of ſtate before her; enquired into the ſituation of her mind, with reſpect to the approaching awful period; informed her of the new birth to be expected, the remedy againſt ſin, and the ſociety and comfort of the bliſsful manſions, quoting ſeveral texts to the purpoſe. He gave her many ſuitable exhortations to love her lord with all her heart, and obey his will; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected her concerning the endowment of wordly goods, and ſuch other ſubjects as are common on theſe occaſions. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all which exhortations ſhe ſeemed in great agitation, and made anſwer with a faltering tongue; hope and tear, ſhame, joy, and trembling apprehenſion, alternately poſſeſſing her breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Her father gave her up with great compoſure, but her mother not without many tears. The colonel, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and much intereſted in all that paſſed, gave her ſeveral
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0906500201:46"/>tokens of his high eſteem and good wiſhes, which ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with down-caſt eyes and a ſcarcely audible voice. The ſpectators ſeemed to think her exceedingly well prepared, and whiſpered to each other about her uprightneſs, faith, virtue, conſtancy, and a thouſand other amiable qualifications for a ſtate of happineſs.</p>
                  <p>When this ſcene was over, ſhe appeared ſomewhat more compoſed, and taſted a little, and but a little, refreſhment. She ſeemed to have forebodings of her fate, and expected that night to commence her ſtate of laſting miſery or bliſs.</p>
                  <p>Some of her young female acquaintance helped her to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and endeavoured to conſole her. They told her, that it was what they muſt all come to; that they doubted not ſhe would be happy; and ſympathetically wiſhed, that their time was alſo come. This afforded but little allay to her anxious expectation; ſhe expreſſed great backwardneſs to depart, and trembled to think what torments ſhe might ere long endure. Then, turning her thoughts to the brighter ſcenes, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her hope, that however ſharp the ſtruggles of nature might be, ſhe ſhould nevertheleſs experience all beyond them to be delight and joy. Taking, therefore, an affectionate fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of her young companions, ſhe compoſed herſelf to meet her deſtiny; and, with a groan, was received into the boſom of her lord.</p>

                  <head>LOVE-LETTER, FROM AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY TO A WIDOW WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN.</head>
                  <p>THOUGH I never, Madam, had the happineſs to ſee you—no, not ſo much as in a picture—and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently can no more tell what complexion you are of than one who lives in the remoteſt parts of China, I am neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs moſt paſſionately in love with you; and this affection has taken ſuch deep root in my heart, that, on my conſcience! I could die a martyr for you with as much chearfulneſs as thouſands have done for their religion, who were as ignorant of the truth for which they died as I am of your ladyſhip.</p>
                  <p>This declaration, Madam, may ſurprize you; but you will ceaſe to wonder, when I have acquainted you what it was that not only gave birth to my paſſion, but has effectually confirmed it. Laſt week, having occaſion to ride into Surry, about ſome particular buſineſs, I noticed, not far from the road, a moſt magnificent ſeat. My curioſity was inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly raiſed to know the owner of ſo beautiful a pile; and,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0906500201:47"/>being informed that it belongs to your ladyſhip, I began that very moment to have a very ſtrong inclination for you. When, therefore, I was farther aſſured that ſome two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand acres of the beſt ground in England appertained to this noble fabrick, together with a fine park, delightful gardens, variety of fiſh-ponds, and other deſirable conveniences, I then fell up to the ears in love, and reſolved to enliſt myſelf among the number of your humble ſervants and ſincere admirers.</p>
                  <p>"The owner of ſo many fine things," ſaid I to myſelf, "muſt needs be the fineſt women in the world. What though ſhe be old—her trees are green! What though ſhe may have loſt the lilies and the roſes in her cheeks—ſhe has enough left in her gardens! What though ſhe ſhould be barren—her fields are ſufficiently fruitful."</p>
                  <p>With theſe thoughts in my head, I alighted from my horſe, and at once became ſo enamoured of your ladyſhip, that I told my paſſion to every tree in your park: and, by the bye, they are the talleſt, ſtraighteſt, lovelieſt, fineſt ſhaped-trees, I ever beheld in my life.</p>
                  <p>I now appeal to your ladyſhip, whether any lover was ever influenced by more ſolid motives than your devoted humble ſervant. Thoſe who are wholly captivated by beauty, will infallibly find their paſſion decay with the tranſitory charm which at firſt attracted their regard; and thoſe who pretend to admire a woman merely for the qualities of her mind, muſt conſider her ſoul as abſtracted from her body: but he who loves not a woman in the fleſh, as well as in the ſpirit, is only fit, in my opinion, to make love to a ſpectre; whereas my paſſion, the ſincerity of which you cannot poſſibly doubt is built on the ſame foundation with your houſe, grows with your trees, and will daily increaſe with your eſtate.</p>
                  <p>For any thing I know to the contrary, you may be the handſomeſt woman in the kingdom; but, whether you are ſo or not, ſignifies little, while you have fortune enough to ſix my affection. I am a ſoldier my profeſſion; and, as I have fought for pay, by Heaven's bleſſing! I mean to love for money.</p>
                  <p>All your other ſuitors would ſpeak the ſame language, if they were equally honeſt; and, ſhould you favour this blunt addreſs, by making choice of me, I can add, for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that you will be the firſt woman on record, from the creation to the preſent hour, who ever loved a man for telling her the truth.</p>
                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>THE WIDOW's ANSWER.</head>
                     <p>THOUGH, Sir, I have never had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing you, and my fancy cannot poſſibly form an idea of your perſon, from the ingenuous frankneſs of your epiſtle, and the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0906500201:48"/>matchleſs impudence of your addreſs, I am equally inclined to love and to deſpiſe you. That you could die a martyr for me, with as much chearfulneſs as thouſands have done for their religion, I can by no means believe; for, in the next world, I have neither a houſe, nor a tree, that I can call my own; and, were ſuch a tragi-comical event to take place, I much queſtion whether I ſhould have the ſmalleſt reaſon to wiſh it otherwiſe. This declaration, Sir, may ſurprize you: but you will ceaſe to wonder, when I tell you, that I have no very favourable opinion of a ſoldier. My laſt huſband was an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in the army, young, handſome, intelligent, and bleſt with every requiſite, ſave one, to render me perfectly happy.—"Save one!" you will reply; "What could that be?"—CONSTANCY, Sir; the baſis of felicity in a conjugal ſtate. He loved the women indiſcriminately; me, apparently, more than the reſt, becauſe it was more to his intereſt. My per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal property became his the moment we were married; but my real eſtate, with which you are ſo much enamoured, he could not touch without my conſent. This kept him in good humour; for he well knew, that if he diſpleaſed me, I ſhould at my deceaſe bequeath the whole to a poor relation, and leave him the pill of diſappointment, to carry off the dregs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence. Thus happily fortified againſt the tyranny of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſpoſition, I lived in tolerable eaſe with him for the ſpace of three years; when a lingering intermittent brought on a conſumption, which ſoon cloſed the career of his life, and made me an inheritor of liberty at large. This ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of my fate, from ſubjection to freedom, was the grand deſideratum of my wiſhes; and, as I have known a depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of liberty, I ſhall now ſet the higher value on that ineſtimable bleſſing. Inſtead, therefore, of giving you the encouragement you ſolicit, I muſt tell you frankly, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known the joys of matrimony, as well as it's inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, I am not inclined to purchaſe a moment's pleaſure with an age of pain. I am now my own miſtreſs; ſubject to no controul; and above the cenſure of the impertinent. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be your opinion of me, after the peruſal of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be aſſured it is not in your power, however ſpecious your arguments, or captivating your perſon may be, to diſturb for one moment the tranquillity of her who, having known the duplicity and inconſtancy of one, will never entruſt to another that happineſs which ſhe now finds in her own boſom. I am, Sir, with as much ſincerity, your lover, as I wiſh you to be mine.</p>

                  <head>SIR SIMON AND HODGE; OR, THE ADDITIONAL WRINKLE.</head>
                  <byline>BY MR. HARRISON.</byline>
                  <l>AS Hodge, one day, was ſwelt'ring in the ſun,</l>
                  <l>A dry old dog, yet a true child of fun;</l>
                  <l>Sir Simon came, to ſee his man ſo blithe,</l>
                  <l>Panting beneath the labour of his ſcythe:</l>
                  <l>For Hodge had riſen ere the early dawn,</l>
                  <l>'Twas now high noon, nor yet clean ſhav'd the lawn.</l>
                  <l>Much had he done, which he was pleas'd to view,</l>
                  <l>But curs'd the little that remain'd to do.</l>
                  <l>His arms were weary, and his aged back</l>
                  <l>Seem'd ev'ry ſinew, at each bend, to crack;</l>
                  <l>At ev'ry ſtroke, the drops of ſweat faſt pace</l>
                  <l>Down the rough furrows of his time-plough'd face.</l>
                  <l>And ſtill he ſtops, though he can ſcarcely ſtand,</l>
                  <l>To ſweep his dewy forehead with his hand;</l>
                  <l>With frequent rubbings whets his ling'ring blade,</l>
                  <l>And ſighs for ev'ning, and the freſh'ning ſhade.</l>
                  <l>Now old Sir Simon was as queer a ſoul,</l>
                  <l>As Hodge himſelf, but nothing like ſo droll:</l>
                  <l>He had ſome wit, and thought that he had more,</l>
                  <l>As many a greater wit has done before;</l>
                  <l>And many another, we may well maintain,</l>
                  <l>Has done ſo ſince, and will do ſo again.</l>
                  <l>"Hodge," ſays Sir Simon, "you can't well be dry,</l>
                  <l>For you are wet enough, I ſee, to fry;</l>
                  <l>Now had you been but dry enough to burn,</l>
                  <l>A jug of ale had done you no ill-turn!"</l>
                  <l>Hodge ſmil'd at very mention of the nappy;</l>
                  <l>But, at the ſight, was wondrouſly more happy:</l>
                  <l>For now Sir Simon, having had his joke,</l>
                  <l>Drew the full pitcher from beneath his cloak.</l>
                  <l>Hodge ſeiz'd, with eager hand, the foaming prize;</l>
                  <l>And, heav'n-ward raiſing both his grateful eyes,</l>
                  <l>Faſt down his throat the welcome liquor pours,</l>
                  <l>Nor heeds his maſter, loudly though he roars—</l>
                  <l>"Stop, Hodge! why, Hodge; zounds! Hodge, why don't you ſtop?</l>
                  <l>I'm thirſty too; zounds! Hodge, leave me a drop!"</l>
                  <l>Sir Simon bawl'd as loud as he could bawl,</l>
                  <l>But Hodge ne'er ſtopp'd, till he had ſwallow'd all.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0906500201:50"/>As flowly, now, he panting gains his breath,</l>
                  <l>That ſeem'd awhile o'ermatch'd by ſtruggling death—</l>
                  <l>"Hodge," ſays Sir Simon, "pry'thee canſt not hear?</l>
                  <l>Why, zounds! I bade thee not drink all the beer!</l>
                  <l>Deuce take thy throat, mine's hoarſe with ſo much bawl;</l>
                  <l>I've half a mind to ram down jug and all.</l>
                  <l>I told thee I was dry as well as thee;</l>
                  <l>But not a drop, plague take thee, 's left for me!"</l>
                  <l>Hodge now affected wonderful ſurprize,</l>
                  <l>And like a pig's juſt ſtuck appear'd his eyes—</l>
                  <l>"Lord, Sir," ſays Hodge, ſeemingly vaſt contrite,</l>
                  <l>Though bent by trick to pacify the knight—</l>
                  <l>"Iſe be main ſorry thus to give offence;</l>
                  <l>But, to a perſon of your worſhip's ſenſe,</l>
                  <l>Iſe need not ſay, for that would be abſurd,</l>
                  <l>While a man drinks he ne'er can hear one word."—</l>
                  <l>"Not hear while drinking?" ſtraight Sir Simon cries,</l>
                  <l>Fill'd, in his turn, with a ſtuck pig's ſurprize;</l>
                  <l>"Why, ſure—why, ſure, Hodge—that can never be!</l>
                  <l>Egad, I'll fetch another jug, and ſee."</l>
                  <l>Away the knight, with his beſt ſpeed, then went,</l>
                  <l>To find the truth, as told by Hodge, intent;</l>
                  <l>And Hodge, mean time, contriv'd the means to make</l>
                  <l>Sir Simon, what he ſaid, for Goſpel take.</l>
                  <l>"Now, Hodge," the knight, returning, cried, "we'll try</l>
                  <l>If what you tell me truth be, or a lye.</l>
                  <l>I'll drink, and you muſt bellow—"Stop, ſtop, ſtop!</l>
                  <l>Do, pray, Sir," you may add, "leave me a drop."</l>
                  <l>This, when I hear, I certainly will do;</l>
                  <l>So, as I drink, remember, Hodge, bawl you."</l>
                  <l>Sir Simon heav'd the pitcher to his head;</l>
                  <l>Hodge op'd his mouth, but not a word he ſaid:</l>
                  <l>Yet gap'd ſo wide, there ſeem'd abundant fear</l>
                  <l>The fellow meant to tear from ear to ear.</l>
                  <l>"This truth, ſo ſtrange," to Hodge Sir Simon cried,</l>
                  <l>"I ne'er would have believ'd, had I not tried.</l>
                  <l>Thus, Hodge, it is, though life wears faſt away,</l>
                  <l>Wiſer and wiſer, we grow ev'ry day!</l>
                  <l>This time thou hadſt, I fairly own, moſt brains,</l>
                  <l>So freely take the liquor for thy pains."</l>
                  <l>Hodge thus got paid for playing off his wit;</l>
                  <l>And pleas'd his maſter was, though he was bit:</l>
                  <l>Convine'd that he had gain'd a wrinkle more,</l>
                  <l>No matter where—than e'er he had before.</l>

                     <l>A Fellow in a market fown,</l>
                     <l>Moſt muſical cried razors up and down,</l>
                     <l>And offer'd twelve for eighteen pence;</l>
                     <l>Which certainly ſeem'd wondrous cheap,</l>
                     <l>And for the money quite a heap,</l>
                     <l>As ev'ry man would buy with caſh and ſenſe.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>A country bumpkin the great offer heard:</l>
                     <l>Poor Hodge, who ſuffer'd by a broad black beard,</l>
                     <l>That ſeem'd a ſhoe-bruſh ſtuck beneath his noſe;</l>
                     <l>With chearfulneſs the eighteen-pence he paid,</l>
                     <l>And proudly to himſelf, in whiſpers ſaid—</l>

                     <l>It certainly will be a monſtrous prize!"</l>
                     <l>So home the clown, with his good fortune, went,</l>
                     <l>Smiling in heart and ſoul content,</l>

                  <head>PLATE III. THE IDLE 'PRENTICE AT PLAY IN THE CHURCH-YARD DURING DIVINE SERVICE.</head>
                  <p>IN this admirable Print, a fine contraſt is afforded to the preceding one. Here, while the virtuous and induſtrious youth is performing the duty of a pious Chriſtian, his indolent and vicious fellow-apprentice lies ſtretched on a tomb-ſtone, and gambling with the vileſt aſſociates. They are playing at huſtle-cap; and Tom Idle is in the act of cheating, by a concealment of ſome of the half pence under the broad brim of his hat.</p>
                  <p>A Shoe-black, diſtinguiſhed by his ſtool, baſket, and bruſhes, challenges the fraud; and their proſligate Companion, with a black patch over his eye, is reſolutely inſiſting on fair play.</p>
                  <p>So deeply are they engaged in the diſpute, that the Beadle, ſummoned by the noiſe of their quarrel, approaches unperceived to chaſtiſe them with his cane. The firſt intimation of the Beadle's preſence is obviouſly ſignified by a ſmart application of the rattan on the culprit's back.</p>
                  <p>That the filthieſt and moſt ſlothful wretches are under the neceſſity of continually employing their hands, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly, is manifeſt in the active ſearch of the Shoe-black beneath his rags, as well as the ſimilar diligence of the Lad with his hat ſcratched more than half off his head, who are both evidently infeſted by an enemy that compels them to be buſy with their ſingers.</p>

HERE LIES THE BODY OF —, is inſcribed, with the peculiar felicity of Hogarth, on the tomb where lazy Tom is ſeen ſtretched at full-length.</p>
                  <p>The ſkulls and other bones near the open grave, are not only characteriſtick of the ſcene, but ſerve to increaſe, as it were, the turpitude of the offenders, by diſplaying their hardened and abominable inſenſibility to objects which cannot be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed without a degree of aweful horror by all who poſſeſs the common feelings of humanity.</p>
                  <p>The fatality of aſſociating with ſuch miſcreants will be abundantly demonſtrated in the ſucceeding ſeries; where the fellow with a black patch over one eye, firſt encountered at a ſort of gaming-table in a church-yard, leads Tom Idle, a not unwilling votary, into the depths of iniquity, and then, like the arch-betrayer of mankind, compleatly abandons him.</p>
                  <p>The motto is literally appropriate to the ſcene—</p>

                  <p>AS I was a few days ago croſſing Moorfields, I perceived a large crowd of people gathered together, making a noiſe to the full as confuſed, and generally ſpeaking to the full as unintelligible, as could poſſibly be heard at the famous building of the Tower of Babel.</p>
                  <p>I am naturally averſe to ſuch aſſemblies: but, as I was at a loſs to know with certainty from what cauſe it originated, curioſity prompted me to viſit the ſcene of action; where I beheld one of the moſt ſtubborn battles, between a coalheaver and a carman, that perhaps ever was ſeen, at the trifling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a tolerable handkerchief, and an old memorandum-book of no uſe to any one but the right-owner.</p>
                  <p>What ſtruck me moſt forcibly, during this conflict, was the jargon which flew about on the occaſion; and in which, as the company probably conſiſted of almoſt every different ſpecies of artificers and labourers, I thought I could diſcover ſtriking traits of their reſpective profeſſions.</p>
                  <p>If the reader poſſeſſes himſelf of the ſame idea, he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably peruſe the following minutes of ſuch parts of the collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy as I could diſtinguiſh, with a ſatisfaction nearly equal to that which I myſelf felt.</p>

                  <head>ADDRESS TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.</head>
                  <p>AND really a good ſort of people ye are, when ye are pleaſed. The taſk is not difficult to bring ye into good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour, neither; but I defy all the artiſts in Europe to keep you ſo.</p>
                  <p>Ye love to find fault; nay, to make faults: and, if you cannot quarrel with your neighbours, you will fall out with yourſelves; like the greyhound, who uſed to grow angry at his own tail.</p>
                  <p>You may ſay that I am guilty of injuſtice; and that ye are affable, humane, friendly, charitable, ſocial, ſweet-tempered,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0906500201:61"/>ſelf-denying, beings: if every perſon was to draw his own picture, the pen-and-ink portrait would appear ſo; but I, who have looked upon life for above twenty years, as an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſpectator of all the fantaſticalneſs with which mankind have fatigued themſelves—to me ye appear ſelfiſh, ſtubborn, querulous, conceited, diſcontented, exiſtences; and ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more than ye deſerve, yet are daily wiſhing for more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and to do leſs to deſerve them.</p>
                  <p>I dined yeſterday at Mr. Fineer's; and his eldeſt ſon being introduced, according to the ancient family cuſtom of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the viſitors how much wit the heir has, one of the gueſts addreſſed his papa with—"I ſuppoſe, Sir, you will bring maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter up to your buſineſs."—"Bring him up to be a hangman, rather!" was the parent's anſwer. "No, no; he ſhall never be brought up to work all his life-time for nothing, as I have done." And yet this perſon has gained, by his own induſtry and ſucceſs in trade, upwards of four thouſand pounds. But thus it is; we covet to enjoy ſtill more than we do, and want ſtill to do leſs for it.</p>
                  <p>Epictetus ſays, mankind are diſſatisfied; Senecca ſays, they are diſcontented: and this is what, both before and ſince Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, every perſon has been ſaying, who could ſay any thing.</p>
                  <p>With your leave, good people, I ſhall preſent you with a couple of characters: as it is common for thoſe who ſuppoſe themſelves to be artiſts, to exhibit ſpecimens of their perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, I offer theſe with ſubmiſſion; and tell me, if you pleaſe, how you like them.</p>
                  <p>They are ſketches of a Farmer and a Hop-planter.</p>
                  <p>In the harveſt ſeaſon, that particular month of Providence's bounty, when all the animal creation appears chearfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, and we may even fancy approaching Winter to bear a ſmile on his weather-worn wrinkles, when he views the ſtore that is gathering in to comfort him while he viſits us; yet, even then, congratulate the Farmer on the noble proſpect of his well-covered acres, he will ſhake his head; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſigh and a grunt, he will anſwer you with—"Ah, but the ſtraw is ſhort!"</p>
                  <p>If the ſtraw is long, then he will tell you there is no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the grain.</p>
                  <p>If there is but an indifferent crop, he laments that it will not pay the expence of houſing and threſhing.</p>
                  <p>If a plentiful crop, then he grumbles, corn will be ſo cheap, it will not be worth carrying to market.</p>
                  <p>Juſt ſo the Hop-planter: he riſes, lifts up the ſaſh, and looks over the horizon; if the morning happens to be cloudy, he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0906500201:62"/>pulls down the window with an oath, ſaying—"It will rain to-day, and all the bloſſoms will be waſhed off!"</p>
                  <p>If there ſhould be a pleaſant air abroad, then the poles will be all blown down.</p>
                  <p>If the ſun ſhines, "O Lord! the plants will be burned up."</p>
                  <p>If it is a cloſe, dry day, without much ſunſhine, or wind, then he wiſhes for rain to deſtroy the vermin, or elſe they will eat all the buds up.</p>
                  <p>The reader, who neither owns hop-grounds, nor rents corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, will wonder how theſe perſons can be ſo diſcontented. Yet it is an even bett, that thoſe who ſeem to be amazed at ſuch grumblers, are as diſſatisfied themſelves: the ſymptoms of the diſtemper may be different, but the diſeaſe is the ſame in almoſt all.</p>
                  <p>Half the cure is ſuppoſed to be performed when the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian knows, the patient's diſorder. Indeed, my good people, neighbours, countrymen, and choice ſpirits, I do know, bonâ fide, that you are diſordered, and know that you diſorder is; nay, would preſcribe for you, but imagine my medicines will be thrown away.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe I order you a few grains of ſelf-knowledge, half a drachm of patience, and a ſcruple of ſelf-denial, mixed up with a tea-ſpoonful of the ſyrup of humanity, will any of you take ſuch an electuary? Ye might taſte it, indeed, for the novelty's ſake; but I will bett a handful of integrity, againſt all court ceremonies, that ye ſpit it out again.</p>
                  <p>Folly has thrown your heads into hyſtericks; and I will ſay opinion againſt common-ſenſe, which are the greateſt odds that can be offered, not one man in many dozens knows what is the matter with himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Laſt week I called on an old acquaintance: his lady told me her ſpouſe was diſturbed and diſordered at ſomething, ſhe could not tell for what; and that ſhe was happy at my calling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe hoped I would get him into ſpirits again.</p>
                  <p>I went to him into his ſtudy; there he ſat, diſcontented as an undone gameſter. I took him by the hand, and enquired if he was ill. He replied that, thank God, he enjoyed as good a ſtate of health as any man in the world. I deſired to know if his affairs were any way complicated, which might make him uneaſy. His reply was—"Sir, I do not owe any perſon a ſhilling; and my income greatly exceeds my out-ſets."— "I hope, Sir, no words have happened betwixt your lady and you?"—"There is not a better woman breathing, Sir; and we live in continued harmony."—"How does your daughter, Sir?"—"Married, Sir, and as happy as I am."—"Your ſon at college?"—"My ſon, Sir, contributes to my happineſs; I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0906500201:63"/>hear every body praiſe him."—"What then, Sir, can you be uneaſy about?"—"See there, Sir!" my friend replied, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his voice at the ſame time, and pulling ſome printed papers out of his pocket. "There, Sir! read there! There is the Gazetteer, and the General, and the Ledger, and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, and the Chronicle, and the Morning Poſt. Who can enjoy themſelves when we read ſuch terrible accounts as they give us; not only of the government, but alſo of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Mercy upon us! but we are a bought-and-ſold nation!"</p>
                  <p>With ſome difficulty I perſuaded him to come into company again, and once more be himſelf; and leave the ſtudy of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks alone to thoſe who loved to be impoſed on.</p>
                  <p>I told him, all that a man of ſenſe ought to do, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the laws of God and his country; to take things as they were; uſe them as they ſhould be; act with as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity to mankind as the cuſtoms of the world would ſuffer; and, independent and contented, enjoy the pleaſures of domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſociety, and wait with patience for that awful, that all-intereſting event, when empire breaks his ſceptre, and beauty ceaſes to be amiable, when faction is diſſipated, the phantom of pride vaniſhed, and all the worldly diſtinctions are buried in a death-bed diſſolution.</p>

                  <head>CHARACTER OF A. HARE, ESQ. A VERY EXTRAORDINARY COUNTRY GENTLEMAN.</head>
                  <p>PERMIT this letter to inform you, that there is coming up to town by the Norwich coach, one who has lived moſt part of his time in our neighbourhood; if, indeed, he is not a native of this county: but of that I cannot be poſitive, neither is it very material, as I can, notwithſtanding, give you a ſufficient account of him for your conduct reſpecting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and treatment which it will be proper to give him, having furniſhed him — for he never was in town before—with a direction to your houſe. His conduct in time paſt has been, though not totally irreprehenſible, as innocent, at leaſt, as that of moſt others. Some few complaints I have heard of his depredations in the gardens, if not in the orchards, of his neighbours; but yet they have been ready to acknowledge, at the ſame time, they believe he thought no harm. It is true, he was rather wild in his youth, but never extravagant or gay in dreſs. Living wholly in the country, he has no notion of the amuſements of the town; but, being remarkably light of foot, has not been able entirely to abſent himſelf from field di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0906500201:64"/>nor yet has he indulged himſelf in them. Upon ſuch occaſions he has been much ſought; and, when he has been only juſt ſeen, or, as it were, had in view, it is ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the reſt of the company have exulted; and much has been, in the words of the poet, on other joyous occaſions, "the clamour of men, of boys, and dogs." But, though every body elſe has appeared highly delighted, I have reaſon to believe he never enjoyed peace of mind at ſuch riotous doings; for he has always endeavoured to leave them as ſoon as he could, and ſometimes he has ſtolen away, and left them at a fault for want of his company. But how forcible is unprofitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany! At other times, a more ſelect party have compelled him to take the lead, and go greater lengths than he approved: which has ſtill been attended with uneaſineſs of mind, and frequently has he been turned: but lately, on an occaſion of that ſort, he received ſo ſevere a check in the midſt of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, that it entirely put a ſtop to his progreſs in that way; and, to tell you the truth, is the cauſe of his leaving the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at this time. Though much altered in that reſpect, I believe he is ſtill what may be called hare-brained, which I ſuppoſe you will diſcover before he has been long in your company. Unaccuſtomed to being frequently in much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as well as naturally timid and ſhy, even in the country, it is not to be expected he will ever be capable of entertaining a very large company; but a few ſelect friends, I believe, will be very well ſatisfied with what they can obtain from him, or pick out of him. And, let me tell you, however unlikely it may ſeem, he will bear a roaſting as well as moſt; only take this information along with you, as he is a mere ruſtick, and has indulged his appetite in the country without ſcruple, though with ſtrict temperance, it may not be amiſs to fill his belly with pudding, and perhaps a glaſs of wine may not be ill-beſtowed, before you try that experiment upon him. Of the family of the Hares you have doubtleſs heard. I have ſome notion, one of them attained to conſiderable dignity in the national church; but the ſubject of this letter, though of the ſame name, is not of that family, but of one more ancient; nor did ever one of theſe profeſs with them: not but that I lately read an account in the newſpapers of one of this family, who went to a place of publick worſhip in time of ſervice, but I believe with no more devotion than ſome others whom I have heard called Thorough Churchmen, from their going, as it is moſt likely he did, in at one door and out at the other. Though this family cannot boaſt of places or penſions from the court, they have not been totally diſregarded by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0906500201:65"/>The nobility and gentry having put it out of the power, as far as acts of parliament, with united aſſociations to enforce them, can do it, of the ſmall vulgar, to exerciſe their mercileſs tempers upon them; as they were too apt to do, if they could only extort from them a meal's meat by it, and ſometimes merely for the diverſion of following them from place to place: and yet, I believe, if they were to ſpeak all the truth, we ſhould find themſelves more frequently injured, and more wantonly perſecuted, by their profeſſed protectors, than any other men; and, may I not add, perhaps they are not alone in that predicament. But, as this letter is not intended to be a vehicle for political or diſaffected reflections on men and meaſures, I ſhall conclude with wiſhing the ſubject of it may arrive ſafe at your houſe, and give your wife and your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as much ſatisfaction as it gives me pleaſure to have ſuch an opportunity of ſubſcribing myſelf,</p>

                  <head>SPECIMEN OF BEAU NASH'S MANNER OF TELLING A STORY.</head>
                  <p>I Will tell you ſomething to that purpoſe—that, I fancy, will make you laugh. A covetous old parſon, as rich as the devil, ſcraped a freſh acquaintance with me ſeveral years ago at Bath. I knew him when he and I were ſtudents at Oxford, where we both ſtudied damnationly hard; but that is neither here nor there. Well, very well. I entertained him at my houſe in John's Court—no, my houſe in John's Court was not built then—but I entertained him with all that the city could afford; the rooms, the muſick, and every thing in the 'world. On his leaving Bath, he preſſed me very bard to return the viſit; and deſired me to let him have the pleaſure of ſeeing me at his houſe in Devonſhire. About ſix months after, I happened to be in that neighbourhood; and was reſolved to ſee my old friend, from whom I expected a very warm reception. Well, I knocks at his door: when an old queer creature of a maid came to the door, and denied him. I ſuſpected, however, that he was at home; and, going into the parlour, what ſhould I ſee but the parſon's legs up the chimney, where he had thruſt himſelf to avoid entertaining me. This was very well. "My dear," ſays I to the maid, "it is very cold, extreme cold, indeed; and, I am afraid, I have got a touch of my ague: light me the fire, if you pleaſe."—"La, Sir!" ſays the maid, who was a modeſt creature, to be ſure, "the chimney ſmokes monſtrouſly; you would not bear the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0906500201:66"/>room for three minutes together." By the greateſt good luck there was a bundle of ſtraw on the hearth, and I called for a candle. The candle came. "Well, good woman," ſays I, "ſince you will not light me a fire, I will light one for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:" and in a moment the ſtraw was all in a blaze. This quickly unkennelled the old fox: there he ſtood in an old ruſty night-gown, bleſſing himſelf, and looking like—a—hem— egad!</p>
                  <p>Here I ſtand, gentlemen, who could once leap forty-two feet upon level ground, at three ſtanding-jumps, backward or forward: one, two, three—dart like an arrow out of a bow— but I am old now. I remember, I once leaped for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred guineas with Count Clopſtock, the great leaper, leaping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to the Prince of Paſſau: you muſt all have heard of him. Firſt he began with the running-jump; and a moſt damnable bounce it was, that is certain. Every body concluded that he had the match hollow: when, only taking off my hat, ſtripping off neither coat, ſhoes, nor ſtockings—mind me!—I fetches a run, and went beyond him one foot, three inches, and three quarters; meaſured, upon my ſoul! by Captain Pately's own ſtandard.</p>

                  <head>THE SPEAKING DOG. A PERSIAN STORY.</head>
                  <head type="sub">TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH.</head>
                  <p>A King of Perſia, who was in the ſixty-third year of his age, grew ſo doating fond of one of his concubines, a fair Circaſſian, named Roxana, that he obliged himſelf, by a ſolemn oath, never to refuſe her any thing ſhe ſhould requeſt of him. The lady made her advantage of this monarch's weakneſs; and every day, by ſome new and extravagant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, took occaſion to gratify her ambition, her avarice, or her revenge. During the career of her power, a certain Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean merchant, who had ſold her ſome jewels, in order to engage her intereſt and protection at court, made her a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a beautiful little dog, which had been taught to dance, and play a thouſand antick tricks. In a ſhort time, Roxana became as fond of her dog as the king was of her; only ſhe lamented, that the little creature was not endowed with ſpeech, and could not, therefore, make a proper reply to thoſe endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions ſhe uſed as often as ſhe careſſed him. One of her eunuchs then preſent, told her ſhe need not grieve on this account; for he knew a philoſopher, named Hali, then living in the ſuburbs of Iſpahan, who could teach her dog to ſpeak the Perſian language as articulately as he ſpoke it himſelf:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0906500201:67"/>that he had learned this art from a Grecian ſage, who had not only given ſpeech to dogs, and other animals of his country, but had rendered them as learned and knowing as thoſe great men among the ancients who had been bred in the ſchools of Athens. Hali was immediately ſent for, made acquainted with this buſineſs, and required to attend the next morning to give the dog his firſt leſſon. It was in vain for the poor man to remonſtrate againſt the poſſibility of ſuch an undertaking; he was anſwered, it was the king's command, and muſt not be diſputed: that, if he performed what was enjoined him in the ſpace of thirty days, he ſhould be amply rewarded; if he failed, he ſhould loſe his head.</p>
                  <p>Hali, we may imagine, conſidered the king's command as the artifice of his enemies, and as a trap which they had laid for his life. He communicated his diſtreſs to his eldeſt ſon, a youth of nineteen, who had a ready wit, and excellent parts, which had been well cultivated and improved by his wiſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's inſtructions. He had, beſides, a moſt engaging manner of addreſs, a great ſweetneſs of temper, and a beautiful perſon. Mirza—for that was the young man's name—burſt into tears when he heard the king's orders; but, immediately recovering himſelf, he told his father that he had thought of a certain method to divert the danger which threatened their family.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe he deſired Hali to preſent him the next morning to the chief eunuch as his daughter, and as a perſon well inſtructed in her father's art, and who would engage, at the hazard of her own life, as well as his; to execute the king's injunction, and thereby merit his grace and favour. Hali looked upon his ſon with amazement; and perſuading himſelf that he ſpoke by the inſpiration of the Prophet, who had taken their houſe under his protection, he made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of complying with young Mirza's requeſt.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, next morning, Mirza, diſguiſed in a virgin's habit, was conducted to the chief eunuch, and by him led into Roxana's apartment; where he performed his part ſo well, that, before the month expired, it was reported all over the ſeraglio, that the philoſopher's daughter had taught the little dog not only to ſpeak, but to ſpeak like a wiſe man, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer pertinently to every queſtion. The king would needs be aſſured of the truth of this prodigy. He made a viſit to his favourite; ſhe confirmed the report; and the dog being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, was commanded to give a proof of his ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The monarch ſeated himſelf on a ſopha; and, taking the dog in his arms, gently ſtroked his head—(and he ſtroked it,

After a ſhort ſilence, Roxana entreated the king to tell her if he was not highly delighted with the anſwer which the little beaſt had made him, and whether he could ever have believed the thing if he had not heard it. The king proteſted he had not heard a word; at which Roxana ſeemed much concerned; and, looking earneſtly in the king's face, demanded again, if his majeſty had not heard the dog anſwer him in the words following—"You are the ſon of the ſun, the lieutenant of the prophets, and the king of kings; you are dreaded by your enemies, adored by your ſubjects, and paſſionately beloved by my fair miſtreſs."</p>
                  <p>The King of Perſia roſe up amazed and confounded; but, ſtill inſiſting he did not hear the dog ſpeak, Roxana lifted up her hands, and thus addreſſed herſelf to Mahomet—"Thou meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of God, protect and defend the king; increaſe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, lengthen his life, preſerve his underſtanding, and open his ears; and, O never—never let him feel the infirmities of old age!" Then the dog being ordered to ſpeak a little louder, ſhe begged the king to make a ſecond trial, which he did with great ſucceſs; for he now declared he heard the little creature diſtinctly utter every word, juſt as Roxana had before repeated.</p>
                  <p>This occaſioned an univerſal joy in the ſeraglio. Nothing was talked of for ſome days but the ſpeaking dog. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the king was written in letters of gold, and preſerved in the archives of the empire. The pretended daughter of Hali was diſmiſſed with a noble reward, and her father was ſoon afterwards promoted to one of the beſt governments in Perſia.</p>

                  <p>Old age very ſeldom proves a bleſſing to great men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to theſe who have any ſhare in the government of the world. The Perſian monarch, who ruled ſo many nations, and eſteemed himſelf a favourite of the gods, and the firſt man in the univerſe, was not permitted the uſe of his eyes or his ears. He was the dupe of his ſlave, and the jeſt of his whole court; but no one durſt tell him ſo, and he died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it.</p>

                  <p>ONE Sunday during laſt ſummer, while the weather was extremely hot, the windows of a certain pariſh church in the dioceſe of Glouceſter were ſet open to admit more air, while the congregation was aſſembled for divine ſervice. Juſt as the clergyman was beginning his weekly diſcourſe—who, by the bye, is not much celebrated for his oratorial powers—a Jack-aſs, which had been grazing in the church-yard, popped his head in at the window, and began braying with all his might. as if in oppoſition to the reverend preacher. On this, a wag preſent, immediately got up from his ſeat; and, with great gravity of countenance, exclaimed—"One at a time, gentlemen, if you pleaſe!" The whole congregation ſet up a loud laugh; when the Jack-aſs took fright, and gave up the conteſt—though, from the clergyman's chagrin and confuſion, he would probably not have proved the worſt orator.</p>

                     <l>"To-morrow is our wedding-day,</l>
                     <l>And we will then repair</l>
                     <l>Unto the Bell at Edmonton,</l>
                     <l>All in a chaiſe and pair.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>"My ſiſter and my ſiſter's child,</l>
                     <l>Myſelf and children three,</l>
                     <l>Will fill the chaiſe; ſo you muſt ride</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>He ſoon replied—"I do admire</l>
                     <l>Of womankind but one;</l>
                     <l>And you are ſhe, my deareſt dear,</l>
                     <l>Therefore it ſhall be done.</l>

                     <l>"I am a linen-draper hold,</l>

                     <l>Will lend his horſe to go."</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Quoth Mrs. Gilpin—"That's well ſaid;</l>
                     <l>And, for that wine is dear,</l>
                     <l>We will be furniſh'd with our own,</l>
                     <l>Which is ſo bright and clear."</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>John Gilpin kiſs'd his loving wiſe;</l>
                     <l>O'erjoy'd was he to find,</l>
                     <l>That, though on pleaſure ſhe was bent,</l>
                     <l>She had a frugal mind.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>The morning came, the chaiſe was brought,</l>
                     <l>But yet was not allow'd</l>
                     <l>To drive up to the door, leſt all</l>
                     <l>Should ſay that ſhe was proud.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>So three doors off the chaiſe was ſtaid,</l>
                     <l>Where they did all get in,</l>
                     <l>Six precious ſouls, and all agog</l>
                     <l>To daſh through thick and thin.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,</l>
                     <l>Were never folks ſo glad;</l>
                     <l>The ſtones did rattle underneath,</l>
                     <l>As if Cheapſide were made.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>John Gilpin, at his horſe's ſide,</l>
                     <l>Seiz'd faſt the flowing mane,</l>
                     <l>And up he got in haſte to ride,</l>
                     <l>But ſoon came down again.</l>

                     <l>For ſaddle-tree ſcarce reach'd had he,</l>
                     <l>His journey to begin,</l>
                     <l>When, turning round his face, he ſaw</l>
                     <l>Three cuſtomers come in.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>So down he came; for loſs of time,</l>
                     <l>Although it griev'd him ſore,</l>
                     <l>Yet loſs of pence, full well he knew,</l>
                     <l>Would grieve him ten times more.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>'Twas long before the cuſtomers</l>
                     <l>Were ſuited to their mind,</l>
                     <l>When Betty ſcream'd into his cars—</l>
                     <l>"The wine is left behind!"</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Good lack!" quoth he; "yet bring it me,</l>
                     <l>My leathern belt likewiſe,</l>
                     <l>In which I bear my truſty ſword</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Now Miſtreſs Gilpin—careful ſoul!—</l>
                     <l>Had two ſtone-bottles found,</l>
                     <l>To hold the liquor which ſhe lov'd,</l>
                     <l>And keep it ſafe and ſound.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Each bottle had two curling cars,</l>
                     <l>Through which the belt he drew;</l>
                     <l>He hung one bottle on each ſide,</l>
                     <l>To make his balance true.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Then over all, that he might be</l>
                     <l>Equipp'd from top to too,</l>
                     <l>His long red cloak, well-bruſh'd and neat,</l>
                     <l>He manfully did throw.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Now ſee him mounted once again</l>
                     <l>Upon his nimble ſteed;</l>
                     <l>Full ſlowly pacing o'er the ſtones,</l>
                     <l>With caution and good heed.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>But finding ſoon a ſmoother road</l>

                     <l>The ſnorting beaſt began to trot,</l>
                     <l>Which gall'd him in his ſeat.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>"So! fair and ſoftly," John did cry,</l>
                     <l>But John he cried in vain;</l>
                     <l>That trot became a gallop ſoon,</l>

                     <l>Who cannot ſit upright,</l>
                     <l>He graſp'd the mane with both his hands,</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Away went Gilpin, neek or nought,</l>

                     <l>He little dreamt, when he ſet out,</l>

                     <l>The horſe, who never had before</l>

                     <l>Affrighted fled; and, as he flew,</l>
                     <l>Left all the world behind.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>The wind did blow, the cloak did ſly,</l>
                     <l>Like ſtreamer long and gay;</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>The dogs did bark, the children ſcream'd,</l>
                     <l>Up flew the windows all;</l>
                     <l>And ev'ry ſoul cried out—"Well done!"</l>
                     <l>As loud as he could bawl.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Away went Gilpin—who but he!</l>
                     <l>His fame ſoon ſpread around—</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>And ſtill, as faſt as he drew near,</l>
                     <l>'Twas wonderful to view,</l>

                     <l>And now, as he went bowing down</l>
                     <l>His reeking head full low,</l>
                     <l>The bottles twain, behind his back,</l>

                     <l>Juſt like unto a trundling-mop,</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>At Edmonton his loving wife</l>

                     <l>They all at once did cry;</l>
                     <l>"The dinner waits, and we are tired!"—</l>
                     <l>Said Gilpin—"So am I!"</l>

                  <lg>

                  <lg>
                     <l>So like an arrow ſwift he flew</l>
                     <l>Shot by an archer ſtrong;</l>
                     <l>So did he fly—which brings me to</l>

                  <p>THIS Print exhibits the conſequence reſulting from the practice of virtue and piety, in the confidence and eſteem which it naturally inſpires.</p>
                  <p>While Tom Idle's depravity leads him to become the profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate aſſociate of abject and vicious wretches, who prepare his mind for the commiſſion of higher crimes; the virtuous incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his fellow-apprentice, Francis Goodchild, introduce him to the confidential friendſhip of his reſpectable maſter, and lead him onward to opulence and fame. He appears, in this Print, as preſiding over the counting-houſe, and entruſted with the management of the entire buſineſs. The day-book is in his hands; the purſe and keys are committed to his care; and the amiable familiarity with which his maſter leans on his ſhoulder, bearing a placid ſmile on his intelligent countenance, demonſtrates the entire ſatisfaction with which he confides in this favourite youth, whoſe aſpect and attitude ſpeak equally his evident deſert. The union of the gloves, though laying as by accident, are finely figurative of the exiſting friendſhip, and point to the future partnerſhip of the parties; while the emblematical head-piece on the top of the London Almanack, ingeniouſly preſents, under the form of an ANGEL, the Induſtrious Youth <hi>taking</hi> TIME <hi>by the Forelock.</hi>

The groteſque phyſiognomy of this Porter with a Bardolphian noſe, and the ghaſtly grin of his four-footed attendant, in momentary dread of the cat, who is plainly collecting all her energies, in the elevated contour of her back, to deſend her domeſtick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and drive away the unwelcome invader of her conceived rights, are admirably depicted, and form a pleaſing contraſt to the amiable ſimplicity which pervades the reſt of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>

                  <p>In Spitalfields, for example, a few years ago, till every por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's knot began to cover a pig-tail, when any perſon of tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable decency happened to paſs through one of the many popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtreets of that diſtrict with his hair queued, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by myriads of men, women, and children, ſwarming at the doors and windows, with—"Look at his tail!"—"Only ſee there!"—"La, what a tail our cat has got!"—"Well, I wiſh I had but a tail!"—and a hundred ſuch ſpeeches; till he happily got into the ſomewhat more civilized regions of Whitechapel, Shoreditch, or Bethnal Green, where he was only liable to occaſional attacks from ſtragglers: the poor thoughtleſs wretches never once conſidering, that they ſhould perhaps the next day be obliged to quit their habitations, and ſolicit charity from the perſon they were then inſulting, for want of that very employ, which the faſhion they thus rudely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged was in ſome meaſure calculated to promote; with the additional diſadvantage of having ſteeled one, who might otherwiſe have felt for their diſtreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0906500201:86"/>that quarter, and which muſt ſtill be green in his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                  <p>Chairmen, Hackney-coachmen, and Watermen, have alſo a large ſhare of this diſpoſition, though they all owe much of their ſupport to cauſes which could not exiſt without dreſs, the neceſſary concomitant of viſits and parties of pleaſure: and, with reſpect to the laſt claſs of beings, in particular, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible, at preſent, for any well-dreſſed perſon to walk on the ſouthern banks of the Thames, or on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſhore highter than London Bridge, without many ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in what is emphatically ſtiled Water Language, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged in the neighbouring univerſity of Billingſgate. Indeed, from that famous ſeminary, abuſe is ſo plentifully diſſeminated among all the ſtall-keepers and baſket-carriers in our markets and publick ſtreets, and their reſpective connections, that it bids fair for becoming, what philoſophers have long wanted, a univerſal dialect: nor can this univerſality be at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, by thoſe who conſider that the venders of ſprats, oyſters, and other fiſh, in the winter—the ſeaſon when they take their academical degrees—are retailers of ſtrawberries, cherries, gooſeberries, cucumbers, cabbages, and other fruits and vegetables, in the ſummer; and that they carry all their original learning, vaſtly improved by practice, into every new proſeſſion, which is more than can be ſaid of many profeſſors in other arts and ſciences.</p>
                  <p>But though the ſeveral reſpectable perſonages included in the claſſes juſt mentioned, have powers of ſpeech at leaſt equal to thoſe of any other callings or profeſſions whatever, calculated to expreſs their antipa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0906500201:87"/>in the exerciſe of their reſpective vocations, any ſimilar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender who happens to be paſſing by them; the one by making his horſes ſuddenly plunge in a full kenned, and the other by a dextrous manoeuvre with his oars. But theſe contrivances, excellent as they all undoubtedly are, and highly to the credit of the ſeveral ingenious inventors, as well as to the excellent police which encourages, by not diſcouraging, ſuch laudable endeavours to increaſe the conſumption of our manufactures, are of little or no conſequence, when compared with the very ſuperior exertions of lamplighters, link-boys, chimney-ſweepers, ſcavengers, duſt-men, butchers, porters, and a variety of others; who are armed at all points to burn, oil, black, cover with mud, blind, bruiſe, and maim: ſo that all genteel perſons, who never fail to excite their attention, may eſteem themſelves extremely fortunate, if they walk in the publick ſtreets for ten minutes without meeting with ſome accident, as it is called, either in perſon or dreſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſucceſs of theſe gentry, in what ſeems to have become a part of their pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>et with univerſal approbation from the ſurrounding ſpectators, who cordially join in the laugh which practices of this kind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly inſpire; not always conſidering at whoſe expence ſome future mirth of the ſame kind may chance to be furniſhed. So natural is it for man to enjoy the preſent; without any retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the paſt, or much concern about the future.</p>
                  <p>A circumſtance, however, ſome time ſince came to my knowledge—for I was, unfortunately, not a ſpectator of the tranſaction—where a very laudable deſign of this nature was not taken in ſuch good part as uſual, by the perſon on whom the intended favour was conferred. To ſay the truth, the gentleman, who turned out the hero in the buſineſs to which I allude, appears to have been rather too converſant in certain arts of the vulgar; though few, I apprehend, will greatly blame his conduct on the preſent occaſion, when they have heard the whole ſtory, which I ſhall now endeavour to relate.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman from the Weſt-end of the town, who not only approved of putting on clean ſtockings, but who was deſirous to preſerve them ſo as much as poſſible while they were on, was one dirty day haſtening to his banker's, in Cornhill, with a very conſiderable ſum in his pockets. At the north-eaſt corner of St. Paul's Church Yard, exactly in the croſſing to Cheapſide, ſtood a ſeavenger's cart, attended by three or four begrimed myrmidons, who had wilfully blocked up the way, and waited the approach of a fit object for their mirth. The gentleman's white ſilk ſtockings, and his evident caution in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0906500201:88"/>walking, inſtantly attracted their notice: they accordingly ſet him down as a proper inſtrument, and made the uſual diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to receive him; ſpreading a large bed of mud acroſs the way, and wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing his approach with their ſcoops and beſoms; while one went forward to the horſes, that he might either ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k them, or make them ſpring forward among the filth, as occaſion ſerved, ſo as to produce the moſt miſchievous effect. A ſingle haſtly glance of the gentleman's eye, however, ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him what they meant to be at; and, in order to avoid them he kept to the left, intending to croſs by the end of Newgate—formerly called Blowbladder—Street. But the game was in view, and they reſolved not to loſe their ſport: one of the fellows, therefore, running round the cart, where he had clearly no other buſineſs, met the gentleman as he paſſed the top of Paternoſter Row; and fixed the dirty ſcoop with ſo much adroitneſs, that it not only made an ample ſpot on his ſtooking, but very nearly threw him down. It was with the utmoſt difficulty that the gentleman's ſpirit enabled him to bear for a moment this inſolent attack: but he wiſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that he had more property about him than he ſhould chuſe to loſe; that he had but a little way to go; and, that it would be impoſſible for them to have finiſhed, had they been more diſpoſed to work than they evidently were, before he ſhould return. He therefore haſtened on, without appearing to regard the univerſal roar of laughter againſt him; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpatched his buſineſs, was back in about twenty minutes, at one trunk-maker's, the corner of St. Paul's, froin whence he was about to croſs by the other's. The fellow, who had before met with ſuch ſucceſs and applauſe, had obſerved him returning, and was reſolved to have a ſtroke at the other ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He accordingly placed himſelf at the edge of the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with his back towards Cheapſide; ready to turn round the inſtant the gentleman ſhould come up, with ſuch an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the muddy implement in his hand as could not well fail effectually to do the buſineſs. Thus ſtationed, his grim features wore the aſpect of vaſt ſelf-complacency, and thoſe of his companions grinned their approbation. The gentleman had expected ſome ſimilar arrangement; and, having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on the part which it would be proper for him to act, took no pains to avoid the aſſailant, but went fairly into his clutches. The fellow, however, had very little time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate himſelf on the good effect of his ſtratagem: for the gentleman, being fully prepared, inſtantly faſtened on his collar, and with a ſingle blow felled him to the earth. The others now came round; and, with the ulmoſt liberality—of abuſe, were about to convince him that four men are more than a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0906500201:89"/>match for one: but the temporary ſtoppage had in the mean time formed a crowd; and, ſeveral perſons of genteel appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance being among them, the gentleman addreſſed himſelf to one in particular, and entreated him to depoſit his hat, coat, and watch, at the trunk-maker's, and to ſee that he had no foul play, as he had determined to fight the blackguard who had inſulted him in his own way. This propoſal gave univerſal ſatisfaction: for even the aggreſſor himſelf, little as he reliſhed the ſpecimen he had received from his antagoniſt, entertained no ſort of doubt that his own ſuperior ſtrength and ſkill, joined to a pretty extenſive practice, would ſoon enable him to repay with intereſt the blow under which he ſtill ſmarted; and, at any rate, it was no ſmall honour to box with a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man —while, on the contrary, any thing like a refuſal to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch a challenge would brand him with all the infamy of an eternal imputation of cowardice among his companions; nor, perhaps, after all, ſave him from a drubbing fully equal to what he ſhould receive in fair fighting. Which of theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons operated moſt powerfully, or whether all of them acted in concert, it is not by any means eaſy to decide: however, he loſt no time, in what bear-garden phraſeology denominates <hi>pecling,</hi> and in a few minutes he was quite <hi>uncaſed;</hi> in more refined language, ſtripped to the ſkin.</p>
                  <p>The ring was formed, and the combatants took their ſtations. The gentleman waited coolly to receive the fellow, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with great fury: but the former dextrouſly avoided a moſt tremendous blow; and, at the ſame inſtant, nimbly dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, gave his antagoniſt a moſt ſevere ſtroke under the ribs, which drove him breathleſs to the ground. He roſe again, and was again treated preciſely in the ſame manner, with the addition of a deep cut in his ſkull, received from a large ſtone on which he this ſecond time fell. He was now aſked if he had enough; and loud were the plaudits of the mob, in praiſe of the gentleman's proweſs, which all declared they had never ſeen exceeded. The fellow, however, was by no means ſatisfied; for he had not once ſtruck his antagoniſt, and he confided that a ſingle blow from his powerful arm could not fail to terminate the conteſt: that blow, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he determined in his own mind to give; and approached for this purpoſe with much caution, not forgetting to pay par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention to the protection of his own ribs, which had been twice ſo ſeverely handled exactly in the ſame place. The gentleman ſaw what was paſſing, and took his meaſures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: he was round the fellow in a moment; and, darting a blow, from which he inſtantaneouſly recoiled, hit him exactly between the eyes, with a violence which made them both
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0906500201:90"/>ſwell to an enormous ſize, and brought a torrent of blood from his noſtrils. He was now wild with anguiſh and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, though he could hardly ſtand—for the blow had made him ſtagger, though he was kept from quite falling—he ruſhed on with prodigious force and fury. But extreme paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had now thrown him quite off his guard; and another ſmart application to his ribs again beat him to the earth, from whence he appeared in no condition ſpeedily to ariſe without aſſiſtance. Indeed, it was for ſome time doubted that he would ever again recover. The gentleman, however, who had as much humanity as courage, deſired a ſurgeon might be ſent for before he quitted the ſpot; obſerving, that it was his wiſh only to cure, not to kill; the fellow who had want only inſulted him. The mob felt that the gentleman's heart was good; and, with their uſual attachment to what they think right, they idolized his generoſity, as well as his courage, and would almoſt to a man have now loſt their lives in his defence. What a pity that minds ſo well diſpoſed ſhould be ever miſled! what a pity that they do not always diſcover what is juſt! Had the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman been incapable of at firſt taking his own part, the very ſame perſons might have ſeen him treated with every indignity, and indeed cruelty, with the utmoſt unconcern; or even, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, with a thoughtleſs appearance of brutal ſatisfaction!</p>
                  <p>The poor wretch being at length ſufficiently recovered to ſtand on his legs, he begged to ſhake hands with the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and acknowledged he was ſorry that he had ill-treated a better man than himſelf. The tears guſhed from the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's eyes, at hearing this manly confeſſion: he gave the poor fellow his hand, and with it a guinea; telling his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, at the ſame time, that they all deſerved chaſtiſement, but that he hoped they would profit by what they had ſeen, without the experience of a ſimilar fate, which muſt doubtleſs ſome time or other attend all who purſue ſuch diſgraceful prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices. They then ſeverally proteſted that they were ſorry for what they had done: and, though they evidently did not deſerve any reward, he generouſly gave half a crown among them, which they declared they would ſpend in drinking his honour's health; and I dare venture to add, that they moſt religiouſly kept their word.</p>
                  <p>It happened, ſome time after, that the ſame gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man—whoſe extreme neatneſs was very apt to give the filthy ſuch offence as his ſize and appearance were not calculated to prevent them from reſenting in their way—was paſſing down Fiſh-Street Hill, when a tall chimney-ſweeper, with his two lads, literally bruſhed by him on each ſide, and ſoiled his coat moſt egregiouſly. This was an inſult not to be borne; he ſeized
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0906500201:91"/>the biggeſt immediately, and complimented him with juſt ſuch another blow as he had formerly given the ſcavenger. The fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low roſe, pretended the injury was quite accidental, and inſiſted on receiving ſome ſatisfaction for the aſſault. A crowd gathered round; and the gentleman, as before, offered the aggreſſor battle. The challenge was accepted, and the ſweep ſtripped in what is called <hi>buff,</hi> but which did not, in this caſe at leaſt, give any great idea of that colour. The ring was now formed, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat was about to commence; when a fellow ruſhed in, ſtripped for the fight, ſwearing heartily that the gentleman ſhould not leſſen himſelf by engaging in ſuch a conteſt, for that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would fight any man who offended him. He gave no time for parley; but inſtantly attacked the chimney-ſweeper, and to it they went thoroughly in earneſt. In a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, Victory declared herſelf againſt the chimney-ſweeper, whoſe eyes were in a fair way for emulating the colour of his cloth; and the gentleman ſoon recognized, in his preſent cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, the ſcavenger whom he had a few months before ſo ſeverely drubbed.</p>
                  <p>"There, you dog!" cried the exulting victor, to the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited ſweep, "down on your marrow-bones, and thank me for your life! By the Lord Harry, if you had fought with that gentleman, you would now have been in the other country: for he licked me, a little while ago, twice as much as I have beat you. So, you dog, I have ſaved your bacon, and you ought at leaſt to give me a guinea."</p>
                  <p>"Well," cried the gentleman, "my old friend, you are fairly entitled to the guinea, and you ſhall have it."</p>
                  <p>He accordingly gave him that ſum, deſiring him to afford the poor devil he had beaten a draught of beer out of it: and away the combatants jogged cordially together, to the next publick-houſe; where they related pretty fairly what had happened— to the great edification of many of their aſſembled brethren, who have ſince been conſiderably more cautious of wantonly giving offence to gentlemen, though ſome of the moſt mean and daſtardly ſtill occaſionally gratify the native malevolence of their diſpoſitions by making their dirty attacks on ladies. However, as no perſon who deſerves the name of a gentleman —or, indeed, of a man—can tamely ſee any female thus inſulted, it is hoped that ſuch practices, as we become more poliſhed and accompliſhed, will ſoon totally decline, and render unneceſſary the adminiſtration of a remedy which, though rough, is not ſo dangerous as the timid are apt to ſuppoſe, and which, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applied, never fails to give at leaſt a temporary relief, and ſeldom to effect a compleat and laſting cure, in that ſtrange malady, ſo peculiar to the vulgar—a loathing of decency in dreſs.</p>

                  <head>STORY OF A DISABLED VETERAN. SUPPOSED TO BE TOLD BY HIMSELF.</head>
                  <byline>BY DR. GOLDSMITH.</byline>
                  <p>AS for my misfortunes, maſter, I cannot pretend to have gone through any more than other folks; for except the loſs of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any reaſon, thank Heaven, that I have to complain. There is Bill Tibbs, of our regiment, he has loſt <hi>both</hi> his legs, and an eye to boot; but, thank Heaven, it is not ſo bad with me yet. I was born in Shropſhire; my father was a labourer, and died when I was five years old: ſo I was put upon the pariſh. As he had been a wandering ſort of a man, the pariſhioners were not able to tell to what pariſh I belonged, or where I was born; ſo they ſent me to another pariſh, and that pariſh ſent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept ſending me about ſo long, that they would not let me be born in any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh at all; but at laſt, however, they fixed me. I had ſome diſpoſition to be a ſcholar, and was reſolved at leaſt to know my letters; but the maſter of the workhouſe put me to buſineſs as ſoon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an eaſy kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and bad my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not ſuffered to ſtir out of the houſe; for fear, as they ſaid, I ſhould run away. But what of that! I had the liberty of the whole houſe, and the yard before the door; and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer; where I was up both early and late, but I eat and drank well, and liked my buſineſs well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for myſelf; ſo I was reſolved to go and ſeek my fortune. In this manner I went from town to town; worked when I could get employment, and ſtarved when I could get none: when, happening one day to go through a field belonging to a juſtice of peace, I ſpied a hare croſſing the path juſt before me, and I believe the devil put it into my head to fling my ſtick at it. Well! what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away in triumph, when the juſtice himſelf met me. He called me a poacher, and a villain; and, collaring me, deſired I would give an account of myſelf. I fell on my knees, begged his worſhip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all I knew of my breed, ſeed, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but though I gave a very good account, the juſtice would not believe a ſyllable I had to ſay: ſo I was indicted at the ſeſſions; found guilty of being poor, and ſent up to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to Newgate, in order to be tranſported as a vagabond.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0906500201:93"/>People may ſay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my belly-full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to laſt for ever; ſo I was taken out of priſon after five months, put on board a ſhip, and ſent off to the plantations. We had but an indifferent paſſage; for, being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred died for want of ſweet air; and thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained were ſickly enough, God knows! When we came aſhore, we were ſold to the planters, and I was bound for ſeven years more. As I was no ſcholar—for I did not know my letters—I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I ſerved out my time as in duty bound to do. When my time was expired, I worked my paſſage home; and glad I was to ſee Old England again—becauſe I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I ſhould be indicted for a vagabond once more; ſo did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs when I could get them. I was very happy in this manner for ſome time; till one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then deſired me to ſtand. They belonged to a preſs-gang; I was carried before the juſtice; and, as I could give no account of myſelf, I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war, or liſt for a ſoldier. I choſe the latter; and in this poſt of a gentleman I ſerved two campaigns in Flanders, was at the battles of Val and Fontenoy, and received but one wound through the breaſt here; but the doctor of our regiment ſoon made me well again. When the peace came on, I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; and as I could not work, becauſe my wound was ſometimes troubleſome, I liſted for a landman in the Eaſt India Company's ſervice. I here fought the French in ſix pitched battles; and, I verily believe, that if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion; for I ſoon fell ſick, and ſo got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning of the late war; and I hoped to be ſet on ſhore, and to have the pleaſure of ſpending my money: but the government wanted men; and ſo I was preſſed for a ſailor before ever I could ſet a foot on ſhore. The boatſwain found me, as he ſaid, an obſtinate fellow. He ſwore that he knew that I underſtood my buſineſs well, but that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hammed Abram merely to be idle: but, God knows, I knew nothing of ſea buſineſs; and he beat me without conſidering what he was about. I had ſtill, however, my forty pounds, and that was ſome comfort to me under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our ſhip was taken by the French, and ſo I loſt all. Our crew was carried
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0906500201:94"/>into Breſt, and many of them died becauſe they were not uſed to live in a jail; but for my part it was nothing to me, for I was ſeaſoned. One night, as I was ſleeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me—for I always love to lie well— I was awakened by the boatſwain, who had a dark-lanthorn in his hand. "Jack," ſay he to me, "will you knock out the French ſentries brains?"—"I don't care," ſays I, ſtriving to keep myſelf awake, "it I lend a hand!"—"Then follow me," ſays he; and I hope we ſhall do their buſineſs." So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the cloaths I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the Frenchmen. I hate the French, becauſe they are all ſlaves, and wear wooden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoes. Though we had no arms, one Engliſhman is able to beat five French at any time: ſo we went down to the door where both ſentries were poſted; and, ruſhing upon them, ſeized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence nine of us ran together to the quay; and, ſeizing the firſt boat we met, got ſafe out of the harbour, and put to ſea. We had not been here three days, before we were taken up by the Dorſet privateer; who were glad of ſo many good hands, and we conſented to run our chance. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; ſo to it we went, yard-arm, and yard-arm. The fight laſted for three hours; and I verily believe we ſhould have taken the Frenchman, had we but had ſome more men left behind; but, unfortunately, we loſt all our men juſt as we were going to get the victory. I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to Breſt; but, by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, we were retaken by the Viper. I had almoſt forgot to tell you, that in that engagement I was wounded in two places; I loſt four fingers of the left-hand, and my leg was ſhot off. If I had had the good fortune to have loſt my leg, and the uſe of my hand, on board a king's ſhip, and not on board a privateer, I ſhould have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance during the reſt of my life; but that was not my chance. One man is born with a ſilver ſpoon in his mouth, and another with a wooden-ladle. However, bleſſed be God, I enjoy good health; and will for ever love Liberty and Old England. Liberty, Property, and Old England, for ever!</p>

                  <head>GRADATION FROM A GREENHORN TO A BLOOD. EXTRACTED FROM THE ADVENTURER.</head>
                  <p>THOUGH the characters of men have, perhaps, been eſſentially the ſame in all ages, yet their external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0906500201:95"/>has changed with other peculiarities of time and place, and they have been diſtinguiſhed by different names as new modes of expreſſion have prevailed: a periodical writer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who catches the picture of evaneſcent life, and ſhews the deformity of follies which in a few years will be ſo changed as not to be known, ſhould be careful to expreſs the character when he deſcribes the appearance, and to connect it with the name by which it then happens to be called. You have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed the terms. Buck and Blood, and have given ſome account of the characters which are thus denominated; but you have not conſidered them as the laſt ſtages of a regular progreſſion, nor taken any notice of thoſe which precede them. Their dependence upon each other is, indeed, ſo little known, that many ſuppoſe them to be diſtinct and collateral claſſes, formed by perſons of oppoſite intereſts, taſtes, capacities, and diſpoſitions: the ſcale, however, conſiſts of eight degrees; Greenhorn, Jemmy, Jeſſamy, Smart, Honeſt Fellow, Joyous Spirit, Buck, and Blood. As I have myſelf paſſed through the whole ſeries, I ſhall explain each ſtation by a ſhort account of my life, remarking the periods when my character changed it's denomination, and the particular incidents by which the change was produced.</p>
                  <p>My father was a wealthy farmer in Yorkſhire; and when I was near eighteen years of age, he brought me to London, and put me apprentice to a conſiderable ſhopkeeper in the city. There was an aukward modeſt ſimplicity in my manner, and a reverence of religion and virtue in my converſation. The novelty of the ſcene that was now placed before me, in which there were innumerable objects that I never conceived to exiſt, rendered me attentive and credulous: peculiarities which, without a provincial accent, a ſlouch in my gait, a long lank head of hair, and an unfaſhionable ſuit of drab-coloured cloth, would have denominated me a Greenhorn; or, in other words, a country put very green.</p>
                  <p>Green, then, I continued, even in externals, near two years; and in this ſtate I was the object of univerſal contempt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion: but being at length wearied with merriment and inſult, I was very ſedulous to aſſume the manners and appearance of thoſe who, in the ſame ſtation, were better treated. I had already improved greatly in my ſpeech; and my father having allowed me thirty pounds a year, for apparel and pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, the greater part of which I had ſaved, I beſpoke a ſuit of cloaths of an eminent city-taylor, with ſeveral waiſtcoats and breeches, and two frocks for a change; I cut off my hair, and procured a brown bob periwig of Wilding, juſt of the ſame colour, with a ſingle row of curls round the bottom, which I
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0906500201:96"/>wore very nicely combed, and without powder: my hat, which had been cocked with great exactneſs in an equilateral triangle, I diſcarded, and purchaſed one of a more faſhionable ſize, the ſore corner of which projected near two inches father than thoſe on each ſide, and was moulded into the ſhape of a ſpout: I alſo furniſhed myſelf with a change of white-thread ſtockings, took care that my pumps were varniſhed every morning with the new German blacking-ball; and when I went out, carried in my hand a little ſwitch, which, as it had been long append<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt to the character that I had juſt aſſumed, has taken the ſame name, and is called a Jemmy.</p>
                  <p>I ſoon perceived the advantage of this transformation. My manner had not, indeed, kept pace with my dreſs; I was ſtill modeſt and diffident, temperate and ſober, and conſequently ſtill ſubject to ridicule: but I was now admitted into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany from which I had before been excluded by the ruſticity of my appearance; I was raillied and encouraged by turns; and I was inſtructed both by precept and example. Some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were made of carrying me to a houſe of private entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which then I abſolutely refuſed; but I ſoon found the way into the play-houſe, to ſee the two laſt acts and the farce: here I learned that by breaches of chaſtity no man was thought to incur either guilt or ſhame; but that, on the contrary, they were eſſentially neceſſary to the character of a fine gentleman. I ſoon copied the original, which I found to be univerſally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, in my morals; and made ſome farther approaches to it in my dreſs: I ſuffered my hair to grow long enough to comb back over the foretop of my wig; which, when I ſallied forth to my evening amuſement, I changed to a queue. I tied the collar of my ſhirt with half an ell of black ribband, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under my neckcloth; the fore-corner of my hat was conſiderably elevated and ſhortened, ſo that it no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a ſpout, but the corner of a minced pye; my waiſtcoat was edged with a narrow lace, my ſtockings were ſilk, and I never appeared without a pair of clean gloves. My addreſs, from it's native maſculine plainneſs, was converted to an exceſs of ſoftneſs and civility, eſpecially when I ſpoke to the ladies. I had before made ſome progreſs in learning to ſwear; I had proceeded by fegs, faith, pox, plague, 'pon my life, 'pon my ſoul, rat it, and zookers, to zanns and the devil. I now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to by Jove, 'fore ged, ged's curſe it, and demme: but I ſtill uttered theſe interjections in a tremulous tone, and my pronounciation was feminine and vicious. I was ſenſible of my defects, and therefore applied with great diligence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them. I frequently practiſed alone, but it was a long time before I could ſwear ſo much to my own ſatisfaction in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0906500201:97"/>company, as by myſelf. My labour, however, was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it's reward; it recommended me to the notice of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and procured me the gentle appellation of Jeſſamy.</p>
                  <p>I now learned, among other Grown Gentlemen, to dance, which greatly enlarged my acquaintance. I entered into a ſubſcription for country-dances, once a week at a tavern, where each gentleman engaged to bring a partner: at the ſame time, I made conſiderable advances in ſwearing. I could pronounce damme with a tolerable air and accent, give the vowel it's full ſound, and look with confidence in the face of the perſon to whom I ſpoke. About this time, my father's eldeſt brother died, and left me an eſtate of near five hundred pounds per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. I now bought out the remainder of my time; and this ſudden acceſſion of wealth and independence gave me immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately an air of greater confidence and freedom. I laid out near one hundred and fifty pounds in cloaths, though I was obliged to go into mourning: I employed a court-taylor to make them up; I exchanged my queue for a bag; I put on a ſword, which, in appearance at leaſt, was a Toledo; and in proportion as I knew my dreſs to be elegant, I was leſs ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to be neat. My acquaintance now increaſed every hour; I was attended, flattered, and careſſed; was often invited to entertainments, fupped every night at a tavern, and went home in a chair; was taken notice of in publick places, and was univerſally confeſſed to be improved into a Smart.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome intervals in which I found it neceſſary to abſtain from wenching; and in theſe, at whatever riſque, I applied myſelf to the bottle: a habit of drinking came inſenſibly upon me, and I was ſoon able to walk home with a bottle and a pint. I had learned a ſufficient number of faſhionable toaſts, and had got by heart ſeveral toping, and ſeveral bawdy ſongs, ſome of which I ventured to roar out with a friend hanging on my arm as we ſcoured the ſtreet after our nocturnal revel. I now laboured with indefatigable induſtry to increaſe thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions: I enlarged my ſtock of healths; made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in ſinging, joking, and ſtory-telling; ſwore well; could make a company of ſtaunch topers drunk; always collected the reckoning, and was the laſt man that departed. My face began to be covered with red pimples, and my eyes to be weak; I became daily more negligent of my dreſs, and more blunt in my manner; I profeſſed myſelf a foe to ſtarters and milkſops, declared that there was no enjoyment equal to that of a bottle and a friend, and ſoon gained the apellation of an Honeſt Fellow.</p>
                  <p>By this diſtinction I was animated to attempt yet greater excellence; I learned ſeveral feats of mimickry of the under
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0906500201:98"/>players, could take off known characters, tell a ſtaring ſtory. and humbug with ſo much ſkill as ſometimes to take-in a knowing one. I was ſo ſucceſsful in the practice of theſe arts, to which, indeed, I applied myſelf with unwearied diligence and aſſiduity, that I kept my company roaring with applauſe, till their voices ſunk by degrees, and they were no longer able either to hear or to ſee. I had now aſcended another ſcale in the climax; and was acknowledged by all who knew me, to be a Joyous Spirit.</p>
                  <p>After all theſe topicks of merriment were exhauſted, and I had repeated my tricks, my ſtories, my jokes and my ſongs, till they grew inſipid, I became miſchievous; and was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deviſing and executing Frolicks, to the unſpeakable delight of my companions, and the injury of others, For many of them I was proſecuted, and frequently obliged to pay large damages: but I bore all theſe loſes with an air of jovial indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. I puſhed on in my career; I was more deſperate in proportion as I had leſs to loſe; and being deterred from no miſchief by the dread of it's conſequences, I was ſaid to run at all, and was complimented by the name of a Buck.</p>
                  <p>My eſtate was at length mortgaged for more than it was worth; creditors were importunate; I became neglectful of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others; I made a deſperate effort at the gaming-table, and loſt the laſt ſum that I could raiſe; my eſtate was ſeized by the mortgagee; I learned to pack cards, and to cog a die; became a bully to whores; paſſed my nights in a brothel, the ſtreet, or the watch-houſe; was utterly in ſenſible of ſhame; and lived upon the town as a beaſt of prey in a foreſt. Thus I reached the ſummit of modern glory; and had juſt acquired the character of a blood, when I was arreſted for an old debt of three hundred pounds, and thrown into the King's Bench Priſon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe characters, Sir, though they are diſtinct, yet do not at all differ, otherwiſe than as ſhades of the ſame colour; and, though they are ſtages of a regular progreſſion, yet the whole progreſs is not made by every individual: ſome are ſo ſoon initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the myſteries of the town, that they are never publickly known in their Green-horn ſtate; others ſix long in the Jem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myhood, others are Jeſſamys at fourſcore, and ſome ſtagnate in each of the higher ſtages for life. But I requeſt that they may never hereafter be confounded, either by you or your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents. Of the Blood, your brother adventurer, Mr. Wildgooſe, though he aſſumes the character, does not ſeem to have a juſt and preciſe idea as diſtinct from the Buck, in which claſs he ſhould be placed, and will probably die; for he ſeems determined to ſhoot himſelf juſt at the time when
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0906500201:99"/>his circumſtances will enable him to aſſume the higher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions.</p>
                  <p>But the retroſpect upon life, which this letter has made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, covers me with confuſion, and aggravates deſpair. I cannot but reflect that, among all theſe characters, I have never aſſumed that of a Man. Man is a Reaſonable Being; which he ceaſes to be, who diſguiſes his body with ridiculous fopperies, or degrades his mind by deteſtable brutality. Theſe thoughts would have been of great uſe to me if they had occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſeven years ago. If they are of uſe to you, I hope you will ſend me a ſmall gratuity for my labour, to alleviate the miſery of hunger and nakedneſs: but, dear Sir, let your bounty be ſpeedy, leſt I periſh before it arrive.</p>

                  <p>YOU have heard my drum, and now it is my turn. It is a common ſaying, that the king cannot make a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but, look you, he that uttered it firſt, whether herald to Tom Thumb, or Jack the Giant-Killer, lyed in his throat; for whoever can beſtow arms, can make a gentleman. Now, ſimple as I ſtand here, the king has beſtowed arms on me, wherefore I am a gentleman; and, if it is my good will and pleaſure, I can tranſlate a ſcore or two of you to the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And what can you do better? You are now a pack of dirty, meagre, ragamuffin ſcoundrels; ſlaves to your maſters, drudges to your wives, and the property of gin-ſhops, ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, pawn-brokers, and exciſemen: whereas, take but this piece of gold, and handle this brown muſket, your debts are diſcharged, the king's your pay-maſter, your wives may hang themſelves, and you may live at free quarter upon other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's. To make ſhort of my ſtory, you become as good gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen as I am: and, on the ſtrength of your ſword, may take the wall of a better man when you pleaſe. But, perhaps, you have no great ſtomach for fighting; you may fancy the Spaniards ſeaſon their oglios with Engliſhmen's ears, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth. Never fear! threatened folks live longeſt. And I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have been in the ſervice, man and boy, theſe five and twenty years, and never once looked an enemy in the face. Lord help you! if Chelſea College was to be filled with none but ſuch as had loſt their eyes, ears, or noſes, in the field of battle, the income might, in time, be turned over to Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0906500201:100"/>Hoſpital, and the building itſelf be occupied by nurſes and foundling children! Do not be afraid of ſighting, then: my life for yours, you will have no reaſon. The Power above, to whom we owe our being, has taken us into his protection and favour; and has determined that not a hair of our heads ſhall fall to the ground. Nay, if we ſeem to be in danger, he makes it his buſineſs to deliver us; and if our enemies plot our deſtruction, he never fails to confound them. Oh! but the wags make themſelves merry with muſters and reviews, powder and cockades, and ſo-forth. Why let them; they pay dear enough for their jokes, God knows! And, if they have wit and common ſenſe on their ſide, we have abuſe and Billingſgate on ours: among friends, a whole legion of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reteers, gentlemen, who indite curiouſly, are bound, by their articles, to defend us; to defend us from being diſbanded in time of peace, and from being employed in time of war; nay, more, to pen chronicles of our exploits, and take their Bible oaths that a cockle-ſhell is a Spaniſh piſtole.</p>
                  <p>But, good people—gentlemen I would call you; but, as I ſaid before, you muſt firſt bear arms—not to lead you beyond your depth, fleece or be fleeced is the word! and, whether it is beſt to be the ſheep or the ſhearer, judge for yourſelves. You ſee, we land-officers do not preſs people into the ſervice, nor clap them under hatches, or ſtow them in infirmaries: but I ſay no more. Step to the parade! attend a review! there you will ſee us in our glory! Let clean ſpatterdaſhes, powdered hair, drums and colours, ſpeak for themſelves; and, if you have a mind to whet your whiſtles with his Majeſty's double beer in the mean while, follow me. Huzza! God ſave the King!</p>

                        <l>I knew that the giſts would allure,</l>
                        <l>And I follow'd, the iſſue to ſee;</l>

                        <l>And another intended; but, oh!</l>
                        <l>She caught ſuch a ſoretaſte of bliſs,</l>
                        <l>That ſhe quak'd from her top to her too.</l>

                        <l>But ſoon I perceiv'd that it pleas'd her;</l>

                  <p>THE good Mr. Weſt, wearied with the vain expectation of ſeeing any amendment in his vicious apprentice, Thomas Idle, and finding, on the contrary, that he grew ſtill worſe and worſe; as a laſt effort to ſave the youth from total deſtruction, by dividing him from his profligate companions, he procured him to be ſent on board a man of war. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the navy; he well knew, muſt in ſome meaſure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect indolent habits; and he hoped that the youth might yet be made a uſeful member of ſociety. This print accordingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents our unpromiſing hero, in the ſhip's boat, accompanied by his mourning mother, whoſe dreſs denotes her widowhood; and gives riſe to the reflection, that ſhe is thus reſigning her laſt hope, the once fondly cheriſhed ſolace and ſupport of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining years!</p>

Theſe hints he receives without emotion; and, to evince his equal talent for raillery, diſplays two fingers held up as horns, and calls the married man's attention to Cuckold's Point, which at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

                  <head>SERMON ON THE WORD MALT. PREACHED BY THE REV. MR. DODD, IN A HOLLOW TREE.</head>
                  <p>THE Rev. Mr. Dodd, a very worthy miniſter, who lived a few miles from Cambridge, had rendered himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to many of the Cantabs by frequently preaching againſt drunkenneſs; ſeveral of whom meeting him on a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they determined to make him preach in a hollow tree which was near the road-ſide. Accordingly, addreſſing him with great apparent politeneſs, they aſked him if he had not lately preached much againſt drunkenneſs. On his replying in the affirmative, they inſiſted that he ſhould now preach from a text of their chuſing. In vain did he remonſtrate on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of expecting him to give them a diſcourſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtudy, and in ſuch a place; they were determined to take no denial, and the word MALT was given him by way of text: on which he immediately delivered himſelf as follows—</p>
                  <p>"BELOVED, let me crave your attention—I am a little man, come at a ſhort warning, to preach a ſhort ſermon from a ſmall ſubject, in an unworthy pulpit, to a ſmall congregation. Beloved, my text is MALT: I cannot divide it into words, it being but one; nor into ſyllables, it being but one: I muſt, therefore, of neceſſity, divide it into letters, which I find to be theſe four, M—A—L—T.</p>
                  <p>"M, my beloved, is Moral—A, is Allegorical—L, is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral—T, is Theological. The Moral is ſet forth to teach you drunkards good-manners; therefore, M, Maſters—A, All of you—L, Liſten—T, to my Text. The Allegorical is when
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0906500201:113"/>one thing is ſpoken, and another thing is meant. The thing ſpoken of is Malt: the thing meant, is the juice of Mait; which you Cantabs make—M, your Maſter—A, your A ppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel —L, your Liberty—and T, your Truſt. The Literal is, according to the Letter—M, Much—A, Ale—L, Little—T, Truſt. The Theological is according to the effects that it works; and theſe I find to be of two kinds: firſt, in this world; ſecondly, in the world to come. The effects that it works in this world are, in ſome—M, Murder—in others, A, Adultery —in all, L, Looſeneſs of Life—and, in ſome, T, Treaſon. The effects that it works in the world to come—are, M, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery—A, Anguiſh—L, Lamentation—and T, Torment. And ſo much for this time and text.</p>
                  <p>"I ſhall improve this: firſt, by way of exhortation—M, Maſters—A, All of you—L, Leave off—T, Tipling; or, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by way of excommunication—M, Maſters—A, All of you—L, Look for—T, Torment. Thirdly, by way of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, take this: A drunkard is the annoyance of modeſty, the ſpoil of civility, the deſtruction of reaſon, the brewer's agent, the alehouſe benefactor, his wife's ſorrow, his children's trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his own ſhame, his neighbour's ſcoff, a walking ſwill-bowl, the picture of a beaſt, and the monſter of a man.</p>
                  <p>"Now to," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He then concluded in the uſual form; and the young men, pleaſed with his ingenuity, not only ſincerely thanked him, but abſolutely profited more by this ſhort and whimſical ſermon, than by any ſerious diſcourſe they had ever heard.</p>

                  <p>I Sit down to write in behalf of a ſet of gentlemen in this town, called Authors; whoſe appearance in publick, for many prudent reaſons, being ſeldom, and their habitations far above the common level with the reſt of mankind, they paſs unnoticed by the generality of the world, and are looked upon by others as a name without a being,</p>
                  <p>From whence this want of reſpect for ſo conſiderable a body of men proceeds, I will not take upon me to ſay; but, certain it is, that many worthy wits by profeſſion are ſtarving in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, while the gravitation of dulneſs daily brings hundreds to and from the Exchange, and the neighbouring alleys, in their chariots.</p>
                  <p>What a ſad reflection it is, that the moſt beautiful ode in Horace will not raiſe ſixpence in the city, when an ordinary
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0906500201:114"/>knowledge of the multiplication-table will accumulate eſtates I This unaccountable humour in the nation, of preferring the writings of the Bank directors to thoſe of the ſons of Parnaſſus, has reduced many a fine poetical genius to darn his own ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>A friend of mine, who accidentally became acquainted with two or three of theſe great men, who nobly defy poverty for the ſake of exhibiting their extraordinary talents, took me one day to viſit them in their occupation. We were led by the maſter of the houſe where they lodged, a bookſeller by trade, up a very handſome pair of ſtairs, where I imagined we ſhould have been introduced to the literati on the firſt floor; but, how great was my ſurprize, to be conducted up two or three ſtories more, and then up a ladder into a cock-loft! where eight or nine of theſe illuſtrious ſpirits were amuſing themſelves with compoſitions of various ſorts: not, as our guide ſeemed to inſinuate, for the lucre of porter and pudding, but from the noble motive of benefiting mankind by their lucubrations. I muſt own, their unſuitable ſituation made me feel ſome concern for them, though they ſeemed to have very little for themſelves. But my attention to their deplorable circumſtances was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by a miſtake, that my ignorance of their trade led me into; for, after the firſt introductory ſalutations were over, they fell again to their former employments, without taking any farther notice of us; and, as I was very attentive, out of curioſity, I heard one of them call ſoftly acroſs the table to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other who ſat oppoſite to him—"Pr'ythee, Matt. Prior, lend me thy ſimile of the bird's-neſt."</p>
                  <p>On my expreſſing ſome ſurprize at the name of Matt. Prior, my friend whiſpered me, that every one of the gentlemen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated ſome poet of note, and imitated, as well as they were able, his ſtile; and that ſuch compoſitions were publiſhed under the titles of Remains, Poſthumous Works, &amp;c. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, but my indignation began to be kindled at a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo injurious to the deceaſed, had not an object of a different nature excited my laughter; for while theſe deputy harmoniſts were coupling their rhimes together, an old woman of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable aſpect mounted the ladder, and informed the company that the milk-porridge was ready: the pens were inſtantly ſluck behind their ears, the ink remained in peace, and the ſound of beams, purling ſtreams, loves, doves, and groves, was heard no more.</p>
                  <p>I imagined, as ſoon as the viſit was over, that my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with theſe ſons of the Muſes would be ſo too: but I very ſoon after found my error; for, as I was walking in St. James's Park the next Sunday, I obſerved three gentlemen in ruſty phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0906500201:115"/>black coats, braſs-hilted ſwords, and tye-wigs, riſing up from one of the benches to meet me. When they were come a little nearer, I perceived one of them to be my old friend the ſimile-lender, the worthy repreſentative of Matt. Prior, who accoſted me with the moſt obliging condeſcenſion.</p>
                  <p>As our converſation, during my ſtay in the Park, was pretty long, I ſhall not trouble you with a particular account of it, any farther than to acquaint you that it began with animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting on the damned taſte of the town, as they called it; and concluded with their borrowing half a crown apiece of me. Such is the condition of many a great ſoul in this kingdom; who, magnanimouſly ſcorning to engroſs, to pound in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or live like any other vile mechanick, has rather choſe to confine himſelf ſix days in ſeven, feeling the inward call of a poetical ſpirit, than breathe the ſame air with the illiterate mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude! As many hundreds, therefore, are led into great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, not by their own faults, but by this writing devil that poſſeſſes them, I think it would be a charity altogether worthy of the preſent publick ſpirit, to found an hoſpital for neceſſitous authors; ſuch, I mean, as are not quite furious; for thoſe, of courſe, will be admitted into that founded by the late Dean of St. Patrick's for lunaticks; and, as no ſcheme of this ſort has hitherto been laid before the publick, I beg leave to inſert the following in your Miſeellany.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing to be conſidered is a proper ſpot to build an hoſpital on; for which I think Tothill Fields would be very convenient, as they lie contiguous to the banks of the fertile Thames, whoſe ſtreams have been the ſubject of ſo many fine compoſitions, and may ſerve to recal, even in old age, the ideas of their former rapture. The ſtructure ſhould be of the old Gothick collegiate architecture, containing about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred apartments; not regular and uniform, but of different ſizes, &amp;c. according to the different geniuſes and diſpoſitions of thoſe that are to be admitted.</p>
                  <p>In this point, too, the ſituation of the chambers ought to be obſerved; for inſtance, the compilers of vade-mecums, abridgement-makers, &amp;c. ſhould be ſtationed in the cellars under-ground; the ode-writers, next to the ſky-light; the tranſlators, on the ground-floor; and the epick and dramatick authors, on the firſt and ſecond ſtories. In the midſt of the whole I would have a large hall, where the whole ſociety ſhould meet three times a day, to be provided at every meal with diſhes adapted to their conſtitutions; for care muſt be had, that the gentlemen who ſoar "above the viſible diurnal ſphere," do not eat of beef, or any other meat that is ſubject to clog the intellects; but be fed, as Pindar and the bards of old were, with food that elates and puts the fancy on the wing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0906500201:116"/>This college ſhould be governed by a preſident and twelve directors; all of whom ſhould have been bookſellers in London for the ſpace of ſeven years before the time they are elected ſuch, that they may be thereby qualified to judge properly of the pretenſions of the candidates to this charity. Every can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate muſt have the recommendation of one or more of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, and a certificate under the hands and ſeals of four of the company of Stationers, that he has been muſe-rid for ten years, in ſuch a manner as to be entirely incapacitated for any other vocation in life. If theſe things ſeem clear, the perſon ſhall be admitted without farther trouble, except he is proved to be worth money; for a rich man muſt be as incapable to enter this hoſpital "as the kingdom of heaven."</p>
                  <p>We next come to the choice of proper ſervants and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. Now, as there are in the three kingdoms innumerable footmen and chambermaids, who ſpend beſt part of their time with Lee and Otway, and daily condemn Fate for having placed people of their uncommon talents in ſuch a ſituation, as to be ſubject to be called every moment from the heroick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Alexander and Roxana, and ſent to converſe, much againſt their inclination, with the dregs of the people; I would have ſuch as are diſpoſed to live retired, and to have frequent opportunities of converſing not only with dead poets, but living wits, come and offer their ſervice to the hoſpital, where they ſhall be furniſhed with every thing neceſſary for life, and be allowed, after the little labour that ſhall be required of them is over, ſtated hours for their favourite ſtudies.</p>
                  <p>When theſe things are all ſettled, and a handſome ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is opened, the legiſlature, no doubt, will give encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſo noble, uſeful, and charitable a foundation, by eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the lands and funds raiſed for it's ſupport by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary authority; and, if it would not be looked on as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to give a hint to ſo wiſe and auguſt an aſſembly, a tax might be laid, which would bring in vaſt ſums annually, and at the ſame time be no burden to the induſtrious ſubject, but tend, on the contrary, to promote every branch of trade in the nation.</p>
                  <p>The tax I mean, ſhould be laid on that unprofitable commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity which abounds ſo much in theſe kingdoms, commonly called Scribbling. There ſhould be in every pariſh an inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor into this manufactory—the parſon, for inſtance—who ſhould take his rounds once a week, like the exciſeman, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit thoſe who are dealers, and receive the limited duty: and, in order to obviate any fraud, very large penalties might be laid on all ſuch as ſhould clandeſtinely make verſe or proſe, or a mixture of both, which I think is moſt in requeſt at preſent,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0906500201:117"/>without previouſly acquainting the eccleſiaſtical officer, or at leaſt informing him immediately after. This expence would hinder many an attorney's clerk and apprentice from Philising away his time, and keep him from being reduced at laſt to the hoſpital.</p>
                  <p>Should it be objected by the proprietors of other periodical miſcellanies, that ſuch tax would deprive them of many inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious performances, both in verſe and proſe; the grievances may be redreſſed by applying to the directors, and compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them at ſo much a year for all their authors in a lump, as thoſe people do with commiſſioners of turnpikes who live near the gate.</p>
                  <p>Having thrown together theſe looſe thoughts, I leave the publick to improve my project, and ſhall be happy to ſubſcribe my mite for the eſtabliſhment of ſo neceſſary an inſtitution.</p>

                  <p>I aſſured him that, ſo far from having any reliſh for theſe deteſtable noiſes, the more they reſembled the originals, the leſs I ſhould like them: and, if I could ever be fool enough to go, ſhould at leaſt be wiſe enough to ſtop my ears till I came out again.</p>
                  <p>Having lamented my deplorable want of taſte, by the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his eye-brows, and a ſignificant ſhrug of his ſhoulders, he thruſt his fore-finger againſt the inſide of his cheek, and plucking it out of his mouth with a jerk, made a noiſe that very much reſembled the drawing of a cork. I found that, by this ſignal, he meant to aſk me if I choſe a whet? I gave my conſent, by a ſulky kind of nod, and walked into the back room, as much aſhamed of my nephew as he ought to have been of himſelf. While he was gone to fetch a pint of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the other ſide of the ſtreet, I had an opportunity to minute down a few of the articles of which the litter of his apartment conſiſted; and have ſelected theſe, as the moſt material, from among them—</p>

                  <head>IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CAT-ORGAN. ADDRESSED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Need not inform perſons of your infinite experience and erudition, that the Cat-Organ, as it has hitherto been made uſe of, was no more than what followeth, viz. A plain harpſichord; which, inſtead of having ſtrings and jacks, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Cats of different ſizes, included in boxes, whoſe voices expreſs every note in the gamut, which is extorted from the impriſoned animals by placing their tails in grooves, which are properly ſqueezed by the impreſſion of the organiſt's fingers on the keys. This inſtrument, unimproved as it was, I have often heard with incredible delight, but eſpecially in the grand and plaintive. This delight grew upon me every time I was preſent at it's performance. At length I ſhut myſelf up for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, to ſtudy ſome additions and improvements, which I have at length accompliſhed, agreeable to my warmeſt wiſhes; and which I with all due ſubmiſſion now lay before you.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, then, it is univerſally known and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that theſe animals, at the time of their amours, are the moſt muſical creatures in nature; I would therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to all and ſingular Cat-Organiſts, to have a moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0906500201:121"/>regard to the time of caterwauling, particularly if they have anything very auguſt or affecting to exhibit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is alſo very well known that the beſt voices are improved by caſtration; I therefore never have leſs than eight geldings in my treble clef. And here I cannot help informing you of an experiment I lately made on an Italian boar-cat, and and Engliſh one of the ſame gender; and I ſolemnly proteſt that, after the operation, my country animal had every whit as delicate, piercing, and comprehenſive a tone, as the foreigner: and I make no ſort of doubt that ſome of our harmonious Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen would ſhine with an equal luſtre, if they had the ſame advantages as the Italians. This may be worth the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of people in power: for, if this experiment had been tried with ſucceſs, how many thouſand pounds would it have ſaved this nation!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Of the Forte and Piano. I muſt not omit to tell you, gentlemen, that my Cat-Organ reſembles a double harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſichord; for, as that has two rows of keys, ſo mine has two layers of Cats, both of a leſſer ſize, and whoſe tails are ſqueezed by a much leſs preſſure; that is, by nothing but the bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the key. But the lower row, on which I play forte, or loudly, contains an harmonious ſociety of banging grimalkins; and whoſe tails are ſeverely pricked by braſs pins, inſerted at the end of the key for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Of the Shake. There was one enormous defect in this inſtrument, before I took it in hand, and that was in the ſhake; the imperfection of which gave me great offence. But, as it is now managed, it has the moſt raviſhing effect in the world. There are between all the keys little wires fixed almoſt imperceptibly; theſe go underneath till they reach each puſs's throat: at the extremity of theſe wires are placed hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally wrens quills, about the length of a quarter of an inch. When the artiſt, therefore, has a mind to form his ſhake, he touches the wires, which ſoon ſend the quills in a tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, up to the Cat's throat, and cauſes the moſt gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, warbling, ſhaking, quaking, trembling, murmuring ſound, in the world.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly. Of the Staccato, and an infallible method of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the four-footed performers under proper regulations.</p>
                  <p>This moſt intolerable deficiency of the old Cat-Organ was as follows: ſome of the Cats were apt to continue their mew after the proper note was expreſſed, to the great confuſion of the tune, and vexation of the organiſt. This I have entirely cured; and, I think, I can play the moſt perfect ſtaccato in the world. I have underneath my inſtrument a treddle, like that of a ſpinning-wheel, which I work with my foot: this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0906500201:122"/>treddle actuates a certain number of forceps or pincers, which open and ſhut, at my pleaſure, upon the noſes and chins of all the Cats; and if any of them over-act their part, I tip St. Dunſtan upon Mrs. Puſs, and ſhe is obliged of neceſſity to be ſilent.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly. Of the education of Cats for the Organ. My pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors were egregiouſly out in this article, as well as many others; which, whatever it may appear to the incredulous or incurious, is a matter of importance. With regard to their diet, milk and flummery, fried mice and fiſh, have the beſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; I mean, for the trebles and tenors: as for the baſes, I have fed them with good ſucceſs on bullock's liver, hog's harſlet's, and ſometimes with viands of a much leſs delicate nature. As for exerciſe, moderate mouſing, and being well tugged and hauled about by the children, will very well ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Collier, in his Eſſay on Muſick, ſays—that he makes no doubt that there might be a warlike inſtrument contrived, of ſuch an hideous ſound, that inſtead of inſpiring men with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, it would ſtrike the moſt undaunted with diſmay. This may be effected by the above-mentioned inſtrument: for though the Cat-Organ, when accurately in tune, is incomparably me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious, yet it may be ſo managed, as to utter ſhrieks very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferior to the cries of the infernals themſelves. Happy that inſtrument, where terror and tranſport, ornament and utility, are ſo exquiſitely blended! which, by it's perſuaſive harmony, can at one time draw St. Cecilia from the ſpheres; and, at another, with proper alteration, would frighten away the devil himſelf in propriâ perſonâ!</p>

Being now ſtopped, he was told the caſe, and what office he was appointed to perform. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his own inſufficiency to execute the buſineſs, he was ſo confounded, that he ſcarcely knew how to reply. "What!" exclaimed he, "would you make a common executioner of me! Alas, ſhall I ſtain my blood to eternity! Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my honour from ſuch baſeneſs!" All his remonſtrances, however, proving quite fruitleſs, he prepared himſelf for the work; and, keeling down, prayed—" O Juſt and Almighty Ruler of Heaven, if this man ought not to die, convert this my faithful ſword into wood!" Then, plucking it out, and it appearing plainly to be a wooden blade, the condemned gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was immediately releaſed with abundance of joy; and the ſword was carried with great ſolemnity to the cathedral church, where it was hung up as a true link to the chain of Popiſh miracles.</p>

If you can make any apology, or aſſign any reaſon for it, 'tis well; if you cannot, aſſure yourſelf that I will cauſe you to be ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed."—" Since your honour is ſo good," replied Richard, "as to permit me to ſpeak for myſelf, an't pleaſe your worſhip, I have been eight days on the march, with a bare allowance of ſixpence a day, which, your honour will ſurely allow, is hardly ſufficient to find a man in meat, drink, waſhing, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries; and, conſequently, he may want either a bible, prayer-book, or any other book." On ſaying this, Richard pulled
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0906500201:125"/>out his cards, preſented one of the aces to the magiſtrate, and continued his addreſs to him as follows—"When I ſee an ace. may it pleaſe your honour, it reminds me that there is only one God; and when I look on a two, or a three, the former puts me in mind of the Father and Son, and the latter of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. A four calls to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the four evangeliſts, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; a five, the five Wiſe Virgins who were ordered to trim their lamps—there were ten ordered, but five, your worſhip may remember, were wiſe, and five were fooliſh—a ſix, that in ſix days God created heaven and earth; a ſeven, that on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day he reſted from all he had made; an eight, of the eight righteous perſons preſerved from the Deluge, viz. Noah and his wife, with his three ſons and their wives; a nine—of the lepers cleanſed by our Saviour—there were ten, but one only returned to offer his tribute of thanks; and a ten, of the ten commandments." Richard took the knave, and placed it by him; and then paſſed to the Queen, on which he obſerved as follows—"This queen, your worſhip, reminds me of the Queen of Sheba, who came from the uttermoſt parts of the earth to hear the wiſdom of Solomon; as her companion, the king, does of the Great King of Heaven, and of King George the Third."—"Well," replied the magiſtrate, "you have given me a very good deſcription of all the cards except the knave."—"If your honour will not be angry with me," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Richard, "I can give you the ſame ſatisfaction as to that, as of any card in the pack."—"I will not," ſaid the magiſtrate. "Well," returned the ſoldier, "the greateſt knave I know is the ſerjeant who brought me before you."— "I don't know," replied the magiſtrate, "whether he is the greateſt knave, or not, but I am ſure he is the greateſt fool or the two." The ſoldier then proceeded—"When I count the number of dots in a pack of cards, there are 365; ſo many days are there in a year. When I count how many cards there are in a pack, I find fifty two; ſo many weeks are there in a year. When I reckon how many tricks are won by a pack of cards, I find there are thirteen; ſo many months are there in a year. So that this pack of cards is both bible, almanack, and prayer-book, to me."</p>
                  <p>The magiſtrate then called his ſervants, ordered them to entertain the ſoldier well, gave him a piece of money, and ſaid he was the clevereſt fellow in the whole regiment.</p>

                     <l>And each aſſum'd a look as ſtupid,</l>

                  <p>IN this print, Francis Goodchild, the Induſtrious Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, receives what may be denominated commercial as well as poetical juſtice. His worthy maſter, Mr. Weſt, at the completion of his apprenticeſhip, has not only taken him into partnerſhip, as appears from the union of their names— "Weſt and Goodchild," on the ſign, but he alſo receives from his maſter's hand, the ſtill ſuperior bleſſing of an amiable, virtuous, and beloved daughter.</p>
                  <p>The reſidence of theſe reſpectable citizens is ſituated near the Monument; part of which ſtately column, as well as the firſt lines of the Inſcription, is ſufficiently viſible. The point of time, is the morning after the happy nuptials, while the newly married pair are at breakfaſt. The cavalcade of drummers, butchers with marrow-bones and cleavers, the man with the baſs-viol, &amp;c. form the then uſual concert on ſuch occaſions, and which is not remarkably figurative of the harmony that ought to follow the ceremony it pretends to celebrate. The wretched cripple in the corner, who is adding to the Hymeneal muſick, by vociferating the ballad of Jeſſe, or the Happy Pair, repreſents a well known beggar, of that period, commonly called Philip in the Tub; and who, within the memory of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſtill living, is recollected to have been a uſual attendant at

                  <opener>
                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>PERCEIVING you particularly deſirous to know how I paſs my time in Pembrokeſhire, I here preſent you with particulars of my proceedings in a progreſs I lately made to a gentleman's houſe, purely to procure a plan of it.</p>
                  <p>I proceeded in a party of pleaſure with Mr. Pratt of Pickton Caſtle, Mr. Powell of Penally, and Pugh of Purley, to go and dine with Mr. Pritchard of Poſtmain; which was readily agreed to, and ſoon put in practice. However, I thought it a proper precaution to poſt away a perſon privately to Mr. Pritchard's, that he might provide for us; and we proceeded after him. The town where Mr. Pritchard lives is a poor, pitiful, paltry place, though his houſe is in the prettieſt part of it, and is a prince's palace to the reſt. His parlour is of a lofty pitch, and full of pictures of the prime pencils; he hath a pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous portico, or pavilion, prettily paved, leading to the parterre; from whence you have a prodigious proſpect, particularly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Percilly Hill, where he propagates a parcel of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0906500201:140"/>and Poliſh poultry. The name of his houſe is Praw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenden, which puzzled me moſt plaguily to pronounce proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He received us very politely, and preſented us with a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful dinner. At the upper-end of the table was a pike, with fried perch and plaiſe; at the lower end pickled pork, peaſe, and parſnips; in the middle a pigeon-pye, with puff-paſte; on the one ſide a potatoe-pudding; and on the other ſide pigs petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes. The ſecond courſe was a diſh of pheaſants, with poults and plovers, and a plate of preſerved pine and pippins; another with pickled podd pepper; another with prawns; another with pargamon for a provocative; with a-pyramid pears, peaches, plums, pippins, philberts, and piſlachi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. After din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there was a profuſion of port and punch, which proved too powerful for poor Mr. Peters, the parſon of the pari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>; for it pleaſed his palate, and he poured it down by pints, which made him prate in a pedantick and pragmatical manner. This diſpleaſed Mr. Price the parliament-man, a profound politician; but he perſiſted, and made it a prolix preamble, which proved his principles prejudiced and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tial againſt the preſent people in power. Mr. Price, who is a potent party-man, called him a Popiſh parſon; and ſaid, he prayed privately in his heart for the Pretender; and that he was a preſumptuous prieſt, for preaching ſuch ſtuff publickly. The parſon puffed his pipe paſſively for ſome time, becauſe Mr. Price was his patron; but, at length, loſing all patience, he plucked off Mr. Price's perriwig, and was preparing to puſh it with the point of the poker into the fire; upon which Mr. Price, perceiving a pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter piſs-pot in the paſſage, preſented the parſon with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in his phizz, and gave him a pat on the pate, the percuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which proſtrated him plump on the pavement, and raiſed a protuberance on his pericranium. This put a period to our proceedings, and patched up a peace; for the parſon was in a piteous plight, and had prudence enough to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to cry— <hi>"Peccavi!"</hi> with a— <hi>"Parce, precor!"</hi> and in a plaintive poſture to petition for pardon. Mr. Price, who was proud of his performance, pulled him out of the puddle, and proteſted he was prodigiouſly ſorry for what had paſſed in his paſſion, which partly proceeded from the provocation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſome of his prepoſterous propoſitions, which he prayed him never to preſume to advance again in his preſence. Mr. Pugh, who practiſed phyſick, preſcribed phlebotomy and a poultice to the parſon, but he preferred wetted brown-paper to any plaiſter; and then placed himſelf in a proper poſition, that the power of the fire might penetrate his poſteriors, and dry his purple pluſh-breeches. This pother was ſucceeded by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; as Mr. Pulteney, the patriot's patent for the peerage,

                     </gap>ades, and the preſumption of the privateers picking up prizes in our very ports, with places and penſions, pains and penalties. Next came on plays and poetry, the picture of Mr. Pope petched on a proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtute, the price of the play-houſes, the pit, pantomimes, prudes, the pox, the primate of Ireland, printers, paupers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, pick-pockets, penſioners, pointers, puppies, and the pranks of that prig the poet lauret's progeny, though his papa is the perfect pattern of paternal piety. To be brief, I propheſy you perceive I am prolix. We parted at laſt, but had great difficulty to procure a paſſage from Mr. Pritcuard: for he had placed a padlock on the ſtable-door on purpoſe to prevent us, and pretended his ſervant was gone out with the key; but, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us peremptory, the key was produced, and we were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go. We pricked our palfreys a good pace, although it was as dark as pitch; which put me in pain, becauſe I was purblind, leſt we ſhould ride plumb againſt the poſts, which are prefixed to keep horſe-paſſengers from going the path that is pitched with pebbles.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Price, who was our pilot, had a very providential eſcape, for his pad fell a prancing, and would no paſs one ſtep farther; which provoked him much, for he piques himſelf on his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. I propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>SCHEME FOR A WHISTLING ACADEMY.</head>
                  <p>WE have often compaſſionated the great uneaſineſs num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of young gentlemen at this day labour under, for want of knowing how to ſpend their time; which ſeems to hang heavy on their hands, being deſtitute of a proper employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To ſee ſo many diſtreſſed mortals ſauntering about from coffee-houſe to coffee-houſe, or from ale-houſe to ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, tiring themſelves, and thoſe about them, muſt certainly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0906500201:142"/>afford a melancholy proſpect to every good natured man living. Read, they cannot; to think, is a taſk more difficult. Unable, therefore, to be one moment alone, they run into any ſort of company that firſt occurs; talking, without ſenſe; laughing, without wit; and by this means become the ridicule of all their acquaintance. In this wretched ſtate, deſpiſed by men, and made the laughing-ſtock of women, they have recourſe to the bottle. With this they regale; and in a ſhort time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt whimſical, impertinen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and rattle-headed, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the world.</p>
                  <p>If this ſpecies of mortals did not think themſelves too wiſe, and too happy, to ſtand in need of advice, or to wiſh a change in their condition, it would certainly be worth while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if ſome eaſy accompliſhment, ſuited to their capacities, might not be found out; the learning and practice of which might ſerve to render them ſupportable to themſelves, and not altogether inſupportable to thoſe who are ſo unhappy as to fall into their bad company.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer both theſe good purpoſes, I can think of nothing ſo likely as their learning to <hi>whiſtle.</hi> It is an attainment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſuited to their genius; equal to their abilities; and, in all likelihood, ſuperior to any of their accompliſhments. I would, therefore, teach theſe untutored gentlemen to apply themſelves inſtantly to the making at leaſt one acquiſition, that may raiſe them to a level with ſomething in the animal creation. If they could but <hi>whiſtle</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides their endeavouring to attain an accompliſhent, that may ſerve as an innocent amuſement, in the midſt of a world where ſo many pernicious ones abound, will be an inſtance of their ſingular virtue, and ſupply the want of thought, which want they ſeem to labour under, in the moſt eaſy or natural way.</p>
                  <p>How happy had it been for young Hazard, if inſtead of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting what he is by no means equal to, namely, the art of gaming, he had applied himſelf to the attainment of this amuſing ſcience! He might then, with a merry heart, have been <hi>whiſtling</hi> for his diverſion; whereas now, he may, in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſoul, go <hi>whiſtle</hi> for his eſtate!</p>
                  <p>If ſome of thoſe creatures, alſo, who call themſelves poets, were wiſe enough to apply their talents to <hi>whiſtling,</hi> they might fairly pretend to ſome ſort of harmony; but now they are not only deſtitute of that, but of every thing elſe that might atone for the want of it.</p>

                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0906500201:143"/>The deſcription of Cymon, in that beautiful tale of Mr. Dryden, has ever been eſteemed a natural and agreeable pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There is ſomething in him ſo undeſigning, that one is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured he muſt be poſſeſſed of an honeſt heart; and cannot help conceiving an affection for him, merely in ſeeing him walk, and hearing him <hi>whiſtle</hi>—

                  <p>How harmleſs is his employment! how inoffenſive his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour! Now, I ſhould be heartily glad to ſee any of our ſauntering fellows make ſo unexceptionable a figure as this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt clown. But theſe gentlemen's want of thought generally leads them into a thouſand impertinences; and, inſtead of learning to <hi>whiſtle,</hi> they are frequently making ridiculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to taſte, learning, or politicks: and there is not a coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in London but will furniſh us with melancholy inſtances of this ſtrange miſapplication of talents.</p>
                  <p>To prevent ſuch fatal miſtakes for the future, I humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a WHISTLING ACADEMY be founded, for the uſe of ſuch gentry, &amp;c. whether young or old, as ſhall be judged pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly qualified to be admitted members of this new muſical ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; contributions for which will no doubt be chearfully and liberally made by the innumerable perſons of reſpectability who are at preſent continually peſtered by the impertinence of ſuch coxcombs.</p>

You ſtill delay giving in your anſwer, which is abſolutely againſt the practice of all the courts. I would willingly quit the fatteſt client there, to attend your buſineſs, would you ſubmit to a reference; and ſhould prefer an attendance at your chambers to thoſe of a maſter in chancery.</p>

                  <head>HEREDITARY DISEASE OF A MENDICANT.</head>
                  <p>DINING lately with a convivial party, a few miles from town, the following adventure happened.</p>
                  <p>The cloth being removed, and the glaſs beginning to circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, a man very ſlovenly as well as raggedly dreſſed, introduced himſelf cap in hand to the company. Surprized at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our hoſt, in permitting ſuch a perſon to intrude himſelf, we were about to call in the landlord for an explanation; when the man undertook to apologize for himſelf, and excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0906500201:145"/>the people of the houſe, who he declared had not ſeen him enter.</p>
                  <p>The ſingular impudence of the fellow, added to the peculiar ſtile of his addreſs, ſo ſuperior to that of the vulgar, excited our curioſity; and we were anxious to be informed of the motives that could induce a perſon of his athletick form, and youthful appearance, to ſubmit to the humiliating and precarious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a common beggar.</p>
                  <p>"An hereditary diſorder, gentlemen," replied he, "which has brought ſeveral of our family to their graves, even before they arrived at my age. I have myſelf been diſcharged as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable from every hoſpital appropriated to my malady. This, gentlemen, obliges me to adopt this diſagreeable method of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a miſerable exiſtence."—"But your complaint?" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied one of the company. "My delicacy, gentlemen," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the mendicant, "will not permit me to diſcloſe the nature of my diſeaſe in ſo publick a manner; but if any gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman will retire with me into another apartment, I doubt not that I ſhall give him ſuch ſatisfaction, as cannot fail to operate in my favour."</p>
                  <p>It was accordingly agreed that a wag of the faculty ſhould attend him into the next room; who, returning in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, exclaimed, with much apparent concern—"Poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low! I do, indeed, recommend him as a real object of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence; and ſhall begin with ſubſcribing a ſhilling for his relief." The fellow then went round with his hat; and, the collection being pretty ſucceſsful, he retired, uttering a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand benedictions on the kind-hearted gentlemen. as ſoon as he was gone, ſome of the company became very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with the young ſurgeon reſpecting the man's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, which it was unanimouſly agreed he was now bound to reveal; and, as he was convinced that the fellow had by this time taken care to ſecure his retreat, he immediately informed us, that LAZINESS was the incurable diſeaſe which had afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this man from his infancy; that he gave him a ſhilling to open the ſubſcription; and that, in fact, we were all bit!</p>

                  <head>INFALLIBLE PRESERVATIVE AGAINST DUELLING.</head>
                  <byline>BY MR. HARRISON.</byline>
                  <p>THE practice of duelling has of late become ſo frequent, that moſt perſons who have any brains to loſe, think it not at all unlikely, if they mix much in what is called polite
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0906500201:146"/>life, that they may ſome day or other be deprived of them by a piſtol-bullet.</p>
                  <p>For my own part, I am one of thoſe old-faſhioned mortals who, being convinced that they have none to ſpare, are deſirous of preſerving what they have as long as poſſible: and this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as my inclinations lead me a good deal into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, has ſometimes ſubjected me to conſiderable difficulties. However, as I have hitherto continued to "ſleep in a whole ſkin," and am now ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rly arrived at my firſt grand climac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terick —an age when it may be ſuppoſed I need not be under any great apprehenſione of being called out—a ſketch of the manner in which I have ſo long preſerved myſelf alike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounded in perſon and eputation—I mean; reputation for cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, all other kinds of reputa ion being foreign to the preſent ſubject—may not be unſerviceable to thoſe who, from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſimilar to my own, are led to mingle with ſociety, but who may occaſionally feel themſelves under ſome degree of conſtraint.</p>
                  <p>A few years ago, when duelling was much leſs faſhionable than at preſent, I happened to be at a coffee-houſe, where two young fellows, both enſigns in the army, ſat diſcourſing of their preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night's pretended amours, in a ſtile of ſuch groſſneſs, and in tones of ſuch vociferation, that the company in general was greatly ſcandalized; and a very decent young woman, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, who officiated in the bar, and for whoſe ear it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent their looſe converſation was peculiarly intended, bluſhed ſo immoderately, and was ſo greatly confuſed, that her ſituation pained me more than I can eaſily deſcribe. I waited a ſhort time, in expectation that ſome man of ſpirit would interfere, for I am myſelf naturally averſe to quarrelling; but, to my ſurprize, though I could perceive the eye, of the whole room were occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the two ſtriplings, and moſt of them with looks of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, when either of the obnoxious parties looked round for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, which they very often ſeemed to do, many of the company were mean enough to aſſume a ſort of grin of approcation, and the reſt, to a man, haſtily turned away their heads. This uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cowardice arouzed me. I felt myſelf bold, and a glow of conſcious ſuperiority animated my cheek. I roſe from my ſeat, and took my ſtation at the fire; facing about to the youths who ſat oppoſite, and eyeing them with contempt. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſternneſs of my viſage ſoon attracted their attention; it had, probably, not pleaſed them before: and one of them, after whiſpering the other, had the audacity to addreſs me with —"Sir, I ſhall look as ſulky as you do, if you continue to ſtand before the fire."—"Sir," replied I, "you are an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent ſcoundrel! and, having groſsly infulted the whole room
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0906500201:147"/>with impunity, you are, I ſuppoſe, beginning to offend every one individually."</p>
                  <p>In an inſtant the heroes were both on their legs; and a ſcene of confuſion and altercation enfued, eaſy to conceive, but impoſſible to be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>It was inſiſted by the companion of him who had affronted me, that I ſhould ſubmit to aſk pardon of the gentleman whom I had denominated a ſcoundrel, or meet him the next day in Hyde Park. He appealed, with great vehemence, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if the word ſcoundrel was proper to be uſed by a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or if any man of honour could tamely put up with the application of it to himſelf. The extorted anſwer was almoſt univerſally—"Certainly not!" And it ſeemed the general opinion that the difference could only be accommodated in one of the ways propoſed.</p>
                  <p>Elated with his ſucceſs, he turned to me with great ſerocity, and demanded to know whether I choſe to make the neceſſary conceſſions, or to meet his friend in the field.</p>
                  <p>"I alike deſpiſe," haſtily returned I, "your friend, and yourſelf: and ſo far am I from acceding to your propoſals, or being convinced that I have beſtowed an improper appellation on your infamous companion, that I repeat, he is a baſe ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel, and that you are as ſhabby a raſcal as himſelf!"</p>
                  <p>His ſword was now out in a moment: and, though I was unarmed, the daſtardly villain actually made a lunge at me; ſwearing bitterly that he would run me through the body, if I did not immediately entreat his forgiveneſs. But I ſnatched, inſtantaneouſly, the poker from the fire, and with a ſingle ſtroke ſhivered his ſword: at the ſame moment driving him to the wall, by thruſting the red-hot weapon cloſe to his face, which appeared evidently pale with fear, notwithſtanding the rubicund reflection of the poker. In the mean time, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion was not idle: but, having likewiſe drawn, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to ſalute me <hi>à poſteriori;</hi> when the company, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving I was more likely to quiet the young ſparks than they had at firſt dared to hope, very manfully interpoſed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the attack in my rear.</p>
                  <p>Having obliged the young gentleman to aſk my pardon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend of my aſking his, under pain of a more intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the ſtill red poker, I turned to the other, who had by this time been compelled to deliver up his weapon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from him a ſimilar apology. He, however, continued obſtinately to refuſe, though every body was now clamorous againſt him, till a ſlight application of the poker to his chin convinced him that I was not to be trifled with, and he alſo acknowledged the impropriety of his behaviour.</p>
                  <p>As I was diſguſted with the profuſion of compliments which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0906500201:148"/>were now beſtowed on my ſpirited conduct by the company, I ſoon quitted the room: and was the next day informed, by a friend, who happened to ſtep in a ſhort time after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eure, that the diſcomfited champions, and all the company, joined very cordially together in cenſuring the groſſneſs of my behaviour, particularly my total diſregard to good manners in the choice of my expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Thus ended a buſineſs, which ſeemed to threaten ſomething more ſerious; for though the young gentlemen proteſted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently that they would have their revenge whenever they ſhould meet with me, they took great care to avoid viſiting every place where it was likely I might be found. Yet theſe youths were ſaid to have actually ſeen ſervice, and to have each killed his man; certain it is, that they had for a long time over-awed the company which uſually frequented the coffee-houſe where I accidentally encountered them, and had totally driven away no inconſiderable number of cuſtomers.</p>
                  <p>It would fill a volume of no contemptible ſize, to recount minutely the various ſkirmiſhes in which I have at different times been engaged; and yet, if I know myſelf, I am as much diſpoſed to treat every one with civility, and as ſtudious in avoiding all occaſions of offence, as any perſon living.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, I am not unwilling to believe that I am conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally what the world calls a coward: for I really have never been able to diſcover in myſelf the pleaſing ſenſation which ſome men of ſpirit ſeem to feel in taking a waiter by the noſe or ears, or kicking a footman's poſterios, for accidentally treading on my toes, running againſt me on entering or quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a room, when I have chanced to ſtand in their way, or any ſimilar offence. I may, on ſuch occaſions, have been prompted to uſe very intemperate language; but I have uſually been afterwards weak enough to think, that my reſentment was even then more than adequate to the crime.</p>
                  <p>But, it will be ſaid—"What has this to do with duelling? There is no danger, at leaſt for the preſent, of being challenged by a waiter or footman!" I am afraid, however, that the ſame iraſcible ſpirit which leads a gentleman to delight in tweaking the noſe of the former, or kicking the breech of the latter, will ſometimes make him ſo far forget himſelf as to take a "wrong pig by the ear."</p>
                  <p>The inference is plain: A man of ſpirit—that is, one who has long enjoyed the ſupreme felicity of ſeeing every one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with fear and trembling—ſuddenly finding a ſtrong oppoſition to his high beheſts, ventures to try the force of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal threats: he challenges his antagoniſt; and, borne up by that enthuſiaſm which is always denominated courage, though it ſhould ſometimes have a very different appellation, he goes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0906500201:149"/>to the field, where he pronably leaves an exiſtence which has too long been offenſive to ſociety.</p>
                  <p>So far duelling may be ſaid to be rather ſerviceable than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to mankind; and, if it always happened that the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor was not the ſurvivor, the practice would be much leſs liable to objection. But for this material property, I believe, it's warmeſt advocates have not attempted to contend.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall, however, avoid entering into the rationality of the cuſtom; of that, every one who has common underſtanding is perhaps full as able to judge as myſelf, and any arguments would be thrown away on perſons of inferior capacity.</p>
                  <p>I have already given ſome reaſons for the ſuſpicion I have ever entertained, that I am myſelf naturally a coward: I really never enjoyed perſonal conteſts; for though, when a lad, I had now and then manual ſtruggles for ſupetiority, and was always for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate enough to prove the victor, I never engaged but with reluctance.</p>
                  <p>This antipathy, however, to deciſions by combat, has never prevented me from giving my ſentiments freely on any ſubject, in whatever company I have fallen; and, though I am not wholly unacquainted with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he art of verbal retreat, it is perhaps the only ſpecies of defence I have ever been afraid of adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>That I have, from the various diſputations in which I have been engaged, received at leaſt twenty challenges, and more than twice as many menaces, will not be greatly wondered at by thoſe who know life, when I inform them, that I have now and then ſat for a whole hour together with young ſunaltern offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers, both of the army and navy; gameſters of all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſpecies; fortune-hunters; men of gallantry; great wits; led captains; and politicians. Indeed, I doubt not, that many young men of the town, who aſſociate conſtantly with ſuch companions, have at half my age had at leaſt double the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>In extricating myſelf from theſe difficulties, I have never once had occaſion to apply for redreſs to the laws of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; though, as they certainly are as well calculated to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the weak, the infirm, the aged, and the meek, from the perſonal inſults of the ſtouter, the younger, and more turbulent, as human ſagacity can poſſibly contrive, I ſhould by no means have felt myſelf degraded by appealing to thoſe inſtitutions, which were planned by our progenitors when national bravery was not at it's loweſt ebb, with much leſs folly and abſurdity than ſeems to be generally imagined by their abundantly wiſe ſucceſſors, had no quicker and equally efficacious remedies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0906500201:150"/>I have conſtantly found, that the moſt boiſterous heroes have been ſoon tranquilized, when they were once thoroughly convinced that a man would not <hi>fight fair:</hi> for though, after poſitively refuſing a challenge. I have been often violently threatened with perſonal chaſtiſement, on my giving the parties to underſtand that I was not very delicate in my choice of weapons, their menaces, which I always treated with the moſt reſolute defiance, were ſeldom attempted to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Once, indeed, a young Hibernian raiſed his cane, which was intended to ſalute my head or ſhoulders; but, on my ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a candleſtick which ſtood before me, he thought proper to defer the diſcharge of his anger, till he met with one who was leſs diſpoſed to make him a ſuitable return.</p>
                  <p>If this method be invariably purſued, with becoming reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will, I apprehend, prove to others, as it has long done to me, an infallible preſervative againſt duelling.</p>

                  <p>I Went home with Philis, the parſon's ſpeckled bitch, laſt Tueſday; and, to my great amazement, I heard the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor declare, that there is actually a ſcheme on foot to tax us poor dogs; the conſequence of which will be, that three parts in four of our ſpecies will be knocked on the head. I profeſs I am not in any dread for myſelf, nor for you, my dear Ponto; for our uſefulneſs will preſerve us, ſince men, though they are by far the moſt ungrateful of all other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, ſeldom chuſe to deſtroy what is of real benefit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I am not, therefore, alarmed out of any ſelfiſh view: no, it is a noble ſpirit of patriotiſm that inflames me; and, though I ſay it, there is not a dog in the nation that will fight more deſperately, or bark louder, in a good cauſe, than your old friend Towzer. Let your ſneaking puppies follow low mercenary views; let them wag their tails at every ſcoundrel, and nuzzle in dunghills for hall a bone; I am a Britiſh maſtiff, and ſcorn ſuch paltry actions. I will venture to ſay, that almighty Love itſelf cannot make me do a little thing; and though I like a pretty bitch as well as another dog, yet it is not in the power of the moſt charming of that bewitching ſex, either by day to make me kill a neighbour's ſheep, or by night to deſert my poſt, and leave my maſter's houſe unguarded.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0906500201:151"/>"But why all theſe profeſſions of honeſty to me," my Ponto will ſay, "who have had long experience of Towzer's worth and imtegrity?" True; but at this conjuncture it is highly requiſite thou ſhouldeſt think the beſt of me, ſince I am about to engage thee in an affair, the ſeriouſneſs and importance of which cannot be too ſtrictly at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore this act will certainly take place, unleſs we can ſtart ſome other ſcheme, from which more cole may be expected. Such a ſcheme I have in my head, but I am ſenſible is not to be brought to bear without thy aſſiſtance.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The family of the Sad Dogs has ever been reckoned, without controverſy, the moſt ancient and moſt numerous of any in the kingdom; if, therefore, they were taxed at the eaſy rate of one ſhilling per head, they would bring in to the government annually at leaſt four hundred thouſand pounds ſterling.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. And laſtly, the Puppies; that is to ſay, the numerous tribe of Fops, Coxcombs, Witlings, Pedants, Poetaſters, Criticaſters, and Grammaticaſters, with many more of that ſtrain, would, at threepence a Puppy, bring in, at an average,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0906500201:152"/>the ſame ſum. So there will be one million two hundred pounds ſterling by theſe means redound from a ſoil which has hitherto brought forth nothing; but has been buried in the weeds of corruption, and the dearth of barrenneſs.</p>

The difficulty now was, who ſhould wait on the king, in his preſent humour, with the grant of the office for his ſignature; a taſk which fell to the lot of Lord Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. As his Lordſhip expected to find the king very little diſpoſed to execute the buſineſs, he prudently took care not to incenſe him by abruptly making the requeſt; but aſked, in accents of great humility, with whoſe name his Majeſty would be pleaſed to have the blanks filled up. "With the Devil's!" anſwered the king, with all the vehemence of paſſion. "And will your Majeſty," coolly replied the Earl, "permit the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to run, as uſual—<hi>"Our truſty and well-beloved Couſin and Counſellor?"</hi> The King, laughing very heartily, immediately put his hand to the appointment, and related to every body the ſucceſs with which the noble Earl's wit had attacked his ill-humour.</p>

                     <l>Her age was neither young nor old;</l>
                     <l>Her features ſtrong, but ſomewhat plain;</l>
                     <l>Her air not bad, but rather vain;</l>
                     <l>Her temper neither new nor ſtrange,</l>
                     <l>A woman's—very apt to change:</l>
                     <l>What ſhe moſt hated was conviction;</l>
                     <l>What ſhe moſt lov'd, flat contradiction.</l>

                     <l>Nought came amiſs—ſhe was ſo wife!</l>
                     <l>For ſhe, bred twenty miles from town,</l>
                     <l>Had brought a world of breeding down,</l>

                     <l>A farmer's wife with ſuch a mien.</l>
                     <l>She could not bear the ſound of dame;</l>
                     <l>No—Miſtreſs Jerkin was her name.</l>

                     <l>She had a vaſt contempt for ſpouſe;</l>
                     <l>As being one who took no pride,</l>
                     <l>And was a deal too countryfied.</l>
                     <l>Such were our couple, man and wife;</l>

                     <l>"Here, Cicely, take away my gun:</l>
                     <l>How ſhall we have theſe ſtarlings done?"</l>

                     <l>They're ſtarlings."—"No, upon my life!</l>

                     <l>I know a thruſh and ſtarling too."—</l>

                     <l>The lye again, and then a blow.</l>
                     <l>Blows carry ſtrong and quick conviction,</l>

                     <l>AS Bacchus, ranging at his leiſure,</l>
                     <l>(Iö Bacchus, king of pleaſure)</l>
                     <l>Charm'd the wide world with drink and dances,</l>
                     <l>And all his thouſand airy fancies;</l>
                     <l>Alas! he quite forgot, the while,</l>
                     <l>His favourite vines in Leſbos' iſle.</l>

                     <l>"The leaves, but hardly born, are red,</l>
                     <l>And the bare arms for pity ſpread.</l>
                     <l>The beaſts afford a rich manure;</l>
                     <l>Fly, my boys, to bring the cure,</l>

                     <l>Through the woods, and down the dales!</l>

                     <l>They bring the dung of ev'ry beaſt:</l>
                     <l>The loads they wheel, the roots they bare,</l>
                     <l>And lay the rich manure with care;</l>
                     <l>While oft he bids them labour hard,</l>

                     <l>The Fauns through every furrow ſhoot,</l>
                     <l>And load their flaſkets with the fruit;</l>
                     <l>And now, the vintage early trod,</l>

                  <p>WHILE the preceding print repreſents the good youth rewarded by the poſſeſſion of a virtuous woman, in the preſent appears the ſad contraſt of his profligate fellow-apprentice aſſociated with one of thoſe wretched outcaſts of ſociety, who diſgrace not only their ſex, but human nature. With this loathſome being, the tenant of a miſerable garret, he is now ſeen in bed. He may be ſuppoſed to have deſerted from the ſea-ſervice, in conſequence of the ſevere chaſtiſement to which his idleneſs, his vices, and perhaps his cowardice—for the moſt profligate are by no means the moſt brave—have there continually ſubjected him. The mode of life which he has ſubſequently purſued, is ſufficiently demonſtrated by the piſtols and other implements of the robber's trade; as well as by the watches and trinkets which form his booty, or rather that of the artful proſtitute with whom he has formed the illicit connection. This wretch, whoſe filthy and diſeaſed ſtate is implied by the gallipot and phials on the mantle-piece, ſurveys with compoſure a rich ear-ring, part of the precious ſpoil; while her paramour, conſcious of the guilt by which it was obtained, and in momentary dread of purſuing juſtice, ſtarts up, petrified with horror, on the falling of ſome looſe bricks down the crazy chimney, over which a cat was paſſing,

The harlot partakes not, like a virtuous woman, in whatever may alarm the man who takes her to his boſom, but conſtantly meditates on the means of attaining the to utmoſt benefit her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. His joys are not her joys, nor his griefs her griefs!</p>
                  <p>Though this print is by no means crouded with objects, every tittle it contains is deſcriptive of the wretchedneſs, and diſorder attendant on vicious life. The precaution of continual apprehenſion, has occaſioned them to barricade the door with planks ſloping from the floor; the ſhattered plaſter demonſtrates the wretchedneſs of the place; the broken-down bedſtead is not without meaning; the hoop, hung over the bed's-head, ſarcaſtically conveys to the imagination what filthy beings may be occaſionally covered with a faſhionable article of dreſs; and the dram-bottle with a broken glaſs, the jug and pipe both likewiſe broken, and the fractured baſon on the mantle-ſhelf, all aſſiſt to diſplay the conſequences of indolence and ebriety. Nor is the moral unaſſiſted by the precipitate retreat of the rat, ſcared at the noiſe, from it's clandeſtine feaſt, on the fragments left in the ſingle plate lying with a knife by the bedſide.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, the whole forms a print of admirable intereſt; and makes us forcibly exclaim, with the poet, that—

                  <head>THE MODERN MAN OF HONOUR.</head>
                  <p>THOSE who attack the fundamental laws of virtue and morality, urge the uncertainty of them, and alledge their variations in different countries, and even in different ages in the ſame countries. "Morality," ſay they, "is local, and conſequently an imaginary thing; ſince what is rejected in one climate as a vice, is practiſed in another as a virtue." And, according to them, the voice of nature ſpeaks as many different languages as there are nations in the world.</p>
                  <p>The dangers and ill conſequences of this doctrine are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; but, ſurely, the falſity of it is not leſs ſo: and the moſt charitable opinion one can entertain of thoſe who propagate it is, that they miſtake faſhion and cuſtom for nature and reaſon. The invariable laws of juſtice and morality are the firſt and univerſal emanations of human reaſon, while unprejudiced and uncorrupted; and we may as well ſay that ſickneſs is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate of the body, as that injuſtice and immorality are the natural ſituation of the mind. We contract moſt of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers of the one by the irregularity of our appetites, and of the other by yielding to the impetuoſity of our paſſions; but, in both caſes, reaſon, when conſulted, ſpeaks a different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                  <p>I admit, that the prevailing cuſtoms and faſhions of moſt countries are not founded on reaſon; and, on the contrary, are too frequently repugnant to it: but then the reaſonable people of thoſe countries contemn and abhor them, though it may be they too wittingly comply with, or at leaſt have not courage openly enough to oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p>The people of rank and diſtinction, in every country, are properly called the people of faſhion; becauſe, in truth, they ſettle the faſhion. Inſtead of ſubjecting themſelves to the laws, they take meaſure of their own appetites and paſſions, and then make laws to fit them; which laws, though neither ſounded in juſtice, nor enacted by a legal authority, too often prevail over and inſult both juſtice and authority. This is faſhion!</p>
                  <p>In this light I have often conſidered the word Honour in it's faſhionable acceptation in this country; and muſt confeſs, that, were that the univerſal meaning of it throughout this kingdom, it would very much confirm the doctrine I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to confute; and would be ſo contrary to that honour which reaſon, juſtice, and common-ſenſe, point out, that I ſhould not wonder if it inclined people to call in queſtion the very exiſtence of honour itſelf.</p>
                  <p>The character of a Man of Honour, as received in the <hi>beau monde,</hi> is ſomething ſo very ſingular, that it deſerves a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0906500201:168"/>examination; and, though eaſier obſerved than deſcribed, I ſhall endeavour to give my readers a deſcription of it, illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated with ſome original pieces, which have luckily fallen into my hands.</p>
                  <p>A Man of Honour is one who peremptorily affirms himſelf to be ſo; and who will cut any body's throat that queſtions it, though on the beſt grounds: he is infinitely above the reſtraints which the laws of God or man lay on vulgar minds, and knows no other ties than thoſe of Honour; of which word he is to be the ſole expounder. He muſt ſtrictly adhere to a party denomination, though he may be utterly regardleſs of it's principles. His expence ſhould exceed his income conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; not for the neceſſaries, but for the ſuperfluities of life; that the debts he contracts may do him Honour. There ſhould be a haughtineſs and inſolence in his deportment, which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reſult from conſcious Honour. If he be cholerick, and wrong-headed into the bargain, with a good deal of animal courage, he acquires the glorious character of a man of nice and jealous Honour: and, if all theſe qualifications are duly ſeaſoned with the genteeleſt vices, the Man of Honour is compleat; any thing his wife, children, ſervants, or tradeſmen, may think to the contrary, notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Belville is allowed to be a man of the moſt conſummate Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that this or any other age ever produced. The men are proud of his acquaintance, and the women of his protection; his party glories in being countenanced by him, and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is frequently quoted as a ſanction for their conduct. But ſome original letters, which I ſhall give my readers, will let them more intimately into the particulars of ſo ſhining a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, than mere deſcription would do.</p>
                  <p>He had run out a conſiderable fortune by a life of pleaſure, particularly by gaming; and, being delicately ſcrupulous in points of Honour, he writ the following letter to his attorney, after an ill run at play—</p>

                  <p>It appears, from theſe authentick pieces, that Mr. Belville, filled with the nobleſt ſentiments of Honour, paid all debts but his juſt ones, kept his word ſcrupulouſly in the flagitious ſale of his conſcience to a miniſter; was ready to protect, at the expence of his friend's life, his friend's wife, whom, by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities that friendſhip had given him, he had corrupted: and puniſhed truth with death, when it intimated, however juſtly, the want of it in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This perſon of refined Honour, conſcious of his own merit and virtue, is a moſt unmerciful cenſor of the leſſer vices and failings of others; and laviſhly beſtows the epithets of Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel and Raſcal on all thoſe who, in a ſubordinate rank of life, ſeem to aſpire to any genteel degree of immorality. An auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward country gentleman, who ſells his ſilent vote cheap, is with him a ſad dog. The induſtrious tradeſmen are a pack of cheating raſcals, who ſhould be better regulated, and not ſuffered to impoſe on people of condition; and ſervants are a parcel of idle ſcoundrels, that ought to be uſed ill, and not paid their wages, in order to check their inſolence.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be imagined how pernicious the example of ſuch a creature is to ſociety: he is admired, and conſequently imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; he not only immediately corrupts his own circle of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, but the contagion ſpreads itſelf to infinity; as circles in water produce one another, though gradually leſs marked out, in proportion as they are remoter from the cauſe of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>To ſuch practice, and ſuch examples in higher life, may juſtly be imputed the general corruption and immorality which prevail through this kingdom; but when ſuch is the force of faſhion, and when the examples of people of the firſt rank in a country are ſo prevalent as to dignify vice and immorality, in ſpite of all laws, divine and human, how popular might they make virtue, if they would exert their power in it's cauſe? And how muſt they, in their cooler moments, reproach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they come to reflect that, by their fatal examples, they have beggared, corrupted, and, it may be, enſlaved, a whole nation!</p>

                  <p>A Dean of Canterbury, remarkable for holding a great number of church-preferments, travelling ſlowly in his chariot to that city, was overtaken by a poor parſon, who had procured the loan of a good horſe. The parſon, <hi>en paſſant,</hi> bowed moſt reſpectfully to the dean; who, deſiring him to ſtop, begged he would call at the Mermaid at Rocheſter; and order him a dinner, to be ready at a certain hour. The parſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly called on the hoſt, and told him that he would be honoured with a viſit at ſuch a time, and muſt provide a good dinner. "For how many, and pleaſe your honour?" ſays Boniface.</p>
                  <p>"Why," replies the parſon, "I can't well ſay how many perſons the whole company will conſiſt of; for I only ſaw the Dean of Canterbury, the Canon of Wincheſter, the Provoſt of Litchfield, the Rector of Orpington, the Vicar of Romney, and one of the King's Chaplains."</p>
                  <p>The parſon then proceeded to his own home, which was within a few miles; and the landlord began to make ample proviſion for the numerous gueſts he expected to entertain. Accordingly, when the Dean arrived, a large table was ſpread, and the cloth laid. "How's this!" cries his reverence; "you have ſhewn me the wrong room!

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0906500201:172"/>indulgence of a fond mother. This unlucky circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance has ſubjected me to many inconveniences; and, as I am a man of a grave reſerved diſpoſition, has been a perpetual ſource of embarraſſment and perplexity.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond day of my viſit, in the midſt of dinner, the eldeſt boy, who is eight years old, whipped off my perriwig with great dexterity, and received the applauſe of the table for his humour and ſpirit. This lad, when he has reached his four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year, and is big enough to lie without the maid, is to be ſent to a ſchool in the neighbourhood, which has no other merit than that of being but ſeven miles off. Six of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are permitted to ſit at table, who entirely monopolize the wings of fowls, and the moſt delicate morſels of every diſh, becauſe the mother has diſcovered that her children have not <hi>ſtrong</hi> ſtomachs.</p>
                  <p>In the morning, before my friend is up, I generally take a turn on the gravel-walk, where I could wiſh to enjoy my own thoughts without interruption; but I am here inſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by my little tormentors, who follow me backwards and forwards; and play at what they call <hi>Running after the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> My whip, which was a preſent from an old friend, has been laſhed to pieces by one of the boys who is fond of horſes, and the handle is turned into a hobby-horſe. The main-ſpring of my repeating-watch has been broke in the nurſery; which, at the mother's requeſt, I had lent to the youngeſt boy, who was juſt breeched, and who cried to wear it.</p>
                  <p>The mother's attention to the children entirely deſtroys all converſation: and once, as an amuſement for the evenings, we attempted to begin reading <hi>Tom Jones;</hi> but were interrupted, in the ſecond page, by little <hi>Sammy,</hi> who is ſuffered to whip his top in the parlour. I am known to be troubled with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent head-aches; notwithſtanding which, another of the boys, without notice given, or any regard paid to the company, is permitted to break out into the brayings of an aſs, for which the ſtrength of his lungs is commended; and a little miſs, at breakfaſt, is allowed to drink up all the cream, and put her ſingers into the ſugar-diſh, becauſe ſhe was once <hi>ſickly.</hi> I am teazed with familiarities, which I can only repay with a frown; and peſtered with the petulance of ludicrous prattle, in which I am unqualified to join. It is whiſpered in the family, that I am a mighty good ſort of a man, but that I cannot <hi>talk to children.</hi> Nor am I the only perſon who ſuffers from this folly: a neighbouring clergyman, of great merit and modeſty, and much acquainted in the family, has received hints to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear coming to the houſe, becauſe little <hi>Sukey</hi> always cries
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0906500201:173"/>when ſhe ſees him, and has told her mamma, ſhe can't bear that <hi>ugly parſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mrs. Qualm, my friend's wife, the mother of this hopeful offspring, is perpetually breeding; or rather her whole exiſtence is ſpent in a ſeries of great-bellies, lyings-in, viſitings, church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and chriſtenings. Every tranſaction of her life is dated from her ſeveral pregnancies. The grandmother, and the man-midwife, a ſerious, ſenſible man, conſtantly reſide in the houſe, to be always ready on theſe ſolemn occaſions. She boaſts, that no family has ever ſent out more numerous adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements for nurſes <hi>with a fine breaſt of milk.</hi> As her long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have of late been in the vegetable way, the garden is cultivated for this purpoſe alone, and totally filled with forward peas, and melon-glaſſes, in hopes that ſhe may luckily long for what is at hand. She preſerves, to the utmoſt the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of frequent pregnancy; and, conſcious of the dignity and importance of being often <hi>big,</hi> exerts an abſolute authority over her huſband. He was once a keen fox-hunter, but has long ago dropped his hounds; his wife having remonſtrated, that his early riſing diſturbed the family unſeaſonably, and having dreamed that he broke his leg in leaping a ditch.</p>
                  <p>I revere Mrs. Qualm as the mother, and only wiſh I could recommend her as the manager, of children. I hope this letter may fall into her hands, to convince her how abſurd it is to ſuppoſe, that others can be as much intereſted in her own children as herſelf. I would teach her, that what I complain of as matter of inconvenience, may one day prove to her a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere trial; and that early licentiouſneſs will, at laſt, mock that parental affection from whoſe miſtaken indulgence it aroſe.</p>

                  <head>HUMOROUS DESCRIPTION OF A CITIZEN AND HIS FAMILY AT VAUXHALL.</head>
                  <p>I Was greatly diverted, laſt Saturday evening, at Vauxhall, with the ſhrewd remarks of an honeſt citizen, whoſe wife and two daughters had prevailed on him to carry them to the Garden. As I thought there was ſomething curious in their behaviour, I went into the next box to them, where I had an opportunity of ſeeing and over-hearing every thing that paſſed.</p>
                  <p>After ſome talk—" Come, come," ſaid the old don, "it is time, I think, to go to ſupper." To this the ladies readily aſſented; and one of the Miſſes ſaid—" Do let us have a chick, papa."—" Zounds!" ſaid the father, "they are half a crown a-piece, and no bigger than a ſparrow." Here the old lady took him up—" You are ſo ſtingy, Mr. Roſe, there is no bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. When one is out upon pleaſure, I love to appear like ſomebody: and what ſignifies a few ſhillings once and away, when a body is about it?" This reproof ſo effectually ſilenced the old gentleman, that the youngeſt Miſs had the courage to put in a word for ſome ham likewiſe. The waiter was called, and diſpatched by the old lady with an order for a chicken and a plate of ham. When it was brought, our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt cit twirled the diſh about three or four times, and ſurveyed it with a very ſettled countenance; then, taking up a ſlice of ham, and dangling it to and fro on the end of his fork, aſked the waiter, how much there was of it. "A ſhilling's worth, Sir," ſaid the fellow.—" Pr'ythee," ſaid the don, "how much doſt think it weighs?"—" An ounce."—" A ſhilling an ounce! that is ſixteen ſhillings per pound!—A reaſonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, truly!—Let me ſee—ſuppoſe, now, the whole ham weighs thirty pounds; at a ſhilling per ounce, that is ſixteen ſhillings per pound: why, your maſter makes exactly twenty-four pounds of every ham; and, if he buys them at the beſt hand, and ſalts them and cures them himſelf, they don't ſtand him in ten ſhillings a-piece." The old lady bade him hold his nonſenſe, declared herſelf aſhamed for him, and aſked him if people muſt not live: the, taking a coloured handkerchief from her own neck, ſhe tucked it into his ſhirt-collar, "whence it hung like a bid," and helped him to a leg of the chicken. The old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, at every bit he put into his mouth, amuſed himſelf with ſaying—" There goes two-pence—There goes three-pence— There goes a groat. Zounds! a man at theſe places ſhould not have a ſwallow ſo wide as a tom-tit."</p>
                  <p>This ſcanty repaſt, we may imagine, was ſoon diſpatched; and it was with much difficulty our citizen was prevailed on
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0906500201:175"/>to ſuffer a plate of beef to be ordered. This, too, was no leſs admired, and underwent the ſame comments with the ham. At length, when only a very ſmall bit was left, as they ſay, for manners, in the diſh, our don took a piece of an old newſpaper out of his pocket; and, gravely wrapping up the meat in it, placed it carefully in his letter-caſe. "I'll keep thee as a curioſity to my dying day; and I'll ſhew thee to my neighbour Horſeman, and aſk him if he can make as much of his ſteaks." Then rubbing his hands, and ſhrugging up his ſhoulders— "Why, now," ſays he, "to-morrow night I may eat as much cold beef as I can ſtuff in any tavern in London, and pay nothing for it." A diſh of tarts, cheeſe-cakes, and cuſtards, next made their appearance, at the requeſt of the young ladies, who paid no ſort of regard to the ſather's remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, that they were four times as dear as at the paſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cook's.</p>
                  <p>Supper being ended, Madam put her ſpouſe in mind to call for wine. "We muſt have ſome wine, my dear, or we ſhall not be looked upon, you know."—"Well, well," ſays the don, "that's right enough. But do they ſell their liquor too by the ounce?—Here, drawer, what wine have you got?" The fellow, who by this time began to ſmoke his gueſts, anſwered — "We have exceeding good French wine of all ſorts, and pleaſe your honour. Would your honour have a bottle of Champagne, or Burgundy, or Claret, or—?"— "No, no, none of your wiſhy-waſhy outlandiſh rot-gut for me!" inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the citizen. "A tankard of the Alderman beats all the red Claret wine in the French king's cellar.—But, come, bring us a bottle of ſound old Port: and, d'ye hear? let it be good."</p>
                  <p>While the waiter was gone, the good man moſt ſadly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he could not have his pipe; which the wife would not allow, becauſe, ſhe ſaid, it was ungenteel to ſmoke, where any ladies were in company. When the wine came, our citizen gravely took up the bottle; and, holding it above his head— "Aye, aye," ſaid he, "the bottom has had a good kick!—And mind how confoundedly it is pinched on the ſides.—Not above five gills, I warrant. An old ſoldier at the Jeruſalem would beat two of them. But let us ſee how it is brewed." He then poured out a glaſs; and, after holding it up before the candle, ſmelling to it, ſipping it twice or thrice, and ſmacking his lips, drank it off: but, declaring that ſecond thoughts were beſt, he filled another bumper; and toſſing that off, after ſome pauſe, with a very important air, ventured to pronounce it drinkable. The ladies, having alſo drank a glaſs round, affirmed it was very good, and felt warm in the ſtomach: and even the old
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0906500201:176"/>gentleman relaxed into ſuch good humour by the time the bottle was emptied, that, out of his own free will and motion, he moſt generouſly called for another pint, but charged the waiter to pick out an honeſt one.</p>
                  <p>While the glaſs was thus circulating, the family amuſed themſelves with making obſervations on the Garden. The citizen expreſſed his wonder at the number of lamps; and ſaid, it muſt coſt a great deal of money every night to light them all: the eldeſt Miſs declared that, for her part, ſhe liked the dark walk beſt of all, becauſe it was ſolentary; little Miſs thought the laſt ſong mighty pretty, and ſaid ſhe would buy it, if ſhe could but carry home the tune: and the old lady ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that there was a great deal of good company indeed; but the gentlemen were ſo rude, that they perfectly put her out of countenance by ſtaring at her through their ſpy-glaſſes. In a word, the tarts, the cheeſe-cakes, the beef, the chicken, the ounce of ham, and every thing, ſeemed to have been quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, till the diſmal moment approached, when the reckoning was called for. As this ſolemn buſineſs concerns only the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, the ladies kept a profound ſilence; and, when the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account was brought, they left the paymaſter undiſturbed, to enjoy the miſery by himſelf: only the old lady had the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to ſquint at the ſum-total, and declared it was pretty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conſidering!</p>
                  <p>Our citizen bore his misfortunes with a tolerable degree of patience. He ſhook his head as he run-over every article, and ſwore he would never buy meat by the ounce again. At length, when he had carefully ſummed up every figure, he bade the drawer bring change for ſixpence: then pulling out a leathern purſe from a ſnug pocket in the inſide of his waiſtcoat, he drew out ſlowly, piece by piece, thirteen ſhillings; which he regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly placed in two rows on the table. When the change was brought, after counting it very carefully, he laid down four half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the ſame exact order; then calling the waiter— "There," ſays he, "there's your damage—thirteen and two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.—And, hearkye, there's three-pence over for yourſelf." The remaining penny he put into his coat-pocket; and, chinking it—"This," ſays, he, "will ſerve me to-morrow to buy a paper of tobacco."</p>
                  <p>The family now prepared themſelves for going; and, as there were ſome ſlight drops of rain, Madam buttoned up the old gentleman's coat, that he might not ſpoil his laced waiſtcoat; and made him flap his hat, over which ſhe tied his pocket-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, to ſave his wig: and as the coat itſelf, ſhe ſaid, had never been worn but three Sundays, ſhe even parted with her own cardinal, and ſpread it, the wrong ſide out, over his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0906500201:177"/>In theſe accoutrements he ſallied forth, accompaned by his wife with her upper-petticoat thrown over her head, and his daughters with the ſkirts of their gowns turned up, and their heads muffled up in coloured handkerchiefs. I followed them quite out of the garden: and, as they were waiting for their hack to draw up, the youngeſt Miſs aſked—"When ſhall we come again, papa?"—"Come again!" ſaid he, "what a pox would you ruin me? Once in one's life is enough; and I think I have done very handſome. Why, it would not have coſt me above four-pence-halfpenny to have ſpent my evening at Sot's Hole; and what with the curſed coach-hire, and all together, here's almoſt a pound gone, and nothing to ſhew for it!"—"Fie, Mr. Roſe! I'm quite aſhamed for you," replies the old lady. "You are always grudging me and your girls the leaſt bit of pleaſure; and you cannot help grumbling, if we do but go to Little Hornſey to drink tea. I am ſure, now they are women grown up, they ought to ſee a little of the world; and they ſhall!" The old don was not willing to purſue the argument any farther; and, the coach coming up, he was glad to put an end to the diſpute, by ſaying—"Come, come, let us make haſte, wife, or we ſhall not get home time enough to have my beſt wig combed out again; and to-morrow, you know, is Sunday."</p>

                  <head>COLLEY CIBBER'S WAGER.</head>
                  <p>CIBBER was engaged in a paper war with Pope; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told one day that Pope intended to proſecute him for making too free with his character, Cibber happened to be in a peeviſh temper, and replied—"He may kiſs my arſe!" On this, one of his friends, who were all on the banter, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it was not language for a gentleman, and that he was ſure that Cibber would not dare ſay ſo to Pope's face.—"By God, Sir," ſays Colley, "I would tell him ſo, or any puppy that ſhould take his part!"—This aſſertion was what they were fiſhing for, as they now perceived that he was in a right cue to be worked up to any pitch. And ſo it proved; for, before they parted, they provoked him to a bett of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred guineas, that he would bid Pope kiſs his arſe in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick play-houſe; bid the company he ſat with kiſs his arſe, let them be who they would; bid box, pit, and gallery, ſeparately, kiſs his arſe likewiſe; and, in concluſion, bid the whole houſe kiſs his arſe all together. This mad wager ſoon got wind; and it was generally known that Pope was to be at the play the next night. When the time came, the houſe was crouded. Now, as it was the beginning of term, the ſolicitor and attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-general
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0906500201:178"/>were both in the ſtage-box, according to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtom; and who ſhould be perched plump between them, but Alexander the Little. Well, Colley had bought the collar, and he was reſolved to go through with it: ſo juſt as the laſt muſick was playing, and the curtain ready to be drawn up, he rang the bell, and puſhed boldly on the ſtage. Cibber bowed, the houſe clapped; he bowed again: all was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thus he began—"Ladies and gentlemen, I have a ſtory to tell you; to which, if you do not honour me with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent hearing, I ſhall loſe one hundred guineas." On this a univerſal clap enſued, and a general cry of—"The ſtory! The ſtory!" He then proceeded thus—"You muſt know, ladies and gentlemen, that there lived in this city an honeſt old tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-maker, who had ſaved a very conſiderable fortune; and, having two ſons, called Kill 'em All and Kiſs my Arſe, he left all his landed eſtate to his eldeſt ſon Kill 'em All, and all his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and ſtock in trade to his youngeſt ſon Kiſs my Arſe. Now it happened, ladies and gentlemen, that Kill 'em All in a few years prodigally ſpent his patrimony; and, what does he do, but ſet up his buſineſs of trencher-making directly under the noſe of his brother Kiſs my Arſe. It is an old ſaying, that two of a trade can never agree, and I am ſure it is a true one; for no ſooner was this oppoſition began, than the two brothers began to hate the ſight of each other; ſo that if they both chanced to be at the play on the ſame night, you would ſee Kill 'em All in the pit, and Kiſs my Arſe in the gallery; or elſe Kill 'em All in the gallery, and Kiſs my Arſe in the pit. Indeed, ſometimes you might ſee Kill 'em All in the pit, or gallery, and Kiſs my Arſe in the boxes. By and by, they got into a paper war; but, as neither of them could write them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they employed ſcribblers on each ſide to do it for them; ſo Kill 'em All choſe your humble ſervant, and Kiſs my Arſe Mr. Pope," bowing to him. "Soon after the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the paper war, they went to law with each other about defamation. Kill 'em All choſe for counſel the Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-General, and Kiſs my Arſe Mr. Attorney-General: no, I miſtake; Kill 'em All choſe the Attorney-General, and Kiſs my Arſe Mr. Solicitor;" bowing occaſionally to both. "At laſt, by the interpoſition of friends, they agreed to ſubmit to an arbitration; and then it was finally ſettled, that, to obviate all ſubſequent diſputes, Kill 'em All's trenchers ſhould for the future be made all ſquare, and thoſe of Kiſs my Arſe all round."</p>
                  <p>This piece of humour was received with great applauſe, and Cibber fairly won his wager.</p>

                  <p>WHILE the purſuits of Thomas Idle, the vicious Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, are conducting him to ignominy and diſgrace, Francis Goodchild, by perſeverance in virtuous and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits, acquires opulence and fame, which render him an object of his fellow-citizens notice, and elevate him to the honour of being choſen Sheriff of London.</p>
                  <p>In this character, the preſent Print exhibits him, ſeated at the feſtive table in Guildhall.</p>
                  <p>Hogarth here gives us a good general idea of a city-feaſt. The principals, that they might be ſeparated as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the burleſque of the ſcene, are judiciouſly kept in the back-ground. The minuteſt figures, however, are charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtically delineated, though the female dreſſes in particular are now become obſolete. The glutton, Time, ſwallows nothing with more voracious expedition than Faſhion; ſhe alone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords him a continual feaſt.</p>
                  <p>The group, in the fore-ground, on the left, is admirably brought forward.</p>

                  <p>While the cooks are buſily engaged, in bringing new ſupplies for the mouth, the muſicians, in an elevated gallery, are ſtill more actively employed in regaling the citizens ear.</p>

                  <p>In the midſt of feſtive ſcene, however, Hogarth has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, at the right corner of the Print, a moroſe Beadle, with all the conſequential inſolence of a beggar in office, holding up and reading a letter, directed to Francis Goodchild, Eſq. Sheriff of London; while at the bar, among other figures, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a ſtrait-haired culprit, whoſe humble ſimplicity preſents a very forcible contraſt.

                  <p>The Motto to this Print, though perhaps not the moſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen, being from the wiſeſt of men, can hardly fail to be good—</p>

                  <head>THE ART OF EAR-TICKLING.</head>
                  <p>HUMAN nature, though every where the ſame, is ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diverſified by the various habits and cuſtoms of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries, and ſo blended with the early impreſſions we receive from our education, that they are often confounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and miſtaken for one another. This makes us look with aſtoniſhment upon all cuſtoms that are extremely different from our own, and hardly allow thoſe nations to be of the ſame nature with ourſelves, if they are unlike us in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; whereas, all human actions may be traced up to theſe two great motives, the purſuit of pleaſure and the avoidance of pain; and, upon a ſtrict examination, we ſhall often find that thoſe cuſtoms which at firſt view ſeem the moſt different from our own, have in reality a great analogy with them.</p>
                  <p>What more particularly ſuggeſted this thought to me, was an account which a gentleman, who was lately returned from China, gave, in a company where I happened to be preſent, of a pleaſure held in high eſteem, and extremely practiſed by that luxurious nation. He told us that the Tickling of the Ears was one of the moſt exquiſite ſenſations known in China; and that the delight adminiſtered to the whole frame, through this organ, could by an able and ſkilful Tickler be raiſed to whatever degree of extaſy the patient ſhould deſire.</p>
                  <p>The company, ſtruck with this novelty, expreſſed their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, as is uſual on ſuch occaſions, firſt by a ſilly ſilence, and then by many ſilly queſtions. The account, too, coming ſo far as from China, raiſed both their wonder and their curioſity, much more than if it had come from any European country, and opened a larger field for pertinent queſtions. Among others, the gentleman was aſked, whether the Chineſe ears and fingers had the leaſt reſemblance to ours; to which having anſwered in the affirmative, he went on thus: "I peceive I have excited your curioſity ſo much by mentioning a cuſtom unknown to you here, that I believe it will not be diſagreeable if I give you a particular account of it.</p>
                  <p>"This pleaſure, ſtrange as it may ſeem to you, is in China reckoned almoſt equal to any that the ſenſes afford. There is not an ear in the whole country untickled; and the Ticklers have, in their turn, others who tickle them; inſomuch that there is a circulation of Tickling throughout that vaſt empire. And if by chance there be ſome few unhappy enough not to find Ticklers, or ſome Ticklers clumſy enough not to find buſineſs, they comfort themſelves at leaſt with ſelf-titillation.</p>
                  <p>"This profeſſion is one of the moſt lucrative and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ones in China, the moſt eminent performers being either
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0906500201:195"/>handſomely requited in money, or ſtill better rewarded by the credit and influence it gives them with the party tickled; inſomuch that a man's fortune is made as ſoon as he gets to be Tickler to any conſiderable Mandarine.</p>
                  <p>"The Emperor, as in juſtice he ought, enjoys this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it's higheſt perfection; and all the conſiderable people contend for the honour and advantage of this employment, the perſon who ſucceeds the beſt in it being always the firſt favourite and chief diſpenſer of his imperial power. The principal Mandarines are allowed to try their hands upon his Majeſty's ſacred ears; and, according to their dexterity and agility, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly riſe to the poſts of firſt miniſters. His wives, too, are admitted to try their ſkill; and ſhe, among them, who holds him by the ear, is teckoned to have the ſureſt and moſt laſting hold. His preſent imperial Majeſty's ears, as I am informed, are by no means of a delicate texture, and conſequently not quick of ſenſation; ſo that it has proved extremely difficult to nick the tone of them: the lighteſt and fineſt hands have urterly failed; and many have miſcarried who, from either fear or reſpect, did not treat the royal ears ſo roughly as was neceſſary. He began his reign under the hands of a bungling operator, who for his clumſineſs he ſoon diſmiffed; he was afterwards attempted by a more ſkilful Tickler, but he ſometimes failed too; and, not being able to hit the humour of his majeſty's ears, his own have often ſuffered for it.</p>
                  <p>"In this publick diſtreſs, and while majeſty laboured under the privation of auricular joys, the Empreſs, who by long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and frequent little trials, judged pretty well of the texture of the royal ear, reſolved to undertake it; and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded perfectly, by means of a much ſtronger friction than others durſt either attempt or could imagine would pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>"In the mean time, the ſkilful Mandarine, far from being diſcouraged by the ill ſucceſs he had ſometimes met with in his attempts upon the Emperor's ears, reſolved to make himſelf amends upon his imperial conſort's: he tried, and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; he tickled her majeſty's ear with ſuch perfection, that as the Emperor would truſt his ear to none but the Empreſs, ſhe would truſt her's to none but this light-fingered Mandarine, who by theſe means attained to unbounded and uncontrouled power, and governed ear by ear.</p>
                  <p>"But as all the Mandarines have their Ear-Ticklers too, with the ſame degree of influence over them, and as this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darine was particularly remarkable for his extreme ſenſibility in thoſe parts, it is hard to ſay from what original titillation the imperial power now flows."</p>
                  <p>The concluſion of the gentleman's ſtory was attended with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0906500201:196"/>the uſual interjections of wonder and ſurprize from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: ſome called it ſtrange, ſome odd, and ſome very comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and thoſe who thought it the moſt improbable, I found by their queſtions were the moſt deſirous to believe it. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, too, that while the ſtory laſted, they were moſt of them trying the experiment upon their own ears, but without any viſible effect that I could perceive.</p>
                  <p>Soon afterwards, the company broke up, and I went home; where I could not help reflecting, with ſome degree of wonder, on the wonder of the reſt; becauſe I could ſee nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in the power which the ear exerciſed in China, when I conſidered the extenſive influence of that important organ in Europe. Here, as in China, it is the ſource of both pleaſure and power; the manner of applying it is only different. Here the titillation is vocal; there it is manual: but the effects are the ſame; and, by the bye, European ears are not always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted, neither, with manual applications.</p>
                  <p>To make out the analogy I hinted at, between the Chineſe and ourſelves in this particular, I will offer to my readers ſome inſtances of the ſenſibility and prevalency of the ears of Great Britain.</p>
                  <p>The Britiſh ears ſeem to be as greedy and ſenſible of titil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as the Chineſe can poſſibly be; nor is the profeſſion of an Ear-Tickler here any ways inferior or leſs lucrative. There are three ſorts: the Private Tickler, the Publick Tickler, and the Self-Tickler.</p>
                  <p>Flatrery is of of all methods the ſureſt to produce that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the air which affects the auditory nerves with the moſt exquiſite titillation: and, according to the thinner or thicker texture of thoſe organs, the flattery muſt be more or leſs ſtrong. This is the immediate province of the Private Tickler, and his great ſkill conſiſts in tuning his flattery to the ear of his patient: it were endleſs to give inſtances of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and advantages of thoſe artiſts who excel in this way.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs of a Publick Tickler is to modulate his voice, diſpoſe his matter, and enforce his arguments, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to excite a pleaſing ſenſation in the ears of a number or aſſembly of people: this is the moſt difficult branch of the profeſſion, and that in which the feweſt excel; but to the few who do, it is the moſt lucrative, and the moſt conſiderable. The bar has at preſent few proficients of this ſort; the pulpit none: the ladder, alone, ſeems not to decline.</p>
                  <p>The Self-Tickler is as unhappy as contemptible: for, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none of the talents neceſſary for tickling of others, and conſequently not worth being tickled by others neither, he is reduced to tickle himſelf; his own ears alone receive any titil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0906500201:197"/>from his own efforts. I know an eminent performer of this kind, who, by being nearly related to a ſkilful publick Tickler, would fain ſet up for the buſineſs himſelf; but has met with ſuch repeated diſcouragements, that he is reduced to the mortifying reſource of ſelf-titillation, in which he commit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the moſt horrid exceſſes.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the proofs above-mentioned of the influence of the ear in this country, many of our moſt common phraſes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions —from whence the genius of a people may always be collected—demonſtrate, that the ear is reckoned the principal and moſt predominant part of our whole mechaniſm. To have the ear of one's prince, is underſtood by every body, to mean the having a good ſhare of his authority, if not the whole; which plainly hints how that influence is acquired.</p>
                  <p>To have the ear of the firſt miniſter, is the next, if not an equal, advantage; I am therefore not ſurprized, that ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a poſſeſſion ſhould be ſo frequently attempted, and ſo eagerly ſolicited, as we may always obſerve it is. But I muſt caution the perſon who would make his fortune in this way, to confine his attempt ſtrictly to the ear in the ſingular number; a deſign upon the ears, in the plural, of a firſt miniſter, being for the moſt part rather difficult and dangerous, however juſt.</p>
                  <p>To give ear to a perſon, implies giving credit, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and being guided by that perſon; and all this by the ſucceſs of his endeavours upon that prevailing organ.</p>
                  <p>To lend an ear is ſomething leſs, but ſtill intimates a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs and tendency in the lender to be prevailed upon by a little more tickling of that part. Thus, the lending of an ear is a ſure preſage of ſucceſs to a ſkilful Tickler. For example, a perſon who lends an ear to a miniſter ſeldom fails of putting them both in his power ſoon afterwards; and when a fine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lends an ear to a lover, ſhe ſhews a diſpoſition at leaſt to farther and future titillation.</p>
                  <p>To be deaf and ſtop one's ears, are common and known ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to ſignify a total refuſal and rejection of a perſon or propoſition; in which caſe I have often obſerved the manual application to ſucceed by a ſtrong vellication or vigorous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the outward membranes of the ear.</p>
                  <p>There cannot be a ſtronger inſtance of the great value that has always been ſet upon theſe parts, than the conſtant manner of expreſſing the utmoſt and moſt ardent deſire people can have for any thing, by ſaying they would give their ears for it: a price ſo great, that it is ſeldom either paid or required; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the numbers of people actually wearing their ears ſtill, who in juſtice have long ſince forfeited them.</p>
                  <p>Over head and ears, would be a manifeſt pleonaſmus, the head being higher than the ears, were not the ears reckoned
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0906500201:198"/>ſo much more valuable than all the reſt of the head, as to make it a true climax.</p>
                  <p>It were unneceſſary to mention, as farther proofs of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and dignity of thoſe organs, that pulling, boxing, or cutting off the ears, are the higheſt inſults that cholerick men of honour can either give or receive: which ſhews that the ear is the ſeat of honour, as well as of pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The anatomiſts have diſcovered that there is an intimate correſpondence between the palm of the hand and the ear, and that a previous application to the hand communicates itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, by the force and velocity of attraction, to the ear, and agreeably prepares that part to receive and admit of titillation. I muſt ſay, too, that I have known this practiſed with ſucceſs upon very conſiderable perſons of both ſexes.</p>
                  <p>Having thus demonſtrated, by many inſtances, that the ear is the moſt material part in the whole mechaniſm of our ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that it is both the ſeat and ſource of honour, power, pleaſure, and pain; I cannot conclude without an earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to all my country-folks, of whatſoever rank or ſex, to take the utmoſt care of their ears. Guard your ears, O ye princes, for your power is lodged in your ears!—Guard your ears, ye nobles, for your honour lies in your ears!—Guard your ears, ye fair, if you would guard your virtue!—And guard your ears, all my fellow-ſubjects, if you would guard your liberties and properties!</p>

                  <head>THE NINE LIVES OF A CAT.</head>
                  <byline>BY BONNEL THRONTON, ESQ.</byline>
                  <p>"HE has as many Lives as a Cat," ſaid a gentleman the other day in company, ſpeaking of his friend, who had run through a perpetual courſe of riot and debauchery, and had juſt recovered from a violent fever occaſioned by his intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. The thought ſtruck me, that too many, indeed, ſeem to be as regardleſs of their preſent exiſtence as if they imagined they could die more than once. I purſued my thought ſtill farther; and concluded, that the greateſt part of mankind, were they even poſſeſſed of as many Lives, we will ſay, as a Cat, would be indifferent to them all; at leaſt, they would wantonly throw away the eight, however careful and ſtudious ſome of them might be to preſerve the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a man, then, to have as many Lives as a Cat: let us ſee what glorious uſe he would make of this extraordinary privilege. Muſt it not be a great incitement to him to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard them repeatedly upon honourable and virtuous occaſions? I grant it: and it muſt likewiſe be granted to me, that they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0906500201:199"/>would equally be laviſhed away upon trivial, diſhonourable, and wicked occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Alexander, had he had nine times Nine Lives to loſe, would have riſqued every jot of them to conquer as many worlds. Let me aſk, whether the King of Pruſſia, or the Marquis of Granby, would not as chearfully run the ſame hazard? But would— and — (O that Engliſhmen could not fill the blanks up!) have done the ſame? Perhaps they might have ventured ſome portion of their precious Lives; perhaps they might have poured out ſome part of the vapid mixture, drop by drop, ſtill careful of the laſt dregs: they, perhaps, like the miſer who plays for gain, might have been tempted to ſtake a little of their fortune; but could never have been prevailed on, like the bold and generous gameſter, to throw for, the whole. They, in fine, would ſcarcely have ſet (to borrow an expreſſion of Shakeſpeare) "even one of their Nine Lives on the hazard of the die."</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, let us take a view of theſe brethren of the blade, to whom the one Life, which is ſparingly beſtowed on us mortals, ſeems ſcarce worth the having. I ſuppoſe it to appear ſo to them, from their readineſs to reſign it themſelves, or to take it away from others, upon any occaſion; or, if you will, (in the Hibernian phraſe) upon no occaſion at all. One inſtance ſhall ſerve for all. Suppoſe there are eighteen Lives between us: I tread upon your toe; ſatisfaction is demanded, and is honourably given by your firing at my brains, which are miſſed. We have Lives enough to ſpare; and you have a noſe leſt for me to pull: I handle it; in conſequence, I fire at your brains, and cannot hit them. What, then, is to be done? Why, nothing is to be done: only you are to kick me; that is all. I turn about, draw my ſword; and, like men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, we muſt each of us loſe one of our Nine Lives before we part friends. I am, indeed, ſenſible, that the punctilios of nice honour would induce the profeſſors of it to aſk this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like queſtion before the engagement—"Pray, Sir, how many Lives have you to loſe?" And there is no doubt, upon a diſparity, that the ſeconds would take care that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals ſhould be ſo far upon an equality, that the longeſt-to-be-liver ſhould be firſt put to death, as often as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, till the combatants were in that reſpect at par.</p>
                  <p>It muſt, undoubtedly, be allowed me, where the antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts are equal, or made equal by the foregoing method, that one or other of the parties would Nine times kill, or Nine times be killed, provided he has reaſon to cry out, with Othello—
<q>
                        <l>"Though all his hairs were Lives,</l>
                        <l>My great revenge has ſtomach for them all!"</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0906500201:200"/>The bravery of a man fighting a duel with himſelf, without ſecond or antagoniſt, vulgarly called ſelf-murder, is frequently manifeſted even in our preſent ſtate of exiſtence, where we have but one Life to loſe. It muſt therefore be granted, on the ſuppoſition of our Lives being multiplied to Nine, that ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide would become a general faſhion among us; though, in eight inſtances out of Nine, it would betray a meanneſs of ſpirit. We ſhould never be induced to believe a man was tired of himſelf in real earneſt, though he had got rid of himſelf ever ſo often, except he fairly ſent himſelf out of the world for the Ninth and laſt time.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe, for inſtance, that a man of quality has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad a run of ill-luck at the hazard-table, to be ſure he would ſhoot himſelf through the head directly. Upon his reviving, he tries his fortune a ſecond time; and is reduced to the neceſſity of running himſelf through the heart. After his recovery, he is obliged repeatedly to make uſe of the ſame, or other methods, that the loſſes of his Lives may be even with the loſſes of his eſtate. Would not this unhaſty behaviour ſhew a love for his precious Lives, ſince he would not put an end to all Nine of them directly, one after another?</p>
                  <p>To prove ſuch behaviour to be quite mean and vulgar, let us farther ſuppoſe that a cobler jerks his awl up between the third and fourth rib—(I kill my heroes with the ſame preciſion as is uſed by Homer)—a barber takes a clean ſtroke juſt under the chin; a taylor "makes his quietus with a bare bodkin:" I ſhall have my ſhoes heel-pieced, my beard ſhaved, and my doublet mended, notwithſtanding. The alluſion is too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous about the end and the laſt: but I hope to be indulged on this ſubject in conſidering my taylor, not without propriety, as only the Ninth part of a man.</p>
                  <p>Many, many inſtances, might be thought of, to evince that a man, endowed with the Lives of a Cat, would get quit of the incumbrance of ſupernumerary ones as faſt as poſſible. Take a lover, for example: without a metaphor, he would be ſo much enamoured as, literally, to die many times for the ſame or ſome other miſtreſs. We will ſuppoſe (what is mere ſuppoſition) a conſtant enamorato—upon the leaſt flight or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, ſuch as a frown, or a box on the ear, my ſwain hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away to Roſamond's Pond: after drowning, he riſes up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably cooled. On another occaſion, he ſurveys the trees in the Dark Walk at Vauxhall, picks out a ſtout branch, and with the leiſure of your true lover's melancholy unties his garters; at the laſt he tucks himſelf up, and dangles till a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py pair comes in his way, and he is cut down. The lady, after all this proof of his affection, is ſtill ſtony hearted. He dies,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0906500201:201"/>and dies on, for her; and, having put himſelf out of eight of his exiſtences, can he be blamed if he reſerves the precious one ſtill remaining for a beauty, or a fortune, or a woman of quality—or his maid?</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe again, (for there can be no end of ſuch-like ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions) that I am an author: my works, indeed, I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, will live after me; but, though I had all the Lives of a Cat, through each of them I might lead the life of a dog. My garret (we will ſay) has inſpired me to ſoar ſo high as to attempt a ſublime ode, or epick poem. I am let down by it's want of ſale. The beam acroſs my chamber is very inviting; and, at leaſt, the bed-cords are remaining. I am afterwards lowered to humble proſe. My publiſher will not afford me ſmall-beer; and I chuſe to have my fill of water by a plunge into the River Thames. After ſinking and ſoaring for eight times alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I at laſt ſit down contented in a gaol, to ſupply copy, ſcrap by ſcrap, as the printer's little imp calls for it; ſince, as the proverb has it, "he muſt needs go whom the Devil drives."</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay very little of the bold methods which bucks and bloods would take delight in to ſhorten their Lives, were they ever ſo many; for theſe are obvious, and continually practiſed, even in the preſent narrow ſpace of their exiſtence. How often would a choice ſpirit, for example, be literally dead drunk; Would he ſcruple to lay his Lives down one after the other, under the table, as long as he could be certain he ſhould riſe up, and ſtand upon his legs again? The debauchee of every character would, doubtleſs, be as haſty to get rid of his load of Lives, as he is at preſent neglectful in preſerving his ſingle one.</p>
                  <p>Upon this principle of each individual enjoying a multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Lives, let us farther conſider, how a nation, or ſociety, or community of them, might exiſt. It may, I know, be urged, that Fielding himſelf, and all the ſitting aldermen put together, would not be ſufficient to ſupport the police. A man, you will ſay, would riſque being hanged eight different times for eight different capital offences, reſolving to be very honeſt afterwards for the remainder of his Lives. Granted. But in ſuch a caſe, it is moſt probable, that the wiſdom of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would direct that a convict ſhould be ſentenced to be hanged, like a Cat, till he were dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead!</p>
                  <p>I went to bed, after having written thus far, reflecting, that no man ſhould be entitled to a ſecond exiſtence—I mean in our mortal ſtate—without having made a proper uſe of the firſt. This reflection was ſo ſtrongly impreſſed upon my
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0906500201:202"/>mind, that T'was able to employ the ſucceeding morning in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the particulars of a dream occaſioned by it.</p>
                  <p>I imagined that every one was indulged with a privilege, after death, of having his exiſtence renewed; but with this reſtriction, that he could prove that he had not forfeited his former Life by not ſetting a proper value on it. I accordingly conceived myſelf in a ſort of court of claims; where a number of us were brought by Death, in order to be examined about our pretenſions to be revivified. The ſight of the crowd ſtruck me with horror: ſome appeared to be covered with blains and blotches; ſome quite emaciated; and ſome with bloated carcaſes. One bore the marks of a tight knot under the left ear; another had his ſcull ſhattered to pieces; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other had a great gaſh in his ſide. Milton's deſcription of a lazar-houſe falls far ſhort of what I then thought I ſaw.</p>
                  <p>Truth and Juſtice were the examinants; and the candidates for a new life underwent a ſtrict ſcrutiny. The firſt that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved was called before them, ſtepped up with a bold air, and claimed a new exiſtence on account of his having died for his country. The plea was not approved of; for a common ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, who had fallen in the ſame battle, depoſed that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhot him in an engagement where the enemy was inferior, at the inſtant that this commander had ordered a retreat. The ſoldier was directly reinſtated into Life.</p>
                  <p>A jolly perſonage was next examined; and he pretended that he was accidentally choaked by a turtle-fin; though the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers had falſely attributed his death to an apoplectick ſit. It being proved upon him that he had dined the day before, and eat heartily upon turbot and veniſon, and that he had drank plentifully of old hock and claret, the court <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecreed that he died of a ſurfeit, and refuſed to indulge him in any more good living.</p>
                  <p>A mere ſkeleton crawled up next, and declared that he only wiſhed to be made alive again for the ſervice of the fair ſex. From his examination it was manifeſt that he had ſpent his life in and about Covent-Garden. He was adjudged, upon his own plea, unfit to exiſt again.</p>
                  <p>The next was an old decrepid figure, ſeemingly worn down with age and cares. His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uit for the renewal of his Life was, in compaſſion to him, rejected; becauſe it plainly appeared that he had already dragged out a moſt miſerable one, and had actually died of want in the midſt of abundance. His ſon put in a petition for his re-exiſtence at the very ſame time; ſetting forth, that he was reduced, by the mean ſpirit of his father, to die an untimely death at Tyburn. The compaſſion of the court in not ſuffering him to live again was alſo extended to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0906500201:203"/>the young gentleman, on account of his tender years; there being little doubt but that he would come to the ſame untimely end, let his Lives be renewed ever ſo often.</p>
                  <p>A blunt young fellow, not leſs than ſix feet high, next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon being reſtored to Life. Another of the ſame make, and for the ſame reaſon, inſiſted upon the like. They had each of them, in the honourable way, put each other to death. It was determined, upon hearing both parties ſeparately, that neither of them ſhould run the riſque of being put to death again, as neither of them would allow that the other deſerved to live.</p>
                  <p>A horrid ſpectacle next preſented itſelf: he moſt earneſtly requeſted to enjoy again that being which, he confeſſed, he had raſhly and deſperately got rid of. His requeſt was not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; becauſe it was certain that the ſame would be repeated upon the ſlighteſt occaſion.</p>
                  <p>I obſerved, in imagination, even ſome ladies of quality, who wiſhed to have their beauty renewed, together with their Lives: moſt of them had died at publick places, where they went for the recovery of their health.</p>
                  <p>My dream was put an end to all of a ſudden, by being my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſummoned up to give a reaſon why I ſhould be glad to exiſt again. I pleaded guilty; and awaked, upon ſentence being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that I ſhould ſtarve again as an author.</p>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0906500201:204"/>Juſtices: but ſince faction hath ſhed it's baneful inflúence, and every thing hath been carried by the current of corruption; ſince party-zeal, and a ready ſubſerviency to miniſterial mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, have been thought the moſt neceſſary qualifications for a magiſtrate; and ſince a lower ſet of people, as being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt for ſuch ſiniſter purpoſes, have been advanced to the ſeat of juſtice, gentlemen of honour and fortune have, in general, not caring for ſuch work, or ſuch company, declined acting. And it is very remarkable that, as within that period the general adminiſtration of Juſtice throughout the kingdom hath ſunk into the hands of a lower claſs of people; ſo, within that time alſo, the power of a Juſtice hath roſe and been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably increaſed.</p>
                  <p>Great power being, on ſuch principles, and for ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, thus lodged in little minds, is it to be wondered at, if many of them ſhould turn Juſtice into a trade; or if ſome of them ſhould be ſo illiterate as not to be able to read? What a droll ſcene it muſt be, and what a fund of mirth it muſt afford, to ſee his worſhip, Auguſtus Peas, ſitting in the chair of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and hear him learnedly diſcuſſing the laws, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding Juſtice! While I was conſidering what a comical farce it would make, and was muſing on the drollery of the ſcene, I inſenſibly fell aſleep; when mimick Fancy, ever buſy, purſued the ſubject, and preſented to me the following ſarce.</p>
                  <p>Methought I ſaw his worſhip, Auguſtus Peas, ſitting in an elbow-chair, at the head of a long table, with a book, pen, ink, and paper, thereon; and a group of people, men and women, attending at the lower end thereof; when his worſhip bade a boy ſtep to the ſtable, and tell John Scrub to come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: John, with his ſhort cropt hair and dirty frock, preſently came in, took his ſeat by his worſhip, and laid hold of the pen and ink. Then Mr. Auguſtus, with great ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſaid—"Maſter Conſtable, what defence hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? What crime hath been diſturbed? And how hath his Majeſty's peas been broke and vindicated?"</p>

                     <p>The Judge, having caſt his eye upon the page, burſt out into a loud laugh; and, with much ado for laughing, acquainted the court, that the law, which Mr. Auguſtus had taken to be againſt frying bacon, was that againſt firing a beacon; which put the whole court into ſuch a loud "Ha, ha!" as awaked me.</p>

                  <head>CURIOUS INVESTIGATION OF THE RIGHT TO EAT. FOUNDED ON PAINE'S RIGHTS OF MAN.</head>
                  <byline>BY SIR BROOKE BOOTHBY, BART.</byline>
                  <p>WHETHER from timidity or prudence, the author of "Rights of Man" has not carried his principles to their fair extent. He has left untouched a thouſand rights neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily flowing from the impreſcriptible and unalienable equality of man in ſociety. The right to <hi>eat,</hi> for example, is at leaſt as natural and impreſcriptible as the right to legiſlate; it is ſomewhat more neceſſary, and of as ancient and divine origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and when dreſſed out in a philoſophical uniform, makes, in my opinion, juſt as good a figure. Man is an organized entity whoſe vitality conſiſts in the action and re-action of ſolid and fluid parts according to the laws of animal motion, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be frequently ſupplied and renewed by the adſcitition of elements taken into the mouth, maſticated by the teeth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitated by the gullet, received into the ſtomach; and there, by trituration, fermentation, and the reſt of the chemico-me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical proceſs of digeſtion, prepared and aſſimilated for the purpoſe of continuing animality; and without which, by the natural and impreſcriptible laws of animation, life muſt ceaſe; the right therefore to <hi>eat</hi> is "one of thoſe natural rights which appertain to man in right of his exiſtance;" "one of thoſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0906500201:207"/>which he muſt retain in ſociety, becauſe the power to execute it is as perfect in the individual as the right itſelf. It is alſo as ancient and of as divine original as that greateſt of all truths the unity or equality of man," and certainly as "advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to cultivate."—"And God ſaid, Behold I have given you every herb bearing ſeed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree on the which there is the fruit of a tree yielding ſeed: to you it ſhall be for meat."—" Here we are got at the origin of man, and the origin of his rights: how the world has been governed from that day to this is no concern of ours; every civil right grows out of a natural right, and <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not invade</hi> thoſe natural rights in which the power to execute is as perfect as the right itſelf." Hence it follows, that the man who appropriates to himſelf a greater quantity of the food given by God equally to all, than is neceſſary for his own conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, acts in defiance of the natural impreſcriptible equal rights of man; and that he who goes into the kitchen or larder of this invader of his natural rights, and ſeizes upon what he wants, acts in ſtrict conformity to thoſe rights which <hi>ſociety cannot invade;</hi> and as to the laws againſt theft or burglary, they are not only in contradiction with the unalienable equal rights of man, but were made by men who having ceaſed to be, have no longer any authority in directing how the government of the world ſhall be organized or adminiſtered. It is the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and not the dead that are to be accomodated; the rights of the living cannot be willed away by the manuſcript authority of the dead!</p>

                  <p>THE ſevere treatment I have conſtantly met with, and the univerſal ſcorn and contempt ſo manifeſtly ſhewn me by all ranks and degrees of men, have ſo ſenſibly affected my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that I once thought of nothing leſs than making a total exit from this ungrateful world. But the kind reception which you—who are well known to be a collateral branch of our family—have lately met with, has ſomewhat raiſed my drooping ſpirits, and encouraged me to ſhew my head once more; though I am ſo worn to a ſkeleton, that the few of my friends and acquaintance who are yet living, I believe, will hardly know me again.</p>
                  <p>When I ſpeak of my own ſufferings, you may, perhaps, be moved with ſome compaſſion, as you reflect on the difficulties you have met with, and the ſeverities you have undergone, though no way comparable to what has become almoſt habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to me.</p>
                  <p>You have, indeed, for ſome years, been under a ſort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription from courts and miniſterial employments: but, at the ſame time, you have enjoyed a comfortable retreat with the few patriots who have renounced all preferments to adhere to you, and have not forſaken your cauſe in the worſt of times: while I have not been only rendered incapable of publick truſt; but, ſuch has been the malice of my enemies, that I am even denied the happineſs of private ſociety, like a criminal branded with infamy. It is become ſcandalous, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mode, to be ſeen in my company, or to entertain the leaſt correſpondence with me; though, God knows, I have always led a blameleſs, inoffenſive life, and am ſo univerſally hated and deſpiſed only becauſe I cannot help people to ſupport the reigning luxury and extravagance, and grow rich all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, without either merit or laudable endeavours.</p>
                  <p>You know the misfortunes which beſel our family at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time; and the deplorable condition I was left in, without any countenance or ſupport, at an age when it could hardly be expected I ſhould ſhift for myſelf. However, I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to endeavour getting into ſome buſineſs for my imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſubſiſtence, and applied myſelf to a very eminent tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the city, requeſting to be taken into his ſervice: but, to my great grief, this firſt attempt proved unſucceſsful. He told me, I could not be of any uſe to him in the retail way; that there was no inſtance of ſuch a one as myſelf ever being behind a counter; and, in ſhort, that he would not adviſe me
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0906500201:222"/>to think of being any way concerned in trade, for that I ſhould not find any dealer fond of employing me, eſpecially as I was a foreigner, and not free of the city. However, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to my wants, the tradeſman had good-nature enough to give me a letter of recommendation to a noted attorney of his acquaintance; who, as he aſſured me, very much wanted my aſſiſtance, and muſt therefore be glad to entertain me on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable terms.</p>
                  <p>This ſeeming friendſhip gave me ſome hopes; and I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went with my credentials as directed, being determined to apply myſelf wholly to that learned profeſſion. I was ſoon introduced; but, to my inexpreſſible concern, met with a cold reception. He ſat lolling in a great elbow-chair, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me with a yawning—"What is your name, Sir?"— "Common Honeſty, Sir," I replied. "Com—mon Hon—eſty!" cries he, yawning again; "I have read the letter you brought, but am ſure Common Senſe never fent you hither: I cannot, by any means, receive you into my houſe; you can be of no manner of uſe to me in my branch of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: all the imaginary ſervices you may do, will never bear the expence of your maintenance, for I cannot employ you in one cauſe in twenty; if I ſhould, I might be in danger of loſing many clients, who would naturally ſuſpect your betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſecrets; and if they were once to know I have any dealings with you, it would blaſt my character. Beſides," adds he, "young man, were I minded to bear with all theſe inconveniences, at the requeſt of my friend who recommended you to me, you would never find the practice of the law turn to any account for yourſelf: you are ſo odious among thoſe of our profeſſion, that it is a great queſtion with me whether you would ever be admitted as an attorney; but if you ſhould, how will you live? Who the Devil do you think will employ you? Moſt people will be afraid of truſting their buſineſs in your hands. Therefore, I would adviſe you to turn your thoughts to ſome other profeſſion; and, if you can do nothing better, get yourſelf ordained: you ſurely cannot be obnoxious to the clergy; they will, at leaſt, give you ſuch outward counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that you will never want a reaſonable ſupport and maintenance."</p>
                  <p>Finding this ſolid reaſoning would bear no contradiction, and being thoroughly convinced I had miſtaken myſelf greatly in this ſecond attempt, I maturely conſidered the wholeſome advice given me, and began to form ſome method of putting it in execution; and, in effect ſoon thought of a perſon I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined very proper for my purpoſe: and who ſhould this be, but a certain Right Reverend; who, when young, had great
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0906500201:223"/>obligations to our family, in recommending him to his firſt preferment in the church; the remembrance of which, I hoped, would eſtabliſh me in his favour.</p>
                  <p>I attended him one morning early, and waited an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could be-admitted to an audience; when, my patience being almoſt worn out, on a ſudden the word was given for the ſtranger to come in to my lord. I immediately entered, and paid my reſpects to his lordſhip in a moſt ſubmiſſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. "How do you do, young man?" ſays the prelate: "I have not ſeen you a great while; I thought you was dend, or gone abroad. And pray what has brought you hither now?" I gave him the beſt account I could of my paſt misfortunes, and preſent unhappy caſe; and, while I was employing all my rhetorick to move his pity and compaſſion, his lordſhip was reading, which inattention to my requeſt gave me little hopes of ſucceſs. At laſt, he ſuddenly laid down his book, and turned up his head towards the cieling—for I remarked he could not look me in the face, and therefore I inferred he was aſhamed to ſee me—and then ſpoke thus—" You talk of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have had to your family; I know of none: ſome little civilities, indeed, paſſed between me and them at college, when your father officiouſly thruſt himſelf upon me as a tutor, and to direct me in my firſt ſetting out in the world: but if I had truſted to his judgment, underſtanding, or credit, I might have remained at college ſtill." And then he declared, he knew of no obligations he had to any one belonging to me; ſo that he could not, in any ſort, intermeddle in my affairs, which he thought very incompatible with his ſtation, and might be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to his farther advancement; and wiſhed me to provide for myſelf in the beſt manner I could: "For," added he, "you may reſt aſſured, you will have no aſſiſtance from me."</p>
                  <p>From the example of this Right Reverend, and the diſcourſe I had with others of what paſſed at this interview, I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſatisfied that, for the want of intereſt at court, which I knew myſelf to be wholly unprovided of, there were little hopes of preferment in this road, even if I ſhould get ordained: the utmoſt to be expected was ſome poor Welſh living, or a ſtarving curacy in town. Theſe re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lections, and the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I had, ſoon weaned me of all thoughts of dedicating my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſervice of the church.</p>
                  <p>Having now tried: three different methods for my advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I found impracticable, I knew not well what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject next to fall on. In this ſtate of uncertainty my wants daily increaſed, which brought me almoſt to deſpair. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I walked out one morning and by accident met with a recruiting-ſerjeant. I bethought myſelf the army refuſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0906500201:224"/>and therefore, ſince I could do no better, was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to liſt for a ſoldier. I called the ſerjeant aſide, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered myſelf to his diſpoſal; telling him, at the ſame time, as is uſual in like caſes, my name and place of birth. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, inſtead of greedily embracing the offer, ſtood ſome time in ſuſpenſe, ſcratching his forehead; and at laſt ſaid—" I am afraid, my lad, you will never learn the military dicipline, or make any figure in the field: and, ſhould you liſt in our regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; you will be very troubleſome, both on march, and in quarters; for no comrade will care to meſs with you. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as our captain is in great want of men, I will venture to introduce you."</p>
                  <p>We went away directly to the captain's quarters; where the ſerjeant having told our buſineſs, and I having anſwered the ſame queſtions as before, our noble captain ſhook his head, and ſaid, I might perhaps be fit for ſea-ſervice, but that I was not of a proper ſize for his company; and then demanded of the ſerjeant where he picked me up, and how he came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with me. The ſerjeant replied, with great truth, that he never ſaw or heard of me before in his life, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally met me a little while ago. "Send him packing then," cries the captain: "this fellow would make a mutiny in the regiment; beſides, I know all his family are diſaffected to the preſent eſtabliſhment in church and ſtate, and therefore I would not take him on any conſideration."</p>
                  <p>My evil genius ſtill purſuing me, I had recourſe to another expedient. I remembered my father, in his life-time, had a place in the Treaſury, which he enjoyed till the death of his patron, a great man who preſided at that board, by which means I had ſome little inſight into the buſineſs of that office; and therefore I had no more wit than to fancy I might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his ſucceſſor. I made, indeed, but a plain appearance as to dreſs; however, I reſolved to equip myſelf in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I could, attend next morning at his levee, and try my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune once more.</p>
                  <p>On my arrival at his door, whether I was deſpiſed for not being a beau, or for not coming in a coach, or whether I was taken for a Scotch lord juſt come to town with my own wants and my anceſtors merits, I cannot ſay; but, to my great ſur-prize, Abraham Braſs, the porter, told me his maſter was not at home. This I knew to be falſe, and therefore would have gone in notwithſtanding, but Abraham ſhut the door in my face.</p>
                  <p>I could not imagine the cauſe of this treatment, being ſure the fellow did not know me; however, having time to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect myſelf a little, till opportunity offered, by opening the door
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0906500201:225"/>for ſomebody's going out, I accoſted Abraham very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly— "Sir," ſays I, "you have inſulted me without any provocation; I muſt deſire to be admitted:" and told him my name, and the buſineſs I had with his maſter; who, I knew, often valued himſelf on his intimacy with my family. But, alas! I only made bad worſe; he fell furiouſly upon me in the moſt opprobrious language imaginable; called me all the raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals and ſcoundrels he could think on; ſwore I ſhould never enter the doors while he was porter, and that I only came there with ſome wicked deſign on his perſon, or to rob the houſe; and that, if I did not inſtantly depart and be gone, he would charge a conſtable with me, and ſwear the peace againſt me.</p>
                  <p>On this outrage I thought it proper to retire ſome diſtance from the door, where I took the opportunity, as ſeveral well-dreſſed gentlemen were going in, to tell them my caſe, with the abuſe I met with from Abraham; begging of them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his honour with the behaviour of his ſervant. But not a ſingle word could I get out of one of them: ſome ſhook their heads, and others ſtarted from me as if I had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. At laſt, a grave, elderly gentleman, with a bundle of papers in his hands, going into the great man's, ſtopped a little to hear my complaints, and was ſo kind as to open his mouth. "I have," ſays he, "Sir, ſome ſmall knowledge of your family, with whom I was acquainted before I came into a publick employment: but what buſineſs have you here? Complaining of Abraham Braſs's behaviour will be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: he knows his maſter's mind, to whom he ought to be civil, and whom he may be rude to; and, depend upon it, you are ſo univerſally hated by the whole family, whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt it is that you ſhould never come within theſe doors, that you are not ſafe in ſtaying longer ſo near them, leſt a worſe evil befal you: nay, I do not know, if it were ſuſpected I now ſpeak to you in ſo friendly a manner, but it might be as much as my place is worth; therefore I adviſe you to make off as faſt as poſſible."</p>
                  <p>By this time, kinſman, you may ſuppoſe I was in a very melancholy condition: when I happened to meet with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gentleman; who, without any heſitation, on the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of my circumſtances, took me into his ſervice, and entertained me at his country-ſeat with great kindneſs and humanity. He entruſted me with the management of all his affairs, and adviſed with me on the moſt important tranſactions of his life. In this ſituation, I looked back on the miſery of my former condition with joy and ſatisfaction, changed for the preſent; and, being arrived at the bounds of my ambition,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0906500201:226"/>peace and content, deſpiſed all worldly greatneſs with the ſpirit of a philoſopher.</p>
                  <p>But as nothing in this world is permanent, the devil put it into my lady's head to live in town; and that my maſter might not oppoſe her deſign, from the expences attending the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval; ſhe perſuaded him to offer himſelf as a candidate for the late election in a neighbouring borough, from the ſucceſs of which ſhe imagined great preferments would be had for the whole family. The ſcheme was reſolved on; and I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſpatched away to the place of election, as one my maſter conſided in, to make timely intereſt, he intending to follow me in a few days. I ſet out on this errand with no very good will, foreboding my own deſtruction in the event: and when I came to my journey's end, I met with as little ſucceſs. The electors, one and all, took a mortal antipathy to me at firſt ſight; and, inſtead of ſecuring their friendſhip, I made every one of them my enemy: and, on my maſter's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, they inſiſted I ſhould be forthwith diſcharged, or he muſt not expect one vote there. My maſter's eagerneſs to ſucceed in this election tempted him to comply. Immediately I was diſmiſſed, with a private intimation that, though I was uſeleſs in an election, yet if I went to town; and waited with patience, I ſhould be taken in again for the management of my maſter's private affairs. I knew no remedy but ſubmiſſion. I went off as privately as I could; and, ſoon after my maſter's arrival in town, I waited on him in hopes of what I expected being performed. But never was a man ſo changed as my maſter: he told me, to my great grief and ſurprize, that he had no farther ſervice for me of any kind, being now engaged to take other meaſures than when he lived retired in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that he was firmly reſolved never again to be under the reſtraint of any other ſervant; that his election coſt him a deal of money for a double return, and all would be loſt if he did not play his cards well; and, being under a ſolemn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement never to have any the leaſt correſpondence with me, he concluded with forbidding me his houſe.</p>
                  <p>Having thus, loving kinſman, tried all reaſonable methods of getting a livelihood, and having at preſent no means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, my application, which is the laſt I ſhall make, is to you; and, finding you have ſet up a new work, my humble requeſt is to be taken into your ſervice.</p>
                  <p>There has formerly been a ſtrict union and friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two branches of our family, Common Senſe and Common Honeſty; though I own yours to be of ſuperior rank and dignity, having ſupplied the world with many kings and queens. But, though we have not arrived to that honour,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0906500201:227"/>you have found us uſeful in our ſtation; and it can be proved by many inſtances in hiſtory, that Common Senſe never flouriſhed, or made any conſiderable figure, without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Common Honeſty.</p>
                  <p>I know the difficulties of my own condition, and how hard it is, unſupported, to make my way through the world: but as we have ſo often contributed to your ſupport, and none of your anceſtors ever met with any material check or misfortune while our branch of the family was countenanced by them; therefore, as we fell, ſo I hope we ſhall riſe together.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſuſpect you will ever write for the miniſtry, in which caſe I know I ſhall be entirely uſeleſs to you; the only favour I aſk is ſome employment under you in the mean time, which will be gratefully acknowledged by your affectionate kinſman,</p>

                  <head>THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF MONSIEUR DE JARDIN.</head>
                  <p>THE Count De Montalto ſent Monſieur De Jardin, one of his gentlemen, to Naples, with five hundred piſtoles, to buy horſes; and, being arrived there, as he was ſtanding the next evening in the gate of the inn, throwing his purſe of gold from one hand to the other, he was obſerved by a young courtezan, who wanted neither wit nor beauty: the next morning ſhe ſent one of her ſpies privately to enquire who the object of her attention was, his buſineſs, and what other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances related to him, or could be of advantage to her deſign. Being informed of particulars whereon to found her plot, ſhe diſpatched one of her emiſſaries, a cunning gipſey, to acquaint him, that a lady of quality, and a relation of his, entreated the favour of a viſit. The crafty decoy hovered at a diſtance, till De Jardin came out; who, as was his cuſtom, ſtanding at the gate alone, ſhe, with a modeſty as counterfeit as her innocence, aſked if Monſieur De Jardin was within. "Yes, my ſweet girl," ſays he, "I am the perſon."—" Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior," ſays ſhe, "my lady commands me to let you know ſhe has the honour to be related to you; and, if it is not too great a condeſcenſion, ſhe begs you would ſpare half an hour from your more important affairs, and beſtow it on her." De Jardin was not much ſurprized at ſo obliging an invitation; for, though he knew of none of his relations, who either to bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e the title of lady, or even lived in Naples; yet, preſuming on the comelineſs of his perſon and good mien, he imagined it was ſome lady of quality who was enamoured of him, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0906500201:228"/>with this pretence courted an opportunity to diſcover her paſſion. "Madam," ſays he, "I could wiſh myſelf worthy of ſo great a bleſſing as I now receive; and, ſince a ready ſubmiſſion to your lady's commands is the beſt proof I can give of my zeal and affection to her ſervice, I will this very minute pay my reſpects to her." De Jardin, without going into his lodging, went directly along with his guide; who led him through ſeveral croſs ſtreets and bye-ways, till they came to the houſe, which in the front appeared fair and reputable: at the door a perſon attended, who conducted De Jardin into a room richly furniſhed both for pleaſure and taſte. As ſoon as the lady was acquainted that Monſieur de Jardin was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſhe deſcended with a portly and majeſtick grace; which, leſt it ſhould ſtrike too great an awe upon her kinſman, ſhe ſweetened with an affectionate familiarity and reſpect. The wily courtezan ſpread her net ſo well, that his dull eye could not diſcover the leaſt deceit; ſhe diſplayed his pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with ſo much artifice, that his obſcure family was now derived from one of the moſt noble houſes of all Italy, of which ſhe had the honour to be no inconſiderable branch; all which his pride and folly eaſily credited. Variety of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, with mutual congratulations for ſo happy an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, had now ſpent a good part of the evening; when the lady was whiſpered in the ear that ſupper was ready. She ordered it to be brought in; and though it was ſplendid and elegant, ſhe courteouſly pretended to excuſe it as not good enough for ſo worthy a gueſt. Supper being over, De Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din recollecting it grew late, and that he was a ſtranger to the ſtreets, was ready with a long harangue of thanks to take leave of ſo honourable a kinſwoman. A profuſion of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were mutually exchanged; when, taking him by the hand, "Nay, couſin," ſays ſhe, "though I am ſenſible your reception has not been equal to your merit, yet I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that my houſe can afford you better accommodations than your inn; and if you rob me of your company to-night, you have not that eſteem for me I am ſo ambitious of." De Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din, whoſe better genius was abſent, accepted the invitation.</p>
                  <p>It ſoon grew bed-time, and De Jardin was attended to his apartment by the lady and two of her ſervants; who, after a ſolemn "Good night!" withdrew. As he was ſtepping into bed, the wine he had drank began to rumble in his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; for it had been phyſically prepared for that purpoſe: he therefore aſked one of the ſervants for a neceſſary conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and was directed into a little room adjoining: his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs required haſte. Boldly ſtepping in, a board, which lay purpoſely looſe, gave way, and down he fell to the bottom of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0906500201:229"/>the privy. As ſoon as he had recovered himſelf from the fright—for hurt he received none, except from what was tranſacting above—he cried out for help; but nobody an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, though he heard his kinſwoman's voice very merry and loud: they were too buſy in ranſacking his pockets, where they found the prize they wanted, with bulk unbroken. In this diſtreſs, he diſcovered a wall which communicated with the ſtreet; this he endeavoured to ſcale, but with repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlips mired himſelf over head and ears. At laſt, however, he ſucceeded, and found himſelf in the middle of the ſtreet. By the light of the moon he gueſſed at the houſe, and rung ſo loud a peal at the door, that a grim fellow opened a window, and aſked what drunken knave gave that unmannerly alarm? "I am, Sir," ſays he, "the lady's couſin."—"Sirrah," ſays he, "you are an impudent liar! I know no ſuch perſon. Be gone in time, or you will too late repent this ſaucy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front." The approach of the watch at this inſtant forced De Jardin to break off the dialogue, and ſecure himſelf. As he was looking for a place of ſhelter, he ſpied an open bulk, where in the day-time a cobler and an herbwoman kept their ſhop; into which he crept as far as he could, to conceal himſelf till the watch was gone by. Three fellows, who that night deſigned to rob the tomb of a cardinal who had lately been buried in the great church, having hid their tools in this bulk, now came for them. De Jardin, hearing men talk, lay cloſe; but one of them groping for the implements, and often complaining of a horrible ſmell, at laſt catched De Jardin by the leg. The ſurprize was equal on both ſides; however, the fellow had the courage to pull him out, and examine what ſort of a creature lay concealed there. De Jardin's ſhirt was ſo offenſive, that they forced him to ſtrip; for, conſidering he might be of uſe to them in their preſent deſign, and had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly overheard ſome of their diſcourſe, they compelled him to go along with them. Notwithſtanding he was now as naked as he was born, yet the filth was thick cruſted upon his ſkin, and the ſmell ſo noiſome, they could not endure it. For this one of them thought of a proper remedy: hard by, there was a deep well, with a long chain and a bucket at the end of it; hither they brought De Jardin, put him into the bucket, let him down into the well, and told him that, as ſoon as he had waſhed himſelf clean, he muſt ſhake the chain, and they would draw him up. While they ſtayed for De Jardin, the watch came, it being very hot, to refreſh themſelves with water, the only beverage that could be had at that hour. His companions were now forced to run and hide; and the watch laid down their cloaks and halberts, and drew up the bucket. De Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0906500201:230"/>with a ſudden ſpring leaped aſhore, which ſtruck ſuch a panick upon them, that they fled, leaving the pillage of the field, their cloaks and halberts, to De Jardin and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades. Having now joined company again, they went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the cardinal's tomb, and raiſed up the heavy marble: but a diſpute aroſe who ſhould go in. De Jardin would not. "No," ſays one of them; "wont you? but you ſhall: what did we bring you here for elſe?" They ſoon forced De Jardin to deſcend; and he reached them out the mitre and croſier, and pulled off the cardinal's gold fringe gloves, which were richly embroidered. He had heard them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a diamond-ring of great value; and this he ſlipt off, and put upon his own finger, to ſecure ſomething in caſe of the worſt. They ſtill bade him look for the ring: he told them he could find none; and they muſt come in, if they either ſuſpected his honour or honeſty, and look for it themſelves. "I am ſure," ſaid one, "it was ſaid he had a very rich ring; feel upon the other hand." As they were thus argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe, they heard a ſudden noiſe in the church; which they ſuſpected might be ſome of the officers: this frightened them ſo, that away they ran, and let the ſtone fall down, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor De Jardin entombed with the dead cardinal. This was a misfortune a thouſand times worſe than any that had yet befallen him: it was impoſſible for him to raiſe up the ſtone, and if he made a noiſe to diſcover himſelf, he would certainly be executed for ſacrilege and robbing the dead; and to lie there and ſtarve, or be poiſoned with the ſtench of the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing body, was ſtill more dreadful. It happened that the noiſe which frightened his companions proceeded from ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then breaking into the church upon the ſame deſign: when they came to the tomb, they raiſed up the marble, ſtrongly under-propped it, and began, like the others, to diſpute who ſhould deſcend. "What," ſays one of them, a bold fellow, "are you afraid the dead cardinal ſhould bite you? Let me come!"</p>
                  <p>As he was letting himſelf down, De Jardin catched faſt hold of his legs; the fellow, frightened out of his wits, cried out, "Help! help! the cardinal has catched me by the legs!" and, ſtruggling, got out, and followed his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; who, every ſtep they made, expected the cardinal would ſeize them. This gave De Jardin an opportunity of eſcaping. He immediately quitted the church by the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me way he had entered it; and, cloathed with one of the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's cloaks, walked about till morning. When it was light, he enquired out his inn; where he borrowed ſome cloaths, and gave a terrible detail of his misfortunes—but not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0906500201:231"/>a word of the ring.

                  <head>THE ARCHBISHOP'S LUCK. AN ODD ADVENTURE.</head>
                  <p>AN archbiſhop of Canterbury, making a tour into the country, ſtopped at an inn for refreſhment. Being at the window, he obſerved at a diſtance, in a ſolitary wood, a well-dreſſed man alone, talking, and acting a kind of part. The prelate's curioſity was excited to know what the ſtranger was about; and, accordingly, he ſent ſome of his ſervants to obſerve him, and hear what he was rehearſing: but they bringing him back an anſwer no way ſatisfactory, his Grace reſolved to go himſelf. He accordingly repaired to the wood, ordering his attendants to remain at a diſtance. He addreſſed the ſtranger very politely, and was anſwered with the ſame civility. A converſation having been once entered into, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruptions by an occaſional ſoliloquy, his Grace aſked what he was about. "I am at play," he replied. "At play!" ſaid the prelate; "and with whom? You are all alone."—"I own," ſaid he, "Sir, you do not perceive my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt; but I am playing with God!"—His lordſhip thinking the man out of his mind, replied—"This is a very extraordinary party: and pray at what game, Sir, are you playing?"—"At cheſs, Sir." The archbiſhop ſmiled; but the man ſeeming peaceable, he was willing to amuſe himſelf with a few more queſtions. "And do you play for any thing, Sir?"—"Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly." —"You cannot have any great chance, as your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary muſt be ſo ſuperior to you."—"He does not take any advantage, but plays merely like a man."—"Pray, Sir, when you win or loſe, how do you ſettle your accounts?"—"Very exactly and punctually, I promiſe you."—"Indeed! Pray how. ſtands your game?" The ſtranger, after muttering ſomething to himſelf, ſaid—"I have juſt loſt it."—"And how much have you loſt?"—"Fifty guineas."—"That is a great ſum; how do you intend paying it? Does God take your money?" —"No; the poor are his treaſurers: he always ſends ſome worthy perſon to receive the debt; and you are, at preſent, the purſe-bearer." Saying this, he pulled out his purſe; and, reckoning fifty guineas, put them into his Grace's hand, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, ſaying he ſhould play no more that day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0906500201:232"/>The prelate was quite faſcinated; he did not know what to make of this extraordinary adventure: he viewed the money; found all the guineas good; recalled what had paſſed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think there muſt be ſomething more in this man than he had diſcovered. However, he continued his j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urney, and applied the money to the uſe of the poor, as had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
                  <p>On his return, he ſtopped at the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me inn; and, perceiving the ſame perſon again in the wood, in his former ſituation, he reſolved to have a little farther converſation with him; and went alone to the ſpot where he was. The ſtranger was a comely man; and the prelate could not help viewing him with a kind of religious veneration: thinking, by this time, that he was inſpired to do good in this uncommon manner. The prelate accoſted him as an old acquaintance, and familiarly aſked him how the chance had ſtood ſince they had firſt met. "Sometimes for me, and ſometimes againſt me; I have both loſt and won."—"And are you at play now?"—"Yes, Sir; we have played ſeveral games to-day."—"And who wins?" —"Why, Sir, at preſent, the advantage is on my ſide; the game is juſt over; I have a ſine ſtroke; check mate, there it is."—"And pray, Sir, how much have you won?"—"Five hundred guineas."—"That is a handſome ſum; but how are you to be paid?"—"I pay and receive in the like manner: he always ſends me ſome good rich man when I win; and you, my Lord, are the perſon. God is remarkably punctual on theſe occaſions."</p>
                  <p>The archbiſhop had received a conſiderable ſum that very day; the ſtranger knew it; and, producing a piſtol, by way of receipt, the prelate found himſelf under the neceſſity of giving up his caſh, and by this time diſcovered the divine inſpired gameſter to be nothing more or leſs than a thief. His lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had, in the courſe of his journey, related the firſt part of this adventure; but the latter part he very prudently took great pains to conceal.</p>

                     <l>The wag ſalutes him with a civil leer;</l>

                     <l>Anxious ſhe ſtrove his errand to enquire:</l>

                     <l>And ſtraight in rage began his creſt to rear—</l>

                  <p>HITHERTO, ſince the firſt Print, we have not ſeen the two Apprentices together. Their purſuits widely varied, and they have been alternately preſented with a moſt forcible contraſt to each other. The intereſt is wonderfully heightened, on this melancholy interview. The victim of Vice, originating in idleneſs, a trembling culprit at the bar of Juſtice; while his fellow-apprentice, as the reward of induſtry and virtue, having attained to the dignity of Alderman of London, is conſequently a Magiſtrate, and has the ſevere but neceſſary duty to perform, of committing for trial the companion of his early days, who is impeached of robbery and murder by the profligate one-eyed aſſociate with whom he commenced acquaintance, by gambling on a tombſtone during divine ſervice. This wretch, who has turned evidence, is ſwearing with the utmoſt audacity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern, to criminate his accomplice; yet contrives, at the ſame time, to do what the vulgar denominate <hi>"cheating the devil,"</hi> by taking the book with his left-hand. This impoſition the priggiſh adminiſterer of the oath, with a pen ſtuck behind his ear, is prevented from regarding by the application of a piece of money placed in the dexter palm, which he holds ſlily behind for that purpoſe. The jade who performs this piece

                  <p>The attitude of the worthy Alderman, while the Mittimus is making out by his Clerk, which is to place his late fellow-apprentice under the care of the Keeper of Newgate, is a noble diſplay of dignified ſuffering.

                  <p>On the whole, this print is moſt exquiſitely impreſſive, and exhibits an intereſting picture of human nature: in which we behold Guilt detected, under all the agonizing horrors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe; and Virtue, with a clear conſcience, feeling anguiſh but little inferior, from the reflection of the ignominy which awaits the companion of his childhood.</p>

In a word, whenever I take up the Spectator, I am ready every minute to break out into the ſame exclamation that a poet of Gaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oigny uttered on reading over a beautiful ode of Horace. "<hi>D</hi>—n
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0906500201:248"/>theſe ancients!" ſays he, "they have ſtolen all my fine thoughts!"</p>
                  <p>Writers of ſuch univerſal talents may draw ſomething that is uſeful and entertaining from the moſt barren ſubject in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Spectator, before-mentioned, has been very learned on dancing. We have had writers, of but a ſecond or third claſs in fame, who have had their excellence: a Baronet of North Britain has publiſhed a large quarto on the Art of Fencing; and a Baronet of Worceſterſhire has obliged the world with a treatiſe of immenſe erudition on the Gymnaſtick Science, or the Art of Wreſtling.</p>
                  <p>But no people come up to the Germans in their indefatigable induſtry for ſearching antiquity. What immenſe volumes of ancient learning have they reſcued from the cobwebs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion! How have they worked through the ruſt, of time, to make diſcoveries for the improvement of mankind! And with what infinite labour have they collected the valuable fragments ſcattered in different authors, on ſubjects of high importance to the learned world!</p>
                  <p>I have myſelf ſeen a hiſtory written by one of the German literati, entitled—"De Veterum Lucernis et Candelabris—Of the Lamps and Candleſticks of the Ancients." It is certain, we ſhould be groping in the dark in ſearch of many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to antiquity, had they not held lights to us. Another, who was as bright a genius as the former, was twenty years in compiling a treatiſe—"De Chirothecis et Ocreis—On Gloves and Boots."</p>
                  <p>I have been credibly informed by travellers, that there is a large folio manuſcript in the Elector Palatine's library—"De Miſeriis Ambulantium—On the Miſery of Walking on Foot;" in which there is a phyſical diſſertation on Corns. There are ſeveral volumes—"De Veterum Cultellis et Furcis—Of the Knives and Forks of the Ancients," written by one Vander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hackle, enriched with cuts; an art that has contributed very much to illuſtrate German wit. What need I mention the great Bamboozlebergius, who has made a collection—"De Mendaciis Antiquorum—Of the Lies of the Ancients?" which work, we hear, is ſhortly to be printed in Engliſh, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and edification of the youth of this kingdom, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great man having taken upon him to patronize it; ſo that I hope every perſon in employment will be obliged to ſubſcribe, under pain of being caſhiered.</p>
                  <p>I have likewiſe been informed, that there has been for ſeveral years, in the publick library at Ratiſbon, a moſt curious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript—"De Colophis et Caleationibus Veterum—Of the Kicks and Cuffs of the Ancients," written by the learned
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0906500201:249"/>Vanhoofius; and that a copy of this work was ſome years ago tranſmitted into England, to be laid up in the Royal Library of St. James's: that it was carefully reviſed and collated by the late learned Doctor Bentley, who has amended an error in the title; for he has proved, that the ſubſtantive Colophis muſt have been an interpolation of the tranſcriber; and, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the true reading is—"De Calcationibus Veterum;" which he tranſlates thus—"Of the Kicks on the Arſe of the Ancients." This ſhews how learning muſt have ſuffered through the ignorance of tranſcribers, were it not for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy of ſuch judicious criticks.</p>
                  <p>To confeſs the plain truth, I had a deſign of writing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on this ſubject myſelf; and have already been at no ſmall pains in looking over the Cotton and Bodleian libraries. I do not know but it will be very well worth while to take a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Rome, on purpoſe to conſult that of the Vatican: but I am a little too much confined at preſent; I therefore beg the aſſiſtance of the learned of both our univerſities, and I hope they will be ſo good as to communicate whatever diſcoveries they may have made on this ſubject in the courſe of their read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, as I ſhould be glad to enrich this work with the choiceſt flowers of antiquity, I intend to publiſh them here. It is a ſubject, if well handled, that muſt give great ſatisfaction to the curious; nay, I could wiſh the world was but well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of ſome late truths concerning Kicking: I fancy it would contribute towards curing the ſpleen of the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The ſtage is the repreſentation of the world; and, certainly, a man may know the humours and inclinations of the people by what is liked or diſliked on the ſtage; and I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a Kicking to be the moſt diverting ſcene in a modern comedy. We have had ſeveral poets of our own nation who have ſucceeded very well this way. There is a Kicking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Sir Harry Wildair and Alderman Smuggler, in the comedy called the Trip to the Jubilee; which is allowed by the ableſt criticks to be a maſter-piece of good writing: there is alſo a Kicking in the old Old Batchelor, and another in the Squire of Alſatia, which are excellently well penned.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto, indeed, theſe Kickings have been only the ſupport and ornament of the comick ſcene: I wiſh, with all my heart, ſome poet of a ſublime genius would venture to write a Kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a tragedy. I am well perſuaded, if an author were to introduce a king Kicking the firſt-miniſter, it would have a very good effect: ſuch an incident muſt certainly give great pleaſure to the audience, and contribute very much to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the play.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0906500201:250"/>But, to come nearer to my preſent purpoſe: I have taken no ſmall pains in examining authors, to find out when this cuſtom of Kicking firſt began in the world. I am ſorry that the writers of hiſtory have not been a little more particular in a matter of ſo great importance to mankind.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Roman Emperors—ſuch as Nero, Domitian, and Caligula—were given to Kicking: ſo, indeed, was our Harry the Eighth; he made nothing of Kicking the Houſe of Commons. There is a box on the ear recorded of Queen Elizabeth: it was a ſudden ſally of jealous love; it was but a kind of <hi>aigre douceur;</hi> and it does not appear that it was the faſhion of her court. The action of Kicking might be thought a little too robuſt for the delicacy of her ſex; it might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the royal legs, <hi>et coetera,</hi> to the ſneers of the young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the court; therefore, ſhe modeſtly turned it into a box on the ear.</p>
                  <p>As no man can account how faſhions riſe and fall, who knows but the practice of Kicking on every trifling occaſion may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a faſhion in this kingdom? One of the greateſt wits of our nation has placed the ſeat of honour in a certain part of the body that I do not well know how to deſcribe. It is the part which we muſt not name in well-bred company; yet happy is the fair maid who ſhall riſe with that part uppermoſt in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; good luck ſhall attend her; her lover ſhall be kind, and all the wiſhes of that day ſhall be crowned with ſucceſs: but, if I muſt deſcribe it ſtill plainer, it is the part where ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys are puniſhed for falſe concords, and for playing truant. If it ſhould, I ſay, become a faſhion, you would ſee a fellow at court, who had juſt received a moſt gracious Kick on that part, return as proud as a citizen from being knighted: and why may not the honour of knighthood be conferred this way, as well as by the ſword? And, indeed, why might not all titles be conferred this way?</p>
                  <p>Again, if you ſhould happen to ſee a crowd of ſlaves runn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the levee of ſome court favourite in a morning, and any body ſhould aſk, how comes this man to be ſo courted, or ſo followed; the natural anſwer in this caſe would be—"He has been lately Kicked into preferment."</p>
                  <p>It might be turned to excellent uſe towards carrying on the deſigns of miniſters of ſtate, in caſe they ſhould happen to be purſuing meaſures apparently deſtructive to the liberties of their country; for, in this caſe, they muſt, for their own ſafety, be obliged to bribe the repreſentatives of the people; and, as they would certainly bribe with the people's money, not with their own, and as I ſhould think it a very right thing to ſave the publick money, I ſhould for that reaſon humbly propoſe, that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0906500201:251"/>Kicking might be introduced into publick buſineſs, inſtead of bribing. I do not doubt that it might anſwer the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; for I am firmly of opinion, that whoever will take a bribe, will take a Kicking.</p>
                  <p>I believe, ſome examples may be brought where it has been made uſe of with ſucceſs: men, I ſay, have been Kicked as well as bribed into meaſures againſt their country; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is not at all improbable but it may, ſome time or other, become a method of carrying on ſtate-affairs. If we ſhould live to ſee that day, young princes, inſtead of riding, fencing, and dancing, would have proper maſters provided to inſtruct them in Kicking; and, as he that undertook to eat a ſword began by eating a dagger, ſo a young adept ſhould begin by Kicking his hat, before he was put to Kick a man.</p>
                  <p>As to the young nobility and gentry, inſtead of waſting their youth in ſtudying to underſtand Horace and Virgil, they might be inſtructed to take a Kicking with a good grace; by which means you would ſee a polite nobility, a valiant gentry, a moſt pious dignified clergy, and a court that would be a conſtellation of the moſt illuſtrious perſonages of the kingdom.</p>
                  <p>There is a court of honour in all the countries of Europe. In France, the mareſchals or generals preſide in it. In Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the judge of the court of honour is hereditary in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the firſt duke of the kingdom. I ſhould think that the ceremonial of Kicking a man into a title, or a great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might be ſettled by the judges of theſe courts of honour. If I might be worthy of adviſing in matters of ſo high a nature, I ſhould think it would be too great a fatigue for the prince himſelf to Kick the whole court, eſpecially in countries where the court is numerous. I am therefore of opinion, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body ſhould have the honour of being Kicked by the ſovereign, except the firſt miniſter, the principal ſecretaries of ſtate, the preſident of his councils, and ſome few others the great officers of the crown; but theſe might Kick thoſe next in employment under them, who might Kick the next; and ſo it might gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually deſcend, till there ſhould not be a man in any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the kingdom but what might be Kicked.</p>
                  <p>It is not yet, indeed, become a cuſtom in any part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; the more is the pity! for I think it would be a truly royal exerciſe for a prince to divert himſelf with Kicking two or three of his miniſters every morning: it would contribute to the preſervation of his own health, as well as to mending the manners of his court; and I believe it would have become a faſhion ſome where or other, were it not that the young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of all nations travel to France, and are apt to retain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of what they ſee there. The barbarity of a French
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0906500201:252"/>education will not ſuffer a gentleman to take a Kick from any perſon, be he ever ſo great, without ſome terrible conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: but I hope that, in this nation, we may live to get the better of thoſe prejudices; which may have this good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, it may introduce an elegance and politeneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners not known in the world, except among the ancient Goths and modern Hottentots.</p>
                  <p>I may ſay, without vanity, that we are not ſuch barbarians, but there may be found among us ſome great men who can pocket up a Kick or a cuff with as good an air as they could a bribe; and as to thoſe ſplendid agitations of choler, which are apt to break out into "Rogue!" and "Raſcal!" I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, ſome very ſtately perſons are ſo uſed to them, that they receive them with the ſame countenance as—"Sir, I kiſs your hands!" This ſhews we are well diſpoſed for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of manners; yet I fear it will not grow into general imitation, unleſs the court ſhould ſet the example, which I am afraid will not happen: but if we ſhould live to ſee that day, the placemen muſt of courſe all fall into it; and I think it would be pleaſant enough, when a great employment became vacant, to ſee a parcel of impudent fellows, in lace and embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery, preſſing and elbowing to be Kicked.</p>
                  <p>If the common people, who are not fond of new faſhions at their firſt riſe, ſhould diſcover any diſlike of coming into it, why might not a Standing Army be employed to Kick the whole nation?</p>

                  <head>ADVERTISEMENT FROM DOROTHY REDFIST; OR, QUALIFICATIONS OF A MODERN MAID-SERVANT.</head>
                  <p>SETTING aſide all houſhold work, which I do very well if I pleaſe, I can tell lyes of my maſter and miſtruſs; and, when I am ſent of an arrand, let it be for what it will in the grocery way, allways go to the chandler's-ſhop; where the good old woman that keeps it, commonly keeps a dram of that that's good, and is as eager to know the ſecrets of the family as I am to tell them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. I can take a lump of freſh-butter—if it is not quite ſo good for a ſarvant's ſtomach as it ſhould be—and flounce it into the greaſe-tubb—or the inſide ſat of a ſurloin of beef—with as much dexterity as any girl in the kingdom, thoſe an I ſay it; where many other ſarvants, to their ſhame be it ſpoken, would give it away to a dog, or a poor parſon; which, I think, is no ſign of their ſavingneſs; becauſe, if they rightly conſider, the revenues of the greaſe-tubb, when properly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0906500201:253"/>would bring them three of four good gownds to their backs in a year.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. I am very quick of hearing when nobody calls; and if any body does, eſpecially my maſter or miſtrus, I am ſo deaf I cannot hear them, till they have almoſt tore their winpipes with calling. This is a ſoverign vartue in a ſarvant; for, when a maſter or miſtrus thinks a ſarvant's deaf, they are apt to talk about their ſecrets with leſs ſuſpicion; and, ſometimes, they may call one another Dog and Bitch, upon the preſumption that the ſarvant cannot hear them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. When there is any reaſon to imagine my miſtrus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> going to have a new gownd, I can tell her ſuch a ſtory, that I a'n't in the leaſt afeard of getting the old one for myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly. If my maſter ſhould come home late, and in liquor, I can help him up to bed: and, in caſe my miſtrus is out of town, ſuppoſing he ſhould be incapable of undreſſing himſelf, I can pull off his cloaths; and, if required, can go to bed to him as well as my miſtrus.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly. If my miſtrus ſhould be a breeding woman, and apt to lye-inn during the time, I can ſide with the nurſe, and make as much waſte as herſelf; play up old gooſeberry with the pots and ſaucepans; and nock the pewter and braſſes about with as much conſideration, as if they coſt nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly. During her lying-inn, I can trump up a ſtory about my maſter's going to lewd women. This, you know, may have it's effect; for, if a miſtrus takes on in ſuch a ſituation, and frets much about it, who knows but ſhe may die? and then I ſtand a chance to marry my maſter.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly. If there is a cruſt of bread harder than ordinary, I always carry it to my maſter's table; for maſters and miſtruſſes may eat it, becauſe they know their ſarvants won't.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly. If there is any kind of greens for dinner—as there commonly is—I always take care to ſend the outſide leaves to maſter's table, and detach the beſt part in a cullender, over ſome hot water, till they have done: for why ſhould not ſarvants know what's good as well as their maſters and miſtruſſes?</p>
                  <p>P. S. Theſe, and many other, excellent vartues, too tedious to mention, I porſſes; and ſhould take it very kind of you, Mr. Editor, if you ſhould hear of any body that wants ſuch a ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Indeed, it is not any place I would go to, for good places are very ſcarce; and where there is one maſter or miſtrus that knows the vartues of a true ſarvant, there are twenty that don't: therefore, I ſhould be obliged to you, if you publiſh the above cat-a-log in your Maghazeen.</p>

                  <p>I Am a phyſician; and as my caſe is very extraordinary, I mean to publiſh it for the benefit of the publick. When a man lives, as I did, unmarried till he is ſixty-one, he had better never marry at all. There are more ways by which a woman may torment her huſband beſides being jealous of him. To give you ſome idea of my ſituation, take the general outlines of my hiſtory. The earlieſt part of my life I ſpent at college in the ſtudy of phyſick; and, I don't know why, acquired the character of an odd learned fellow. When I arrived at the age of forty, a vacancy happened in the neighbourhood of my birth, and I was invited by my uncle to take upon me the infirmities of all the folks within the circle of twenty miles. Before I ſet out, I ordered the college-barber to make me what the wags called a Lion, or a Pomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fees came in apace; ſo that, in the courſe of twenty years, I had ſaved up more money than I really knew what to do with. Whether it was my learning, my perſon, or my money, I can't ſay; but a lady of the neighbourhood took a vaſt liking to ſomething belonging to me. I was not ſo blind but I ſaw the conqueſt; for ſhe would often come and ſpend a week to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with me: in ſhort, I married her—I was paſt the years of diſcretion, and ſo I married her. O what a condeſcenſion! A lady of her rank, family, and faſhion in life! As for age, indeed, ſhe was but ſix years younger than myſelf; and for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, if ſhe ever had any, ſhe had ſpent it; and yet I was ſuch a fool, as to be convinced ſhe was conferring the greateſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the world upon me.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>My ſnuff-coloured ſuit had been reinſtated every other year from a pattern that was left in the hands of an honeſt taylor on the neighbouring heath. He, poor fellow, was likewiſe forbid the houſe; becauſe, according to my directions, he made my cloaths eaſy. A more faſhionable operator was charged with preparing a new ſuit with gold button-holes: he made them to ſit ſo exactly, that I dare not bring my hands to meet before me, for fear of laying open my ſpinal bone.</p>

                  <p>She is, as I told you, but ſix years younger than myſelf; yet ſhe dreſſes, dances, and drives about, as if ſhe was but five-and-twenty.</p>
                  <p>This, however, and much more, I could bear; I deſerve it: I am contented ſhe ſhall conſume ſix-and-thirty yards more than my old maid Heſter in the ſpinning of her gown; ſhe may play a ſhilling a fiſh at quadrille; ſhe may do—aye, ſhe may do what ſhe pleaſes, let me have but my ſtudy to myſelf; let my night-cap and ſlippers he reſtored, and I will ſubmit to wear the new coat and the wig every Sunday.</p>
                  <p>P. S. I long to take poor Jonas again: he uſed always to ride before me; and, drunk or ſober, he knew the ſhorteſt way all over the country.

However, let theſe uſeful Portals never be ſhut againſt the adviſing Friend, the inſtructing Parent, or the ſupplicating Orphan. There is a ſingle Gate in the front, by which all your company is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, and this ſhould in general be barred cloſe: it, is, indeed, ſo very publick, that you can hardly let out any Viſitor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately; and you muſt be very careful that no ſuſpicious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter be ſeen to quit it, leſt you draw a ſcandal on your Houſe. Whatever Company, therefore, may have forced their way into the Side-Portals, it will be neceſſary to lay the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt injunctions of vigilance on the Two able Porters, who ſtand conſtantly before the ivory Palliſadoes, in a livery of the deepeſt ſcarlet. I have ſeen ſome Ladies paint the Two Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, juſt below the Windows of their Houſes; but I adviſe you to avoid that cuſtom, as the natural colours far exceed every decoration of art.</p>
                  <p>This part of the Edifice is ſupported by a Pillar of Corinthian Marble, the baſe of which is ornamented with a pair of Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter Semi-Globes; and over theſe it will be very proper to draw a fine lawn curtain.</p>
                  <p>Beneath theſe is the Great Hall, in which you have a ſmall Cloſet of exquiſite workmanſhip: this, I ſuppoſe, is the place of your ſecret retirement, open to none but yourſelf, and ſome approved friends: I adviſe you to keep this always clean; to furniſh it well; to make it a little library of the beſt practical authors; and to viſit it frequently, eſpecially when you return from church, or leave a circle of acquaintance whom you have met at the tea-table.</p>
                  <p>Let the outſide of your Hall not appear like a horſe hung round with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>You are ſenſible, Miſs, that Time effaces the beauty, and demoliſhes the ſtrength, of the nobleſt ſtructures; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, do not be alarmed on finding yours ſubject to the like change. Doubtleſs, it has often wanted repairs, though you have lived in it no longer; which is a plain intimation that the Houſe muſt in a few years fall. You may, indeed, ſoon be turned out; the Landlord may give you warning, or he may not; and, as all this is quite uncertain, be perpetually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and then you need never be afraid of quitting it.</p>
                  <p>One thing I muſt not forget to obſerve: when you have once left your Houſe, no other human being will ever inhabit
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0906500201:258"/>it, but it will be waſte and in ruins; yet the Proprietor has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſome time or other to rebuild it, for your reception, in a more durable manner. But though it will then be conſtructed with the ſame materials, they are to be ſo refined and modified by the Great Architect, that the edifice will not be in future liable to any accident or decay; and, as it is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that your Habitation be reared in ſome other place, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh it may be ſituated in a finer country, under a milder climate, and on a ſpot not expoſed to thoſe pitileſs ſtorms, which injure, and too often deſtroy, the beſt contrived Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this ſublunary abode—ſince you muſt then take it for a term which will never expire!</p>

                     <l>WHEN good King Jemmy wore the Britiſh crown,</l>
                     <l>A pleaſant jeſt for higheſt wit went down:</l>
                     <l>A pun, a quibble, a conundrum quaint,</l>
                     <l>Oft made a biſhop of a man no ſaint,</l>
                     <l>Smart repartees paſs'd all for ſterling coin,</l>
                     <l>And wit was then as unrefin'd as wine:</l>
                     <l>The king himſelf, ſo reſt his merry ſoul!</l>
                     <l>Could crack his joke—nor would his mirth controul;</l>
                     <l>But laugh full hearty if the jeſt were keen,</l>
                     <l>Nor could the care of kingdoms give him ſpleen.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Thus ſtory tells—As he rode out one day,</l>
                     <l>To chace the ſtag, he loſt, by chance, his way:</l>
                     <l>The courtiers eager, ſcour the ſpacious field,</l>
                     <l>While duty there did unto pleaſure yield.</l>
                     <l>Alone, King Jemmy, with his uſual grace,</l>
                     <l>Kept ſtepping onward in a common pace.</l>
                     <l>Till near two clowns he came, who work'd full hard,</l>
                     <l>Hedging a cloſe behind a farmer's yard.</l>
                     <l>They ſpied the king; and, from his aukward mien,</l>
                     <l>Thought he ſome needy northern laird had been.</l>
                     <l>"Gend men," quoth he—and then he made his bow,</l>
                     <l>"Ken ye which way the nobles rode juſt now?</l>
                     <l>My buſineſs leads me unto our King James."</l>

                     <l>Out-ſtretch'd his royal limbs upon the place,</l>
                     <l>And ſtept full ſweetly on the verdant graſs.</l>
                     <l>No policies of ſtate diſturb'd his mind,</l>
                     <l>But that good prince ſnor'd loud as any hind,</l>

                     <l>When duty found a place in courtier's head:</l>

                     <l>"My lords," quoth he, "as you rid yonder by,</l>

                     <l>"Weel," quoth the king, and gave their necks a ſtrap,</l>

                  <l>They chanc'd to get the maids with child,</l>
                  <l>Would ſternly take the cauſe in hand,</l>

                  <l>With utmoſt rigour would enforce</l>
                  <l>The rigid laws that came in courſe;</l>

                  <l>As murder ſome odd time will out;</l>
                  <l>And ſo it chanc'd, one luckleſs night,</l>

                  <l>His poſt ſo boldly he maintain'd,</l>
                  <l>The fatal growing proof remain'd;</l>
                  <l>For ſcarce ſix months were gone and paſt,</l>
                  <l>Ere Betty ſwell'd about the waiſt:</l>

                  <l>The fearful wench inform'd her maſter;</l>
                  <l>Who—as it is the ſinner's way,</l>
                  <l>To put far off the evil day—</l>
                  <l>Neglects her till ſo large it made her,</l>

                  <l>He'll for the child and her provide.</l>
                  <l>Betty, whoſe conſcience wond'rous nice is,</l>

                  <l>Pretends to diſbelieve their railing;</l>
