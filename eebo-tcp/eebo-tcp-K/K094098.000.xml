            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>PROPRIETY and affection alike incline me to inſcribe to you the
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undertaking. We are mutual and peculiar ſufferers by the event of
the campaign in 1777. You were witneſſes and judges of my actions; but I
owed you an account of the principles which directed them.</p>
            <p>Another motive for this Addreſs is to avail myſelf of a proper
public op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to repeat to you, what I have omitted no occaſion of
expreſſing in Parliament, in correſpondence, and in
converſation—the fulleſt approbation of your ſervices. My errors
may have been numberleſs; your conduct has been uniform—faithful,
gallant and indefatigable. Debarred of the power of doing you juſtice before
the King, theſe teſtimonies are the only means to which my eſteem and
gratitude can reſort.</p>
            <p>After vindicating myſelf as a commanding officer from any
inattention to your intereſt or fame, I next throw myſelf upon your
judgment for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as a friend.</p>
            <p>You will find by this publication, and ſome others, which though
not addreſſed to you will probably engage your curioſity, that I have
been accuſed of ſhrinking from the common captivity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0652302600:4"/> I have been ſupported under that
aſperſion by the conſciouſneſs I did not deſerve it, and the
confidence that you (to whom chiefly upon that charge I was reſponſible)
would not adopt it. After the fortunes we have run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is not
ſurely unworthy of belief, that I ſhould rather have deſired, than
avoided to partake the cloſing ſcene: uniting with a due ſenſe of
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal attachments, the preſervation of my military fortune, and a
retreat from the diſtractions of my country. The defence of your honour and
my own, at one time, and reſiſtance to an affront<note n="*" place="bottom">The part of my treatment which I call an affront upon this and
other occaſions, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of my ſervice in this country, even at
the head of my own regiment, or as a volunteer, in the time of exigency, and
when other officers <hi>preciſely in my own ſituation</hi> were employed.
My complaint of this partiality has never been officially anſwered; it has
only been evaded by anonymous writers, who have laid it down as a poſition,
that I meant to allude to the example of Lord Harrington (with which it
certainly has nothing to do) and then have taken a merit in refuting me. The
particular example to which I appeal is that of Lieutenant Colonel King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,
of the 86th regiment, appointed to that regiment, employed in it for the
defence of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, and actually now embarking with it for foreign ſervice,
under the ſame terms of the convention, and the ſame terms of parole to the
Congreſs verbatim with myſelf. Other objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of a nature that
could not be afterwards ſupported, were tried againſt the Duke of Rutland's
recommendation of this excellent officer: but the objection of parole, though
fully known to be preciſely the ſame with that which was ſo peremptorily
urged againſt my preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, was never mentioned.</note> which my nature
could not bear, at another, alone detained me here.</p>
            <p>In regard to my political tranſactions, I have ſtated them,
and I wiſh them to be conſidered by my friends, apart from my miltary
conduct. I bear very high reſpect to ſome eminent and ill-treated
characters in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, who in deference to the tranquility of
government, have ſilently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the ſtations which they could no
longer hold with ſecurity to their honour, or benefit to the ſtate. But the
option is not left to thoſe, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a voice in Parliament are obliged to
act as citizens as well as ſoldiers. The number of officers altogether of the
army and navy, who with known love to their country and profeſſional
ſpirit equally conſpicuous, have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily withdrawn themſelves from
employment within theſe two years, exceeds all precedent. I do not place my
name in the liſt with the ſame pretenſions; but it is not arrogant to
emulate where we cannot compare; and I am deſirous of following the high
examples before me in no point more than in that of avoiding to diſturb the
zeal of thoſe who are now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. The officers who have held it their duty
to take part in oppoſition, have acted openly and directly in their place in
Parliament; but they may <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0652302600:5"/> defy malice to ſhew an inſtance
wherein they have not encouraged ardour in their profeſſion. They
contemplate with one and the ſame ſentiment the great ſupply of
honourable men to occupy their places.</p>
            <p>You, Gentlemen, ſtand high in that deſcription; your trials
have made you of ſterling value; and perhaps it will be better diſcerned by
men in power, when no longer viewed through the unfavourable medium of my
friendſhip. If my exhortations retain their former weight, let me be
permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted earneſtly to apply them upon this occaſion. The examples of
generals or admirals who decline employment, reſpect only ſimilar caſes;
your honour is ſecure: look not at profeſſional diſappointments; but
point all your views to the true glory of your King and country, and truſt
for the reward.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN it becomes neceſſary for men who have acted critical
parts in public ſtations to make an appeal to the world in their own
juſtification, there are many prudential conſiderations which might lead
them to commit the care of it to friends, or, which is in many reſpects the
ſame thing, to defend themſelves under an aſſumed character. The charge
of vanity uſually made on egotiſm is thus eluded: a fuller ſcope may be
given to ſelf-love and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reſentment: even the lower vexations
which attend an author are to a great degree avoided: the ill-nature of
criticiſm is ſeldom awakened by anonymous writings, and the venal pens of
party loſe half their gall when the object of it is not perſonally and
directly in queſtion.</p>
            <p>But there are ſituations, in which, not only general aſſent
ſeems to juſtify a man in ſpeaking of himſelf, but in which alſo no
little conſideration ought to be admitted to the mind. Such will be the
caſe, if I am not deceived, when the intereſts of the public are blended
with thoſe of the individual; and when his very errors may ſerve as
inſtruction to others. Misfortunes which awaken ſenſibility will be a
further, and a perſuaſive call, upon the <hi>attention</hi> of the public;
and it will amount to a claim upon their <hi>juſtice,</hi> if he can ſhew
that he has been injuriouſly treated.</p>
            <p>Upon maturely weighing theſe and ſeveral other
circumſtances, after I had been denied a profeſſional examination of my
conduct, and diſappointed of a parliamentary one, I determined to lay before
the public a ſtate of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from Canada, in 1777, in my own name.
And my firſt deſign was to do it under the title, and with the latitude of
Memoirs; as a mode by which I could beſt open the principles of my actions,
and introduce, with moſt propriety, collateral characters, incidents, and
diſcuſſions, as they might occaſionally tend to illuſtrate the main
ſubject.</p>
            <p>However, in the laſt ſeſſion of Parliament, the enquiry
which had not been agreed to the year before, took place. I had preſſed it,
and I entered into it under all the diſadvantages which attend a ſtruggle
with power, and <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0652302600:7"/> the prejudice that power can raiſe
againſt the perſons it means to deſtroy. The utmoſt that power could do
was done; the Paliament was prorogued pending the proceedings. But though by
this contrivance, a final and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal adjudication by that auguſt
aſſembly was avoided, their minutes ſtand a ſacred record of truth and
juſtice, and the moſt ſatisfactory reliance to which my wiſhes could
aſpire, in offering my actions to the judgment of my country at large.</p>
            <p>From that time, therefore, I reſolved to publiſh, inſtead of
Memoirs, the Proceedings preciſely as they paſſed in Parliament, and to
continue my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by ſuch Obſervations and Comments upon the Evidence,
as I ſhould have had a right, and was prepared to make, had the proceedings
in the houſe continued.<note n="*" place="bottom">The order in which the
committee in the Houſe of Commons proceeded was, to hear Sir William Howe's
Narrative, reſpecting his conduct whilſt in command in America, and ſuch
evidence as he thought proper to bring in ſupport of it. They next heard my
Narrative and Evidence, reſpecting the conduct of the expedition from Canada.
Lord George Germain then opened a defence on his part, and ſummoned
witneſſes to ſupport it. According to the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by the
committee, Sir William Howe and myſelf were afterwards to be heard in reply;
but the proceedings were ended by the prorogation of Parliament before the
examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lord George's ſecond witneſs, Mr. Galloway, was cloſed,
and there were ſixteen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen more upon his liſt. The order in which
the following papers are placed is—1ſt. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatory Speech. 2d. The
Narrative. 3d. Minutes of the verbal evidence. 4th. Review of the evidence,
with Remarks and Explanations, &amp;c. 5th. An Appendix, containing the written
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Poſſibly in this latter part ſome colour of my original
deſign may remain. The ſcenes I have been engaged in are uncommon, and it
is a natural deſire to place them in a full light. The intereſts concerned
make that deſire more urgent; and I dare believe they will be beſt guarded
by being moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>

               <salute>MR. MONTAGU,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEFORE I enter upon the narrative, which the precedent of your
late proceedings authoriſes me to lay before you, I think it a duty to the
committee, to promiſe that I ſhall trouble them with little other matter
than ſuch as may be neceſſary to elucidate the tranſactions of the
campaign 1777, in that quarter where I commanded.</p>
            <p>I ſhall keep in mind, that to explain the cauſes of the
diſaſter at Saratoga is the principal point to which all my evidence ought
to lead: but at the ſame time, I ſhall take confidence in the juſtice and
benevolence of my hearers, that where arguments in exculpation of the commander
can aptly be combined with a faithful repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of facts, they will not
be deemed foreign to the main object under their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe ideas, though ſome introductory explanations are
requiſite, I ſhall ſuppreſs the inclination I at firſt conceived, of
ſtating my conduct from the time, when, conjointly with my honourable friend
who took the lead in this enquiry,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir William
Howe.</note> I was called to the unſolicited and unwelcome ſervice in
America: nor will I enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the complicated circumſtances of private
misfortune and ill health under which I purſued it. Prudence, as well as
other propriety, is, I confeſs, conſulted in this ſuppreſſion; for
were it ſeen, that an officer had blended with the reſpect due to
authority, warm, though diſintereſted perſonal attachments; that under a
perſuaſion of the honour and integrity of the king's ſervants, he had
united to his zeal for the public cauſe an intereſt in their private credit
and ambition; would it not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that his guilt muſt have been
atrocious, beyond all excuſe or palliation, to induce the very men to whom
his endeavours, and his faculties, ſuch as they were, had been thus devoted,
not only completely to deſert him, but to preclude him, as far as in them
lay, from every means of defence, and if poſſible, to ruin him in the
opinion of the king, the army, and the country?</p>
            <p>An earneſt deſire to ſave, as much as poſſible, the time
of the committee, would alſo diſſuade me from recurring to any points
previous to my inſtructions which have been diſcuſſed upon former
occaſions; but I find that great ſtreſs is ſtill laid to my prejudice
upon a paper which found its way to the houſe during my abſence: I mean the
private letter to the noble lord, ſecretary for the American department,
dated 1ſt January, 1777.<note n="*" place="margin">See Appendix No.
I.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The noble Lord has frequently ſtated that letter to have
ſlipped inadvertently into the parcel deſtined for the houſe, and I give
credit in that particular to his aſſertion; <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0652302600:9"/> becauſe,
whatever other impreſſions he might have found it his intereſt to make
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting me, he certainly would not have thought that the imputation on me
which that letter tended to fix, a proper one for <hi>him</hi> to put forward:
it is a notorious fact, or I would not mention it, that it has been held a
reflection upon my character (by the part of the public with whom the noble
lord is unpopular) that I addreſſed him as a patron and friend.</p>
            <p>This is an imputation to which I muſt plead guilty; for at the
time I wrote that letter, I certainly did hold that noble lord as my friend,
and I had acted to deſerve he ſhould be ſo. The next ill tendency of that
paper was, as the noble lord well knows, to impreſs the public with an
opinion, that I was endeavouring to ſupplant Sir Guy Carleton in the command
of the northern army—an action abhorrent to the honour of an officer and
the liberality of a gentleman; and of which, thank God, I can prove the
falſehood, by irrefragable evidence upon your table, and in a very ſmall
compaſs. I need only refer to the diſpatches to Sir Guy Carleton by his aid
de-camp, dated 22d Auguſt, 1776,<note n="*" place="margin">See Appendix No.
II.</note> four months before I came home, to ſhew that it was at that time
determined, that Sir Guy Carleton ſhould remain in Canada; and that
determination was made, as I have been informed, not only upon the political
reaſoning which appears in that diſpatch, but alſo, upon great law
opinions, that he could not, under the commiſſion he then held under the
great ſeal, paſs the frontiers of his province. Sir, this confutation was
urged by me laſt year; and were collateral proof neceſſary to my
juſtification upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I could bring to your bar a tribe of
gentlemen, who had imbibed impreſſions not very favourable to the military
proceedings of Sir Guy Carleton in the campaign of 1776: I could ſhew that I
ſeized numberleſs, indeed I ſeized every poſſible oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to
vindicate the judgment, the aſſiduity, the activity of that highly
reſpectable officer, careleſs how ill I paid my court, earneſt to meet
every attack againſt his fame.</p>
            <p>I beg leave alſo to call the attention of the committee very
particularly to one other paper, the date of which is previous to my departure
from England: it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, "Thoughts for conducting the War from the Side
of Canada, by Lieutenant General Burgoyne."<note n="*" place="margin">No.
III.</note> Sir, it will be in the recollection of the committee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when the conduct of the war was under conſideration laſt year in my
abſence, it was not underſtood, that the plan of the northern expedition
was formed upon that paper as produced upon your table? If ſo, I muſt aſk
the noble lord, why he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that error to prevail? The noble lord knew,
(and it was peculiarly his duty to declare it) that the two propoſals, the
firſt of turning the expedition eventually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Connecticut; and the
ſecond, of embarking the army in the river St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in order to effect
a junction with Sir William Howe by ſea, in caſe the attempt by land
appeared 
<q rend="inline">"impracticable, or too hazardous,"</q> were
eraſed while the paper was in his lordſhip's hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0652302600:10"/> From that paper, as it appeared without
eraſures, naturally aroſe the concluſion, that the plan I had to execute
was completely my own; upon that paper were founded, as naturally, the doubts
which have been entertained upon the peremptory tenor of my inſtructions. I
muſt again aſk the noble lord, upon what principle of juſtice he
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered thoſe impreſſions to exiſt in this houſe? Why, in a
debate in which he took a part, did he conceal, that the circumſtances in
reality were totally different from thoſe upon which gentlemen reaſoned;
that the diſcretion reſerved in the paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the houſe was taken
away, and conſequently, that my orders were rendered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in the
ſtricteſt ſenſe by his own alterations?</p>
            <p>Let any gentleman who has ſuppoſed I had an implied latitude
for my conduct, now compare this circumſtance with the wording of the letter
to Sir Guy Carleton, dated March 26, 1777, with a copy of which I was
furniſhed, and extracts from which were afterwards the only orders I had to
act upon.<note n="*" place="margin">See Appendix No. IV.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall take no particular notice of what is called the ſaving
clauſe, in the latter part of the orders, except to give the flatteſt
contradiction to the ſuppoſition that I dictated it—a ſuppoſition
that I know is not yet abandoned by the men who firſt ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted it. I
have ſpoke to it very fully upon a former occaſion;<note n="†" place="bottom">The debate upon Mr. Vyner's motion, May 28, 1778; the
ſpeech was publiſhed.</note> and I do not wiſh, when it can be avoided,
to enforce or reiterate the charges of duplicity and treachery which muſt
enſue, if that clauſe could be ſuppoſed to have reference to any
conduct previous to my arrival at Albany. The circumſtance of forbidding me
the latitude in the two particulars I had propoſed in my plan, and many other
circumſtances, clearly indicating the decided intentions and expectations of
the miniſters, rendered the ſenſe of the whole order taken together clear
and diſtinct, and ſhewed that the clauſe which is pretended to have left
me a diſcretion as to my main object, had no ſort of relation to that
object. That clauſe evidently related not to my forcing my way, or not
forcing it, to Albany, the place of my deſtination, but to ſuch collateral
and eventual operations as might be adviſeable in the courſe of my march.
It related to the making impreſſion upon the rebels, and bringing them to
obedience, in ſuch manner as exigencies might require, and in my judgment
might ſeem moſt proper, previous to receiving orders from Sir William Howe,

<q rend="inline">"of my junction with whom I was never to loſe
view."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding there has been ſo much diſcuſſion in
debate and print upon the interpretation of abſolute orders, the committee, I
am confident, will abſolve me, though, at the expence of a few moments more,
I ſhould continue a ſubject upon which the merit or blame of the future
proceedings in great meaſure reſts.</p>
            <p>I do not admit the poſition, that there can be no caſe in
which an officer acting at a diſtance is bound at every hazard to purſue
orders, that appear abſolute <hi>and deciſive.</hi> 
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0652302600:11"/> It
is eaſy to conceive circumſtances, which might juſtify a ſtate in
hazarding an army, for the ſake of facilitating great and deciſive objects.
Gentlemen, converſant in military hiſtory, will recollect many examples of
this principle: upon a former occaſion, I ſtated a ſuppoſed
caſe;<note n="*" place="bottom">The caſe alluded to was put in a former
debate, as follows: ſuppoſe the Britiſh army that invaded Britany in
1758, had gained a complete victory over the Duke D'Aiguillon; to have marched
rapidly towards Paris, abandoning the communication with the fleet, expoſing
the army poſſibly to great want of proviſion, and to the impracticability
of retreat, would certainly have been a meaſure conſummately deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and unjuſtifiable, if tried upon military ſyſtem; yet, will any man
ſay, that if that meaſure muſt evidently have produced ſuch alarm and
confuſion in the heart of France, as to have compelled the recall of her
whole force from Germany, or ſuch part of it, as would have given
uncontrouled ſcope to the armies under the King of Pruſſia and Prince
Ferdinand, that the miniſter of England would not have been judicious, though
at the palpable riſk of the army, as far as capture was concerned, in
ordering the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to proceed by the moſt <hi>vigorous exertions,</hi> and
to force his way to Paris?</note> and I now entreat leave to add a real example
of peremptory orders, which happened in the courſe of my own ſervice. I
have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the impreſſion, that the circumſtance I am going to
relate, made upon my mind at the time; and to thoſe few who may ſtill
think, that in any part of my conduct, I raſhly riſked my peace, my
intereſt or my fame, to forward the wiſhes of others, this
prepoſſeſſion may in ſome meaſure account for, and excuſe my
imprudence.</p>
            <p>In the campaign of 1762, in Portugal, the Count La Lippe, a name,
which, if it finds a due hiſtorian, will ſtand among the firſt in
military fame, was placed at the head of about 6000 Britiſh troops, and a
Portugueſe army, the greater part of which was little better than nominal, to
defend an extenſive frontier againſt the whole force of Spain, and a large
body of the veteran troops of France. The ſalvation of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal depended
ſolely on the capacity of that great man, which united the deepeſt
political reaſoning with exquiſite military addreſs.</p>
            <p>I had the honour to be entruſted with the defence of the moſt
important paſs upon the Tagus, and my orders were peremptory to maintain it
againſt any numbers, and to the laſt man.</p>
            <p>A ſelect corps of the enemy, greatly ſuperior to mine, were
encamped within ſight on the other ſide the river, and our advanced poſts
were within half muſquet ſhot.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation, I received intelligence from Count La Lippe,
of a deſign of the enemy to paſs the Tagus in force, about ſix miles
above me, and to take poſſeſſion of the open country in my rear, with a
large corps of cavalry, by which means all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, ſupply, or ſafe
retreat, would be cut off.</p>
            <p>Together with this intelligence, the Count's letter expreſſed,

<q rend="inline">"That every delay to the enemy in getting
poſſeſſion of the paſs I guarded, was ſo material to his other
plans and operations, that it juſtified a deviation from ſyſtematic
rules; that, therefore, after taking timely precautions to ſecure the retreat
of my cavalry, I muſt abide the conſequence with the infantry; that at the
laſt extremity, I muſt abandon my cannon, camp, &amp;c. and with ſuch
proviſion as the men could carry <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0652302600:12"/> upon their backs, throw
myſelf into the mountains upon my left, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by ſmall and
diſperſed parties, to gain a rendezvous at the northern part of the
province."</q> I muſt obſerve, that when theſe peremptory orders were
given, the commander was at a diſtance that made all timely communication of
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as impoſſible, as if the Atlantic had been between us; and
I cannot cloſe the example without mentioning the concluding part of Count La
Lippe's letter. 
<q rend="inline">"He participated," he ſaid, "in the feelings
with which an officer would be ſtruck for his reputation, in ſuffering
himſelf to be cut, and reduced to ſacrifice his camp, his baggage, and
twenty pieces of cannon. But <hi>be at eaſe,</hi>" continued that great and
generous man, "<hi>I will take the meaſure entirely upon myſelf,
perſevere as I have directed, and be confident of my defence and
protection.</hi>"</q> This was a ſaving clauſe of a nature very different
from thoſe it is the practice in the preſent day to pen; and if any man
doubts the quotation, I can bring poſitive evidence to the truth of it
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim.</p>
            <p>Thus much, Sir, I thought it incumbent upon me to ſtate in
argument againſt the poſition that has been inſiſted upon, that no
orders can be worded ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily at a diſtance, as not to admit of an
implied latitude, in caſe of unforeſeen and inſurmountable difficulties:
but to prevent all future cavil, upon this ſubject, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the
committee to recollect, what I have again and again repeated; that I by no
means put my defence, in paſſing the Hudſon's River, ſolely upon this
reaſoning. On the contrary, ſuppoſing for the argument's ſake, I
ſhould concede (which I never have done, nor mean to do) to the noble Lord,
and to every other gentleman, all they can deſire to aſſume upon implied
latitude in given caſes, I ſhould equally prove that no ſuch caſe did
exiſt, as would have juſtified me upon their own principle, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from the letter of the orders under which I acted.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared my way to the time of my leaving England, to
take upon me the command of the Northern expedition; I ſhall now lay before
the committee a narrative of its progreſs, in as conciſe and ſimple
terms, as the nature of the ſubject will allow, endeavouring to imitate the
perſpicuity of the honourable gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who took the lead in this
buſineſs, and not without hope of my endeavours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the ſame
effect; and that, in the opinion of the houſe, my language, as has been
expreſſed of his, will be deemed the language of truth.</p>

more ready comprehenſion of the whole ſubject, to divide it into three
periods. The firſt, from my appointment to the command, to the end of my
purſuit of the enemy from Ticonderoga; the ſecond, from that time to the
paſſage of the Hudſon's River; and the third to the ſigning the
convention.</p>
            <p>I left London on the 27th of March, and upon my departure from
Plymouth, finding the Albion man of war ready to ſail for New-York, I wrote
to Sir W. Howe by that conveyance, upon the ſubject of my expedition, and the
nature of my orders. I arrived at Quebec the 6th of May. Sir Guy Carleton
immediately put under my command the troops deſtined for the expedition, and
committed to my management the preparatory arrangements. From thence I wrote a
ſecond letter to Sir William Howe, wherein I repeated that I was entruſted
with the command of the army deſtined to march from Canada, and that my
orders were to force a junction with his excellency.</p>
            <p>I expreſſed alſo my wiſhes, 
<q rend="inline">"that a latitude had been left me for a
diverſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Connecticut, but that ſuch an idea being out of
queſtion, by my orders being preciſe to force the junction, it was only
mentioned to introduce the idea ſtill reſting upon my mind; viz. to give
the change to the enemy if I could, and by every feint in my power to
eſtabliſh a ſuſpicion, that I ſtill pointed towards
Connecticut."</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"But," I repeated, "that under the preſent
preciſion of my orders, I ſhould really have no view but that of joining
him, nor think myſelf juſtified by any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to delay the moſt
expeditious means I could find to effect that purpoſe."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I proceeded to Montreal on the 12th, and as my letters, lately
laid before the houſe from that place,<note n="*" place="margin">See Appendix
No. V.</note> and from Quebec, will ſhew the ſtate of things, I ſhould
not reſt a moment upon this period, were it not to add one more public
teſtimony, to thoſe I am not conſcious of having omitted upon any
occaſion, of the aſſiduous and cordial manner in which the different
ſervices were forwarded by Sir Guy Carleton. I ſhould think it as
diſhonourable to ſeek, as I know it would be impoſſible to find
excuſe for any fault of mine in any failure on the part of Sir Guy Carleton,
or of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who acted under him, in any matter reſpecting the
expedition. Had that officer been acting for himſelf, or for his brother, he
could not have ſhewn more indefatigable zeal than he did, to comply with and
expedite my requiſitions and deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0652302600:14"/> Certain parts of the expected force,
nevertheleſs, fell ſhort. The Canadian troops, ſtated in the plan at
2000, conſiſted only of three companies, intended to be of 100 men each,
but in reality not amounting to more than 150 upon the whole; nor could they be
augmented. The corvées, which are detachments of provincials without
arms, to repair roads, convey proviſions, or any other temporary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the king's ſervice, could not be obtained in ſufficient number, nor
kept to their employments, although Sir Guy Carleton uſed every poſſible
exertion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for the purpoſe. Drivers for the proviſion
carts, and other carriages, could not be fully ſupplied by the contractor,
though no expence was ſpared; a circumſtance which occaſioned much
inconvenience afterwards.</p>
            <p>To theſe unavoidable diſappointments were added the
difficulties occaſioned by bad weather, which rendered the roads almoſt
impracticable at the carrying places, and conſequently the paſſage of the
batteaux, artillery, and baggage exceedingly dilatory: we had beſides a great
deal of contrary wind. Notwithſtanding all impediments the army aſſembled
between the 17th and 20th of June, at Cumberland Point, upon Lake
Champlain.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt I held a conference with the Iroquois, Algonchins,
Abenekies, and Outawas, Indians, in all about four hundred.</p>
            <p>This conference appears in your papers<note n="*" place="margin">See
Appendix No. VI.</note>. I thought at the time that the cordiality of the
Indians over the whole continent might be depended upon, and their firſt
operations tended to perſuade me into a belief of their utility. The prieſt
to whom they ſeemed devoted, and the Britiſh officers employed to conduct
them, and to whoſe controul they engaged to ſubmit, gained advantages, and
ſpread terror without bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity. The firſt party ſent out made ſeveral
of the enemy priſoners in the heat of action, and treated them with European
humanity.</p>
            <p>During the movement of the different corps to this general
rendezvous, I wrote a third letter to Sir William Howe. The chief purport of it
was to give him 
<q rend="inline">"intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of my ſituation at the time, and
of my expectation of being before Ticonderoga between the 20th and 25th
inſtant; that I did not apprehend the effective ſtrength of the army would
amount to above 6500 men; that I meant to apply to Sir Guy Carleton to ſend a
garriſon to Ticonderoga when it ſhould be reduced, but that I was
apprehenſive he would not think himſelf authoriſed by the King's orders
to comply; that whenever, therefore, I might be able to effect the junction,
Sir William would not expect me to bring near the original number. I repeated
my perſeverance in the idea of giving jealouſy on the ſide of
Connecticut, and at the ſame time my aſſurances, that I ſhould make no
manoeuvre that could procraſtinate the great object of a junction."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſtate theſe different letters to Sir William Howe merely to
ſhew that my concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preciſion of my orders was not upon
after-thought, and taken up as an <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0652302600:15"/> excuſe when I found the
expedition had failed; but a fixed decided ſentiment coeval with my knowledge
of my command.</p>
            <p>For a further proof of the ſame fact, I beg leave to ſtate an
extract from my orders to the army at Crown Point, June 30th. The words were
theſe.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"The army embarks to-morrow to approach the enemy.
The ſervices required of this particular expedition are critical and
conſpicuous. During our progreſs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions may occur, in which, nor
difficulty, nor labour, nor life are to be regarded. This army muſt not
retreat."</q> Were it neceſſary, I could bring abundant collateral proof to
the ſame effect, and ſhew that the idea of forcing a way to Albany by
vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exertions againſt any oppoſition we might meet, was general and
fixt through the whole army.</p>
            <p>My proceedings from the time of aſſembling the army as before
deſcribed, to the date of my public diſpatch from Skeneſborough,
comprehending the manoeuvres which forced the enemy from Ticondenoga, and the
actions at Skeneſborough, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton, and Fort Anne, are related at full in
that diſpatch.<note n="*" place="margin">See Appendix No. VII.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is the leſs neceſſary to give the Committee further
trouble upon this ſubject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I believe no enemy can be found to
arraign my conduct in thoſe days of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; or if there were one, he
could not deprive me of the conſolation, that I had his Majeſty's full
approbation and applauſe, of which it is known to many, I had a very
honourable and diſtinguiſhed proof.</p>
            <p>All therefore that is neceſſary before I quit this firſt
period of the campaign, is to give a preciſe ſtate of the effective
ſtrength of the army, at the time it aſſembled.</p>

            <p>In regard to the artillery, I think this the proper place to
rectify the miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have prevailed reſpecting the
quantity employed. It has been ſtated as far beyond the neceſſary
proportion for the number of troops, an incumbrance to their movements, and one
cauſe of what has been called the ſlow progreſs of the expedition.</p>
            <p>In order to juſtify this charge, a view of the whole maſs has
been preſented to the public without any explanation of its diſtinct
allotments; and many have been led to believe, that the whole was attached to
the army throughout the campaign, and <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0652302600:16"/> fell into the enemy's
hands at laſt—The intention of this repreſentation is obvious: the
allegation is falſe.</p>
            <p>The facts, as I ſhall prove them to the committee, are as
follow. The whole origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal train furniſhed by Sir Guy Carleton conſiſted
of ſixteen heavy twenty-four poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; ten heavy twelve-pounders; eight
medium twelve-pounders; two light twenty-four pounders; one light
twelve-pounder; twenty-ſix light ſix pounders; ſeventeen light
three-pounders; ſix eight-inch howitzers; ſix five and a half inch
howitzers; two thirteen-inch mortars; two ten-inch mortars; ſix eight-inch
mortars; twelve five and a half-inch mortars; and twenty-four four and two
fifth-inch mortars. Of theſe two heavy twenty-four pounders were ſent on
board a ſhip for the defence of Lake Champlain, and the other fourteen were
ſent back to St. John's. Of the heavy twelve-pounders, ſix were left at
Ticonderoga, four ditto in the Royal George; four medium twelve-pounders at
Fort George; one light twelve-pounder at Ticonderoga; two light ſix-pounders
at Fort George; four light ſix-pounders at St. John's; four light
three-pounders at Ticonderoga; five light three-pounders at St. John's; two
eight-inch howitzers at Fort George; two ditto at St. John's; two five and a

George; two ten-inch mortars in ditto; four eight-inch mortars in ditto; four
five and a half inch mortars at Ticonderoga; four royal mortars in the Royal
George; twelve cohorns at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga; and eight cohorns in the Royal
George.</p>
            <p>The field-train therefore that proceeded with the army
conſiſted of four medium twelve-pounders; two light twenty-four pounders;
eighteen light ſix-pounders; ſix light three-pounders; two eight-inch
howitzers; four five and a half-inch howitzers; two eight-inch mortars, and
four royals.</p>
            <p>The carrying the twenty-four pounders (though they were but two)
has been ſpoken of as an error, and it is neceſſary therefore to inform
the committee that they were of a conſtruction lighter by 800 weight than
medium twelves, and to all intents and purpoſes field artillery.</p>
            <p>This artillery was diſtributed as follows.

                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>The line of Britiſh, four battalions</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0652302600:17"/>Germans, five battalions.</item>
                  <item>Total, nine battalions.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Three brigades of artillery, of four ſix-pounders each; viz. one
brigade for each wing, and one for the center.</p>
            <p>From hence it appears that to fourteen battalions there were
allotted twenty-ſix pieces of light artillery. The cuſtomary allotment is
two pieces per battalion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the proportion of artillery was
leſs than upon common ſervices.</p>
            <p>The forming artillery into brigades, in preference to detaching
two guns to each bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion, has been conſtantly practiſed in moſt
ſervices during laſt war under the ableſt men, and it is productive of
many advantages, as the brigades by that means, either ſingly or united, fall
under the command of a proportionable number of officers. The ſervice is
carried on with greater regularity, and the effect of the fire becomes much
more formidable than when ſcattered along the front of the line.</p>
            <p>This mode of ſervice was recommended by Major-general Phillips,
and adopted without heſitation by me, my own judgment being confirmed by an
officer of his great ſkill and experience.</p>
            <p>The park artillery conſiſted of ten pieces, viz. 
<list>
                  <item>2 light twenty-four pounders.</item>
                  <item>4 medium twelve-pounders.</item>
                  <item>2 eight-inch howitzers.</item>
                  <item>2 royal howitzers.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I underſtood this proportion of field artillery to be the ſame
as that propoſed by Sir Guy Carleton had he commanded; it was the proportion
recommended by General Phillips, and I formed my opinion conformably to the
ſentiments of thoſe reſpectable officers upon the following reaſons,
viz. that artillery was extremely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to raw troops; that in a country
of poſts it was eſſentially neceſſary againſt the beſt troops;
that it was yet more applicable to the enemy we were to combat, becauſe the
mode of defence they invariably adopted, and at which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all
other nations expert, was that of entrenchment covered with ſtrong abbatis,
againſt which the cannon, of the nature of the heavieſt above deſcribed,
and howit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers might often be effectual, when to diſlodge them by any other
means might be attended with continued and important loſſes.</p>
            <p>In theſe general ideas of the uſe of artillery againſt the
rebel forces, I have the happineſs to obſerve, from the papers before you,
the concurrence of Sir William Howe, who ſtates ſimilar ideas very fully in
one of his requiſitions to the ſecretary of ſtate: but further reaſons
for not diminiſhing the proportion of guns of ſuperior calibre to
ſix-pounders in this train, were, firſt, their uſe againſt
block-houſes (a ſpecies of fortification peculiar to America); ſecondly,
a probability that gun-boats might be requiſite for the ſecurity of the
water tranſport, on ſome parts of the <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0652302600:18"/> Hudſon's
River; but principally the intention of fortifying a camp at Albany, in caſe
I ſhould reach that place, ſhould meet with a ſufficiency of proviſion
there, (as I was led to expect) and ſhould find it expedient to paſs the
winter there, without communication with New-York.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the quantity of ammunition attached to this
artillery, it is to be obſerved, that the number of rounds accompanying the
light pieces, and which were carried in ſmall carts, were not more than
ſufficient for a day's action.

            <p>The different reſerves of ammunition were chiefly conveyed by
water in ſcows and batteaux; it certainly would not have been adviſable,
after a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Canada was at an end, to depend upon precarious

is probable, that recourſe muſt have been had to artillery of the heavier
nature; in the latter caſe eſpecially they muſt have been uſed in order
to derive any advantage from our ſeizing a poſt upon their left flank: I
have ſince known, that they had iron twelve and nine-pounders mounted upon
thoſe works, which were in other reſpects very formidable.

            <p>Add theſe numbers to the former ſtate of the army, and it will
be found, that the regular ſtrength when at the greateſt conſiſted of
7213.</p>
            <p>I come now to the ſecond period of the campaign, comprehending
the tranſactions from the time the purſuit of the enemy from Ticonderoga
ceaſed, and the corps of Brigadier-general Fraſer, and the 9th regiment,
rejoined the army, after the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive actions of Huberton and Fort Anne,
to the time when the army paſſed the Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's river to attack the enemy
near Still-Water.</p>
            <p>It had proved impoſſible immediately to follow the quick
retreat of the enemy farther, from the nature of the country, and the
neceſſity of waiting a freſh ſupply <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0652302600:19"/> of
proviſions. But it appeared evident to me, that could a rapid progreſs
towards Albany be effected, during their diſperſion and panic, it would be
deciſive on the ſucceſs of the expedition.</p>
            <p>Queſtion has been made by thoſe who began at this period to
arraign my military conduct, whether it would not have been more expedient for
the purpoſe of rapidity, to have fallen back to Ticonderoga, in order to take
the convenient route by Lake George, than to have perſevered in the laborious
and difficult courſe by land to Fort Edward? My motives for preferring the
latter were theſe: I conſidered not only the general impreſſions which
a retrograde motion is apt to make upon the minds both of enemies and friends,
but alſo, that the natural conduct of the enemy in that caſe would be to
remain at Fort George, as their retreat could not then be cut off, in order to
oblige me to open trenches, and conſequently to delay me, and in the mean
time they would have deſtroyed the road from Fort George to Fort Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. On
the other hand, by perſiſting to penetrate by the ſhort cut from Fort
Anne, of which I was then maſter, to Fort Edward, though it was attended with
great labour, and many alert ſituations, the troops were improved in the very
eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial point of wood ſervice; I effectually diſlodged the enemy
from Fort George without a blow; and ſeeing me maſter of one communication,
they did not think it worth while to deſtroy the other.</p>
            <p>The great number of boats alſo, which muſt neceſſarily
have been employed for the tranſport of the troops over Lake George, were by
this courſe ſpared for the tranſport of the proviſion, artillery, and
ammunition.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs anſwered this reaſoning in every point; for by
the vigilance of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Phillips, to whom I had committed the important
part of forwarding all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries from Ticonderoga, a great
embarkation arrived at Fort George on July 29th. I took poſſeſſion of
the country near Fort Edward on the ſame day, and independently of other
advantages, I found myſelf much more forward in point of time than I could
poſſibly have been by the other route.</p>
            <p>Another material motive, which could not be known by ſtrangers
who have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned upon this movement, was, that during the time that my army
was employed in clearing Wood-Creek and cutting roads, and the corps under
Major-general Phillips working to paſs the tranſports over Lake George, I
was enabled to detach a large corps to my left, under Major-general Reideſel,
and thereby aſſiſt my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of giving jealouſy to Connecticut, and
keeping in check the whole country called the Hampſhire Grants.</p>
            <p>It was at this time Major-general Reideſel conceived the
purpoſe of mounting his regiment of dragoons. In the country he traverſed
during his detached command, he found the people frightened and
ſubmiſſive. He was induſtrious and expert in <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0652302600:20"/>
procuring intelligence in parts of the country more remote than Bennington, and
entertained no doubt of ſucceſs, were an expedition formed under the
command of Lieutenant-colonel Baum.</p>
            <p>On the arrival of the army at Fort Edward, the great object of
attention was the tranſports from Fort George. The diſtance was about
ſixteen miles, the roads wanting great repair, the weather unfavourable, the
cattle and carriages ſcarce; part of the latter inconvenience was
occaſioned by the number of both that were neceſſarily detained at
Ticonderoga, for the purpoſe of dragging the boats and the proviſions over
the carrying places, between Lake Champlain and Lake George; another part of
the inconvenience was cauſed by the unavoidable delays, in bringing the
different diviſions of horſes as they were collected in Canada through the
deſart, for ſuch moſt of the country is between St. John's and
Ticonderoga.</p>
            <p>It was ſoon found, that in the ſituation of the tranſport
ſervice at that time, the army could barely be victualled from day to day,
and that there was no proſpect of eſtabliſhing a magazine in due time for
purſuing preſent advantages. The idea of the expedition to Bennington
originated upon this difficulty, combined with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence reported by
General Reideſel, and with all I had otherwiſe received.</p>
            <p>I knew that Bennington was the great depoſit of corn, flour, and
ſtore cattle; that it was guarded only by militia; and every day's account
tended to confirm the perſuaſion of the loyalty of one deſcription of the
inhabitants and the panic of the other. Thoſe who knew the country beſt
were the moſt ſanguine in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion.</p>
            <p>Had my intelligence been worſe founded, I ſhould not have
heſitated to try this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition with ſuch troops, and under ſuch
inſtructions as I gave to the commanding officer, for ſo great a purpoſe
as that of a ſupply ſufficient to enable the army to follow at the heels of
a broken and diſconcerted enemy. The German troops employed were of the
beſt I had of that nation. The number of Britiſh was ſmall; but it was
the ſelect light corps of the army, compoſed of choſen men from all the
regiments, and commanded by Captain Fraſer, one of the moſt
diſtinguiſhed officers in his line of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that ever I met with. The
inſtructions recommended the utmoſt caution reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſts and
ſecurity of retreat, attention againſt expoſing the ſolid part of the
detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to affront, or committing it in any inſtance, without a moral
certainty of ſucceſs. I touch with tenderneſs and with great reluctance
points that relate to the dead. My defence compels me to ſay, my cautions
were not obſerved, nor the reinforcement ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with the alacrity I had a
right to expect. The men who commanded in both inſtances were brave and
experienced officers. I have ever imputed their failure partly to deluſion in
reſpect to the enemy, and partly to ſurpriſe and conſequent confuſion
in the troops.</p>
            <p>For further explanation of my motives, and the circumſtances
attending the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0652302600:21"/> of the expedition, I beg leave to
refer the committee to the letter laid before the houſe laſt year, and more
particularly to the private letter laid before the houſe lately.<note n="*" place="margin">See Appendix No. VIII.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame letter will ſhew the only reſource that remained
for proceeding towards Albany, after the diſappointment of this expedition,
viz. to preſs forward a neceſſary ſupply of proviſion, and other
indiſpenſible articles, from Fort George. I ſhall bring proof to your bar
to this point, and I truſt I ſhall ſhew beyond a doubt, that no
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible exertion was omitted. It is not uncommon for gentlemen,
unacquainted with the peculiarities of the country to which I am alluding, to
calculate the tranſport of magazines, by meaſuring the diſtance upon a
map, and then applying the reſources of carriage, as practiſed in other
countries. I requeſt permiſſion to ſhew their miſtake. The firſt
ſtage from Fort George to Fort Edward is by land. The diſtance and the
roads were deſcribed before. At Fort Edward the Hudſon's River becomes
navigable for a certain extent, and it is the conſtant practice in all
tranſports to reſume the water carriage. Were it not, new impediments would
ariſe from hills, worſe roads, and ſuch an increaſed diſtance, as
would prevent the cattle returning to Fort George the ſame day. About ſix
miles below Fort Edward lie the falls of Fort Miller, where there is another
carrying-place, which, though of no conſiderable length, makes it
neceſſary to unload the boats, to place the contents in carts, and to
replace them in freſh boats, at the place the river again admits of
navigation. The boats unloaded, return to Fort Edward againſt a rapid
ſtream.</p>
            <p>Upon this ſhort ſtate of facts, gentlemen will judge of our
embarraſſments. In the firſt place, it was neceſſary to bring forward
to Fort Edward fourſcore or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred boats, as mere carriage-veſſels
for the proviſions, each boat made a hard day's work for ſix or more
horſes, including the return of the horſes. At the next carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place, as
above deſcribed, it was neceſſary to place a conſiderable relay of
horſes to draw over, firſt, a portion of carriage boats, and afterwards the
proviſion, as it arrived. I have not mentioned the great number of other
boats neceſſary to be brought forward, to form bridges, to carry baggage
and ammunition, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of carriages framed to tranſport the boats
themſelves at the enſuing carrying-places, as we ſhould proceed to
Albany. This will be ſhewn in detail at the bar, if the committee chuſe to
hear it; and I pledge myſelf, it will appear, that the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in this
ſervice was extreme; that it was performed in the moſt expeditious manner
poſſible, regard being had to our reſources, and that no delay was
occaſioned by the artillery, becauſe the horſes appropriated to it were
ſupernumerary to thoſe for which we had carts, and the artillery, not
already with the army, at laſt was all brought up by its own horſes in two
days.</p>
            <p>On the 13th of September, the ſtore of proviſion, amounting to
about thirty day's conſumption, was completed. I have ſtated, in my letter
to the ſecretary of ſtate, my reaſons againſt proceeding with leſs
quantity. And it is now time to enter upon <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0652302600:22"/> the
conſideration of that object, which is held by ſome to be concluſive upon
the executive part of the campaign, the paſſage of the Hudſon's
River.</p>
            <p>Two errors, reſpecting this paſſage, though of oppoſite
and incompatible natures, are ſuppoſed to have contributed to the ill
ſucceſs that enſued; the one, the error of delay, the other, that of
precipitation. In defence againſt the firſt, I refer to my effort at
Bennington to procure ſupplies, and to the impediments, I have juſt now
ſtated, after that effort failed. Againſt the latter, I refer to the
reaſons laid down in my private letter to the ſecretary of ſtate, dated
20th of Auguſt. 
<note n="*" place="margin">See Appendix No. IX.</note>The ſtate of
things at this important criſis, and my reaſoning upon it, are
expreſſed ſtill more at large in my diſpatch from Albany; I will now
only touch them ſhortly. On the one hand, my communications were at an end;
my retreat was inſecure; the enemy was collected in force; they were
ſtrongly poſted; Colonel St. Leger was retiring from Fort Stanwix. Theſe
were difficulties, but none of them inſurmountable. On the other hand, I had
diſlodged the enemy repeatedly, when before in force, and more ſtrongly
poſted; my army was conſcious of having the ſuperiority, and eager to
advance; I expected co-operation; no letters from Sir William Howe removed that
expectation; that to Sir Guy Carleton had never weighed upon my mind, becauſe
it was dated early in April, and conſequently long before the ſecretary of
ſtate's inſtructions, which I muſt have ſuppoſed to relate to
co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, could be received. The letter of 17th July,<note n="*" place="margin">No. X.</note> mentioned that General's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my
aſſiſtance, ſhould Waſhington turn his force towards me; indicated,
as I thought, an expectation of my arrival at Albany; and informed me, that Sir
Henry Clinton was left at New-York, and would act as occurrences might direct.
I did <hi>not</hi> know Sir Henry Clinton's force. I <hi>did</hi> know, that
conſiderable reinforcement might be then expected at New-York from England.
After all, ſhould co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from below fail, the whole force of Colonel
St. Leger, and Sir William John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was to be expected from above, in time
to facilitate a retreat, though not in time to aſſiſt my advance. Under
theſe different ſuggeſtions, and thoſe that are more copiouſly
ſtated in the diſpatch, to which I have referred, I read again my orders (I
believe for an hundredth time) and I was decided.</p>
            <p>And I am ſtill convinced, that no proof that could have been
brought from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, intelligence or reaſoning, could have juſtified
me to my country, have ſaved me from the condemnation of my profeſſion,
or produced pardon within my own breaſt, had I not advanced, and tried a
battle with the enemy.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this ſubject, with again aſſerting upon my
honour, what I hope to ſupport by evidence, though it is impoſſible to
bring poſitive proof to a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that neither General Fraſer, nor
General Phillips, ever offered, as has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, nor can be ſuppoſed
to have conceived any objection againſt the paſſage of the Hudſon's
River.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0652302600:23"/> This reſolution being taken, I truſt, the
manner of approaching the enemy, when explained by witneſſes, will not be
diſgraceful to me as a ſoldier. The action, which enſued on the 19th of
September, verified my opinion of the valour of my army; and I muſt, in
truth, acknowledge, a very reſpectable ſhare of that quality in the army of
the enemy. To the general deſcription given in my diſpatch, it will be fit
to add, by evidence, the peculiar merits of the troops in that action. The
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of three Britiſh regiments, in continual and cloſe fire for four
hours, all of them ſuffering conſiderable loſs, and one remaining with
leſs than ſixty men, and four or five officers, ought not to loſe its due
applauſe, becauſe it is ſaid, their opponents were irregulars and
militia.</p>
            <p>A victory was at laſt obtained, but the cloſe of day
unavoidably prevented any immediate advantages. On the day following, it was
known from priſoners and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters, that the enemy were in a poſt
ſtrongly fortified; but from the thickneſs of the wood, it was
impoſſible to catch a view of any part of their poſition. All that could
be done, therefore, was to take up ground as near them, as the nature of the
country would admit with regard to military arrangement. It appears from the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch already alluded to, that the army remained in this poſition till
the 9th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when the ſecond action enſued, employed in fortifying
their camp, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy, whoſe numbers it was now known, had been
greatly ſuperior to ours in the action.</p>
            <p>It may here be aſked, why, as ſoon as it became palpable that
no uſe could be made of the victory, I did not retreat?</p>
            <p>It will be ſhewn, that on the ſecond day after the action, I
received intelligence from Sir Henry Clinton, of his intention to attack the
highlands about that time, and I was hourly in expectation, I thought a
juſtly founded one, of that meaſure operating to diſlodge Mr. Gates
entirely, or to oblige him to detach a large portion of his force. Either of
theſe caſes would probably have opened my way to Albany. In theſe
circumſtances, could the preference upon theſe alternatives admit of a
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's reflection? To wait ſo fair a proſpect of effecting at laſt the
great purpoſe of the campaign, or to put a victorious army, under all the
diſadvantages of a beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en one, by a difficult and diſgraceful retreat;
relinquiſhing the long expected co-operation, in the very hour of its
promiſe, and leaving Sir Henry Clinton's army, and probably Sir William
Howe's, expoſed, with ſo much of the ſeaſon of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign to run, to
the whole force of Mr. Gates, after he ſhould have ſeen me on the other
ſide of Hudſon's River.</p>
            <p>Some of the ſame conſiderations, and other concomitant
circumſtances, will, in part, ſerve to account for my not attacking the
enemy during this interval; for in this ſituation, as in former ones, my
conduct has been arraigned upon oppoſite principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0652302600:24"/> The committee will obſerve, that after
receiving intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's deſign, different
meſſengers were diſpatched by different routes, to inform that officer of
my ſituation, and of the time I thought I could continue in it. To have
hazarded a repulſe, under ſo reaſonable an expectation of a powerful
diverſion, would, in my opinion, have been very unjuſtifiable; but when I
add, that from the backwardneſs, or defection, of the few Indians that
remained, the numbers of rifle-men, and other irregulars employed on the
enemy's out-poſts, and the ſtrength and darkneſs of the ſurrounding
woods, it had not yet been practicable to gain any competent knowledge of their
poſition, I truſt every man will go with me in the ſentiment, that all
theſe circumſtances conſidered, an attack would have been conſummate
raſhneſs.</p>
            <p>Another very powerful reaſon, that operated on the ſide of
delay, was the ſtate of my ſick and wounded. Numbers of the latter were
recovering faſt; many excellent officers in particular; and the more I
delayed the ſtronger I grew. The time alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled me to expect
Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger's corps would be arrived at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, and
ſecret means had been long concerted to enable him to make an effort to join
me, with probability of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Upon mature conſideration of theſe and other circumſtances
attending this period, come to my knowledge ſince, I am clearly of opinion,
that had the reinforcements from England arrived in time, to have enabled Sir
Henry Clinton to have effected the ſtroke he afterwards ſo gallantly made
in the highlands, any time between the two actions, I ſhould have made my
way.</p>
            <p>The diſpatch alluded to, proceeds to ſtate the reaſon that
induced me to make the movement on the 7th October. I ſhall only add, to
obviate a ſuppoſed error, in not advancing my whole line, that the part
remaining in my camp, operated as effectually to keep the enemy's right wing in
check, from ſupporting their left, as if it had moved, with this additional
advantage, that it prevented the danger of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing by the plain, near
the river, and falling upon my rear.</p>
            <p>I have reaſon to believe my diſappointment on that day
proceeded from an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon circumſtance in the conduct of the enemy. Mr.
Gates, as I have been informed, had determined to receive the attack in his
lines; Mr. Arnold, who commanded on the left, forſeeing the danger of being
turned, advanced without conſultation with his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and gave, inſtead
of receiving battle. The ſtroke might have been fatal on his part had he
failed. But confident I am, upon minute examination of the ground ſince, that
had the other idea been purſued, I ſhould in a few hours have gained a
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that in ſpite of the enemy's numbers, would have put them in my
power.</p>
            <p>Diſagreeable as is the neceſſity, I muſt here again, in
juſtice to my own army, recur to the vigour and obſtinacy with which they
were fought by the enemy. A more deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined perſeverance than they ſhewed
in the attack upon the lines, though they were <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0652302600:25"/> finally
repulſed by the corps under Lord Balcarras, I believe, is not in any
officer's experience. It will be the buſineſs of evidence to prove, that in
the part, where Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Breyman was killed, and the enemy penetrated, the
miſchief could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, nor under it the camp be longer tenable.</p>
            <p>The tranſactions of the enſuing night, the day of the eighth,
and the whole progreſs of the retreat to Saratoga, will be laid before the
committee minutely in the courſe of my evidence, as well as every
circumſtance, from the time the army arrived there to the ſigning the
convention. I have only to premiſe, that, I truſt, I ſhall be able to
prove, to the ſatisfaction of the committee, that even in this ſituation, I
had the chance of a favourable event. The enemy had intended to attack by the
plain of Saratoga. On the morning of the 11th, a conſiderable column had
actually paſſed the Fiſh Kill for that purpoſe during the fog, which at
that ſeaſon was regular till ſometime after ſun riſe. The intention
was prevented taking place, by intelligence one of their generals received from
a deſerter, that I had a line formed behind the bruſh-wood, to ſupport
the poſt of artillery, which was their immediate object of attack. The
general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly retreated his column, and prevented a general action,
which my poſition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the propoſed one of the enemy, gave me
reaſon to hope would have been to my advantage.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe a ſatisfactory confidence, that I ſhall
demonſtrate that the intelligence I ſtated to the councils of war,
reſpecting the ſtrength of the enemy, did not fall ſhort in any part, and
in ſome parts much exceeded my own belief, particularly on the only
poſſible routes of my retreat; and that thoſe poſts were not taken up
during my ſtay at Saratoga, as has been reported, but ſome of them previous
to the action of the 7th, and the reſt immediately after it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe the whole of this by delivering at your table,
from the hands of my ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, an authenticated return of the force of
General Gates, ſigned by himſelf, and the truth of it will be ſupported
from ocular teſtimony, by every officer of the Britiſh army. Many of them
are now in England, and after what has been inſinuated, not to ſay charged
in this Houſe, it becomes the duty of the accuſers, not only to examine
cloſely the officers I have called, but to produce any other witneſſes,
that in their thoughts may be qualified to ſpeak to the good or bad order of
the rebel troops, when they marched by in their preſence, and to their
behaviour, when oppoſed to our troops in action.</p>
            <p>I cannot cloſe this long treſpaſs upon the patience of the
committee, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing one humble hope, that in forming a judgment
upon the whole, or any diſtinct part of theſe tranſactions, they will be
conſidered as they muſt have appeared at the time; for, I believe, where
war is concerned, few men in command would ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0652302600:26"/> if any after-knowledge of facts and circumſtances were
brought in argument againſt deciſions of the moment, and apparent
exigencies of the occaſion.</p>
            <p>I ſubmit all I have ſaid, ſome of it, I fear, not
ſufficiently prepared or arranged, with true reſpect to the committee. I
ſhall not mention <hi>all</hi> the diſadvantages, under which I have
preſſed this buſineſs upon their attention. I have cauſe to regret
the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a moſt confidential friend in Major General Phillips;
zealous advocates, I truſt, in Major General Reideſel and Brigadier
Hamilton. Much of my vindication is in the grave with General Fraſer; much
with Colonel Ackland your late member. I truſt my zeal, in promoting this
enquiry, as I have done, will be one mark of the ſenſe I bear of the
general character of this houſe; that however men may be biaſſed by
political attachments upon common occaſions, when the honour of an individual
is committed to their hands, they will alone be guided by truth and juſtice.
And the next inference I ſhould wiſh to be drawn, from my earneſtneſs
for a public appeal, is this; that however others may impute errors to my
conduct, I am myſelf conſcious of the rectitude of my intentions.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1.</note>Q. DO you recollect having received

it expedient for you to remain in the province of Quebec?</p> 
                     <p>A. Yes, very well.</p>

                     <p>A. I think the 12th of Auguſt, 1776—I am ſure it was
in Auguſt.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">3.</note>Q. Was not the date of that letter
long before the return of General Burgoyne from Canada to Great Britain?</p> 
                     <p>A. Yes.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">4.</note>Q. During the winter, preceding the

General Burgoyne for field ſervice more than was intended, had you ſo
commanded?</p> 
                     <p>A. I don't preciſely recollect that—It does not ſtrike
me there was any great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>

                        <note place="margin">6.</note>Q. Was the quantity of artillery
decided on in concert with Major-General Phillips, and on his
recommendation?</p> 
                     <p>A. The artillery I had prepared for the campaign, on a
ſuppoſition I was to go my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was in concert with General Phillips.
That department, as well as others, was put under the command of General
Burgoyne on his arrival; and, I ſuppoſe, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſame method
ſo far as regarded the artillery.</p> 
                     <p>

take that train of artillery with you that you have mentioned, it was with a
view to the reduction of the forts at Ticonderoga; or whether you propoſed to
have taken with you the ſame train of artillery in caſe you had marched
forward in the country toward Albany?</p> 
                     <p>A. It was with an intention to reduce the forts and lines at
Ticonderoga; the train of artillery was calculated for that ſervice.</p>

reduced Ticonderoga and marched forwards towards Albany, have carried with you
a train of field artillery?</p> 
                     <p>A. I probably ſhould have taken artillery with me.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">15.</note>Q. Had you foreſeen a
neceſſity of fortifying a camp at Albany, would you not have carried ſome
guns of the calibre of twelve pounders and light twenty-fours?</p> 
                     <p>A. It is really a very difficult matter off hand to run into all
the minute operations of a campaign; every meaſure of that ſort muſt have
been a matter of conſideration and deliberation, and there are a thouſand
circumſtances that might have determined me upon the ſpot—I don't
wiſh to conceal from this Houſe any thing that I would have done—but
I hope they will conſider, that every gentleman may have different ideas of
the ſtate and ſituation of the army, as expreſſed by the queſtion
aſked, and the leaſt inaccuracy of expreſſion on my part may convey
ideas very different from what I could wiſh—In general, ſo
conſiderable a corps as that was, very ſeldom moves without artillery, but
the preciſe number muſt depend on a variety of circumſtances, which the
diſcretion and judgment of the officer who commands muſt determine.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">16.</note>Q. Were not the orders you received

dated the 5th of April, from Sir William Howe, informing you that he could not
ſend any force to aſſiſt the operations of General Burgoyne's army?</p>

                     <p>A. I received a letter from Sir William Howe relative to his
operations, a copy of which was ſent to General Burgoyne—I think it was
not juſt in thoſe terms, but a copy of the letter is on the table.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0652302600:29"/>
                        <note place="margin">18.</note>Q. Whether on
that information, you conſidered that you had any diſcretionary power to
detain General Burgoyne after that information?</p> 
                     <p>A. Certainly not.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">19.</note>Q. Whether in caſe of any
difficulty that General Burgoyne might meet with on his march, there was any
latitude given to him (General Burgoyne) to retreat?</p> 
                     <p>A. I ſaid before, that the orders were before the Houſe, who
are competent to judge on that point.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">20.</note>Q. Did you yourſelf underſtand
thoſe orders to General Burgoyne to be poſitive?</p>

Canada, under your command, not to proceed?</p> 
                     <p>A. I ſhould have taken care that General Burgoyne met with no

commander in chief of the troops in the northern diviſion, extend beyond the
boundaries of Canada to Ticonderoga?</p> 
                     <p>A. That commiſſion as commander in chief, I underſtood,
did extend ſo far; but by the orders already alluded to, or by thoſe which
General Burgoyne brought out in the ſpring 1777, I underſtood that my
command was reſtrained to the limits of the province, and that General
Burgoyne was entirely from under my command, as ſoon as he paſſed the
limits of the province.</p>

of ſtate for a reinforcement of 4000 men, as neceſſary for the campaign
of 1777?</p> 
                     <p>A. I recollect when General Burgoyne was coming home in the fall
of 1776, as I was perfectly ſatisfied with his conduct in the preceding
campaign, I talked over with him, in confidence, what I thought neceſſary
for the following campaign; among other things I deſired him to make a
memorandum to demand 4000 men, as a reinforcement for the enſuing campaign,
or at leaſt for four battalions. I think I have ſeen thoſe memorandums
were accurately ſtated and laid before the Houſe.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">27.</note>Q. What part of that 4000 men which
you thought neceſſary for the campaign of 1777, was actually ſent out to
Canada in that year?</p> 
                     <p>A. I do not accurately remember how many—I think a very
ſmall part—You may have a very preciſe account from the returns.</p>

had received your orders from the ſecretary of ſtate, did you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that General Burgoyne, as long as he was within the province of Canada, was
poſitively under your command?</p> 
                     <p>A. Yes, I did: as long as he was in the province of Canada, I
looked on him to be poſitively under my command; but the load of the
expedition being on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I thought it proper that he, in all
things ſhould direct; and therefore I gave out immediate orders, that not
only the troops he was to command out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but all the departments
neceſſary for the aſſiſting his expedition, ſhould comply
immediately, and without delay, with every requiſition and order he ſhould
give. The reaſon of my doing ſo was, that no time might be loſt. I only
required that they ſhould report to me what orders they had received from
General Burgoyne. I believe thoſe orders are alſo on the table.</p>

                     </p> 
                     <p>A. I had no particular meaning; they are words I ſhould have
uſed on any expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of importance.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">31.</note>Q. If General Burgoyne had met with

Burgoyne, through you, from the ſecretary of ſtate?</p> 
                     <p>A. Had there been any difficulties in Canada, I would not have

                        <note place="margin">32.</note>Q. Having given up the command to
General Burgoyne, and having ordered all the troops to obey him, only reporting
their proceedings to you, would you after that, have thought yourſelf
juſtifiable to change the order to General Burgoyne, upon his meeting with
great difficulties on the frontiers of the neighbouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces?</p> 
                     <p>A. I really did not mean to evade the queſtion in the leaſt.
It did not appear to me poſſible that there could be any difficulties. I
don't mean to ſay there could not, from the nature of the country, be
difficulties in the march that might occaſion delay, but by the nature of the
queſtion I underſtood difficulties from the enemy. In that caſe I
ſhould not have thought myſelf juſtifiable in giving up the command.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">33.</note>Q. If you had heard, that on the
frontiers, and within the province of Canada, there was the greateſt reaſon
to think, that the reſiſtance of General Burgoyne's army was ſo great as
to make it, in your opinion, exceedingly difficult for that General to force
his way to Albany, would you think yourſelf juſtifiable in giving different
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to General Burgoyne, from thoſe given by the ſecretary of ſtate;
or would you have thought the ſecretary of ſtate's orders for General
Burgoyne's army ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory that it would not be proper for you to
interfere?</p> 
                     <p>A. If I underſtood the queſtion as it now ſtands, it is
what I would have done, had the province been invaded, or cloſe on the point
of being invaded, and the enemy entering the province.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">34.</note>Q. The queſtion does not mean an
invading army, but a reſiſtance from the enemy to the progreſs of General
Burgoyne's army, in the caſe ſtated in the laſt queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p> 
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0652302600:31"/>A. In that caſe, that an enemy ſhould be
found (within the limits of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) I ſhould have ordered all the troops
deſtined for the defence of the province, to have immediately joined thoſe
deſtined for General Burgoyne, and have reaſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the command of all,
until thoſe obſtructions had been removed, within the limits of my
authority.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">35.</note>Q. Suppoſe no enemy within the
province of Canada, but poſted in ſuch a manner upon the line of
communication with Albany, as to make it exceeding difficult for General
Burgoyne to obey the orders given to him, would you think yourſelf
juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable in giving different orders to General Burgoyne, from thoſe
given by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of ſtate; or would you have thought the ſecretary
of ſtate's orders for General Burgoyne's army ſo peremptory that it would
not be proper for you to interfere?</p> 
                     <p>A. I could not change General Burgoyne's orders one tittle, that
was my opinion; he received his orders from the ſame power that gave me my
authority; when once he paſſed the limits of my command, I neither could
give him orders, nor would he be juſtified in obeying them.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">36.</note>Q. Do you mean the latter part of
that anſwer as an anſwer to a queſtion which ſuppoſes General
Burgoyne within the limits of the province of Canada?</p> 
                     <p>A. No: while he was within the limits of the province of Canada,
I would have given General Burgoyne orders in all caſes of difficulty and
danger. There being no ſuch caſe when General Burgoyne arrived in Canada,
in 1777, nor a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of an event of that ſort, I put the troops
and all things under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which concerned his expedition, that he
might arrange and combine their motions according to his own plan of operation
for the campaign, that no time might be loſt by any unneceſſary
applications to me, which the ſtrict forms of my command might otherwiſe
require.</p>

General Burgoyne's ſituation, and acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the orders which you know he
received, have thought yourſelf bound to purſue them implicitly, or at
liberty to deviate from them?</p> 
                     <p>A. I ſhould certainly have thought myſelf bound to have
obeyed them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my power; but, to ſay as a military man, that
in all caſes poſſible, I muſt have gone on, is a very nice thing to
ſay indeed; it muſt have thrown me, and I ſuppoſe every officer, into a
moſt unpleaſant and anxious ſituation, to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated within himſelf,
whether he was or was not to go on. Every man muſt decide for himſelf. What
I would have done, I really don't know; the particular ſituation, and a man's
own particular feelings, muſt determine the point. If I might be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I
would beg leave to ſay, that I did not mean to evade any queſtion; I meant
to anſwer directly; yet queſtions may be put to me, of ſo delicate a
nature, and perhaps no man in the world is in a more delicate ſituation, with
reſpect to the preſent caſe in queſtion, and the buſineſs of this
Committee, than I am; when ſuch queſtions are put to me, I ſhall pray the
indulgence of the Committee, to be excuſed anſwering <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0652302600:32"/>
them, but I will not evade them. As I now underſtand the meaning of the right
honourable member in the former queſtions to be, Whether I ſhould have
taken upon me to ſuperſede the King's orders, ſuppoſing I knew of any
unſurmountable difficulties in the way, as that I had information of 20,000
men at Ticonderoga, before General Burgoyne left the province of Canada, I
ſhould have told General Burgoyne my information? But it was General Burgoyne
who was to carry the orders into execution, and not me, and therefore it was
upon his own judgment he was to determine; I ſhould have given him my
opinion, but I think I had no right to give him orders under thoſe
circumſtances.</p>

arrangement and diſtribution of the troops that were to be left for the

Burgoyne?</p> 
                     <p>A. The orders that are before the Houſe are very full, and I

brought back the firſt propoſition, wherein it was ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by Major
General Gates, that the army ſhould lay down their arms in their
entrenchments and ſurrender priſoners of war, does your Lordſhip
remember, that General Burgoyne, when he read them to the council, declared, he
would not ſet his hand to thoſe conditions, or words to that effect?</p> 
                        <p>A. I think the words of the propoſal from General Gates
were, That the Britiſh army ſhould be ordered, by word of command from
their adjutant general, to lay down their arms in the entrenchments. It was
rejected with diſdain by General Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, and the council concurred in his
indignation.</p>

whether it was conſiſtent with public faith, and if ſo, expedient to
ſuſpend the execution of the treaty and truſt to events?</p>

                           <note place="margin">75.</note>Q. From the manner and ſilence

                        <p>A. They marched in good order and were ſilent, and ſeemed
to pay attention to their officers. Theſe are eſſential points of
diſcipline, but I ſaw nothing farther of it.</p>

                        <p>A. When I anſwered the laſt queſtion, I ſpoke to the

                        <p>A. It requires great experience to make a computation of

they ſeemed to me to amount to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fourteen thouſand rank and file

ſtated to their Sovereign, by the general in perſon who had the honour of

                        <p>A. It was the wiſh of that army that General Burgoyne
ſhould go to Europe, to juſtify not only his own conduct, but the conduct
of the army he commanded.</p>

                        <p>A. General Burgoyne, at all times, ſhared the dangers and

on him as their friend, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would have received him in perſon, or
any accounts of him, with every mark of affection.</p>

there have been any occaſion to have attacked the poſt at Pitch Pine Plains
at all?</p> 
                        <p>A. The army did proceed by South Bay, excepting a detachment
of General Fraſer's corps, and ſome Germans to ſupport him; and the army
aſſembled at Skeneſborough on the 9th or 10th of July.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">91.</note>Q. Was it neceſſary to go to
the poſt at Pitch Pine Plains, in order to go to South Bay?</p> 
                        <p>A. They had no ſort of connection with each other.</p>

                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0652302600:42"/>A. There were two routes to Fort Edward.
General Burgoyne might ſtill go the ſame route without any neceſſity of
attacking that poſt, as there might have been many different ways of
diſlodging the enemy from that poſt without attacking it.</p>

that they always marched out of them and attacked us.</p>

enemy was ſuch as to make advantages obtained by them over his Majeſty's
troops more humiliating and diſgraceful to the Britiſh arms than the ſame
advantages obtained by an equal number of any other troops?</p> 
                        <p>A. I myſelf felt more humiliation until I conſidered that
thoſe advantages proceeded from the nature of the country, and not from the
want of zeal or bravery in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh troops.</p>

                        <p>A. The advantages gained by the rebels over the Britiſh
troops proceeded from their local ſituation, and not from the want of courage
in the Britiſh troops. We were taught by experience that neither their
attacks nor reſiſtance was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.</p>

the army under General Burgoyne, in general, expected co-operation in their
efforts to go to Albany, from the army under the command of Sir William
Howe?</p> 
                        <p>A. General Burgoyne gave it out in general orders, that he had
every reaſon to believe that powerful armies were acting in co-operation with

proviſion to enable him to proceed with the army.—I do recollect to
have heard him ſay with very great earneſtneſs to General Phillips and
Colonel Carleton, that one month's proviſion at that particular time (it was
about the latter end of Auguſt) would be worth 100,000l. to Great
Britain.</p>

                           <note place="margin">18.</note>Q. Do you think that the
commiſſary of the waggons, and other carriages, was authoriſed to buy or
hire ox-teams wherever they could be had, and that all draught cattle taken,
were appropriated to the tranſport?</p> 
                        <p>A. He received ſuch directions.</p>

                           <note place="margin">19.</note>Q. How many carts and ox-teams
could be muſtered at any one time? </p> 
                        <p>A. I think only 180 carts could at any one time be muſtered;
the number of ox-carts I really forget, but I believe between 20 and 30.</p>

proviſion for the troops, and all other perſons fed from the King's
ſtores, could that number of carriages convey?</p> 
                        <p>A. There never was any trial made, but if I may preſume to
judge from the proportion brought forward, over and above the daily
conſumption of the army, ſhould ſuppoſe all thoſe carriages would not
carry more than four days proviſions at moſt. I am ſpeaking at random, as
no trial was made.</p>

bateaux at the upper falls of Fort Miller, and a ſecond time unloading them
at the lower falls, dilatory as it was, a more expeditious method than it would
have been to have carried the proviſions the whole way in carts?</p> 
                        <p>A. I do apprehend it was not poſſible, in the feeble
ſtate I found the horſes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by contract, to have brought forward
the daily conſumption of proviſions for that army down to Fort Miller. In
the month of Auguſt, in the latter end of that month, at which time I was
appointed a commiſſary general of horſe, I made, on <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0652302600:49"/>
the firſt of September, a general muſter, and found 30 horſes
unſerviceable, from fatigue and hard labour.</p>

proviſions at any time impeded by the bringing forward the artillery from
Fort George?</p> 
                        <p>A. The artillery had a ſeparate contract for horſes, with
which they brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their own ſtores. I don't recollect that any part
of the proviſion train were ever employed in bringing forward artillery or
artillery ſtores.</p>

than myſelf, who ſerved under General Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, I hope no military man
will think me preſuming to give my opinion on that ſubject. I do think that
we could not have attacked the right wing of the rebel entrenchments without
riſking the loſs of the whole army, and with little probability of
ſucceſs.</p>

calling to them for ſhame, to continue their rank, they marched away to their

the artillery quitted their ground as ſoon as the firing began, and, to the
beſt of my recollection, I did not ſee they left a man behind them on the

make a ſtand in the rear of the artillery, but in no order.</p>

                        <p>A. I did not ſee General Reideſel endeavour to ſtop the
battalion; but I ſaw an aid du camp of his and a brigade major, with their
drawn ſwords, keeping them up. I did ſee General Reideſel immediately
afterwards, on the right of the artillery, with the battalion perfectly formed,

on that ſpot was taken, and yourſelf and Major Williams being made

                        <p>A. I believe it contributed, in ſome meaſure, towards the

wounds, he told me that he received his wound in bringing orders for the

of the artillery, if not the loſs of the whole army?</p>

                        <p>A. The ground alluded to was entrenched, and commanded the

                        <p>A. I did hear that General Arnold had marched out on the 7th
of October, without orders from General Gates. I did alſo hear that he
adviſed the going out to meet Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Burgoyne on his march, and engaging
him before he approached their lines; and the reaſon he gave was this: If
General Burgoyne ſhould ever come near enough their lines to be able to make
uſe of his artillery, that he would certainly poſſeſs himſelf of
their camp; that their troops in that caſe would never ſtand any where; but
if, on the other hand, the rebels ſhould be defeated in the woods, the troops
would, after that, have confidence in their works, for which reaſon Arnold
adviſed riſking an action in the woods before General Burgoyne came near
enough to fee their works.</p>

Fraſer's opinion on your foraging to the right?</p> 
                        <p>A. I do know that General Fraſer mentioned to me, on the 5th
of October, that there was forage on the right of his camp; but at that time
the ground on which that forage was to be met with was in poſſeſſion of
the rebels' advanced poſt.</p>

have been loſt, if even the expedition from New York had taken place a few
days ſooner?</p> 
                        <p>A. If the troops had arrived at New York ſoon enough to have
enabled Sir Henry Clinton to have made his expedition up the North River a week
ſooner, I do conceive that our army would not have been loſt.</p>

                        <p>A. I was not acquainted enough with the rebel leaders, to hear
their opinion on that queſtion. I do not think that the peaſants of the
country were judges of the propriety of Sir William Howe's conduct.</p>

                        <p>A. They did think that the alternative of retreating with
their army to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, or proceeding to Stillwater, under the neceſſity of
giving up his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, to be an unfortunate ſituation; but I never
heard any officers ſay that they thought General Burgoyne had done wrong;
many ſaid, that if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated without riſking an action, at the
time Sir Henry Clinton was coming up the North River, the army would never have
forgiven him, nor would he ever have forgiven himſelf.</p>

                        <p>A. Whatever opinion was formed of Sir William Howe's
expedition to Penſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, or is formed previous to this enquiry, ſuch an

thought it their indiſpenſible duty to paſs over Hudſon's

                        <p>A. If the Hudſon's River had not been there, the army would
have thought it their indiſpenſible duty to have gone and riſked an
action before they returned to Canada. If I recollect right, I ſaid, that if
the army had returned to Canada, without fighting, that the army would never
have forgiven the general, nor the general have forgiven himſelf.</p>

                        <p>A. The army could not have taken that route, as part of the
way was a ſwamp, and on the right of the rebel entrenchments was a mountain
very rugged, and not paſſable nearer than two miles from the river.</p>

                        <p>A. I think I have ſaid the army could not take that route;
if the army had marched on the eaſt of the Hudſon's River, they could not
have marched near enough to have covered their proviſion bateaux from the
rebel force, on the weſt ſide of the river.</p>

                           <note place="margin">71.</note>Q. How many days march from Fort

                        <p>A. I cannot anſwer that queſtion, unleſs I am to
ſuppoſe that a bridge was ready formed for the troops to paſs over, on
ſome part of Hudſon's River, between Batten Kill and Fort Edward, or that
there were veſſels ready to tranſport the troops over Hudſon's

between Fort Edward and Albany, that the army could not carry proviſions with
them to ſupport them during the march?</p> 
                        <p>A. Certainly Albany is not at ſo great a diſtance from
Fort Edward, but that a corps of troops might certainly carry proviſions
ſufficient for the march to Albany.</p>

                           <note place="margin">73.</note>Q. Was it not underſtood, that
if you had arrived at Albany, that the army would find plenty of proviſions
there?</p> 
                        <p>A. It was generally believed, and I believe it myſelf
firmly, that if the army had got to Albany, we ſhould have found a number of
loyal ſubjects, that would have joined and done every thing in their power to
have eſtabliſhed the army at that place.</p>

                        <p>A. There was no paſſing the river well without a bridge of
boats, and there were not ſcouls enough on that river, to make a bridge.</p>

                           <note place="margin">75.</note>Q. Would not the neceſſary

                        <p>A. I ſhould think it would.</p>

the enemy being on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſhore, would certainly have oppoſed
General Burgoyne's army croſſing the Hudſon's River at Albany, the river

the army, and I own I was one of the number, who feared that he would put that
threat in execution. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of policy, I believe alone, prevented him from
it; and if he had not pardoned the man, which he did, I believe the total
defection of the Indians would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and the conſequences, on their

they would have thrown into the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſcale, had they gone over to the

that the expedition to Bennington was much deſired by General Reideſel, and
that it was his wiſh to have it conducted by Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel Baume?</p> 
                        <p>A. It was always imagined in the army, that it was his wiſh,
and that Colonel Baume was appointed to the command of it in compliment to
him.</p>

                           <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0652302600:58"/>A. I was often with General Fraſer, and
he frequently talked without reſerve upon matters which he was not
particularly bound to conceal. There were certain matters of intelligence which
it would have been improper for him to mention to any body. In this caſe I
cannot boaſt ſo much of his confidence, as to ſuppoſe that he would
have opened his mind to me on matters which he would have concealed from the

                           <note place="margin">35.</note>Q. Do you know or believe that
the idea of forcing our way to Albany was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent throughout the army?</p> 
                        <p>A. In every converſation I had with different officers of
the army, I never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber once to have heard it doubted, but that we were to
force our way.</p>

                           <note place="margin">36.</note>Q. Did the army paſs the
Hudſon's River with alacrity? </p> 
                        <p>A. It is impoſſible for any army to have been in higher
ſpirits than they were at that time, or more deſirous of coming to an
engagement with the enemy.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">37.</note>Q. Do you not conceive, that to
have remained poſted behind the Hudſon's River, at the time the army
paſſed it and advanced, would have caſt a damp on the ſpirits of that
army and a reflection on their General?</p> 
                        <p>A. From the eagerneſs of the army to advance and the great
uneaſineſs that was diſcernible through it on every delay, I apprehended
that it could not have been otherwiſe; and I think that General Burgoyne's
character would not have ſtood very high either with the army, this country,
or the enemy, had he halted at Fort Edward.</p>

                           <note place="margin">38.</note>Q. Do you recollect the march up

                        <p>A. I do.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">39.</note>Q. Will you pleaſe to
deſcribe it? </p> 
                        <p>A. The army marched in three diviſions; the German line
flanking, the artillery and baggage purſued the courſe of the river through
the meadows, and formed the left hand diviſion; the Britiſh line marched
parallel to it at ſome diſtance through the woods, and formed the centre
diviſion; General Fraſer's corps, with the grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and light infantry
of the Germans, were obliged to make a large detour through the woods, and
formed the right hand diviſion or column. Beyond this, on the right, there
were, as I underſtand, flanking parties of light infantry and
Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials?</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">40.</note>Q. Was the country, over which
the army paſſed, interſected with a deep ravine?</p> 
                        <p>A. It was one of the deepeſt I ever ſaw.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">41.</note>Q. Which column was firſt
attacked? </p> 
                        <p>A. The advanced party, conſiſting of the picquets of the
centre column, being ſent <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0652302600:59"/> forwards, under the command of
Major Forbes, to explore the way by which that column was to paſs, fell in
with a conſiderable body of the rebels, poſted in a houſe and behind
fences, which they attacked, and after a great deal of fire, the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
nearly drove in the body of rebels; but on finding that the woods quite round
them were filled with the enemy, they were obliged to retire to the main
body.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">42.</note>Q. Was the march ſo performed
that when General Burgoyne formed the line of the Britiſh infantry, General
Fraſer's corps were ready upon their right to ſupport them?</p> 
                        <p>A. General Fraſer, on hearing the fire of Major Forbes's
party, detached two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies to ſupport them, which came up juſt after
that engagement was over; and on their appearance the enemy finding that our
troops were in ſtrength, quitted the poſt they had before occupied, and,
immediately after this, the whole line was formed with the utmoſt regularity.
I would explain, that when I ſpeak of the line, I do not include the left
hand column which was compoſed of Germans, and which did not come into the
line or into action till late in the day.</p>

                           <note place="margin">46.</note>Q. Was your Lordſhip near the

                           <note place="margin">47.</note>Q. Were not different attempts
made by the General's orders to charge the enemy with bayonets, and did not
thoſe attempts fail by the heavineſs of the enemy's fire and thickneſs of
the woods?</p> 
                        <p>A. There were many attempts made for that purpoſe, and they
all failed except the laſt, when the Britiſh troops finally drove them out
of the field.</p>

                           <note place="margin">48.</note>Q. When part of the German troops
did get into action that day under General Reideſel, how did they behave?</p>

                        <p>A. I heard their behaviour ſpoke of in the higheſt terms;
they marched up to the enemy with great coolneſs and ſteadineſs, and gave
them, as I was told, three vollies by word of command from their officers.</p>

the loſs ſuſtained by the three Britiſh regiments, the 62d in

                        <p>A. The loſs was very conſiderable; but I don't recollect
the numbers.</p>

                           <note place="margin">50.</note>Q. Were thoſe three Britiſh
regiments in a condition to have attacked the enemy the next morning?</p> 
                        <p>A. Their numbers were ſo reduced, that I apprehend they were
not.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">51.</note>Q. From the loſs of killed and
wounded, particularly of officers, would it have been deſirable to have
brought thoſe three regiments into action for the next ten days?</p> 
                        <p>A. In leſs than ten days the ſtate of thoſe regiments
certainly would not have <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0652302600:60"/> been much mended; I therefore
apprehend, that if they were not in a condition to be brought into action the
next morning, their inability would have ſtill continued for thoſe ten
days.</p>

                        <p>A. It certainly would have been ſo.</p>

                           <note place="margin">54.</note>Q. Would not the bridge of boats,

been expoſed before the redoubts, above mentioned, were raiſed?</p> 
                        <p>A. They certainly would, had it not been for thoſe redoubts
and a work called the <hi>Tête du pont,</hi> which was raiſed for the

General Burgoyne mentioning to you in confidence, the receipt of a letter from

                        <p>A. I perfectly recollect the General's mentioning all this to

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">57.</note>Q. Was you near General Burgoyne
in the action of the 7th of October? </p> 
                        <p>A. I was.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">58.</note>Q. Do you recollect what orders
you carried? </p> 
                        <p>A. I do.</p>

                           <note place="margin">59.</note>Q. What were they? </p> 
                        <p>A. The firſt orders I recollect to have carried, were to
poſt fifty men under the command of a captain of the 20th regiment, to the
left of the detachment of the army, in order, in ſome meaſure, to join them
to the advanced works of General Fraſer's camp, and, in caſe of any
accident, to protect the detachment, ſhould they find it neceſſary, to
retire thither.</p> 
                        <p>The next orders I carried were to Major General Phillips, at
the end of the action, acquainting him, that as that detachment ſeemed much
diſordered from the enemy having turned both their flanks, that it was
neceſſary to draw it as ſoon as poſſible back to the camp, which
ſeemed menaced with an attack; the care of this General Burgoyne committed to
General Phillips, while he himſelf returned to the camp, in order to take
proper meaſures for its defence. On our return thither the works of the camp
were actually attacked as General Burgoyne had foreſeen, and I was then
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to collect what troops I ſhould meet, and to order them to thoſe
parts where they were moſt wanted. Soon after this, the enemy having got
round the right of our camp, we expected an attack upon our rear, and I then
was diſpatched with orders from General Burgoyne to Brigadier General
Hamilton, for all the works in <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0652302600:61"/> the rear of the camp, which
had been previouſly conſtructed, to be manned with ſuch ſoldiers as he
could ſpare from the defence of the front.</p>

orders Sir Francis Clarke was charged with, at the time he received his

                        <p>A. I met Sir Francis Clarke as I was ſearching for General
Phillips, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with my orders, telling him at the ſame time,
that as the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the wood might prevent my finding General Phillips
directly, I wiſhed he would aſſiſt me, in order that no time might be
loſt in delivering thoſe orders; that was the laſt time I ſaw Sir
Francis Clarke, and I believe that ſoon afterwards he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the wound of
which he died?</p>

                           <note place="margin">61.</note>Q. Was it dark before General
Burgoyne had a certainty that Col. Breyman was killed, and his poſt carried
by the enemy?</p> 
                        <p>A. It was ſo dark that the officer, who I believe firſt
brought the intelligence of it, ſeeing a number of men round the fires of
that camp, took them for Germans, and was not convinced of his error till he
was fired upon by them, as they proved to be a party of the enemy who had
forced the works.</p>

                           <note place="margin">62.</note>Q. Did General Burgoyne uſe any
efforts to rally the Germans who were returning from the action, and to
perſuade them to recover Colonel Breyman's poſt?</p> 
                        <p>A. He certainly did his utmoſt endeavours for that
purpoſe, which however were ineffectual from the darkneſs of the night, and
the entire confuſion in which they were.</p>

that could have been ſpared for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?</p> 
                        <p>A. There certainly were not; every regiment was occupied in
defence of its own lines which were not certainly overmanned.</p>

                           <note place="margin">64.</note>Q. In the heat of the action do

                           <note place="margin">65.</note>Q. Was not General Reideſel
exerting himſelf to reſtore order in his troops?</p> 
                        <p>A. General Reideſel appeared to me to have behaved, on that

ſtate of things in general at Saratoga?</p> 
                        <p>A. The ſtate of our army was certainly as bad as
poſſible. Their numbers were few, their proviſions ſhort, and their
poſition not a good one, owing to the nature of the country, which roſe to
the diſtance of ſome miles, one hill overtopping that which was next to

                        <p>A. My ſituation in the army not entitling me to be in the

not entruſted with the orders that were given to Col. Baume.</p>

to give Colonel Baume the command of that expedition?</p> 
                        <p>A. I believe there was no officer in that army of ſufficient

                        <p>A. I can't exactly ſpeak to the deſcription of the people
of that country, as I was never there myſelf; but there were employed on that
expedition numbers of provincials, many of whom were of that very country; and
I apprehend that the common ſoldiers of a regular army are not the immediate
people who are expected to ſound the minds of any country to which they are

                        <p>A. The opinions of an army, who cannot be acquainted with the

                        <p>A. They were neceſſary in our particular ſituation,
being within half a mile of the enemy, to whom we were oppoſed, and being
inferior in numbers.</p>

                        <p>A. I don't know what the ſpecies of their fortification was;
but I have been always told that great labour had been employed on their works;
and what ſmall part I ſaw of them convinced me of it.</p>

                        <p>A. It was: there were left at Ticonderoga ſix heavy
twelve-pounders, one light twelve-pounder, four light three-pounders, four
royal mortars and twelve co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns. Left on board the Royal George, two heavy
twenty-four-pounders, two thirteen-inch mortars, two ten-inch mortars, four
eight-inch mortars, four royal mortars and eight cohorns. Sent back to St.
John's in the Radau, fourteen heavy twenty-four-pounders, two eight-inch
howitzers. Left at Fort George, four medium twelve-pounders, two light
ſix-pounders, two eight-inch howitzers, two royal howitzers. With Colonel St.
Leger's expedition to Fort Stanwix were ſent two light ſix-pounders, two
light three-pounders, four cohorns. Left at St. John's, four light
ſix-pounders, five light three-pounders, four cohorn mortars: that was the
diſtribution of artillery that remained after the army had quitted Fort
George. The quantity of artillery brought forward with the army were four
medium twelve-pounders, two light twenty-four-pounders, eighteen light
ſix-pounders, ſix light three-pounders, two eighteen-inch howitzers, four
royal howitzers, two eight-inch mortars, four royal mortars.</p>

tho' conſiſting of ſome twenty-four-pounders and ſome twelve pounders,
properly field artillery?</p> 
                        <p>A. They certainly were, and have ever been conſidered as
ſuch on all field ſervices. Heavy artillery is of a diſtinct nature, and
conſiderably heavier than guns of the ſame calibre which we had in the
army.</p>

ever known a leſs proportion than the brigaded artillery, which was attached
to the line and to the advanced corps, allotted to the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of

                        <p>A. The proportion of field artillery certainly ſhould vary
both in quantity and nature according to the variety of circumſtances under
which the army is to act; the uſual allotment of light field pieces are two
to each battalion; and from a calculation of the number and ſtrength of
General Burgoyne's army, I do not conceive that our light field artillery
exceeded that proportion.</p>

preſent themſelves in that part of the country, and from which it may be
impoſſible to diſlodge them without artillery of a more conſiderable

are particularly uſeful againſt redoubts and other works where the enemy

                        <p>A. The tranſport of our artillery and ſtores were
conſtantly made by horſes <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0652302600:76"/> attached to our department,
and therefore I do not conceive it did in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner interfere with the
tranſport of proviſions—I mean to confine myſelf in this anſwer
to the tranſport from Fort George to the Hudſon's River; for after
croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the river we had ſome oxen and horſes attached to the

forward the park artillery from Fort George to the bridge of boats over the
Hudſon's River?</p> 
                        <p>A. The light brigade and the artillery of the park, with their
proper propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtores and ammunition, had their horſes, carriages,
and drivers conſtantly attached to them; it therefore required no more time
to carry thoſe ſtores than was neceſſary for the carriages themſelves
to paſs from Fort George to the Hudſon's River; but with reſpect to the
reſerve which was afterwards tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by water in bateaux, I believe
two days with all our carriages would eaſily have conveyed them to the

action did you obſerve before you was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, particularly reſpecting the
artillery and the enemy's advancing under the fire of the artillery, and what
happened to the troops poſted immediately on the left of the artillery?</p> 
                        <p>A. The ground on which the artillery was poſted was a clear
ſpot, in a great meaſure ſurrounded by woods, the ſkirts of which on
our left was diſtant about two hundred yards where the attack firſt began.
The two medium twelve-pounders were poſted on a ſmall eminence, nearly in
the center of this cleared ſpot between the German picquets and a detachment
of the Heſſe Hanau regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. On the enemy's column approaching, the fire
of the twelve-pounders and the four ſixes was immediately directed towards
the enemy's column, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, they drew up along the ſkirts
of the wood behind trees, and after driving in the Germans, kept a pretty warm
fire of muſketry on the guns and the troops poſted about them; ſoon after
this I heard a firing on the right <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0652302600:77"/> towards a cleared
ſpot, ſeparated from us by a wood on which the light infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were
poſted on very commanding ground. On their retreating, as alſo the
twenty-fourth regiment who was drawn up in the wood on our right, the enemy
made their appearance on an eminence on our right, and cut off the retreat of
the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery—At this moment I received my wound, and therefore can give
no farther account of the circumſtances of that day's action.</p>

                        <p>A. The whole number of horſes detached with the Britiſh
artillery, previous to the paſſing the Hudſon's River, was about four
hundred.</p>

                           <note place="margin">27.</note>Q. How many would have been
neceſſary for the field pieces attached to the battalions only?</p> 
                        <p>A. Eighteen ſix-pounders at four horſes each; ſix
three-pounders at three horſes each, and two royal howitzers at three
horſes each: the remainder were for park artillery, ammunition, and ſtores
of all kinds to accommodate the army on its march.</p>

                           <note place="margin">28.</note>Q. Was the forage for theſe
horſes procured in the country on their march, or brought from a
diſtance?</p> 
                        <p>A. A quantity of oats was brought forward from Canada, but
with reſpect to other forage they were under the neceſſity of collecting
it in the neighbourhood of the encampment.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">29.</note>Q. How many waggons might the
bringing on that quantity of oats employ?</p> 
                        <p>A. I believe the quantity of oats after paſſing Fort
Edward was ſo trifling that I don't believe it loaded one waggon.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">30.</note>Q. After the army arrived at Fort
Edward, did any delay or not ariſe to its forward progreſs from bringing on
the park artillery, waiting for horſes and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers for that purpoſe, or to
provide forage?</p> 
                        <p>A. The park artillery remained at Fort Edward no longer than
was neceſſary during the time the army remained in that neighbourhood: I do
not know of any delay whatever from the want of horſes and drivers. Had the
park artillery moved forwards ſooner, no end could have been anſwered by
it, before the bridge was thrown over the Hudſon's River.</p>

                           <note place="margin">32.</note>Q. Were there a ſufficient

                        <p>A. It appeared that the naval force was ſuperior to that of
the rebels, from the event of that engagement; and therefore I conclude, that
for the uſes of that cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign there were a ſufficient number.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">33.</note>Q. Did you apprehend, before the

                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0652302600:78"/>A. We had received very exaggerated
accounts of the rebel force on the lakes, and therefore uncommon exertions were
uſed to render our force as formidable as poſſible; and probably ſome
time was loſt, and the campaign in ſome degree retarded, from that

Colonel Chriſtie engaged about two hundred. I know of no others being ſent

                           <note place="margin">37.</note>Q. Whether the number of
artificers ſent out for that campaign were, in any degree, ſufficient for
the purpoſe of carrying it on?</p> 
                        <p>A. Certainly not. We were under the neceſſity of
collecting all the artificers that could be met with in Canada for the armament
of St. John's only, moſt of the bateaux being built by private contract.</p> 
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">38.</note>Q. Were not the operations of
that campaign conſiderably retarded, for want of the number of artificers
that were aſked for and not granted?</p> 
                        <p>A. Had the number of artificers been greater, there can be no

be a ſtate of the number of horſes actually attached to the ſeveral

the army took the field, relative to the baggage of officers, has not been
complied with; and that the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in general are encumbered with much more
baggage than they can poſſibly be ſupplied with means of conveying, when

officers, to convey by the bateaux, which will ſoon return to Ticonderoga,
the baggage that is not indiſpenſibly neceſſary to them; or upon the
firſt ſudden movement, it muſt inevitably be left upon the ground. Such
gentlemen as ſerved in America the laſt war may remember that the officers

knapſack for months together.</p>

                     <p>A. He deſired me to leave it with him till the afternoon for
his conſideration. He came himſelf to my tent the next morning early; he
expreſſed himſelf to me in a manner that conveyed a diſapprobation of
the Germans being employed in it. I think I obſerved to him that ſince the
honour gained by the advanced corps at Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton, I believed General Reideſel
was deſirous of having the Germans employed. I mentioned to General Fraſer
my ideas of proviſions being obtained by that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the army
thereby enabled to get quicker on to Albany than waiting for the ſlow
tranſport from Fort George. General Fraſer ſaid ſomething about
Germans, which I don't recollect; which brought this remark from me. I
deſired General Fraſer, from the friendſhip he had for General Burgoyne,
if he ſaw any real objection to this plan, to expreſs himſelf fully and
freely to General Burgoyne himſelf; that the ſcouts of the army and the
guides were attached to his the advanced corps, and he might, through them,
perhaps know more of the nature of the country than I did; and therefore I
preſſed him to mention his objections, if he had any, to General Burgoyne.
I think he ſaid, but am not quite certain, 
<q rend="inline">"the Germans are not a very active people; but
it may do."</q> I preſſed him at parting to go to General Burgoyne, if he
thought it would not do. He ſaid No, and went off.</p>

at different times at Fort George to forward the proviſions, and I believe
ſubſequent to the ill news from Bennington. The quarter-maſter-general (I

a great many other officers were killed and wounded, and the regiment
ſuffered greatly.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">67.</note>Q. To what degree did the men of
the artillery ſuffer in that action? </p> 
                     <p>A. I think, but am not quite certain, that the number that were
with four guns amounted to forty-eight. I ſaw Captain Jones, who was a very
gallant man, and commanded thoſe four guns, killed, and ſome other officers
wounded, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve about thirty ſix of the men were killed and wounded.
I ſhould in juſtice to the artillery ſay, that I think it is not in the
power of men to keep a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fire, both of round and grape-ſhot, than was
ſucceſſively maintained for ſeveral hours that day.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">68.</note>Q. From your experience in the
ſervice, do you conceive it would have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to any officer, to engage
troops, if he could poſſibly avoid it, in the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which the
Britiſh line was the day after that action?</p> 
                     <p>A. The experience of an officer of my inferior rank does not
lead to much; but I ſhould have been ſorry to have given orders to thoſe
regiments, after the gallant ſufferings of that day, to have attacked an army
reported, both from our ſpies and our priſoners, to be very near if not
more than four times the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our whole force: add to this, the country
was a very thick wood, and <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0652302600:87"/> the ſituation of the rebel
camp, I believe, could not by any means be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitred within that ſpace of
time.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">69.</note> Q</p> 
                     <p>Do you remember General Burgoyne receiving a letter from Sir
Henry Clinton the day but one after that action, informing him, that he
intended about that time an attack on Fort Montgomery?</p> 
                     <p>A. I do remember his receiving a letter from Sir Henry Clinton
about that time; it was the 22d of September.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">70.</note>Q. Do you imagine that any officer
knowing of that letter would have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thoughts of immediately renewing
an attack upon the enemy?</p> 
                     <p>A. As far as an opinion of an officer of my inferior rank goes,
I ſhould not have thought of it, nor did I hear any officer of any rank
expreſs ſuch an idea at that time.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">71.</note>Q. From what you knew of the
country, did you not believe that a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful attack from Sir Henry
Clinton during the time we lay at that camp, would either have diſlodged
General Gates entirely, or have obliged him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach conſiderably from his
army?</p> 
                     <p>A. I remember our ſcouts giving information, that a bridge was
laid over the Hudſon's River, very near the enemy's camp; and it was the
opinion of ſome very confidential men that were employed in that army in that
capacity, and were much under the direction of General Fraſer, that on the
approach of Sir Henry Clinton's army, the army of Mr. Gates could not ſtand
us, but would croſs the river, and go towards New England. Whether the idea
was right or wrong, I can't tell.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">72.</note>Q. Did you ever hear ſuch
perſons, or any others, expreſs an idea, that the enemy would have taken
the ſame meaſure on our advancing to attack them without that
co-operation?</p> 
                     <p>A. I don't remember to have heard any ſuch thing.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">73.</note>Q. Do you imagine that any officer
knowing of Sir Henry Clinton's letters, would have thought it proper to retreat
after the action of the 19th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember?</p> 
                     <p>A. I never heard any officer expreſs an idea of that ſort. I
don't know what officers might be within the knowledge of ſuch a letter; but
I lived intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with General Phillips, General Fraſer, and with Mr.
Twiſs, the engineer; whether the letter was in their knowledge or not, I
don't know: but I never heard them expreſs ſuch an idea.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">74.</note>Q. Did you ever hear any officer of
that army, though unacquainted with the letter, before or ſince the time,
expreſs a diſapprobation of the meaſure of remaining in that camp without
either attacking or retreating?</p> 
                     <p>A. Neither then or at any time while I remained in America, and
of courſe not ſince.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">75.</note>Q. From your converſation with
the chief engineer, and from other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, have you reaſon to know,
that every poſſible means were uſed after the action of the 19th, to
obtain a knowledge of the ground on the enemy's left?</p> 
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0652302600:88"/>A. I had frequent converſations with the
chief engineer on that ſubject. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his attention was given to that
point almoſt every day, and a knowledge of that ground I underſtood to be
very difficult to be obtained.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">76.</note>Q. Was not the right of the enemy
deemed impracticable. </p> 
                     <p>A. I had no opportunity myſelf of ſeeing the right of the
enemy; but I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood from others, that the poſition was too ſtrong to
be attacked with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſucceſs.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">77.</note>Q. Were there not frequent
conſultations held between General Burgoyne, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Phillips and General
Fraſer, previous to the movement up to the enemy on the 7th of October?</p> 
                     <p>A. I underſtood there was ſcarce a day paſſed without
ſuch conſultation; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no day after the action of the 19th.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">78.</note>Q. Did you conceive that the chief
purpoſe of that movement was to attain a knowledge of the left of the enemy's
poſition, and if expedient to attack them there?</p> 
                     <p>A. I underſtood it was.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">79.</note>Q. Did it appear to you, that the
force left in camp, under General Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, was more than ſufficient to keep
the enemy in check?</p> 
                     <p>A. I don't think it was.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">80.</note>Q. From the intimacy and confidence
in which you lived with General Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne and General Fraſer, do you imagine
any diſagreement of opinion could have ſubſiſted between them without
your knowledge?</p> 
                     <p>A. I think I muſt have heard of it.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">81.</note>Q. Do you know any inſtance, but
more eſpecially reſpecting the periods of paſſing the Hudſon's River,
the action of the 19th of September, and that of the 7th of October, wherein
General Fraſer expreſſed a diſapprobation of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Burgoyne's
meaſures?</p> 
                     <p>A. I do not: but I would beg leave to obſerve, that upon the
plan to Bennington, General Fraſer had expreſſed a different opinion,
with reſpect to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the Germans. At the time of paſſing the
Hudſon's River, and after it was croſſed, I had a great deal of
converſation with General Fraſer: he ſeemed to expreſs ſatisfaction
in the manner in which the troops had paſſed.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">82.</note>Q. In the action of the 7th of
October, after the German troops on the left of the artillery had given way,
did you obſerve General Phillips and General Reideſel in perſon?</p> 
                     <p>A. I was with General Phillips at different times, and I ſaw
General Reide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel more than once; they were both very active, and exerted
themſelves very much to form the broken troops, and to make the retreat as
regular as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would permit.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">83.</note>Q. What was the laſt time you
ſaw Sir Francis Clarke in that action, and do you know what orders he was
carrying?</p> 
                     <p>A. It was after the retreat was become very general. Sir Francis
Clarke aſked me, if I had given any orders to the artillery to retreat? I
told him, that as there was a major-general of the artillery in the field, who
was confeſſed by the army to be a very excellent officer, I would not take
on myſelf, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutant-general, <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0652302600:89"/> to give orders to any
part of the artillery. Sir Francis Clarke told me, that a diſpoſition had
been made for a general retreat, and that he was going with orders from General
Burgoyne to bring off the artillery. About the inſtant we were parting, a
very heavy fire came upon us from the enemy, and I have ſince had reaſon to
believe, that Sir Francis Clarke received his wound at that time.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">84.</note>Q. On the day of the 8th, do you
remember the enemy forming a line in the meadows, and making a demonſtration
of attacking us?</p> 
                     <p>A. I do remember it very well, and that there was a great deal
of cannonading from the enemy.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">85.</note>Q. Do you remember alſo a
cannonading in the afternoon, about the time of General Fraſer's funeral?</p>

                     <p>A. I think I ſhall never forget that circumſtance. General
Fraſer, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood had deſired to be buried privately, in one of the
redoubts that had been raiſed for the protection of our magazines and
ſtores; as the corpſe was paſſing by, General Burgoyne, General
Phillips, and I believe General Reideſel, and ſeveral other officers, out
of reſpect to General Fraſer's memory, and to do him honour in the eyes of
the army, notwithſtanding his requeſt, attended his fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral into the
redoubt. The enemy were in this inſtance, I thought, very defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in point
of humanity; they pointed a gun or two at that very redoubt, and kept up a
briſk cannonade during the whole of the funeral ſervice, which was
performed with great ſolemnity and very deliberately by Mr. Brudenel, the
chaplain. I never ſaw ſo affecting a ſight.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">86.</note>Q. Do you remember on the march to
Saratoga ſeeing a corps of the enemy at work on the plain of Saratoga?</p> 
                     <p>A. I do very well; a working party, and what appeared to be a
battalion or more drawn up as a covering party.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">87.</note>Q. Was that the corps that
afterwards took poſt on the oppoſite ſide of the river?</p> 
                     <p>A. I believe it was the ſame corps I ſaw afterwards
paſſing the ford.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">88.</note>Q. After the arrival of the army at
Saratoga, was Lieutenant Colonel Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land detached with a command to cover a
party of workmen to repair bridges and roads, in order to continue the retreat
on the weſt ſide of the river?</p> 
                     <p>A. He was ordered with a party to repair bridges and roads on
the weſt ſide.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">89.</note>Q. Do you remember on what account
Colonel Sutherland and the party were recalled?</p> 
                     <p>A. I believe it was on information given by our ſcouts, that
the enemy were preparing to attack us in great force.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">90.</note>Q. Have you further reaſon to
know that a geneaal attack on that day was really intended by the enemy?</p> 
                     <p>A. There was particular caution ſent round to all the troops
to be prepared for that attack, as it was expected it would be attempted under
cover of a very thick fog then prevailing. After the convention had taken
place, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral officer in the rebel ſervice acquainted me, that ſuch an
attack was intended, <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0652302600:90"/> and from information, I believe from
deſerters, or from their own ſcouts, that our army was exceedingly well
prepared to receive them, that they would be very much expoſed when they came
on the plain to our artillery, he not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated with his command, but
ſent word to another general officer to retreat alſo. The other general
officer was his ſenior; but he had taken that upon him, from the fear of the
conſequences of ſuch an attack, of which he ſent word to General Gates,
who approved and confirmed his order.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">91.</note>Q. Previous to the council of war
to which the field officers were called, do you remember it being determined in
the council of the generals, to try a night march, abandoning the carriages and
baggage, and orders being given for the delivery of as much proviſions as the
men could carry?</p> 
                     <p>A. I do remember ſuch a determination very well.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">92.</note>Q. What prevented the execution of
it? </p> 
                     <p>A. I underſtood there were ſuch difficulties in getting out
the proviſions, that the delivery of the neceſſary proviſions could not
be accompliſhed.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">93.</note>Q. Had we intelligence the next day
from different ſcouts, that the enemy was in poſſeſſion of the
country in force, on both ſides the Hudſon's River, between us and Fort

                     <p>A. I underſtood, from ſome of the ſcouts that we had been

                        <note place="margin">94.</note>Q. Have you reaſon to know that
the intelligence General Burgoyne ſtated to the council of war on this

                     <p>A. I was aſſured by one of the general officers who
conducted us towards Boſton that troops of theirs were in the poſition that

other ſide of the Hudſon's River, included in Mr. Gates's return, and
therefore I imagine the men under his command are included alſo. When I ſay
one, I do not mean to have underſtood that the other two general officers,
the one who was ſtationed with a party oppoſite to Saratoga, and the one
who was ſtationed on the ſame ſide of the water, between us and Fort
Edward, are not alſo included in General Gates's return.</p>

reſpecting the military cheſt, while the treaty of Saratoga was
depending?</p> 
                     <p>A. I do remember that it was ſtrongly recommended to the commanding
officers of corps to take ſums of money from the paymaſter general, on
account of ſubſiſtence then due to their regiments; and I believe a great
deal of money was ſo diſtributed, and regularly accounted for to the
paymaſter general on the ſubſequent ſettlement of the pay of the
army.</p>

                     <p>A. If any ſuch thing had happened, I think the paymaſter general
would have applied to me immediately. Never having heard, then or at any time
after, of any loſs having been ſuſtained, I do not believe there was any
loſs ſuffered in the retreat or after it.</p>

expences?</p>

themſelves, and in acts of charity to women who had loſt their huſbands,
and other occaſions which it was very proper for a general officer to give,
and very proper to put into a public account.</p>

ſituation, all the expences attending a Commander in Chief?</p> 
                     <p>A. He certainly had, from being obliged to keep a public table for the
entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and refreſhment of officers and others coming to head
quarters, on duty or buſineſs; and I know thoſe expences to have been
very great, from the exceeding high price of all the articles of life in that

                     <p>A. There was ſuch a board, and the payments were regulated according
to the report of that board.</p>

                     <p>A. I really believe his appointments were not equal to his expences in
that campaign.</p>

                        <note place="margin">117.</note>Q. What were the numbers of the effective

                     <p>A. I have not thoſe returns; but they were ſent to the Commander in
Chief, and my extracts are for the rank and file.</p>

                        <note place="margin">118.</note>Q. Can you anſwer that queſtion with

Provincials in the army at any time in the campaign?</p> 
                     <p>A. I believe the only queſtion that has been aſked reſpecting them
was at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the campaign; they were then eighty-three. On the
firſt of September they amounted to about ſix hundred and eighty, which was
the greateſt number they ever amounted to.</p>

                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0652302600:94"/>A. I underſtand them to be inhabitants of that

                     <p>A. I believe, in the former part of my evidence, the Canadians were
ſtated to be one hundred and forty-eight, and diſtinguiſhed from the
Provincials.</p>

of the twelfth of July, relating to the baggage, ſtrictly complied with?</p>

enforce an obſervance and obedience to the general orders.</p>

                        <note place="margin">123.</note>Q. Was it actually enforced in ſuch a

                     </p> 
                     <p>A. I never had any report made to me by a commanding officer of any
corps, of that order not being complied with.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">125.</note>Q. What was your own ocular obſervation
of the quantity of baggage carried with the army; and did it appear to you that
that order could have been fairly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with?</p> 
                     <p>A. I own I don't recollect, not hearing any complaint nor attending to
it. The quarter maſter general of the army muſt naturally know more of the
baggage than the adjutant general.</p>

                        <note place="margin">127.</note>Q. Was none of the baggage brought down in
wheeled carriages? </p> 
                     <p>A. Several officers, I believe, bought waggons and carts of the country
people for their own uſe; but I do not remember any of the king's carts or
waggons being appropriated to the carriage of officers' baggage. It might be,
but I don't recollect it.</p>

many horſes might be employed in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the baggage of the army, including

                     <p>A. I never had any information upon that ſubject; it did not belong to
my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and I had much buſineſs on my hands.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">129.</note>Q. How was the regimental baggage
carried?</p> 
                     <p>A. I believe chiefly in bateaux.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">130.</note>Q. How was it carried when there was no
water-carriage? </p> 
                     <p>A. I can't ſpeak to that point, having had no information on that
ſubject; and when I ſpeak of bateaux, I ſpeak generally, having
<hi>had</hi> no information on the ſubject.</p>

                        <note place="margin">131.</note>Q. Can you ſay, in a general way, how
many women attended the army?</p> 
                     <p>A. I had really ſo much to do that I had not much leiſure to pay
much attention to the ladies; and I know very little of their beauty or their
numbers.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">132.</note>Q. Would not the feeding of two thouſand
women be a conſiderable object with reſpect to the proviſions of the

                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0652302600:95"/>A. I ſhould have been very ſorry to have had two

                        <note place="margin">133.</note>Q. How many women were there, if not two
thouſand?</p> 
                     <p>A. I would wiſh to give the houſe every information in my power, whe
n ca n ſpeak with any degree of accuracy or tolerable gueſs. I have ſeen
the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of proviſions return, and I think the number of women
returned, as victualled from the ſtores, were very very few.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">134.</note>Q. Do you think that a corps of dragoons
mounted would have been of great uſe to the army?</p> 
                     <p>A. I own, I very much wiſhed thoſe few dragoons we had could have
been mounted, becauſe, though in that part of America that I ſaw they might
not have been neceſſary or uſeful to have made a charge, I think thoſe
light dragoons might be always applied to very uſeful ſervices.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">135.</note>Q. How many had you of thoſe
dragoons?</p> 
                     <p>A. They are included in the ſtrength of the Germans, and I really do
not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their particular number.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">136.</note>Q. If none or leſs of the park of
artillery had been brought forward, would there not have been horſes to have
mounted thoſe dragoons?</p> 
                     <p>A. I believe there might have been horſes enough taken from the
artillery, or from the proviſion train, to have mounted thoſe dragoons, if
it had been thought more expedient to have employed the horſes in that
manner; but they were hired or contracted for, for the ſpecial purpoſes of
carrying proviſions, and bringing on the artillery, and never meant by the
perſons who furniſhed the contract for the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon ſervice.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">137.</note>Q. If a ſmaller quantity of baggage had
been carried, might not the officers have ſpared ſome of their baggage
horſes for mounting the dragoons?</p> 
                     <p>A. I never met with an officer who had horſes to ſpare. I know Sir
Francis Clarke and myſelf wiſhed to buy horſes to carry our own
ſervants; cared very little what expence we were at, and yet I could not
obtain any.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">138.</note>Q. Do you know of any corps or party
finding their way back to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada?</p> 
                     <p>A. I never heard of any corps finding its way there; and I underſtood
from the guides who were with us, previous to the convention's taking place,
that if that was attempted, we muſt break into ſmall parties, and go by
what is called Indian paths.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">139.</note>Q. Suppoſing there was a ſmall party
that found its way to Canada by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian paths, do you think it would have been
poſſible for an army to have done the ſame?</p> 
                     <p>A. My idea of that muſt be founded upon the report of thoſe guides
who had ſerved us very faithfully as ſcouts upon former occaſions, and
who inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that we muſt break into very ſmall parties, to have any
chance of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our way through the woods to Canada; and I remember that when
General Phillips offered to attempt to find his way to Ticonderoga, it was
talked of and looked on to be as deſperate as gallant.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">140.</note>Q. If any party did make its way to
Canada, do you not ſuppoſe it muſt <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0652302600:96"/> be that party of
provincials that ran away while they were employed to repair roads, and that
were never heard of afterwards?</p> 
                     <p>A. I remember ſome were reported to have run away who were making
roads, and it is likely to have been that party.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">141.</note>Q. When you mentioned the higheſt number
of provincials, did you mean that they were all armed?</p> 
                     <p>A. I know that they were not all armed. We had not arms for them.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">142.</note>Q. Of thoſe that were armed, ſome
reſpectable perſons excepted, were they much to be depended upon?</p> 
                     <p>A. A very great part of them were ſuch as I ſhould have placed very

not a ſtrict order, that not more than three women a company ſhould be
ſuffered to embark?</p> 
                     <p>A. I do know there was ſuch an order iſſued, and I never heard any
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of its having been broke through. I don't recollect the date of that
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or I would have turned to my book, and ſtated to the houſe, upon
the firſt queſtion relative to the number of women that were employed on
our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>

                        <note place="margin">144.</note>Q. Is it not the cuſtom in all armies
victualled from the king's ſtores, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the delivery of proviſions
to any women over and above the number allowed by order?</p> 
                     <p>A. It was cuſtomary in all places where I ſerved in the laſt war,
and very ſtrong and peremptory orders were given on that ſubject to the
commiſſaries in our army.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">145.</note>Q. Do you not then believe, that all women
who followed your army were fed from the ration of the men they followed, or
found their proviſion in the country?</p> 
                     <p>A. I remember, upon aſking the commiſſaries how there came to be
ſo few women in the provincial returns, I was told, it was the cuſtom for
them to be ſupplied out of the men's rations.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">146.</note>Q. Were the women conveyed on baggage
carts or horſes, or did they walk a-foot?</p> 
                     <p>A. I never heard of the women's being conveyed on baggage carts or the
king's horſes.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">147.</note>Q. If the women neither employed the

of impediment, or of comfort to the king's troops?</p> 
                     <p>A. I never underſtood from my converſation with the commanding
officers, or others, that the women were any impediment.</p>

there was any doubt in the army in which you ſerved, of their being able to

                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0652302600:97"/>A. I always underſtood that the army had been very

                        <note place="margin">150.</note>Q. Do you believe, if the ſecretary of
ſtate had ordered the army under Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe to co-operate with the army
under General Burgoyne for the North River, with a view to have formed the
junction of the two armies, that the diſaſter which befel General
Burgoyne's army could have happened?</p> 
                     <p>A. If a junction could have been formed, I ſhould apprehend that Mr.
Gates's army might have been diſlodged, and that the misfortune at Saratoga
would not have happened. This is only matter of opinion.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">151.</note>Q. Do you apprehend, that if the army
under Sir William Howe had ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated on the North River, with a view to effect
a junction, that ſuch a junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have taken place?</p> 
                     <p>A. I had an opinion while in America, that if the expedition which came
up the Hudſon's River under General Vaughan, could have have been there about
the time of our action of the 19th of September, that Mr. Gates would have
found it difficult to have kept his army together, if he had not croſſed
over the Hudſon's River towards New England. But this is mere matter of
private opinion.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">152.</note>Q. If you are of opinion, that the troops
under General Vaughan would have had ſo powerful an effect, even ſo late as
September, what effect do you think Sir William Howe's army, aſſiſted by
all the fleet and craft, would have had as early as the beginning of July,
immediately after the impreſſion which took place among the enemy after the
defeat at Ticonderoga?</p> 
                     <p>A. I did not know what force there was under the command of General
Vaughan, nor do I even now know; but I ſhould think moſt certainly, that a
great army upon the Hudſon's River near Albany, would have contributed very
much to our making our way to Albany.</p>

what do you impute it?</p> 
                     <p>A. I looked upon our force not to be equal to the forcing our way to
Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany without ſome co-operation.</p>

                        <note place="margin">154.</note>Q. Where then did you expect that
co-operation?</p> 
                     <p>A. I had no where to expect it from, but up the Hudſon's River from
New York; and the ſucceſs of Colonel St. Leger's expedition would have been
of uſe certainly.</p>

army up the Hudſon's River.</p> 
                     <p>A. I don't know the ſtrength of General Waſhington's army, nor the

when the king's troops marched by with the accoutrements on, Mr Gates aſked
me (we had been old acquaintance formerly) whether it was not cuſtomary on

            <head>Review of the Evidence; its ſeveral Parts compared with the
prefatory Speech and Narrative; and additional Remarks and Explanations.</head>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The conduct of Lord G. Germain, during the
enquiry.</note>THE noble Lord who is at iſſue with me upon this occaſion
has, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, deprived me of the benefit of a reply, properly
ſo called, becauſe he has produced no defence. His Lordſhip certainly has
been accuſed by me in many inſtances of a very ſerious nature. If he is
really willing that his political, and my military conduct ſhould be tried by
facts alone, I certainly have not ſhewn leſs incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation than his
Lordſhip for that teſt; but, taxed as I avow he has been by me, with
proceedings derogatory to the obligations which ought to ſubſiſt between
man and man, I really expected, as I believe did the Houſe of Commons and the
public, to have heard from him ſome juſtification in thoſe reſpects.
Inſtead of that, the noble Lord, in opening the ſubjects to which he
propoſed to call evidence, touched ſo ſlightly upon the branch of the
enquiry in which we are parties, that a ſtranger would hardly have thought
there ſubſiſted a diſpute between us. His Lordſhip contradicted
nothing that I have alledged reſpecting his conduct or my own; he ſtated no
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of blame againſt me, except he meant as ſuch the enterprize
of Bennington, which he qualified with the epithet "fatal," and pronounced to
be the cauſe of all the ſubſequent misfortunes. He paſſed entirely
over the tranſactions at Saratoga. Of forty officers or more, belonging to
the Convention troops, then in England, one only was propoſed to be called on
his Lordſhip's part, <hi>viz.</hi> Lieutenant Colonel Sutherland, of the 47th
regiment, upon parole from the Congreſs, and acting with a corps of the
Fencible Men in North Britain; but, upon further reflection, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
thought proper to diſpenſe with the attendance of this officer; and the
only witneſs under order of the Houſe was Mr. Skene. No man was better
qualified to give an account of the proceedings at Bennington; and I heartily
lament that the public is deprived of his teſtimony.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Claim of G. Burgoyne to cloſe the
cauſe.</note>But although I am thus left in poſſeſſion of the
evidence, uncontroverted by the noble Lord, I avail myſelf of my right of
cloſing the cauſe, for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>following purpoſes: 
<note place="margin">Mode of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</note>firſt, to collect from
the minutes (which, in an enquiry of this nature, are unavoidably prolix and
diſarranged) the ſcattered parts, and apply them to facts, under diſtinct
and ſeparate heads. Next, to examine whether the facts (which, from the
ſilence of the noble Lord, I am to aſſume as admitted by him) are in any
reſpect invalidated by the croſs examination of the witneſſes by other
gentlemen. And <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0652302600:100"/> laſtly, to explain ſuch
circumſtances, and anſwer ſuch new and collateral objections, as have
been pointed at in the ſame croſs examination, and were omitted, or only
ſlightly noticed in my opening, becauſe they did not exiſt, or were not
deemed poſſible objects of blame or cavil. In purſuing theſe
purpoſes, I ſhall conſider the proofs preciſely in the order of the
facts to which they are produced.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Inſinuation of having acted unfair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Sir Guy
Carleton, overthrown by his own evidence.</note>Though the firſt
circumſtance I took notice of in my opening, <hi>viz.</hi> my conduct
reſpecting Sir Guy Carleton, was rather an inſinuation than an allegation
againſt me, I thought it right that it ſhould be the firſt overthrown by
evidence; for while it remained in any degree of force, it gave a general
tinge, as it was meant to do, to my whole cauſe. I could not but expect even
the virtuous prejudices of the human heart to be againſt me, whilſt it was
poſſible to be conceived that in abſence of the commander in chief, to
whom I had acted ſecond; whoſe attention I had conſtantly experienced;
and with whoſe confidence I was then honoured; I had practiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly and
adulatory intrigue to ſuperſede him in a favourite object of
command.—There are few worſe modes of betraying a ſuperior officer to
be found upon the records of diſhonour; and whoever reflects upon the degree
of odium with which the moſt palliated acts of that ſpecies have been
received by mankind, will not wonder at or condemn my impatience, in applying
my firſt queſtions to Sir Guy Carleton to that particular object. 
<note place="margin">See Sir Guy Carleton's evidence, qu. 1, 2,
3.</note>Clear as my juſtification ſtood by the letter formerly referred
to, (No. II.) I ſhall be forgiven for obtaining, though with ſome
redundancy, a full and ſatisfactory confirmation of my innocence, from the
verbal teſtimony of the party whom I was ſuppoſed to have injured.</p>
            <p>It may be proper here to obſerve, that the abovementioned
aſperſion, to which I have ſo often adverted, and at which I have
ſtrove in vain for due terms to expreſs my indignation, was not the only
one caſt upon me reſpecting Sir Guy Carleton. When impartial and candid men
revolted at the inſinuation of my treachery, 
<note place="margin">Aſperſion from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, No. III.</note>my
preſumption and inſolence (a leſſer but ſtill a calumnious charge)
was pointed out in that part of the paper (No. III.) that treats of the force
to be left in Canada, and the diſpoſition of it. I am pleaſed with the
queſtions in the croſs examination of Sir Guy Carleton, marking the
preſcribed diſtribution of the troops, &amp;c. (38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43.)
becauſe that enquiry affords me an opportunity of juſtifying myſelf in a
point which I have not taken notice of before. 
<note place="margin">refuted.</note>The poſts, and the troops which I
imagined would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to occupy them, were ſpecified merely to
ſhew that the number of 3000 was indiſpenſibly requiſite for the
defence of the province. The whole of that detail con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with General
Carleton's requiſitions for reinforcement, and with my reaſoning upon
thoſe requiſitions; and when I aſſert, as I now do, that I never
preſumed to ſuggeſt the neceſſity or propriety of forming a detail of
poſts, (thus given for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0652302600:101"/> into preciſe
orders for the general upon the ſpot, I am ſure the ſecretary of ſtate
will no more contradict that aſſertion than he has done any other I have
made.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">No. III.</note>When in the ſame paper I
confidentially communicated my reaſons for preferring certain corps to
others, I was actuated by the ſame principle of offering every opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that
could conduce to make the intended ſervice effectual. 
<note place="margin">Apology for ſpecifying corps.</note>I thought it a
juſt claim in an arduous undertaking, to have my own choice of the troops;
and I am perſuaded Sir Guy Carleton never took ill of me, either that claim,
or a ſubſequent one in the ſame paper, of being held free from any
imputation of delay, till I ſhould be clear of the province of Quebec. With
an unfeigned confidence in Sir Guy Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, I thought it a precaution fully
juſtifiable, to ſecure myſelf againſt others, in the numerous and
complicated departments under him, who might be found leſs equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than he
is.</p>
            <p>I know I have before complained of the production of theſe ſecret
communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but after ſo many precedents as the laſt Seſſion
furniſhed, of withholding parts of correſpondences from Parliament, upon
the plea that they might affect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, the noble Lord's ſilence upon
thoſe complaints, gives me a right ſtill to comment upon the ſiniſter
purpoſes that are to be aſcribed to the production of that paper at length,
rather than by extract. Thoſe purpoſes were various; but it muſt be
confeſſed one, and only one, good effect may reſult from a review of
them, viz. It may ſerve as a ſalutary caution to any officer, who ſhall
for the future be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into conſultation with the ſame miniſter, how
he commits himſelf by an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of men and things.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Remarkable circumſtance reſpecting the
conſtruction to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my orders.</note>The next point that I entered
upon previouſly to my narrative, was the tenor of my orders, and I believe it
was generally expected that the noble Lord would have taken ſome notice of
the fact I alledged, <hi>that every diſcretionary latitude which I had
propoſed was eraſed, while the plan was in his hand.</hi> As his Lordſhip
had ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon the nature of peremptory orders, as a
<hi>general</hi> queſtion, in my abſence, it would have been fair in him to
have reaſoned upon them after that important and deciſive circumſtance
was laid open.</p>

the army at its outſet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by reaſoning upon the apparent
principles of the campaign, without partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the letter of the orders
is clear, from the general tenor of the evidence. I wiſhed, it is true, to
have heard more copiouſly the ſentiments of Sir Guy Carleton, becauſe he
had full participation of the orders. From the temper and judgment that always
direct his conduct, he declined giving an opinion at the bar upon what might
become a queſtion in the Houſe. But I have ſince (upon requeſt)
received his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to publiſh a letter from him to me, dated ſoon
after the Convention of Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toga, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0652302600:102"/> which is in the

               <p>Moſt of the circumſtances ſtated in my Narrative reſpecting
the firſt period of the campaign, were, from their nature, to be

opinions been merely ſpeculative, the intelligence of the perſons from whom

are verified by facts; for it appears from a multitude of evidence, that the
enemy made the true uſe of local advantages: they fortified every paſs or
proper poſt: the nature of the country, and the neceſſity of keeping the
banks of rivers, made it impoſſible to turn thoſe poſts: had I wanted
therefore artillery, I could not have proceeded any given ten miles, but at a
heavy expence of my beſt troops. When it was found that I was provided with
that forcible arm, the enemy invariably quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their entrenchments, either to
retreat, or fight upon ground where they ſuppoſed artillery could be

intentions might have been, who by his croſs examination placed the

croſs examination of Lord Balcarras it muſt be ſuppoſed, that the

preciſely that which the main body of the army took under me in perſon, and
with ſuch effect, as to come up with the rear of the enemy and drive them
from their fortified poſt at Skeneſborough, with the loſs on their part
of five armed veſſels and all the reſt of their water-craft.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, this part of the croſs-examination, though
incomprehenſible in point of geography, ſtill applied to the queſtion
taken notice of in my narrative, viz. 
<q rend="inline">"Whether it would not have been more expedient to

ſhall not recapitulate the various motives I have before ſtated in
ſupport of that preference, having publickly in my favour the opinion of an
officer ſo enlightened in military ſcience, and ſo well acquainted with
the country as Sir Guy Carleton;<note n="*" place="bottom">See alſo the map of
country.</note> and never having heard a difference of opinion in any other
officer of a like deſcription, to reſt much more upon a ſubject ſo

ſhall only add two ſhort remarks; the one, that the fact of gaining
conſiderable time by allotting the whole ſervice of the water-craft to the
tranſport of proviſion and ſtores over Lake George, inſtead of
employing great part of it for the tranſport of the troops is inconteſtably
proved by the evidence of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Money and Lieutenant Colonel Kingſton: the
other, that to have reached Fort Edward with the troops ſooner than the 29th
of July (the day that the firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation of proviſions arrived at Fort
George) would not only have been uſeleſs, but alſo highly impolitic;
becauſe the ſubſiſtence of the troops at Fort Edward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
arrival of that embarkation, muſt have been brought by land carriage through
much difficult road all the way from Fort Anne, when, on the contrary, by
remaining in the neighbourhood of Skeneſborough till the paſſage of Lake
George was effected, excluſively of the conſiderations of covering the
removal of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital of Huberton, and alarming the Connecticut by the
poſition of General Reide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel's corps, the army was commodiouſly
ſupplied by water-carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0652302600:104"/> The next circumſtance for examination,
according to the order of the Narrative, is the tranſport of the magazines of
proviſions, &amp;c. from Fort George; and it is highly incumbent upon me to
ſhew the difficulties of that operation, becauſe, if they were avoidable,
it muſt be acknowledged one of the principal grounds upon which I vindicate
the plan of the expedition to Bennington will fail me.</p>
               <p>But I am perſuaded, every candid examiner will firſt indulge me
in a ſhort pauſe. 
<note place="margin">The charges brought againſt the Lt. General's
conduct at this part of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</note>It will be recollected, that this
is the only part of the campaign upon which the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord has laid his
finger, as judging it productive of the ſubſequent events. The
croſs-examination had already been preſſed upon the ſame ideas. Such
want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the nature of tranſport in that country has been
betrayed; ſo much prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of unneceſſary delays has
appeared; 
<note place="margin">Survey of his difficulties and
anxieties</note>ſuch emphaſis of queſtion has attended every
circumſtance of my conduct at this period, that I ſhall ſtand acquitted
of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity, if I preface the application of the ſubſequent evidence by a
more comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and complete ſurvey of the difficulties and anxieties
of my ſituation than I thought was neceſſary before.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Feeding the army.</note>The combination of
arrangement for feeding the army might, in fact, be ſtated to have extended
even to Ireland; for ſome part of the ſupply depended upon the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualling
fleet which was prepared in that country, according to my requiſition before
I left London, and had not reached Quebec when the army took the field. The
te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of the navigation from Quebec to the mouth of the Sorel need
not be again deſcribed. The next embarraſſment was to manage the
conveyance for that part of the ſupply which came from Montreal, and which
was much the greateſt, without interfering with the tranſport which with
equal neceſſity was to be expedited up the Saint Lawrence to Lake Ontario,
for the ſervice of Colonel St. Leger's expedition, and the immenſe ſtores
(then neceſſarily upon the move alſo) for the winter main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the
upper country. To theſe might be added a liſt of chances and
incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, incident to the carrying places between Chamblée and
Saint John's; the uncertaintainty afterwards of the paſſage over Lake
Champlain, and Lake George; the laborious and ſlow operations of drawing the
boats over the iſthmus which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the two Lakes. Theſe together make a
ſyſtem of embarraſſments and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments hardly to be conceived
by thoſe who have not experienced them:</p>
               <p>But although the whole of this arrangement (the furniſhing the
upper country ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) was made under my direction, I have been content to
date my difficulties from the lodgement of the ſupplies at Fort George; and I
have touched the other parts only to ſhew more perſpicuouſly the
unfairneſs of judging of an American cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign upon European ideas. How
zealouſly ſoever a general, in ſuch an undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as mine, may be
ſerved by the chiefs of departments (and much praiſe is due 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0652302600:105"/> from me upon that ſcore) for one hour he can find to
contemplate <hi>how he ſhall fight his army, he muſt allot twenty to
contrive how to feed it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Behaviour of the Indians.</note>The behaviour of
the Indians is a circumſtance too material to be paſſed over in a review
of the anxieties in this part of the campaign. I had diſcerned the caprice,
the ſuperſtition, the ſelf-intereſtedneſs of the Indian character
from my firſt intercourſe, even with thoſe nations which are ſuppoſed
to have made the greateſt progreſs towards civilization: I mean with
thoſe called the domiciliated nations near Montreal. I had been taught to
look upon the remote tribes who joined me at Skeneſboroug, as more warlike;
but a very little time proved that, with equal depravity in general principle,
their only pre-eminence conſiſted in ferocity. 
<note place="margin">Lord Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington from queſt. 6 to 23.</note>The
hopes I had placed in their wild honour, and in the controul of their
conductors, which, as I ſtated before, at firſt had been promiſing, were
ſoon at an end; and their ill-humour and mutinous diſpoſition were
manifeſt ſoon after my arrival at Fort Edward. The apparent cauſes of
their change of temper were the reſentment I had ſhewn upon the murder of
Miſs Macrea, and the reſtraints I had laid on their diſpoſition to
commit other enormities; but I never doubted that their evil paſſions were
fomented, and their defection completed by the cabals of the Canadian
interpreters. Rapacity, ſelf-intereſt, and preſumption are the
characteriſtics of theſe men, with ſome few exceptions. The acquiſition
of the Indian language has uſually been a certain fortune to a man with an
artful head and a convenient conſcience.</p>
               <p>To check the old practices of peculation in theſe men, Sir Guy
Carleton, with great judgment, had given the ſuperintendency of the Indian
department to Major Campbell and Captain Frazer, gentlemen of the higheſt
integrity. The Britiſh officers employed ſolely in the military conduct of
that department, were alſo ſelected with equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. The interpreters
had from the firſt regarded with a jealous eye a ſyſtem which took out of
their hands the diſtribution of Indian neceſſaries and preſents; but
when they found the plunder of the country, as well as that of the government,
was controuled, the profligate policy of many was employed to promote
diſſention, revolt, and deſertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">St. Luc.</note>I take this occaſion to acquit
Monſieur St. Luc of any ſuſpicion of his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in theſe
factions; but I believe he diſcerned them. He certainly knew that the Indians
pined after a renewal of their accuſtomed horrors; and that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as impatient of his controul as of all other, though the pride and intereſt
of authority, and the affection he bore to his old aſſociates, induced him
to cover the real cauſes under various frivolous pretences of diſcontent,
with which I was daily tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, but to which I conſtantly attended: and
though I differed totally with Saint Luc in opinion upon the efficacy of
theſe allies, I invariably took his advice in the <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0652302600:106"/>
management of them, even to an indulgence of their moſt capricious fancies,
when they did not involve the diſhonour of the King's ſervice and the
diſgrace of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. 
<note place="margin">Lord Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington's qu. laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to.</note>The council of the 4th of Auguſt was held at his preſſing
inſtance; and in that council, to my great aſtoniſhment (for he had given
me no intimation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign) the tribes with which he was moſt
particularly connected, and for whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, declared their intention
of returning home, and demanded my concurrence and aſſiſtance. The
embarraſſment of this event was extreme. By acquieſcing, I voluntary
relinquiſhed part of my force that had been obtained with immenſe charge to
government, that had created high expectation at home and abroad, and that
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my own army was by no means in condition to diſpenſe with;
becauſe, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſuppoſed aſſiſtance of this much
over-valued race for ſcouts and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, and all the leſſer, but
neceſſary ſervices, for giving due repoſe to the camp, the Britiſh
light-infantry had been trained to higher purpoſes: they were deſtined to
lead in the general and deciſive combats I expected in the woods, and could
not be ſpared, or riſked, or harraſſed, without palpable conſequences
of the moſt diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able kind.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, I was convinced a cordial reconciliation with the
Indians was only to be effected by a renunciation of all my former prohibitions
and an indulgence in blood and rapine: I had not a friend in the department in
whom I could confide except Major Campbell, Captain Frazer, and the other
Britiſh officers: their ignorance of the languages, and the very probity of
their characters, rendered them of no weight in Indian councils. An anſwer,
nevertheleſs, was to be made upon the moment; and the part I took was to give
a firm refuſal to their propoſition, and to adhere to the controuls I had
before eſtabliſhed; but, with a temperate repreſentation of the ties of
faith, of generoſity, and honour, to join every other argument conſiſtent
with thoſe principles which I could deviſe, to perſuade and encourage
them to continue their ſervices.</p>
               <p>This ſpeech appeared to have the deſired effect. The tribes
neareſt home affected to ſeparate from the others, and only preſſed for
permiſſion to return in parties to gather in their harveſt, propoſing
to relieve each other; which was granted. Some of the remote tribes alſo
ſeemed to retract their propoſitions, and profeſſed a zeal for the
ſervice; but the deſertion took place the next day by ſcores, loaded with
ſuch plunder as they had collected; and it continued from day to day, till
ſcarce a man that had joined at Skeneſborough remained. This whole
tranſaction, I aver, was before the plan of Bennington was formed.

commit them upon parties where they were likely to fall in with the beſt

joined as we advanced. The various intereſts which influenced their actions
rendered all arrangement of them impracticable. One man's views went to the
profit which he was to enjoy when his corps ſhould be complete; another's, to
the protection of the diſtrict in which he reſided; a third was wholly
intent upon revenge againſt his perſonal enemies; and all of them were
repugnant even to an idea of ſubordination. Hence the ſettlement who

to the amount of 1500. This circumſtance may have ſtruck ſome gentlemen,

               <p>This I muſt inſiſt is an unanſwerable defence, with
reſpect to the noble Lord, and thoſe who think with him; for it is ſtrict
and poſitive coincidence with their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, paſt and preſent—and
if I ſaid it will be ſo with thoſe to come, my prophecy would be
authorized by the conviction and triumph which Mr. Galway's evidence,
reſpecting the loyalty of the Americans, ſeemed to produce in the parties
to whom I allude.</p>
               <p>But in due reſpect to other judges, it is incumbent upon me to
ſtate a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious defence.</p>
               <p>As Lieutenant Colonel Kingſton cannot prove juridically that the
rough draft of the deſign which ended the affair of Bennington was the ſame
which was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by General Reideſel, and I am unwilling upon memory to
incur a poſſibility of miſtake, even in an immaterial circumſtance that
reſpects an abſent friend, I am content it ſhould be conſidered as an
uncertaintainty, and I drop all uſe that could be drawn from the original
compoſition. It will fully anſwer my purpoſe to adhere to the bare
aſſertion which I am ſure will never be contradicted, that Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reideſel originally conceived an expedition for the purpoſe of mounting his
dragoons, and ſupplying the troops in general with baggage-horſes; that I
thought his idea might be extended to much greater uſe, and that the plan was
conſidered, amended, and enlarged, in concert with him. 
<note place="margin">Lieut. Col. Kingſton's queſt.</note>Therefore
upon the abſtract ground and reaſon of the meaſure, I might urge, that it
was ſupported by naked military principle, according to the ſentiments of a
general of great natural talents, and long ſervice under the firſt
maſters of the age. It is proved, that the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents were ratified
by the full approbation of Major General Phillips, an officer of ſimilar
deſcription, to whom the plan was communicated; and if a ſingle part of the
ſame plan, mentioned to be at firſt diſapproved by Brigadier General
Frazer, continued to be ſo after explanation, that diſapprobation did not
appear. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the utmoſt that can be drawn from the evidence of Lieutenant
Colonel <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0652302600:111"/> Kingſton, or any other witneſs, amounts to
no more than an implied wiſh in the Brigadier to have conducted the
expedition at the head of his diſtinct corps. It was the fact. Devoted to
glory and prodigal of life; earneſt for the general ſucceſs of the
campaign, and particularly anxious for every plan adopted by the man he loved,
he grudged a danger or care in other hands than his own. It was not envy or
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of the German troops, but zeal and impatience for employment,
that influenced his predilection for the Britiſh. I honoured the principle,
while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained it; and I reſerved his ardour and judgment for a
ſecond movement, which required thoſe qualities much more than the
expedition to Bennington did, according to any intelligence or appearance of
things at the time. It will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the evidence, that the whole of
Brigadier Fraſer's corps was thrown over the river, and actually poſted at
the opening of the plain near Saratoga, when Col. Baume marched; and the
deſign was, upon the firſt news of Baume's ſucceſs, to have puſhed
that corps to take poſſeſſion of the heights near Stillwater, and to
have intrenched there, till the army and the proviſion could have joined, by
which means the whole country on the weſt ſide the river, to the banks of
the Mohawk, would have been our own.</p>
               <p>But moreover it is to be obſerved, that Major General Reideſel
was far from being ignorant, as has been ſuggeſted, of the nature of the
country, or the profeſſions of the inhabitants. He was juſt returned from
commanding a detached corps at a conſiderable diſtance from the main army,
in the very heart of the country from which the enemy's force at Bennington was
afterwards ſupplied. He ſpoke the Engliſh language well; he was
aſſiſted by many natives of the beſt information.</p>
               <p>It is evident, that the brave but deceived officer who commanded the
detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was induced to deviate from the cautions preſcribed in the
inſtructions. A plan drawn by an engineer upon the ſpot is added to the
evidence produced to the committee, to ſhew more clearly where that deviation
happened. 
<note place="margin">Lord Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington's q. 28 to 31.</note>It appears
alſo in proof, that the meaſures taken to relieve Colonel Baume, upon the
news of his difficulty, were the moſt ſpeedy that could be uſed, and
would have been time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, had not Colonel Brieman's march been more tardy than
could have been ſuppoſed poſſible. I take the fact as ſtated in his
own account, without impeaching his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with regard to the obſtacles he
deſcribes. But as a farther vindication of the intelligence and principle
upon which the original ſtrength of the detachment was framed, and the mere
accident which made even error poſſible, I requeſt admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the
proof of a new fact which I did not know it was in my power to bring, till
after Captain Money had left the bar of the Houſe of Commons; and as I was
precluded from calling him a ſecond time, by the abrupt cloſe of the
proceedings, I had no other way of laying it before the public, than by
ſtating the queſtion in <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0652302600:112"/> writing, and requiring his
authority to publiſh the anſwer, which I obtained, and they are as
follows:</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any circumſtance reſpecting an unexpected
reinforcement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the rebels at Bennington near the time of the
action?</p>
               <p>A. 
<q rend="inline">"A few days after I was priſoner in the rebel
camp, ſome of their officers told me, that it was a providential
circumſtance, that General Starks was coming through Bennington with 1200
militia of the New-Hampſhire Grants, to join their main army near Albany, for
the guard on the proviſion at Bennington did not amount to more than 400 men;
and that on his hearing of a detachment of our army being only four or five
miles from him, he with the guard, and what militia could be collected in the
neighbourhood, attacked and defeated the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, as well as the
reinforcement that were on their march to join them. The rebel officers alſo
informed me, and I have ſeen accounts that agree with what I then heard, that
during the action General Starks was 'luckily' joined by Colonel Warner with a
conſiderable body of men. I have frequently heard our officers ſay that
were in this action, that had Colonel Baume retreated four miles, and
recroſſed the river he paſſed the day before, and taken poſt there,
when he found by information he could not proceed, and had wrote for a
rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, he would have met Colonel Breiman coming to his
aſſiſtance, and would not have riſqued the loſs of his corps, which
by his inſtructions were ſo ſtrongly recommended, as not even to riſque
a conſiderable loſs. This, Sir, is as nearly as poſſible the anſwer I
ſhould have given had the queſtion been aſked me in the Houſe of
Commons.—J. Money."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This piece of evidence will ſerve to ſhew that it was not the
ſucceſs of the rebels at Bennington that animated the militia to
aſſemble, and march in the cauſe of the Congreſs; and he muſt be of
ſteady faith indeed in American loyalty who can ſuppoſe much of it really
exiſted in the country of the Hampſhire Grants (howſoever it had been
affected and profeſſed) when he reflects, not only that General Starks and
Colonel Warner were not oppoſed in collecting their men, though my army, then
in a tide of ſucceſs, were near at hand; but alſo that not a loyaliſt
was found earneſt enough to convey me intelligence.</p>
               <p>It will likewiſe appear, from this piece of evidence, when
compared with the map of the country and the diſpoſition of the troops,
that had not the accidental paſſage of the detachments under Starks and
Warner been exceedingly critical, it could not have availed.—Forty-eight
hours ſooner, they would have joined General Gates; and he would hardly have
detached them, or any other part of his force, back to Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, even though
he had heard of a movement to my left; becauſe he muſt have known that the
whole of Fraſer's corps lay ready to march rapidly upon him from my 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0652302600:113"/> right.—Forty-eight hours later, the blow would
have been ſtruck; and the ſtores, conſiſting of live cattle, and
flower, with abundant carriages to convey it, would have been out of reach.</p>
               <p>Another reflection will be apt to ariſe in ſpeculative minds
upon this ſubject, viz. on what nice chances depends the reputation of an
officer who acts under ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh and ungenerous employers! Such men not only
with-hold the fair protection that would ariſe from an explanation of his
motives, but are the firſt to join the cry of the uninformed multitude, who
always judge by events. Thus every plan receives a colouring in the extreme;
and is denominated (often with equal injuſtice) a fatal error or a brilliant
enterprize.</p>

deſigned againſt Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington. I really do not ſee to what it could tend
againſt me, if that ſuppoſition were in a great degree admitted. That
ſome part of the force was deſigned to act there, will not be diſputed by
any who read Colonel Baume's inſtructions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the map. The blame
or merit of the deſign altogether, muſt reſt upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of
expediency; and it is of little conſequence whether the firſt and principal
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was againſt Bennington, or Arlington, or any other diſtrict, as
my intelligence might have varied reſpecting the depoſits of corn and
cattle of the enemy. At the ſame time I muſt obſerve it is begging the
queſtion, to argue that Bennington was not the real, original object,
becauſe Bennington was not mentioned in the draft of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. A man
muſt indeed be void of military and political addreſs, to put upon paper a
critical deſign, where ſurprize was in queſtion, and every thing depended
upon ſecreſy. Though it were true, that I meant only Bennington, and
thought of nothing leſs than the progreſs of the expedition, in the extent
of the order, I certainly would not now affirm it, becauſe I could not prove
it; and becauſe it would ſeem, that I ſearched for remote and obſcure
juſtification, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon that which was manifeſt; but ſurely
there is nothing new or improbable in the idea, that a general ſhould
diſguiſe his real intentions at the outſet of an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even from
the officer whom he appointed to execute them, provided a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with
that officer was certain and not remote.</p>
               <p>This review of the affair of Bennington, tho' long, I truſt will
not be deemed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed; and from the different parts of it, I think, will
clearly be eſtabliſhed the few following aſſertions.</p>
               <p>1ſt. That the deſign upon Bennington was juſtified by the
circumſtances of the time.</p>
               <p>2d. That there was no reaſon to ſuppoſe the force of the enemy
there greater than what the detachment was adequate to defeat.</p>
               <p>3d. That when the force was diſcovered to be greater, the ill
conſequences would have been avoided had not Colonel Baume deviated from his
inſtructions, by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0652302600:114"/> his regular force in the
woods inſtead of fortifying a poſt in the open country, and exploring the
woods only with the Indians, Canadians, and Provincials, ſupported by Captain

unattended with any loſs that could affect the main ſtrength of the army,
and little more than the miſcarriage of a forag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party, to have been fatal
to a whole campaign, of which he had directed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and apportioned

diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment at Bennington. Lieut. Col. Kingſton, q. 24 to 31.</note>The
next claſs of proofs in regular progreſſion, applies to the difficulty of
bringing forward a magazine of proviſion, after the diſappointment of
obtaining live ſtock and flower at Bennington. It has been ſhewn, by the
evidence of Captain Money, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel Kingſton, and the authentic
memorandums of Sir Francis Clarke, that early in the month of Auguſt it was
no eaſy taſk to ſupply the daily conſumption of the army. Our powers
were afterwards, in ſome degree, encreaſed by the arrival of more contract
horſes, acquiſitions of more ox-teams from the country, and the great
vigilance exerted in the departments of the quarter-maſter-general and
inſpector, whoſe aſſiſtants had been augmented.</p>
               <p>A minute inveſtigation of this operation I am ſenſible will be
thought dry, and perhaps unneceſſary, by general readers—they will
paſs it over—but there are thoſe who have laid much ſtreſs upon a
waſte of time, and who take delight in tracing the ſmall parts of a
ſubject with ſcrupulous exactneſs. With ſuch it is my duty, as a
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on my defence, to enter into detail, and I will lay my ground in the
queſtion put to Captain Money in his croſs-examination and his
anſwer.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the Army remain from the 16th of Auguſt to the 13th of
September 
<q rend="inline">"before they croſſed the Hudſon's-River to
engage the Rebels at Stillwater?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>A. 
<q rend="inline">"To bring forward a ſufficient quantity of
proviſions and artillery, to enable the General to give up his
communication."</q>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Capt. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, q. 20; and for the general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the efforts uſed ſee the ſame evidence from q. 12 to 25.</note>With
all the powers of conveyance poſſible to be muſtered, Captain Money
computes, (and his computation tallies nearly with the table formed by the
Commiſſary-General) that five days proviſion, viz. four for forming the
magazine and one for daily conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was the moſt that could be
conveyed at once.</p>
               <p>To bring this to an average I will aſſume only two days for
accidents of weather, roads, fatigue of cattle, breaking of carriages, and
other common diſappointments: this is much leſs time than according to the
evidence might be allowed, and upon This computation it would take ten days to
convey the magazine to Fort Edward only. <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0652302600:115"/> The ſtage
from thence to the encampment and intended depoſitary muſt not be computed
by diſtance but by impediments. The rapids of the river and the different
carrying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places have been deſcribed by the witneſſes, and it reſults
that this ſtage was much longer in point of time than the former one. It was
not poſſible to keep the tranſports going at both ſtages together for
the ten days mentioned, becauſe there were not boats in the river
ſufficient for more than the daily ſupply; nor could they have been
conveyed there in that time by any poſſible means, for theſe reaſons;
the boat carriages, which were of a conſtruction ſimilar to timber
carriages uſed in England, were only twelve in number, and each carriage
employed ſix horſes or four oxen to draw it; and could any other means of
draft for boats over land have been contrived, or cattle have been ſupplied
from the artillery, or any other department, all would have been uſeleſs;
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the boats themſelves, to a greater amount than thoſe above
ſpecified, were wanting till after the whole of the proviſion tranſport
between Ticonderoga and Fort George, upon which they were employed, was
finiſhed, and it had barely kept pace ſo as to ſupply the land
tranſport between Fort George and Fort Edward.</p>
               <p>I deſire only an allowance of fifteen days for the carriage over
the ſecond ſtage, and it will thus take, in the whole, twenty-five days to
form the magazine alone.</p>
               <p>I claim no additional allowance of time for conveying one hundred
boats, at leaſt, through the difficulties of land and water, in the two
ſtages, but compriſe that labour among the reſt of the laſt fifteen
days. It muſt be nevertheleſs obſerved, that even this number was ſhort
of what was wanting, and, to ſave time, all the artificers were employed in
building ſcouls (fourteen of which were finiſhed during the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
to make water craft, in the whole ſufficient to carry the magazine forward,
after the communication ſhould be at an end. The new caulking the boats,
though indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly neceſſary to great part of them, after
paſſing the lakes loaded, and afterwards being ſhaken and damaged by land
carriage, is another work which I throw into the laſt fifteen days of the
tranſport, or into the ſubſequent four days, which muſt at the leaſt
be allotted for loading the magazine, and arranging the order of its proceeding
both in reſpect to navigation and defence. This was committed to very expert
naval officers, and was matter of no trivial concern, or eaſy execution.</p>
               <p>The whole buſineſs, according to the above repreſentation and
calculation, both which are founded upon evidence, would have taken twenty-nine
days: twenty-ſeven only were employed, viz. from Auguſt the 16th to
September the 13th. The exertions in fact, outwent the calculation; and I
challenge the moſt minute ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, to try the time and the powers
we poſſeſſed, by every poſſible diſtribution of carriages and
cattle, different from that which was practiſed, and I will venture to ſay
none will be found leſs dilatory.</p>
               <p>It appears clearly in proof, that no impediment to this tranſport
was occaſioned by the interference of the artillery; but it has been implied
by ſome queſtions in the croſs <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0652302600:116"/> examinations, that
if the artillery did not interfere with the tranſport, the tranſport ought
to have interfered with the artillery, and that by appropriating their horſes
to the proviſion train, much time might have been ſaved.</p>
               <p>It might be a ſufficient anſwer, that the artillery, for the
reaſons I have before aſſigned was not to be diſpenſed with, and
conſequently the horſes were to be preſerved: but I beſides have
ſhewn, that they could not have been of uſe to the tranſport of the
boats; and to ſatisfy every ſcruple, and to ſhew how miſtaken they are
who ſuppoſe an advantage was to be obtained by the employment of artillery
horſes to convey pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, I now offer to their reflection the
additional fact, that they could have been of no avail, becauſe we had
neither carts nor pack-ſaddles, more than were in uſe already.</p>

               <p>Having thus ſhewn that the tranſport of proviſion and other
ſtores, for about thirty days, was effected in the ſhorteſt time

                  <note place="margin">Queſtion made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the army might not have
proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Albany without ſtores? Idea of a rapid march.</note>the
queſtion, which has been very much canvaſſed in print, and by the croſs
exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, appears to have made impreſſion upon ſome gentlemen;
whether this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might not have been diſpenſed with, and the army
have reached Albany by a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid march, the ſoldiers carrying upon their backs
a ſufficiency of proviſion to ſupport them during the time.</p>
               <p>It is very natural for men of all deſcriptions, to apply the idea
of a rapid march to a diſtance of fifty miles, for it is not more meaſuring
in a ſtreight line from Fort Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Albany, and it will be proper to
conſider the principle and practibility of ſuch march, with reſpect to
two diſtinct periods, the one before, the other after the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon
Bennington.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the firſt, it will be remembered, that in the
ſtate the roads then were, and with the reſources then to be employed, no
proviſion before-hand was attainable. Therefore, to have brought the plan of
a rapid advance within the compaſs of a poſſibility, the operation muſt
have begun by marching the whole rapidly backward, in order to load the men
with their packs of proviſions. How the troops, zealous as they were, would
have reliſhed a ſtep ſo uncommon in its nature, and productive of ſo
much unexpected fatigue, particularly how the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans would have been ſo
perſuaded of the neceſſity as to have undertaken it with good will,
cannot be aſcertained.</p>
               <p>But theſe doubts apart, it remains to be conſidered, how the
troops were to paſs two very large rivers, the Hudſon and the Mohawk,
without previous proviſion for a bridge, or water-craft for conveying large
bodies at once. Every conceſſion a ſanguine projector can deſire
ſhall be made upon this point alſo; the contrivance of rafts, bound
together by twigs and ſtrips of bark, as in fact was practiſed at this very
period for the paſſage of Fraſer's corps over Hudſon's River, ſhall
be admitted equally practicable for the whole army; and in argument be it
truſted to chance to paſs the Mohawk in the ſame way; or ſhould it
fail, let recourſe be had to the ford, which is known to be practicable,
<hi>except after heavy rains,</hi> near Schenectady, about fifteen miles from
the mouth of the river.</p>
               <p>Theſe conceſſions granted, we will ſuppoſe the army on the
bank of the Hudſon's River, where they afterwards paſſed it.</p>
               <p>The idea of a rapid march will of courſe be exempt from all
thought of perſonal incumbrances (proviſion exempted) and the ſoldier
will ſtand repreſented in the imagination, trim and nimble as he is ſeen
at an exerciſe in an Engliſh encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—Indeed <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0652302600:118"/> it is neceſſary he ſhould be conſidered in that form; for
nothing can be more repugnant to a project of rapidity, than the ſoldier's
load, were he to carry all the articles belonging to him in a campaign.<note n="*" place="bottom">They conſiſt of a knapſack, containing his bodily

               <p>But it may be ſaid, and with truth, that troops are uſually
relieved from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of this burthen, and many examples of this
relief may be brought from the general cuſtom of ſervice, and from many
movements of General Howe's army in particular—nay more, it was a
frequent practice of the very army in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to march free from
knapſacks and camp equipage. The Wigwam, or hut conſtructed of boughs, may
be made a very wholeſome ſubſtitute for a tent; and when victual can be
cooked before-hand, even the camp kettle for an expeditious march may be laid
aſide. All theſe examples are admitted: but they all imply conveniencies
for the ſeveral articles to follow, and to be brought up in due time. In our
caſe they muſt have been loſt irrecoverably.</p>
               <p>Will it be argued, that ſome medium might have been deviſed? And
although it were impoſſible, conſiſtently with the idea of rapidity, to
carry forward more proviſion than for bare ſuſtenance during the march,
yet carts might have been found ſufficient to carry the men's knapſacks,
and camp kettles, and other indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible articles? This ſuppoſition
would betray a great ignorance of the country. From Saratoga to Albany there is
only one road practicable for wheel carriage. There are many places where by
deſtroying the bridges over deep gullies which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves into
the main river, a paſſage would be rendered impoſſible, not only for a
wheel carriage, but a horſe. There are others where the road is bounded by
the river on one ſide, and by almoſt perpendicular aſcents covered with
wood on the other. Here the very ſhort work of felling a few trees would
ſtop all paſſage. The expence of time to remove theſe obſtructions,
or to make new roads, would have brought famine. All notion, therefore, of
conveying any articles more than could be carried upon men's ſhoulders muſt
ceaſe. The notion of artillery, even the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt pieces, muſt alſo
ceaſe of courſe, not even a little ammunition-tumbril could have found its
way.—An eaſy ſacrifice to the theoriſts, who have maintained the
inutility of artillery: but any officer who has ſeen the ground of this
ſuppoſed march, would point out a dozen paſſes, not to ſpeak of the
paſſage of the Mohawk, where, ſtrengthened with abattis and ſuch other
works as the rebels are expert in making in a very few hours, five hundred
militia would ſtop for a time, ten times their number of the beſt troops in
the world who had not artillery to aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0652302600:119"/> Having ſtated theſe objections to the
principle of a rapid march, let us now, from the knowledge that has been
ſince obtained of circumſtances, conſider what would have been the
certain conſequences of the attempt.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with the capricious workings of the
tempers of men, will not wonder at the difficulty of prevailing upon a common
ſoldier in any exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency to huſband his proviſions. In a ſettled camp,
the young ſoldier has very ſhort fare on the fourth day after delivery: but
upon a march in bad weather and bad roads, when the weary foot ſlips back at
every ſtep, and a general curſe is provoked at the weight that cauſes the
retardment, he muſt be a patient veteran, and of much experience in
ſcarcity, who is not tempted to throw the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the haverſack
into the mire. He feels the preſent incumbrance grievous—Want is a day
remote.— 
<q rend="inline">"Let the General find a ſupply: it is the King's
cauſe and the General's intereſt—he will never let the ſoldier be
ſtarved."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is common reaſoning in the ranks. I ſtate it for thoſe
who have not ſeen fatiguing ſervice, and may have a judgment to form upon
it. It need not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the preſent conſideration; for had the march
taken place at the time it ought to have done, upon the principle of the
defenders of that ſcheme, the time that Fraſer's corps firſt paſt the
river upon the bridge of rafts, waſte would only have conſpired to
accompliſh in <hi>three days</hi> a ruin that with the beſt huſbandry
would have been inevitable in <hi>ſix:</hi> for the ſame fall of rain which
it has been ſhewn in evidence actually carried away the bridge a very few
days after it was conſtructed, neceſſarily made the ford of the Mohawk
for an advance, and every ford of the Hudſon's River for a return,
impaſſable. It hardly need be noticed, that a flood muſt have made any
uſe of rafts, could they have been timely obtained, equally impracticable.
The army, therefore, would have become victims to famine, without a blow, or a
ſingle effort of the enemy. Saratoga muſt have been the anticipated ſcene
of ſurrender, without other conditions than the mercy of ſuſtenance; the
whole force of Mr. Gates would have been looſe to co-operate with Mr.
Waſhington, with the fineſt ſeaſon of the campaign before them; and the
General of the northern army, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſhadow of profeſſional defence,
and precluded from the plea uſually ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive, that he fought hard
before he failed, muſt have met the cenſure of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and a
juſtly offended country, with none to ſupport him but the preſent
advocates of a rapid march. Could his dependence have been ſure even upon
them? Would they not rather have adhered to their oppoſite and original
ſyſtem (for ſtrange as it is, the ſame men have ſupported both) and
have aſſerted, that it was extreme raſhneſs to croſs the Hudſon's
River at all?</p>
               <p>If what I have ſaid in objection to the principle and
practicability of a rapid march to Albany, previous to the attempt upon
Bennington, has weight, very little need be added on the ſubject afterwards,
becauſe every objection will multiply up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0652302600:120"/> the mind
of the moſt curſory obſerver. I ſhall only call the attention to a very
few eſſential circumſtances. The enemy was in force; a proof of his being
ſo is, that Mr. Gates quitted his poſition behind the Mohawk, which was his
ſtrongeſt, and advanced to Stillwater. The force found at Bennington upon
the march from the Hampſhire Grants to the main army, proved the vigour and
ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity of the enemy in that country. The circumſtances of the action at
Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton eſtabliſhed a yet more melancholy conviction of the fallacy of
any dependence upon ſuppoſed friends. The noble Lord has ſaid, that 
<q rend="inline">"I never deſpaired of the campaign before the
affair of Bennington; that I had no doubt of gaining Albany in as ſhort a
time as the army (in due condition of ſupply) could accompliſh the
march."</q> I acknowledge the truth of the aſſertions in their fulleſt
extent; all my letters at the time ſhew it. I will go further, and in one
ſenſe apply with the noble Lord the epithet "fatal" to the affair of
Bennington. The knowledge I acquired of the profeſſors of loyalty was
"fatal," and put an end to every expectation from enterprize unſuſtained by
dint of force. It would have been exceſs of fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy to have truſted for
ſuſtenance to the plentiful region of Albany. Had the march thither been
practicable in all reſpects, and even unoppoſed, (which nobody will think
would have been the caſe) the enemy finding the Britiſh army unſupplied,
would only have had to compel the Tories to drive the cattle and deſtroy the
corn or the corn mills, and the convention of Albany inſtead of Saratoga
muſt have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Would the Tories have riſen? Why did they not riſe
round Albany and below it, at the time they found Mr. Gates's army increaſing
by ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct parties from remote diſtances? They were better
qualified by their ſituation to catch the favourable moment than I was to
adviſe it. Why did they not riſe in that populous and as ſuppoſed well
affected diſtrict, the German Flats, at the time St. Leger was before Fort
Stanwix? A critical inſurrection from any one point of the compaſs within
diſtance to create diverſion, would probably have ſecured the ſucceſs
of the campaign.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Col. St. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's letter. No. V.</note>But to
revert to the encreaſe of reaſons againſt a rapid march after the affair
of Bennington. It was then alſo known, that by the falſe intelligence
reſpecting the ſtrength of Fort Stanwix, the infamous behaviour of the
Indians, and the want of the promiſed co-operation of the loyal inhabitants,
Lieut. Col. St. Leger had been obliged to retreat. The firſt plauſible
motive in favour of hazardous haſte, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating his deſcent of the
Mohawk, was thus at an end. The proſpect of finding the enemy diſperſed
it has before been ſhewn was over.</p>
               <p>The impoſſibility of preſerving a communication was alſo
evident. Was the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to have proceeded to action without hoſpital ſtores,
as well as without victual? The general who carries troops into fire without
precautions to alleviate the certain conſequences, takes a ſure ſtep to
alienate the affections, and deſtroy the ardour of <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0652302600:121"/> the
ſoldier—he exacts more than human ſpirit can furniſh. Men need not
be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated to fields of battle to be convinced of this truth. Let the mind
reſt for a moment on the objects which will riſe within it after the
mention of action, and then reflect, there is not a mattraſs for broken
bones, nor a cordial for agony and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They who talk of theſe rapid
marches, ſuppoſe no oppoſition, or no ſuffering in conſequence of
oppoſition. The hundreds of wounded men to be cruelly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned (if the
reſt could be prevailed upon to abandon thoſe whoſe caſe might the next
day be their own) make no part of the conſideration of theſe gentlemen of
precipitate imaginations. But officers who are reſponſible to God and their
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for the armies they conduct, cannot ſo eaſily overlook ſuch
objects; and muſt be patient at leaſt till a few hundred beds, and a proper
proportion of medicine and chirurgical materials, can be brought up for troops
that are to fight as well as to march.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of rapid movement has run into much length: the
ſtreſs laid upon it in the croſs-examination, was the cauſe. I beg
leave very ſhortly to reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate the principal points, and ſhall then
diſmiſs it to the public judgment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great apprehenſion of having
it renewed even in ſpeculation.</p>
               <p>Had a proper ſtore of live cattle been obtained by the expedition
to Bennington, (and by the bye it will be remembered, that had the loyaliſts
of the country been really of the number and deſcription repreſented, that
acquiſition might have been made without an action) all the carriages might
have been appropriated ſolely to the conveyance of flour, hoſpital
accommodations, entrenching tools, and other abſolute neceſſaries; and a
rapid march to Albany might have been hazarded.</p>
               <p>After the expedition to Bennington had failed of that great
purpoſe, had a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon for Ticonderoga been attainable from Canada, and
the force then at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga been brought forward, to eſtabliſh a poſt
of communication, and ſecure a paſſage of the river by a fortified
bridge, and redoubts upon the heights which every where command the river, on
one ſhore or the other, a forced march might ſtill have been juſtifiable,
becauſe a retreat was ſecure: but, diveſted of both theſe reſources,
a rapid movement muſt inevitably have led to rapid ruin.</p>
               <p>Having gone through all the material points previous to the 13th of
September, and ſhewn, I truſt, by diſtinct evidence, as well as
reaſoning, the expediency of the march from Skeneſborough to Fort Edward;
the principle of the expedition to Bennington; the cauſe of its failure; the
efforts uſed to bring forwards the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and neceſſary ſtores,
and the impracticability of proceeding without thoſe ſtores; 
<note place="margin">Review of the meaſure of paſſing the

               <p>I entered pretty fully, in my Narrative, into the principles which

Brigadier Fraſer's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.</note>has been led to doubt whether I was
required by duty, ſituation, the voice of the army, and the voice of
reaſon, to advance and fight, to follow the conſideration of thoſe
principles, with a reviſal of the applicable part of the verbal evidence, and
I will then venture further to appeal to their judgment, whether, inſtead of
being required, I was not compelled, by the ſtate of things, to act as I did;
even inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of the peremptory tenor of my orders, which, confident in
the ſtrength of my caſe, I have purpoſely omitted, upon this occaſion,
to reconſider.</p>
               <p>In regard to the point ſo much agitated in this country, though
with no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever from any thing that happened in America, Brigadier

River, it would be trifling with the patience of the reader to recapitulate and
point the evidence to a matter which I do not believe there is a man ſo
prejudiced as now to diſpute, viz. that that officer joined in opinion and
impatience with the reſt of the army. But though the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods ſo
groſsly and ſo long impoſed upon the public, reſpecting this matter,
are no more, it may not be unworthy curioſity to explore their origin and
trace their progreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Progreſs of the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</note>It is not difficult to diſcern that the ſuſpicion of
difference of opinion in the army, upon the meaſure of paſſing the
Hudſon's River, aroſe from the paragraph in my public letter from Albany to
the Secretary of State, wherein I ſay that I had called no council upon that
ſubject, but had acted upon my own judgment of the peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory tenor of my
orders.</p>
               <p>That a man, chief in authority, ſhould take entirely upon
himſelf a meaſure of doubtful conſequence, and upon mere principle
preclude himſelf from any future means of ſhifting or dividing the blame
that might enſue, appeared incredible at Whitehall: the greater part of that
political ſchool concluded the profeſſion of ſuch candour muſt be a
fineſſe, and that, in fact, the General had not communicated with his
officers, becauſe he knew opinions would have been againſt him.</p>
               <p>When little minds think they have got a clue of littleneſs it is
wonderful with what zeal and dexterity they purſue and improve it.
Correſpondence and intelligence were not wanting; diſappointed jobbers,
diſcarded ſervants, diſſatisfied fugitives of every ſort, ſpies,
tale-bearers, and ſycophants, whom it is to the honour of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to have
his enemies, and a diſgrace to Office to encourage, abounded in town; and the
primary idea once given, it was carried forward by very ready aſſiſtance,
and even logical deduction.—As thus:</p>
               <p>The General declares in his diſpatch, he called no man into
council upon the meaſure of paſſing the Hudſon's River:
<hi>Therefore,</hi> his officers differed in opinion upon the expediency of
advancing.</p>
               <p>To differ in opinion upon that expediency, they muſt conſtrue
his orders not to be peremptory: <hi>Therefore,</hi> he ſtands ſingle in
the interpretation he put upon his orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0652302600:123"/> If his officers ſaw that he was
unadviſedly and deſparately leading his army to death, they would certainly
remonſtrate: <hi>Therefore,</hi> they remonſtrated.</p>
               <p>The remonſtrance would naturally be made to him by ſuperior
officers: <hi>Therefore,</hi> the concluſion follows; Major General Phillips
and Brigadier General Fraſer actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made a remonſtrance againſt
paſſing the Hudſon's River.</p>
               <p>General Reideſel, who was next in rank to General Phillips,
ſeems to have been forgotten. He was probably overlooked in the eagerneſs
to get at General Fraſer, on whoſe name the important ſtreſs was laid,
and for two palpable reaſons; the one, that his name ſtood high in the
public eſtimation, and greatly as it deſerved ſo to ſtand, perhaps it
acquired, upon this intended uſe, more juſtice from ſome quarters than it
would otherwiſe have received.</p>
               <p>The ſecond and more prevalent reaſon was, that Brigadier General
Fraſer was dead.</p>
               <p>Thus then ſtood the aſſertion when I arrived in England: 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Major General Phillips and Brigadier General
Fraſer remonſtrated againſt paſſing the Hudſon's River, which
movement was the cauſe of all the ſubſequent misfortunes.</hi>"</q> And
having traced this falſehood to its maturity, it now may be equally curious
to follow its decline.</p>
               <p>After my arrival in England, the friendſhip, and general
conformity of ſentiment between General Phillips and me became more known. He
was alive, and might poſſibly ſoon return. His name was therefore
withdrawn from the remonſtrance, and reſerved, in caſe he did not return,
to give colour to a ſecond falſehood,<note n="*" place="bottom">That General
Phillips offered to conduct a part of the army from Saratoga to Ticonderoga.

Kingſton, &amp;c.</note> then kept back, but ſince produced as one of the
laſt efforts of malignity in the courſe of the late enquiry.</p>
               <p>The firſt public occaſion that offered was ſeized by me to
pledge my honour upon the whole ſtory of diſagreement of opinion being
falſe; and I dared any man to produce a letter or a ſentence, from
Brigadier Fraſer or any other officer, to authoriſe a ſuſpicion of its
being true. Lieutenant General Fraſer, upon the ſame occaſion in the
Houſe of Commons, voluntarily and generouſly entered into my
juſtification, upon the authority of his correſpondence with his late
relation, and the knowledge of his general ſentiments.</p>
               <p>The falſehood was immediately ſo far weakened, that the word

                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>Brigadier Fraſer's opinion was againſt

aſſiſted and cheriſhed, when it was very languid, by a whiſper,

Balcarras, Lord Harrington, <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0652302600:124"/> Colonel Kingſton, &amp;c.
gave the death blow to the laſt ſtruggling efforts of that calumny. The
raſhneſs of paſſing the Hudſon's River was obliterated; every
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that <hi>fatal</hi> ſtep was ſuddenly dropt, as if the river
had ſunk under ground; the charge, with the full accompaniment of General
Fraſer's diſapprobation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, &amp;c. &amp;c. was ſhifted;
the miniſter was as nimble as his confederates, and exclaimed upon the
<hi>fatality</hi> of the expedition to Bennington.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall finally reſt the ſupport I have been ſo
anxious to derive from that grave which has been ranſacked by my
adverſaries for evidence againſt me. As a ſoldier I avow a pride in
having poſſeſſed Brigadier Fraſer's eſteem. As a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant I am
ſenſible I have dwelt upon it to a fault. 
<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an inferior offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

ſuffering the comments of an inferior to be a teſt of his actions, requires
an apology to my profeſſion. It lies in the eminence of my friend's
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. His approbation gave a grace to my defence, and I was impatient to
confute the calumny that would have robbed me of it; but to admit that it was
neceſſary for my acquittal would be to countenance and forward the moſt
pernicious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous doctrine that ever was practiſed to miſlead
the public, and to betray the ſervice.</p>
               <p>When a miniſter or his confederates lean upon private report,
table talk, and half ſentences, to depreciate an officer they dare not
themſelves accuſe, it is a feebleneſs of vengeance that, in its firſt
aſpect, is contemptible in the extreme; but it calls for our indignation when
we extend our view to its principle and effects. They operate to the very
inverſion of due patronage, and the abſolute extinction of every idea upon
which command ought to be beſtowed, or can efficaciouſly be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed;
they tend to encourage officers to be ſpies and informers; to render camps
and fleets, properly the reſidence of harmony and honour, the ſeats of
ſuſpicion, diſcord, faction, treachery, and mutiny.</p>
               <p>The diverſity and importance of the matter brought to review in
the period of the campaign I am now cloſing, has led to greater length than I
was aware of; but I cannot diſmiſs it without one reference, addreſſed
to ſuch of the examiners of my conduct as have inſiſted upon the
tardineſs of the northern army.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Comparative view of the campaigns in 1759 and
1777.</note>The reference I would plead is to a campaign in the ſame country,
memorable for having been conducted by an officer whoſe example muſt be
acknowledged, at this juncture, to be of ſplendid and peculiar authority; I
mean the campaign of Lord Amherſt, in the year 1759.</p>
               <p>The great points of the war in America that year were to divide the
enemy's force, and at the ſame time to direct the ſeveral operations with
ſuch concurrence, that, though ſeparate and remote, they ſhould
aſſiſt each other. The firſt objects of the <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0652302600:125"/> army
to which I allude were to reduce Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and moſt important one was to effect a junction with Mr. Wolfe before
Quebec.</p>
               <p>Thus far there is great ſimilarity between the plans of the two
campaigns, except that the points from which the armies marched, and to which
they were deſtined, were exactly reverſed.</p>
               <p>In the Spring, 1759, the army, then aſſembled at Albany, took
the field as early as the ſeaſon would admit: but ſuch were the natural
impediments of the country, that though ſupported by the unanimous zeal of
the inhabitants, and furniſhed with abundant ſupplies of draft cattle,
carriages, water-craft, and every other neceſſary; the ſeveral
departments well directed, and no enemy to oppoſe the march, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
(Lord Amherſt) was not able to commence the attack of Ticonderoga till the
7th of July, when the enemy abandoned that poſt, and retreated to Crown
Point.</p>
               <p>The diſtance from Albany to Fort George is between ſixty and
ſeventy miles, the paſſage over Lake George to Ticonderoga about forty
miles.</p>
               <p>The General had reaſon to believe that Crown Point would be given
up at his approach as precipitately as Ticonderoga had been. He did not,
however, reach it, a diſtance of thirteen miles, and water-carriage at will,
till the 14th of Auguſt.</p>
               <p>Was it at that time aſked by the miniſter or his adherents, what
was the army doing not to purſue a flying enemy?—Not to purſue when
the whole country behind was their own, and magazines, baggage, hoſpitals,
and every other neceſſary, might follow at leiſure, and in ſecurity!
When it was foreſeen an encreaſe of fleet was to be conſtructed at Crown
Point, to obtain the ſuperiority over the enemy upon Lake Champlain, and
conſequently that every day's delay, in becoming maſter of that poſt,
riſked the campaign!</p>
               <p>Although theſe enquiries were not then ſuggeſted to the
public, an anſwer to them has been given, greatly to the honour of the
General, in a very impartial hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of that time. 
<q rend="inline">"The army was employed in repairing the
fortifications at Ticonderoga; and the General took his meaſures with the
ſame care as if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected an obſtinate defence, and attempt to
ſurpriſe him on his march."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The enemy actually did abandon Crown Point on the approach of the
General, the 14th of Auguſt; and, as ſoon as in poſſeſſion of that
poſt, he ſet about fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as he had done Ticonderoga. The time
conſumed in that operation, and in building new veſſels, brought it to
the middle of October before the General could embark upon the Lake. A
ſuſpence, undoubtedly, of great anxiety; for the great end of the campaign,
the junction of the two armies, upon which the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Canada was
thought to depend, was unattained.</p>
               <p>But did the miniſter or his adherents <hi>then</hi> cavil at the
tardineſs of that army?—Enterpriſing, ſanguine, and impetuous, as
was the character of that miniſter's <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0652302600:126"/> councils, there
was not leſs energy in his protection. The nation, not a party, were his
adherents; and his word was a <hi>fiat</hi> of fame. He beſtowed emphatic
praiſes on his General; and a failing campaign became part of that baſis,
from which he has aſcended to the high honours he now deſervedly
poſſeſſes.</p>
               <p>It would be great preſumption, and it is far from being intended,
to draw any parallels or inferences from the campaigns of 1759 and 1777, except
ſuch as merely apply to conſumption of time under ſimilar
circumſtances. In other points the pretenſions of the reſpective Generals
may be as different as their fortunes; or, to make a much clearer
diſtinction, and a yet ſtronger contraſt, as wide aſunder as the
auſpices under which they ſerved, thoſe of Mr. Pitt and of Lord George
Germain.</p>

defence. The Britiſh bayonet was repeatedly tried ineffectually. Eleven
hundred Britiſh ſoldiers, foiled in theſe trials, bore inceſſant fire
from a ſucceſſion of freſh troops in ſuperior numbers, for above four
hours; and after a loſs of above a third of their numbers (and in one of the
regiments above two thirds) forced the enemy at laſt. Of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of a
captain and forty-eight artillery men, the captain and thirty-ſix were killed
or wounded. Theſe facts are marked by a concurrence of evidence that no man
will diſpute. The tribute of praiſe due to ſuch troops will not be

a juſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſhame to thoſe who have dared to depreciate or fully
valour ſo conſpicuous—who have their ears open only to the prejudice
of American cowardice; and having been always loud upon that courtly topic,
ſtifle the glory of their countrymen to maintain a baſe
conſiſtency.</p>
               <p>It will be obſervable from the accounts of the killed and wounded,
that the loſs of officers in all the actions of the campaign was
proportionably much greater than that of the private men: and as this
obſervation applies particularly to the action we are conſidering, it may
not be improper to account for it in this place.</p>

flanks in ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, and were very expert in ſecuring
themſelves, and in ſhifting their ground. In this action, many placed
themſelves in high trees in the rear of their own line, and there was
ſeldom a minute's interval of ſmoke in any part of our line without
officers being taken off by ſingle ſhot.<note n="*" place="bottom">Capt.
Green, aid de camp to Major General Phillips, was ſhot through the arm by one
of theſe markſmen as he was delivering me a meſſage. I learned, after
the convention, from the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer of the riflemen, that the ſhot
was meant for me; and as the captain was ſeen to fall from his horſe, it
was for ſome hours believed in the enemy's army that I was killed. My
eſcape was owing to the captain happening to have a laced furniture to his
ſaddle, which made him miſtaken for the general.</note>

               <p>It will naturally be ſuppoſed, that the Indians would be of
great uſe againſt this mode of fighting. The example of thoſe that
remained after the great deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proved the contrary, for not a man of
them was to be brought within the ſound of a rifle ſhot. The Canadians were
formerly very expert in ſervice of this nature; but beſides the change in
their military character, which I noticed before, their beſt officer was
killed early in the action, which event caſt a general damp upon the corps. A
few of the Provincials were ſerviceable: but the beſt men I had to oppoſe
as markſmen, were the German chaſſeurs, though their number was ſo
ſmall, as not to be one to twenty of the enemy.</p>

croſs-examination upon the proceedings of the army after this action will
ſhew the folly there would be in bringing a military cauſe to a
parliamentary enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, upon the preſumption that any parts of it would be
left unexamined. The very want of practical knowledge in the enquirers renders
them more inquiſitive, and much more tenacious of doubts and ſurmiſes,
than they would otherwiſe be: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; I do not believe that with an
army exhauſted by a long and ſevere action, and deprived of an uncommon
portion of officers, the queſtion of attacking the enemy next morning would
have occurred to any man of profeſſional judgment: that enemy too in a
poſition of which no further knowledge could be obtained than that it was
covered by an intrenchment and abattis, and the approach to be made through a
thick wood, without any avenue cut, or a ſingle poſt fortified to ſecure
a retreat, or to cover the magazine, which afforded the only poſſible means
of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Equally remote would be the thoughts of military men from attacking
a few days after, when it appeared I had received a letter from Sir Henry
Clinton, informing me of a diverſion ſo powerful as an attack upon Fort
Montgomery to be undertaken as at that very time.</p>
               <p>The queſtions relating to the enemy having their baggage packed,
if that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was meant as an indication that they meant to retreat,
is another proof how <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0652302600:129"/> little the queſtioners knew of
ſervice. It does not appear in evidence how the fact was: but no officer will
diſpute, that if the enemy had not only packed their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, but actually
conveyed it to the other ſide the river, they would have acted conformably to
the general practice of ſervice when action is expected; and to no
circumſtance of ſervice more than to that when it is reſolved to
diſpute a poſt to the laſt extremity.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole of my ſituation at that time, I am ſo confident
that it was the part of an officer to fortify and wait events, that I am only
further intent to prove that I fortified properly, the nature of the ground and
my ſeveral purpoſes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Upon this principle I ſubmit the plan
annexed.<note place="margin">Plan No. V.</note> It will alſo ſhew the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
of the ground between the two armies, and ſerve to explain the difficulties
the witneſſes expreſs of taking a view of the enemy's left: but it will
be conſidered, that beſides theſe apparent obſtacles to a near
approach, the enemy abounded in militia, which ſupplied out-poſts and
ſcouts, that could by no means be driven in without making the army liable to
a general action.</p>
               <p>As for any other intelligence than what could be obtained by
eye-ſight it was generally contradictory, always imperfect; the deſerters
were often ſuſpicious, the priſoners very few. I never ſaw any
inſtance of ſervice where it was ſo difficult to obtain information.
Among people ſpeaking the ſame language with ourſelves, and many of them
profeſſing the moſt favourable diſpoſitions, ſcarcely any could be
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon, by rewards or principle, to riſk his perſon for the
purpoſe of intelligence.</p>
               <p>In regard to the croſs-examination, reſpecting the time
neceſſary for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the redoubts and other works, I
neither thought it worth while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it at the time, nor ſhall I
conteſt it now, though nothing would be more eaſy than to ſhew that there
was a great deal of neceſſary labour which the queſtions did not lead to,
and conſequently the witneſſes could not with propriety enter into the
explanation of them. But what makes the conſumption of time to me imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
is, that I place my juſtification upon the expediency of waiting the
co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Sir Henry Clinton. It is in proof, that I received a letter
from him the day after the action of the 19th,<note n="*" place="bottom">The
original letter is in my poſſeſſion, but could not be produced without
diſcovering a ſecret mode of conveying intelligence that it might be
improper to make public.</note> informing me that he meditated an attack upon
Fort Montgomery as at that very time. And as I have already ſaid, that I
ſhould have thought it the part of madneſs to have riſked an attack upon
the enemy, in the weak ſtate of my army, for ſome time after the late
action, and under the expectation of ſo powerful a diverſion; ſo ſhould
I have deferred it longer, even after being recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the hoſpital, on
account of the ſame expectation, and the further chance of the reinforcement
of Colonel St. Leger's corps, and perhaps a convoy of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0652302600:130"/> from Ticonderoga: ſo far am I from conceiving the
paſt delay blameable, that I acknowledge the meaſure of the 7th of October
was precipitated by ſome days, by the forage being become ſo ſcarce, that
a ſupply could only be obtained by a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the army.</p>

the inactive ſtate of the army at this period was a ſtate of reſt, they
are as much miſtaken as they would be if they ſuppoſed it in any other

the armies were ſo near, that not a night paſſed without firing, and
ſometimes concerted attacks upon our advanced picquets; no foraging party
could be made without great detachments to cover it; it was the plan of the
enemy to harraſs the army by conſtant alarms, and their ſuperiority of
numbers enabled them to attempt it without fatigue to themſelves.</p>
               <p>By being habituated to fire, our ſoldiers became indifferent to
it, and were capable of eating or ſleeping when it was very near them: but I
do not believe either officer or ſoldier ever ſlept during that interval
without his cloaths, or that any general officer, or commander of a regiment,
paſſed a ſingle night without being upon his legs occaſionally at
different hours, and conſtantly an hour before day-light.</p>

his laſt—and with the kindeſt expreſſions of his affection, his

of the 8th of October was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to this inauſpicious beginning.
The hours were meaſured by a ſucceſſion of immediate cares,
encreaſing doubts, and melancholy objects. The enemy were formed in two
lines. 
<note place="margin">Lord Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington, 67, &amp;c.</note>Every part of
their diſpoſition, as well as the repeated attacks upon Lord Balcarras's

expectation of a general action. During this ſuſpenſe, wounded officers,
ſome upon crutches, and others even carried upon hand-barrows by their
ſervants, were occaſionally aſcending the hill from the hoſpital tents,
to take their ſhare in the action, or follow the march of the army. The
generals were employed in exhorting the troops.</p>

defeated army was to retreat from an enemy fluſhed with ſucceſs, much
ſuperior in front, and occupying ſtrong poſts in the country behind. We
were equally liable upon that march to be attacked in front, in flank, or rear.
The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of march had been concerted as much as circumſtances
would admit; and it was executed by the officers and the troops in general with
a preciſion that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in critical ſituations can only teach. The
baggage, which could only move in one column, and in a narrow road, fell into
the confuſion which it is impoſſible for caution to guard againſt in

even the ſtupidity or drunkenneſs of a driver, may ſtop and often

               <p>Beſides the continuation of difficulties and general fatigue, this

beg leave to obſerve beſides, that it has direct reference to my ſubject,
to ſhew what the luxuries were with which (as the world has been taught to
believe) the army was encumbered; what were the accommodations prepared for the
<hi>two thouſand women</hi> that are gravely ſuppoſed, in the croſs
examination, to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the baggage. An idea ſo prepoſterous,
as well as falſe, would have been a fitter ſubject for deriſion than
refutation, but that it was maliciouſly intended; not, I am confident, by the
member who aſked the queſtions, but by the perſons who impoſed upon
him, to effect by prejudice what they deſpaired of effecting by

               <p>I ſhall however conſider part of this ſtory as ſo far
unconnected with the immediate buſineſs I was upon (purſuing the line of
evidence upon the retreat to Saratoga) as to give it in the margin. It may well
ſtand by itſelf; and I venture to think that this one example of patience,
ſuffering, and fortitude, will be permitted to paſs without cenſure or
obloquy.<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>Lady Harriet Ackland had accompanied her huſband to Canada in
the beginning of the year 1776. In the courſe of that campaign ſhe had
traverſed a vaſt ſpace of country, in different extremities of
ſeaſon, and with difficulties that an European traveller will not eaſily
conceive, to attend, in a poor hut at Chamblée, upon his ſick bed.</p>

                     <p>In the opening of the campaign of 1777 ſhe was reſtrained
from offering herſelf to a ſhare of the fatigue and hazard expected before
Ticonderoga, by the poſitive injunctions of her huſband. The day after the
conqueſt of that place, he was badly wounded, and ſhe croſſed the Lake
Champlain to join him.</p> 
                     <p>As ſoon as he recovered, Lady Harriet proceeded to follow his
fortunes through the campaign, and at Fort Edward, or at the next camp, ſhe
acquired a two-wheel tumbril, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the artificers
of the artillery, ſomething ſimilar to the carriage uſed for the mail
upon the great roads of England. Major Ackland commanded the Britiſh
grenadiers, which were attached to General Fraſer's corps; and conſequently
were always the moſt advanced poſt of the army. Their ſituations were
often ſo alert, that no perſon ſlept out of their cloaths. In one of
theſe ſituations a tent, in which the major and Lady Harriet were aſleep,
ſuddenly took fire. An orderly ſerjeant of grenadiers, with great hazard of
ſuffocation, dragged out the firſt perſon he caught hold of. It proved to
be the major. It happened, that in the ſame inſtant ſhe had, unknowing
what ſhe did, and perhaps not perfectly awake, providentially made her
eſcape, by creeping under the walls of the back part of the tent. The firſt
object ſhe ſaw, upon the recovery of her ſenſes, was the major on the
other ſide, and in the ſame inſtant again in the fire, in ſearch of
her. The ſerjeant again ſaved him, but not without the major being very
ſeverely burned in his face and different parts of the body. Every thing they
had with them in the tent was conſumed.</p> 
                     <p>This accident happened a little time before the army paſſed
the Hudſon's River. It neither altered the reſolution nor the
chearfulneſs of Lady Harriet; and ſhe continued her progreſs, a partaker
of the fatigues of the advanced corps. The next call upon her fortitude was of
a different nature, and more diſtreſsful, as of longer ſuſpenſe. On
the march of the 19th, the grenadiers being liable to action at every ſtep,
ſhe had been directed by the major to follow the route of the artillery and
bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, which was not expoſed. At the time the action began ſhe found
herſelf near a ſmall uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited hut, where ſhe alighted. When it was
found the action was becoming general and bloody, the ſurgeons of the
hoſpital took poſſeſſion of the ſame place, as the moſt
convenient for the firſt care of the wounded. Thus was this lady in hearing
of one continued fire of cannon and muſketry, for four hours together, with
the preſumption, from the poſt of her huſband at the head of the
grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that he was in the moſt expoſed part of the action. She had
three female companions, the Baroneſs of Reideſel and the wives of two
Britiſh officers, Major Harnage and Lieutenant Reynell; but in the event
their preſence ſerved but little for comfort. Major Harnage was ſoon
brought to the ſurgeons, very badly wounded; and a little time after came
intelligence that Lieutenant Reynell was ſhot dead. Imagination will want no
helps to figure the ſtate of the whole groupe.</p> 
                     <p>From the date of that action to the 7th of October, Lady
Harriet, with her uſual ſerenity, ſtood prepared for new trials! and it
was her lot that their ſeverity encreaſed with their numbers. She was again
expoſed to the hearing of the whole action, and at laſt received the
ſhock of her individual misfortune, mixed with the intelligence of the
general calamity, the troops were defeated, and Major Ackland, deſperately
wounded, was a priſoner.</p> 
                     <p>The day of the 8th was paſſed by Lady Harriet and her
companions in common anxiety, not a tent, nor a ſhed being ſtanding, except
what belonged to the Hoſpital, their refuge was among the wounded and the
dying.</p>

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0652302600:134"/> When the army was upon the point of moving
after the halt deſcribed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a meſſage from Lady Harriet,
ſubmitting to my deciſion a propoſal (and expreſſing an earneſt
ſolicitude to execute it, if not interfering with my deſigns) of
paſſing to the camp of the enemy, and requeſting General Gates's
permiſſion to attend her huſband.</p>
               <p>Though I was ready to believe (for I had experienced) that patience
and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in a ſupreme degree, were to be found, as well as every other
virtue, under the moſt tender forms, I was aſtoniſhed at this propoſal.
After ſo long an agitation of the ſpirits, exhauſted not only for want of
reſt, but abſolutely want of food, drenched in rains for twelve hours
together, that a woman ſhould be capable of ſuch an undertaking as
delivering herſelf to the enemy, probably in the night, and uncertain of what
hands ſhe might firſt fall into, appeared an effort above human nature. The
aſſiſtance I was enabled to give was ſmall indeed; I had not even a cup
of wine to offer her; but I was told ſhe had found, from ſome kind and
fortunate hand, a little rum and dirty water. All I could furniſh to her was
an open boat and a few lines, written upon dirty and wet paper, to General
Gates, recommending her to his protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0652302600:135"/> Mr. Brudenell, the chaplain to the artillery
(the ſame gentleman who had offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated ſo ſignally at General Fraſer's
funeral) readily undertook to accompany her, and with one female ſervant, and
the major's valet-de-chambre (who had a ball which he had received in the late
action then in his ſhoulder) ſhe rowed down the river to meet the enemy.
But her diſtreſſes were not yet to end. The night was advanced before the
boat reached the enemy's out-poſts, and the centinel would not let it paſs,
nor even come on ſhore. In vain Mr. Brudenell offered the flag of truce, and
repreſented the ſtate of the extraordinary paſſenger. The guard,
apprehenſive of treachery, and punctilious to their orders, threatened to
fire into the boat if it ſtirred before day light. Her anxiety and
ſuffering were thus protracted through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight dark and cold hours;
and her reflections upon that firſt reception could not give her very
encouraging ideas of the treatment ſhe was afterwards to expect. But it is
due to juſtice at the cloſe of this adventure to ſay, that ſhe was
received and accommodated by General Gates with all the humanity and reſpect
that her rank, her merits and her fortunes deſerved.</p>
               <p>Let ſuch as are affected by theſe circumſtances of alarm,
hardſhip and danger, recollect, that the ſubject of them was a woman; of
the moſt tender and delicate frame; of the gentleſt manners; habituated to
all the ſoft elegancies, and refined enjoyments, that attend high birth and
fortune; and far advanced in a ſtate in which the tender cares, always due to
the ſex, become indiſpenſibly neceſſary. Her mind alone was formed
for ſuch trials.</p>

reach of grape-ſhot, a croſs fire from the artillery and muſketry of the
intrenched corps upon the hill, and the muſketry of the 20th regiment, which
was at eaſy diſtance to be ſupported by the Germans, in front; added to
this would have been the advantage, which though always wiſhed for we never
had attained, of a charge upon an open plain. I am perſuaded the general
judgment will go with me when I lament the accident that prevented the enemy's

                  <note place="margin">Reflections upon the convention.</note>A fair
judgment upon recent events is hardly to be expected, eſpecially while many
prejudices are alive. It will be allowed me to aſſume, what no one has ever
ventured to deny, that there may be a combination of circumſtances under
which an army may be juſtified in treating with an enemy. That the army under
my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was under ſuch circumſtances at Saratoga is alſo generally
acknowledged: but what is not denied to me from my own ſituation, is
attempted to be withheld, by ſome, on account of the quality of the enemy.
They ſuggeſt that there ſhould be no treaty with rebels. It is
unneceſſary in anſwer to have recourſe to hiſtory. I will not take
defence from treaties between Spain, the haughtieſt power of the world, and
the arch-rebel the great Prince of Orange; nor between Charles the Firſt and
the arch-rebels the Engliſh Parliament (for ſuch in both inſtances they
were called) I need only refer to the examples exiſting at that time in
America, <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0652302600:138"/> and ſince much improved on at home. My
ſuperior officer in America, with the approbation of government, had treated
upon different occaſions with General Waſhington. The Britiſh government
in its higheſt collective authority, the King in Parliament, has ſince
commiſſioned five members of that Parliament, the one a peer, the others of
eminent ſtation in military and civil capacities, to <hi>treat with</hi>
rebels, I had almoſt ſaid to <hi>ſue</hi> to rebels for peace, by the
ſurrender of almoſt every principle for the maintenance of which they had
proſecuted the war.</p>
               <p>Thus highly juſtified in treating with rebels, I am at a loſs to
diſcover by what poſſible mode of defence I could have acquitted myſelf
to God or my country, when the brave and intelligent officers of my army
unanimouſly reſolved, upon military principle, precedent and reaſon, that
the treaty was expedient, and the terms honourable, if I had delivered them up
to certain deſtruction, or even to be priſoners at diſcretion.</p>
               <p>If the informed and diſpaſſionate part of mankind ſhould
agree in ſentiment with the unanimous voice of the army, upon the convention
of Saratoga, ſurely to impute to it the final loſs of the army is too
palpable an injuſtice long to remain upon the minds of the moſt prejudiced.
The convention expreſsly preſerved the army for the ſervice of the
ſtate. According to that convention a truce was made during the war, between
that army and the enemy, in America, and it now might have been acting
againſt the Houſe of Bourbon in any other part of the world. The army was
loſt by the non-compliance with the treaty on the part of the Congreſs; and
that violation of faith no man will ever be found to juſtify.</p>
               <p>I will not decide how far it was encouraged in America, by the
perſuaſion that the miniſtry of Britain had neither power nor ſpirit to
redreſs the wrong; and that they had ſunk the nation ſo low, in point of
reſpect, that the world would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look, where ſhe was concerned, an action
that would have excited, in any other caſe, univerſal cenſure and
indignation. But whatever motives the Congreſs may have had, the tameneſs
and ſilence with which the Britiſh miniſters have borne this outrage, is
aſtoniſhing. That men ſo conſtant and ſo prodigal in their anger
againſt the Congreſs, as never before to have failed in expreſſing it,
even in caſes where it bordered upon being ridiculous, ſhould on a ſudden
become cold and mute, and dead to feeling, in a caſe where reſentment was
juſtly founded, can hardly be accounted for, except upon the principle that
it was better to ſuppreſs the juſteſt cenſure upon a power they
deteſted, than that even a particle of unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited odium ſhould be wanting
to load the man whom they were reſolved to depreſs.</p>

            <p>I AM not aware that in the preceding Review of Evidence I have
neglected any part eſſential to my defence. I do not reckon as ſuch, that
part which applies to the management of the public purſe. The calumny
deſigned to wound me upon that head was too groſs to ſucceed: it
periſhed in its birth, and ſcorn is the only ſentiment excited by the
remembrance of its momentary exiſtence. In regard to the more plauſible
objections pointed againſt my conduct, I have not only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to meet
them in the croſs-examination, but have ſearched for them in every place
where I could ſuppoſe them to originate or be entertained. If ſome have
eſcaped, I ſhall ſtand excuſed, when it is recollected how they have
grown and changed from one ſhape to another, and that it has never been my
fortune to be confronted with an avowed and regular accuſer—I deſpair
of ever being ſo: but I deſire it to be underſtood, that although I am
earneſt in this mode of defence, I am ſo far from declining another, that I
ſhall think it one very happy circumſtance of the paſt enquiry, if any
thing contained in it ſhould have effect hereafter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an enquiry by
court-martial.</p>
            <p>It would not be an ungrateful taſk to follow the defence of the
campaign with a detail of the occurrences which happened between the time of
ſigning the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and my leaving America. Many of them would be found
curious; and the cares and perplexities in which I bore a principal and moſt
painful part, would create a new intereſt in the minds of my friends: but I
do not think myſelf at liberty, upon the plan I laid down at my outſet, to
enter into matter where no blame is imputed or implied. If my proceedings
during that interval deſerve any credit, I am content with that teſtimony
of it, which I may aſſume from the ſilence of my enemies.</p>

            <p>Immediately after my arrival, a board of general officers was

might be parties were abſent; but it was evidently the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of
the houſe, that an enquiry ſhould be inſtituted the enſuing
ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>I pledged myſelf zealouſly to proſecute that meaſure; I
accuſed miniſters of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious treatment towards myſelf; and it became
my duty, upon occaſions with which my own affairs had no connection, to
expreſs deeper reſentments of their conduct towards the public.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of things parliament was prorogued on the 3<hi>d of
June.</hi> On the 5<hi>th of June,</hi> I received the firſt order to repair
to Boſton as ſoon as I had tried the Bath waters. The order and my
anſwer, repreſenting the hardſhip of being ſent back unheard, and the
ſecond conditional order, with entire ſlight of my repreſentations, are
too well known to require repetition: but there are two circumſtances
attending the dates of theſe orders with which I was not acquainted till long
after, and which have never yet been taken notice of.</p>
            <p>The one is, that at the very time I was told that my preſence was
<hi>material,</hi> and (as the ſecond letter from the ſecretary at war
expreſſed) of <hi>ſo much importance to the troops detained priſoners
in New England,</hi> that it muſt not be diſpenſed with—at that
very time, it was determined to ratify the convention, according to the
requiſition of the Congreſs; and to tranſmit the ratification through
other hands, and without any participation with me, or employment of me, in
carrying it to a concluſion. It was very poſſible, the troops might have
been ſailed for England before I had reached America, had I even complied as
early as the condition of either order could poſſibly be conſtrued to
preſcribe. But at all events, the circumſtance could not but ſerve to
mark <hi>to me</hi> the true intent and meaning of the order beyond a
poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of miſtake—<hi>that it was an order of vindictive
puniſhment;</hi> and my preſence with the troops, if I reached America in
time, was <hi>material</hi> and <hi>important</hi> to mark to <hi>them</hi> the
degree of diſgrace to which I was reduced. The terms are a mockery, and an
inſult upon common ſenſe, if applied, in the ſituation in which I was
placed, to the ſervice of the King, or the conſolation of the troops. Such
a diſplay of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance might indeed be intended to apply to their prudence,
and to act as a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and warning how at their return they ſhould
ſupport a General under the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the King's diſpleaſure.<note n="*" place="bottom">In times when the maintenance of the conſtitution in its
purity is the ruling principle of an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, the King's name is
introduced by office only to denote an act of the executive part of the
ſtate. In times when an adminiſtration mean to rule by the influence of
monarchy, the language of office is to connect the royal perſon with the act,
and to give him attributes of paſſion and diſpleaſure, from which in
his political character he is held exempt. I diſclaim language and ideas ſo
unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and diſreſpectful, and never mean to allude to my
Sovereign perſonally, but in acts of juſtice and mercy.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The other circumſtance attending theſe dates is not leſs
remarkable, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0652302600:141"/> The determination of changing the nature of the
war, as afterwards declared by the commiſſioners in America, muſt have
been taken at this time.</p>
            <p>I am very much diſinclined to believe, that the conſideration of
my perſon as a proper victim upon that occaſion was ever regularly and
formally debated in the cabinet: but I cannot think it uncharitable to the
individual adviſer of the Crown, whoever he was, who could project ſuch an
order, to ſuppoſe, that if upon the firſt exerciſe of <hi>the extremes
of war</hi> on the one ſide, and in the ardour of retaliation on the other,
it had ſo happened, that an object ſo well to be ſpared as an obnoxious
and diſgraced Lieutenant General, had opportunely preſented itſelf to the
enemy's rigour, and had been detained in their priſons, the order for the
voyage would not have been thought, by that individual, quite thrown away.
Detention, with or without the troops, of a troubleſome and bold complainant,
could not be immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial or unimportant to ſuch a perſon, and the order was
of an import

            <p>The living preſence of an injured man is, perhaps, more offenſive
and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to the ſight of a mean injurer, that the ſpectre of
him would be after death.</p>
            <p>But to return to the facts I was recapitulating.</p>
            <p>I remained under the conditional order in England.</p>
            <p>The enſuing ſeſſion, the parliamentary enquiry now laid before
the public took place. It ended, as has been ſtated, in July, 1779.</p>
            <p>In September, I received a ſevere reprimand, a denial of a
court-martial, and a prohibition of ſerving my country in its exigence,
though other officers preciſely in my ſituation were employed—I
reſigned.</p>
            <p>The blame laid upon me for the part I took in theſe tranſactions
is, that intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately and factiouſly I engaged in oppoſition; that I was
guilty of diſobedience to the King's orders; and it has been added in a late
publication, that even my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of my conduct is a libel upon the King's
government.</p>
            <p>I think I have perceived, that the firſt part of theſe charges, a
raſh engagement in oppoſition, is not combated by ſome who wiſh me well
ſo ſtrenuouſly as other imputations have been. It may poſſibly have
appeared to friendly and prudential obſervers, as a palliating plea for a
reſtitution to favour upon ſome future occaſion, to have to ſay, that I
had acted upon the ſudden impulſe of paſſion; and the ſequel might
be, that I had repented, and would offend no more.</p>
            <p>Without doubting the kindneſs which ſuggeſts theſe excuſes,
I have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by principles too forcible, and have taken my part too
decidedly, to look for a reſource in thoſe or any other ſubterfuges. It
would be inconſiſtent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable in me to withhold a public
declaration upon this occaſion, in addition <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0652302600:142"/> to thoſe
I have made upon others, that I engaged in reſiſtance to the meaſures of
the court upon mature reflection; that after collecting in my mind all the
lights upon men and things which my experience and obſervation could
furniſh, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the conſtitution of England was betrayed: and
neither blaming or ſuſpecting any men who conceived different opinions, and
acted upon them, I thought it a point of time in which a man believing as I did
was called upon to ſacrifice to his country. The teſt of this motive, it is
true, muſt reſt between God and my conſcience: but let it not be
ſuppoſed that I acted blindly—the path of intereſt, a broad and
beaten track, lay clearly before me from the time I arrived in England. Supple
joints, and an attentive eye, always giving way to power, on one ſide, and
ſometimes puſhing my friends into the dirt on the other, would have carried
me ſafely through. I even believe, that the adviſer of the letters I lately
alluded to would rather have ſeen me in that track, than in the other which
he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for me acroſs the Atlantic.</p>
            <p>As little would I be ſuppoſed to want diſcernment of the path I
took: for the barefaced preferences, rewards and puniſhments held forth for
parliamentary conduct, were among the moſt glaring parts of the ſyſtem I
had contemplated. And it was impoſſible to doubt, that as a delinquent
<hi>there,</hi> I ſhould be preſſed both by art and vengeance to the end
the enemies I had provoked foreſaw—the loſs of my profeſſion and
the impoveriſhment of my fortune. I truſt it will be an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent revenge
on my part, to ſhew them I can bear my condition firmly; and that I am
incapable of redeeming what I have loſt, were it ever in my option, by the
diſavowal of a ſingle principle I have profeſſed.</p>
            <p>I come now to the ſecond charge, diſobedience of orders; and in a
point that ſo nearly touches the very eſſence of military character, I
truſt I ſhall not treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs upon the patience of the reader, if I treat
it a little more at large than I have done in my correſpondence with the
ſecretary at war.</p>
            <p>I admit that ſubordination and implicit obedience, as applied to the
operation of arms, are primary principles in the military ſyſtem. An army
is a mere name without them. The officer who heſitates to meet certain death
upon command, deſerves to receive it from the hand of the executioner.</p>
            <p>But there are poſſible exceptions to theſe general principles,
eſpecially out of the field, in the moſt abſolute ſervices; and in the
Britiſh ſervice they are known and marked, and co-exiſtent with the
military eſtabliſhment itſelf, in the mutiny act, which confines
obedience to legal commands. An army muſt again be garbled like the army of
Cromwell (which God avert!) before an order could be executed, like that of
Cromwell, for garbling the parliament.</p>
            <p>A high ſpirit will contract the limits of obedience ſtill more;
with illegal, he will reject diſhonourable commands; and he will follow the
reaſoning I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready premiſed, and ſtate it as a maxim thus: <hi>he
who obeys at the expence of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> 
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0652302600:143"/> 
               <hi>comfort,
health and life, is a ſoldier; he who obeys at the expence of honour is a
ſlave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I may be aſked by ſome diſciplinarians, who is to be the
judge in theſe nice definitions of obedience? It is uncommon military
doctrine, I may be told, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon the King's orders—I confeſs
it is ſo. Since the reign of James the Second, in the Britiſh ſervice it
never has been neceſſary. We have been uſed in this age, to ſee the
King's name give wings and inſpiration to duty. Diſcipline, in this
country, has been raiſed upon perſonal honour—a firmer baſis than
fear or ſervility ever furniſhed: and the miniſter who firſt ſhakes
that happy confidence; who turns military command to political craft; who dares
to uſe his gracious Sovereign's name as an engine of ſtate, to glut his own
anger, or to remove his own fears, he is amongſt the worſt enemies to that
Sovereign. But ſhould his purpoſes go further (a conſideration of far
greater magnitude to the public) and ſhould it be ſeen that the royal name
was brought forth for the <hi>diſcipline</hi> of parliament, the miniſter
ſo uſing it would be not only an enemy to his Sovereign, but a traitor to
the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>I will cloſe the defence of my principles reſpecting military
ſubordination by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to an anecdote well authenticated and not very
remote.</p>
            <p>An officer in a neighbouring nation, for ſome error he had committed
in a day of battle, received a blow from his prince who commanded in perſon.
The officer drew a piſtol, and his firſt movement was to point it at his
maſter; but the next (and it was inſtantaneous) was to turn the muzzle, and
diſcharge the ball into his own heart. Though my caſe differs both in the
provocation and the conſequence, in many circumſtances my conduct may
juſtly be ſupported upon the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I receive an affront that a
liberal ſpirit cannot endure; and in a name, againſt which no perſonal
reſentment can be purſued, nor indeed entertained: but a ſuicide of my
profeſſional exiſtence (if I may be allowed the phraſe) is preferable
to the ſtate in which the affront placed me. In one inſtance only I
renounce the parallel—God forbid I ſhould be thought, even in a burſt
of paſſion, to have pointed at my Sovereign! It was not from his hand I
received the blow.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſolicit the reader's attention very little further: but I
feel the neceſſity of repeating my application to the candour of the
public, both as a writer and an appellant. Defence, and imputation of blame to
others, are naturally interwoven in my cauſe: it required a more diſtinct
conception, and an abler hand than mine, to keep them always apart, and open to
ſeparate view. In ſome parts my defence may be weakened by this deficiency
of ſkill: but I have no right to offer the ſame excuſe for ſuffering
any blame to reſt upon others beyond what I thought myſelf juſtified to
ſupport.</p>
            <p>Upon this principle, I think it juſt, at taking leave of the
ſecretary of ſtate for the American department, briefly to enumerate the
only facts and propoſitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0652302600:144"/> the plan of
the expedition from Canada, that I think clearly maintainable againſt
him.</p>
            <p>Firſt fact. It is clear that the plan of a junction of the greater
part of the forces in Canada with the army of Sir William Howe, was formed in
the year 1776, when Sir William Howe was in full ſucceſs; when his whole
force was in the neighbourhood of New York, or in the Jerſies, and Mr.
Waſhington was beaten, and at the weakeſt.</p>
            <p>Second fact. This plan of a junction was continued (and upon juſt
reaſoning) in the cloſe of the year 1776, when Sir William Howe's firſt
propoſal of operations for the enſuing campaign arrived. Thoſe
propoſals were made upon the datum of a number of troops, ſufficient to
furniſh, beſides the main army, an <hi>offenſive</hi> army of 10,000 men,
rank and file, to act on the ſide of Rhode Iſland, by taking
poſſeſſion of Providence, and penetrating from thence into the country
towards Boſton; and another <hi>offenſive</hi> army, not leſs than
10,000, to move up the North River to Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, excluſive of 5000 for the
defence of New York.</p>
            <p>In either of the above caſes, the plan of junction could hardly have
failed of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Third fact. On the 23d of February, Sir William Howe's alteration of
the firſt plan was received, and he then propoſed to act with the greater
part of his force on the ſide of Philadelphia, at the opening of the
campaign, and to enable him ſo to do, to defer the <hi>offenſive plan from
Rhode Iſland till the reinforcements ſhould arrive,</hi> and to deſtine
only 3000 men to act <hi>defenſively</hi> upon the lower part of the
Hudſon's River.</p>
            <p>Fourth fact. On the 3d of March, the ſecretary of ſtate
ſignified his Majeſty's entire approbation of this deviation from the plan
firſt ſuggeſted.</p>
            <p>From theſe facts ariſes my firſt propoſition, that at the time
the change of plan for Sir William Howe's operations was adopted, by which no
offenſive force was to remain upon the Hudſon's River, nor a diverſion
probably to take place from Rhode Iſland, the plan of my operations, the
ſucceſs of which would probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend in a great degree upon co-operation
and diverſion, ought to have been changed likewiſe: inſtead of that, it
was enforced and made poſitive by the refuſal of the latitude I had
propoſed of acting upon the Connecticut, or, in caſe of exigency, embarking
the troops and effecting the junction by ſea.</p>
            <p>Fifth fact. On the 19th of March, a letter from Sir William Howe, by
the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of ſtate, acquainting him, that a brigade of Britiſh and
ſome companies of bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadiers and light infantry had been withdrawn from
Rhode Iſland, which made the force left there merely defenſive. The ſame
letter mentions the proſpects the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had of bringing 50,000 men into the
field.</p>
            <p>Sixth fact. I did not leave England till the beginning of April, by
which time the ſecretary of ſtate muſt have known, or ought to have
known, that no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance could be placed upon reinforcements from England
arriving at New York in time for Sir William Howe to reſume the intention he
had deferred, viz. a diverſion <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0652302600:145"/> from Rhode Iſland, or
of making the force upon the Hudſon's River adequate to offenſive
operation.</p>
            <p>Hence ariſes my ſecond propoſition, that the latitude I had
propoſed, or other expedients of precaution, ought then at leaſt to have
been adopted: inſtead of which, I was ſuffered to ſail, ignorant of Sir
William Howe's plans, and ignorant of the defalcation or the delays in the
reinforcements deſtined for him. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence was, that neither his
letter to Sir Guy Carleton, put into my hands after my arrival in Canada, nor
his letter to me of the 17th of June, informing me of his deſtination for
Penſylvania, removed my expectation of co-operation, becauſe I was to
ſuppoſe, that ſubſequent to the dates of either of thoſe letters, he
would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive orders from the ſecretary of ſtate reſpecting the
junction, and alſo a timely reinforcement.</p>
            <p>Seventh fact. The ſecretary of ſtate makes no mention of the
northern expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any of his diſpatches to Sir William Howe at the end
of March, when my orders were fixed, nor in the month of April. And it is a
further fact, that I am perſuaded will not be conteſted, that he did not
mention any orders or recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relative to co-operation verbally to Sir
William Howe's aid-de-camp, or any other confidential perſon who ſailed
about that time.</p>
            <p>The firſt mention made of the neceſſity of co-operation was in
the ſecretary of ſtate's letter of the 18<hi>th of May,</hi> wherein his
Lordſhip 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Truſts that whatever he [Sir William Howe] may
meditate, it will be executed in time to co-operate with the army ordered to
proceed from Canada.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>The propoſition clearly juſtified by theſe facts is, that if the
ſecretary of ſtate had thought proper to ſignify the King's expectation
of a co-operation to be made in my favour in the month of March or beginning of
April, as in conſiſtency he ought to have done, it would have arrived
before Sir William Howe embarked his army, and in time for him to have made a
new diſpoſition: but inſtead of that, this very material injunction was
not diſpatched till it was almoſt phyſically impoſſible it ſhould
have any effect. And ſo indeed it happened, for Sir William Howe received it
on the 16th of Auguſt, at a diſtance from Hudſon's River too great for
any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment from his own army to be made in time, could it even have been
ſpared; and the reinforcement from England, upon which Sir William Howe
depended to ſtrengthen Sir Henry Clinton, was much later ſtill—too
late (as it has been ſhewn) to enable that general with all his activity and
zeal to give any effectual ſupport.</p>
            <p>Indeed the conduct of the ſecretary of ſtate, in inſerting this
paragraph, in his letter of the 18th of May, when it could not avail, after
omitting it when certainly it would have been timely, ſeems ſo
prepoſterous, that it can only be explained by one fact. It tranſpired
about that time, that Sir William Howe's a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y was deſtined for Penſylvania, and people who had conſidered
the force of the enemy to be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the northern provinces began to be
alarmed for my army. It is well known <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0652302600:146"/> (though I cannot
aſcertain the date) that an officer of very great ability, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge in the country through which I was to paſs, as ſoon as he heard
no diſpoſition was made for a ſupport from New York, foretold to the
ſecretary of ſtate, or his near friends, the fall of my army. Under this
apprehenſion it might appear to the ſecretary of ſtate a proper caution,
that an expectation of co-operation ſhould exiſt under his hand.</p>
            <p>If plans ſo inconſiſtently formed, and managed by the
ſecretary of ſtate with ſo much ſeeming confidence, as to miſlead his
generals, and ſo much real reſerve as to deſtroy them, ſhould be
defended by that infatuated belief then entertained of the inability of the
enemy to reſiſt, I ſhould beg leave to ſtate, as one propoſition
more, that after the experience of their actions at Trenton, and many other
places, and the intelligence of their new levies received from Sir William
Howe, ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence was an additional fault, and perhaps a more pernicious
one than any I have ſtated.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the noble Lord in his public capacity. What ſhare of
the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution I have ſuſtained (more than I have directly
expreſſed in different parts of my defence) are imputable to his private
councils, is not within my knowledge: but if in ſpeaking of my perſecutors
in general, I may be thought ſometimes to have uſed ſtrong terms, I have
only to ſay, that having advanced no fact which I am not able and reſolved
to maintain, I have not felt myſelf called upon, in applying thoſe facts
for any further attention, than to preſerve the language of a gentleman,
which is an attention due to myſelf as well as to the public. It is open and
manly enmity alone that unites reſpect with reſentment.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I could as eaſily apologiſe for all the other faults with
which this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking abounds as a compoſition. At a time when ſo many
pens are employed, I muſt not expect to be ſpared. I ſhall treat with
ſilent reſpect any comments that are fairly founded and delivered with
liberality; and with contempt, equally ſilent, the common invectives of the
political preſs. This appeal is not to reſt upon li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary criticiſm, or
party diſputation, but upon the broad equity of my country. I know that
prejudice and malice will vaniſh before the man who dares to ſubmit his
actions to that teſt—If acquitted <hi>there,</hi> I feel I am not
degraded; and I have not a ſenſation within my breaſt which does not at
the ſame time aſſure me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unhappy.</p>

                     <p>THE rapid ſucceſs of his Majeſty's arms, in driving the
rebels out of Canada, does great honour to your conduct, and I hope ſoon to
hear that you have been able to purſue them acroſs the lakes, and to
poſſeſs thoſe poſts upon the frontiers which may effectually ſecure
your province from any future inſult.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0652302600:148"/> His Majeſty, in appointing you commander
in chief of his forces in Canada, was pleaſed to extend your commiſſion
to the frontiers of his provinces bordering thereupon, wiſely foreſeeing,
that it might be neceſſary for the compleating your plan of operations,
that you ſhould march your army beyond the limits of your own government. I
truſt, before this letter reaches you, that you will, by your ſpirit and
activity, have cleared the frontiers of Canada of all the rebel forces, and
will have taken the proper meaſures for keeping poſſeſſion of the
lakes. That ſervice being performed, his Majeſty commands me to acquaint
you, that there ſtill remains another part of your duty to be undertaken,
which will require all your abilities and the ſtricteſt application, the
reſtoring peace, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good order and legal government in
Canada. It is an object of the greateſt importance to this country, the
difficulties attending it are immenſe; but his Majeſty depends upon your
zeal, and upon your experience, for carrying it into execution. His Majeſty,
ever anxious for the happineſs of his ſubjects, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to inform you,
that no time ſhould be loſt in beginning ſo important a work, and that
you do therefore return to Quebec, detaching Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, or
ſuch other officer as you ſhall think moſt proper, with that part of your
forces which can be ſpared from the immediate defence of your province, to
carry on ſuch operations as ſhall be moſt conducive to the ſucceſs of
the army acting on the ſide of New-York; and that you direct the officer ſo
detached to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with and put himſelf, as ſoon as poſſible,
under the command of General Howe, you will order ſuch artillery as you
ſhall judge neceſſary to proceed with this detachment; and as a great
quantity of heavy cannon and military ſtores were ſent, upon the
ſuppoſition that Quebec might have been in the hands of the rebels, you
will, upon requiſition from General Howe, ſupply him with ſuch cannon and
ſtores as may not be wanted for the protection of Canada.</p>

               </byline>
               <p>WHEN the laſt ſhips came from Quebec, a report prevailed in
Canada, ſaid to have been founded upon poſitive evidence, that the rebels
had laid the keels of ſeveral large veſſels at Skeneſborough and
Ticonderoga, and were reſolved to exert their utmoſt powers, to conſtruct
a new and formidable fleet during the winter.</p>
               <p>I will not, however, give credit to their exertions, in ſuch a
degree as to imagine the King's troops will be prevented paſſing Lake
Champlain early in the ſummer, but will ſuppoſe the operations of the
army to begin from Crown Point.</p>
               <p>But as the preſent means to form effectual plans is to lay down
every poſſible difficulty, I will ſuppoſe the enemy in great force at
Ticonderoga; the different works there are capable of admitting twelve
thouſand men.</p>
               <p>I will ſuppoſe him alſo to occupy Lake George with a
conſiderable naval ſtrength, in order to ſecure his retreat, and
afterwards to retard the campaign; and it is natural to expect that he will
take meaſures to block up the roads from Ticonderoga to Albany by the way of
Skeneſborough, by fortifying the ſtrong ground at different places, and
thereby obliging the King's army to carry a <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0652302600:149"/> weight of
artillery with it, and by felling trees, breaking bridges, and other obvious
impediments, to delay, though he ſhould not have power or ſpirit finally to
reſiſt, its progreſs.</p>
               <p>The enemy thus diſpoſed upon the ſide of Canada, it is to be
conſidered what troops will be neceſſary, and what diſpoſition of
them will be moſt proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the campaign with vigour and
effect.</p>
               <p>I humbly conceive the operating army (I mean excluſively of the
troops left for the ſecurity of Canada) ought not to conſiſt of leſs
than eight thouſand regulars, rank and file. The artillery required in the
memorandums of General Carleton, a corps of watermen, two thouſand Canadians,
including hatchet-men and other workmen, and one thouſand or more
ſavages.</p>
               <p>It is to be hoped that the reinforcement and the victualllng
ſhips may all be ready to ſail from the Channel and from Corke on the
laſt day of March. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that to ſail with a fleet of
tranſports earlier, is to ſubject government to loſs and
diſappointment. It may reaſonably be expected that they will reach Quebec
before the 20th of May, a period in full time for opening the campaign. The
roads, and the rivers and lakes, by the melting and running off of the ſnows,
are in common years impracticable ſooner.</p>
               <p>But as the weather long before that time will probably have
admitted of labour in the docks, I will take for granted that the fleet of
laſt year, as well bateaux as armed veſſels, will be found repaired,
augmented, and fit for immediate ſervice. The magazines that remain of
proviſion, I believe them not to be abundant, will probably be formed at
Montreal, Sorel and Chamblée.</p>
               <p>I conceive the firſt buſineſs for thoſe entruſted with
the chief powers, ſhould be to ſelect and poſt the troops deſtined to
remain in Canada; to throw up the military ſtores and proviſion with all
poſſible diſpatch, in which ſervice the abovementioned troops, if
properly poſted, will greatly aſſiſt; and to draw the army deſtined
for ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to cantonments, within as few days march of St. John's as
conveniently may be. I ſhould prefer cantonments at that ſeaſon of the
year to encampment, as the ground is very damp, and conſequently very
pernicious to the men, and more eſpecially as they will have been for many
months before uſed to lodgings, heated with ſtoves, or between decks in
ſhips; all theſe operations may be put in motion together, but they
ſeverally require ſome obſervation.</p>
               <p>I ſhould wiſh that the troops left in Canada, ſuppoſing
the number mentioned in my former memorandum to be approved, might be made as
follows.

                  <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0652302600:150"/> My reaſon for ſelecting the 31ſt
regiment for this duty is, that when I ſaw it laſt it was not equally in
order with the other regiments for ſervices of activity.</p>
               <p>I propoſe the 29th regiment as it is not at preſent
brigaded.</p>
               <p>I propoſe Maclean's corps, becauſe I very much apprehend
deſertion from ſuch parts of it as are compoſed of Americans, ſhould
they come near the enemy.</p>
               <p>In Canada, whatſoever may be their diſpoſition, it is not
ſo eaſy to effect it.</p>
               <p>And I propoſe making up the reſidue by detachment, becauſe
by ſelecting the men leaſt calculated for fatigue or leaſt accuſtomed
to it, which may be equally good ſoldiers in more confined movements and
better provided ſituations, the effective ſtrength for operation is much
greater and the defenſive ſtrength not impaired.</p>
               <p>I muſt beg leave to ſtate the expeditious conveyance of
proviſion and ſtores from Quebec, and the ſeveral other depoſitaries,
in order to form ample magazines at Crown Point, as one of the moſt important
operations of the campaign, becauſe it is upon that which moſt of the
reſt will depend. If ſailing veſſels up the St. Lawrence are alone to
be employed, the accident of contrary winds may delay them two months before
they paſs the rapids of Richelieu, and afterwards St. Peter's Lake; delays to
that extent are not uncommon, and they are only to be obviated by having a
quantity of ſmall craft in readineſs to work with oars. From the mouth of
the Sorrel to Chamblée, rowing and tacking is a ſure conveyance if
ſufficient hands are found. From Chamblée to St. Thereſe (which is
juſt above the Rapids) land-carriage muſt be uſed, and great authority
will be requiſite to ſupply the quantity neceſſary.</p>
               <p>A buſineſs thus complicated in arrangement, in ſome parts
unuſual in practice, and in others perhaps difficult, can only be carried to
the deſired effect by the peremptory powers, warm zeal, and conſonant
opinion of the governor; and though the former are not to be doubted, a failure
in the latter, vindicated, or ſeeming to be vindicated, by the plauſible
obſtructions that will not fail to be ſuggeſted by others, will be
ſufficient to cruſh ſuch exertions as an officer of a ſanguine temper,
entruſted with the future conduct of the campaign, and whoſe perſonal
intereſt and fame therefore conſequentially depend upon a timely out-ſet,
would be led to make.</p>
               <p>The aſſembly of the ſavages and the Canadians will alſo
entirely depend upon the governor.</p>
               <p>Under theſe conſiderations, it is preſumed, that the general
officer employed to proceed with the army will be held to be out of the reach
of any poſſible blame till he is clear of the province of Canada, and
furniſhed with the propoſed ſupplies.</p>
               <p>The navigation of Lake Champlain, ſecured by the ſuperiority
of our naval force, and the arrangements for forming proper magazines ſo
eſtabliſhed as to make the execution certain, I would not loſe a day to
take poſſeſſion of Crown Point with Brigadier Fraſer's corps, a large
body of ſavages, a body of Canadians, both for ſcouts and works, and the
beſt of our engineers and artificers well ſupplied with intrenching
tools.</p>
               <p>The brigade would be ſufficient to prevent inſult during the
time neceſſary for collecting the ſtores, forming magazines, and
fortifying the poſts; all which ſhould be done to a certain degree,
previous to proceeding in force to Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga; <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0652302600:151"/> to ſuch
a degree I mean as may be ſuppoſed to be effected in time of
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting artillery, preparing faſcines, and other neceſſaries for
artillery operations; and by keeping the reſt of the army back during that
period, the tranſport of proviſions wil be leſſened, and the ſoldiers
made of uſe in forwarding the convoys.</p>
               <p>But though there would be only one brigade at Crown Point at that
time, it does not follow that the enemy ſhould remain in a ſtate of
tranquility. Corps of ſavages, ſupported by detachments of light regulars,
ſhould be continually on foot to keep them in alarm, and within their works
to cover the reconnoitering of general officers and engineers, and to obtain
the beſt intelligence of their ſtrength, poſition, and deſign.</p>
               <p>If due exertion is made in the preparations ſtated above, it may
be hoped that Ticonderoga will be reduced early in the ſummer, and it will
then become a more proper place for arms than Crown Point.</p>
               <p>The next meaſure muſt depend upon thoſe taken by the enemy,
and upon the general plan of the campaign as concerted at home. If it be
determined that General Howe's whole forces ſhould act upon Hudſon's River,
and to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, and that the only object of the Canada army be
to effect a junction with that force, the immediate poſſeſſion of Lake
George would be of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as the moſt expeditious and moſt
commodious route to Albany; and ſhould the enemy be in force upon that lake,
which is very probable, every effort ſhould be tried, by throwing ſavages
and light troops round it, to oblige them to quit it without waiting for naval
preparations. Should thoſe efforts fail, the route by South Bay and
Skeneſborough might be attempted, but conſiderable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties may be
expected, as the narrow parts of the river may be eaſily choaked up and
rendered impaſſable, and at beſt there will be neceſſity for a great
deal of of land carriage for the artillery, proviſion, &amp;c. which can only
be ſupplied from Canada. In caſe of ſucceſs alſo by that route, and
the enemy not removed from Lake George, it will be neceſſary to leave a
chain of poſts, as the army proceeds, for the ſecurities of your
communication, which may too much weaken ſo ſmall an army.</p>
               <p>Leſt all theſe attempts ſhould unavoidably fail, and it
become indiſpenſibly neceſſary to attack the enemy by water upon Lake
George, the army at the outſet ſhould be provided with carriages,
implements, and artificers, for conveying armed veſſels from Ticonderoga to
the lake.</p>
               <p>Theſe ideas are formed upon the ſuppoſition, that it be the
ſole purpoſe of the Canada army to effect a junction with General Howe, or
after co-operating ſo far as to get poſſeſſion of Albany and open the
communication to New-York, to remain upon the Hudſon's River, and thereby
enable that general to act with his whole force to the ſouthward.</p>
               <p>But ſhould the ſtrength of the main American army be ſuch as
to admit of the corps of troops now at Rhode Iſland remaining there during
the winter, and acting ſeparately in the ſpring, it may be highly worthy
conſideration, whether the moſt important purpoſe to which the Canada
army could be employed, ſuppoſing it in poſſeſſion of Ticonderoga,
would not be to gain the Connecticut River.</p>
               <p>The extent of country from Ticonderoga to the inhabited country
upon that river, oppoſite to Charles Town, is about ſixty miles, and though
to convey artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery and proviſion ſo far by land would be attended with
difficulties, perhaps more <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0652302600:152"/> than thoſe above
ſuggeſted, upon a progreſs to Skeneſborough, ſhould the object appear
worthy, it is to be hoped reſources might be found; in that caſe it would
be adviſeable to fortify with one or two ſtrong redoubts the heights
oppoſite to Charles Town, and eſtabliſh poſts of ſavages upon the
paſſage from Ticonderoga to thoſe heights, to preſerve the
communication, and at the ſame time prevent any attempt from the country
above Charles Town, which is very populous, from moleſting the rear or
interrupting the convoys of ſupply, while the army proceeded down the
Connecticut. Sould the junction between the Canada and Rhode Iſland armies be
effected upon the Connecticut, it is not too ſanguine an expectation that all
the New England provinces will be reduced by their operations.</p>
               <p>To avoid breaking in upon other matter, I omitted in the beginning
of theſe papers to ſtate the idea of an expedition at the outſet of the
campaign by the Lake Ontario and Oſwego to the Mohawk River, which, as a
diverſion to facilitate every propoſed operation, would be highly
deſirable, provided the army ſhould be rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced ſufficiently to afford
it.</p>
               <p>It may at firſt appear, from a view of the preſent ſtrength
of the army, that it may bear the ſort of detachment propoſed by myſelf
laſt year for this purpoſe; but it is to be conſidered that at that time
the utmoſt object of the campaign, from the advanced ſeaſon and
unavoidable delay of preparation for the lakes, being the reduction of Crown
Point and Ticonderoga, unleſs the ſucceſs of my expedition had opened the
road to Albany, no greater numbers were neceſſary than for thoſe firſt
operations. The caſe in the preſent year differs; becauſe the ſeaſon
of the year affording a proſpect of very extenſive operation, and
conſequently the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of many poſts, patroles, &amp;c. will
become neceſſary. The army ought to be in a ſtate of numbers to bear
thoſe drains, and ſtill remain ſufficient to attack any thing that
probably can be oppoſed to it.</p>
               <p>Nor, to argue from probability, is ſo much force neceſſary
for this diverſion this year, as was required for the laſt; becauſe we
then knew that General Schuyler with a thouſand men, was fortified upon the
Mohawk. When the different ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of things are conſidered, viz. the
progreſs of General Howe, the early invaſion from Canada, the threatening
of the Connecticut from Rhode Iſland, &amp;c. it is not to be imagined that
any detachment of ſuch force as that of Schulyer can be ſupplied by the
enemy for the Mohawk. I would not therefore propoſe it of more (and I have
great diffidence whether ſo much can be prudently afforded) than Sir John
Johnſon's corps, an hundred Britiſh from the ſecond brigade, and an
hundred more from the 8th regiment, with four pieces of the lighteſt
artillery, and a body of ſavages; Sir John Johnſon to be with a detachment
in perſon, and an able field officer to command it. I ſhould wiſh
Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger for that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
               <p>I particularize the ſecond brigade, becauſe the firſt is
propoſed to be diminiſhed by the 31ſt regiment remaining in Canada, and
the reſt of the regiment drafted for the expedition being made alſo part of
the Canada force, the two brigades will be exactly ſquared.</p>
               <p>Should it appear, upon examination of the really effective numbers
of the Canada army, that the force is not ſufficient for proceeding upon the
above ideas with a fair proſpect of ſucceſs, the alternative remains of
embarking the army at Quebec, in order to effect a junction with General Howe
by ſea, or to be employed ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0652302600:153"/> rately to
co-operate with the main deſigns, by ſuch means as ſhould be within their
ſtrength upon other parts of the continent. And though the army, upon
examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the numbers from the returns here, and the reinforcements
deſigned, ſhould appear adequate, it is humbly ſubmitted, as a ſecurity
againſt the poſſibility of its remaining inactive, whether it might not
be expedient to entruſt the latitude of embarking the army by ſea to the
commander in chief, provided any accidents du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the winter, and unknown
here, ſhould have diminiſhed the numbers conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, or that the
enemy, from any winter ſucceſs to the ſouthward, ſhould have been able
to draw ſuch forces towards the frontiers of Canada, and take up their ground
with ſuch precaution, as to render the intended meaſure impracticable or
too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous. But in that caſe it muſt be conſidered that more force
would be required to be left behind for the ſecurity of Canada, than is
ſuppoſed to be neceſſary when an army is beyond the lakes; and I do not
conceive any expedition from the ſea can be ſo formidable to the enemy, or
ſo effectual to cloſe the war, as an invaſion from Canada by Ticonderoga.
This laſt meaſure ought not to be thought of, but upon poſitive
conviction of its neceſſity.</p>

                     <p>MY letter of the 22d Auguſt, 1776, was intruſted to the care
of Captain Le Maitre, one of your aid-de-camps; after having been three times

                     <p>With a view of quelling the rebellion as ſoon as poſſible,
it is become highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the moſt ſpeedy junction of the two
armies ſhould be effected; and therefore, as the ſecurity and good
government of Canada abſolutely require your preſence there, it is the
King's determination to leave about 3000 men under your command, for the
defence and duties of that province, and to employ the remainder of your army
upon two expeditions, the one under the command of Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Burgoyne, who is to force his way to Albany, and the other under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger, who is to make a diverſion on the Mohawk
River.</p>
                     <p>As this plan cannot be advantageouſly executed without the
aſſiſtance of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Indians, his Majeſty ſtrongly recommends
it to your care, to furniſh both <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0652302600:154"/> expeditions with
good and ſufficient bodies of thoſe men; and I am happy in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that
your influence among them is ſo great, that there can be no room to
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend you will find it difficult to fulfil his Majeſty's
expectations.</p>
                     <p>In order that no time may be loſt in entering upon theſe
important undertakings, General Burgoyne has received orders to ſail
forthwith for Quebec; and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended operations may be maturely
conſidered, and afterwards carried on in ſuch a manner as is moſt likely
to be followed by ſucceſs, he is directed to conſult with you upon the
ſubject, and to form and adjuſt the plan as you both ſhall think moſt
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to his Majeſty's ſervice.</p>
                     <p>I am alſo to acquaint you, that as ſoon as you ſhall have
fully regulated every thing relative to theſe expeditions (and the King
relies upon your zeal, that you will be as expeditious as the nature of the
buſineſs will admit) it is his Majeſty's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that you detain for

                     <p>You will naturally conclude that this allotment for Canada has
not been made without properly weighing the ſeveral duties which are likely
to be required. His Majeſty has not only conſidered the ſeveral
garriſons and poſts which probably it may be neceſſary for you to take,
<hi>viz.</hi> Quebec, Chaudiére, the diſaffected pariſhes of Point
Levi, Montreal, and poſts between that town and Oſwegatche, Trois Rivieres,
St. John's, Sele aux Noix, La Prairie, Vergere, and ſome other towns upon the
ſouth ſhore of St. Lawrence, oppoſite the iſle of Montreal, with
poſts of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to St. John's, but he hath alſo reflected that the
ſeveral operations which will be carrying on in different parts of America
muſt neceſſarily confine the attention of the rebels to the reſpective
ſcenes of action, and ſecure Canada from external at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, and that the
internal quiet which at preſent prevails is not likely to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, or

                        <p>I TAKE the opportunity of a veſſel diſpatched by Sir Guy
Carleton to England, to inform your Lordſhip of my arrival here the 6th
inſtant. And though my preſent ſituation, as acting under a ſuperior
upon the ſpot, may make an official correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unneceſſary, I
cannot perſuade myſelf I ſhall not appear guilty of impropriety in
aſſuming the honour of a private and confidential one, relatively to the
objects of my deſtination.</p>
                        <p>From my preſent information, I have reaſon to expect the
preparations for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the campaign to be very forward on our part. Due
exertions were uſed in the courſe of the winter, and the uncommon
mildneſs of the weather greatly favoured them, to convey proviſions to
Chamblé and St. John's. One large victualler ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived after I left the
St. Lawrence laſt November; all reſidues of other victuallers have been
collected; I am in hopes of finding a ſufficiency of proviſion to enable me
to croſs the Lake Champlain at leaſt, without the arrival of the Corke
fleet. I hope alſo to find artillery ſtores enough to feel the pulſe of
the enemy at Ticondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga. Should their ſituation and reſolution be ſuch
as to make great artillery prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations requiſite. I ſhall certainly be
under the neceſſity of waiting at Crown Point the arrival of the ordnance
ſhips from England. A good body of the Indians I am aſſured are ready to
move upon the firſt call, and meaſures are taking for bringing them
forthwith to proper redezvous.</p>
                        <p>I cannot ſpeak with ſo much confidence of the military
aſſiſtance I am to look for from the Canadians. The only corps yet
inſtituted, or that I am informed can at preſent be inſtituted, are three
independent companies of 100 men each, officered by Seigneurs of the country,
who are well choſen; but they have not been able to engage many volunteers.
The men are chiefly drafted from the militia, according to a late regulation of
the legiſlative council. Thoſe I have yet ſeen afford no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of
uſe of arms—aukwark, ignorant, diſinclined to the ſervice, and
ſpiritleſs. Various reaſons are aſſigned for this change in the
natives ſince the time of the French government. It may partly be owing to a
diſuſe of arms, but I believe principally to the unpopularity of their
Seigneurs, and to the poiſon which the emiſſaries of the rebels have
thrown into their minds. Should I find the new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies up the country better
compoſed, or that the well affected parties can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to turn
out volunteers, though but for a ſhort occaſion, as they did laſt year, I
ſhall move Sir Guy to exert further meaſures to augment my numbers.</p>
                        <p>The army will fall ſhort of the ſtrength computed in
England; the want of the camp equipage, cloathing, and many other neceſſary
articles, will cauſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience; I am nevertheleſs determined to put
the troops deſtined for my command immediately in motion; and, aſſiſted
by the ſpirit and health in which they abound, I am confident in the
proſpect of overcoming difficulties and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>Having ſettled all meaſures with Sir Guy Carleton, both
for this purpoſe and for the expeditious tranſport of the ſtores as they
may arrive, and having already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched inſtructions to Captain
Lutwidge, who commands the fleet upon Lake <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0652302600:157"/> Champlain, to
ſecure the navigation, in which I clearly ſee he will find no trouble, I
ſhall proceed in perſon this afternoon for Montreal, and from thence make
my final arrangements for purſuing the King's orders.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould think myſelf deficient in juſtice and in
honour, were I cloſe my letter without mentioning the ſenſe I entertain
of General Carleton's conduct; that he was anxiouſly deſirous of leading
the military operations out of the province, is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diſcerned;

                        <p>The only delay is occaſioned by the impracticability of the

ſpeedily removed, by exerting the ſervices of the pariſhes as ſoon as
the weather clears. In the mean time, I am employing every means that water
carriage will admit for drawing the troops and ſtores towards their point. I
truſt, I ſhall have veſſels ſufficient to move the army and ſtores

lead the enemy to ſuſpect, that after the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ticonderago, my
views are pointed that way, the Connecticut forces will be

gain a ſtart that may much expedite and facilitate my progreſs to

                        <p>THE great King, our common father, and the patron of all who
ſeek and deſerve his protection, has conſidered with ſatisfaction the
general conduct of the Indian tribes from the beginning of the troubles in
America. Too ſagacious and too faithful to be deluded or corrupted, they have
obſerved the violated rights of the parental power they love, and burned to
vindicate them. A few individuals alone, the refuſe of a ſmall tribe, at
the firſt were led aſtray, and the miſrepreſentations, the ſpecious
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, the inſidious promiſes and diverſified plots, in which the
rebels are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and all of which they employed for that effect, have
ſerved only in the end to enhance the honour of the tribes in general, by
demonſtrating to the world, how few and how contemptible are the apoſtates.
It is a truth known to you all, that theſe pitiful examples excepted, and
they probably have before this day hid their faces in ſhame, the collective
voices and hands of the Indian tribes over this vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, are on the
ſide of juſtice, of law, and of the King.</p>
                        <p>The reſtraint you have put upon your reſentment in waiting
the King your father's call to arms, the hardeſt proof, I am perſuaded, to
which your affection could have been put, is another manifeſt and affected
mark of your adherence to that principle of connection to which you were always
fond to allude, and which it is mutually the joy and the duty of the parent to
cheriſh.</p>
                        <p>The clemency of your father has been abuſed, the offers of
his mercy have been deſpiſed, and his farther patience would, in his eyes,
become culpable, in as much as it would withold redreſs from the moſt
grievous oppreſſions in the provinces thatever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced the hiſtory
of mankind. It therefore remains for me, the General of one of his Majeſty's
armies, and in this council his repreſentative, to releaſe you from thoſe
bonds which your obedience impoſed.—Warriors, you are free—Go
forth in might of your valour and your cauſe; ſtrike at the common enemies
of Great-Britain and America—diſturbers of public order, peace, and
happineſs—deſtroyers of commerce, parricides of the ſtate.</p>
                        <p>The circle round you, the chiefs of his Majeſty's European
forces, and of the Princes his allies, eſteem you as brothers in the war;
emulous in glory and in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we will endeavour reciprocally to give
and to receive examples; we know how to value, and we will ſtrive to imitate
your perſeverance in enterprize, and your conſtancy to reſiſt hunger,
wearineſs, and pain. Be it our taſk, from the dictates of 
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0652302600:159"/> our religion, the laws of our warefare, and the
principles and intereſt of our policy, to regulate your paſſions when
they overbear, to point out were it is nobler to ſpare than to revenge, to
diſcriminate degrees of guilt, to ſuſpend the up-liſted ſtroke, to
chaſtiſe, and not to deſtroy.</p>
                        <p>This war to you, my friends, is new; upon all former
occaſions in taking the field you held yourſelves authorized to deſtroy
wherever you came, becauſe every where you found an enemy. The caſe is now
very different.</p>
                        <p>The King has many faithful ſubjects diſperſed in the
provinces, conſequently you have many brothers there; and theſe people are
the more to be pitied, that they are perſecuted, or impriſoned, wherever
they are diſcovered, or ſuſpected, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, is, to a generous
mind, a yet more grievous puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>Perſuaded that your magnanimity of character, joined to your
principles of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King, will give me fuller controul over your
minds, than the military rank with which I am inveſted, I enjoin your moſt
ſerious attention to the rules which I hereby proclaim for your invariable
obſervation during the campaign.</p>
                        <p>I poſitively forbid bloodſhed, when you are not oppoſed
in arms.</p>
                        <p>Aged men, women, children, and priſoners, muſt be held
ſacred from the knife or hatchet, even in the time of actual conflict.</p>
                        <p>You ſhall receive compenſation for the priſoners you
take, but you ſhall be called to account for ſcalps.</p>
                        <p>In conformity and indulgence to your cuſtoms, which have
affixed an idea of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſuch badges of victory, you ſhall be allowed
to take the ſcalps of the dead, when killed by your fire, and in fair
oppoſition; but on no account, or pretence, or ſubtlety, or prevarication,
are they to be taken from the wounded, or even dying; and ſtill leſs
pardonable, if poſſible, will it be held, to kill men in that condition, on
purpoſe, and upon a ſuppoſition, that this protection to the wounded,
would be thereby evaded.</p>
                        <p>Baſe lurking aſſaſſins, incendiaries, ravagers, and
plunderers of the country, to whatever army they may belong, ſhall be treated
with leſs reſerve; but the latitude muſt be given you by order, and I
muſt be the judge of the occaſion.</p>
                        <p>Should the enemy, on their part, dare to countenance acts of
barbarity towards thoſe who may fall into their hands, it ſhall be yours
alſo to retaliate; but till ſeverity ſhall be thus compelled, bear
immoveable in your hearts this ſolid maxim, it cannot be too deeply
impreſſed, that the great eſſential reward, worthy ſervice of your
alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the ſincerity of your zeal to the King your father, and
never-failing protector, will be examined, and judged upon the teſt only of
your ſteady and uniform adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the orders and counſels of thoſe to
whom his Majeſty has intruſted the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the honour of his
arms.</p>

advanced corps, conſiſting of the Britiſh light infantry and grenadiers,
the 24th regiment, ſome Canadians and Savages, and ten pieces of light
artillery, under the command of Brigadier General Fraſer, to move from Putnam
Creek, where they had been encamped ſome days, up the weſt ſhore of the
lake to Four-Mile-Point, ſo called from being within that diſtance off the
fort of Ticoderoga. The German reſerve, conſiſting of the Brunſwick
chaſſeurs, light infantry and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers under Lieutenant Colonel Breyman
were moved at the ſame time to Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's farm, on the eaſt ſhore,
oppoſite to Putnam Creek.</p>

                                    <note place="margin">1ſt July.</note>The whole army made
a movement forward. Brigadier Fraſer's corps occupied the ſtrong poſt
called Three-Mile-Point, on the weſt ſhore; the German reſerve the
eaſt-ſhore oppoſite: the army encamped in two lines, the right wing at
the Four-Mile-Point, the left wing nearly oppoſite, on the eaſt
ſhore.</p>
                                 <p>The Royal George, and Inflexible frigates, with the
gun-boats, were anchored at this time juſt without the reach of the enemy's
batteries, and covered the lake from the weſt to the eaſt ſhores. The
reſt of the fleet had been ſome time without guns, in order to aſſiſt
in carrying proviſions over Lake Champlain.</p>
                                 <p>The enemy appeared to be poſted as follows. A brigade
occupied the old French lines on the height to the north of the fort of
Ticonderoga. Theſe lines were in good repair, and had ſeveral intrenchments
behind them, chiefly calculated to guard the north-weſt flank, and were
further ſuſtained by a block-houſe. They had, farther to 
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0652302600:161"/> their left, a poſt at the ſaw-mills, which are at the
foot of the carrying-place to Lake George, and a block-houſe upon an eminence
above the mills, and a block-houſe and hoſpital at the entrance of the
lake.</p>
                                 <p>Upon the right of the lines, and between them and the
old fort, there were two new block-houſes and a conſiderable battery
cloſe to the water edge.</p>
                                 <p>It ſeemed that the enemy had employed their chief
induſtry, and were in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt force upon Mount Independence, which is
high and circular, and upon the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, which is Table Land, was a ſtar
fort, made of pickets, and well ſupplied with artillery, and a large ſquare
of barracks within it. The foot of the hill, on the ſide which projects into
the lake, was intrenched and had a ſtrong abbattis cloſe to the water. This
intrenchment was lined with heavy artillery, pointed down the lake flanking the
water battery, above deſcribed, and ſuſtained by another battery about
half way up the hill. On the weſt ſide the hill runs the main river, and in
its paſſage is joined by the water which comes down from Lake George. The
enemy had here a bridge of communication, which could not at this time be
reconnoitred. On the eaſt ſide of the hill the water forms a ſmall bay,
into which falls a rivulet after having encirculed in its courſe part of the
hill to the ſouth eaſt. The ſide to the ſouth could not be ſeen, but
was deſcribed as inacceſſible.</p>

                                    <note place="margin">July 2.</note>About nine in the
morning a ſmoke was obſerved towards Lake George, and the Savages brought
in a report that the enemy had ſet fire to the further block-houſe and had
abandoned the ſaw-mills, and that a conſiderable body were advancing from
the lines towards a bridge upon the road which led from the ſaw-mills towards
the right of the Britiſh camp. A detachment of the advanced corps was
immediately put in march, under the command of Brigadier Fraſer, ſupported
by the ſecond brigade and ſome light artillery, under the command of Major
General Phillips, with orders to proceed to Mount Hope, which is to the north
of the lines, to reconnoitre the enemy's poſition, and to take advantage of
any poſt they might abandon or be driven from. The Indians under Captain
Fraſer, ſupported by his company of markſmen, were directed to make a
circuit to the left of Brigadier Fraſer's line of march, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to
cut off the retreat of the enemy to their lines; but this deſign miſcarried
through the impetuoſity of the Indians, who attacked too ſoon, and in
front; and the enemy were thereby able to retire with the loſs of one officer
and a few men killed, and one officer wounded. Major General Phillips took
poſſeſſion of the very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous poſt of Mount Hope this night,
and the enemy were thereby entirely cut off from all communication with Lake
George.</p>

                                    <note place="margin">July 3.</note>Mount Hope was occupied
in force by General Fraſer's whole corps. The firſt Britiſh brigade, and
two entire brigades of artillery. The ſecond brigade, Britiſh, encamped
upon the left of the firſt, and the brigade of Gall, having been drawn from
the eaſt ſhore to occupy the ground where Fraſer's corps had originally
been; the line became compleat, extending from Three-Mile-Point to the
weſtermoſt part of Mount Hope; on the ſame day, Major General Reideſel
encamped on the eaſt ſhore in a parallel line with Three-Mile-Point, having
puſhed the reſerve forward near the rivulet which encircles Mount
Independence. The enemy cannonaded the camps of Mount Hope and of the German
reſerve during moſt part of this day, but without effect.</p>

the commanding engineer, was ordered to reconnoitre Sugar Hill, on the ſouth
ſide of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap>ommunion from Lake
George into Lake Champlain, which had been poſſeſſed in the night by a
party of light infantry. It appeared at firſt to be a very advantageous
poſt, and it is now known that the enemy had a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſome time ago upon
the expediency of poſſeſſing it; but the idea was rejected, upon the
ſuppoſition that it was impoſſible for a corps to be eſtabliſhed
there in force. Lieutenant Twiſs reported this hill to have the entire
command of the works and buildings both of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence,
at the d ſtance of about 1400 yards from the former, and 1500 from the
latter; that the ground might be levelled ſo as to receive cannon, and that
the road to convey them, though difficult, might be made practicable in
twenty-four hours. This hill alſo commanded, in reverſe, the bridge of
communication; ſaw the exact ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their veſſels; nor could the
enemy, during the day, make any material movement or preparation, without being
diſcovered, and even having their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers counted,</p>
                                 <p>It was determined that a battery ſhould be raiſed on
Sugar Hill for light twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four pounders, medium twelves, and eight-inch
howitzers. This very arduous work was carried on ſo rapidly that the battery
would have been ready the next day.</p>
                                 <p>It is a duty in this place to do ſome juſtice to the
zeal and activity of Major General Phillips, who had the direction of the
operation, and having mentioned that moſt valuable officer, I truſt it
cannot be thought a digreſſion to add, that it is to his judicious
arrangements and indefatigable pains, during the general ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency of
preparation which Sir Guy Carleton entruſted to him in the winter and
ſpring, that the ſervice is indebted for its preſent forwardneſs. The
preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of contrary winds and other accidents having rendered it
impoſſible for any neceſſaries prepared in England for the opening of
the campaign, yet to reach the camp.</p>

                                    <note place="margin">6th July.</note>Soon after day-light
an officer arrived expreſs, on board the Royal George, where in the night I
took up my quarters, as the moſt centrical ſituation, with information from
Brigadier Fraſer that the enemy were retiring, and that he was advancing with
his picquets, leaving orders for the brigade to follow as ſoon as they could
accoutre, with intention to purſue by land. This movement was very
diſcernible, as were the Britiſh colours, which the Brigadier had fixed
upon the fort of Ticonderoga. Knowing how ſafely I could truſt to that
officer's conduct. I turned my chief attention to the purſuit by water, by
which route I underſtood one column were retiring in two hundred and twenty
bateaux, covered by five armed gallies.</p>
                                 <p>The great bridge of communication, through which a way
was to be opened, was ſupported by twenty-two ſunken piers of large timber,
at nearly equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; the ſpace between were made of ſeparate
floats, each about fifty feet long, and twelve feet wide, ſtrongly faſtened
together by chains and rivets, and alſo faſtened to the ſunken piers.
Before this bridge was a boom, made of very <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0652302600:163"/> large
pieces of timber, faſtened together by rivetted bolts and double chains, made
of iron an inch and an half ſquare.</p>
                                 <p>The gun-boats were inſtantly moved forward, and the
boom and one of the intermediate floats were cut with great dexterity and
diſpatch, and Commodore Lutwidge, with the officers and ſeamen in his
department, partaking the general animation, a paſſage was formed in half
an hour for the frigates alſo, through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which the enemy had been
labouring to conſtruct ſince laſt autumn.</p>
                                 <p>During this operation Major General Reideſel had
paſſed to Mount Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with the corps, Breyman, and part of the
left wing. He was directed to proceed by land, to ſuſtain Brigadier
Fraſer, or to act more to the left, if he ſaw it expedient ſo to do.</p>
                                 <p>The 62d regiment Britiſh, and the Brunſwick regiment
of Prince Frederick, were ſtationed at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in
the place of the parties of Fraſer's brigade, which had been left in
poſſeſſion of the artillery and ſtores, and the reſt of the army
was ordered to follow up the river as they could be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, without regard
to the place in the line.</p>
                                 <p>About three in the afternoon I arrived with the Royal
George and Inflexible; and the beſt ſailing gun-boats at South Bay, within
three miles of Skeneſborough, at which latter place the enemy were poſted
in a ſtockaded fort, and their armed gallies in the falls below.</p>
                                 <p>The foremoſt regiments, viz. the 9th, 20th, and
21ſt, were immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embarked, and aſcended the mountains with the
intention of getting behind the fort, and cutting off the retreat of the enemy;
but their precipitate flight rendered this manoeuvre ineffectual. The gun-boats
and frigates continued their courſe to Skeneſborough Falls, where the armed
veſſels were poſted. Captain Carter, with part of his brigade of
gun-boats, immediately attacked, and with ſo much ſpirit, that two of the
veſſels very ſoon ſtruck; the other three were blown up, and the enemy
having previouſly prepared combuſtible materials, ſet fire to the fort,
mills, ſtorehouſes, bateaux, &amp;c. and retired with the detachment left
for that purpoſe, the main body having gone off when the troops were
aſcending the mountain. A great quantity of proviſions and ſome arms were
here conſumed, and moſt of their officers' baggage was burnt, ſunk, or
taken. Their loſs is not known; about 30 priſoners were made, among which
were two wounded officers.</p>
                                 <p>During theſe operations upon the right, Brigadier
General Fraſer continued his purſuit to Caſtletown till one o'clock,
having marched in a very hot day from four o'clock in the morning till that
time. Some ſtragglers of the enemy were picked up, from whom the Brigadier
learned that their rear guard was compoſed of choſen men, and commanded by
Colonel Francis, one of their beſt officers. During the time that the men
were refreſhing, Major General Reideſel came up, and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for
continuing the purſuit having been concerted, Brigadier Fraſer moved
forward again, and during the night lay upon his arms, in an advantageous
ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, three miles nearer the enemy.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <note place="margin">7th July.</note>At three in the
morning he renewed his march, and about five his advanced ſcouts diſcovered
the enemy's centries, who fired their pieces and joined the main body. The
Brigadier obſerving a commanding ground to the left of his light infantry,
immediately ordered it to be poſſeſſed by that corps; and a
conſiderable body of the enemy attempting the ſame, they met. The enemy
were driven back <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0652302600:164"/> to their original poſt; the
advanced guard under Major Grant was by this time engaged, and the grenadiers
were advanced to ſuſtain them, and to prevent the right flank from being
turned. The Brigadier remained on the left, where the enemy long defended
themſelves by the aid of logs and trees, and after being repulſed, and
prevented getting to the Caſtletown road by the grenadiers, they rallied, and
renewed the action; and upon a ſecond repulſe, attempted their retreat by
Pitsford Mountain. The grenadiers ſcrambled up a part of that aſcent,
appearing almoſt inacceſſible, and gained the ſummit before them, which
threw them into confuſion; they were ſtill greatly ſuperior in numbers,
and conſequently in extent, and the brigadier, in momentary expectation of
the Brunſwickers, had latterally drawn from his left to ſupport his right.
At this critical moment General Reideſel, who had preſſed on, upon
hearing the firing, arrived with the foremoſt of his columns, viz. the
chaſſeurs company and eighty grenadiers and light infantry. His judgment
immediately pointed to him the courſe to take; he extended upon Brigadier
Fraſer's left flank. The chaſſeurs got into action with great gallantry,
under Major Barner. They fled on all ſides, leaving dead upon the field
Colonel Francis and many other officers, with upwards of 200 men; above 600
were wounded, moſt of whom periſhed in the woods, attempting to get off,
and one colonel, ſeven captains, ten ſubalterns, and 210 men were made
priſoners; above 200 ſtand of arms were alſo taken.</p>
                                 <p>The number of the enemy before the engagement amounted
to 2000 men. The Britiſh detachment under Brigadier General Fraſer (the
parties left the day before at Ticonderoga not having been able to join)
conſiſted only of 850 fighting men.</p>
                                 <p>The bare relation of ſo ſignal an action is
ſufficient for its praiſe. Should the attack againſt ſuch inequality of
numbers, before the German brigade came up, ſeem to require explanation, it
is to be conſidered that the enemy might have eſcaped by delay; that the
advanced guard on a ſudden found themſelves too near the enemy to avoid
action without retreating; and that Brigadier Fraſer had ſuppoſed the
German troops to be very near. The difference of time in their arrival was
merely accidental. The Germans puſhed for a ſhare in the glory, and they
arrived in time to obtain it. I have only to add, that the exertions of
Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier Fraſer on this day were but a continuance of that uniform
intelligence, activity and bravery, which diſtinguiſh his character upon
all occaſions, and entitle him to be recommended, in the moſt particular
manner, to his Majeſty's favour.</p>
                                 <p>The officers and ſoldiers of this brigade have
prevented any diſtinctions of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals by a general and equal diſplay
of ſpirit.</p>
                                 <p>The country people about Skeneſborough having reported
that part of the enemy were ſtill retreating, the 9th regiment was detached,
with orders to take poſt near Fort Anne, and obſerve the enemy's motions.
This was effected, but with great difficulty, as the roads were almoſt
impracticable, and the bridges broken. The other troops were employed all that
day and night in dragging fifty bateaux over the carrying place at Wood Creek,
to facilitate the movement of the reſt of the firſt brigade to Fort Anne,
to diſlodge the enemy.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <note place="margin">8th July.</note>A report was received
from Lieutenant Colonel Hill (9th regiment) that the enemy had been reinforced
in the night by a conſiderable body of freſh men; that he could not retire
with his regiment before them, but he would maintain his ground. The two
remaining regiments of the firſt brigade were ordered to quicken 
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0652302600:165"/> their march, and upon ſecond intelligence of the
enemy, and firing being heard, the 20th regiment was ordered forward with two
pieces of artillery, and Major General Phillips was ſent to take the command.
A violent ſtorm of rain, which laſted the whole day, prevented the troops
from getting to Fort Anne ſo ſoon as was intended; but the delay gave the
9th regiment an opportunity of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, by ſtanding
and repulſing an attack of ſix times their number. The enemy finding the
poſition not to be forced in front, endeavoured to turn it; and from the
ſuperiority of their numbers that inconvenience was to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; and
Lieutenant Colonel Hill found it neceſſary to change his poſition in the
height of action: ſo critical an order was executed by the regiment with the
utmoſt ſteadineſs and bravery. The enemy, after an attack of three hours,
were totally repulſed, and fled towards Fort Edward, ſetting fire to Fort
Anne, but leaving a ſaw-mill and a block-houſe in good repair, which were
afterwards poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the king's troops.</p>
                                 <p>The 9th regiment acquired, during their expedition,
about thirty priſoners, ſome ſtores and baggage, and colours of the 2d
Hampſhire regiment.</p>
                                 <p>One unlucky accident happened, to counterbalance, in
ſome degree, this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Captain Montgomery, an officer of great
merit, was wounded early in the action, and was in the act of being dreſſed
by the ſurgeon when the regiment changed ground; being unable to help
himſelf, he and the ſurgeon were taken priſoners. I ſince hear he has
been well treated, and is in a fair way of recovery at Albany.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <note place="margin">9th and 10th July.</note>The army
very much fatigued (many parts of it having wanted their proviſions for two
days, almoſt the whole their tents and baggage) aſſembled in their
preſent poſition. The right wing occupies the heights of Skeneſborough in
two lines; the right flank to the mountains, covered by the regiment of
Reideſel's dragoons, <hi>en potence;</hi> the left to the Wood Creek.</p>
                                 <p>The Brunſwick troops under Major General Reideſel
upon Caſtletown River, with Breyman's corps upon the communication of roads
leading to Putney and Rutland; the regiment of Heſſe Hanau are poſted at
the head of Eaſt Creek, to preſerve the communication with the camp at
Caſtletown River, and ſecure the bateaux.</p>
                                 <p>Brigadier Fraſer's corps is in the centre, ready to
move on either wing of the army.</p>
                                 <p>The ſcattered remains of the enemy are at Fort Edward,
on the Hudſon's River, where they have been joined, as I am informed, by
General Putnam, with a conſiderable corps of freſh troops.</p>
                                 <p>Roads are opening for the army to march to them by Fort
Anne, and the Wood Creek is clearing of fallen trees, ſunken ſtones, and
other obſtacles, to give paſſage to bateaux for carrying artillery,
ſtores, proviſions and camp equipage. Theſe are laborious works; but the
ſpirit and zeal of the troops are ſufficient to ſurmount them. Some
little time muſt alſo be allowed for the ſupplies of proviſions to
overtake us. In the mean time all poſſible diligence is uſing at
Ticonderoga to get the gun-boats, proviſion veſſels, and a proper
quantity of bateaux into Lake George. A corps of the army will be ordered to
penetrate by that route, which will afterwards be the route for the magazines;
and a junction of the whole is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at Fort Edward.</p>

                        <p>HAVING given your Lordſhip a detail, in my public letter of
this date, of the late tranſactions, I now do myſelf the honour to ſtate
to your Lordſhip, ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as appear to me more proper for a
private communication.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Peters and Mr. Jeſſup, who came over to Canada laſt
autumn, and propoſed to raiſe battalions, one from the neighbourhood of
Albany, the other from Charlotte county, are confident of ſucceſs as the
army advances. Their battalions are now in embryo, but very promiſing; they
have fought, and with ſpirit. Sir Guy Carleton has given me blank
commiſſions for the officers, to fill up occaſionally, and the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them is, that the commiſſions are not to be ſo effective, till two
thirds of the battalions are raiſed. Some hundreds of men, a third part of
them with arms, have joined me ſince I have penerated this place,
profeſſing themſelves loyaliſts, and wiſhing to ſerve, ſome to
the end of the war, ſome for the campaign. Though I am without inſtructions
upon this ſubject, I have not heſitated to receive them, and as faſt as
companies can be formed, I ſhall poſt the officers till a deciſion can be
made upon the meaſure by my ſuperiors. I mean to employ them particularly
upon detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for keeping the country in awe, and procuring cattle; their
real uſe I expect will be great in the preſervation of the national troops:
but the impreſſion which will be cauſed upon public opinion, ſhould
provincials be ſeen acting vigorouſly in the cauſe of the King, will be
yet more advantageous, and, I truſt, fully juſtify the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
                        <p>The manifeſto, of which I encloſed your Lordſhip a copy
in my laſt diſpatches, and herewith ſend a duplicate, has great effect
where the country is not in the power of the rebels; where it is, the
committees turn all their efforts to counteract it. They watch or impriſon
all ſuſpected perſons, compel the people in general to take arms, and to
drive the cattle, and to burn the corn, under penalty of immediate death. Great
numbers have been hanged. Should theſe wretches ſucceed to make a deſert
of the country, by fire and maſſacre, it will at leaſt be a pleaſing
reflection, that while advantages are reaped from the clement part of the
manifeſto, they, and not the King's troops, are the executioners of its
threats.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordſhip will have obſerved, I have made no mention
of the Indians, in the purſuit from Ticonderoga. It is not poſſible to
draw them in many reſpects from the plunder of that place, and I
confidentially acknowledge this is not the only inſtance in which I have
found little more than a name. If, under the management of their conductors,
they are indulged, for intereſted reaſons, in all the caprices and humours
of ſpoiled children, like them they grow more unreaſonable and importunate
upon <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0652302600:167"/> every new favour; were they left to themſelves,
enormities too horrid to think of would enſue, guilty and innocent, women and
infants, would be a common prey.</p>
                        <p>This is the character of the lower Canadian Indians, who alone
have been with the army hitherto. I am informed the Outawas, and other remote
nations, who are within two days march of joining me, are more brave and more
tractable; that they profeſs war, not pillage. They are under the directions
of a M. St. Luc, a Canadian gentleman of honour and parts, and one of the
beſt partizans the French had laſt war, and of one Langlade, the very man
who projected and executed with theſe very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the defeat of General
Braddock. My firſt intention was to turn this whole corps to the Connecticut
immediately, to force a ſupply of proviſions, to intercept reinforcements,
and to confirm the jealouſy I have in many ways endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in the
New England provinces; but finding that the enemy are labouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
their magazines from Forts George and Edward, and every where deſtroying the
roads, and preparing to drive and burn the country towards Albany, I have
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to employ them, to prevent, if poſſible, by their terror, the
continuance of thoſe operations. And after arriving at Albany, they may be
employed to renew the alarm towards Connecticut and Boſton.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordſhip will pardon me if I a little lament that my
orders do not give me the latitude I ventured to propoſe in my original
project for the campaign, to make a real effort inſtead of a feint upon New
England. As things have turned out, were I at liberty to march in force
immediately by my left, inſtead of my right, I ſhould have little doubt of
ſubduing before winter the provinces where the rebellion origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated.</p>
                        <p>If my late letters reach Mr. Howe, I ſtill hope this plan
may be adopted from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany; in the mean while my utmoſt exertions ſhall
continue, according to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, to force a junction.</p>
                        <p>I have ſent ſome Indians through the woods, in the hope of
their reaching St. Leger, with the account of my progreſs; now is the
critical time for his puſh upon the Mohawk. I have certain intelligence that
all the country round Fort Stanwix is in alarm: but I imagine it proceeds from
the appearance of ſome Savages detached by Colonel Butler, not apprehending
St. Leger can be got quite ſo forward.</p>

                        <p>IN my laſt diſpatch (a duplicate of which will be
incloſed herewith) I had the honour to inform your Lordſhip of the
proceedings of the army under my command to the 30th of July.</p>
                        <p>From that period to the 15th of Auguſt every poſſible
meaſure was employed to bring forward bateaux, proviſions, and ammunition
from Fort George to the firſt navigable part of Hudſon's River, a
diſtance of eighteen miles, the roads in ſome parts ſteep, and in others
wanting great repair. Of the horſes furniſhed by contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t in Canada not more than a third part
was yet arrived. The delay was not imputable <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0652302600:168"/> to
neglect, but to the natural accidents attending ſo long and intricate a
combination of land and water carriage. Fifty team of oxen, which had been
collected in the country through which I had marched, were added to
aſſiſt the tranſport; but theſe reſources together were found far
inadequate to the purpoſes of feeding the army, and forming a magazine at the
ſame time. Exceeding heavy rains augmented the impediments. It was often
neceſſary to employ ten or twelve oxen upon a ſingle bateau; and after
the utmoſt exertions for the fifteen days above ſtated, there were not
above four days proviſion before hand, nor above ten bateaux in the
river.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence had reached me that Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger
was before Fort Stanwix, which was defended. The main army of the enemy
oppoſed to me was at Stillwater, a place between Saratoga and the mouth of
the Mohawk.</p>
                        <p>A rapid movement forward appeared to be of the utmoſt
conſequence at this period. The enemy could not have proceeded up the Mohawk
without putting themſelves between two fires, in caſe Colonel St. Leger
ſhould have ſucceeded; and at beſt being cut off by my army from Albany.
They muſt either therefore have ſtood an action, have fallen back towards
Albany, or have paſſed the Hudſon's River, in order to ſecure a retreat
to New England, higher up. Which ever of theſe meaſures they had taken,
ſo that the King's army had been enabled to advance, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel St. Leger's
operations would have been aſſiſted, a junction with him probably
ſecured, and the whole country of the Mohawk opened. To maintain the
commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with Fort George during ſuch a movement, ſo as to be
ſupplied by daily degrees at a diſtance, continually increaſing, was an
obvious impoſſibility. The army was much too weak to have afforded a chain
of poſts. Eſcorts for every ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate tranſport would have been a
ſtill greater drain; nor could any have been made ſo ſtrong as to force
their way through ſuch poſitions as the enemy might take in one night's
march from the White Creek, where they had a numerous militia. Had the enemy
remained ſupine, through fear or want of comprehending ſo palpable an
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the phyſical impoſſibility of being ſupplied by degrees
from Fort George was ſtill in force, becauſe a new neceſſity of land
carriage for nine miles ariſes at Still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water; and in the proportion that
carriages had been brought forward to that place, the tranſport muſt have
ceaſed behind.</p>
                        <p>The alternative therefore was ſhort; either to relinquiſh
the favourable opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of advancing upon the enemy, or to attempt other
reſources of ſupply.</p>
                        <p>It was well known that the enemy's ſupplies in live cattle,
from a large tract of country, paſſed by the route of Mancheſter,
Arlington, and other parts of the Hampſhire Grants, to Bennington, in order
to be occaſionally conveyed from thence to the main army. A large depoſit
of corn and of wheel carriages was alſo formed at the ſame place, and the
uſual guard was militia, though it varied in numbers from day to day. A
ſcheme was formed to ſurpriſe Bennington. The poſſeſſion of the
cattle and carriages would certainly have enabled the army to leave their
diſtant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, and to have acted with energy and diſpatch: ſucceſs
would alſo have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many ſecondary purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>Lieut. Col. Baume, an officer well qualified for the
undertaking, was fixed upon to command. He had under him 200 diſmounted
dragoons of the regiment of Riede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, Captain Fraſer's markſmen, which
were the only Britiſh, all the Canadian volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, a party of the
Provincials who perfectly knew the country, 100 Indians, and two light pieces
of cannon; the whole detachment amounted to abo ut 500 men. The inſtructions
were poſitive to keep the regular corps poſted while thel ight troops felt 
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0652302600:169"/> their way, and not to incur the danger of being
ſurrounded, or having a retreat cut off.</p>
                        <p>In order to facilitate this operation, and to be ready to take
advantage of its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, the army moved up the eaſt ſhore of
Hudſon's River. On the 14th, a bridge was formed of rafts, over which the
advanced corps paſſed and encamped at Saratoga. Lieutenant Colonel
Breyman's corps were poſted near Batten Kill, and upon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from
Colonel Baume, that the enemy were ſtronger at Bennington than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and
were aware of his attack, that corps, conſiſting of the Brunſwick
gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers, light infantry and chaſſeurs, were ſent forward to
ſuſtain him.</p>
                        <p>It ſince appears that Lieutenant Colonel Baume, not having
been able to complete his march undiſcovered, was joined at a place called
Sancoix Mills, about four miles ſhort of Bennington, by many people
profeſſing themſelves to be Loyaliſts. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial gentleman of
confidence who had been ſent with the detachment, as knowing the country and
the character of the inhabitants, was ſo incautious as to leave at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſuch as took the oath of allegiance.</p>
                        <p>His credulity and their profligacy cauſed the firſt
misfortune. Colonel Baume was induced to proceed without ſufficient knowledge
of the ground. His deſign was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed; the men who had taken the oaths were
the firſt to fire upon him; he was attacked on all ſides. He ſhewed great
perſonal courage, but was overpowered by numbers.</p>
                        <p>During this time Lieutenant Colonel Breyman was upon the march
through a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy rain; and ſuch were the other impediments ſtated in that
officer's report, of bad roads, tired horſes, difficulties in paſſing
artillery, carriages, &amp;c. that he was from eight in the morning of the 15th
to four in the afternoon of the following day making about twenty-four
miles.</p>
                        <p>He engaged, fought gallantly, and drove the enemy from three
ſeveral heights; but was too late to ſuccour Colonel Baume, who was made
priſoner, and a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of his dragoons were killed or taken.
The failure of ammunition, from the accidental breaking to pieces of a tumbril,
unfortunately obliged Lieutenant Colonel Breyman to retire conquering troops,
and to leave behind two pieces of cannon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides two which had been loſt
by Lieutenant Colonel Baume. The Indians made good their retreat from the
firſt affair, as did Captain Fraſer, with part of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and many of
the Provincials and Canadians.</p>
                        <p>The loſs, as at preſent appears, amounts to about 400 men,
killed and taken in both actions, and twenty-ſix officers, moſtly
priſoners; but men who were diſperſed in the woods drop in daily. A
correct return ſhall be tranſmitted to your Lordſhip the firſt
opportunity.</p>
                        <p>This, my Lord, is a true ſtate of the event. I have not
dwelt upon errors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in many inſtances they were counterbalanced by
ſpirit. The enemy will of courſe find matter of parade in the acquiſition
of four pieces of cannon: but that apart, they have ſmall cauſe of
exultation; their loſs in killed and wounded being more than double to ours,
by the confeſſion of their priſoners and deſerters, and of many
inhabitants who were witneſſes to the burial of their dead.</p>
                        <p>The chief ſubject of regret on our ſide, after that which
any loſs of gallant men naturally occaſions, is the diſappointment of not
obtaining live cattle, and the loſs of time in bringing forward the
magazines.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:0652302600:170"/> This heavy work is now nearly
completed, and a new bridge of boats is thrown over the Hudſon's River,
oppoſite to Saratoga, the former one of rafts having been carried away by the
ſwell of water after the late continual rains. When enabled to move, nothing
within my ſcale of talent ſhall be left unattempted to fulfil his
Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's orders, and I hope circumſtances will be ſuch, that my
endeavours may be in ſome degree aſſiſted by a co-operation of the army
under Sir William Howe.</p>

                        <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I NEED not enlarge upon the concern I have in communicating any
ſiniſter events. I am perſuaded your Lordſhip will give me credit for
partaking every ſentiment that your Lordſhip, or any other man warmed with
principle and zeal in this conteſt, can feel.</p>
                     <p>In regard to the affair of Saintcoick, I have only to add to the
public account, that if ever there was a ſituation to juſtify enterprize
and exertion, out of the beaten track of military ſervice, it was that in
which I found myſelf. Had I ſucceeded, I ſhould have effected a junction
with St. Leger, and been now before Albany. And I flatter myſelf, I need only
mention thoſe views, to ſhew that in hazarding this expedition I had the
ſoundeſt principles of military reaſoning on my ſide, viz. that the
advantages to be expected from ſucceſs were in a great degree ſuperior to
the evils that could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend miſcarriage. The ſecondary purpoſes, to
which I alluded in the public letter, were to try the affections of the
country; to complete the Provincial corps, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits for which were unable
to eſcape from their villages without a force to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and protect them;
and to diſtract the councils of the enemy, by continuing their jealouſy
towards New England.</p>
                     <p>Major General Reideſel has preſſed upon me repeatedly the
mounting his dragoons, the men were animated with the ſame deſire, and I
conceived it a moſt favourable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to give into their ideas and
ſolicitations, becauſe in exerting their zeal to fulfil their favourite
purpoſe, they neceſſarily would effect the greater purpoſe of my own.
The reſt of the troops were ſelected from ſuch as would leaſt weaken
the ſolid ſtrength of the army, in caſe of ill ſucceſs; and I thought
it expedient to take a little trial of the Provincials and Canadians before I
might have occaſion for them in more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant actions.</p>
                     <p>The original detachment could not have been made larger without
opening roads, and other preparations of time, nor ſhould I have thought it
juſtifiable to expoſe the beſt troops to loſs upon a collateral action.
Had my inſtructions been followed, or could Mr. Breyman have marked at the
rate of two miles an hour any given twelve hours out of the two and thirty,
ſucceſs would probably have enſued, misfortune would certainly have been
avoided. I did not think it prudent, in the preſent criſis, to mark theſe
circumſtances to the public ſo ſtrongly as I do in confidence to your 
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:0652302600:171"/> Lordſhip; but I rely, and I will venture to ſay I
expect, becauſe I think juſtice will warrant the expectation, that while,
for the ſake of public harmony, that neceſſary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple for conducting
nice and laborious ſervice, I colour the faults of the execution, your
Lordſhip will, in your goodneſs, be my advocate to the King, and to the
world, in vindication of the plan.</p>
                     <p>The conſequences of this affair, my Lord, have little effect
upon the ſtrength or ſpirits of the army; but the proſpect of the
campaign in other reſpects, is far leſs proſperous than when I wrote
laſt. In ſpire of St. Leger's victory, Fort Stanwix holds out
obſtinately. I am afraid the expectations of Sir J. Johnſon greatly fail in
the riſing of the country. On this ſide I find daily reaſon to doubt the
ſincerity of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the profeſſing loyaliſts. I have
about 400, but not half of them armed, who may be depended upon; the reſt are
trimmers, merely actuated by intereſt. The great bulk of the country is
undoubtedly with the Congreſs, in principle and in zeal; and their meaſures
are executed with a ſecrecy and diſpatch that are not to be equalled.
Wherever the King's forces point, militia, to the amount of three or four
thouſand aſſemble in twenty-four hours; they bring with them their
ſubſiſtence, &amp;c. and, the alarm over, they return to their farms. The
Hampſhire Grants in particular, a country unpeopled and almoſt unknown in
the laſt war, now abounds in the moſt active and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious race of
the continent, and hangs like a gathering ſtorm upon my left. In all parts
the induſtry and managment in driving cattle, and removing corn, are
indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable and certain; and it becomes impracticable to move without
portable maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines. Another moſt embarraſſing circumſtance, is the
want of communication with Sir William Howe; of the meſſengers I have
ſent, I know of two being hanged, and am ignorant whether any of the reſt
arrived. The ſame fate has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably attended thoſe diſpatched by Sir
William Howe; for only one letter is come to hand, informing me that his
intention is for Penſylvania; that Waſhington has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached Sullivan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with 2500 men to Albany; that Putnam is
in the Highlands, with 4000 men. That after my arrival at Albany, the movements
of the enemy muſt guide mine; but that he wiſhed the enemy might be driven
out of the province be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any operation took place againſt the Connecticut;
that Sir Henry Clinton remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the command in the neighbourhood of
New-York, and would act as occurrences might direct.</p>
                     <p>No operation, my Lord, has yet been undertaken in my favour: the
highlands have not even been threatened. The conſequence is, that Putnam has
detached two brigades to Mr. Gates, who is now ſtrongly poſted near the
mouth of the Mohawk-River, with an army ſuperior to mine in troops of the
Congreſs, and as many militia as he pleaſes. He is likewiſe far from
being deficient in artillery, having received all the pieces that were landed
from the French ſhips which got into Boſton.</p>
                     <p>Had I a latitude in my orders, I ſhould think it my duty to
wait in this poſition, or perhaps as far back as Fort Edward, where my
communication with Lake George would be perfectly ſecure, till ſome event
happened to aſſiſt my movement forward; but my orders being poſitive to

<q rend="inline">"force a junction with Sir William Howe,"</q> I
appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend I am not at liberty to remain inactive longer than ſhall be
neceſſary to collect twenty-five days proviſion, and to receive the
reinforcement of the additional com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, the German drafts and recruits now
(and unfortunately only now) on Lake Champlain. The waiting the arrival of this
reinforcement is of indiſpenſible neceſſity, becauſe from the hour I
paſs the Hudſon's River and proceed towards Albany, all 
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0652302600:172"/> ſafety of communication ceaſes. I muſt expect a
large body of the enemy from my left will take poſt behind me. I have put out
of the queſtion the waiting longer than the time neceſſary for the
foregoing purpoſes, becauſe the attempt, then critical, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on
adventure and the fortune that often accompanies it, and hardly juſtifiable
but by orders from the ſtate, would afterwards be conſummately deſperate.
I mean my Lord, that by moving ſoon, though I ſhould meet with
inſurmountable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to my progreſs, I ſhall at leaſt have the
chance of fighting my way back to Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, but the ſeaſon a little
further advanced, the diſtance encreaſed, and the march unavoidably tardy,
becauſe ſurrounded by enemies, a retreat might be ſhut by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable
bars or the elements, and at the ſame time no poſſible means of
exiſtence remain in the country.</p>
                     <p>When I wrote more confidently, I little foreſaw that I was to
be left to purſue my way through ſuch a tract of country, and hoſts of
foes, without any co-operation from New-York; nor did I then think the
garriſon of Ticonderoga would fall to my ſhare alone, a dangerous
experiment would it be to leave that poſt in weakneſs, and too heavy a
drain it is upon the life-blood of my force to give it due ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>I yet do not deſpond.—Should I ſucceed in forcing my
way to Albany, and find that country in a ſtate to ſubſiſt my army, I
ſhall think no more of a retreat, but at the worſt fortify there and await
Sir W. Howe's operations.</p>
                     <p>Whatever may be my fate, my Lord, I ſubmit my actions to the
breaſt of the King, and to the candid judgment of my profeſſion, when all
the motives become public; and I reſt in the confidence, that whatever
deciſion may be paſſed upon my conduct, my good intent will not be
queſtioned.</p>
                     <p>I cannot cloſe ſo ſerious a letter without expreſſing
my fulleſt ſatisfaction in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and countenance of the troops,
and my compleat confidence that in all trials they will do whatever can be
expected from men devoted to their King and country.</p>

the manner in which I have expreſſed myſelf, reſpecting the
reinforcement being only upon Lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, may ſeem ambiguous.—I do
not mean to impute the delay to any thing but accidents, nor do I mean to

Ticonderoga, <hi>which is a great event, carried without loſs.</hi> I have
received your two letters, <hi>viz.</hi> from Plymouth and Quebec, your laſt
of the 14th May, and ſhall obſerve the contents. There is a report of a
meſſenger of yours to me having been taken, and the letter diſcovered in
a double wooden canteen, you will know if it was of any conſequence; nothing
of it has tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to us. I will obſerve the <hi>ſame rules</hi> in
writing to you, as you propoſe, in your <pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0652302600:173"/> letters to

about 2500 men, as I learn, to Albany. My intention is for Penſylvania, where
I expect to meet Waſhington, but if he goes to the northward contrary to my
expectations, and you can keep him at bay, be aſſured I ſhall ſoon be
after him to relieve you.</p>
                        <p>After your arrival at Albany, the movements of the enemy will
guide yours; but my wiſhes are, that the enemy be drove out of this province
before any operation takes place in Connecticut. Sir Henry Clinton remains in
the command here, and will act as occurences my direct. Putnam is in the

                     <p>I TAKE the liberty of informing your Excellency, that there has
yet been no arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made for marching the field artillery by land,
ſhould the corps of troops upon an expedition under your command in the
courſe of the campaign quit the lakes Champlain and George, and the
rivers.</p>
                     <p>I have, upon the ſtricteſt information which could be
procured, reaſon to believe, that neither carriages nor horſes will be to
be had nearer than Albany, ſhould the route of your army be that way, and
even in that country, it will neceſſarily require a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time
before any can be got; all which muſt neceſſarily delay the operations of
the campaign, after the reduction of Ticonderoga. I therefore ſubmit to your
Excellency's conſideration whether horſes and ſuch ammunition-carriages
as may be wanted ſhould not be procured for the ſervice of the campaign,
for the field artillery attached to the corps of troops your Excellency is to
command this campaign?</p>

                        <p>I HAVE the honour of your Excellency's letter to me of
yeſterday, in anſwer to one I wrote on the ſubject of the field-artillery
being ſupplied with horſes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>You are pleaſed, Sir, to order me to give an opinion upon
the mode of procuring horſes and carriages from this country, combining the
conſideration of diſpatch, ſufficiency, and oeconomy towards
government.</p>
                        <p>There are but two modes of procuring horſes for the
ſervice, ſuppoſing the country is not to furniſh them upon
Corvées, the one is by purchaſing of horſes upon the account of
government, the other by contract.</p>
                        <p>The firſt of theſe modes has always appeared to me
difficult, uncertain, and full of openings for every ſpecies of impoſition,
and the expence uncertain.—Government muſt truſt various people to
buy horſes, and in this country it will not be poſſible to procure any
perſons who will not immediately purſue the views of gaining money to
themſelves with a conſideration for the King's ſervice. Add to this, that
it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch a charge, that many commiſſaries muſt be
appointed, and various other officers of that ſort, &amp;c, which being a
mixture of inſpectors into the purchaſes of horſes, and neceſſarily
alſo at times the being purchaſers, it will be difficult ever to
aſcertain the price, and ſeldom that the goodneſs of horſes can be
depended on.</p>
                        <p>I have ſeen in my ſervice this mode attempted, but it has
to my knowledge failed. I muſt allow, that could it be carried into execution
complete, it would be the cheapeſt for government: but taking into
conſideration the various impoſitions which will ariſe, and that the
ſetting out on a plan of this nature will require a very large ſum of
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:0652302600:176"/> perhaps from 20,000l. to 30,000l. to be
intruſted into various hands, I freely give it as my opinion that it is not a
perfect plan. The contracting for a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of horſes at a fixed
price for the hire by day reduces the whole to a very ſimple, and therefore
generally a certain plan. It depends in the ſetting out, by making as cheap,
as fair, and juſt a bargain on the part of government as can be. And being
ſo made, that the military and civil officers do their duty, by attending to
the receiving of horſes only as they are fitting for ſervice. The
contractor has his intereſt ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly connected with fulfilling his
contract, as upon failure it ceaſes, that he will exert all means to do it,
and the care of government will be that it be done honeſtly and
compleatly.</p>
                        <p>I have thus obeyed your Excellency's orders, and given an
opinion which I ſubmit entirely to your conſideration.</p>

                        <p>HAVING had the honor to repreſent to your Excellency the
neceſſity of being provided with a certain number of horſes and carriages
for the artillery, victual, and other indiſpenſible purpoſes of the army,
when it ſhall be obliged to quit the borders of the lakes and rivers; and
having underſtood from your Excellency that ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion could not be
made by the ordinary methods of covée, and that if propoſed without
compulſion upon the country the effect would be precarious, dilatory, and
expenſive; I have the honour now to lay before your Excellency propoſals
for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts for an expeditious ſupply of horſes for the artillery, and
500 carts, with two horſes each, for the other purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>I am too ignorant of the prices of the country to offer any
judgment upon the reaſonableneſs of theſe propoſals; nor have I any
long acquaintance with Mr. Jordan, or other motive for wiſhing him the
preference, if other perſons can be found equally capable, reſponſible,
and expeditious. I have only thus far interfered, upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, after
conſidering the route the King's orders direct, and taking all poſſible
methods of information upon the ſupply to be expected as we proceed, that to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the country altogether would be to hazard the expedition.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency will obſerve, that in order to ſave the
public expence as much as poſſible, I have reduced this requiſition much
below what would be adequate to the ſervice, and I mean to truſt to the
reſources of the expedition for the reſt; 500 carts will barely carry
fourteen days proviſions at a time, and Major General Phillips means 
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:0652302600:177"/> to demand as few horſes as poſſible, ſubject to
whatever future augmentations future ſervices may require; the preſent
number wanted will be about 400; there will then remain unprovided for (for
expeditious movement) the tranſport of bateaux from Lake George to Hudſon's
River, and the carriage of the tents of the army, and many other contingencies
that I need not trouble your Excellency to point out to you.</p>

                        <p>YOU have permitted me, as formerly, to write to you
confidentially. I take the firſt conveyance to renew a correſpondence ſo
pleaſing and honourable to myſelf, and that may, in ſome caſes, become
beneficial to the public ſervice. It ſhall never be employed but to convey
truths, to do juſtice to facts and perſons, and to ſecure myſelf in the
continuance of an eſteem ſo valuable to me as yours againſt appearances
and miſrepreſentations.</p>
                        <p>I have reaſon to be exceedingly ſatisfied with all that
has been done, and with moſt things that are doing: exertions have been made
during the winter, which was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably favourable, in all the departments,
and preparations are very forward; thoſe that have been committed to the
directions of General Phillips have been executed with a diligence,
preciſion, and foreſight, that entitle him to the fulleſt praiſe. The
troops are in a ſtate of health almoſt unprecedented, and their ſpirits
and general improvement are equally objects of great pleaſure and promiſe.
To this agreeable repreſentation I have the happineſs to add, that Sir Guy
Carleton has received me and the orders I brought in a manner that, in my
opinion, does infinite honour to his public and private character.</p>
                        <p>That he ſhould have wiſhed for the lead in active and
important military operations, is very natural. That he thinks he has ſome
cauſe of reſentment for the general tenor of treatment he has received from
ſome of the miniſters is diſcernible; but neither his diſappointment
nor his perſonal feelings operate againſt his duty; and I am convinced he
means to forward the King's meaſures, entruſted to my hands, with all the
zeal he could have employed had they reſted in his own.</p>
                        <p>My intention is, during my advance to Ticonderoga, and ſiege
of that poſt, for a ſiege I apprehend it muſt be, to give all
poſſible jealouſy on the ſide of Connecticut. If I can by manoeuvre
make them ſuſpect that after the reduction of Ticonderoga my views are
pointed that way, it may make the Connecticut forces very cautious of leaving
their own frontiers, and much facilitate my progreſs to Albany. I mention
this intention only to Lord George and yourſelf, and I do it leſt from any
intelligence of my motions that may reach England indirectly, it ſhould be
ſuppoſed I have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf to be diverted from the main object of
my orders. The King and his Majeſty's miniſters may reſt aſſured that
whatever demonſtrations I may endeavour to impoſe upon the enemy, I ſhall
really make no movement that can procraſtinate my progreſs to Albany.</p>
                        <p>One thing more occurs. I had the ſurpriſe and
mortification to find a paper handed about at Montreal, publiſhing the whole
deſign of the campaign, almoſt as accurately as if it had been copied from
the Secretary of State's letter. My own cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:0652302600:178"/> has
been ſuch that not a man in my own family has been let into the ſecret. Sir
Guy Carleton's, I am confident, has been equal; I am therefore led to doubt
whether imprudence has not been committed from private letters from England,
and wiſh you would aſk my friend D'Oyley, to whom my very affectionate
compliments, whether there is any perſon within the line of miniſterial
communication that he can ſuſpect to be ſo unguarded? It is not of great
conſequence here, except as far as regards St. Leger's expedition; but ſuch
a trick may be of moſt prejudicial conſequence in other caſes, and
ſhould be guarded againſt.</p>

                        <p>I HAVE had to contend againſt wet weather that rendered the
roads almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable at the carrying places, and conſequently the
paſſage of the bateaux and exceedingly dilatory, beſides a great deal of
contrary wind. Indeed the combination of land and water movement, bad roads,
inactivity and ſometimes diſobedience in the country, and a thouſand
other difficulties and accidents, unknown in other ſervices, diſconcert all
arrangements. I do not mention this upon my own account, as I do not hold
myſelf reſponſible for delays within the province of Canada; but I
mention it to do juſtice to others, who, I really think, have infinite merit
in overcoming the obſtructions we have met with, and who ought to be
juſtified againſt ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of yours and mine, who travel
acroſs a map very faſt, and are very free in their comments, when others,
who have ten times their knowledge and reſources, do not anſwer their
predictions and expectations.</p>
                        <p>I have been exceedingly diſtreſſed in regard to the
brigadiers of this army. Sir Guy Carleton, the day I took leave of him, put
into my hands an extract of a letter from the Secretary at War, approving the
appointment of thoſe gentlemen, but obſerving, that whenever any of them
ſhould <hi>lead their brigades out of the province of Canada, in order to
join the troops under General Howe,</hi> there would be a neceſſity for
their command ceaſing as brigadiers, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Were this to be put in execution, according to the letter of
the order, and the geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical limits of Canada, and ſuppoſing Major
General Phillips at the ſame time to be employed ſolely in the artillery, I
ſhould find myſelf at the head of an army to undertake a ſiege, and
afterwards purſue objects of importance, and poſſibly of time, without a
ſingle intermediate Britiſh officer between the Lieutenant General,
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>pro tempore</hi> in chief, and a Lieutenant Colonel. It would
be prepoſterous and impertinent in me to ſay one word more to you as an
officer, upon the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of methodizing or conducting ſuch an
army with ſuch a total deficiency of ſtaff. Had Lord Barrington
condeſcended to have communicated his intentions to me in London, I think I
could have convinced him of the impropriety. As it is, I muſt conclude that
the ſpirit of the order goes only to prevent thoſe gentlemen bearing a
higher rank and pay than ſenior lieutenant colonels ſerving in the ſame
army; and that therefore there can be no fault in keeping it dormant till the
junction takes place. In other words, I look upon mine to be the Canada army
till ſuch time as I am in communication with General Howe, ſo as to make
part of his force, and conſequently <pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:0652302600:179"/> without
meaſuring degrees north and ſouth, that the arrangements made in Canada,
and approved of by the King, remain in force till that time.</p>
                        <p>I am perſuaded, my dear General, you will ſupport me in
this liberty, if ſuch it is to be called, not only as the abſolute order
and method of the ſervice depends upon it, but alſo to avoid to theſe
gentlemen, who have really great merit, the vexation and the ridicule of being
deprived of their rank and pay in the hour of that very ſervice, with a view
to which their appointment was originally made. I think I can anſwer, that
the junction made, and the reaſons for reverting to their former ranks,
become obvious, they will ſubmit to his Majeſty's pleaſure without a
murmur.</p>

                        <p>THE mere compliment of ſervice I have given to the troops in
orders, and in the relation deſigned for the Gazette, is not doing them
ſufficient juſtice. It is a duty in me further, through you, and I know I
ſhall impoſe a pleaſing taſk on you, to aſſure the King that their
behaviour is as uniformly good in the camp as in action.</p>
                        <p>After what I have publicly mentioned of Fraſer I am ſure I
need not preſs you in his favour. I cannot but feel confident in the hope
that his Majeſty's grace will find its way through all obſtacles to prevent
ſo diſcouraging a circumſtance as the return of this gallant officer to
the mere duty of lieutenant colonel, at the head of one batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, after
having given aſcendancy to the King's troops, and done honour to his
profeſſion, by the moſt ſpirited actions in critical periods of two
ſucceſſive cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns.</p>
                        <p>You will obſerve, Sir, both in the public letter and in the
order of battle, which Captain Gardner will put into your hands, that Major
General Phillips is occaſionally employed ſeparately from the ſtrict line
of his department. This does not proceed from inattention to the explanation of
his Majeſty's pleaſure two years ago; but from abſolute neceſſity.
The ſtaff being compoſed without any Britiſh major general, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier
Fraſer being poſted where he is of infinite uſe, at the head of the
advanced corps, the ſervice would ſuffer in the moſt material degree if
the talents of General Phillips were not ſuffered to extend beyond the limits
of the artillery, and I hold myſelf fully juſtified in continuing the great
uſe of his aſſiſtance under this extenſion, by what I underſtand to
be the ſignification of the King's pleaſure to Sir Guy Carleton, viz.
<hi>That this meaſure muſt not be made a precedent,</hi> but not forbidding
it during the preſent exigency.</p>
                        <p>I flatter myſelf the King will be ſatisfied with the
diligence uſed in taking the field, as well as with the ſubſequent
operations; if not, my diſappointment can only proceed from my own deficiency
in ſtating the embarraſſments I found, notwithſtanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
preparations and cordial aſſiſtances. Remote ſituations of the troops,
currents, winds, roads, want of materials for caulking the veſſels,
inactivity and deſertion of the Canadian corvées, were all againſt
me. A great difficulty lay in providing horſes and carriages for the bare
tranſport of proviſions and tents, when we ſhould arrive at Fort George,
or any other place where the army ſhould have no reſource of water
carriage. I found an active, and I think a reaſonable contractor, who
ſupplied this neceſſity at a much cheaper rate than it could have been
done any other way. <pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:0652302600:180"/> I incloſe a copy of the contract
to the treaſury, to which I refer you. You will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that I have
limited the number to the mere indiſpenſible purpoſes of proviſions and
tents, truſting to the country for the further aſſiſtance of officers
baggage and the other attirail of an army. Experience already ſhews me that I
judged right in not truſting to the country for more; for had this precaution
been omitted, I ſhould be bound faſt to the ſpot where I am, or obliged
to return by water to Ticonderoga.</p>
                        <p>I avow alſo to you my advice to General Carleton to grant
commiſſions to two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial battalions, to be raiſed from Albany and
Charlotte County, by a Mr. Jeſſup and a Mr. Peters, upon condition that the
commiſſions ſhould not take place till two thirds of the corps ſhould
be effective, provincial corps, acting zealouſly in the King's cauſe,
muſt have great impreſſion upon public opinion, and will, beſides, in
fact be of ſingular uſe to the eaſe and preſervation of the regular
troops.</p>
                        <p>Upon this principle, therefore, I have not heſitated further
to receive and to pay ſuch loyaliſts as have come in with their arms
ſince the ſucceſs of Ticonderoga, and wiſh to be employed. Though I
have not power to grant commiſſions, I poſt the officers, and form them
into companies till the meaſure can be decided by thoſe who have more
authority.</p>
                        <p>I hope all theſe articles of expence will meet with the
ſupport of your opinion; and have only to add, that as no job ſhall be done
myſelf, ſo will I uſe all efforts to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch being done by
others.</p>
                        <p>I am indiſpenſibly obliged to wait ſome time on this
poſition, to clear roads and make bridges, which is great labour in this
country, and to bring up a ſtock of proviſion, and alſo to give time to
the gun-boats, bateaux, and proviſion veſſels to be put into Lake George
to ſcour that lake, and ſecure the future route of the maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines. I
propoſe to poſſeſs Fort Edward at the ſame time that the force is
ready to move down the lake, by which means, if the enemy do not evacuate Fort
George, the garriſon muſt inevitably be caught. In the mean while I have
ordered Reideſel to make roads, reconnoitre the country, and make all other
poſſible feints of a march to the Connecticut, and by ſome other
meaſures I hope to give alarms that way.</p>

                        <p>IN conſequence of your Excellency's orders I moved this
morning at four o'clock, with the corps under my command; and after a march of
ſixteen miles arrived at Cambridge at four in the evening. On the road I
received intelligence of forty or fifty of the rebels being left to guard
ſome cattle. I immediately ordered thirty of the provincials and fifty
ſavages to quicken their march, in hopes to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them. They took five
priſoners in arms, who declared themſelves to be in the ſervice of the
Congreſs; yet the enemy received advice of our approach, and abandoned the
houſe they were poſted in. The provincials and ſavages continued their
march about a mile, when they fell in with a party of fifteen men, who fired
upon our people, and immediately took to the woods with the greateſt
precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The fire was quick on our ſide, but I cannot learn if the
enemy ſuſtained any loſs. A private of Captain Sherwood's company was the
only one who was ſlightly wounded in the thigh. From the many people who came
from Benning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton they agree that the number of the enemy amounted to 1800. I
will be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly careful, on my approach at that place, to be fully
informed of their ſtrength and ſituation, and take the precautions
neceſſary to fulfil both the orders and inſtructions of your
Excellency.</p>
                        <p>I cannot aſcertain the number of cattle, carts, and waggons
taken here, as they have not been as yet collected. A few horſes have been
alſo brought in, but am ſorry to acquaint your Excellency that the
ſavages either deſtroy or drive away what is not paid for with ready money.
If your Excellency would allow me to purchaſe the horſes from the
ſavages, ſtipulating the price, I think they might be procured cheap,
otherwiſe they ruin all they meet with, their officers and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not
having it in their power to controul them. Your Excellency may depend

                        <p>I have the honour to inform your excellency, that I arrived
here at eight in the morning, having had intelligence of a party of the enemy
being in poſſeſſion of a mill, which they abandoned at our approach,
but in their uſual way fired from the buſhes, and took their road to
Bennington; a ſavage was ſlightly wounded; they broke down the bridge which
has retarded our march above an hour, they left in the mill about
ſeventy-eight barrels of very fine flour, 1000 buſhels of wheat, 20 barrels
of ſalt, and about 1000l. worth pearl and pot aſh. I have ordered thirty
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials and an officer to guard the proviſion and the paſs of the
bridge. By five pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners taken here, they agree that 1500 to 1800 men are
in Bennington, but are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to leave it on our approach; I will
proceed ſo far to-day as to fall on the the enemy to-morrow early, and make
ſuch diſpoſition as I think neceſſary from the intelligence I may
receive. People are flocking in hourly, but want to be armed; the ſavages
cannot be controuled, they ruin and take every thing they pleaſe.</p>

Colonel Baume, upon an expedition of which he has the command, and which will
march this evening, or to-morrow morning.</p>
                        <p>The objects of his orders are to try the affections of the
country; to diſconcert the councils of the enemy; to mount the regiment of
Reideſel dragoons; to compleat Lieutenant Colonel Peters's corps, and to
procure a large ſupply of horſes for the uſe of the troops, together with

                        <head>Extract of a Letter from Lieutenant General
<hi>Burgoyne,</hi> to Sir <hi>Guy Carleton,</hi> dated Head-Quarters, at
Skeneſborough Houſe, 11th July, 1777.</head>
                        <p>I REQUEST your Excellency to take into conſideration the
expediency of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Canada, a garriſon for Ticonderoga.</p>
                        <p>My communication will widen ſo much as I proceed, the drain
upon the army for poſts will be ſo conſiderable, not to ſpeak of
detachments and ſafe-guards to protect and to awe the country, that if that
firſt diminution is not replaced, my effective ſtrength may become
inadequate to the ſervices intended. My preſent intelligence is that Putnam
is collecting an army to oppoſe me at Saratoga. Fort Edward is alſo talked
of to ſuſtain a ſiege.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will, I am ſure, agree with me that
Ticonderoga, or ſome other fortified poſt on the South part of Lake
Champlain, ought to be conſidered on the frontiers of the province of Canada.
I am aware of the difficulties that ariſe from the manner in which the
Secretary of State's orders are penned; but I ſubmit to your Excellency,
whether, under the principle laid down in the beginning of the order, and
afterwards repeated, <hi>that</hi> 3000 <hi>men were held ſufficient for the
defence of that province,</hi> you would not be juſtified in ſparing for
the purpoſe of this garriſon, the overplus of the 3000 that may remain
after compleating my army.</p>
                        <p>And notwithſtanding the corps for the Canada ſervice are
preciſely named by the Secretary of State, I would further ſubmit whether,
upon my preſſing requiſition, the garriſon might not juſtifiably be
furniſhed by detachment, even though there was no overplus, under the
following words of the order; <hi>after haviug ſecured to him,</hi>
(Lieutenant General Burgoyne) <hi>every aſſiſtance which it is in your
power to afford and procure.</hi> Your Excellency's zeal for the ſervice and
favour towards me, will be better interpreters for the latitude I propoſe,
than any thing I can further ſuggeſt; my preſent purpoſe, Sir, is to
get a ſufficient number of gun-boats upon the Lake George to ſcour that
lake as expeditiouſly as poſſible, to ſupport them with a proper force
to attack Fort George on that ſide, while with the main of the army as ſoon
as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and ſupplied, I attack Fort Edward from hence, and therebycut
off the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from Albany to Fort George, and conſequently prevent
the ſuccour or retreat of that garriſon.</p>

                        <head>Extract of a Letter from Lieutenant General
<hi>Burgoyne,</hi> to Sir <hi>Guy Carleton,</hi> Head-Quarters, near Fort Anne,
July 29th 1777.</head>
                        <p>THE conſtruction your excellency puts upon the orders of the
Secretary of State, is too full and deciſive for me to preſume to trouble
you further upon the ſubject of a garriſon for Ticonderoga from Canada, I
muſt do as well as I can, but I am ſure your Excellency, as a ſoldier,
will think my ſituation a little difficult. A breach into my communication
muſt either ruin my army entirely, or oblige me to return in force to
reſtore, which might be the loſs of the campaign. To prevent a breach,
Ticonderoga and Fort George muſt be in very reſpectable ſtrength, and I
muſt beſides have poſts at Fort Edward and other carrying-places. Theſe
drains added to common accidents and loſſes of ſervice, will
neceſſarily render me very inferior in <pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:0652302600:189"/> point of
numbers to the enemy, whom I muſt expect always to find ſtrongly poſted.
I aſk pardon for dwelling ſo much upon this ſubject, and have only to add
my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to your Excellency to forward the additional companies as
expeditiouſly as may be.</p>

                        <p>THE accounts you have ſent me are very ſatisfactory, and I

                        <p>I beg the favour of you to report whether the road you have
paſſed is practicable, and if ſo, if it is convenient for a
conſiderable corps with cannon.</p>
                        <p>Should you find the enemy too ſtrongly poſted at
Bennington, and maintaining ſuch a countenance as may make an attack
imprudent, I wiſh you to take a poſt where you can maintain yourſelf till
you receive an anſwer from me, and I will either ſupport you in force, or
withdraw you.</p>

                     <p>A MINUTE detail of every operation ſince my leaving La Chine,
with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment entruſted to my care, your Excellency will permit me to
reſerve to a time of leſs hurry and mortification than the preſent, while
I enter into the intereſting ſcene before Fort Stanwix, which I inveſted
the 3d of Auguſt, having previouſly puſhed forward Lieutenant Bird of the
King's reigment, with thirty of the King's troops and two hundred Indians,
under the direction of Captains Hare and Wilſon, and the chiefs Joſeph and
Bull, to ſeize faſt hold of the lower landing-place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cut off
the enemy's communication with the lower country.—This was done with
great addreſs by the lieutenant, though not attended with the effect I had
promiſed myſelf, occaſioned by the ſlackneſs of the
Meſſaſagoes. The brigade of proviſion and ammunition boats I had
intelligence of, being arrived and diſembarked before this party had taken
poſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="lxiv" facs="tcp:0652302600:190"/> The fourth and fifth were employed in
making arrangements for opening Wood Creek (which the enemy, with the
indefatigable labour of one hundred and fifty men, for fourteen days, had
moſt effectually choaked up) and the making a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary road from Pine
Ridges upon Fiſh Creek, ſixteen miles from the fort, for a preſent
ſupply of proviſion and the tranſport of our artillery: the firſt was
effected by the diligence and zeal of Captain Bouville, aſſiſted by
Captain Harkimer of the Indian department, with one hundred and ten men, in
nine days; while Lieutenant Lundy, acting as aſſiſtant quarter-maſter
general, had rendered the road in the worſt of weather, ſufficiently
practicable to paſs the whole artillery and ſtores, with ſeven days
proviſion, in two days.</p>
                     <p>On the 5th, in the evening, intelligence arrived by my
diſcovering parties on the Mohawk River, that a reinforcement of eight
hundred militia, conducted by General Herkimer, were on their march to relieve
the garriſon, and were actually at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant at Oriſka, an Indian
ſettlement, twelve miles from the fort. The garriſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appriſed of
their march by four men, who were ſeen enter the fort in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
through what was thought an impenetrable ſwamp, I did not think it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to wait for them, and thereby ſubject myſelf to be attacked by a ſally
from the garriſon in the rear, while the reinforcement employed me in front.
I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to attack them on the march, either openly or covertly,
as circumſtances ſhould offer. At this time, I had not two hundred and
fifty of the King's troops in camp; the various and extenſive operations I
was under an abſolute neceſſity of entering into, having employed the
reſt; and therefore, could not ſend above eighty white men, rangers and
troops included, with the whole corps of Indians. Sir John Johnſon put
himſelf at the head of this party, and began his march that evening at five
o'clock, and met the rebel corps at the ſame hour the next morning. The
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of the Indians is not to be deſcribed on the ſight of the
enemy (forgetting the judicious diſpoſition formed by Sir John, and agreed
to by themſelves, which was, to ſuffer the attack to begin with the troops
in front, while they ſhould be on both flanks and rear) they ruſhed in,
hatchet in hand, and thereby gave the enemy's rear an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to eſcape.
In relation to the victory, it was equally complete, as if the whole had
fallen; nay more ſo, as the two hundred who eſcaped only ſerved to
ſpread the panic wider; but it was not ſo with the Indians; their loſs
was great (I muſt be underſtood Indian computation, being only about thirty
killed, and the like number wounded, and in that number ſome of their
favourite chiefs and confidential warriors were ſlain.) On the enemy's
ſide, almoſt all their principal leaders were ſlain. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Herkimer
has ſince died of his wounds. It is proper to mention, that the four men
detached with intelligence of the march of the reinforcement, ſet out the
evening before the action, and conſequently the enemy could have no account
of the defeat, and were in poſſeſſion only, of the time appointed for
their arrival; at which, as I ſuſpected, they made a ſally with two
hundred and fifty men towards Lieutenant Bird's poſt, to facilitate the
entrance of the relieving corps, or bring on a general en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, with every
advantage they could wiſh.</p>
                     <p>Captain Hoyes was immediately detached to cut in upon their
rear, while they engaged the lieutenant. Immediately upon the departure of
Captain Hoyes, having learned that Lieutenant Bird, miſled by the information
of a cowardly Indian, that Sir John was preſſed, had quitted his poſt to
march to his aſſiſtance, I marched <pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:0652302600:191"/> the
detachment of the King's regiment, in ſupport of Captain Hoyes, by a road in
ſight of the garriſon, which, with executive fire from his party,
immediately drove the enemy into the fort, without any further advantage than
frightening ſome ſquaws and pilfering the packs of the warriors which they
left behind them. After this affair was over, orders were immediately given to
compleat a two-gun battery, and mortar beds, with three ſtrong redoubts in
their rear, to enable me, in caſe of another attempt, to relieve the
garriſon by their regimented troops, to march out a larger body of the King's
troops.</p>
                     <p>Captain Lernoult was ſent with 110 men to the lower landing
place, where he eſtabliſhed himſelf with great judgment and ſtrength,
having an encloſed battery of a three-pounder oppoſed to any ſally from
the fort, and another to the ſide of the country, where a relief muſt
approach; and the body of his camp deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched and abbatiſed.</p>
                     <p>When by the unabating labour of officers and men (the
ſmallneſs of our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers never admitting of a relief, or above three hours
ceſſation for ſleep or cooking) the batteries and redoubts were
finiſhed, and new cheeks and axle-trees made for the ſix-pounders, thoſe
that were ſent being reported rotten and unſerviceable.</p>
                     <p>It was found that our cannon had not the leaſt effect upon the
ſod-work of the fort, and that our royals had only the power of teizing, as a
ſix-inch plank was a ſufficient ſecurity for their powder magazine, as we
learnt from the deſerters. At this time Lieutenant Glenie of the artillery,
whom I had appointed to act as aſſiſtant engineer, propoſed a
converſion of the royals (if I may uſe the expreſſion) into howitzers.
The ingenuity and feaſability of this meaſure ſtriking me very
ſtrongly, the buſineſs was ſet about immediately, and ſoon executed,
when it was found that nothing prevented their operating with the deſired
effect but the diſtance, their chambers being too ſmall to hold a
ſufficiency of powder. There was nothing now to be done but to approach the
town by ſap to ſuch a diſtance that the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part might be brought within
their portice, at the ſame time all materials were preparing to run a mine
under their moſt formidable baſtion.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of theſe operations intelligence was brought in
by our ſcouts, of a ſecond corps of 1000 men being on their march. The
ſame zeal no longer animated the Indians; they complained of our thinneſs
of troops and their former loſſes. I immediately called a council of the
chiefs; encouraged them as much as I could; promiſed to lead them on
myſelf, and bring into the field 300 of the beſt troops. They liſtened to
this, and promiſed to follow me, and agreed that I ſhould recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre the
ground propereſt for the field of battle the next morning, accompanied by
ſome of their chief warriors, to ſettle the plan of operations. When upon
the ground appointed for the field of battle, ſcouts came in with the account
of the firſt number ſwelled to 2000; immediately after a third, that
General Burgoyne's army was cut to pieces, and that Arnold was advancing, by
rapid and forced marches, with 3000 men. It was at this moment I began to
ſuſpect cowardice in ſome, and treaſon in others; however I returned to
camp, not without hopes, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of my gallant coadjutor,
Sir John Johnſon, and the influence of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending colonels, Claus
and Butler, of inducing them to meet the enemy. A council, according to their
cuſtom, was called, to know their reſolutions, before the breaking up of
which I learned that 200 were already decamped. In about an hour 
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:0652302600:192"/> they inſiſted that I ſhould retreat, or they
would be obliged to abandon me. I had no other party to take, and a hard party
it was to troops who could do nothing without them, to yield to their
reſolves; and therefore propoſed to retire at night, ſending on before my
ſick, wounded, artillery, &amp;c. down the Wood Creek, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them by our
line of march.</p>
                     <p>This did not fall in with their views, which were no leſs than
treacherouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ravage upon their friends, as they had loſt the
opportunity of doing it upon their enemies. To effect this they artfully
cauſed meſſengers to come in, one after the other, with accounts of the
nearer approaches of the rebels; one and the laſt affirmed that they were
within two miles of Captain Lernoult's poſt. Not giving entire credit to
this, and keeping to my reſolution of retiring by night, they grew furious
and abandoned; ſeized upon the officers' liquor and cloaths, in ſpite of
the efforts of their ſervants; and became more formidable than the enemy we
had to expect. I now thought it time to call in Captain Lernoult's poſt,
retiring with the troops in camp to the ruined fort called William, in the
front of the garriſon, not only to wait the enemy, if they thought proper to
ſally, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the boats from the fury of the ſavages, having
ſent forward Captain Hoyes, with his detachment, with one piece of cannon, to
the place where Bull Fort ſtood, to receive the troops who waited the arrival
of Captain Lernoult. Moſt of the boats were eſcorted that night beyond
Canada Creek, where no danger was to be apprehended from the enemy. The creek
at this place bending from the road, has a deep cedar ſwamp between. Every
attention was now turned to the mouth of the creek, which the enemy might have
poſſeſſed themſelves of by a rapid march by the Oneyda Caſtle. At
this place the whole of the little army arrived by twelve o'clock at night, and
took poſt in ſuch a manner as to have no fears of any thing the enemy could
do. Here we remained till three o'clock next morning, when the boats which
could come up the Creek arrived, or rather that the raſcally part of all
nations of the Indians would ſuffer to come up; and proceeded acroſs Lake
Oneyda to the ruined fort of Brereton, where I learnt that ſome boats were
ſtill labouring down the creek, after being lightened of the beſt part of
their freight by the Meſſaſagoes. Captain Lernoult propoſed, with a
boat full of armed men, to repaſs the lake that night, to relieve them from
their labour, and ſupply them with proviſion. This tranſaction does as
much honour to the humanity as to the gallantry of this valuable officer.</p>
                     <p>On my arrival at the Onondago Falls I received an anſwer to my
letter from your Excellency, which ſhewed, in the cleareſt light, the
ſcenes of treachery that had been practiſed upon me. The meſſenger had
heard indeed on his way that they were collecting the ſame kind of rabble as
before, but that there was not an enemy within forty miles of Fort Stanwix.</p>
                     <p>Soon after my arrival here I was joined by Captain Lernoult,
with the men and boats he had been in ſearch of. I mean immediately to ſend
off, for the uſe of the upper garriſon, all the overplus proviſion I
ſhall have, after keeping a ſufficiency to carry my detachment down, which
I mean to do with every expedition in my power the moment this buſineſs is
effected, for which purpoſe I have ordered here the ſnow. The ſloop is
already gone from this with her full lading.</p>

join your army.</p>

toil, inceſſant effort, ſtubborn action; till diſabled in the
collateral branches of the army by the total defection of the Indians; the
deſertion or timidity of the Canadians and Provincials, ſome individuals
excepted; diſappointed in the laſt hope of any timely co-operation from
other armies; the regular troops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by loſſes from the beſt part to
3500 fighting men, not 2000 of which were Britiſh; only three days
proviſions upon ſhort allowance in ſtore; inveſted by an army of 16,000
men, and no apparent means of retreat remaining, I called into council all the
generals, field officers, and captains commanding corps, and by their unanimous
concurrence and advice, I was induced to open a treaty with Major General
Gates.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordſhip will ſee, by the papers tranſmitted

inſtead of ſubmitting, will not be refuſed a ſhare of credit.</p>
                        <p>Before I enter upon the detail of theſe events, I think it a

did not think myſelf authoriſed to call any men into council, when the

ravine, and other roads towards the enemy, having been reconnoitred, the army
advanced in the following order.</p>
                        <p>Brigadier General Fraſer's corps, ſuſtained by
Lieutenant Colonel Breyman's corps, made a circuit, in order to paſs the
ravine commodiouſly, without quitting the heights, and afterwards to cover
the march of the line to the right. Theſe corps moved in three columns, and
had the Indians, Canadians, and Provincials upon their fronts and flanks. The
Britiſh line led by me in perſon paſſed the ravine in a direct line
ſouth, and formed in order of battle as faſt as they gained the ſummit,
where they waited to give time to Fraſer's corps to make the circuit, and to
enable the left wing and artillery, which, under the commands of Major General
Phillips, and Major General Reideſel, kept the great road and meadows near
the river in two columns, and had bridges to repair, to be equally ready to
proceed. The 47th regiment guarded the bateaux.</p>
                        <p>The ſignal guns, which had been previouſly ſettled to
give notice of all the columns being ready to advance, having been fired
between one and two o'clock, the march continued. The ſcouts and flankers of
the column of the Britiſh line were ſoon fired upon from ſmall parties
but with no effect. After about an hour's march, the picquets, which made the
advanced guard of that column, were attacked in force, and obliged to give
ground, but they ſoon rallied and were ſuſtained.</p>
                        <p>On the firſt opening of the wood I formed the troops. A few
cannon-ſhot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged the enemy at a houſe from whence the picquets had
been attacked, and Brigadier General Fraſer's corps had arrived with ſuch
preciſion in point of time, as to be found upon a very advantageous height on
the right of the Britiſh.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the enemy, not acquainted with the
combination of the march, had moved in great force out of their intrenchments,
with a view of turning the line upon the right, and being checked by the
diſpoſition of Brigadier General Fraſer, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marched, in order to
direct their great effort to the left of the Britiſh.</p>
                        <p>From the nature of the country, movements of this ſort,
however near, may be effected without a poſſibility of their being
diſcovered.</p>
                        <p>About three o'clock the action began by a very vigorous attack
on the Britiſh line, and continued with great obſtinacy till after
ſunſet. The enemy being continually ſupplied with freſh troops, the

                           </gap>2d regiments, moſt parts of which
were engaged near four hours without intermiſſion; the 9th had been ordered
early in the day to form in reſerve.</p>
                        <p>The grenadiers and 24th regiment were ſome part of the time
brought into action, as were part of the light infantry, and all theſe corps
charged with their uſual ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>The riflemen, and other parts of Breyman's corps, were alſo
of ſervice; but it was not thought adviſable to evacuate the heights where
Brigadier General Fraſer was poſted otherwiſe than partially and
occaſionally.</p>
                        <p>Major General Phillips upon firſt hearing the firing found
his way through a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult part of the wood to the ſcene of action, and
brought up with him Major Williams and four pieces of artillery, and from that
moment I ſtood indebted to that gallant and judicious ſecond, for
inceſſant and moſt material ſervices, particularly for reſtoring the
action in a point which was critically preſſed by a great ſuperiority of
fire, and to which he led up the 20th regiment at the utmoſt perſonal
hazard.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:0652302600:195"/> Major-General Riedeſel exerted
himſelf to bring up a part of the left wing, and arrived in time to charge
the enemy with regularity and bravery.</p>
                        <p>Juſt as the light cloſed, the enemy gave ground on all
ſides, and left us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely maſters of the field of battle, with the
loſs of about five hundred men on their ſide, and, as ſuppoſed, thrice
that number wounded.</p>
                        <p>The darkneſs preventing a purſuit, the priſoners were
few.</p>
                        <p>The behaviour of the officers and men in general was
exemplary. Brigadier-General Fraſer took his poſition in the beginning of
the day with great judgment, and ſuſtained the action with conſtant
preſence of mind and vigour. Brigadier-General Hamilton was the whole time
engaged and acquitted himſelf with great honour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and good
conduct.</p>
                        <p>The artillery in general was diſtinguiſhed, and the
brigade under Captain Jones, who was killed in the action, was
conſpicuouſly ſo.</p>
                        <p>The army lay upon their arms the night of the 19th, and the
next day took a poſition nearly within cannon ſhot of the enemy, fortifying
their right, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their left to the brow of the heights, ſo as to
cover the meadows through which the great river runs, and where their bateaux
and hoſpitals were placed. The 47th regiment, the regiment of Heſſe
Hanau, and a corps of Provincials in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in the meadows as a further
ſecurity.</p>
                        <p>It was ſoon found that no fruits, honour excepted, were
attained by the preceding victory, the enemy working with redoubled ardor to
ſtrengthen their left: their right was already unattackable.</p>
                        <p>On our ſide it became expedient to erect ſtrong redoubts
for the protection of the magazines and hoſpital, not only againſt a
ſudden attack, but alſo for their ſecurity in caſe of a march to turn
the enemy's flank.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">September 21.</note>A meſſenger arrived
from Sir Harry Clinton with a letter in cypher, informing me of his intention
to attack Fort Montgomery in about ten days from the date of his letter, which
was the 12th inſtant. This was the only meſſenger of many that I
apprehend were diſpatched by Sir William Howe, and him that had reached my
camp ſince the beginning of Auguſt. He was ſent back the ſame night to
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Sir Harry of my ſituation, and of the neceſſity of a diverſion
to oblige General Gates to detach from his army, and my intention to wait
favourable events in that poſition, if poſſible, to the 12th of
October.</p>
                        <p>In the courſe of the two following days, two officers in
diſguiſe, and other confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential perſons, were diſpatched by different
routes with verbal meſſages to the ſame effect, and I continued
fortifying my camp and watching the enemy, whoſe numbers increaſed every
day.</p>
                        <p>I thought it adviſable on the 3d of October to diminiſh
the ſoldiers' ration in order to lengthen out the proviſions, to which
meaſure the army ſubmitted with the utmoſt chearfulneſs. The
difficulties of a retreat to Canada were clearly foreſeen, as was the
dilemma, ſhould the retreat be effected, of leaving at liberty ſuch an army
as General Gates's to operate againſt Sir William Howe.</p>
                        <p>This conſideration operated forcibly to determine me to
abide events as long as poſſible, and I reaſoned thus. The expedition I
commanded was evidently meant at firſt to be <hi>hazarded.</hi>
Circumſtances might require it ſhould be <hi>devoted.</hi> A critical
junction of Mr. Gates's force with Mr. Waſhington might poſſibly decide
the fate <pb n="l" facs="tcp:0652302600:196"/> of the war; the failure of my junction with Sir
Harry Clinton, or the loſs of my retreat to Canada could only be a partial
misfortune.</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation things continued till the ſeventh, when
no intelligence having been received of the expected co-operation, and four or
five days for our limited ſtay in the camp only remained, it was judged
adviſable to make a movement to the enemy's left, not only to diſcover
whether there were any poſſible means of forcing a paſſage ſhould it
be neceſſary to advance, or of diſlodging him for the convenience of a
retreat, but alſo to cover a forage of the army which was in the greateſt
diſtreſs on accouut of the ſcarcity.</p>
                        <p>A detachment of fifteen hundred regular troops with two twelve
pounders, two howitzers, and ſix ſix-pounders, were ordered to move, and
were commanded by myſelf, having with me Major-General Phillips,
Major-General Reideſel, and Brigadier-General Fraſer.</p>
                        <p>The guard of the camp upon the heights was left to
Brigadier-General Hamilton and Specht, the redoubts and the plain to Brigadier
General Gall; and as the force of the enemy immediately in their front
conſiſted of more than double their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it was not poſſible to
augment the corps that marched, beyond the numbers above ſtated.</p>
                        <p>I formed the troops within three-quarters of a mile of the
enemy's left, and Captain Fraſer's rangers, with Indians and Provincials, had
orders to go by ſecret paths in the woods to gain the enemy's rear, and by
ſhewing themſelves there to keep them in a check.</p>
                        <p>The further operations intended, were prevented by a very
ſudden and rapid attack of the enemy on our left, where the Britiſh
grenadiers were poſted to ſupport the left wing of the line. Major Acland
at the head of them ſuſtained the attack with great reſolution; but the
enemy's great numbers enabling them in a few minutes to extend the attack along
the front of the Germans, which were immediately on the right of the
grenadiers, no part of that body could be removed to make a ſecond line to
the flank, where the ſtreſs of the fire lay. The right was at this time
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, but it was ſoon obſerved that the enemy were marching a large
corps round their flank to endeavour cutting off their retreat. The light
infantry and part of the 24th regiment which were at that poſt were therefore
ordered to form a ſecond line, and to ſecure the return of the troops into
camp. While this movement was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the enemy puſhed a freſh and
ſtrong reinforcement to renew the action upon the left, which, overpowered by
a great ſuperiority, gave way, and the light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry and 24th regiment were
obliged to make a quick movement to ſave that point from being entirely
carried, in doing which, Brigadier-General Fraſer was mortally wounded.</p>
                        <p>The danger to which the lines were expoſed becoming at this
moment of the moſt ſerious nature, orders were given to Major-General
Phillips and Reideſel to cover the retreat, while ſuch troops as were
moſt ready for the purpoſe, returned for the defence of them. The troops
retreated hard preſſed, but in good order; they were obliged to leave ſix
pieces of cannon, all the horſes having been killed, and moſt of the
artillery-men, who had behaved as uſual with the utmoſt bravery under the
command of Major Williams, being either killed or wounded.</p>
                        <p>The troops had ſcarcely entered the camp when it was
ſtormed with great fury, the enemy ruſhing to the lines under a ſevere
fire of grape-ſhot and ſmall arms. <pb n="li" facs="tcp:0652302600:197"/> The poſt of the
light infantry under Lord Balcarras aſſiſted by ſome of the line, which
threw themſelves by order into the intrenchments, was defended with great
ſpirit, and the enemy led on by General Arnold was finally repulſed, and
the General wounded; but unhappily the intrenchments of the German reſerve,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Breymann, who was killed, were carried, and
although ordered to be recovered, they never were ſo, and the enemy by that
misfortune gained an opening on our right and rear. The night put an end to the
action.</p>
                        <p>Under the diſadvantages thus apparent in our ſituation,
the army was ordered to quit the preſent poſition during the night and take
poſt upon the heights above the hoſpital.</p>
                        <p>Thus by an entire change of front, to reduce the enemy to form
a new diſpoſition. This movement was effected in great order and without
loſs, though all the artillery and camp were removed at the ſame time. The
army continued offering battle to the enemy in their new poſition the whole
day of the 8th.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence was now received that the enemy were marching to
turn the right, and no means could prevent that meaſure but retiring towards
Saratoga. The army began to move at nine o'clock at night, Major-General
Reideſel commanding the van-guard, and Major-General Phillips the rear.</p>
                        <p>This retreat, though within muſquet-ſhot of the enemy, and
encumbered with all the baggage of the army, was made without loſs, but a
very heavy rain and the difficulties of guarding the bateaux which contained
all the proviſions, occaſioned delays which prevented the army reaching
Saratoga till the night of the 9th, and the artillery could not paſs the
fords of the Fiſh-kill till the morning of the 10th.</p>
                        <p>At our arrival near Saratoga, a corps of the enemy, between
five and ſix hundred, were diſcovered throwing up intrenchments on the
heights, but retired over a ford of the Hudſon's River at our approach, and
joined a body poſted to oppoſe our paſſage there.</p>
                        <p>It was judged proper to ſend a detachment of artificers
under a ſtrong eſcort to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the bridges and open a road to Fort-Edward
on the weſt ſide of the river. The 47th regiment, Captain Fraſer's
markſmen, and Mackoy's Provincials, were ordered for that ſervice, but the
enemy appearing on the heights of the Fiſh-kill in great force, and making a
diſpoſition to paſs and give us battle: the 47th regiment and Fraſer's
markſmen were recalled; the Provincials left to cover the workmen at the
firſt bridge run away upon a very ſlight attack of a ſmall party of the
enemy, and left the artificers to eſcape as they could, without a
poſſibility of their performing any work.</p>
                        <p>During theſe different movements the bateaux with
proviſions were frequently fired upon from the oppoſite ſide of the
river, and ſome of them were loſt, and ſeveral men were killed and
wounded in thoſe which remained.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">October 11.</note>The attacks upon the
bateaux were continued, ſeveral were taken and retaken, but their ſituation
being much nearer to the main force of the enemy than to ours, it was found
impoſſible to ſecure the proviſions any otherwiſe than by landing
them and carrying them upon the hill: this was effected under fire, and with
great difficulty.</p>
                        <p>The poſſible means of further retreat were now
conſidered in councils of war, compoſed of the general officers, minutes of
which will be tranſmitted to your Lordſhip.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="lii" facs="tcp:0652302600:198"/> The only one that ſeemed at all
practicable was, by a night march to gain Fort-Edward with the troops carrying
their proviſion upon their backs; the impoſſibility of repairing bridges,
putting a conveyance of artillery and carriages out of the queſtion, it was
propoſed to force the ford at Fort-Edward, or the ford above it. Before this
attempt could be made, ſcouts returned with intelligence that the enemy were
intrenched oppoſite theſe fords, and poſſeſſed a camp in force on
the high ground between Fort-Edward and Fort-George with cannon. They had
alſo parties down the whole ſhore to watch our motions, and poſts ſo
near to us, upon our own ſide of the water as muſt prevent the army moving
a ſingle mile undiſcovered.</p>
                        <p>The bulk of the enemy's army was hourly joined by new corps of
militia and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, and their numbers together amounted to upwards of
16,000 men. Their poſition, which extended three parts in four of a circle
round us, was from the nature of the ground unattackable in all parts.</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation the army took the beſt poſition
poſſible and fortified, waiting till the 13th at night, in the anxious hope
of ſuccours from our friends, or the next deſirable expectation, an attack
from our enemy.</p>
                        <p>During this time the men lay continually upon their arms, and
were cannonaded in every part, even rifle-ſhot and grape-ſhot came into all
parts of the line, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable effect.</p>
                        <p>At this period an exact account of the proviſions was taken,
and the circumſtances ſtated in the opening of this letter became
compleat.</p>
                        <p>The council of war was extended to all the field officers and
captains commanding corps of the army, and the event enſued which I am ſure
was inevitable, and which, I truſt, in that ſituation was honourable, but
which it would be ſuperfluous and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly to repeat.</p>
                        <p>After the execution of the treaty, General Gates drew together
the force that had ſurrounded my poſition, and I had the conſolation to
have as many witneſſes as I have men under my command, of its amounting to
the numbers mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>During the events ſtated above, an attempt was made
againſt Ticonderoga by an army aſſembled under Major General Lincoln, who
found means to march with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable corps from Huberton undiſcovered,
while another column of his force paſſed the mountains between
Skeneſborough and Lake George, and on the morning of the 18th of September a
ſudden and general attack was made upon the carrying place at Lake George,
Sugar Hill, Ticonderoga, and Mount Independence. The ſea officers commanding
the armed ſloop ſtationed to defend the carrying place, as alſo ſome of
the officers commanding at the poſts of Sugar Hill and at the Portage were
ſurpriſed, and a conſiderable part of four companies of the 53d regiment
were made priſoners; a block-houſe, commanded by Lieutenant Lord of the
53d, was the only poſt on that ſide that had time to make uſe of their
arms, and they made a brave defence till cannon taken from the ſurpriſed
veſſel was brought againſt them.</p>
                        <p>After ſtating and lamenting ſo fatal a want of vigilance,
I have to inform your Lordſhip of the ſatisfactory events which
followed.</p>
                        <p>The enemy having twice ſummoned Brigadier General Powell,
and received ſuch anſwer as became a gallant officer entruſted with ſo
important a poſt, and having tried during the courſe of four days ſeveral
attacks, and being repulſed in all, retreated without having done any
conſiderable damage.</p>
                        <p>Brigadier General Powell, from whoſe report to me I extract
this relation, gives great commendations to the regiment of Prince Frederick,
and the other troops ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <pb n="liii" facs="tcp:0652302600:199"/> at Mount
Independence. The Brigadier alſo mentions with great applauſe the behaviour
of Captain Taylor of the 21ſt regiment, who was accidentally there on his
route to the army from the hoſpital, and Lieutenant Beecroft of the 24th
regiment, who with the artificers in arms defended an important battery.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th inſtant, the enemy, enabled by the capture of
the gun-boats and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaux which they had made after the ſurpriſe of the
ſloop, to embark upon Lake George, attacked Diamond Iſland in two
diviſions.</p>
                        <p>Captain Aubrey and two companies of the 47th regiment, had
been poſted at that iſland from the time the army paſſed the Hudſon's
River, as a better ſituation for the ſecurity of the ſtores at the
ſouth end of Lake George than Fort George, which is on the continent, and not
tenable againſt artillery and numbers, The enemy were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by Captain
Aubrey with great loſs, and purſued by the gun-boats under his command to
the eaſt ſhore, where two of their principal veſſels were retaken,
together with all the cannon. They had juſt time to ſet fire to the other
bateaux, and retreated over the mountains.</p>
                        <p>I beg leave to refer your Lordſhip for further particulars
to my aid-de-camp, Lord Peterſham, and I humbly take occaſion to recommend
to his Majeſty's notice that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, as one endued with qualities to do
important ſervices to his country in every ſtation to which his birth may
lead. In this late campaign in particular, his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has been ſuch as to
entitle him to the fulleſt applauſe, and I am confident his merit will be
thought a ſufficient ground for preferment, though deprived of the
<hi>eclat</hi> and ſort of claim which generally attends the delivery of
fortunate diſpatches.</p>
                        <p>I have only to add, my Lord, a general report of the killed
and wounded; I do not give it correct, the hurry of the time and the
ſeparation of the corps having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it impoſſible to make it ſo.
The Britiſh officers have bled profuſely and moſt honourably; thoſe who
remain unwounded have been equally forward, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral officers from the
mode of fighting have been more expoſed than in other ſervices. Among the
reſt of this ſtation, I have had my eſcapes. It depends upon the
ſentence his Majeſty ſhall paſs upon my conduct; upon the judgment of
my profeſſion, and of the impartial and reſpectable parts of my country,
whether I am to eſteem them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings or misfortunes.</p>

                        <p>I HAVE little to add to my public letter reſpecting the
courſe of unſucceſsful events, therein detailed. I reſt my confidence
in the juſtice of the King and his councils, to ſupport the General they
thought proper to appoint to as arduous an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and under as
poſitive a direction, as perhaps a cabinet ever framed. It will, I am ſure,
be remembered, my Lord, that a preference of exertions was the only latitude
given me, and that to force a junction with Sir William Howe, or at leaſt a
paſſage to Albany, was the principle, the letter, and the ſpirit of my
orders.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="liv" facs="tcp:0652302600:200"/> Indeed the appearances at the time I
paſſed the Hudſon's-River, though ſubject to doubt in ſome
inſtances, as I then wrote your Lordſhip, were upon a general view, ſuch
as I am perſuaded would have rendered inaction cenſurable, had my orders,
inſtead of being peremptory, been diſcretionary. Promiſes of the
profeſſing loyaliſts were not then brought to the teſt; the ſpirit of
the enemy, in combat againſt regular Britiſh troops, had only been tried at
Ticonderago, at Huberton, at Skeneſborough, and Fort Anne; in all which
places it had failed; the total diſappointment of effectual co-operation,
could not be foreſeen or ſuppoſed; and ſure I am, had I then made
ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that any thing like what has happened, might have happened,
and remained cautiouſly poſted, no exertion attempted, my conduct would
have been held indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by every claſs and diſtinction of men in
government, in the army, and in the public.</p>
                        <p>The expediency of advancing being admitted, the conſequences
have been honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable misfortunes. The Britiſh have perſevered in a
ſtrenuous and bloody pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Had the force been all Britiſh, perhaps
the perſeverance had been longer; but as it was, will it be ſaid, my Lord,
that in the exhauſted ſituation deſcribed, and in the jaws of famine, and
inveſted by quadruple numbers, a treaty which ſaves the army to the
ſtate, for the next campaign, was not more than could have been expected? I I
call it ſaving the army, becauſe if ſent home, the ſtate is thereby
enabled to ſend forth the troops now deſtined for her internal defence; if
exchanged, they become a force to Sir William Howe, as effectually, as if any
other junction had been made.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould now hold myſelf unjuſtifiable if I did not
confide to your Lordſhip, my opinion, upon a near inſpection, of the rebel
troops. The ſtanding corps which I have ſeen, are diſciplined. I do not
hazard the term, but apply it to the great funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points of military
inſtitution, ſobriety, ſubordination, regularity and courage. The militia
are inferior in method and movement, but not a jot leſs ſerviceable in
woods. My conjectures were very different after the affair of Ticonderago, but
I am convinced they were deluſive; and it is a duty to the ſtate to
confeſs it.</p>
                        <p>The panic of the rebel troops is confined, and of ſhort
duration; the enthuſiaſim is extenſive and permanent.</p>
                        <p>It is a juſtice to Major General Phillips, to inform your
Lordſhip, that when the criſis of our ſituation at Saratoga arrived, he
very handſomely offered to hazard his perſon by making a circuit through
the woods, and attempt to throw himſelf into Ticondera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, to defend that

                  </p>
                  <p>THE Lieutenant General ſtates to the council the preſent
ſituation of affairs.</p>
                  <p>The enemy in force, according to the beſt intelligence he can
obtain, to the amount of upwards of 14,000 men, and a conſiderable quantity
of artillery, are on this ſide the Fiſh-kill, and threaten an attack. On
the other ſide the Hudſon's River, between this army and Fort Edward, is
another army of the enemy, the numbers unknown; but one corps, which there has
been an opportunity of obſerving, is reported to be about 1500 men. They have
likewiſe cannon on the other ſide the Hudſon's River, and they have a
bridge below Saratoga church, by which the two armies can communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
                  <p>The bateaux of the army have been deſtroyed, and no means
appear of making a bridge over the Hudſon's River, were it even practicable
from the poſition of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>The only means of retreat, therefore, are by the ford at Fort
Edward, or taking the mountains in order to paſs the river higher up by
rafts, or by any other ford which is reported to be practicable with
difficulty, or by keeping the mountains, to paſs the head of Hudſon's
River, and continue to the weſtward of Lake George all the way to
Ticonderoga; it is true, this laſt paſſage was never made but by Indians,
or very ſmall bodies of men.</p>
                  <p>In order to paſs cannon or any wheel carriages from hence to
Fort Edward, ſome bridges muſt be repaired under fire of the enemy from the
oppoſite ſide of the river, and the principal bridge will be a work of
fourteen or fifteen hours; there is no good poſition for the army to take to
ſuſtain that work, and if there were, the time ſtated as neceſſary,
would give the enemy on the other ſide the Hudſon's River an opportunity to
take poſt on the ſtrong ground above Fort Edward, or to diſpute the ford
while General Gates's army followed in the rear.</p>
                  <p>The intelligence from the lower part of Hudſon's River is
founded upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current reports of priſoners and deſerters, who ſay
it was the news in the enemy's camp, that Fort Montgomery was taken; and one
man, a friend to government, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived yeſterday, mentions ſome
particulars of the manner in which it was taken.</p>
                  <p>The proviſions of the army may hold out to the 20th; there is
neither rum nor ſpruce beer.</p>
                  <p>Having committed this ſtate of facts to the conſideration of
the council, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral requeſts their ſentiments on the following
propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>1ſt. To wait in the preſent poſition an attack from the
enemy, or the chance of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable events.</p>
                  <p>2d. To attack the enemy.</p>
                  <p>3d. To retreat repairing the bridges as the army moves for the
artillery, in order to force the paſſage of the ford.</p>
                  <p>4th. To retreat by night, leaving the artillery and the baggage;
and ſhould it be found impracticable to force the paſſage with
muſquetry, to attempt the upper ford, or the paſſage round Lake
George.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:0652302600:202"/> In caſe the enemy, by extending to
their left, leave their rear open, to march rapidly for Albany.</p>
                  <p>Upon the firſt propoſition reſolved, that the ſituation
would grow worſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, that the proviſion now in ſtore not more than
ſufficient for the retreat, ſhould impediments intervene, or a circuit of
country become neceſſary; and as the enemy did not attack when the ground
was unfortified, it is not probable they will do it now, as they have a better
game to play.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond unadviſable and deſperate, there being no
poſſibility of reconnoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the enemy's poſition, and his great
ſuperiority of numbers known.</p>
                  <p>The third impracticable.</p>
                  <p>The fifth thought worthy of conſideration by the
Lieutenant-General, Major-General Phillips, and Brigadier-General Hamilton; but
the poſition of the enemy yet gives no opening for it.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, that the fourth propoſition is the only
reſource, and that to effect it, the utmoſt ſecrecy and ſilence is to
be obſerved; and the troops are to be put in motion from the right in the
ſtill part of the night, without any change in the diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>N. B. It depended upon the delivery of ſix days proviſion in
due time, and upon the return of ſcouts, who had been ſent forward to
examine by what route the army could probably move the firſt four miles
undiſcovered, whether the plan ſhould take place on that day, or on the
morrow.</p>
                  <p>The ſcouts on their return reported, that the enemy's
poſition on the right was ſuch, and they had ſo many ſmall parties out,
that it would be impoſſible to move without our march being immediately
diſcovered.</p>

                  <head>Minutes and Proceedings of a Council of War, conſiſting
of all the general Officers and Field Officers, and Captains commanding Corps,
on the Heights of <hi>Saratoga, October</hi> 13.</head>
                  <div type="section">
                     <p>THE Lieutenant-General having explained the ſituation of
affairs, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding council, with the additional intelligence, that
the enemy was intrenched at the fords of Fort Edward, and likewiſe occupied
the ſtrong poſition on the Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains between Fort George and Fort Edward,
expreſſed his readineſs to undertake at their head any enterpriſe of
difficulty or hazard that ſhould appear to them within the compaſs of their
ſtrength of ſpirit. He added, that he had reaſon to believe a
capitulation had been in the contemplation of ſome, perhaps of all, who knew
the real ſituation of things; that upon a circumſtance of ſuch
conſequence to national and perſonal honour, he thought it a duty to his
country, and to himſelf, to extend his council beyond the uſual limits;
that the aſſembly preſent might juſtly be eſteemed a full
repreſentation of the army; and that he ſhould think himſelf
unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable in taking any ſtep in ſo ſerious a matter, without
ſuch a concurrence of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as ſhould make a treaty the act of the
army, as well as that of the general.</p>
                     <p>The firſt queſtion therefore he deſired them to decide
was, Whether an army of 3500 fighting men, and well provided with artillery,
were juſtifiable, upon the principles of national dignity and military
honour, in capitulating in any poſſible ſituation?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:0652302600:203"/> Reſolved, nem. con. in the
affirmative.</p>
                     <p>Queſtion 2. Is the preſent ſituation of that nature?</p>
                     <p>Reſolved, nem. con. That the preſent ſituation
juſtifies a capitulation upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable terms.</p>
                     <p>The Lieutenant-General then drew up the meſſage, marked
No. 2, and laid it before the council. It was unanimouſly approved, and upon
that foundation the treaty opened.</p>
                     <p>October 14. Major Kingſton having delivered the meſſage
marked No. 2. return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the propoſals marked No. 3, and the council of
war being aſſembled again, the Lieutenant-General laid the propoſals
before them, when it was reſolved unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly to reject the 6th article,
and not to admit of it in any extremity whatever.</p>
                     <p>The Lieutenant-General then laid before the council the
anſwers to Major-General Gates's propoſals, as marked in the ſame paper,
together with his own preliminary propoſals, which were unanimouſly
approved of.</p>
                     <p>October 15. The council being aſſembled again,
Major-General Gates's anſwers to Lieutenant-General Burgoyne's propoſals
were laid before them, whereupon it was reſolved, that they were
ſatisfactory, and a ſufficient ground for proceeding to a definitive
treaty.</p>

                     <p>AFTER having fought you twice, Lieutenant-General Burgoyne has
waited ſome days, in his preſent poſition, determined to try a third
conflict againſt any force you could bring to attack him.</p>
                     <p>He is appriſed of the ſuperiority of your numbers, and the
diſpoſition of your troops to impede his ſupplies, and render his retreat
a ſcene of carnage on both ſides. In this ſituation he is impelled by
humanity, and thinks himſelf juſtifiable by eſtabliſhed principles and
precedents of ſtate, and of war, to ſpare the lives of brave men upon
honourable terms. Should Major-General Gates be inclined to treat upon that
idea, General Burgoyne would propoſe a ceſſation of arms during the time
neceſſary to communicate the preliminary terms by which, in any extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
he and his army mean to abide.</p>

                                 <p n="1">I. General Burgoyne's army being exceedingly
reduced by repeated defeats, by deſertion, ſickneſs, &amp;c. their
proviſions exhauſted, their military horſes, tents, and baggage, taken or
deſtroyed, their retreat cut off, and their camp inveſted, they can only be
allowed to ſurrender priſoners of war.</p>
                                 <p>Anſwer. Lieutenant-General Burgoyne's army, however
reduced, will never admit that their retreat is cut off, while they have arms
in their hands.</p>
                                 <p n="2">II. The officers and ſoldiers may keep the
baggage belonging to them. The generals of the United States never permit
individuals to be pillaged.</p>

                                 <p>Anſwer. This article is anſwered by General
Burgoyne's firſt propoſal, which is here annexed.</p>
                                 <p n="4">IV. The officers will be admitted on parole; may
wear their ſide-arms, and will be treated with the liberality cuſtomary in
Europe, ſo long as they, by proper behaviour, continue to deſerve it; but
thoſe who are apprehended having broke their parole, as ſome Britiſh
officers have done, muſt expect to be cloſe confined.</p>
                                 <p>Anſwer. There being no officer in this army under,
or capable of being under the deſcription of breaking parole, this article
needs no anſwer.</p>

the troops under his Excellency General Burgoyne's command may be drawn up in
their encampments, where they will be ordered to ground their arms, and may
thereupon be marched to the river ſide, to be paſſed over in their way
towards Bennington.</p>
                                 <p>Anſwer. This article inadmiſſible in any

               <p>QUESTION.</p>
               <p>General Gates having, in anſwer to General Burgoyne's
meſſage, given a ſolemn affirmation on his honour, that no detachment has
been made from his army during the negociation of the treaty, is the treaty, in
its preſent ſituation, binding on this army, or is the general's honour
engaged for the ſigning it?</p>
               <p>[Here follow the names of the officers as they voted.]</p>
               <p>The lieutenant general's opinion being clear, that he is not bound
by what has paſſed, he would not execute the treaty upon the ſole
conſideration of the point of honour, notwithſtanding the reſpectable
majority againſt him.</p>
               <p>He is likewiſe far from being convinced that this army, by great
exertions and by great enduring in point of proviſions, might not yet be
relieved; but he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to yield on the following conſiderations.</p>
               <p>The treaty was generally thought a moſt advantageous one before
the intelligence arrived. That intelligence is refuted, and ocular
demonſtration of its falſity pledged as far as relates to General Gates's
force; the other parts are only founded on hearſay, and not to be depended
upon.</p>
               <p>Should General Clinton be where reported, yet the diſtance is
ſuch as to render any relief from him improbable during the time our
proviſions could be made to laſt.</p>
               <p>—declares his poſt untenable, and ſays, if this
convention is not ſigned, he apprehends there will be conſiderable
deſertion.</p>
               <p>—ſays he thinks the 47th regiment not to be depended
on.</p>
               <p>—is of the ſame opinion.</p>
               <p>—thinks the 62d regiment is diſheartened by the
ſituation of their poſt, and not equal to their former exertions.</p>
               <p>Several officers think the men in general ſeem to have got the
convention in their heads as deſirable.</p>
               <p>Many of the beſt officers are abſent by ſickneſs and
wounds from all the corps.</p>
               <p>Though the other officers at the head of the Britiſh corps think
they can anſwer for the ſpirit of their men, if attacked on their preſent
ground, it is evident the moſt ſanguine do not think any part of the army
in that elevation and alacrity of ſpirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for undertaking
deſperate enterprizes.</p>
               <p>To break off the treaty now renders a future renewal of it
hopeleſs, as our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt every hour grow worſe.</p>
               <p>A defeat is fatal to the army. A victory does not ſave it, as
they have neither proviſions to advance nor retreat againſt an enemy who by
experience we know are capable of rallying at every advantageous poſt.</p>
               <p>And that the life and property of every provincial and dependant
of this army depends upon the execution of this treaty.</p>

                  <p>THE Boſton news papers, have given extracts from Engliſh and
New York papers, wherein you are mentioned; your arrival, your ſpeeches in
parliament; and a variety of other matters concerning you. I do not always give
credit to news papers, and therefore, the publiſhers at Boſton will
excuſe me, if in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of news I do not give them, in my opinion,
more veracity than I allow the news compilers at London.</p>
                  <p>I will not plague you about our ſituation, as you will know
it, by my aſſuring you it is almoſt exactly as you left us; ſo no more
about it. The troops here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon you their chief, in whatever may relate
to them; their intereſt; their honour. It is not doubted but you will exert
yourſelf, that the officers may gain preferment in common, with other parts
of the army. That you will have the goodneſs to exert yourſelf in behalf of
their ſituation, reſpecting the very great expence of living, and endeavour
to procure the allowance of forage money. And in ſhort, that you will uſe
all your powers of perſuaſion and intereſt for theſe troops, which have
ſerved under you with zeal, and with honour; and endeavour, by ſerving
their ſituation and promoting their honour, to alleviate misfortunes which
nor fortitude nor valour could prevent, and which they ſuffer, however, with
reſignation and patience. I am moſt perfectly convinced of your
affectionate, I will ſay your grateful regard for us all; and I leave
myſelf and the troops to your friendly care; to your humanity; to your
honour.</p>
                  <p>You cannot expect a letter of entertainment; I have not even a
power of making it one of intelligence. It ſhall be however, a letter of
perfect ſincerity, and in the fulleſt ſenſe of it I profeſs to
be,</p>

                  <p>THE heavy misfortune I ſuſtain in being precluded the King's
preſence, touches me in no point more nearly, than in the prevention of doing
juſtice to the various and extenſive merits of the army I had the honour to
command. That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of my ſuppoſed, or real errors, ſhould
involve pretenſions and intereſts of ſo many gallant officers is a
painful reflection; and it can only be alleviated by the trueſt ſenſe of
the truſt to be repoſed in your Lordſhip, for the general protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
the ſervice. The incloſed memorial was accompanied with expreſſions of
reliance, in the name of the whole army, upon my efforts to ſupport it. The
officers in New England little conceive my preſent ſituation: I take the
firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to tranſmit their cauſe to your Lordſhip's happier
auſpices, with this ſolemn declaration, which I have mentioned upon
different public occaſions, and which I can omit no occaſion to repeat,
that there is not a Britiſh officer who ſerved under me during the campaign
of 1777, to whom I can impute blame; that the inſtances are very numerous
wherein particular diſtinction is due; and as a body, they have a claim to my
ſincereſt reſpect for their zeal in the King's ſervice, and to my
utmoſt gratitude for their attention to me perſonally.</p>

            <p>In Plan IV. the third and fourth poſitions of the army in the
engagement of 19th of September may appear upon a curſory view to want
preciſion. The ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities of the ground could not be diſtinctly marked
upon ſo ſmall a ſcale; and the continual ſhift of the poſitions of
ſeparate corps, as they were attacked by corps of the enemy, which
frequently, from the thickneſs of the wood, they did not ſee, made it
equally difficult to mark regularly the poſition of the whole at any one
time.</p>
            <p>The poſition of the armies on the 8th of September in Plate V.
requires alſo ſome explanation. From the ſmallneſs of the ſcale, the
poſition of the enemy could only be ſhewn upon the plain near the river;
but it is to be obſerved, it extended over the ground of General Burgoyne's
former encampment, and in front of the redoubts upon the hill.</p>
