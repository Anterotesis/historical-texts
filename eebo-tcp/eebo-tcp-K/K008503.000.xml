            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>If dunces applauded, he paid them in kind.</l>
               <l>Ye Kenricks, ye Kellys, and Woodfalls ſo grave,</l>
               <l>What a commerce was yours, while you got and you gave?</l>

               <l>While he was beroſſia'd, and you were beprais'd?</l>
               <l>But peace to his ſpirit, wherever it flies,</l>

            <head>EXPLANATORY NOTES and OBSERVATIONS ON DOCTOR GOLDSMITH's POEM, ENTITLED RETALIATION.</head>
            <p>"IF our <hi>landlord</hi> ſupplies us with beef and with fiſh," page 1, line 3] The maſter of the St. James's coffee-houſe, where the Doctor, and the friends he has charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſed in this Poem, held an occaſional club.</p>
            <p>"That Ridge is anchovy," page 6, line 10] Counſellor John Ridge, a gentleman belonging to the Iriſh bar, the <hi>reliſh</hi> of whoſe agreeable and pointed converſation, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by all his acquaintance, to be very properly compared to the above ſauce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0149901500:18"/>"Here lies the good <hi>Dean,"</hi> page 7, line 5] Dr. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Dean of Derry, in Ireland, author of many ingenious pieces, particularly a reply to Macpherſon's Antiquities of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
            <p>"Here lies our <hi>good Edmund,"</hi> page 7, line 11] Mr. Edmund Burke.</p>
            <p>"To perſuade <hi>Tommy Townſhend</hi> to lend him a vote," page 8, line 2] Mr. T. Townſhend Junior, Member for Whitchurch, Hampſhire.</p>
            <p>"Here lies honeſt <hi>William,</hi> page 8, line 11] Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Burke, late Secretary to General Conway, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for Bedwin, Wiltſhire.</p>
            <p>"Here lies honeſt <hi>Richard,"</hi> page 9, line 5] Mr. Richard Burke, Collector of Granada, no leſs remarkable in the walks of wit and humour, than his brother Mr. Edmund Burke is juſtly diſtinguiſhed in all the branches of uſeful and polite literature.</p>
            <p>"Now <hi>breaking a jeſt,</hi> and now <hi>breaking a limb,"</hi> page 9, line 8] the above Gentleman having ſlightly fractured one of his arms and legs, at different times, the Doctor has rallied him on thoſe accidents, as a kind of <hi>retributive</hi> juſtice for breaking his jeſts upon other people.</p>
            <p>"Here <hi>Cumberland</hi> lies," page 10, line 1] Doctor Richard Cumberland, author of the Weſt Indian, Faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lover, the Brothers, and other dramatic pieces.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0149901500:19"/>"Here <hi>Douglas</hi> retires from his toils to relax, </l>
            <l>"The ſcourge of <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> the terror of <hi>Quacks,</hi>"</l>
            <p>—page 11, lines 5 and 6] Doctor Douglas, an ingenious Scotch gentleman, who has no leſs diſtinguiſhed himſelf as a <hi>Citizen of the World,</hi> than a <hi>ſound Critic,</hi> in detecting ſeveral lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary miſtakes (or rather <hi>forgeries)</hi> of his countrymen; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Lauder on Milton, and <hi>Bowyer's Hiſtory of the Popes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Macpherſon</hi> writes bombaſt, and calls it a ſtyle, p. 11, line 13] David Macpherſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who lately, from the mere <hi>force of his ſtyle,</hi> wrote down the firſt poet of all antiquity.</p>
            <p>"Here lies <hi>David Garrick,"</hi> page 12, line 5] David Garrick, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> joint Patentee and acting Manager of the Theatre-Royal, Drury-lane. For the <hi>other parts</hi> of his character, <hi>vide</hi> the Poem.</p>
            <p>"Here <hi>Hickey</hi> reclines," page 14, line 9] A gentleman whoſe hoſpitality and good-humour have acquired him, in this Club, the title of 'honeſt Tom Hickey.' His profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Doctor tells us, is that of an attorney, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he meant the words an echo to the ſenſe or not, he has told us ſo in, perhaps, the only indifferent couplet of the whole Poem. To ſoften this cenſure, however, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the Engliſh Reader is to be told, that the phraſe of "burn ye," in the 5th line of the 15th page, tho' it may ſeem <hi>forced</hi> to rhyme to "attorney," is a familiar method of ſalutation in Ireland amongſt the lower claſſes of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0149901500:20"/>"He ſhifted his Trumpet and only took ſnuff," page the laſt, line the laſt] Sir Joſhua Reynolds, on whom this obſervation was made, is ſo remarkably deaf as to be under the neceſſity of uſing an ear trumpet moſtly in company; he is, at the ſame time, equally remarkable for uſing a great quantity of ſnuff; his manner in both of which, taken in the point of time deſcribed, muſt be allowed, by thoſe who have been witneſſes of ſuch a ſcene, to be as happily given upon <hi>Paper,</hi> as that great Artiſt himſelf, perhaps, could exhibit upon <hi>Canvaſs.</hi>
