            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>I do, upon my ſoul, or I ſhould not have ſaid it to you: the art of ſaying civil things, Kitty, is the true art of making ourſelves and other people happy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1207301100:9"/>—I could ſpeak thus to the woman of my heart for ever—when I had exhauſted my fancy in praiſing her face, her perſon ſhould be my theme—I'd find out new charms in her delicate hand, her fine-turn'd arm, her beauteous neck and enchanting boſom;—for it has long been with me an eſtabliſhed maxim, that it is impoſſible a man can ſay or do too many civil things for a pretty woman.</p>

                     <p>Why, as I was combing his hair yeſterday morning, I obſerv'd him take a miniature picture out of his waiſtcoat pocket, and look at it as if he could eat it with his eyes: judging it to be the likeneſs of ſome favourite Sultana, I ſlyly popp'd my head over his left ſhoulder, and whoſe do you think the picture was?</p>

                     <p>But that's not all! Going out of the room, I left the door on a jar, from a habit I have of peeping and liſtening to every thing that paſſes in a family, and then did I ſee him ſit as good as an hour looking at and kiſſing the picture, for all the world as if Miſs Sophia herſelf had been there.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>But Mr. Mineall coming up ſuddenly, he put the picture in his pocket again in ſuch a hurry as if he was afraid the very light of the ſun ſhould ſteal a kiſs from it.</p>

                     <p>Merely to keep my wit in play, to give a finer edge to my ſatirical vein. Wit, my girl, is like a ſword; if you wou'd make the world admire the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your blade, you muſt throw away the ſcabbard; friend or foe muſt receive the wound, if you would ſhew its point: but a maſter's hand is neceſſary to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the high poliſh of your weapon, making it flaſh at every graceful turn, with the lightning's quickneſs and the diamond's brilliancy.</p>

There's your brother Sandy too; when he heard of your exploit, he muſt needs have an itch for coming to England, and be damn'd to him; I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the figure he cut the firſt time I ſaw him, with his broad accent, his long Scotch face, and ſuch a red head, that you might have lit a candle at his pole; and if I hadn't a regard for him as my ſiſter's ſon, I'd have ſent him trooping back to Scotland again: I had like to have loſt all my Engliſh cuſtomers by the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, for it's well known he was obliged to wear gloves the firſt three months he was in the ſhop.</p>

                     <p>So little value! By every hope I have of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, there is nothing upon earth ſo truly valuable and precious to me: but how muſt you interpret the addreſſes of a man with no certainty of fortune? My uncle is on the point of marriage; to be ſure, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the world conſiders me his heir: but who can foreſee the influence a wife may have on him?</p>

                     <p>True happineſs, George, does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon immenſe fortune; where there is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent competency, what matter on which ſide it is?</p>

                     <p>My generous Sophia! what ſhall I ſay to you? whilſt the charms of your perſon fill my boſom with new delight every moment I behold you; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your mind breaks forth with ſuperior luſtre, as if jealous of thoſe external beauties which firſt won my admiration.</p>

                     <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
                     <p>I have already told you of his plan for breaking off my uncle's marriage with Mrs. Grampus: he is now dreſſing up Dawſon, as a German Baron, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him every neceſſary inſtruction for performing his part with propriety.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Miſs Har.</speaker>
                     <p>As the Baron is ſuppoſed to come from Vienna, I don't think it would be a bad hint to make him profeſs himſelf an admirer of antiquated beauty only; and in the true ſpirit of German gallantry, look
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1207301100:24"/>more for wrinkles than dimples in the countenance of a miſtreſs; I obſerve that there are no characters ſo open to the groſſeſt flattery as your learned ladies, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when the incenſe is offered them by a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Corydon.</p>

                     <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
                     <p>An excellent thought! I'll tell Dawſon of it, and he does not want underſtanding to improve the hint.</p>

                     <p>Your plan is deficient in one particular; your Baron ſhould have brought a balloon with him, and perſuaded the widow he travelled from Germany in it.</p>

You may firſt viſit that moſt beautiful planet, Venus; and by the moſt eaſy tranſit in the world, proceed next to Mercury; I'd make intereſt with Jupiter to obtain his ſatellites, by way of guards, whilſt I was on my travels; and if I ſaw a convenient opportunity, I'd ſteal Saturn's ring for the Britiſh Muſeum.</p>
