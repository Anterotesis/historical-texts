            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The devil!—why, whence comes this change? when Signor Aſcorino, your father, gave it you at Naples, zounds, there was no keeping you within bounds; you had your beſt bib and tucker on in a minute.</p>

               <p>It is indeed; for away we decamped immediately from Naples, and came poſt-haſte here. On our arrival, you perceived you had left the portrait of Iſabella at our inn at Rome; ſo not daring to appear before her without it, away I was diſpatched, as if the devil was in me,

               <p>Yes, brother; and this is the ſubject: Lelio dropt a portrait, which, he ſays, is that of a couſin he has never ſeen, and to whom he was to have been married.</p>

               <p>Lord, madam, how the wind is changed in our corner. When Signor Aſcorino propoſed his ſon to you—oh, dear—nothing was ever ſo charming as the idea of ſuch an alliance—pomp, place, and precedence, at the court of Naples, was ſuch a temptation—away I was ſent for the

moſt famous painter in all Leghorn to draw your portrait; for though you had three by you, one was too ſerious, another too ill-dreſſed, the third too maſculine; in ſhort, every nerve muſt be ſtrained to attract the heart of ſo wealthy and accompliſhed a cavalier.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iſab.</speaker>

               <speaker>Viol.</speaker>
               <p>Now ſee the difference: He ought to have been here eight days ago; and though 'tis poſſible he may have broke his neck upon the road, been aſſaſſinated by robbers, though it is the moſt aſtoniſhing thing in the world we have not ſeen him, when I tell you he is not arrived, you cry—"heaven be praiſed!"</p>

               <p>Nay, what ſignifies mincing the matter?—Your coach breaks down; you are in danger of loſing your life, by falling near the horſes, when a man, all over rags and tatters, flies to your aſſiſtance—he relieves you—inſiſts upon conducting you home—and becauſe he refuſes a purſe of ducats, which you offer him, you are convinced he has a noble mind, an elevated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and a great many more fine things which I have forgot.</p>
