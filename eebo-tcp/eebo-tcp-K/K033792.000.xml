            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

KING DIONYSIUS AND SQUIRE DAMOCLES; A New Song on an Old Story. Proper to be ſung at all Feaſts and Merry-makings.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>THERE was a heathen man, ſir,</l>
               <l>Belonging to a King;</l>
               <l>And ſtill it was his plan, ſir,</l>
               <l>To covet every thing.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And if you don't believe me,</l>
               <l>I'll name him if you pleaſe,</l>
               <l>For let me not deceive ye,</l>
               <l>'Twas one Squire Damocles.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He thought that jolly living</l>
               <l>Muſt every joy afford,</l>
               <l>And knew of no miſgiving,</l>
               <l>While round the feſtive board.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He wanted to be great, ſir,</l>
               <l>And fed on fare delicious,</l>
               <l>And have his feaſts in ſtate, ſir,</l>
               <l>Juſt like King Dionyſius.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The King, to cure his longing,</l>
               <l>Prepar'd a feaſt ſo fine,</l>
               <l>That all the Court were thronging</l>
               <l>To ſee the Courtier dine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And there to tempt his eye, ſir,</l>
               <l>Was fiſh, and fleſh, and fowl,</l>
               <l>And when he was a-dry, ſir,</l>
               <l>He had a brimming bowl.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor did the King forbid him</l>
               <l>From drinking all he could;</l>
               <l>The Monarch never chid him,</l>
               <l>But fill'd him with his food.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O then, to ſee the pleaſure</l>
               <l>Squire Damocles expreſt!</l>
               <l>'Twas joy beyond all meaſure;</l>
               <l>Was ever man ſo bleſt?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With greedy eyes the Squire</l>
               <l>Devour'd each coſtly dainty;</l>
               <l>You'd think he did aſpire</l>
               <l>To eat as much as twenty.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But juſt as he prepar'd, ſir,</l>
               <l>Of bliſs to take his ſwing;</l>
               <l>O, how the man was ſcar'd, ſir!</l>
               <l>By this ſo cruel King!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When he to eat intended,</l>
               <l>Lo! juſt above his head,</l>
               <l>He ſpied a ſword ſuſpended</l>
               <l>All by a ſingle thread.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How did it change the feaſting</l>
               <l>To wormwood and to gall,</l>
               <l>To think, while he was taſting,</l>
               <l>The pointed ſword might fall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then in a moment's time, ſir,</l>
               <l>He loath'd the luſcious feaſt;</l>
               <l>And dreaded, as a crime, ſir,</l>
               <l>The brimming bowl to taſte.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now, if you're for applying</l>
               <l>The ſtory I have told,</l>
               <l>I think there's no denying</l>
               <l>'Tis worth its weight in gold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ye gay, who view this ſtranger,</l>
               <l>And pity his ſad caſe;</l>
               <l>And think there was great danger</l>
               <l>In Damocles's caſe;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Come let this aweful truth</l>
               <l>In all your minds be ſtor'd;</l>
               <l>That DEATH o'er every youth</l>
               <l>Hangs like a pointed ſword.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And tho' you ſee no reaſon,</l>
               <l>To check your mirth at all;</l>
               <l>In ſome ſad drunken ſeaſon</l>
               <l>The ſword on you may fall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So learn, while at your eaſe</l>
               <l>You drink down draughts delicious,</l>
               <l>To think of Damocles,</l>
               <l>And old King Dionyſius.</l>
