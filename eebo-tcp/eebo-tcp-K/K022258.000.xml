            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN an author pretends to write a treatiſe on any particular ſubject, he ought to have leiſure ſufficient to examine and thoroughly conſider every thing that has an intimate connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with it; but, as the Writer of this has no ſuch leiſure, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him to declare that he profeſſes no other knowledge of the ſubject, in queſtion, than what has occurred to him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally in conſulting the law-books on other points; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

               <p>THE doctrine of <q>Nullum Tempus occurrit Regi,</q> if admitted in an unlimited and general ſenſe, is capable of being wreſted to the moſt arbitrary purpoſes, and may ſeem to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the moſt dangerous and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pretenſions and claims on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>As <hi>a general doctrine,</hi> therefore, it is <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> and, conſequently, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the fundamental principles
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0659702200:9"/>
of the <hi>common law;</hi> for which reaſon I never could eſteem the <hi>Nullum Tempus</hi> doctrine as <hi>a maxim</hi> of the common law; and I have ſince found that my opinion of it was in ſome degree right, and that the doctrine is ſo far from being <hi>a general maxim,</hi> that it ought never to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned without its peculiar <hi>exceptions,</hi> leſt it ſhould do injury, by being applied to improper caſes, and be miſtaken for <hi>a maxim,</hi> to the perverſion of juſtice: for the true and proper <hi>maxims</hi> of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law demand the utmoſt deference when they are cited, their authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unqueſtionable; becauſe <q>Contra negantem principia <hi>(vel maxima)</hi> non eſt diſputandum.</q> (Co. Lit. 343. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor &amp; Student, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> c. 8. p. 27.)</p>
               <p>This maxim may indeed ſeem appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to myſelf, for denying that the authority and weight of <hi>a maxim</hi> is due to the doctrine of <hi>Nullum Tempus, &amp;c.</hi> But I hope to be able, in the courſe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0659702200:10"/>
this work, to obviate any ſuch imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to prove <hi>that it really is not a general maxim.</hi> In order to ſet this point in a clear light, it will be neceſſary firſt of all to take a ſhort view of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>rights of the crown,</hi> which, <hi>in law,</hi> are juſtly eſteemed <hi>unalienable,</hi> and which I apprehend to be as follows.</p>
               <p>The king is inveſted, by his office, with a kind of <hi>limited property</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all his <hi>free ſubjects,</hi> by which he is enabled, and, indeed, bound in duty to claim, and <hi>free</hi> them whenever their perſons are unlawfully ſeized, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or otherwiſe detained at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, under pretence of right of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whereby their <hi>perſons</hi> are claimed as <hi>private property,</hi> acquired by purchaſe, cuſtom, or any other mode of acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="*" place="bottom">Query. How far may this hold good ſince the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Habeas Corpus act, which ſuppoſes that a man may be tranſported againſt his will if he has ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a written contract? Sect. 13. This ſection, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, gives no authority for ſuch a forcible tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it only informs us, that the act does NOT <hi>"extend to give benefit" in ſuch caſe;</hi> but the common law, we may preſume, will or ought to <hi>"give benefit"</hi> in this, as in every other caſe, of <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> becauſe <hi>"Lex ſemper dabit remedium:"</hi> and I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn that the right of the Crown is <hi>unalienable</hi> in this kind <hi>of property,</hi> for the maintainance of <hi>freedom.</hi>
                  </note> whatſoever. For no claims of this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0659702200:11"/>
kind, upon a <hi>freeman,</hi> are to be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in law, or can poſſibly be accounted valid, becauſe the maxim aſſures us that <hi>"Liber homo"</hi> is <hi>"res quaſi ſacra," "which may not be ſold:"</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>Item quaſi res ſacra ut <hi>liber homo</hi> qui vendi non poteſt, cùm <hi>libertas</hi> non recipiat aeſtimationem,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bracton, lib. 2, p. 14.</note> ſo that there can be no juſt claim of property <hi>in the perſon of a freeman,</hi> except the <hi>official right</hi> and <hi>claim of property</hi> veſted in the king; and, as this is <hi>limited</hi> by the laws for the benefit and <hi>freedom of the ſubject,</hi> it is, for that very reaſon, <hi>unalienable from the crown.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To all ſuch things we may ſafely apply the doctrine of <q>Nullum tempus occurrit regi.</q>— The ſame is likewiſe applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a few other things, even of an inferior or ſecond claſs; I mean ſuch as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0659702200:13"/>
are nevertheleſs ſo far <hi>alienable,</hi> that they may lawfully, without damage to the king or his ſubjects, be transferred, <hi>for a time,</hi> to other perſons. — <q>Sunt et aliae res quae pertinent ad coronam propter privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium regis, et ita communem non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiciunt utilitatem, quin dari poſſunt et ad alium transferri, quia, ſi transfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur, tranſlatio nulli erit damnoſa, nec ipſi regi ſive principi, &amp;c.</q>—The things, ranked in this claſs of <hi>Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> are, <hi>ſea-wrecks, treaſures found, great fiſh,</hi> as <hi>whales, ſturgeons,</hi> and other <hi>royal fiſh.</hi> And whoſoever pretends to have a right to enjoy the profits ariſing from theſe particular things, muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to produce a ſpecial <hi>warrant</hi> for that purpoſe; becauſe <hi>preſcription,</hi> even of a very long time, is not ſufficient to juſtify the pretenſion: <q>Diuturnitas enim tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris, <hi>in hoc caſu,</hi> injuriam <hi>non minuit, ſed auget, nec in primo caſu,</hi> NEC IN ISTO, CURRIT TEMPUS CONTRA REGEM,

nec incumbit ei probatio quia ad ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum pertineant, cum conſtare debeat ſingulis, quod hujuſmodi de jure gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium pertineant ad coronam.</q>

               <p>But, with reſpect to things of a third claſs, as <hi>crown-manors, lands, tenements,</hi> &amp;c. the caſe is widely different, for the doctrine of <hi>Nullum tempus,</hi> &amp;c. affects them not at all! And I am aſtoniſhed that ſo many gentlemen, learned in the law, whoſe attention has lately been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon this point, ſhould have thought it neceſſary to provide, by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial act of parliament, againſt this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, when <hi>the common law of England,</hi> that ought always to be preferred, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>When common law and ſtatute law concur, the common law ſhall be preferred.</q> 4. Co. 71.</note> has already ſufficiently guarded us againſt the tyrannical conſtruction of the phraſe, which, like a mere bug-bear, is formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable only whilſt miſunderſtood, though it has raiſed an epidemical panic, of which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0659702200:15"/>
the late act is a proof. — <q>Sunt etiam <hi>aliae res</hi> quae pertinent ad coronam, quae <hi>non ſunt ita ſacrae,</hi> quin transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri poſſunt, ſicut ſunt, FUNDI, TERRAE, <hi>et</hi> TENEMENTA, <hi>et</hi> HUJUSMODI per quos corona regis roboratur, et in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus CURRIT TEMPUS CONTRA RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEM, <hi>ſicut contra quamlibet privatam perſonam.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we are aſſured, by the authority of an ancient and unexceptionable writer, that <hi>crown-lands</hi> are exactly upon <hi>the ſame footing</hi> as <hi>private freeholds,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>time</hi> or <hi>preſcription,</hi> which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reverſe of the <hi>Nullum tempus</hi> doctrine, lately adopted by the Treaſury.</p>
               <p>Now, it is a maxim in law, that a quiet and uninterrupted <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> for ſixty years creates a proper title. <q>Poſſeſſio pacifica <hi>POUR ANNS 60</hi> facit jus.</q> (Prin. Leg. et Aeq. p. 81. See alſo Jenk. cent. 26.) And, therefore, as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewn, that <hi>Crown manors, lands,</hi>

And, even when <hi>alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated crown lands</hi> are claimed within any ſhorter term than ſixty years, the king <hi>may not ſeize,</hi> for it is a maxim, <q>That the <hi>king can diſſeize no man,</hi> nor be diſſeized;</q> (Doctor &amp; Student);<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </head>
               <p>THE crown is limited, as well in the mode of <hi>granting,</hi> as in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to <hi>be granted;</hi> inſomuch that when any grant or leaſe is made <hi>contrary to the rules preſcribed by law,</hi> the ſame is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rendered <hi>null and void.</hi> I ſhall not pretend to ſpeak of all the particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions and conditions neceſſary to be obſerved on theſe occaſions, but only ſome few of the moſt eſſential, which, I apprehend, have not been ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded <hi>of late</hi> as they ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0659702200:21"/>The legiſlature hath agreed, and laid it down as a rule, that all the ancient and <hi>military tenures of lands, and</hi> 
                  <q>even <hi>SOCCAGE IN CAPITE,</hi> of the king, and the conſequents upon the ſame, have been much more burthenſome, grievous, and <hi>PREJUDICIAL,</hi> to the kingdom, than they have been <hi>BENEFICIAL</hi> to the king.</q> (See Preamble to 12 Cha. II. cap. 24.) For this juſt reaſon, <hi>founded on experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> the king hath ever ſince been <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the law</hi> from granting any part of his dominions upon ſuch conditions.</p>
               <p>I have, indeed, heard of a foreign iſland being granted to a noble lord upon ſome ſuch <hi>antiquated conditions,</hi> whereby he is ſaid to be eſtabliſhed as <hi>lord para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> with a peculiar unconſtitutional authority; but this, I am willing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, is merely report; and, even if it were true, the grant would be innocent enough, becauſe it is <hi>null and void in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> as the king has had no right ſince

               <p>For this reaſon I have not attempted, by declamation and far-fetched argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to eſtabliſh my opinion; nor do I rely on the intereſt and number of my friends to make it paſs current; neither do I demand favour of my readers, as being a friend to adminiſtration; but
