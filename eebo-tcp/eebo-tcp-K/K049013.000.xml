            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE German original of this Play, which its Author ſtiles 'a Dramatic Romance of the fourteenth century,' has not, I believe, as yet been publiſhed. It never came under my inſpection; and, if it had, I could have made no uſe of it, not underſtanding a ſyllable of the language.</p>
            <p>The model, upon which I worked was an Engliſh tranſlation, that profeſſed nothing more than fidelity to the words of the author, and this I have no doubt it correctly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In this copy I diſcovered the frame-work of what might be made a ſplendid ſpectacle; and the known liberality of thoſe, in whom the property and conduct of the Theatre are
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0747701200:4"/>
veſted, has more than equalled every expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could ground upon their ſupport. What elſe I diſcovered, except as above ſtated, it may not become me to ſay, for I have no right to pronounce upon an author, who compoſes in a language unknown to me; but certain it is, I ſtand reſponſible to the Public for every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in this Drama now before them, with the exception of a very few periods indeed, and thoſe of no great importance. Let Kot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebue therefore anſwer for no more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him—the plot and fabric of <hi>JOANNA.</hi> Whether I have marred it or mended it in the execution, can only be decided when the Public ſhall be in poſſeſſion of the means for comparing them.</p>
            <p>It has ſo rarely been my habit to write upon any plot but of my own fabrication and invention, that what I aſſert in the Prologue is moſt ſtrictly true; viz.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"All, who cou'd judge my labour, wou'd confeſs</l>
               <l>"Originality had made it leſs."</l>
            </q>
            <p>Whether from inaptitude for the taſk, or from whatever other cauſe my embarraſſments have
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0747701200:5"/>
proceeded, ſuch they have been, and ſo many times have I woven and unwoven this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope's web, that if plays were only to be appreciated by the pains they coſt in compoſing, this of mine would have a merit, which I ſuſpect the world will not be in the humour to attach to it. Then indeed I ſhould have one fair exception to ſet againſt the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of precipitation, of which I ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, but of which I cannot be duly convicted, till it is known of how many hours my day conſiſts, and what portion of thoſe I devote to my ſtudies.</p>
            <p>I have heard ſeveral authors inſtance a diſpatch in compoſition, of which I have no conception; but, with reſpect to the drama now ſubmitted, whether I did or did not write it, <hi>ſtans pede in uno,</hi> I can only aſſure the Public, I will never ſtand upon German legs any more, but take my chance with my countrymen for ſo much of their favour as my own independant efforts can obtain for me.</p>
            <p>I have now been ſo often before the Reader, that I muſt claim the privilege of addreſſing him as a friend, whom I am not to flatter,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0747701200:6"/>
and in whoſe company I am not to degrade myſelf by an unmanly ſtile of ſupplication, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed for no other purpoſe than to invoke his candour; the which, if he has not, falſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence will not create, and, if he has, plain ſpeaking will not offend. I therefore ſhall not ſcruple to ſay (ſpeaking under the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of age and long experience) that the diction of Joanna is not inferior to that of any of my moſt favoured plays. I know I have outlived the time, when a ſimple and conſiſtent fable, developed in correct and claſſic diction, preſenting characters to be found in nature, and producing incidents not irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable to probability, can no longer attract: I alſo perceive I have lived to ſee the time, when not content with the eccentricities of our own ſtage, we have gone to that of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans for freſh ſupplies of what we were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocked with—falſe writing and falſe moral. It is too often that the ſucceſs or failure of a play depends upon the <hi>caſt,</hi> not upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; of courſe the play is written more for the actors behind the curtain, than for the audience before it: this makes Tragedy run
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0747701200:7"/>
riot, and Comedy play the antick. We have actors, who poſſeſs ſuch irreſiſtible power over the riſibility of the ſpectator, that our writers for the ſtage find their account in availing themſelves of thoſe powers, and produce a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of compoſition, which, departing from the character of the legitimate drama, may be ſaid to border very nearly upon farce and mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery.</p>
            <p>Where faſhion points, the ſtage will follow. If, endeavouring to write according to nature and good models, the dramatic author finds himſelf deſerted by the Town, who but will be weary of the attempt? If the public taſte is vitiated, the remedy is not with him: the critic may take up the cauſe; a good <hi>dramatic cenſor</hi> may do much, but a ſcurrilous one can effect nothing. Are authors only to be laſhed, and their miſleaders to be paſſed over uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected? The enlarged expences of our royal theatres do not warrant their proprietors in oppoſing themſelves to the public taſte—how then ſhould authors undertake it?</p>
            <p>As I have been uniformly adverſe in my opinion to the introduction of theſe German
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0747701200:8"/>
dramas on the Engliſh ſtage, it may well be ſuppoſed my reaſons for undertaking to adapt this of Joanna were ſtrong ones, and in yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, I have only to regret, that my endeavours have not been more ſerviceable to the intereſts of a theatre, to which I have every obligation, not only for the fair and honourable treatment I experienced from the proprietors, but alſo for the warm and cordial ſupport I received from the performers. <hi>Mr. Incledon</hi> in particular has a claim to my beſt acknowledgments for his very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and zealous perſeverance in his duty, under circumſtances of ſuch an afflicting nature, as might have fully juſtified him for declining it.</p>
            <p>In the copy now printed, I have not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether adhered to the Prompter's book, as it was altered after the firſt night's repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Reader will obſerve I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the incident of Lazarra's falling by the hand of Joanna; this I have done, becauſe I ſee no particular reaſon for departing ſo entirely from the author's firſt conception, though good reaſon obtained, in point of action, for the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0747701200:9"/>
that was made on the ſecond night. On the German ſtage, Albert, in the combat with his rival, ſtumbles over the root of a tree, and falls to the ground; in this inſtant Joanna ruſhes in accoutred in the complete armour of a warlike knight, and with a huge ſword of two-handed ſway diſpatches Lazarra at a ſtroke. Albert, thus critically reſcued, riſes and requeſts the unknown Knight to put up his viſor, when to his aſtoniſhment he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his preſerver in the perſon of his wife. How they may manage theſe matters on the German ſtage I cannot pretend to ſay; perhaps their actors may be better duelliſts, and their actreſſes more adroit in warlike operations than ours; but if we found diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the action, ſimplified as it is, how much more ſhould we have been embarraſſed in point of execution, had we undertaken to perform it in the ſpirit of the original?</p>
            <p>In the concluding ſcene of the third act, Wenſel in the original gets drunk upon the ſtage, and the keys are taken out of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by Philip, whilſt his intoxicated father
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0747701200:10"/>
lies buried in profound ſleep. If what I ſubſtituted in place of this incident is not ſo near to nature as the original, it is certainly leſs offenſive to decorum, and better ſuited to the manners of our Engliſh ſtage. When I am ſpeaking of this ſcene (unqueſtionably the moſt prominent in the play) I cannot paſs it over without acknowledging my obligations to the young and riſing actor, whoſe energetic and impreſſive execution in the character of Philip gave ſuch brilliancy to the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and diſplayed powers, which, when drawn forth by abler authors, and better opportunities, cannot fail to place him in the very higheſt rank of his profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Joanna of Kotzebue is kept out of ſight during the whole time that Lazarra is in poſſeſſion of her caſtle, and of courſe is never before the audience but in the opening and concluſion of the play. It appeared to me expedient to fill up this <hi>hiatus,</hi> and of courſe her ſcenes in the middle acts are ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.</p>
            <p>In like manner, Wolf in the original is
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0747701200:11"/>
merely the ſhadow of a character. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſuch an actor as <hi>Mr. Munden,</hi> is an object which every author will reach at with avidity. I ſincerely thank him for his cordial aſſiſtance; I wiſh my efforts had been more proportionate to his merit. To the performers, who condeſcended to appear in characters, neither adequate to their merits, nor conſonant with their feelings, I have more to offer than acknowledgments; I muſt beg them to accept my apology.</p>
            <p>As there is no muſic in the original, I muſt in juſtice exonerate the author from all reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility on the ſcore of the diſcarded Page. When his ſinging ceaſed, his ſervices were no longer wanted; two ſongs were compoſed for this character, though but one was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; theſe exquiſite melodies will, I hope, be publiſhed by the compoſer; and that I may not appear to keep that out of ſight, which will do him ſo much honour to produce, I retain thoſe ſongs in my copy, and of courſe the whole part of Eugene.</p>
            <p>The overture, choruſſes, and ſongs, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0747701200:12"/>
to the piece, with four ſymphonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the acts, were all compoſed for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by <hi>Mr. Thomas Buſby:</hi> He alſo, in the run of the piece, ſubſtituted a new Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetto inſtead of the Peaſant's chorus in the opening ſcene, and at the ſame time withdrew the finale of Joy, Joy, Joy! and introduced upon the ninth night a ſhorter and moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant chorus to the following words:
<q>
                  <l>"Hail, glorious day! Death ſtrikes our impious foe,</l>
                  <l>"And Victory binds her wreath on Virtue's brow."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is matter of the higheſt ſatisfaction to me to find that the Public have done juſtice to his eminent abilities. I ſincerely hope this his firſt eſſay in the dramatic line will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him to employ his talents upon a larger and more ſplendid ſcale. Where genius ſo ſublime is combined with ſcience ſo profound, what is there within the province of his ſtudies, which the world may not expect from <hi>Mr. Buſby?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the oppoſition, which was given to this play upon the firſt evening only of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, has paſſed over me without injury, I ſhould have paſſed over it without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0747701200:13"/>
but that I am given to underſtand an opinion was in circulation, that I had vanity enough to conceive I had prepared a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, and compoſed a drama to rival, nay to eclipſe, one that was triumphantly eſtabliſhed on the ſiſter ſtage. As an author, I have never appealed from the deciſions of the theatre: conſcious that nothing can be more perfectly at the mercy of the Public than an author's reputation, when he has committed it to the ſtage, I have never offered a ſingle word in arreſt of judgment, however rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, nor perſiſted to obtrude myſelf, when I had once diſcovered I was no longer welcome. That we had no reaſon to yield the play up upon the partial clamour of the firſt night, the event of the ſecond clearly evinced; not a murmur was heard, and the applauſe was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. If I had been the arrogant man, which it is preſumed I was thought to be by ſome of my opponents, their reſentment would have fallen ſo much more heavily upon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral proprietors of the theatre, than upon me individually, that there would have been infinitely more cruelty than juſtice in their
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0747701200:14"/>
revenge. But the taſk of adapting this Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Drama to our ſtage was no work of my ſeeking, and though I expended more pains upon it than I ever did upon any play in my life, the hopes I formed of its ſucceſs were chiefly grounded on the brilliancy of the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, and the excellence of the muſic: As for Pizarro, I envy not his ſucceſs; I do not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to rival it, I cannot wiſh to leſſen it; and if any man doubts my ſincerity, let him put himſelf in the predicament of an author, for years held off from receiving the fair and moderate earnings of his productive ſervices; and looking to that very fund for indemnifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then let him aſk his conſcience what he would ſay to ſuch an idle imputation, and his anſwer ſhall be mine.</p>

                  <p>Ah, thou murderer! Hence to thoſe ſhades thyſelf! Behold, 'tis done—He faints, he falls, he dies—Save me, ſupport me! Oh Philip, tell me, does my Albert live?</p>

                  <p>Take hence the body! Sound a retreat, and call in the purſuers! Now to the caſtle—'Tis Joanna's triumph, and we will grace it with our beſt diſplay. To all my friends and brave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, thanks! Actions muſt ſpeak my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0747701200:103"/>
time muſt ſhew what my full heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, for language cannot. Philip, behold our venerable Hermit; and in his hand, like Truth led on by Time, thy deſtin'd bride approaches.</p>

                  <p>Albert, if every conqueror had a cauſe worthy as your's, we ſhou'd rejoice in conqueſts; but in this world, for reaſons only known to Heaven, bad men will triumph for a time, and be the lords and arbiters of fortune. You are both good and proſperous, and your candour in owning me the rightful Lord of Thurn, cancels your father's wrongs; but what you riſqu'd your life to gain for life you ſhall poſſeſs. Give Philip Belmont, and I'll give him her, that wou'd convert a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to a palace—Take her, brave youth, ſhe's your's!</p>
