            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving recommended this Play to the Town, and delivered the Copy of it to the Bookſeller, I think my ſelf oblig'd to give ſome Account of it.</p>
            <p>It had been ſome Years in the Hands of the Author, and falling under my Peruſal, I thought ſo well of it that I perſuaded him to make a few Additions and Alterations to it, and let it appear upon the Stage. I own I was very highly pleaſed with it, and lik'd it the better, for the want of thoſe ſtudyed Similes and Repartees, which we, who have writ before him, have thrown into our Plays, to indulge and gain upon a falſe Taſte that has prevailed for many Years in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Theatre. I believe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have fallen into this Way a little more than he has, had he, before the writing of it, been often preſent at Theatrical Repreſentations, and obſerv'd the Effect that ſuch Ornaments generally have upon the Town. I was confirmed in my Thoughts of the Play, by the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of better Judges to whom it was Communicated, who obſerved that the Scenes were written very much after <hi>Moliere</hi>'s Manner, and that an eaſie and natural Vein of Humour ran through the whole.</p>
            <p>I do not queſtion but the Reader will diſcover this, and ſee many Beauties that eſcape the Audience; the Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb facs="tcp:0405900100:5"/>
being too delicate for every Taſte in a Popular Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. My Brother-Sharers were of Opinion, at the firſt reading of it, that it was like a Picture in which the Strokes were not ſtrong enough to appear with Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at a Diſtance. As it is not in the common way of Writing, the Approbation was at firſt Doubtful, but has riſen every time it has been Acted, and has given an Opportunity in ſeveral of its Parts for as juſt and good Action as I ever ſaw on the Stage.</p>
            <p>The Reader will conſider that I ſpeak here as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentee, for which Reaſon I forbear being more particular in the Character of this Play, leaſt I ſhould appear like one, who cries up the Wares of his own Shop to draw in Cuſtomers.</p>

               <p>Women who have been happy in a firſt Marriage, are the moſt apt to venture upon a ſecond. But for my part, I had a Husband ſo every way ſuited to my Inclinations, that I muſt entirely forget him, before I can like another Man. I have now been a Widow but fourteen Months, and have had twice as many Lovers, all of 'em profeſt Admirers of my Perſon, but paſſionately in love with my Jointure. I think it is a Revenge I owe my Sex to make an Example of this worthleſs Tribe of Fellows, who grow impudent, dreſs themſelves fine, and fancy we are oblig'd to provide for 'em. But of all my Captives, Mr. <hi>Tinſel</hi> is the moſt extraordinary in his kind. I hope the Diverſion I give my ſelf with him is unblameable. I'm ſure 'tis neceſſary to turn my Thoughts off from the Memory of that dear Man, who has been the greateſt Happineſs and Affliction of my Life. My Heart would be a Prey to Melancholy, if I did not find theſe innocent Methods of relieving it. But here comes <hi>Abigal.</hi> I muſt teaze the Baggage, for I find ſhe has taken it into her Head that I am entirely at her Diſpoſal.</p>

               <p>We have been long Friends, we are your Ho—nour's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Servants, Sack is an Innocent Cordial, and gives her Spirit to chide the Servants, when they are tardy in their Bus'neſs; he, he, he! pardon me for being Jocular.</p>

               <p>For the Uſe of the Servants! What, are the Rogues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of ſleeping in the Dark? What an unfortunate Woman am I! This is ſuch a particular Diſtreſs, it puts me to my Wits End. <hi>Vellum,</hi> what wou'd you adviſe me to do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vel.</speaker>
               <p>Madam, your Ho—nour has two Points to conſider. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis,</hi> To retrench theſe Extravagant Expences, which ſo many Strangers bring upon you.—<hi>Secondly,</hi> To clear the Houſe of this Inviſible Drummer</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
               <p>This learned Diviſion leaves me juſt as wiſe as I was. But how muſt we bring theſe two Points to bear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vel.</speaker>
               <p>I beſeech your Ho—nour to give me the hearing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
               <p>I do. But prithee take pity on me, and be not tedious.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vel.</speaker>
               <p>I will be conciſe. There is a certain Perſon arrived this Morning, an aged Man of a venerable Aſpect, and of a long hoary Beard, that reacheth down to his Girdle. The common People call him a Wizard, a White-Witch, a Conjurer, a Cunning-Man, a Necromancer, a—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>No matter for his Titles. But what of all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vel.</speaker>
               <p>Give me the hearing, good my Lady! he pretends to great Skill in the Occult Sciences, and is come hither upon the rumor of this <hi>Drum.</hi> If one may believe him, he knows the Secret of laying Ghoſts, or of quieting Houſes that are haunted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
               <p>Pho, theſe are Idle Stories to amuſe the Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, this can do us no good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vel.</speaker>
               <p>It can do us no harm, my Lady.</p>

               <speaker>Vel.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay, I do; there is no danger however in the Experiment. Let him try his Skill; if it ſhou'd ſucceed, we are rid of the Drum; if it ſhou'd not, we may tell the World that it has, and by that means at leaſt get out of this Expenſive way of living; ſo that it muſt turn to your Advantage one way or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
               <p>I think you argue very rightly. But where is the Man? I would fain ſee him. He muſt be a Curioſity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vel.</speaker>
               <p>I have already diſcours'd him, and he is to be with me, in my Office, half an Hour hence. He asks nothing for his Pains, till he has done his Work;—no Cure, no Mony.</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>A Lord! No, nothing like it,—He's a Conjurer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coach.</speaker>
               <p>A Conjurer! what, is he come a wooing to my Lady?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, you Fool, he's come a purpoſe to lay the Spirit.</p>
            </sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>He's lock'd up with the Steward in his Office, they are laying their Heads together very cloſe. I fancy they are caſting a Figure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gard.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee <hi>John,</hi> what ſort of a Creature is a Conjurer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>Why he's made much as other Men are, if it was not for his long grey Beard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coach.</speaker>
               <p>Look ye <hi>Peter,</hi> it ſtands with reaſon, that a Conjurer ſhou'd have a long grey Beard—for did ye ever know a Witch that was not an Old Woman?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0405900100:29"/>
               <speaker>Gard.</speaker>
               <p>Why! I remember a Conjurer once at a Fayr, that to my thinking was a very Smock-fac'd Man, and yet he ſpew'd out fifty Yards of green Ferret. I fancy, <hi>John,</hi> if thou'dſt get him into the Pantry and give him a Cup of Ale, he'd ſhew us a few Tricks. Do'ſt think we cou'd not perſuade him to ſwallow one of thy Caſe-Knives for his Diverſion? He'll certainly bring it up again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi>! thou art ſuch a Wiſe-acre! Thou do'ſt not know the Difference between a Conjurer and a Jugler. This Man muſt be a very great Maſter of his Trade. His Beard is at leaſt half a Yard long, he's dreſs'd in a ſtrange dark Cloak, as black as a Cole, your Conjurer always goes in Mourning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gard.</speaker>
               <p>Is he a Gentleman, had he a Sword by his Side?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, he's too grave a Man for that, a Conjurer is as grave as a Judge,—but he had a long white Wand in his Hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coach.</speaker>
               <p>You may be ſure there's a good deal of Vertue in that Wand—I fancy 'tis made out of Witch Elm.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gard.</speaker>
               <p>I warrant you if the Ghoſt appears, he'll whisk ye that Wand before his Eyes, and ſtrike you the Drum-ſtick out of his Hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>No; the Wand, look ye, is to make a Circle, and if he once gets the Ghoſt in a Circle, then he has him—let him get out again if he can. A Circle, you muſt know, is a Conjurer's Trap.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coach.</speaker>
               <p>But what will he do with him, when he has him there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>Why then he'll overpower him with his Learning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gard.</speaker>
               <p>If he can once compaſs him, and get him in Lobs-Pound, he'll make nothing of him, but ſpeak a few hard Words to him, and perhaps bind him over to his good Behaviour, for a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coach.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, ay, hell ſend him packing to his Grave again with a Flea in his Ear, I warrant him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, I wou'd adviſe Madam to ſpare no Coſt. If the Conjurer be but well paid, he'll take pains upon the Ghoſt, and lay him, look ye, in the Red-Sea—and then he's laid for ever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coach.</speaker>
               <p>Ay marry, that wou'd ſpoil his Drum for him.</p>

               <speaker>Gard.</speaker>
               <p>Why <hi>John,</hi> there muſt be a power of Spirits in that ſame Red-Sea—I warrant ye they are as plenty as Fiſh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coach.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I wiſh after all that he may not be too hard for the Conjurer; I'm afraid he'll find a tough bit of work on't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>But.</speaker>
               <p>As for that, <hi>Peter,</hi> you may be ſure that the Steward has made his Bargain with the Cunning-Man beforehand, that he ſhall ſtand to all Coſts, and Damages—But hark! yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Mrs. <hi>Abigal,</hi> we ſhall have her with us immediately, if we do not get off.</p>

               <p>Ay Lads! if we could get Mrs. <hi>Abigal</hi> well laid too—we ſhould lead merry Lives.</p>

               <p>I Wonder I don't hear of <hi>Vellum</hi> yet. But I know his Wiſdom will do nothing raſhly. The Fellow has been ſo us'd to Form in Buſineſs, that it has infected his whole Converſation.

                  <l>TO Night, the Poet's Advocate I ſtand,</l>
                  <l>And he deſerves the Favour at my hand,</l>
                  <l>Who in my Equipage their Cauſe debating</l>
                  <l>Has plac'd two Lovers, and a third in waiting;</l>
                  <l>If both the firſt ſhou'd from their Duty ſwerve,</l>
                  <l>There's one behind the Wainſcote in reſerve.</l>
                  <l>In his next Play, if I wou'd take this Trouble,</l>
                  <l>He promis'd me to make the Number double:</l>
                  <l>In troth 'twas ſpoke like an obliging Creature,</l>
                  <l>For tho' 'tis Simple, yet it ſhews Good-nature.</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>My Help thus ask'd, I cou'd not chuſe but grant it,</l>
                  <l>And really I thought the Play wou'd want it,</l>
                  <l>Void as it is of all the uſual Arts</l>
                  <l>To warm your Fancies, and to ſteal your Hearts:</l>
                  <l>No Court-Intrigue, nor City-Cuckoldom,</l>
                  <l>No Song, no Dance, no Muſick—but a Drum—</l>
                  <l>No ſmutty Thought in doubtful Phraſe expreſt;</l>
                  <l>And, Gentlemen, if ſo, pray where's the Jeſt?</l>
                  <l>When we wou'd raiſe your Mirth, you hardly know,</l>
                  <l>Whether in ſtrictneſs you ſhou'd Laugh or no,</l>
                  <l>But turn upon the Ladies in the Pit,</l>
                  <l>And if they redden, you are ſure 'tis Wit.</l>

                  <l>He draws a Widow, who of blameleſs Carriage</l>
