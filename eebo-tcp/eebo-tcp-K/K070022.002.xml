            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Engliſh, it could ſcarce be expected, that the death of one ſovereign,
and the acceſſion of another, who was ſtrongly ſuſpected to have
embraced oppoſite principles to thoſe which prevailed, could be the
ſubject of univerſal ſatisfaction: 
<note place="margin">Queen's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity.</note> Yet ſo much were
men diſpleaſed with the preſent conduct of affairs, and ſuch
apprehenſions were entertained of futurity, that the people, overlooking
their theological diſputes, expreſſed a very general and unſeigned joy
that the ſcepter had paſſed into the hands of Elizabeth. That princeſs
had diſcovered great prudence in her conduct during the reign of her
ſiſter; and as men were ſenſible of the imminent danger to which ſhe
was every <pb n="404" facs="tcp:0429000102:5"/> moment expoſed, the compaſſion towards her
ſituation, and concern for her ſafety, had rendered her, to an uncommon
degree, the favourite of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A Parliament had been aſſembled a few
days before Mary's death; and when Heathe, archbiſhop of York, then
chancellor, notified to them that event, ſcarce an interval of regret
appeared; and the two houſes immediately reſounded with the joyful
acclamations of 
<q rend="inline">"God ſave Queen Elizabeth: Long and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily

               <p>ELIZABETH was at Hatfield when ſhe heard of her ſiſter's
death; and after a few days ſhe proceeded thence to London, thro' crowds of
people, who ſtrove with each other in giving her the ſtrongeſt
teſtimony of their affections. On her entrance into the Tower, ſhe could
not forbear reflecting on the great difference between her preſent fortune
and that which a few years before had attended her, when ſhe was conducted to
that place as a priſoner, and lay there expoſed to all the bigotted
malignity of her enemies. She fell on her knees, and expreſſed her thanks
to heaven, for the deliverance which the Almighty had granted her from her
bloody perſecutors; a deliverance, ſhe ſaid, no leſs miraculous than
that which Daniel had received from the den of lions. This act of pious
gratitude ſeems to have been the laſt circumſtance in which ſhe
remembered any paſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and hardſhips. With a prudence and
magnanimity truly laudable, ſhe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all offences in oblivion, and
received with aſfability even thoſe who had acted with the greateſt
virulence againſt her. Sir Harry Bennifield himſelf, to whoſe cuſtody
ſhe had been committed, and who had treated her with uncommon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
never felt, during the whole courſe of her reign, any effects of her
reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 374.</note>. Yet was not
the gracious reception which ſhe gave, proſtitute and
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhing. When the biſhops came in a body to make their
obeiſance to her, ſhe expreſſed to all of them ſentiments of regard;
except to Bonner, from whom ſhe turned aſide, as from a man polluted with
blood, who was a juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of horror to every heart ſuſceptible of
humanity<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. Heylin, p. 102.</note>.</p>
               <p>AFTER employing a few days in ordering her domeſtic affairs,
Elizabeth noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to foreign courts, her ſiſter's death, and her own
acceſſion to the crown. She ſent lord Cobham to the Low Countries, where
Philip then reſided; and ſhe took care to expreſs to that monarch, her
gratitude for the protection which he had aſſorded her, and her deſire of
preſevering in that friendſhip which was ſo <pb n="405" facs="tcp:0429000102:6"/> happily
commenced between them. Philip, who had long foreſeen this event, and who
ſtill hoped, by means of Elizabeth, to obtain that dominion over Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
which he had failed of in eſpouſing Mary, immediately diſpatched orders
to the duke of Feria, his ambaſſador at London, to make propoſals of
marriage to the Queen, and he offered to procure from Rome a diſpenſation
for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But Elizabeth ſoon came to the reſolution of declining
this propoſal. She ſaw that the nation had entertained an extreme
averſion to the Spaniſh alliance during her ſiſter's reign; and that
one great cauſe of the popularity which ſhe herſelf enjoyed, was the
proſpect of being freed, by her means, from the danger of foreign
ſubjection. She was ſenſible, that her affinity with Philip, was exactly
ſimilar to that between her father and Catherine of Arragon; and that her
mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying that monarch was, in effect, declaring herſelf illegitimate, and
incapable of ſucceeding to the throne. And tho' the power of the Spaniſh
monarchy might ſtill be ſufficient, in oppoſition to all pretenders, to
ſupport her title, her maſculine ſpirit diſdained ſuch precarious
dominion, which, as it would depend ſolely on the power of another, muſt be
exerciſed according to his inclination<note n="*" place="bottom">

prevented her from entertaining any thoughts of a marriage with Philip, ſhe
gave him a very obliging, tho' evaſive, anſwer; and he ſtill retained
ſuch hopes of ſucceſs, that he ſent a meſſenger to Rome, with
orders to ſollicit the diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>THE Queen too, on her ſiſter's death, had wrote to Sir
Edward Carne, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ambaſſador at Rome, to ſignify her
acceſſion to the pope; but the precipitate nature of Paul broke thro' all
the cautious meaſures concerted by that young princeſs. He told Carne, that
England was a ſief of the holy ſee; and it was a great temerity in her to
have aſſumed, without his participation, the title and authority of Queen:
That Elizabeth, being illegitimate, could not poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ſentence pronounced by Clement the ſeventh, and Paul the third, with regard
to Henry's marriage: That were he to proceed with rigour, he would puniſh
this criminal invaſion of his rights, by rejecting all her applications; but
being willing to treat her with paternal indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he would ſtill keep the
door of grace open to her: And that if ſhe would renounce all pretenſions

reign, inclined to the reformation; and tho' her ſiſter had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
them to profeſs the ancient faith, the cruelties exerciſed by her
miniſters, had ſtill more alienated their affections from it: That happily
the intereſts of the ſovereign concurred here with the inclinations of the
people; nor was her title to the crown compatible with the authority of the
Roman pontiff: That a ſentence, ſo ſolemnly pronounced by two popes
againſt her mother's marriage, could not poſſibly be recalled, without
inflicting a mortal wound on the credit of the ſee of Rome; and even if ſhe
was allowed to retain the crown, it would only be on an uncertain and dependant
footing: That this motive counterballanced all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers whatever; and theſe
dangers themſelves, if narrowly viewed, would be found very little
formidable: That the curſes and execrations of the Romiſh church, when not
ſeconded by military force, were, in the preſent age, more an object of
ridicule than of terror, and had now as little influence in this world as in
the next: That tho' the bigotry or ambition of Henry or Philip might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
them to execute a ſentence of excommunication againſt her, their
intereſts were ſo incompatible, that they never could concur in any plan of
operations; and the enmity of the one would always enſure to her the
friendſhip of the other: That if they encouraged the diſcontents of her
catholic ſubjects, their dominions alſo abounded with proteſtants, and it
would be eaſy to retaliate that injury upon them: That even ſuch of the
Engliſh as ſeemed at preſent zealouſly attached to the catholic faith,
would moſt of them embrace the religion of their new ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; and the
nation had of late been ſo accuſtomed to theſe revolutions, that men had
loſt all idea of truth and falſehood in ſuch ſubjects: That the
authority of Henry the eighth, ſo highly raiſed by many concurring
circumſtances, firſt enured the people to this ſubmiſſive deference;
and it was more eaſy for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding princes to continue the nation in
a train to which it had been ſo long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed: And that it would be
eaſy for her, by beſtowing on proteſtants all <pb n="407" facs="tcp:0429000102:8"/> the
commiſſions in civil offices and the militia, the church and the
univerſities, both to enſure her own authority, and to render her religion

               <p>THE education of Elizabeth, as well as her intereſt, led her
to favour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and ſhe remained not long in ſuſpenſe with
regard to the party, which ſhe ſhould embrace: But tho' determined in her
own mind, ſhe reſolved to proceed by gradual and ſecure ſteps, and not
to imitate the example of Mary, in encouraging the bigots of her party to make
immediately a violent invaſion on the eſtabliſhed religion<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p. 378. Camden, p. 371</note>. She
thought it requiſite, however, to diſcover ſuch ſymptoms of her
intentions, as might give encouragement to the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, ſo much
depreſſed by the late violent perſecution. She immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called all
the exiles, and gave liberty to the priſoners who were confined on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of religion. We are told of a pleaſantry of one Rainsford on this
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who ſaid to the Queen, that he had a petition to preſent her
in behalf of other priſoners called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John: She
readily replied, that it behoved her firſt to conſult the priſoners
themſelves, and to learn of them whether they deſired that liberty, which
he demanded for them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 103.</note>.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH alſo proceeded to exert, in favour of the reformers,
ſome acts of power, which were conſiſtent with the extent of the royal
prerogative during that age. Finding, that the proteſtant teachers, irritated
by perſecution, broke out in a furious attack of the antient
ſuperſtition, and that the Romaniſts replied with no leſs zeal and
acrimony, ſhe publiſhed a proclamation, by which ſhe prohibited all
preaching without a ſpecial licence<note n="§" place="bottom">Heylin, p.
104. Strype, vol. I. p. 41.</note>; and tho' ſhe diſpenſed with this
prohibition in favour of ſome preachers of her own ſect, ſhe took care,
that they ſhould be the moſt calm and moderate of the party. She alſo
ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the laws ſo far as to order a great part of the ſervice; the
litany, the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the goſpels; to be read in
Engliſh. And having firſt publiſhed injunctions, that all the churches
ſhould conform themſelves to the practice of her own chappel, ſhe forbade
the hoſte to be any more elevated in her preſence; an innovation, which,
however frivolous it may appear, implied the moſt material
conſequences<note n="‖" place="bottom">Camden, p.

               <p>THESE declarations of her intention, concurring with the

amidſt the joyful acclamations of her ſubjects, a boy, who perſonated
truth, was let down from one of the triumphal arches, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her with
a copy of the Bible. She received the book with the moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
deportment, placed it next her boſom, and declared, that, amidſt all the
coſtly teſtimonies which the city had that day given of their attachment,
this preſent was by far the moſt precious and moſt acceptable<note n="†" place="bottom">

Such were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent artifices, by which Elizabeth inſinuated herſelf
into the affections of her ſubjects. Open in her addreſs, gracious and
affable in all public appearances, ſhe rejoiced in the concourſe of her
ſubjects, entered into all their pleaſures and amuſements, and without
departing from her dignity, which ſhe knew well how to preſerve, ſhe
acquired a popularity beyond what any of her predeceſſors or
ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ever could attain. Her own ſex exulted to ſee a woman
hold the reins of empire with ſuch prudence and fortitude: And while a young
princeſs of twenty-five years (for that was her age at her acceſſion) who
poſſeſſed all the graces and inſinuation, tho' not all the beauty of
her ſex, courted the affections of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals by her civilities, of the

authority by its former variable, ſervile and iniquitous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions.
Satisfied therefore in the general opinion entertained with regard to this
fact, which appeared the more undoubted, the leſs anxiety ſhe diſcovered
in fortifying it by votes and enquiries; ſhe took poſſeſſion of the

               <p>THE firſt bill which was brought into the Parliament with a
view of trying their diſpoſition with regard to religion, was that for
ſuppreſſing the monaſteries lately erected, and for reſtoring the
tenths and firſt-fruits to the Queen. This point being gained without much
difficulty, a bill was next introduced, annexing the ſupremacy to the crown;
and tho' the Queen was there denominated <hi>governeſs,</hi> not
<hi>head,</hi> of the church, it conveyed the ſame extenſive power, which
had formerly been exerciſed by her father and brother. All the biſhops who
were preſent in the upper houſe ſtrenuouſly oppoſed this law; and as
they poſſeſſed more learning than the temporal peers, they triumphed in
the argument; but the majority of voices in that houſe, as well as among the
commons, were againſt them. By this act the crown, without the concurrence,
either of the Parliament or even of the convocation, was veſted with the
whole ſpiritual power; might repreſs all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies<note n="†" place="bottom">In determining hereſy, the crown was only limited (if that could

was anew granted in the act of uniformity. 1 Eliz. cap. 2.</note>. In order to
exerciſe this unlimited authority, the Queen, by a clauſe of the act, was
empowered to name commiſſioners, either laymen or clergymen, as ſhe
ſhould think proper; and on this clauſe was afterwards founded the court of
eccleſiaſtical commiſſion; which aſſumed very large
diſcretionary, not to ſay arbitrary powers, totally incompatible with any
exact limitations in the conſtitution. Their proceedings indeed were only
conſiſtent with abſolute monarchy; but were entirely ſuitable to the
genius of the act on which they were eſtabliſhed; an act that at once gave
the crown all the power, which had formerly been claimed by the popes, but
which even theſe uſurping prelates had never been able fully to exerciſe,
without ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the clergy.</p>

acknowledging the Queen's ſupremacy, was incapacitated from holding any
office; whoever denied the ſupremacy, or attempted to deprive the Queen of
that prerogative, forfeited, for the firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, all their goods and
chattels, for the ſecond were ſubjected to the penalty of a premunire; but
the third offence was declared treaſon. Theſe puniſhments, however
ſevere, were leſs rigorous than ſuch as were formerly, during the reigns
of her father and brother, inflicted in like caſes.</p>
               <p>A LAW was paſſed, confirming all the ſtatutes enacted in
King Edward's time with regard to religion<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Eliz. cap. 2.</note>: The nomination
of biſhops was given to the crown without any election of the chapters: The
Queen was empowered, on the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of any ſee, to ſeize all the
temporalities, and to beſtow on the biſhops-elect an equivalent in the
impropriations belonging to the crown. This pretended equivalent was commonly
very much inferior in value; and thus the Queen, amidſt all her concern for
religion, followed the example of the preceding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, in committing
depredations on the eccleſiaſtical revenues.</p>
               <p>THE biſhops and all incumbents were prohibited from alienating
their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and from letting leaſes longer than twenty-one years or
three lives. This law ſeemed to be intended for ſecuring the property of
the church; but as an exception was left in favour of the crown, great abuſes
ſtill prevailed. It was uſual for a courtier, during this reign, to make a
tranſaction with a biſhop or incumbent; and to procure a ſham alienation
to the Queen, who afterwards transferred the lands to the perſon agreed
on<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype, vol. I. p. 79.</note>. This method of
pillaging the church was not remedied till the beginning of James the firſt.
The preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the clergy expoſed them to all injuries; and
the laity never ſtopped till they had reduced the church to ſuch poverty,
that her plunder was no longer a compenſation for the odium incurred by
it.</p>
               <p>A SOLEMN and public diſputation was held during this
ſeſſion, in preſence of lord keeper Bacon, between the divines of the
proteſtant and thoſe of the catholic party. The champions appointed to
defend the religion of the ſovereign, were, as in former inſtances,
entirely triumphant, and the popiſh diſputants, being pronounced refractory
and obſtinate, were even puniſhed by impriſonment<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 95.</note>. Emboldened by this victory, the
proteſtants ventured on the laſt and moſt important ſtep, and brought
into Parliament a bill<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Eliz. cap. 2.</note>
for aboliſhing the maſs, and re-eſtabliſhing the liturgy of King
Edward. Penalties were enacted, as well againſt thoſe who departed from
this mode of worſhip, as thoſe who abſented themſelves from the church
and the ſacraments. And thus in one ſeſſion, without any violence, 
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0429000102:12"/> tumult, or clamour, was the whole ſyſtem of religion
altered, on the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of a reign, and by the will of a young
woman, whoſe title to the crown was by many eſteemed liable to great
objections: An event, which, tho' it may appear ſurprizing to men in the
preſent age, was every where expected on the firſt news of her
acceſſion.</p>
               <p>THE commons alſo made a ſacrifice to the Queen more
difficult to obtain than that of any articles of religion: They voted a
ſubſidy of four ſhillings in the pound on land, and two ſhillings and
eight pence on goods, together with two fifteenths<note n="*" place="bottom">The
Parliament alſo granted the Queen the duties of tonnage and poundage; but
this conceſſion was at that time regarded only as a matter of form, and
ſhe had levied theſe duties before they were voted by the Parliament: But
there was another exertion of power, which ſhe practiſed, and which people,
in this age, from their ignorance of the antient conſtitution, may be apt to
think a little extraordinary. Her ſiſter, after the commencement of the war
with France, had, from her own authority, impoſed four marks on each ton of
wine imported, and had encreaſed the poundage a third on ail commodities.
Queen Elizabeth continued theſe impoſitions as long as ſhe thought
convenient. The Parliament, who had ſo good an opportunity of reſtraining
theſe arbitrary taxes, when they voted the tonnage and poundage, thought
proper not to make any mention of them. They knew, that the ſovereign, during
that age, pretended to have the ſole regulation of foreign trade, and that
their intermed lling with that prerogative would have drawn on them the
ſevereſt reproof, if not chaſtiſement. See Forbes vol. I. p. 132, 133.
We know certainly from the ſtatutes and journals, that no ſuch
unpoſitions were granted by Parliament.</note>. The houſe in no inſtance
departed from the moſt reſpectful deference and complaiſance towards the
Queen. Even the importunate addreſs, which they made her on the concluſion
of the ſeſſion, to fix her choice of a huſband, could not, they
ſuppoſed, be very diſagreeable to one of her ſex and age. The addreſs
was couched in the moſt reſpectful expreſſions; yet met with a
refuſal from the Queen. She told the ſpeaker, that as the application from
the houſe was conceived in general terms, only recommending marriage, without
pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to direct her choice of a huſband, ſhe could not take offence
at the addreſs, or regard it as other than a new inſtance of their
affectionate attachment towards her: That any farther interpoſal on their
part would have ill become either them to make, as ſubjects, or her to hear
as an independant princeſs: That even while ſhe was a private perſon, and
expoſed to much danger, ſhe had always declined that engagement, which
ſhe regarded as an incumbrance; much more, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent would ſhe
perſevere in that ſentiment, when the charge of a great kingdom was
committed to her, and her life ought to be entirely dedicated to promoting the
intereſts of religion and the happineſs of her ſubjects: That as England
was her huſband, wedded to her by this pledge (and here ſhe ſhewed them
her ſinger with the ſame gold ring upon it, with which ſhe had ſolemnly
betrothed herſelf <pb n="412" facs="tcp:0429000102:13"/> to the kingdom at her inauguration)
ſo all Engliſhmen were her children; and while ſhe was employed in the
rearing or governing ſuch a family, ſhe could not eſteem herſelf
barren, or her life uſeleſs and unfruitful: That if ſhe ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
thoughts of changing her condition, the care of her ſubjects welfare would
ſtill be uppermoſt in her thoughts; but ſhould ſhe live and die a
virgin, ſhe doubted not but the divine providence, ſeconded by their
counſels and her own meaſures, would be able to prevent all diſpute with
regard to the ſucceſſion, and ſecure them a ſovereign, who, perhaps
better than her own iſſue, would imitate her example in loving and
cheriſhing her people: And that for her part, ſhe deſired that no higher
character, nor fairer remembrance of her ſhould be tranſmitted to
poſterity, than to have this inſcription engraved on her tomb-ſtone, when
ſhe ſhould pay the laſt debt to nature;

government.</note>, the laws, enacted with regard to religion, were put in
execution, and met with no diſturbance or oppoſition from any quarter. The
liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar tongue, and the oath of ſupremacy
was tendered to the clergy. The number of biſhops had been reduced to
fourteen by a very ſickly ſeaſon, which preceded; and all of theſe,
except the biſhop of Landaffe, having refuſed compliance, were degraded
from their ſees: But of the inferior clergy throughout all England, where
there are near 10,000 pariſhes, only eighty pariſh rectors, fifty
prebendaries, fifteen heads of colleges, twelve archdeacons, and as many deans,

honour in their perſeverance; but on the whole, the proteſtants, in the
former change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by Mary, appear to have been much more rigid and
conſcientious. Tho' the catholic religion, adapting itſelf to the
ſenſes, and requiring obſervances, which enter into the common train of
life, does at preſent lay much faſter hold of the mind than the reformed,
which, being chiefly ſpiritual, reſembles more a ſyſtem of
metaphyſics; yet was the proportion of zeal, as well as of knowlege, during
the firſt ages after the reformation, much greater on the ſide of the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. The catholics continued, ignorantly and ſupinely, in their
antient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or rather their antient practices: But the reformers, obliged
to diſpute on every <pb n="413" facs="tcp:0429000102:14"/> occaſion, and enflamed to a
degree of enthuſiaſm by novelty and perſecution, had ſtrongly attached
themſelves to their tenets; and were ready to ſacrifice their fortunes and
even their lives, in defence of their ſpeculative and abſtract prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
The forms and ceremonies, ſtill preſerved in the Engliſh liturgy, as they
bore ſome reſemblance to the antient ſervice, tended farther to reconcile
the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics to the eſtabliſhed religion; and as the Queen permitted no
other mode of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and at the ſame time ſtruck out every thing that
could be offenſive to them in the new liturgy<note n="*" place="bottom">Heylin,

ſcruple of attending the eſtabliſhed church. Had Elizabeth gratified her
own inclinations, the exterior appearance, which is the chief circumſtance
with the people, would have been ſtill more ſimilar between the new and the
antient form of worſhip. As ſhe loved ſtate and magnificence in every
thing, ſhe was ſomewhat addicted to the pomp of the catholic religion; and
it was merely in compliance with the prejudices of her party, that ſhe gave

Parliament were employed in ſettling the public religion, the negotiations
for a peace were ſtill conducted, firſt at Cercamp, then at
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau-Cambreſis, between the miniſters of France, Spain, and England;
and Elizabeth, tho' equally prudent, was not ſo ſucceſsful in this
tranſaction. Philip employed his utmoſt efforts to procure the
reſtitution of Calais, both as bound in honour to indemnify England, which,
merely on his account, had been drawn into the war, and as engaged in
intereſt to remove France from his frontiers in the Low Countries. So long as
he entertained hopes of eſpouſing the Queen, he delayed concluding a peace
with Henry; and even after the change of religion in England deprived him of
all ſuch views, his miniſters hinted a propoſal, which may be regarded as
reaſonable and honourable. After all his own terms with France were
ſettled, he ſeemed willing to continue the war, till ſhe ſhould obtain
ſatisfaction; provided ſhe would ſtipulate to adhere to the Spaniſh
alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and continue hoſtilities againſt Henry, during the courſe of

conſulting with her miniſters, very wiſely rejected this propoſal. She
was ſenſible of the low ſtate of her finances; the great debts contracted
by her father, brother, and ſiſter; the diſorders introduced into every
part of <pb n="414" facs="tcp:0429000102:15"/> the adminiſtration; the diviſions by which
her people were agitated; and ſhe was convinced that nothing but tranquillity
during ſome years could bring the kingdom again into a flouriſhing
condition, or enable her to act with dignity and vigour, in her tranſactions
with foreign nations. Well acquainted with the value which Henry put upon
Calais, and the impoſſibility of recovering it by treaty during the
preſent emergency, ſhe was willing rather to ſuffer that loſs, than
ſubmit to ſuch a dependance on Spain, as ſhe muſt expect to fall into,
if ſhe continued pertinaciouſly in her preſent demand. She ordered,
therefore, her am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, the lord Effingham, the biſhop of Ely, and
Dr. Wotton, to conclude the negociation, and to ſettle a peace with Henry, or
any reaſonable terms. Henry offered to ſtipulate a marriage between the
eldeſt daughter of the dauphin, and the eldeſt ſon of Elizabeth; and to
engage for the reſtitution of Calais as the dowry of that princeſs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Forbes, vol. I. p. 54.</note>; but as the Queen was
ſenſible that this treaty would appear to the world a palpable evaſion,
ſhe inſiſted upon more equitable, at leaſt, more plauſible
conditions. It was at laſt agreed, that Henry ſhould reſtore Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais at
the expiration of eight years; that in caſe of failure, he ſhould pay five
hundred thouſand crowns, and the Queen's title to Calais ſtill remain; that
he ſhould find the ſecurity of ſeven or eight foreign merchants, not
natives of France, for the payment of this ſum; that he ſhould deliver five
hoſtages till that ſecurity was provided; that if Elizabeth broke the peace
with France or Scotland during that interval, ſhe ſhould forfeit all title
to Calais; but if Henry made war on Elizabeth, he ſhould be obliged
immediately to reſtore that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.
p. 68. Rymer, tom XV. p. 505.</note>. Every perſon of penetration eaſily
ſaw, that theſe ſtipulations were but a colourable pretence for
abandoning Calais; but they excuſed the Queen on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the
neceſſity of her affairs, and they even extolled her prudence, in
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, without farther ſtruggle, to that neceſſity. A peace with
Scotland was a neceſſary conſequence of that with France.</p>
               <p>PHILIP and Henry concluded hoſtilities with a mutual
reſtitution of all places taken during the courſe of the war; and Philip
eſpouſed the princeſs Elizabeth, eldeſt daughter of France, formerly
betrothed to his ſon Don Carlos. The duke of Savoy married Margaret, Henry's
ſiſter, and obtained a reſtitution of all his dominions of Savoy and
Piedmont, except a few towns, retained by France. And thus general tranquillity

Queen of Scots.</note> BUT tho' a peace was ſigned and concluded between
France and England, there ſoon appeared a ground of quarrel, of the moſt
ſerious nature, and which was afterwards attended with the moſt important
conſequences. The two mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages <pb n="415" facs="tcp:0429000102:16"/> of Henry the eighth,
that with Catherine of Arragon, and that with Anne Boſeyn, were totally
incompatible with each other, and it ſeemed impoſſible that both of them
could be regarded as valid and legal: But ſtill the birth of Elizabeth lay
under ſome diſadvantages, to which that of her ſiſter, Mary, was not
expoſed. Henry's firſt marriage had obtained the ſanction of all the
powers, both civil and eccleſiaſtical, which were then acknowleged in
England; and it was natural, for proteſtants as well as Romaniſts, to
allow, on account of the ſincere intention of the parties, that their
iſſue ought to be regarded as legitimate. But his divorce, and ſecond
marriage, had been concluded in direct oppoſition to the ſee of Rome; and
tho' they had been ratified by the authority both of the Engliſh Parliament
and convocation, thoſe who were ſtrongly attached to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic church,
and who reaſoned with great ſtrictneſs, were led to regard them as
entirely invalid, and to deny altogether the Queen's right of ſucceſſion.
The next heir of blood was the Queen of Scots, now married to the dauphin; and
the great power of that princeſs, joined to her plauſible title, rendered
her a very formidable rival to Elizabeth. The King of France had ſecretly
been ſolliciting at Rome a bull of excommunication againſt the Queen; and
ſhe had here been beholden to the good offices of Philip, who, from
intereſt more than either friendſhip or principle, had negociated in her
favour, and had ſucceſsfully oppoſed the pretenſions of Henry. But the
court of France was not diſcouraged with this repulſe: The duke of Guiſe,
and his brothers, thinking, that it would much augment their credit, if their
niece ſhould bring an acceſſion of England, as ſhe had already done of
Scotland, to the crown of France, engaged the King not to neglect the claim;
and, by their perſuaſion, he ordered his ſon and daughter-in-law to
aſſume openly the arms as well as title of England, and to quarter theſe
arms on all their equipages, furniture, and liveries. When the Engliſh
ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador complained of this injury, he could obtain nothing but an
evaſive anſwer; that as the Queen of Scots was deſcended from the blood
royal of England, ſhe was entitled, by the example of many princes, to
aſſume the arms of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But beſides that this practice had
never prevailed without permiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt obtained, and without
making a viſible difference between the arms, Elizabeth plainly ſaw, that
this pretenſion had not been advanced during the reign of her ſiſter
Mary; and that, therefore, the King of France intended, on the firſt
opportunity, to diſpute her legitimacy, and her title to the crown. Alarmed
with the danger, ſhe thenceforth conceived a ſtrong jealouſy againſt
the Queen of Scots; and was determined, as far as poſſible, to incapacitate
Henry from the execution of his project. The ſudden death of that monarch,
who was killed in a tournament at Paris, while he was celebrating the
eſpouſals of his <pb n="416" facs="tcp:0429000102:17"/> ſiſter with the duke of Savoy,
altered not her views. Being informed, that his ſucceſſor, Francis the
ſecond, ſtill continued to aſſume, without reſerve, the title of King
of England, ſhe began to conſider him and his Queen as her moſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
enemies; and the preſent ſituation of affairs in Scotland afforded her a
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity, both of revenging the injury and of providing for her
own ſafety.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Scotch affairs.</note> THE murder of the
cardinal-primate at St. Andrews, had deprived the Scotch catholics of a head
whoſe ſeverity, courage, and capacity had rendered him extremely formidable
to the innovators in religion; and the execution of the laws againſt hereſy
began thenceforth to be much more remiſs and gentle. The Queen-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
governed the kingdom by prudent and moderate councils; and as ſhe was not
diſpoſed to ſacrifice the civil intereſts of the ſtate to the bigotry
or intereſts of prieſts, ſhe eſteemed it more expedient to temporize,
and to connive at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of a doctrine which ſhe had not power
entirely to repreſs. When informed of the death of Edward, and the
acceſſion of Mary to the crown of England, ſhe entertained hopes, that
the Scottiſh reformers, deprived of the countenance which they received from
that powerful kingdom, would loſe their ardour with their proſpect of
ſucceſs, and would gradually return to the faith of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. But
the progreſs and revolutions of religion are little governed by the uſual
maxims of civil policy; and the event much diſappointed the regent's
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. Many of the Engliſh preachers, terrified with the ſeverity
of Mary's government, took ſhelter in Scotland, where they found more
protection, and a milder adminiſtration; and while they propagated their
theological tenets, they filled that whole kingdom with a juſt horror
againſt the cruelties of the bigoted catholics, and ſhowed their
diſciples the fate which they muſt expect, if ever their adverſaries
ſhould attain an uncontrouled authority over them.</p>
               <p>A HIERARCHY, moderate in its acquiſitions of power and riches,
may ſafely grant a toleration to ſectaries; and the more it abates the
fervor of innovators by lenity and liberty, the more ſecurely will it
poſſeſs thoſe advantages which the legal eſtabliſhments beſtow
upon it. But where ſuperſtition has raiſed a church to ſuch an
exorbitant height as that of Rome, perſecution is leſs the reſult of
bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry in the prieſts, than of a neceſſary policy; and the rigour of
law is the only method of repelling the attacks of men, who, beſides
religious zeal, have ſo many other motives, derived both from public and
private intereſt, to engage them on the ſide of innovation. But tho' ſuch
overgrown hierarchies may long ſupport themſelves by theſe violent
expedients, the time comes, when ſeverities tend only to enrage the new
ſectaries, and make them break thro' all bounds of reaſon and moderation.
This criſis was now viſibly approaching in Scotland; and 
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0429000102:18"/> whoever conſiders merely the tranſactions reſulting
from it, will be inclined to throw the blame equally on both parties; whoever
enlarges his view, and reflects on the ſituations, will obſerve the
neceſſary progreſs of human affairs, and the operation of thoſe
principles which are inherent in human nature.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reformation in Scotland.</note> SOME heads of
the reformers in Scotland, ſuch as the earl of Argyle, his ſon lord Lorne,
the earls of Morton, and Glencarne, Erſkine of Dun, and others, finding the
danger to which they were expoſed, and deſirous to propagate their
principles, entered privately into a bond or aſſociation; and called
themſelves the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the Lord, in contradiſtinction to
the eſtabliſhed church, which they denominated the Congregation of Satan.
The tenor of the bond was as follows: 
<q rend="inline">"We, perceiving how Satan, in his members, the
antichriſts of our time, do cruelly rage, ſeeking to overthrow and to
deſtroy the goſpel of Chriſt and his congregation, ought, according to
our bounden duty, to ſtrive, in our maſter's cauſe, even unto the death,
being certain of the victory in him. We do therefore promiſe, before the

diligence continually apply our whole power, ſubſtance, and our very lives,
to maintain, ſet forward, and eſtabliſh the moſt bleſſed word of
God and his congregation; and ſhall labour, by all poſſible means, to
have faithful miniſters, truly and purely to miniſter Chriſt's goſpel
and ſacraments to his people: We ſhall maintain them, nouriſh them, and

               <p>HAD the ſubſcribers of this zealous league been contented
only to demand a toleration of the new opinions; however incompatible their
pretenſions might have been with the policy of the church of Rome, they would
have had the praiſe of oppoſing tyrannical laws, enacted to ſupport an
eſtabliſhment prejudicial to civil ſociety: But it is plain, that they
carried their views much farther; and their practice immediately diſcovered
the ſpirit by which they were actuated. Supported by the authority which,
they thought, belonged to them as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation <pb n="418" facs="tcp:0429000102:19"/> of

bonds of aſſociation are always the forerunners of rebellion; and this
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent invaſion of the eſtabliſhed religion was the actual commencement
of it.</p>
               <p>BEFORE this league was publicly known or avowed, the clergy,
alarmed with the progreſs of the reformation, attempted to recover their
loſt authority, by a violent exerciſe of power, which tended ſtill
farther to augment the zeal and number of their enemies. Hamilton, the primate,
ſeized Walter Mill, a prieſt of an irreproachable life, who had embraced
the new doctrines; and having tried him at St. Andrews, condemned him to the
flames for hereſy. Such general averſion was diſcovered to this
barbarity, that it was ſome time before the biſhops could prevail on any
one to act the part of a civil judge, and pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon him;
and even after the time of his execution was fixed, all the ſhops of St.
Andrews being ſhut, no one would ſell a rope to tie him to the ſtake, and
the primate himſelf was obliged to furniſh this implement. The man bore the
torture with that courage which, tho' uſual on theſe occaſions, always
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears aſtoniſhing and ſupernatural to the multitude: The people, to
expreſs their abhorrence againſt the cruelty of the prieſts, raiſed a
monument of ſtones on the place of his execution; and as faſt as the
ſtones were removed by order of the clergy, they were again ſupplied from
the voluntary zeal of the populace<note n="‖" place="bottom">Knox, p.
122.</note>. It is vain for men to oppoſe the ſevereſt puniſhments to
the united principles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and public applauſe; and this was the
laſt barbarity of the kind which the catholics had the power to exerciſe in
Scotland.</p>
               <p>SOME time after, the people diſcovered their ſentiments in
ſuch a manner as was ſufficient to prognoſticate to the prieſts, the
fate which was awaiting them. It was uſual on the feſtival of St. Giles,
the tutelar ſaint of Edinburgh, to carry in proceſſion the image of that
ſaint; but the proteſtants, in order to prevent the ceremony, found means,
on the eve of the feſtival, to purloin the ſtatue from the church, and they
pleaſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> themſelves with
imagining the aſtoniſhment and diſappointment of his votaries. The
clergy, however, ſramed haſtily a new image, which, in deriſion, was
called by the people young St. Giles; and they carried it thro' the ſtreets,
attended with all the eccleſiaſtics in the town and neighbourhood. The
multitude abſtained from violence ſo long as the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regent 
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0429000102:20"/> continued a ſpectator, but the moment ſhe retired,
they invaded the idol, threw it in the dirt, and broke it in pieces. The flight
and terror of the prieſts and fryars, who, it was remarked, deſerted, in
his greateſt diſtreſs, the object of their worſhip, was the ſource of
univerſal mockery and laughter.</p>
               <p>ENCOURAGED by all theſe appearances, the congregation
proceeded with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in openly ſolliciting ſubſcriptions to their
league; and the death of Mary of England, with the acceſſion of Elizabeth,
which happened about this time, contributed much to increaſe their hopes of
final ſucceſs in their undertaking. They ventured to preſent a petition
to the regent, craving a reformation of the church, and of the <hi>wicked,
ſcandalous,</hi> and <hi>deteſtable</hi> lives of the prelates and
ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtics<note n="*" place="bottom">Knox, p. 121.</note>. They applied
to the Parliament, by a petition, in which, after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, that they could
not communicate with the damnable idolatry, and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable abuſes of the
papiſtical church, they deſired, that the laws againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics ſhould
be executed by the civil magiſtrate alone, and that the ſcripture ſhould
be the ſole rule for judging of hereſy<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.
p. 123.</note>. They even petitioned the convocation, and inſiſted that
prayers ſhould be ſaid in the vulgar tongue, and that biſhops ſhould be
choſen with the conſent of the gentry of the dioceſe, and prieſts with
the conſent of the pariſhioners<note n="‡" place="bottom">Keith, p.

and as ſhe aimed at procuring a matrimonial crown for her ſon-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, the

extremities with either of them.</p>
               <p>BUT after this conceſſion was obtained, ſhe received

attacked the prieſt with fury, broke the images in pieces, tore the pictures,
overthrew the altars, ſcattered about the ſacred vaſes; and leſt no
implement of idolatrous worſhip, as they called it, entire or unbroken. They
thence proceeded with additional numbers, and augmented rage, to the

Queen-regent, provoked at theſe violences, aſſembled an army, and
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to chaſtiſe the rebels. She had about two thouſand French under
her command, with a few Scotch troops; and being aſſiſted with ſuch of
the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as were well affected to her, ſhe pitched her camp within ten
miles of Perth. Even the earl of Argyle, and the lord James Stuart, prior of
St. Andrew's, the Queen's natural brother, tho' deeply engaged with the
reformers, attended the regent in this enterprize, either becauſe they blamed
the fury of the populace, or hoped by their influence and authority to mediate
ſome agreement between the parties. The congregation, on the other hand, made
preparations for defence; and being joined by the earl of Glencarne from the
Weſt, and being countenanced by many of the nobility and gentry, they
appeared formidable from their numbers, as well as the zeal by which they were
animated. They ſent an addreſs to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <pb n="421" facs="tcp:0429000102:22"/> where
they plainly inſinuated, that if they were purſued to extremity, by the
cruel beaſts, the churchmen, they would have recourſe to foreign powers for
aſſiſtance; and they ſubſcribed themſelves her faithful ſubjects
in all things not repugnant to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſſuming, at the ſame time, the
name of the faithful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Chriſt Jeſus<note n="*" place="bottom">Knox, p. 129.</note>. They applied to the nobility attending her,
and maintained, that their paſt violences were juſtified by the word of
God, which commands the godly to deſtroy idolatry, and all the monuments of
it; that tho' all civil authority was ſacred, yet was there a great
difference between the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and the perſons who exerciſed it<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 131.</note>; and that it ought to be
conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not thoſe abominations, called by the peſtilent
papiſts, religion, and which they defend by fire and ſword, be the true
religion of Chriſt Jeſus. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated with ſuch of the Queen's
army as had formerly embraced their party, and told them, 
<q rend="inline">"That as they were already reputed traitors by
God, they ſhould likewiſe be excommunicated from their ſociety, and from
the participation of the ſacraments of the church, which God by his mighty
power had erected among them; whoſe miniſters have the ſame authority

lofty in their pretenſions than the ancient hierarchy; and it was therefore
no wonder they were enraged againſt theſe latter as their rivals in

long infeſted that kingdom; and which, tho' now mollified by the lenity of

               <p>THE Queen regent, finding ſuch obſtinate zeal in the
malecontents, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to embrace the councils of Argyle and the prior of
St. Andrew's, and to form an accommodation with them. She was received into
Perth, which ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her, on promiſing an indemnity of paſt
offences, and engaging not to leave any French garriſon in the place. This
capitulation, it is pretended, was not exactly obſerved. Some of the
inhabitants were moleſted on account of the late violences; and ſome
companies of Scotch ſoldiers, ſuppoſed to be in French pay, were
quartered in the town; which ſtep, tho' taken under a very plauſible
pretext, was regarded by the congregation as an infraction of the treaty<note n="*" place="bottom">Knox, p. 139.</note>. It is aſſerted, that the regent, to
juſtify theſe meaſures, declared, that princes ought not to have their
promiſes too ſtrictly urged upon them; nor was any faith to be kept with
heretics: And that for her part, could ſhe find as good a colour of reaſon,
ſhe would willingly bereave all theſe men of their lives and fortunes<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. Spotſwood, p. 123.</note>. But it is no way
likely, that ſuch expreſſions dropt from this prudent and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
princeſs. On the contrary, it appears, that theſe violences were very
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to her; that ſhe was in this particular over-ruled by the
authority of the French counſellors placed about her; and that ſhe often
thought, if the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe affairs had been entruſted wholly to
herſelf, ſhe could eaſily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force, have accommodated all
differences<note n="‡" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 146. Melvil, p. 29.
Knox, p. 225, 228. Leſly, lib. x. That there was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally no violation of the
capitulation of Perth, appears from the manifeſto of the congregation in
Knox, p. 184. where it is not ſo much as pretended. The companies of Scotch
ſoldiers were, probably, in Scotch pay, ſince the congregation complains,
that the country was oppreſſed with taxes to maintain armies. Knox, p. 164,
165. And even if they had been in French pay, it were no breach of the
capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſince they were national troops, not French Knox does not
ſay, p. 139, that any of the inhabitants of Perth were tried or puniſhed
for their paſt offences; but only that they were oppreſſed with the
quartering of ſoldiers: And the congregation in their manifeſto, ſay only
that many of them had fled for fear. This plain detection of the calumny with
regard to the breach of the capitulation of Perth, may make us ſuſpect a
like calumny with regard to the promiſe pretended not to give ſentence
againſt the miniſters. The affair lay altogether between the regent and the
laird of Dun; and that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, tho' a man of ſenſe and character, might
be willing to take ſome general profeſſions for promiſe. If the Queen,
over awed by the power of the congregation, gave ſuch a promiſe, in order
to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to proceed to a ſentence; how could ſhe expect to have
power to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> obtained. And to what
purpoſe could it ſerve?</note>.</p>
               <p>THE congregation enflamed with their own zeal, and enraged with
theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, remained not long in tranquillity. Even before they
left Perth, <pb n="423" facs="tcp:0429000102:24"/> and while as yet they had no colour to
complain of any violation of treaty, they had ſigned a new covenant, in
which, beſides their engagements to mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, they vowed in the name
of God to employ their whole power in deſtroying every thing that
diſhonoured his holy name; and this covenant was ſubſcribed, among
others, by Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew's<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith,
p. 89. Knox, p. 138.</note>. Theſe two leaders now deſired no better
pretext for deſerting the regent and openly joining their aſſociates,
than the complaints, however doubtful, or rather falſe, of her breach of
promiſe. The congregation alſo, encouraged by this acceſſion of force,
gave up themſelves entirely to the furious zeal of Knox, and renewed at
Crail, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruther, and other places in Fife, like depredations on the
churches and mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries with thoſe formerly committed at Perth and
Couper. The regent, who marched againſt them with her army, finding their
power ſo much increaſed, was glad to conclude a truce for a few days, and
to paſs over with her forces to the Lothians. The inſurgents beſieged and
took Perth; proceeded thence to Stirling, where they exerciſed their uſual
ſury; and finding nothing able to reſiſt them, they bent their march to
Edinburgh, the inhabitants of which, as they had already anticipated the zeal
of the congregation againſt the churches and monaſteries, gladly opened
their gates to them. The regent, with the few forces which remained with her,
took ſhelter in Dunbar, where ſhe ſhut herſelf up, in expectation of a
reinforcement from France.</p>
               <p>MEANWHILE, ſhe employed her partizans in repreſenting to the
people the dangerous conſequences of this open rebellion; and ſhe
endeavoured to convince them, that the lord James, under pretence of religion,
had formed the ſcheme of wreſting the ſcepter from the hands of the
ſovereign. By theſe conſiderations many were engaged to deſert the army
of the congregation; but much more by the want of pay or any means of
ſubſiſtance; and the regent, obſerving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents to be much
weakened, ventured to march to Edinburgh, with a deſign to ſuppreſs them.
On the interpoſal of the duke of Chatelraut, who ſtill adhered to her,
ſhe agreed to a capitulation, in which ſhe granted them a toleration of
their religion, and they engaged to commit no farther depredations on the
churches. Soon after they evacuated the city of Edinburgh; and before they left
it, they proclaimed the articles of agreement; but they took care to publiſh
only the articles favourable to themſelves, and they were guilty of an
impoſture, in adding one to the number, viz. that idolatry ſhall not again
be erected in any place where it was at that time ſuppreſſed<note n="‡" place="bottom">Knox, p. 153, 154, 155. This author pretends that
this article was agreed to verbally, but that the Queen's ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:0429000102:25"/> AN agreement concluded, while men's minds
were in this diſpoſition, could not be durable; and both ſides
endeavoured to ſtrengthen themſelves as much as poſſible, againſt the
enſuing rupture, which appeared inevitable. The regent having got a
reinforcement of 1000 men from France, began to fortify Leith; and the
congregation ſeduced the duke of Chatelraut to their party, who had long
appeared inclined to them, and who was at laſt determined by the arrival of
his ſon, the earl of Arran, from France, where he had eſcaped many dangers,
from the jealouſy, as well as bigotry, of Henry and the duke of Guiſe. More
French troops ſoon after diſembarked under the command of La Broſſe,
who was followed by the biſhop of Amiens and three doctors of the Sorbonne.
Theſe laſt were ſupplied with ſtore of ſyllogiſms, authorities,
citations, and ſcholaſtic arguments, which they intended to oppoſe to the
Scotch preachers, and which, they juſtly preſumed, would acquire force, and
operate conviction on mens minds, by the influence of the French arms and
artillery<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 134. Thuan. lib XXIV. c.

               <p>THE conſtable Montmorency had always oppoſed the marriage of
the Queen of Scots with the dauphin, and had foretold, that, by forming ſuch
cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions with Scotland, the antient league would be diſſolved;
and the natives of that kingdom, jealous of a foreign yoke, would ſoon
become, inſtead of allies, attached by intereſt and inclination, the moſt
inveterate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the French dominion. But tho' the event ſeemed now to
have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the prudence of that aged miniſter, it is not improbable,
conſidering the violence of the councils, by which France was governed, that
the inſurrection was eſteemed a favourable event; as affording a pretence
for ſending over armies, for entirely ſubduing the country, for attainting
the rebels<note n="†" place="bottom">Forbes, vol. I. p. 139. Thuan. lib.
XXIV. c. 13.</note>, and for preparing means thence to invade England, and
ſupport Mary's title to the crown of that kingdom. The leaders of the
congregation, well acquainted with theſe views, were not inſenſible of
their danger, and ſaw that their only ſafety conſiſted in the vigour
and ſucceſs of their meaſures. They were encouraged by the intelligence
received of the ſudden death of Henry the ſecond; and having paſſed an
act from their own authority, depriving the Queen dowager of the regency, and
ordering all the French troops to evacuate the kingdom, they collected forces
to put their edict in execution againſt them. They became maſters again of
Edinburgh; but found themſelves unable to keep long poſſeſſion of
that city. <pb n="425" facs="tcp:0429000102:26"/> Their tumultuary armies, aſſembled in
haſte, and ſupported by no pay, ſoon ſeparated themſelves upon the

the regent, was levying a new army againſt them in Germany, they thought
themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable for applying, in this extremity, to the
aſſiſtance of England; and as the ſympathy of religion, as well as
regard to national liberty, had now counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanced the antient animoſity

                     </gap>th January.</note> THE appearance of Elizabeth's fleet in the Firth
very much diſconcerted the French army, who were at that time ravaging the
county of Fiſe; <pb n="427" facs="tcp:0429000102:30"/> and obliged them to make a circuit by
Stirling, in order to reach Leith, where they ſhut themſelves up, and
prepared for defence. The Engliſh army, rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by 5000 Scotch<note n="*" place="bottom">Haynes, vol I. p. 256, 259.</note>, ſat down before Leith; and
after two ſkirmiſhes, in the former of which, the Engliſh had the
advantage, in the latter the French, they began to batter the town; and tho'
repulſed with conſiderable loſs in a raſh and ill conducted
aſſault, they reduced the garriſon to great difficulties. Their
diſtreſs was augmented by two events; the diſperſion by a ſtorm of
d'Elbeuf's fleet, which carried a conſiderable army on board<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 223.</note>, and the death of the Queen
regent, who expired about this time in the caſtle of Edinburgh; a woman
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with all the capacity which ſhone forth in her family, but
poſſeſſed of much more virtue and moderation than appeared in the
conduct of the other branches of it. The French, who found it impoſſible to
ſubſiſt for want of proviſions, and who ſaw that the Engliſh were
continually reinforced by new numbers, were obliged to capitulate. 
<note place="margin">5th July.</note> And the biſhop of Valence
and count Randan, plenipotentiaries from France, ſigned a treaty at Edinburgh
with Cecil and Dr. Wotton, whom Elizabeth had ſent to Edinburgh for that
purpoſe. 
<note place="margin">Settlement of Scotland.</note> It was there
ſtipulated, that the French ſhould, all of them, inſtantly evacuate
Scotland; that the King and Queen of France and Scotland ſhould thenceforth
abſtain from bearing the arms of England, or aſſuming the title of that
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that farther ſatisfaction for the injury already done in that
particular ſhould be granted Elizabeth; and that commiſſioners ſhould
meet to ſettle this point, or if they could not agree, that the King of Spain
ſhould be arbiter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the crowns. Beſides theſe ſtipulations,
which regarded England, ſome conceſſions were granted to the Scotch,
which the plenipotentiaries, in the name of the King and Queen of France and
Scotland, promiſed in the treaty with Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth to obſerve; that an
amneſty ſhould be publiſhed for all paſt offences; that none but
natives ſhould be put into any office in Scotland; that the ſtates ſhould
name twenty-four perſons, of whom the Queen of Scots ſhould chuſe
ſeven, and the ſtates five, and in the hands of theſe twelve ſhould the
whole adminiſtration be placed during that Queen's abſence; and that Mary
ſhould neither make peace nor war without conſent of the ſtates<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rymer, vol XV. p. 593. Keith, p. 137. Spotſwood, p.
147. Knox, p. 229.</note>. In order to haſten the execution of this important
treaty Elizabeth ſent ſhips, by which the whole French forces were
tranſported into their own country.</p>
               <p>THUS all Europe ſaw, in the firſt tranſaction of this
reign, the genius and capacity of the Queen and her miniſters. She
diſcerned at a diſtance the danger, <pb n="428" facs="tcp:0429000102:31"/> which threatened
her; and took inſtantly vigorous meaſures to prevent it. Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the
poſſible advantages of her ſituation, ſhe proceeded with celerity to a
deciſion; and was not diverted by any offers, negotiations, or
remonſtrances of the French court. She ſtopped not till ſhe had brought
the matter to a final iſſue; and had converted that very power, to which
her enemies truſted for her deſtruction, into her firmeſt ſupport and
ſecurity. By exacting no improper conditions from the Scotch inſurgents,
even during their greateſt diſtreſs, ſhe eſtabliſhed an entire
confidence with them; and having cemented the union by all the tyes of
gratitude, intereſt and religion, ſhe now poſſeſſed an influence
over them above what remained even with their native ſovereign. The regard
which ſhe acquired by this dextrous and ſpirited conduct, gave her every
where, abroad as well as at home, more authority than had attended her
ſiſter, tho' ſupported by all the power of the Spaniſh monarchy<note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes, vol. I. p. 354, 372. Jebb, vol. II. p.
452.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE ſubſequent meaſures of the Scotch reformers tended
ſtill more to cement their union with England. Being entirely maſters of
the kingdom, they made no farther ceremony or ſcruple, in fully effecting
their purpoſe. In the treaty of Edinburgh it had been agreed, that a
Parliament or convention ſhould ſoon be aſſembled; and the leaders of
the Congregation, not waiting till the Queen of Scots ſhould ratify that
treaty, thought themſelves fully intitled, without the ſovereign's
authority, immediately to ſummon a Parliament. The reformers preſented a
petition to this aſſembly; where they are not contented with deſiring the
eſtabliſhment of their doctrine; they alſo apply for the puniſhment of
the catholics, whom they call vaſſals to the Roman harlot; and they
aſſert, that, amongſt all the rabble of the clergy, ſuch is their
expreſſion, there is not one lawful miniſter; but that they are, all of
them, thieves and murderers; yea rebels and traitors to civil authority; and
therefore unworthy to be ſuffered in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed common-wealth<note n="†" place="bottom">Knox, p. 237, 238.</note>. The Parliament ſeem to
have been actuated by the ſame ſpirit of rage and perſecution. After
ratifying a confeſſion of faith, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the new doctrines, they
paſſed a ſtatute againſt the maſs, and not only aboliſhed it in all
the churches, but enacted, that whoever any where, either officiated in it or
was preſent at it, ſhould be chaſtiſed, for the firſt offence, with
confiſcation of goods, and corporal puniſhment, at the diſcretion of the
magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; for the ſecond, with baniſhment; and for the third, with
loſs of life<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 254.</note>. A law was
alſo voted for aboliſhing the papal juriſdiction in Scotland: The
preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian form of diſcipline was ſettled, leaving only at firſt
ſome ſhadow of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <pb n="429" facs="tcp:0429000102:32"/> to certain
eccleſiaſtics, whom they called ſuperintendants. The prelates of the
antient faith appeared in order to complain of great injuſtice committed on
them by the invaſion of their property, but the Parliament took no notice of
them; till at laſt, theſe eccleſiaſtics, tired with fruitleſs
attendance, departed the town. They were then cited to appear; and as no body
preſented themſelves, it was voted by the Parliament, that the
eccleſiaſtics were entirely ſatisfied, and found no reaſon of
complaint.</p>
               <p>SIR James Sandilands, prior of St. John, was ſent over to
France to obtain the ratification of theſe acts; but was very ill received by
the Queen, who abſolutely denied the validity of a Parliament, ſummoned
without the royal conſent; and ſhe refuſed her ſanction to theſe
ſtatutes. But the proteſtants gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves little concern about their
Queen's refuſal. They immediately put the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in execution: They
aboliſhed the maſs; they ſettled their miniſters; they committed every
where furious devaſtations on the monaſteries, and even on the churches,
which they thought to be profaned by idolatry; and eſteeming the property of
the clergy lawful prey, they took poſſeſſion, without ceremony, of the
far greater part of the eccleſiaſtical revenues. Their new preachers, who
had authority ſufficient to incite them to war and inſurrection, could not
reſtrain their rapacity; and fanaticiſm concurring with avarice, an
incurable blow was given to the papal authority in that country. The
proteſtant nobility and gentry, united by the conſciouſneſs of ſuch
unpardonable guilt, alarmed for their new poſſeſſions, well acquainted
with the imperious character of the houſe of Guiſe, ſaw no ſafety for
themſelves but in the protection of England; and they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Morton,
Glencarne, and Ledington to expreſs their ſincere gratitude to the Queen
for her paſt favours, and to repreſent to her the neceſſity of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">French affairs.</note> ELIZABETH had equal
reaſon to maintain an union with the Scotch prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; and ſoon found,
that the houſe of Guiſe, notwithſtanding their paſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
had not laid aſide the deſign of conteſting her title, and ſubverting
her authority. Francis and Mary, whoſe councils were wholly directed by them,
refuſed to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh; and ſhowed no diſpoſition to
give her any ſatisfaction for that mortal injury and affront which they had
put upon her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo openly
aſſuming the title and arms of England. She was ſenſible of the danger
attending ſuch pretenſions; and it was with pleaſure ſhe heard of the
violent factions, which prevailed in the French government, and of the
oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had ariſen againſt the meaſures of the duke of
Guile. That ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious prince, ſupported by his four brothers, the cardinal
of Lorraine, the duke of Aumale, the marquis of Elbeuf, and the grand prior,
men no less ambitions <pb n="430" facs="tcp:0429000102:33"/> than himſelf, had engroſſed
all the authority of the crown; and as he was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of every
quality, which could command the eſteem or ſeduce the affections of men,
there appeared no end of this acquiſitions and pretenſions. The
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Montmorency, who had long ballanced his credit, was deprived of
all power: The princes of the blood, the King of Navarre and his brother the
prince of Condé, were entirely excluded from offices and favour: The
Queen-mother herſelf, Catherine de Medicis, found her influence every day
declining. And as Francis, a young prince, infirm both in mind and body, was
wholly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his ſpouſe, who knew no law but the pleaſure of her
uncles, men deſpaired of ever obtaining freedom from the dominion of that
aſpiring family. It was the conteſts of religion, which firſt inſpired
the French with courage openly to oppoſe their exorbitant authority.</p>
               <p>THE theological diſputes, firſt ſtarted in the north of
Germany, and next in Switzerland, countries at that time wholly illiterate, had
long ago penetrated into France; and as they were aſſiſted by the general
diſcontents againſt the court and church of Rome, and by the zealous
ſpirit of the age, the proſelytes to the new religion were ſecretly
encreaſing in every province. Henry the ſecond, in imitation of his father
Francis, had oppoſed the progreſs of the reformers; and tho' a prince
addicted to pleaſure and ſociety, he was tranſported by a vehemence, as
well as bigotry, which had little place in his predeceſſor's conduct.
Rigorous puniſhments had been inflicted on the moſt eminent of the
proteſtant party; and a point of honour ſeemed to have ariſen, whether
the one ſect could exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe or the other ſuffer moſt barbarity. The
death of Henry put ſome ſtop to the perſecutions; and the people, who had
admired the conſtancy of the new preachers, now heard with favour and
prepoſſeſſion their arguments and doctrines. But the cardinal of
Lorraine, as well as his brother, who were poſſeſſed of the legal
authority, thought it their intereſt to ſupport the eſtabliſhed
religion; and when they revived the exerciſe of the penal ſtatutes, they
neceſſarily engaged the malecontent princes and nobles in the protection of
the new religion. The King of Navarre, a man of mild diſpoſitions, but of a
weak character, and the prince of Condé, who poſſeſſed many
heroic qualities, having declared themſelves in favour of the proteſtants,
that ſect acquired new force from their countenance; and the admiral de
Coligni, with his brother Andelot, no longer ſcrupled to declare themſelves
openly of their communion. The integrity of the admiral, who was believed
ſincere in his proſeſſion, and his high renown both for valour and
conduct, for the arts of peace as well as of war, gave credit to the
reſormers; and after a fruſtrated attempt of the malecontents to ſeize
the King's perſon at <pb n="431" facs="tcp:0429000102:34"/> Amboiſe, of which Elizabeth had
probably ſome intelligence<note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes, vol. I. p. 214.
Throemorton, about this time, unwilling to entruſt to letters the great
ſecrets committed to him, obtained leave, under ſome pretext, to come over
to London.</note>, every place was full of diſtraction, and matters
haſtened to an extremity between the parties. But the houſe of Guiſe,
tho' theſe factions had obliged them to remit their efforts in Scotland, and
had been one chief cauſe of Elizabeth's ſucceſs, were determined not to
relinquiſh their authority in France, or yield to the violence of their
anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts. 
<note place="margin">4 December.</note> They found an opportunity
to ſeize the King of Navarre and the prince of Conde; they threw the former
into priſon; they obtained a ſentence of death againſt the latter;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1561</label> and they were proceeding to put the
ſentence in execution, when the King's ſudden death ſaved the noble
priſoner, and interrupted the proſperity of the duke of Guiſe. The
Queen-mother was appointed regent to her ſon Charles the ninth, now in his
minority: The King of Navarre was named lieutenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general of the kingdom: The
ſentence againſt Condé was annulled: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable was recalled
to court: And the family of Guiſe, tho' they ſtill enjoyed great offices,
and great power, now found a counterpoiſe to their authority.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH was not diſſatisfied to learn, that her avowed
enemies had met with ſo ſevere a check, and ſhe was determined to make
advantage of it againſt the Queen of Scots, whom ſhe ſtill regarded as a
dangerous rival. She ſaw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf freed from the perils attending an union
of Scotland with France; and was pleaſed to find, that ſo powerful a prince
as the French monarch was no longer a pretender to her crown and kingdoms. But
ſhe conſidered, on the other hand, that the Engliſh catholics, who were
very numerous, and who were generally prejudiced in favour of Mary's title,
would now adhere to that princeſs with more zealous attachment, when they
ſaw, that her ſucceſſion no longer endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the liberties of the
kingdom, and was rather attended with the advantages of producing an entire
union with Scotland. She gave orders, therefore, to her ambaſſador,
Throcmorton, a very vigilant and able miniſter, to renew his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to
the Queen of Scots, and to require her ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh.
But tho' Mary had deſiſted, after her huſband's death, from bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
arms and title of Queen of England, ſhe ſtill declined gratifying
Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth in this momentous article; and hearkening too much to the ambitious
ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of her uncles, ſhe refuſed to make any formal renunciation
of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions.</p>
               <p>MEANWHILE, the Queen-mother of France, who imputed to Mary all
the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications which ſhe had met with during Francis's life-time, took
care to retaliate on her by like injuries; and the Queen of Scots, who found
her abode in France <pb n="432" facs="tcp:0429000102:35"/> diſagreeable, began to think of
returning into her native country. Lord James, who had been ſent in
deputation from the ſtates to invite her over, ſeconded this intention; and
ſhe applied to Elizabeth, by D'Oiſel, for liberty to paſs thro'
England<note n="*" place="bottom">Goodall, vol. I. p. 175.</note>. But ſhe
received for anſwer, that till ſhe had given ſatisfaction, by ratifying
the treaty of Edinburgh, ſhe could expect no favour from a perſon whom
ſhe had ſo much injured. This denial excited her reſentment; and ſhe
made no ſcruple of expreſſing her ſentiments to Throcmorton, when he
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated his applications to gratify his miſtreſs in a demand, which he
repreſented as ſo reaſonable. Having cleared the room of all her
attendants, ſhe ſaid to him, 
<q rend="inline">"How weak I may prove, or how far a woman's
frailty may tranſport me, I cannot tell: However, I have no mind to have ſo
many witneſſes of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity as your miſtreſs had at her audience of
my ambaſſador, D'Oiſel. There is nothing diſturbs me ſo much, as the
having aſked, with ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, a favour which it was of no
conſequence for me to obtain. I can, with God's leave, return to my own
country without her leave; as I came to France, in ſpite of all the
oppoſition of her brother, King Edward: Neither do I want friends, both able
and willing, to conduct me home, as they have brought me hither; tho' I was
deſirous rather to make an experiment of her friendſhip than of the
aſſiſtance of any other perſon. I have often heard you ſay, that a
good correſpondence between her and myſelf would conduce much to the
ſecurity and happineſs of both our kingdoms: But were ſhe well convinced
of this truth, ſhe had hardly denied me ſo ſmall a requeſt. But,
perhaps, ſhe bears a better inclination to my rebellious ſubjects than to
me, their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, her equal in royal dignity, her near relation, and the
undoubted heir of her kingdoms. Beſides her friendſhip, I aſk nothing at
her hands: I neither trouble her, nor concern myſelf in the affairs of her
kingdom: Not that I am ignorant, that there are now in England a great many
malecontents, who are no friends to the preſent eſtabliſhment. She is
pleaſed to upbraid me as a perſon little experienced in the world: I freely
own it; but age will cure that defect. However, I am old enough to acquit
myſelf honeſtly and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to my friends and relations, and to
encourage no reports of her, which would miſbecome a Queen and her
kinſwoman. I would alſo ſay, by her leave, that I am a Queen as well as
ſhe, and not altogether friendleſs: And, perhaps, I have as great a ſoul
too; ſo that methinks we ſhould be upon a level in our treatment of each
other. As ſoon as I have conſulted the ſtates of my kingdom, I ſhall be
ready to give a reaſonable anſwer; and I am the more intent on my journey,
that I may be able to make the quicker diſpatch in this <pb n="433" facs="tcp:0429000102:36"/>
affair. But ſhe, it ſeems, intends to ſtop my journey; ſo that either
ſhe will not let me give her ſatisfaction, or is reſolved not to be
ſatisfied; perhaps, on purpoſe to keep up the diſagreement betwixt us.
She has often reproached me with my being young; and I muſt be very young,
indeed, and as ill adviſed, to treat of matters of ſuch great concern and
importance, without the advice of my Parliament. I have not been wanting in any
friendly offices to her; but ſhe diſbelieves or overlooks them. I could
heartily wiſh, that I was as near allied to her in affection as in blood: For
that, indeed, would be a moſt valuable alliance.<note n="*" place="bottom">Caballa, p 374. Spotſwood, p. 177.</note>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>SUCH a ſpirited reply, notwithſtanding the obliging terms
interſperſed in it, was but ill fitted to conciliate friendſhip between
theſe rival princeſſes, or cure thoſe mutual jealouſies which had
already taken place. Elizabeth equipped a fleet, under pretence of purſuing
pyrates, but probably with an intention of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting the Queen of Scots in
her return homewards. 
<note place="margin">19th Auguſt.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Arrival of Mary in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> Mary
embarked at Calais; and paſſing the Engliſh fleet in a fog, arrived
ſafely at Leith, attended by her three uncles, the duke of Aumale, the grand
prior, and the marqueſs of Elbeuf; together with the marqueſs of Damville,
and other French courtiers. This change of abode and ſituation was very
little agreeable to that princeſs. Beſides the natural
prepoſſeſſions in favour of a country in which ſhe had been educated
from her earlieſt infancy, and where ſhe had borne ſo high a rank, ſhe
could not forbear regreting her departure from among that people, ſo
celebrated for their humane and ſociable diſpoſition, and their
reſpectful attachment to their ſovereign, and reflecting on the diſparity
of the ſcene which lay before her. It is ſaid, that after ſhe was
embarked at Calais, ſhe kept her eyes fixed on the coaſt of France, and
never turned them from that beloved object, till darkneſs fell, and
intercepted it from her view. She then ordered a couch to be ſpread for her
under the open air; and charged the pilot, that, if in the morning the land was
ſtill in ſight, he ſhould awake her, and afford her one parting view of
that country in which all her affections were centered. The weather proved very
calm, ſo that the ſhip made little way in the night-time: And Mary had once
more an opportunity of ſeeing the French coaſt. She ſat up on her couch,
and ſtill looking towards the land, often repeated theſe words. 
<q rend="inline">"Farewell, France, farewell; I ſhall never
ſee thee more<note n="†" place="bottom">Keith, p. 179. Jebb, vol. 11. p.
183.</note>."</q> The firſt aſpect, however, of things in Scotland, was
more favourable, if not to her pleaſure and happineſs, at leaſt to her
repoſe and ſecurity, than ſhe had reaſon to apprehend. No ſooner did
the <pb n="434" facs="tcp:0429000102:37"/> French gallies appear off Leith, than people of all
ranks, who had long expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their arrival, flocked towards the ſhore, with
an earneſt impatience to behold and receive their young ſovereign. Some
were led by duty, ſome by intereſt, ſome by curioſity; and all combined
to expreſs their attachment to her, and to inſinuate themſelves into her
confidence, during the commencement of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. She had now
reached the nineteenth year of her age; and the bloom of her youth, and amiable
beauty of her perſon, were farther recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the affability of her
addreſs, the politeneſs of her manners, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of her genius.
Well accompliſhed in all the ſuperficial, but engaging graces of a court,
ſhe afforded, when better known, ſtill more promiſing indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of her
character; and men prognoſticated both humanity from her ſoft and obliging
deportment, and penetration from her taſte in all the refined arts of
muſic, eloquence, and poetry<note n="‡" place="bottom">Buchan. lib.

long been deprived of the preſence of their ſovereign, whom they once
deſpaired ever more to behold among them, her arrival ſeemed to give
univerſal ſatisfaction; and nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared about the court, but
ſymptoms of affection, joy, and feſtivity.</p>
               <p>THE firſt meaſures which Mary embraced, confirmed all the
prepoſſeſſions which had been entertained in her favour. She followed
the advice which ſhe had received in France from D'Oiſel and the biſhop
of Amiens, as well as her uncles; and gave her confidence entirely to the
leaders of the reformed party, who had greateſt influence on the people, and
who, ſhe found, were alone able to ſupport her government. Her brother,
lord James, whom ſhe ſoon after created earl of Murray, obtained the chief
authority; and after him, Liding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſecretary of ſtate, a man of great
ſagacity, had a principal ſhare in her confidence. By the vigour of theſe
mens meaſures ſhe endeavoured to reſtore order and police into the
country, divided by public factions and private feuds; and that fierce and
intractable people, unacquainted with laws and obedience, ſeemed, for a time,
to ſubmit peaceably to her gentle and prudent admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>

there was one circumſtance which blaſted all theſe promiſing

tho' ſhe publiſhed, ſoon after her arrival, a proclamation, requiring
every one to ſubmit to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion, the preachers, and
their adherents, could neither be reconciled to a perſon polluted with ſo

that if ſhe had here met with a refuſal, ſhe would inſtantly have
returned to France, the zealots never would have granted her even that ſmall
indulgence. The cry was,

maſs was a baſtard ſervice of God, the fountain of all impiety, and the
ſource of every evil which abounded in the realm; they diſcovered their
expectations, that ſhe would, ere this time, have preferred truth to her own
pre-conceived opinion, and have renounced her reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which, they
aſſured her, was nothing but abomination and vanity. They ſaid, that the
preſent abuſes of government were ſo enormous, that if a ſpeedy remedy
was not provided, God would not fail in his anger to ſtrike the head and the
tail the diſobedient prince and ſinful people. They required, that ſevere
puniſhment ſhould be inflicted on adulterers and fornicators; and they
concluded with demanding for themſelves, ſome addition both of power and
property<note n="‖" place="bottom">Knox, p. 311, 312.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE ringleader in all theſe inſults on majeſty was John
Knox, who poſſeſſed an uncontrouled authority in the church, and even
in the civil affairs of the nation, and who triumphed in the contumelious
uſage of his ſovereign. His uſual appellation for the Queen was Jezabel;
and tho' ſhe endeavoured, by the moſt gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, to win
his favour, all her inſinuations could gain nothing on his obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heart.
She promiſed him acceſs to her whenever he demanded it; and ſhe even
deſired him, if he found her blameable in any thing, to reprehend her freely
in private, rather than vilify her in the pulpit before all the people; but he
plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told her, that he had a public miniſtry entruſted to him, that if
ſhe would come to church, ſhe ſhould there hear the goſpel of truth,
and that it was not his buſineſs to apply to every individual, nor had he
leiſure for that occupation<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 310.</note>. The
political principles of the man, which he communicated to his brethren, were as
full of ſedition as his theological were of rage and bigotry. Tho' he once
condeſcended ſo far as to tell the Queen, that he would ſubmit to her, in
the ſame manner that Paul did to Nero<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p.
288.</note>; he remained not long in this dutiful ſtrain. He ſaid to her,
that 
<q rend="inline">"Samuel feared not to ſlay Agag, the ſat and
delicate King of Amalek, whom King Saul had ſaved: Neither ſpared Elias
Jezabel's falſe prophets, and Baal's prieſts, tho' King Ahab was preſent.
Phineas," added he, "was no magiſtrate; and yet feared he not to ſtrike
Coſbie and Zimri in the very act of ſilthy fornication. And ſo, madam,
your grace may ſee, that others than chief magiſtrates may lawfully inflict
puniſhment on ſuch crimes as are condemned by the law of God<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 326.</note>."</q> Knox had formerly, during
the reign of Mary of England, wrote a book againſt female ſucceſſion to
the crown: The title of it is, <hi>The firſt blaſt of the trumpet againſt
the monſtrous regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of women.</hi> He was too proud either to recant the
tenets of this book, or <pb n="437" facs="tcp:0429000102:40"/> even to apologize for them; and
his conduct ſhewed, that he thought no more civility than loyalty was due to
any of the female ſex.</p>
               <p>THE whole life of Mary, from the demeanour of theſe men, was
filled with bitterneſs and ſorrow. This ruſtic apoſtle ſcruples not,
in his hiſtory, to inform us, that he once treated her with ſuch
ſeverity, that ſhe loſt all command of her temper, and diſſolved into
tears before him: Yet ſo far from being moved with youth, and beauty, and
royal dignity reduced to that condition, he perſevered in his inſolent
reproofs; and when he relates this incident, he even diſcovers a viſible
pride and ſatisfaction in his own conduct<note n="*" place="bottom">

Some ornaments, which the ladies at that time wore upon their petticoats,
excited mightily the indignation of the preachers, and they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that

               <p>MARY, whoſe age, and condition, and education, invited her to
liberty and cheerfulneſs, was curbed in every amuſement, by the abſurd

grand prior, with the other French nobility, ſoon took their leave of her:
The marqueſs of Elbeuf remained ſome time longer; but after his departure,
ſhe was left alone to the ſociety of her own ſubjects; men at that time
unacquainted with the pleaſures of converſation, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of arts and
civility, and corrupted beyond their uſual ruſticity by a diſmal
fanaticiſm, which rendered them uncapable of all humanity or improvement.
Tho' ſhe had made no attempt to reſtore the ancient religion, her popery
was a ſufficient crime: Tho' her behaviour was hitherto irreproachable, and
her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſweet and engaging, her gaiety and eaſe were interpreted as
ſigns of diſſolute vanity. And to the harſh and prepoſterous uſage
which this princeſs met with, may, in part, be aſcribed thoſe errors of
her ſubſequent conduct, which ſeemed to be ſo little of a piece with
the general tenor of her character.</p>
               <p>THERE happened to the marqueſs of Elbeuf, before his
departure, an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which, tho' frivolous, might enable him to give Mary's
friends in France, a very melancholy idea of her ſituation. This nobleman,
with the earl of Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, and ſome other young courtiers, had been engaged,
after a debauch, to pay a viſit to a woman called Aliſon Craig, who was
known to be liberal of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; <pb n="438" facs="tcp:0429000102:41"/> and becauſe they were denied
entrance, they broke the windows, thruſt open the door, and committed ſome
diſorders, in ſearching for the damſel. It happened that the aſſembly
of the church was ſitting at that time, and they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately took the matter
under their cognizance. In conjunction with ſeveral of the nobility, they
preſented an addreſs to the Queen, which was introduced with this awful
prelude. 
<q rend="inline">"To the Queen's majeſty, and to her ſecret
and great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, her grace's faithful and obedient ſubjects, the
profeſſors of Chriſt Jeſus's holy evangil wiſh the ſpirit of
righteous judgment."</q> The tenor of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was, that the fear of God,
the duty which they owed her grace, and the terrible threatenings denounced by
God againſt every city or country where hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crimes are openly
committed, compelled them to demand the ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch as had
done what in them lay to kindle the wrath of God againſt the whole realm:
That the iniquity of which they complained, was ſo heinous, and ſo
horrible, that they would eſteem themſelves accomplices in it, if they had
been engaged by worldly fear, or ſervile complaiſance, to paſs it over in
ſilence, or bury it in oblivion: That as they owed her grace obedience in the
adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice, ſo were they entitled to require of her, in
return, the ſharp and condign puniſhment of this enormity, which, they
repeated it, might draw down the vengeance of God on the whole kingdom: And
that they inſiſted on it to be her duty to lay aſide all private
affections towards the actors in this heinous crime and enormous villainy, and
without delay bring them to a trial, and inflict the ſevereſt penalties
upon them. The Queen gave a gracious reception to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory addreſs;
but becauſe ſhe probably thought, that breaking the windows of a brothel
merited not ſuch ſevere reprehenſion, ſhe only replied, that her uncle
was a ſtranger, and that he was attended with a young company: But ſhe
ſhould put ſuch order to him and to all others, that her ſubjects
ſhould henceforth have no reaſon to complain. Her paſſing over this
incident ſo ſlightly, was the ſource of great diſcontent, and was
regarded as a proof of the moſt profligate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>SOME of the populace of Edinburgh broke into the Queen's chappel
during her abſence, and committed ſome outrages; for which two of them were
indicted, and it was intended to bring them to a trial. Knox wrote circular
letters to the moſt conſiderable zealots of the party, and charged them to
appear in town, and protect their brethren. The holy ſacraments, he there
ſaid, are abuſed by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <pb n="439" facs="tcp:0429000102:42"/> papiſts; the maſs
has been ſaid; and in worſhiping that idol, the prieſts have omitted no
ceremony, not even the conjuring of their accurſed water, that had ever been
practiſed in the time of the greateſt blindneſs. Theſe violent
meaſures for oppoſing juſtice differed little from rebellion; and Knox
was ſummoned before the council to anſwer for his offence. The courage of
this man was equal to his inſolence. He ſcrupled not to tell the Queen,
that the peſtilent papiſts, who had enflamed her againſt theſe holy
men, were the ſons of the devil; and muſt therefore obey the directions of
their father, who had been a liar and a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer from the beginning. The
matter ended with the full acquital of Knox<note n="*" place="bottom">Knox, p.

               <p>WE have related theſe circumſtances at greater length, than
the neceſſity of our ſubject may ſeem to require: But even trivial
incidents, which ſhow the manners of the age, are often more inſtructive,
as well as entertaining, than the great tranſactions of wars and
negotiations, which are pretty ſimilar in all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods and in all countries
of the world.</p>
               <p>THE reformed clergy in Scotland had, at that time, a very
natural reaſon for their ill humour, viz. the poverty or rather beggary to
which they were reduced: The nobility and gentry had at firſt laid their
hands on all the property of the regular clergy, without making any proviſion
for the friars and nuns, whom they turned out of all their poſſeſſions.
The ſecular clergy of the catholic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, tho' they loſt all
eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, ſtill held ſome of the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of
their benefices; and either became laymen themſelves, and converted them into
perpetual property, or made conveyance of them at low prices to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
who thus enriched themſelves by the plunder of the church. The new teachers
had hitherto ſubſiſted chiefly by the voluntary oblations of the
faithful; and in a poor country, divided in religious ſentiments, this
eſtabliſhment was regarded as very ſcanty and very precarious. Repeated
applications were made for a le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſettlement to the preachers; and tho' almoſt every thing in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was governed by their zeal and caprice, it was with difficulty that their
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was at laſt complied with. The fanatical ſpirit which they
indulged, and then induſtry in decrying the principles and practices of the
Romiſh communion, which placed ſuch a merit in enriching the clergy, proved
now a very ſenſible obſtacle to their acquiſitions. The boundaries of
the royal power were, during <pb n="440" facs="tcp:0429000102:43"/> that age, more uncertain in
Scotland than even in England; and the privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil alone thought
themſelves intitled, without a Parliament, to regulate this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
matter. They paſſed a vote<note n="*" place="bottom">Knox, p. 296. Keith, p.
210.</note>, by which they divided all the eccleſiaſtical benefices into
twenty one parts: They aſſigned fourteen to the antient poſſeſſors:
Of the remaining ſeven, they granted three to the crown; and if that was
found to anſwer the public expences, they beſtowed the overplus on the
reformed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. The Queen was empowered to levy the whole ſeven; and
it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that ſhe ſhould afterwards pay to the clergy what
ſhould be judged to ſuffice for their maintenance. The neceſſities of
the crown, the rapacity of the courtiers, and the ſmall affection which Mary
bore the proteſtant eccleſiaſtics, rendered their revenues very
contemptible as well as uncertain; and the preachers, finding that they could
not rival the gentry, nor even the middling rank of men in opulence and plenty,
were neceſſitated to betake themſelves to other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients for
ſupporting their authority. They affected a furious zeal for religion,
moroſe manners, a vulgar and familiar, and yet myſterious, cant; and tho'
the liberality of ſubſequent princes put them afterwards on a better
footing with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to revenue and thereby corrected in ſome degree theſe
vicious habits; it muſt be confeſſed, that, while many other advantages
attend preſbyterian government, theſe inconveniencies are not eaſily
ſeparated from the genius of that eccleſiaſtical polity.</p>
               <p>THE Queen of Scots, deſtitute of all force, poſſeſſing
a narrow revenue, ſurrounded with a factious turbulent nobility, a bigoted
people, and inſolent eccleſiaſtics, ſoon found, that her only expedient
for maintaining tranquillity was to preſerve a good correſpondence with 
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Jebb, vol. II. p. 456.</note>
Elizabeth, who by former engagements and ſervices, had acquired ſuch
authority over all theſe ranks of men. Soon after her arrival in Scotland,
ſecretary Lidington was ſent to London, in order to pay her compliments to
the Queen, and expreſs her deſire of friendſhip and a good
correſpondence; and he received a commiſſion from her, as well as from
the Scotch nobility, to demand, as a means of cementing this friendſhip, that
Mary ſhould, by act of Parliament or by Proclamation (for the difference
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe ſecurities was not then eſteemed very conſiderable) be
declared ſucceſſor to the crown. No requeſt could be more
unreaſonable, or made at a more improper juncture. The Queen replied, that
Mary had once diſcovered her intention not to wait for the ſucceſſion,
but had openly, without ceremony or reſerve, aſſumed the title of Queen
of England, and had pretended ſuperior right to her throne and kingdom: That
tho' her ambaſſadors, and thoſe of her huſband, the French King, had
ſigned a treaty, where they renounced that claim, and promiſed
ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for ſo great an indignity, ſhe was ſo intoxicated with
this imaginary <pb n="441" facs="tcp:0429000102:44"/> right, that ſhe had rejected the moſt
earneſt ſollicitations, and even, as ſome endeavoured to perſuade her,
incurred ſome danger in croſſing the ſeas, rather than ratify that
equitable treaty: That her partizans every where had ſtill the aſſurance
to inſiſt on her title, and had preſumed to talk of her own birth as
ſpurious and illegitimate: That while affairs were on this footing; while a
claim thus openly made, ſo far from being openly renounced, was only
ſuſpended till a more convenient opportunity; it would in her be the moſt
egregious impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to fortify the hands of a pretender to her crown, by
declaring her the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor: That no expedient could be worſe imagined
for cementing friendſhip than ſuch a declaration, and Kings were often
ſound to bear no good will to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, even tho' their own
children; much more when the connexion was ſo much leſs intimate, and when
ſuch cauſe of diſguſt and jealouſy had already been given, and indeed
was ſtill centinued, on the part of Mary: That tho' ſhe was willing, from
the amity which ſhe bore her kinſwoman, to aſcribe her former
pretenſions to the advice of others, by whoſe direction ſhe was then
governed; her refuſal to relinquiſh them could proceed only from her own
prepoſſeſſions, and were a proof that ſhe ſtill retained ſome
dangerous project againſt her: That it was the nature of all men to be
diſguſted with the preſent, to entertain flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing views of futurity,
to think their ſervices ill rewarded, to expect a better recompence from the
ſucceſſor; and ſhe would eſteem herſelf ſcarce half a
ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign over the Engliſh, if they ſaw her declare her heir, and arm
her rival with authority againſt her own repoſe and ſafety: That ſhe
knew the inconſtant nature of the people; ſhe was acquainted with the
preſent diviſions in religion; ſhe was not ignorant, that the ſame
party, which expected greateſt favour during the reign of Mary, did alſo
imagine, that the title of that princeſs was ſuperior to her own: That for
her part, whatever claims were advanced, ſhe was determined to live and die
Queen of England; and after her death, it was the buſineſs of others to
examine who had the beſt pretenſions, either by the laws or by right of
blood, to the ſucceſſion: That ſhe hoped the Queen of Scots's claim
would then be found preſerable; and conſidering the injury, which ſhe
herſelf had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it was ſufficient indulgence, if ſhe premiſed,
in the mean time, to do nothing which might, in any reſpect, weaken or
invalidate that claim: And that Mary, if her title was really ſuperior, a
point, which, for her own part, ſhe had never enquired into,
poſſeſſed all advantages above her rivals; who, deſtitute both of
preſent power, and of all ſupport by friends, would only expoſe
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to inevitable ruin, by advancing any weak, or even doubtful
pretenſions<note n="*" place="bottom">Buchanan, lib. XVII. c. 14-17.

                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:0429000102:45"/> THESE views of the Queen were ſo prudent
and judicious, that there was no likelihood of her ever departing from them:
But that ſhe might put the matter to a fuller proof, ſhe offered to explain
the words of the treaty of Edinburgh, ſo as to leave no ſuſpicion of
their excluding Mary's right of ſucceſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 181.</note>; and in this form, ſhe again
required her to ratify that treaty. Matters at laſt came to this iſſue,
that Mary agreed to the propoſal, and offered to renounce all preſent
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to the crown of England, provided Elizabeth would agree to
declare her the ſucceſſor<note n="†" place="bottom">Haynes, vol. I.
p. 377.</note>. But ſuch was the jealous character of this latter princeſs,
that ſhe never would conſent to ſtrengthen the intereſt and authority
of any claimant, by fixing the ſucceſſion; much leſs would ſhe make
this conceſſion in favour of a rival Queen, who poſſeſſed ſuch
plauſible pretenſions for the preſent, and who, tho' ſhe might verbally
reſign them, could eaſily reſume her title on the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.
Mary's demand, however, bore ſo ſpecious an appearance of equity and
juſtice, that Elizabeth, ſenſible that reaſon would be deemed to lie
entirely on that ſide, made no more mention of the matter; and tho' no
farther conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were made by either Princeſs, they put on all the
appearances of a cordial reconcilement and friendſhip with each other. 
<note place="margin">Wiſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> The
Queen obſerved, that, even without her interpoſal, Mary was ſufficiently
depreſſed by the mutinous diſpoſition of her own ſubjects; and
inſtead of giving Scotland, for the preſent, any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude or
diſturbance, ſhe employed herſelf, much more uſefully and laudably, in
regulating the affairs of her own kingdom, and promoting the happineſs of her

the crown: ſhe regulated the coin, which had been extremely debaſed by her

her example in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; introduced into the kingdom the art of making
gun-powder and braſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; fortified her frontiers on the ſide of
Scotland; made frequent reviews of the militia; encouraged agriculture by
allowing a free exportation of corn; promoted trade and navigation; and ſo
much encreaſed the ſhipping of her kingdom, both by building veſſels of

believed, that ſhe would perſevere forever in that reſolution. The

Caſimir, ſon to the elector palatine, made applications to her; and as this
latter prince made profeſſion of the reformed religion, he thought
himſelf, on this account, better intitled to ſucceed in his addreſſes.
Eric, King of Sweden, and Adolph, duke of Holſtein, were encouraged by the
ſame views to become ſuitors; and the earl of Arran, heir to the crown of
Scotland, was, by the ſtates of that kingdom, recommended to her as a
ſuitable marriage. Even ſome of her own ſubjects, tho' they did not
openly declare their pretenſions, entertained hopes of ſucceſs. The earl
of Arundel, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon declining in years, but deſcended from a very antient
and noble family, as well as poſſeſſed of great riches, flattered
himſelf with this proſpect; as did alſo Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Pickering, a man
much eſteemed for his perſonal merit. But the perſon moſt likely to
ſucceed, was a younger ſon of the late duke of Northumberland, the lord
Robert Dudley, who, by means of his exterior qualities, joined to addreſs and
flattery, had become, in a manner, her declared favourite, and had great
influence in all her councils. The leſs worthy he appeared of this
diſtinction, the more was his great favour aſcribed to ſome violent
affection, which could thus ſeduce the judgment of this penetrating
princeſs; and men long expected, that he would obtain the preference above
ſo many princes and monarchs. But the Queen gave all theſe ſuitors a
gentle refuſal, which ſtill encouraged their purſuit; and ſhe thought,
that ſhe ſhould the better attach them to her intereſts, if they were
ſtill allowed to entertain hopes of ſucceeding in their pretenſions. It
is alſo probable, that this policy was not entirely free from a mixture of
female coquetry; and that, tho' ſhe was determined in her own mind never to
ſhare her power with any man, ſhe was not diſpleaſed with the
courtſhip, ſollicitation, and profeſſions of love, which the deſire
of acquiring ſo valuable a prize, procured her from all quarters.</p>
               <p>WHAT is moſt ſingular in the conduct and character of
Elizabeth, is, that, tho' ſhe was determined never to have any heir of her
own body, ſhe was not only extremely averſe to ſix any ſucceſſor to
the crown; but ſeems alſo to have reſolved, as far as lay in her power,
that no one, who had pretenſions to the ſucceſſion, ſhould ever have
any heirs or ſucceſſors. After the excluſion given by 
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:0429000102:47"/> the will of Henry VIII. to the poſterity of Margaret,
Queen of Scotland, the right to the crown devolved on the houſe of Suffolk;
and the lady Catherine Gray, younger ſiſter to the lady Jane, was now the
heir of that family. This lady had been married to the lord Herbert, ſon to
the earl of Pembroke; but having been divorced from that nobleman, ſhe had
entered into a private contract with the earl of Hartford, ſon to the
protector; and her huſband, ſoon after conſummation, travelled into
France. In a little time ſhe appeared to be preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which ſo enraged
Elizabeth, that ſhe threw her into the Tower, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned him to appear,
in order to anſwer for his miſdemeanor. He made no ſcruple to acknowlege
the marriage, which, tho' concluded without the Queen's conſent, was entirely
ſuitable to both parties; and for this offence he was alſo committed to the
Tower. Elizabeth's ſeverity ſtopped not here: She iſſued a
commiſſion to enquire into the matter; and as Hartford could not, within
the time limited, prove the nuptials by witneſſes, their commerce was
declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and their poſterity illegitimate. They were ſtill
continued in cuſtody; but by bribing their keepers, they found means to have
farther intercourſe; and another child appeared to be the fruit of their
commerce. This was a freſh ſource of vexation to the Queen; who made a fine
of fifteen thouſand pounds be ſet on Hartford by the Star-Chamber, and
ordered his confinement to be thenceforth ſtill more rigid and ſevere. He
lay in this condition for nine years, till the death of his wife, by freeing
Elizabeth from all fears, procured him his liberty<note n="*" place="bottom">Haynes, vol. I. p. 369, 378, 396. Camden, p. 389. Heylin, p.
154.</note>. This extreme ſeverity muſt be accounted for, either by the
unrelenting jealouſy of the Queen, who was afraid that any pretender to the
ſucceſſion would acquire credit by having iſſue; or by her malignity,
which, with all her great qualities, made one ingredient in her character, and
which led her to envy in others thoſe natural pleaſures of love and
poſterity, of which her own ambition and deſire of dominion made her
renounce all proſpect for herſelf.</p>
               <p>THERE happened, about this time, ſome other events in the
royal family, where the Queen's conduct was more laudable. Arthur Pole, and his
brother, nephews to the late cardinal, and deſcended from the duke of
Clarence, brother to Edward the fourth, together with Anthony Forteſcue, who
had married a ſiſter of theſe gentlemen, and ſome other perſons, were
brought to their trial for conſpiring to withdraw into France, with a view of
receiving ſuccours from the duke of Guiſe, of returning thence into Wales,
and proclaiming Mary Queen of England, and Arthur Pole duke of Clarence. They
confeſſed the indictment, <pb n="445" facs="tcp:0429000102:48"/> but aſſerted, that they
never intended to execute theſe projects during the Queen's life-time: They
had only eſteemed ſuch precautions requiſite in caſe of her death,
which, ſome pretenders to judicial aſtrology had aſſured them, they
might with certainty look for before the year expired. They were condemned by
the jury; but received their pardon from the Queen's clemency<note n="‖" place="bottom">Strype, vol. I. p. 333. Heylin, p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

commencement of the religious wars in France, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that
flouriſhing kingdom, during the courſe of near forty years, a ſcene of
horror and devaſtation, the great rival powers in Europe were Spain and
England; and it was not long before an animoſity, firſt political, then
perſonal, broke out between the ſovereigns of theſe countries.</p>
               <p>PHILIP the ſecond of Spain, tho' he reached not any enlarged
views of policy, was endowed with great induſtry and ſagacity, a remarkable
caution in his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, an unuſual foreſight in all his meaſures;
and as he was ever cool and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by paſſion, and poſſeſſed
neither talents nor inclination for war, both his ſubjects and his neighbours
had reaſon to expect great juſtice, happineſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, from his
adminiſtration. But prejudices had on him a more pernicious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than ever
paſſions had on any other monarch; and the ſpirit of bigotry and tyranny,
by which he was actuated, with the fraudulent maxims which governed his
councils, excited the moſt violent agitation among his own people, engaged
him in acts of the moſt enormous cruelty, and threw all Europe into
combuſtion.</p>
               <p>AFTER Philip had concluded peace at Cambray, and had remained
ſome time in the Netherlands, in order to ſettle the affairs of that
country, he embarked for <pb n="446" facs="tcp:0429000102:49"/> Spain; and as the gravity of
that nation, with their reſpectful obedience to their prince, had appeared
much more agreeable to his humour, than the homely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar manners, and the
pertinacious liberty of the Flemiſh, it was expected, that he would reſide
altogether at Madrid, and govern all his extenſive dominions by Spaniſh
miniſters and Spaniſh councils. Having met with a violent tempeſt on his
voyage, he no ſooner arrived in harbour, than he fell on his knees, and after
giving thanks for this deliverance, he vowed, that his life, which was thus
providentially ſaved, ſhould be thenceforth entirely dedicated to the
extirpation of hereſy<note n="*" place="bottom">Thuanus, lib. xxiii. cap. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>. His ſubſequent conduct
correſponded to theſe profeſſions. Finding that the new doctrines had
penetrated into Spain, he let looſe the rage of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt all
who profeſſed them, or were ſuſpected of adhering to them; and by his
violence he gave new edge, even to the unrelenting cruelty of prieſts and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors. He committed to cuſtody Conſtantine Ponce, who had been
confeſſor to his father, the emperor Charles; who had attended him during
his retreat; and in whoſe arms that great monarch had terminated his life:
And after this ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtic died in priſon, he ſtill ordered him to be
tried and condemned for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and his ſtatue to be committed to the
flames. He even deliberated, whether he ſhould exerciſe like ſeverity
againſt the memory of his father, who was ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, during his latter
years, to have indulged a propenſity towards the Lutheran principles: In his
furious zeal for orthodoxy, he ſpared neither age, ſex, nor condition: He
was preſent, with an inflexible countenance, at the moſt barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
executions: He iſſued rigorous orders for the proſecution of heretics, in
Spain, Italy, the Indies, and the Low Countries: And having founded his
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined tyranny on maxims of civil policy, as well as on principles of
religion, all his ſubjects ſaw, that there was no method, except the moſt
entire compliance, or moſt obſtinate reſiſtance, to eſcape or elude
the ſeverity of his vengeance.</p>
               <p>DURING that extreme animoſity which prevailed between the
adherents of the oppoſite religions, the civil magiſtrate, who found it
difficult, if not impoſſible, for the ſame laws to govern ſuch enraged
adverſaries, was naturally led by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rules of prudence, in embracing
one party, to declare war againſt the other, and to exterminate, by fire and
ſword, thoſe bigots, who, from abhorrence of his religion, had proceeded to
an oppoſition of his power, and to an hatred of his perſon. If any prince
poſſeſſed ſuch enlarged views as to foreſee, that a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
toleration would in time abate the fury of religious prejudices, he yet met
with difficulties in reducing this principle to practice; and might deem the
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady too violent to await a remedy, which, tho' certain, muſt
neceſſarily be ſlow in its operations. But Philip, tho' a profound
hypocrite, and extremely govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="447" facs="tcp:0429000102:50"/> by ſelf-intereſt,
ſeems alſo to have been himſelf actuated by an imperious bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry; and as
he employed great reflection in all his conduct, he could eaſily palliate the
gratification of his natural temper under the colour of wiſdom, and find in
this ſyſtem no leſs advantage to his foreign than his domeſtic
politics. By placing himſelf at the head of the catholic party, he converted
the zealots of the ancient faith into partizans of the Spaniſh greatneſs;
and by employing the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful allurement of religion, he ſeduced every where
the ſubjects from that allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which they owed their native
ſovereign.</p>
               <p>THE courſe of events, guiding and concurring with choice, had
placed Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth in a ſituation diametrically oppoſite; and had raiſed
her to be the glory, the bulwark, and the ſupport of the numerous, tho'
ſtill perſecuted proteſtants, throughout all Europe. More moderate in her
temper than Philip, ſhe found, with pleaſure, that the principles of her
ſect required not ſuch extreme ſeverity in her domeſtic government, as
was exerciſed by that monarch; and having no object but
ſelf-preſervation, ſhe united her intereſts in all foreign negociations
with thoſe who were every where ſtruggling under oppreſſion, and
guarding themſelves againſt ruin and extermination. The more virtuous
ſovereign was thus happily thrown into the more favourable cauſe; and
fortune, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, concurred with policy and nature.</p>
               <p>DURING the life-time of Henry the ſecond and his
ſucceſſor, the force of theſe principles was ſomewhat reſtrained,
tho' not altogether overcome, by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a ſuperior intereſt; and
the dread of uniting England with the French monarchy, engaged Philip to
maintain a good correſpondence with Elizabeth. Yet even during this period he

to appear, and the intereſts of Spain and England were found oppoſite in
every negociation and tranſaction.</p>
               <p>THE two great monarchies of the continent, France and Spain,
being poſſeſſed of nearly equal force, were naturally antagoniſts;
and England, from its power and ſituation, was intitled to ſupport its own

therefore, tended too much to depreſs any one of theſe rival powers, as it
left the other without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, might be deemed contrary to the intereſt of
England: Yet ſo much were theſe great maxims of policy over-ruled, during

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Civil wars of France.</note> THE Queen-regent
of France, when re-inſtated in authority by the death of her ſon, Francis,
had formed a plan of adminiſtration more ſubtile than judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; and
ballancing the Catholics with the Hugonots, the duke of Guiſe with the prince
of Condé, ſhe endeavoured to render herſelf neceſſary to both,
and to eſtabliſh her own dominion on their conſtrained obedience<note n="‡" place="bottom">Davila, lib. ii.</note>. But the equal
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe of power, which, among foreign nations, is the ſource of
tranquillity, proves always the ground of quarrel between domeſtic factions;
and if the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity of religion concur with the frequent occaſions which
preſent themſelves of mutual injury, it is impoſſible, during any time,
to preſerve a firm concord in ſo delicate a ſituation. The conſtable,
Montmorency, moved by concern for the ancient faith, joined himſelf to the
duke of Guiſe: The King of Navarre, from his inconſtant temper, and his
jealouſy of the ſuperior genius of his brother, embraced the ſame party:
And Catherine, finding herſelf depreſſed by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, had
recourſe to Condé and the hugonots, who gladly embraced the
opportunity of fortifying themſelves by her countenance and protection<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. lib. iii.</note>. An edict had been publiſhed, granting a
toleration to the proteſtants; but the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted violence of the duke of
Guiſe, covered with the pretence of religious zeal, broke thro' this
agreement; and the two parties, after the fallacious tranquillity of a moment,
renewed their mutual inſults and injuries. Condé, Coligni, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot,
aſſembled their friends, and flew to arms: Guiſe and Montmorency got
poſſeſſion of the King's perſon, and conſtrained the Queen-regent
to embrace their party: Fourteen armies were levied and put in action in
different places of France<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib.

inteſtine rage and animoſity. The father was divided againſt the ſon;
the brother againſt the brother; and women themſelves, ſacrificing their
humanity as well as their timidity to the religious fury, diſtinguiſhed
themſelves by acts of ferocity and valour<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Wherever the hugonots prevailed, the images were
broke, the altars pillaged, the churches demoliſhed, the monaſteries
conſumed with fire: Where ſucceſs attended the catholics, they burned the
bibles, re-baptized the infants, <pb n="449" facs="tcp:0429000102:52"/> conſtrained married
perſons to paſs anew thro' the ceremony: And plunder, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and
bloodſhed attended equally the triumph of both parties. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of
Paris itſelf, the ſeat of law and juſtice, inſtead of employing its
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to compoſe theſe fatal quarrels, publiſhed an edict, by which
it put the ſword into the hands of the enraged multitude, and empowered the
catholics every where to maſſacre the hugonots<note n="‡" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib. vii. Haynes, p 391.</note>: And it was during
this period, when men began to be ſomewhat enlightned, and in this nation,

been boiling in mens veins, ſeems to have attained its laſt ſtage of
virulence and ferocity.</p>
               <p>PHILIP, who was jealous of the progreſs which the hugonots
made in France, and who dreaded that the contagion would ſpread into the
Low-Country Provinces, had formed a ſecret alliance with the princes of
Guiſe, and had entered into a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concert for the protection of the
ancient faith, and the ſuppreſſion of hereſy. He now ſent ſix
thouſand men, with ſome ſupply of money, to reinforce the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic

confirm this ſuſpicion. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſums of money had been laid out
on the fortifications; long leaſes had been granted of the lands; and many
inhabitants had been encouraged to build and ſettle there, by aſſurances

very wiſely concluded, that could ſhe get poſſeſſion of Havre, a
place which commanded the mouth of the Seine, and was of much greater
importance than Calais, ſhe would eaſily conſtrain the French to execute 
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0429000102:53"/> the treaty, and would have the glory of reſtoring to
the crown that ancient poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, which was ſo much the favourite
of the nation.</p>
               <p>NO meaſure could be more generally odious in France, than the
concluſion of this treaty with Elizabeth. Men were naturally led to compare
the conduct of Guiſe, who had finally chaſed the Engliſh from France, and
had barred theſe dangerous and deſtructive enemies from all acceſs into
it, with the treaſonable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics of Condé, who had again granted
them an entry into the heart of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The prince had the more reaſon
to repent of this meaſure, that he reaped not from it all the advantage which
he expected. Three thouſand Engliſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately took poſſeſſion of
Havre and Dieppe, under the command of Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Poinings; but the latter
place was found ſo little capable of being defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was immediately
abandoned<note n="†" place="bottom">Forbes, vol. II. p. 199.</note>. The
ſiege of Rouen was already formed by the catholics, the command of the King

Poinings could throw a ſmall reinforcement into the place. Tho' theſe

during the ſiege; the catholics ſtill continued the attack of the place,
and carrying it at laſt by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, put the whole garriſon to the

ſucceſs at Rouen, would immediately have formed the ſiege of Havre, which
was not as yet in any condition of defence; but the inteſtine diſorders of
the kingdom ſoon diverted their attention to another enterprize. Andelot,
ſeconded by the negociations of Elizabeth, had levied a conſiderable body
of proteſtants in Germany; and having arrived at Orleans, the ſeat of the
hugonots' power, he enabled the prince of Condé and the admiral to take
the field, and oppoſe the progreſs of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. After threatening
Paris during ſome time, they took their march towards Normandy, with a view
of engaging the Engliſh to act in conjunction with them, and of fortifying
themſelves with the farther aſſiſtance which they expected from the
zeal and vigour of Elizabeth<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 230.

aſſiſting the French hugonots, had emptied the Queen's exchequer,
notwithſtanding her extreme frugality; and in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſupply,
ſhe found herſelf under a neceſſity of ſummoning a Parliament: An
expedient to which ſhe never voluntarily had recourſe. A little before the
meeting of this aſſembly, ſhe had fallen into a dangerous illneſs, the
ſmall-pox; and as her life, during ſome time, was deſpaired of, the
people became the more ſenſible of the perilous condition in which they
were placed, on account of the uncertainty which, in caſe of her deceaſe,
attended the ſucceſſion of the crown. The partizans of the Queen of Scots
and thoſe of the houſe of Suffolk, already divided the nation into two
factions; and every one foreſaw, that, tho' it might be poſſible at
preſent to determine the controverſy by law, yet, if the throne was vacant,
nothing but the ſword would be able to fix a ſucceſſor. The commons,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on the very opening of the ſeſſion, voted an addreſs to the
Queen; in which, after enumerating the dangers attending a broken and doubtful
ſucceſſion, and mentioning the evils which their fathers had experienced
from the contending titles of York and Lancaſter, they entreated the Queen to
put an end to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, by chooſing ſome huſband, whom,
they promiſed, whoever he was, gratefully to receive, and faithfully to
ſerve, honour, and obey: Or if ſhe had entertained any reluctance to the
married ſtate, they deſired, that the lawful ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor might be
named, or at leaſt appointed by act of parliament. They remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that
during all the reigns which had paſſed ſince the conqueſt, the nation
had never before been ſo unhappy, as not to know the perſon who, in caſe
of the ſovereign's death, was legally entitled to the ſucceſſion. And
they obſerved, that the certain and fixed order which took place in the
inheritance of the French monarchy, was one chief ſource of the uſual
tranquillity, as well as of the hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pineſs of that kingdom<note n="†" place="bottom">Sir Simon Dewe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS ſubject, tho' extremely intereſting to the nation, was
very little agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Queen; and ſhe was ſenſible, that great
difficulties would attend every deciſion. A declaration in favour of the
Queen of Scots, would form a ſettlement <pb n="452" facs="tcp:0429000102:55"/> perfectly
legal; becauſe that princeſs was commonly allowed to poſſeſs the
right of blood, and the excluſion given by Henry's will, deriving its weight
chiefly from an act of parliament, would loſe all authority whenever the
Queen and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had made a new ſettlement, and reſtored the
Scottiſh line to their place in the ſucceſſion. But ſhe dreaded the
giving encouragement to the catholics, her ſecret enemies, by this
declaration. She was ſenſible, that every heir was, in ſome degree, a
rival; much more one who poſſeſſed a claim for the preſent
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the crown, and who had already advanced, in a very open
manner, theſe dangerous pretenſions. The great power of Mary, both from the
favour of the catholic princes, and her connections with the houſe of
Guiſe, not to mention the force and ſituation of Scotland, was well known
to her; and ſhe ſaw no ſecurity that that princeſs, if fortified by a
ſure proſpect of ſucceſſion, would not again revive claims which
ſhe could never yet be prevailed on formally to relinquiſh. On the other
hand, the title of the houſe of Suffolk was ſupported only by the more
zealous proteſtants; and it was very doubtful, whether even a parliamentary
declaration in its favour would beſtow on it ſuch validity as to give
ſatisfaction to the people. The republican part of the conſtitution had not
as yet acquired ſuch an aſcendant as to controul, in any degree, the ideas
of hereditary right; and as the legality of Henry's will was ſtill
diſputed, tho' founded on the utmoſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which a Parliament could
beſtow; who could be aſſured, that a more recent act would be acknowleged
to have any greater force or validity? In the frequent revolutions which had of
late taken place, the right of blood had ſtill prevailed over religious
prejudices; and the nation had ever ſhewed itſelf diſpoſed rather to
change its faith than the order of ſucceſſion. Even many Proteſtants
declared themſelves in favour of Mary's claim of inheritance<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

than to ſee the Queen openly, and without reſerve, take party againſt it.
That princeſs alſo, finding herſelf injured in ſo ſenſible a point,
would thenceforth act as a declared enemy; and uniting together her fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
and domeſtic friends, the partizans of her preſent title and of her
eventual ſucceſſion, would ſoon bring matters to extremity againſt
the public eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Queen, therefore, weighing all theſe
inconveniencies, which were great and urgent, was determined to keep both
parties in awe, by maintaining ſtill an ambiguous conduct; and ſhe choſe
rather that the people ſhould run the hazard of contingent events, than that
herſelf ſhould viſibly endanger her throne, by employing expedients,
which, at beſt, did not give entire ſecurity to the nation. She made,
therefore, an evaſive anſwer to the applications of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and when
the houſe, at the end of the ſeſſions, deſired, by the mouth 
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:0429000102:56"/> of their ſpeaker, farther ſatisfaction on that head,
ſhe could not be prevailed on to make her reply more explicite. She only told
them, contrary to her declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the beginning of her reign, that ſhe
had fixed no abſolute reſolution againſt marriage; and ſhe added, that
the difficulties with which the queſtion of the ſucceſſion was
attended, were ſo great, that ſhe would be contented, for their ſake, to
remain ſome time longer in this vale of miſery; and never would depart this
life with ſatisfaction, till ſhe had laid ſome ſolid foundation for
their future ſecurity<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Simon D'Ewes's Journal, p.

               <p>THE moſt remarkable law paſſed this ſeſſion, was

By this act, the aſſerting twice by writing, word, or deed, the pope's
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, was ſubjected to the penalties of treaſon. All perſons in
holy orders were bound to take the oath of ſupremacy; as alſo, all who were
advanced to any degrees, either in the univerſities or in common law; all
ſchoolmaſters, officers in court, or members of Parliament: And the penalty
of their ſecond refuſal was treaſon. The firſt offence in both caſes,
was puniſhed by baniſhment and forfeiture. This rigorous ſtatute, which
involved a real, tho' not general, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and of the worſt kind too,
as it made a ſcrutiny into mens ſecret ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was not extended to
any of the degree of a baron; becauſe it was not ſuppoſed, that the Queen
could entertain any doubt with regard to the fidelity of perſons
poſſeſſed of ſuch high dignity. The lord Montacute made vigorous
oppoſition to this bill; and aſſerted, in favour of the catholics, that
they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted not, they preached not, they diſobeyed not the Queen, they
cauſed no trouble nor tumults among the people<note n="‡" place="bottom">Strype, vol. I. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

their ſecret conſpiracies had made the Queen and Parliament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their rigour againſt them; tho' it is alſo more than probable, that they
were miſtaken in the nature of the remedy.</p>
               <p>THERE was likewiſe another point where the Parliament, this
ſeſſion, ſhewed more the goodneſs of their intention than the
ſoundneſs of their judgment. They paſſed a law againſt fond and
fantaſtical prophecies, which had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to ſeduce the people

time they enacted a ſtatute which was moſt likely to increaſe theſe and

                     </gap>.</note>. Witchcraft and hereſy are two crimes which always
increaſe by puniſhment, and never are ſo eſſectually ſuppreſſed
as by being totally neglected. After the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <pb n="454" facs="tcp:0429000102:57"/> had
granted the Queen a ſupply of one ſubſidy and two fifteenths, it was
finiſhed by a prorogation. The convocation likewiſe voted the Queen a
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy of ſix ſhillings in the pound, payable in three years.</p>
               <p>WHILE the Engliſh parties exerted theſe calm efforts
againſt each other, in parliamentary votes and debates, the French factions,
enflamed to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of animoſity, continued that cruel war
which their intemperate zeal, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the ambition of their leaders, had
kindled in the kingdom. The admiral was ſucceſsful in reducing the towns of
Normandy which held for the King; but he frequently complained, that the
numerous garriſon of Havre remained totally unactive, and was not employed in
any military operations againſt the common enemy. The Queen, in taking
poſſeſſion of that place, had publiſhed a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto<note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes, vol. II.</note>, in which ſhe pretended, that her
concern for the French King's intereſt, had engaged her in that meaſure,
and that her ſole intention was to oppoſe her enemies of the houſe of
Guiſe, who held their prince in captivity, and employed his power to the
deſtruction of his beſt and moſt faithful ſubjects. It was chiefly her
deſire to preſerve appearances, joined to the great frugality of her
temper, which made her, at this critical juncture, keep her ſoldiers in
garriſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from committing farther hoſtilities upon the
enemy<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 276, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>7.</note>. The duke of Guiſe, meanwhile, was aiming a
mortal blow at the power of the Hugonots; and had commenced the ſiege of
Orleans, which was commanded by Andelot, and where the conſtable was detained
priſoner. He had the proſpect of ſpeedy ſucceſs in this undertaking;
when he was aſſaſſinated by Poltrot, a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whoſe zeal,
inſtigated (as it is pretended, tho' without any certain foundation) by the
admiral and Beza, a famous preacher, led him to attempt that criminal
enterprize. The death of this gallant prince was a very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible loſs to
the catholic party; and tho' the cardinal of Lorraine, his brother, ſtill
ſupported the intereſt of the family, the danger of their progreſs
appeared much leſs imminent, both to Queen Elizabeth and to the French
proteſtants. The union, therefore, between theſe allies, which had been
cemented by their common fears, began thenceforth to be leſs intimate; and
the leaders of the Hugonots were perſuaded to hearken to terms of
accommodation. Condé and Montmorency held conferences for ſettling the
peace; and as they were both of them impatient to relieve themſelves from
captivity, they ſoon came to an agreement with regard to the conditions. The
character of the Queen-regent, whoſe ends were always violent, but who
endeavoured, by ſubtilty and policy, rather than force, to attain them, led
her to embrace any plauſible terms; and in <pb n="455" facs="tcp:0429000102:58"/> ſpite of
the admiral's proteſtations, whoſe ſagacity could eaſily diſcover the
treachery of the court, the articles of agreement were finally ſettled
between the parties. A toleration, under ſome reſtrictions, was anew
granted to the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; a general amneſty was publiſhed;
Condé was reinſtated in his offices and governments; and after money
was advanced for the payment of arrears due to the German troops, they were
diſmiſſed the kingdom.</p>
               <p>BY the agreement between Elizabeth and the prince of
Condé, it had been ſtipulated<note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes, vol II.
p. 79.</note>, that neither party ſhould conclude peace without the conſent
of the other; but this article was at preſent but little regarded by the
leaders of the French proteſtants. They only comprehended her ſo far in the
treaty, as to obtain a promiſe, that, on her relinquiſhing Havre, her
charges and the money which ſhe had advanced them, ſhould be repaid her by
the King of France, and that Calais, on the expiration of the term, ſhould be
reſtored to her. But ſhe diſdained to accept of theſe terms; and
thinking the poſſeſſion of Havre a much better pledge for the obtaining
her purpoſe, ſhe ſent Warwic orders to prepare himſelf againſt an
attack from the now united power of the French monarchy.</p>
               <p>THE earl of Warwic, who commanded a garriſon of ſix
thouſand men, beſide ſeven hundred pioniers, had no ſooner got
poſſeſſion of Havre, than he employed every means for putting it in a
poſture of defence<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 158.</note>; and
after expelling the French from the town, he encouraged his ſoldiers to make
the moſt deſperate defence againſt the enemy. The conſtable commanded
the French army; the Queen-regent herſelf, and the King were preſent in the
camp; even the prince of Condé joined the King's forces, and gave
countenance to this enterprize; the admiral and Andelot alone, who ſtill
deſired to preſerve Elizabeth's friendſhip, kept at a diſtance, and
prudently refuſed to join their antient enemies in an attack upon their
allies.</p>
               <p>BY the force, and diſpoſitions, and ſituation of both
ſides, it was expected, that the ſiege would be attended with ſome very
memorable event; yet did France make a much eaſier acquiſition of this
important place, than was at firſt apprehended. The plague crept in among the
Engliſh ſoldiers; and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by their fatigue and bad diet (for
they were but ill ſupplied with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid p. 337, 498.</note>) it committed ſuch ravages, that
ſometimes an hundred men a day died of it, and there remained not at laſt

She always told the Queen of Scotts, that nothing would ſatisfy her but her

terms during a twelvemonth, ſhe at laſt named the lord Robert Dudley, now 
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:0429000102:61"/> created earl of Leiceſter, as the perſon on whom
ſhe deſired that Mary's choice ſhould fall.</p>
               <p>THE earl of Leiceſter, the great and powerful favourite of
Elizabeth, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed all thoſe exterior qualities, which are
naturally alluring to the fair ſex; a handſome perſon, a polite
addreſs, an inſinuating behaviour; and by means of theſe
accompliſhments, he had been able to blind even the penetration of
Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, and conceal from her the great defects, or rather odious vices,
which attended his character. He was proud, inſolent, intereſted,
ambitious; without honour, without generoſity, without humanity; and attoned
not for theſe bad qualities, by any ſuch abilities or courage, as could fit
him for that high truſt and confidence with which ſhe always honoured him.
Her conſtant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared attachment to him had very naturally emboldened
him to aſpire to her bed; and in order to make way for theſe nuptials, he
was univerſally believed to have murdered, in a barbarous manner, his wife,
the heireſs of one Robeſart. The propoſal of eſpouſing Mary was by no
means agreeable to him; and he always aſcribed it to the contrivance of
Cecil, his enemy; who intended by that artifice to make him loſe the
friendſhip of Mary from the temerity of his pretenſions, and that of
Elizabeth from jealouſy of his attachments to another woman<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 396.</note>. The Queen herſelf had not any ſerious
intention of effecting this marriage; but, as ſhe was deſirous, that the
Queen of Scots ſhould never take any huſband, ſhe named a man, who, ſhe
believed, was not likely to be accepted of; and ſhe hoped, by that means, to
gain time, and elude the project of any other alliance. The earl of Leiceſter
was too great a favourite to be parted with; and when Mary, allured by the
proſpect of being declared ſucceſſor to the crown, ſeemed at laſt
to hearken to Elizabeth's propoſal, this princeſs receded from her former
offers, and withdrew the bait, which ſhe had formerly thrown out to her
rival<note n="†" place="bottom">Keith, p. 269, 270. Appendix, p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

conduct, joined to ſome appearance of an imperious ſuperiority, aſſumed
by her, had drawn a peeviſh letter from Mary; and the ſeemingly ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
correſpondence of the two Queens was during ſome time interrupted. In order
to make up this breach, the Queen of Scots diſpatched Sir James Melvil to
London; who has given us a very particular account of this negociation.</p>
               <p>MELVIL was an agreeable courtier, a man of addreſs and
converſation; and it was recommended to him by his miſtreſs, that,
beſides grave reaſonings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning politics and ſtate-affairs, he
ſhould introduce more entertaining topics of converſation, ſuitable to
the ſprightly character of Elizabeth; and ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by that means
to inſinuate himſelf into her confidence. He ſucceeded ſo 
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0429000102:62"/> well, that he threw that artful princeſs entirely off
her guard<note n="‡" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 447.</note>, and brought
her to diſcover the bottom of her heart, full of all thoſe levities and
follies and ideas of rivalſhip, which poſſeſs the youngeſt and moſt
frivolous of her ſex. He talked to her of his travels, and forgot not to
mention the different dreſſes of the ladies in different countries, and the
particular advantages of each, in ſetting off the beauties of the ſhape and
perſon. The Queen ſaid that ſhe had dreſſes of all countries, and
ſhe took care thenceforth to meet the ambaſſador every day appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in
a different habit: Sometimes ſhe was dreſſed in the Engliſh garb,
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the French, ſometimes in the Italian; and ſhe aſked him,
which of them became her moſt. He anſwered, the Italian; a reply, that he
knew would be agreeable to her, becauſe that mode ſhowed her flowing locks,
which, he remarked, tho' they were more red than yellow, ſhe fancied to be
the fineſt in the world. She deſired to know of him what was reputed the
beſt colour of hair: She aſked whether his Queen's hair or hers was beſt:
She even enquired which of them he eſteemed the faireſt perſon: A very
delicate queſtion, and which he prudently eluded, by ſaying that her
majeſty was the faireſt perſon in England, and his miſtreſs in
Scotland. She next demanded which of them was talleſt: He replied, his queen:
Then, ſaid Elizabeth, ſhe is too tall: For I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf am of a juſt
ſtature. Having learned from him, that his miſtreſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
recreated herſelf by playing on the harpſicord, an inſtrument at which
ſhe herſelf excelled, ſhe gave orders to lord Hunſdon, that he ſhould
lead him, as it were caſually, into an apartment, where he might hear her
performance; and when Melvil, as if raviſhed with the harmony, broke into the
Queen's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe pretended to be diſpleaſed at his intruſion;
but ſtill took care to aſk whether he thought Mary or her the beſt
performer on that inſtrument<note n="*" place="bottom">Melvil, p.

behaviour, Melvil thought he might, on his return, aſſure his miſtreſs

counſellors, and probably herſelf, began to think it full time that ſome
alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance were concluded; and the lord Darnley, ſon to the earl of Lenox, was
the perſon, in whom moſt mens opinions and wiſhes centered. He was Mary's
couſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german, by the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to Harry the eighth, and
daughter to the earl of Angus, by Margaret, Queen of Scotland. He had been born
and educated in England, where the earl of Lenox had conſtantly reſided,
ever <pb n="460" facs="tcp:0429000102:63"/> ſince he had been baniſhed by the prevalence of
the houſe of Hamilton; and as Darnley was now in his twentieth year, and was
a very comely perſon, tall and delicately ſhaped, it was hoped, that he
might ſoon render himſelf agreeable to the Queen of Scots. He was alſo by
his father a branch of the ſame family with herſelf; and would, in
eſpouſing her, preſerve the royal dignity in the houſe of Stuart: He
was, after her, next heir to the crown of England; and thoſe who pretended to
exclude her on account of her being a foreigner, had endeavoured to recommend
his title, and give it the preference. It ſeemed no inconſiderable
advantage, that ſhe could, by marrying him, unite both their claims; and as
he was by birth an Engliſhman, and could not by his power or alliances give
any ground of ſuſpicion to Elizabeth, it was hoped that the propoſal of
this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage would not be unacceptable to that jealous princeſs.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH was well informed of theſe intentions of the court
of Edinburgh<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p. 261.</note>; and was ſecretly
not diſpleaſed with the projected marriage between Darnley and the Queen of
Scots<note n="†" place="bottom">Keith, p. 280, 282. Jebb, vol. II. p.

a ſingle life; but finding little probability of rendering this ſcheme
effectual, ſhe was ſatisfied with a choice, which freed her at once from
the dread of a foreign alliance, and from the neceſſity of parting with
Leiceſter, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. In order to pave the way to Darnley's marriage,
ſhe ſecretly deſired Mary to invite Lenox into Scotland, to reverſe his

eſpouſing him, than ſhe exclaimed againſt the marriage; ſent

reaſons of her conduct, ſcarcely to her miniſters, and ſcarcely even to
herſelf. But beſides a womaniſh rivalſhip and envy againſt the
marriage of this princeſs, ſhe had ſome motives of intereſt for
feigning a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure on the preſent occaſion. It ſerved her as a
pretence for refuſing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege Mary's title to the ſucceſſion of
England; a point to which ſhe was determined never to conſent. And it was
uſeful to her for a purpoſe, ſtill more unfriendly and dangerous, for
encouraging the diſcontents and rebellion of the Scotch nobility and
eccleſiaſtics<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p. 290.</note>.</p>
               <p>NOTHING can be more unhappy for a people than to be governed by
a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, who is attached to a religion different from that which is
eſtabliſhed; and it is ſcarce poſſible, that a mutual confidence can
ever, in ſuch a ſituation, have place between the prince and his
ſubjects. Mary's conduct had been hitherto, in every reſpect,
unexceptionable, and even laudable; yet had ſhe not made ſuch progreſs in
acquiring popularity, as might have been expected from her gracious deportment
and agreeable accompliſhments. Suſpicions every moment prevailed on account
of her attachment to the catholic faith, and eſpecially to her uncles, the
open and avowed promoters of the ſcheme for exterminating the profeſſors
of the reformed religion throughout all Europe. She ſtill refuſed to ratify
the acts of Parliament, which had eſtabliſhed the reformation; ſhe made
attempts for reſtoring to the catholic biſhops ſome part of their civil
juriſdiction<note n="†" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 198.</note>; and
ſhe wrote a letter to the council of Trent, in which, beſides
profeſſing her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the catholic faith, ſhe took notice of her
title to ſucceed to the crown of England, and expreſſed her hopes of
being able, in ſome period, to bring back all her dominions to the boſom of
the church<note n="‡" place="bottom">Father Paul, lib. VII.</note>. The
zealots among the proteſtants were not wanting, in their turn, to practiſe
inſults upon her, which tended ſtill more to alienate her from their faith.
A law was enacted, making it capital, even on the firſt offence, to ſay
maſs any where, except in the Queen's chappel<note n="‖" place="bottom">Keith, p 268.</note>; and it was with great difficulty that this
ſmall indulgence was granted her: The general aſſembly importuned her
anew to change her religion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the blaſphemous idolatry of the
maſs, with the tyranny of the Roman Antichriſt, and to embrace the true
religion of Chriſt Jeſus<note n="§" place="bottom">Keith, p. 545. Knox,

with temper, that ſhe was not yet convinced of the falſhood of her religion
or the impiety of the maſs; and that her apoſtacy would loſe her the

that their religion was <pb n="462" facs="tcp:0429000102:65"/> undoubtedly the ſame which had
been revealed by Jeſus Chriſt, which had been preached by the apoſtles,
and which had been embraced by the faithful in the primitive ages; that neither
the religion of Turks, Jews, nor Papiſts was built on ſo ſolid a
foundation as theirs; that they alone, of all the various ſpecies of
religioniſts ſpread over the face of the earth, were ſo happy as to be
poſſeſſed of the truth; that thoſe who hear, or rather who gaze on
the maſs, allow ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, pronounce blaſphemy, and commit moſt

his credit at court much diminiſhed by the intereſt of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox, and his

which he had obtained from Mary's liberality. The earls of Argyle, Rothes, and
Glencairne, the lords Boyde and Ochiltry, Kirkaldy of Grange, Pittarow, were
inſtigated by like motives; and as theſe were the perſons who had moſt
zealouſly promoted the reformation, they were diſguſted to find that the

               <p>THE baniſhed lords, finding themſelves ſo ill uſed by
Elizabeth, had recourſe to the clemency of their ſovereign; and after
ſome ſollicitation, and ſome profeſſions of ſincere repentance, the
duke of Chatelrault obtained his pardon, on condition that he ſhould retire
into France. Mary was more implacable againſt the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful earl of Murray,
and the other confederates, on whom ſhe threw the chief blame of the
enterprize; but as ſhe was continually plied with applications from their
friends, and as ſome of her moſt judicious partizans in England thought,
that nothing would more promote her intereſts in that kingdom, than the
gentle treatment of men ſo celebrated for their zeal againſt the catholic
religion; ſhe agreed to give way to her natural temper, which inclined not to
ſeverity, and ſhe ſeemed determined to reſtore them to her favour<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. Keith, p. 322.</note>.
In this interval, Rambouillet arrived as ambaſſador from France, and

Rizzio in the court, who had of late obtained a very extraordinary degree of
confidence and favour with the Queen of Scots. He was a Piedmonteſe, of mean

promoted Rizzio to that office, which gave him frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of

ſhrewd and ſenſible, as well as aſpiring, much beyond his rank and
education; and made ſo good uſe of the acceſs which fortune had procured

by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion; all ſuitors were obliged to gain him by preſents

this princeſs been in her kindneſs to Rizzio, that even that ſtrange

atrocious in itſelf, was rendered ſtill more ſo by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which attended its execution. Mary, who was in the ſeventh month of her
pregnancy, was ſupping in private, and had at table the counteſs of Argyle,
her natural ſiſter, with Rizzio, and others of her ſervants. The King
entered the room by a private paſſage, and ſtood at the back of Mary's
chair: The lord Ruthven, George Douglas, and other conſpirators, being all
armed, ruſhed in after him; and the Queen of Scots, terrified with the
appearance, demanded of them the reaſon of this rude intruſion. They told
her, that they intended no violence againſt her perſon; but meant only to
bring that villain, pointing at Rizzio, to his deſerved puniſhment. Rizzio,
aware of the danger, ran behind his miſtreſs, and ſeizing her by the
waiſt, called aloud to her for protection; while ſhe interpoſed in his
behalf, with cries, and menaces, and entreaties. The impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
aſſaſſins, regardleſs of her efforts, ruſhed upon their prey, and
by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning every thing which ſtood in their way, increaſed the horror
and confuſion of the ſcene. Douglas, ſeizing Henry's dagger, ſtuck it
in the body of Rizzio, who, ſcreaming with fear and agony, was torne from
Mary by the other conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, and puſhed into the antichamber, where he
was diſpatched with fifty-ſix wounds<note n="†" place="bottom">Melvil,

informed of his fate, immediately dried her tears, and ſaid, ſhe would weep
no more; ſhe would now think of revenge. The inſult, indeed, upon her
perſon; the ſtain attempted to be fixed on her honour; the danger to which
her life was expoſed, on account of her pregnancy; were injuries ſo
atrocious, and ſo complicated, that they ſcarce left room for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, even
from the greateſt lenity and mercy.</p>
               <p>THE aſſaſſins, apprehenſive of Mary's reſentment,
detained her a priſoner in the palace; and the King diſmiſſed all
thoſe who ſeemed willing to attempt her reſcue, by telling them, that
nothing was done without his orders, and that he would be careful of the
Queen's ſafety. Murray, and the baniſhed lords, appeared two days after;
and Mary, whoſe anger was now engroſſed by injuries more recent and
violent, was willingly reconciled to them; and ſhe even received her brother 
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0429000102:72"/> with tenderneſs and affection. They obtained an
acquital from the Parliament, and were re-inſtated in their honours and
fortunes. The accomplices alſo in Rizzio's murder applied to her for a
pardon; but ſhe artfully delayed compliance, and perſuaded them, that ſo
long as ſhe was detained in cuſtody, and was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by guards, any
deed which ſhe ſhould ſign, would have no force nor validity. Mean while
ſhe had gained the confidence of her huſband, by her perſuaſion and
careſſes; and no ſooner were the guards withdrawn, than ſhe engaged him
to eſcape with her in the night time, and take ſhelter in Dunbar. Many of
her ſubjects here offered her their aſſiſtance; and Mary, having
collected an army, which the conſpirators had no power to reſiſt,
advanced to Edinburgh, and obliged them of fly into England, where they lived
in great poverty and diſtreſs. They made applications, however, to the earl
of Bothwel, a new favourite of Mary's; and that nobleman, deſirous to
ſtrengthen his party by the acceſſion of their intereſt, was able to

               <p>THE vengeance of the Queen of Scots was implacable againſt her
huſband alone, whoſe perſon was before diſagreeable to her, and who, by
his violation of every tie of gratitude and duty, had drawn on him her

aſſaſſins, to deny any concurrence in their crime, even to publiſh a
proclamation containing a falſehood ſo notorious to the whole world<note n="†" place="bottom">Goodall, vol. I. p. 280. Keith, Appen. p.

confidence of any party, ſhe threw him off with diſdain and
indignation<note n="‡" place="bottom">Melvil, p. 66, 67.</note>. As if
ſhe had been making an eſcape from him, ſhe ſuddenly withdrew to Alloa,
a ſeat of the earl of Mar; and when Henry followed her thither, ſhe
returned ſuddenly to Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; and gave him every where the ſtrongeſt
proofs of diſpleaſure, and even of antipathy. She encouraged her courtiers
in their neglect of him; and ſhe was pleaſed, that his mean equipage, and

however, on the reception of the Scotch ambaſſador, ſhe aſſumed her

the matter in the lower houſe, and propoſed that the queſtion of the
ſucceſſion and that of ſupply ſhould go hand in hand; as if it were
intended to conſtrain the Queen to a compliance with the requeſt of her
Parliament<note n="‡" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 179.</note>. The courtiers
endeavoured to elude the debate: Sir Ralph Sadler told the houſe, that he had
heard the Queen poſitively affirm, that, for the good of her people, ſhe
was determined to marry. Secretary Cecil and Sir Francis Knollys gave their
teſtimony to the ſame purpoſe; as did alſo Sir Ambroſe Cave,
chancellor of the dutchy, and Sir Edward Rogers, comptroler of the
houſhold<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note>. Elizabeth's ambitious and maſculine
character was ſo well known, that few members gave any credit to this
intelligence; and it was conſidered merely as an artifice, by which ſhe
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to retract that poſitive affirmation, which ſhe had made in
the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her reign, that ſhe meant to live and die a virgin. The
miniſters therefore gained nothing farther by this piece of policy, but only
to engage the houſe, for the ſake of decency, to join the queſtion of the
Queen's marriage with that of a ſettlement of the crown; and they were
proceeding with great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the debate, and had even appointed a
committee to confer with the lords, when expreſs orders were brought them
from Elizabeth not to proceed farther in that matter. Cecil told them, that
ſhe pledged to the houſe the word of a Queen for her ſincerity in her
intentions to marry; that the appointment of a ſucceſſor would be
attended with great danger to her perſon; that ſhe herſelf had bad
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <pb n="471" facs="tcp:0429000102:74"/> during the reign of her ſiſter, how much
court was paid to the next heir, and what dangerous ſacrifices men were
commonly diſpoſed to make of their preſent duty to their future
proſpects; and that ſhe was therefore determined to delay, till a more
proper opportunity, the deciſion of that important queſtion<note n="§" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 127, 128.</note>. The houſe were not ſatisfied with
theſe reaſons, and ſtill leſs with the command, prohibiting them all
debate on that ſubject. Paul Wentworth, a ſpirited mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, went ſo far
as to queſtion whether ſuch a prohibition were not an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
liberties and privileges of the houſe<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid.
p. 128.</note>. Some even ventured to violate that profound reſpect which
they had hitherto preſerved to the Queen; and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe was bound
in duty, not only to provide for the happineſs of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects during her
own life, but alſo to pay regard to their future ſecurity, by fixing a
ſucceſſor; that by fixing a ſucceſſor; that by a contrary conduct,
ſhe ſhowed herſelf the ſtepmother, not the natural parent, of her
people, and would ſeem deſirous, that England ſhould no longer
ſubſiſt than ſhe ſhould enjoy the glory and ſatisfaction of
governing it; that none but timorous princes, or tyrants, or faint hearted
women, ever ſtood in fear of their ſucceſſors; and that the affections
of the people were a firm and impregnable rampart to every ſovereign, who,
laying aſide all artifice or by ends, had courage and magnanimity to put his
ſole truſt in that honourable and ſure defence<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 400.</note>. The Queen, hearing of theſe debates,
ſent for the ſpeaker, and after reiterating her former prohibition, ſhe
bid him inform the houſe, that, if any member remained ſtill unſatisfied,
he might appear before the privy council, and there give his reaſons<note n="†" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 128.</note>. As the members ſhowed a
diſpoſition, notwithſtanding theſe peremptory orders, ſtill to
proceed upon the queſtion, Elizabeth thought proper, by a meſſage, to
revoke them, and to allow the houſe liberty of debate<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 130.</note>. They were ſo mollified by
this gracious condeſcenſion, that they thenceforth conducted the matter
with more calmneſs and temper; and they even voted her a ſupply, to be
levied at three payments, of a ſubſidy and a fifteenth, without annexing
any condition to it. <label type="milestone">

January.</note> The Queen ſoon after diſſolved the Parliament, and told
them with ſome ſharpneſs in the concluſion, that their proceedings had
contained much diſſimulation and artifice; that under the plauſible
pretences of marriage and ſucceſſion, many of them covered very
malevolent intentions to wards her; but that, however, ſhe reaped this
advantage from their attempts, that ſhe could now diſtinguiſh her friends
from her enemies. 
<q rend="inline">"But do you think," added ſhe, "that I am
unmindful of your future ſecurity, or will be negligent in ſettling the
ſucceſſion? That is the chief object of my concern; as I know myſelf to
be liable to mortality. Or do you apprehend, that I <pb n="472" facs="tcp:0429000102:75"/> meant
to incroach on your liberties? No: It was never my meaning: I only intended to
ſtop you before you approached the precipice. All things have their time; and
tho' you may be bleſſed with a ſovereign more wiſe or more learned than
I, yet I aſſure you, that no one will ever rule over you, who ſhall be
more careful of your ſafety. And therefore, henceforward, whether I live to
ſee the like aſſembly or no, or whoever holds the reins of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
let me warn you to beware of provoking your ſovereign's patience, ſo far as
you have done mine. But I ſhall now conclude, notwithſtanding the
diſguſts I have received (for I mean not to part with you in anger) that
the greateſt part of you may aſſure themſelves that they go home in
their prince's good graces<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 116,

               </p>
               <p>ELIZABETH carried farther her dignity on this occaſion. She
had received the ſubſidy without any condition; but as it was believed,
that the commons had given her that gratuity with a view of engaging her to
yield to their requeſts, ſhe thought proper, on her refuſal, to remit
voluntarily the third payment; and ſhe ſaid, that money in her ſubjects
purſes was as good as in her own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 400.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' the Queen was able to elude, for the preſent, the
applications of Parliament, the friends of the Queen of Scots multiplied every
day in England; and beſides the catholics, many of whom kept treaſonable
correſpondence with her, and were ready to riſe at her command<note n="‡" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 446, 448.</note>, the court itſelf of
Elizabeth was full of her avowed partizans. The duke of Norfolk, the earls of
Leiceſter, Pembroke, Bedford, Northumberland, Sir Nicholas Throcmorton, and
moſt of the conſiderable men in England, except Cecil, ſeemed convinced
of the neceſſity of declaring her the ſucceſſor. None but the more
zealous proteſtants adhered either to the counteſs of Hartford, or to her
younger ſiſter, Eleanor, who had eſpouſed the earl of Cumberland; and
as the marriage of the former ſeemed liable to ſome objections, and had
been declared invalid, men were alarmed, even on that ſide, with the
proſpect of new diſputes concerning the ſucceſſion. Mary's behaviour
alſo, ſo moderate towards the proteſtants, and ſo gracious towards all
men, had procured her univerſal reſpect<note n="‖" place="bottom">Melvin, p. 53, 61, 74.</note>; and the public was willing to
aſcribe any imprudences, into which ſhe had fallen, to her youth and
inexperience. But all theſe ſlattering proſpects were blaſted by the
ſubſequent incidents, where her egregious indiſcretions, ſhall I ſay,
or atrocious crimes, threw her from the height of her proſperity, and
involved her in infamy and ruin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="473" facs="tcp:0429000102:76"/> THE earl of Bothwel was of a
conſiderable family and power in Scotland; and tho' not diſtinguiſhed by
any talents either of a civil or military nature, he had made a figure in that
party, which oppoſed the greatneſs of the earl of Murray, and the more
rigid reformers. 
<note place="margin">Murder of Darnley.</note> He was a man of
profligate manners; had involved his opulent fortune in great debts, and even
reduced himſelf to beggary, by his profuſe expences<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p. 240.</note>; and ſeemed to have no reſource but in
deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate councils and enterprizes. He had been accuſed more than once of
an attempt to aſſaſſinate Murray; and notwithſtanding that the
frequency of theſe accuſations on all ſides diminiſh ſomewhat the
credit due to any particular impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they prove ſufficiently the
prevalence of that deteſtable practice in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and may in that view
ſerve to render ſuch rumours the more likely and credible. This man had of
late acquired the favour and entire confidence of Mary; and all her meaſures
were directed by his advice and authority. Reports were ſpread of more
particular intimacies and familiarities between them; and theſe reports
gained ground from the continuance or rather encreaſe of her hatred towards
her huſband<note n="†" place="bottom">Melvil, p. 66, 77.</note>. That
young prince was reduced to ſuch a ſtate of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, by the neglects
which he underwent from his Queen and the courtiers, that he had once
reſolved to fly ſecretly into France or Spain, and had even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
himſelf of a veſſel for that purpoſe<note n="‡" place="bottom">Keith, p. 345-348.</note>. Some of the moſt conſiderable
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, on the other hand, obſerving her fixed averſion to him, had
propoſed ſome expedients for a divorce; and tho' Mary is ſaid to have
ſpoke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably on that occaſion, and to have embraced the propoſal no
farther than it ſhould be found conſiſtent with her own honour and her
ſon's legitimacy<note n="‖" place="bottom">Camden, p. 404. Goodal's.
Queen Mary, vol II p. 317.</note>, men were inclined to believe, that the
difficulty of finding proper means for effectuating that purpoſe, was the
real cauſe of laying aſide all farther thoughts of it. So far were the
ſuſpicions againſt her carried, that, when Henry, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with the
continual proofs of her hatred, left the court and retired to Glaſgow, an
illneſs of an extraordinary nature, with which he was ſeized imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
on his arrival in that place, was univerſally aſcribed by her enemies to a
doſe of poiſon, which, it was pretended, ſhe had adminiſtred to
him.</p>
               <p>WHILE affairs were on this footing, all thoſe who wiſhed
well to her character or the repoſe of their country, were extremely
pleaſed, and ſomewhat ſurprized, to hear, that a friendſhip was again
conciliated between them, that ſhe had taken a journey to Glaſgow on
purpoſe to viſit him during his ſickneſs, that ſhe behaved towards
him with great tenderneſs, that ſhe had brought him along with her, and
that ſhe appeared thenceforth determined to live with him on a ſooting more
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:0429000102:77"/> ſuitable to the connexions between them. Henry,
naturally uxorious, and not miſtruſting this ſudden reconcilement, put
himſelf implicitly into her hands, and attended her to Edinburgh. She lived
in the palace of Holy-rood-houſe; but as the ſituation of that place was
low, and the concourſe of perſons about the court was neceſſarily
attended with noiſe, which might diſturb him in his preſent infirm
ſtate of health, theſe reaſons were aſſigned for fitting up an
apartment for him in a ſolitary houſe, at ſome diſtance, called the
Kirk of Field. Mary here gave him marks of kindneſs and attachment; ſhe
converſed cordially with him; and ſhe lay ſome nights in a room below
his; but on the ninth of February, ſhe told him, that ſhe would paſs that
night in the palace, becauſe the marriage of one of her ſervants was there
to be celebrated in her preſence. 
<note place="margin">10th Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</note> About two o'clock in
the morning the whole town was much alarmed at hearing a great noiſe; and
were ſtill more aſtoniſhed, when it was diſcovered, that the noiſe
came from the King's houſe, which was blown up by gun-powder; that his dead
body was found at ſome diſtance in a neighbouring field; and that no marks
either of fire, contuſion or violence appeared upon it<note n="*" place="bottom">It was imagined, that Henry had been ſtrangled before the
houſe was blown up: But this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is contradicted by the
confeſſion of the criminals; and there is no neceſſity to admit it in
order to account for the condition of his body. There are many inſtances that
men's lives have been ſaved who have been blown up in ſhips. Had Henry
fallen on water he had not probably been killed.</note>.</p>
               <p>NO doubt could be entertained but Henry was murdered; and the
general conjecture ſoon pointed towards the earl of Bothwel as the author of
that crime<note n="†" place="bottom">Melvil, p.

his favour with Mary was open and viſible, and his power great, no one
ventured to declare openly his ſentiments, and all men remained in ſilence
and mute aſtoniſhment. Voices, however, were heard in the ſtreets, during
the darkneſs of the night, proclaiming Bothwel, and even Mary herſelf, to
be the murderers of the King; placards were ſecretly affixed to the ſame
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; offers were made, that, upon giving proper ſecurities, his guilt
ſhould be openly proved: But after one proclamation from the court, offering
a reward and indemnity to any one that would diſcover the author of that
villainy, greater vigilance was employed in ſearching out the ſpreaders of
the libels and reports againſt Bothwel, and the Queen, than in tracing the
cauſes of the King's murder, or detecting the regicides<note n="‡" place="bottom">Anderſon's Collections, vol. II. p. 38. vol. IV. p. 167, 168.

               <p>THE earl of Lenox, who lived at a diſtance from the court, in
poverty and contempt, was rouzed by the report of his ſon's murder, and wrote
to the Queen, imploring ſpeedy juſtice againſt the aſſaſſins;
among whom he named the earl of <pb n="475" facs="tcp:0429000102:78"/> Bothwel, Sir James
Balfour and Gilbert Balfour his brother, David Chalmers, and four others of the
Queen's houſhold; all of them perſons, who had been mentioned in the
placards affixed on the walls at Edinburgh<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p.
372. Anderſon, vol. II. p. 3.</note>. Mary took his demand of ſpeedy
juſtice in a very literal ſenſe; and allowing only fifteen days for the
examination of this important affair, ſhe ſent a citation to Lenox,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him to appear in court, and prove his charge againſt Bothwel<note n="†" place="bottom">Keith, p. 373.</note>. This nobleman, meanwhile, and
all the other perſons, accuſed by Lenox, enjoyed their full liberty<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 374, 375.</note>; Bothwel himſelf was
continually ſurrounded with armed men<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p.
405.</note>; took his place in council<note n="§" place="bottom">Anderſon,
vol. I. p. 38, 40, 50, 52.</note>; lived during ſome time in the houſe with
Mary<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid. vol. II. p. 274.</note>; and
ſeemed to poſſeſs all his wonted confidence and familiarity with her.
Even the caſtle of Edinburgh, a place of great conſequence, in this
critical time, was entruſted to his creature, Sir James Balfour, who had
himſelf been publickly charged as an accomplice in the King's murder<note n="¶" place="bottom">Spotſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wood, p. 201.</note>. Lenox, who had come as
far as Stirling, with a view of appearing at the trial, was informed of all
theſe circumſtances; and reflecting on the ſmall train, which attended
him, he began to entertain very juſt apprehenſions from the power,
inſolence, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity of his enemy. He wrote to Mary, deſiring that the
day of trial might be prorogued; and conjured her, by all the regard which
ſhe bore to her own honour, to employ more leiſure and deliberation in
determining a queſtion of ſuch extreme moment<note n="**" place="bottom">Keith, p. 375. Anderſon, vol. I. p. 52.</note>. No regard was
paid to his application: The jury was encloſed, of which the earl of
Caithneſs was chancellor; and tho' Lenox, foreſeeing the precipitation, had
ordered Cunningham, one of his retinue, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in court, and proteſt, in
his name, againſt the acquital of the criminal, the jury proceeded to a
ſentence<note n="††" place="bottom">Keith, p. 376. Anderſon,
vol. II. p. 106 Spotſwood, p. 201.</note>. 
<note place="margin">12th April.</note> The ſentence was ſuch
as it behoved them to give, where neither accuſer nor witneſs appeared; and
Bothwel was abſolved from the King's murder. The jury, however,
apprehenſive that their ſentence would give great ſcandal, and perhaps
expoſe them afterwards to ſome danger, entered a proteſt, in which they
repreſented the neceſſity of their proceedings<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 201. Anderſon, vol. I. p. 113.</note>. It is
remarkable, that the indictment was laid againſt Bothwel for committing the
crime on the ninth of February, not the tenth, the real day on which Henry was
aſſaſſinated<note n="§§" place="bottom">Keith, p 375.
Anderſon, vol. II. p. 93. Spotſwood, p. 201.</note>. The interpretation
generally put upon this error, too groſs, it was thought, to have proceeded
from miſtake, was, that the ſecret council, by whom Mary was governed, not
truſting entirely to precipitation, violence, and <pb n="476" facs="tcp:0429000102:79"/>
authority, had provided this plea, by which they enſured, at all adventures,
a plauſible pretence for acquitting Bothwel.</p>
               <p>TWO days after this extraordinary tranſaction, a Parliament
was held; and tho' the ſentence in favour of Bothwel was attended with ſuch
circumſtances as ſtrongly confirmed, rather than diminiſhed, the general
opinion of his guilt, he was the perſon choſen to carry the royal ſcepter
on the firſt meeting of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſembly<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p. 78. Crawford, p. 14.</note>. In this Parliament, a
rigorous act was made againſt thoſe who ſet up defamatory placards; but
no notice was taken of the King's mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note n="†" place="bottom">Keith,
p. 380. The Queen, in order to gain the people, agreed to an act of Parliament,
which eſtabliſhed the proteſtant religion; a conceſſion which ſhe
could never before be brought to make.</note>. The favour, which Mary openly
bore to Bothwel, kept every one in awe; and the effects of this terror appeared
more plainly in another tranſaction, which enſued immediately upon the
diſſolution of the Parliament. A bond or aſſociation was framed; in
which the ſubſcribers, after relating the acquital of Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel by a legal

ſubſcription to this paper may juſtly be regarded as a reproach to the

               <p>THE ſubſequent meaſures of Bothwel were equally
precipitant and audacious. Mary having gone to Stirling to pay a viſit to her
ſon, he aſſembled a body of eight hundred horſe, under pretence of
purſuing ſome robbers on the borders, and having way-laid her on her
return, he ſeized her perſon near Edinburgh, and carried her to Dunbar,
with an avowed deſign of forcing her to yield to his purpoſe. 
<note place="margin">24th April.</note> Sir James Melvil, who was
in her retinue, was carried along with her; and ſays not, that he ſaw any
ſigns of reluctance or conſtraint: He was even informed, as he tells us, by
one of Bothwel's officers, that the whole tranſaction was managed in concert
with her<note n="*" place="bottom">Melvil, p. 80.</note>. A woman, indeed, of
that ſpirit and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which is acknowledged to belong to Mary, does
not uſually, on theſe occaſions, give ſuch marks of oppoſition to
real violence, as can appear any wiſe doubtful or ambiguous. Some of the
nobility, however, in order to put mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to farther trial, ſent her a
private meſſage; in which they told her, that, if in reality ſhe lay
under force, they would uſe all their efforts to relieve her. Her anſwer
was, that ſhe had indeed been carried to Dunbar by violence; but ſince her
arrival had been ſo well treated there, that ſhe willingly remained with
Bothwel<note n="†" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 202.</note>. No one gave
themſelves thenceforth any ſolicitude to relieve her from a captivity,
which they believed to have proceeded entirely from her own approbation and
connivance.</p>
               <p>THIS unuſual conduct was at firſt aſcribed to Mary's
ſenſe of the infamy, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her purpoſed marriage; and her deſire
of finding ſome colour to gloſs over the irregularity of her conduct. But a
pardon given to Bothwel a few days afterwards, made the public carry ſomewhat
farther their conjectures. In this deed, Bothwel received a remiſſion for
the violence committed on the Queen's perſon; and for <hi>all other
crimes:</hi> A clauſe, by which the murder of the King was indirectly
pardoned. The rape was then conjectured to be only a contrivance of theſe

               <p>THESE events paſſed with ſuch rapidity, that men had no
leiſure to admire ſufficiently one incident, when they were ſurprized
with a new one, equally rare and uncommon. There ſtill, however, remained one
difficulty, which, it was not eaſy to foreſee, how the Queen and Bothwel,
determined as they were to execute their ſhameful purpoſe, could find
expedients to overcome. The man, who had procured the ſubſcription of the
nobility, recommending him as a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <pb n="478" facs="tcp:0429000102:81"/> to the Queen,
and who had acted this ſeeming violence on her perſon, in order to force
her conſent, had been married ſix months before to another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; to a
woman of merit, of a very noble family, ſiſter to the earl of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. But
perſons blinded with paſſion, and infatuated with crimes, ſoon ſhake
off all appearance of decency. A ſuit was commenced for a divorce between
Bothwel and his wife; and this ſuit was opened at the ſame inſtant in two
differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or rather oppoſite courts; in the court of the archbiſhop of
St. Andrews, which was popiſh, and governed itſelf by the canon law; and in
the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorial or commiſſariot court, which was proteſtant,
and was regulated by the principles of the reformed teachers. The plea advanced
in each court, was ſo calculated as to ſuit the principles which there
prevailed: In the archbiſhop's court, the pretence of conſanguinity was
employed, becauſe Bothwel was related to his wife in the fourth degree; in
the commiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ariot court, the
accuſation of adultery was made uſe of againſt him. The parties too who
applied for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, were different in the different courts: Bothwel was
the perſon who ſued in the former; his wife in the latter. And the ſuit
in both courts was opened, pleaded, examined, and decided with the utmoſt
precipitation, and a ſentence of divorce was pronounced in four days<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. II. p. 280.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE divorce being thus obtained, it was thought proper that Mary
ſhould be conducted to Edinburgh, and ſhould there appear before the courts
of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſhould acknowlege herſelf to be reſtored to entire
freedom. This was underſtood to be contrived with a view of obviating all
doubts with regard to the validity of her marriage. Orders were then given to
publiſh the banns in the church, between the Queen and the duke of Orkney;
for that was the title which he now bore; and Craig, a miniſter of Edinburgh,
was applied to for that purpoſe. This clergyman, not content with having, for
ſome time, refuſed compliance, publicly in his ſermons condemned the
marriage; and exhorted all thoſe who had acceſs to the Queen, to give her
their advice againſt ſo ſcandalous an alliance. Being called before the
council, to anſwer for this liberty, he ſhowed a courage which might cover
the whole nobles with ſhame, on account of their tameneſs and ſervility.
He ſaid, that, by the rules of the church, the earl of Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, being
convicted of adultery, could not be permitted to marry; that the divorce
between him and his former wife, was plainly procured by colluſion, as
appeared by the precipitation of that ſentence, and the ſudden concluſion
of his marriage with the Queen; and that all the ſuſpicions which
prevailed, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the King's murder, and the Queen's concurrence in
the former rape, <pb n="479" facs="tcp:0429000102:82"/> would thence receive undoubted
confirmation. He therefore exhorted Bothwel, who was preſent, no longer to
perſevere in his preſent criminal enterprizes; and turning his
diſcourſe to the other counſellors, he charged them to employ all their
influence with the Queen, in diverting her from a meaſure which would cover
her with infamy and diſhonour. Not ſatisfied even with this admonition, he
took the firſt opportunity of informing the public, from the pulpit, of this
whole tranſaction, and expreſſed to them his fears, that,
notwithſtanding all remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, their ſovereign was ſtill
obſtinately bent on her fatal purpoſe. 
<q rend="inline">"For himſelf," he ſaid, "he had already
diſcharged his conſcience, and yet again would take heaven and earth to
witneſs, that he abhorred and deteſted that marriage, as ſcandalous and
hateful in the ſight of mankind: But ſince the Great, as he perceived,
either by their flattery or ſilence, gave countenance to the meaſure, he
beſought the Faithful to pray fervently to the Almighty, that a reſolution,
which was taken contrary to all law, reaſon, and good conſcience, might, by
the divine bleſſing, be turned to the comfort and benefit of the church and
kingdom."</q> Theſe ſpeeches offended the court extremely; and Craig was
anew ſummoned before the council, to anſwer for his temerity in thus
paſſing the bounds of his commiſſion. But he told them, that the bounds
of his commiſſion were the word of God, good laws, and natural reaſon;
and were the Queen's marriage tried by any of theſe three ſtandards, it
would appear infamous and diſhonourable, and would be ſo eſteemed by the
whole world. The council were ſo overawed by this heroic behaviour in a
private clergyman, that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him without farther cenſure or
puniſhment<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 203. Anderſon, vol. II.
p. 280.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' this tranſaction might have recalled Bothwel and the
Queen of Scots, from their infatuation, and might have inſtructed them in the
diſpoſitions of the people, as well as their own inability to oppoſe
them; they were ſtill reſolute to ruſh forward to their own manifeſt
deſtruction.

               <p>THE news of theſe tranſactions, being carried to foreign

pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment the authors of ſuch atrocious crimes. This intelligence, with a
little more leiſure for reflection, rouſed men at laſt from their
lethargy; and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which from the very beginning<note n="†" place="bottom">Crawford, p. 11. Keith, Pref. p. 9.</note>, had been ſpread
againſt Mary, as if ſhe had concurred in the King's murder, ſeemed now,
by the ſubſequent tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, to have received a ſtrong confirmation
and authority. It was every where ſaid, that, even tho' no particular and
direct proofs had as yet been produced of the Queen's guilt, the whole tenor of
her late conduct was ſufficient, not only to beget ſuſpicion, but to
produce entire conviction againſt her: That her ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den reſolution of
being reconciled to her huſband, whom before ſhe had long and juſtly
hated; her bringing him to court, from which ſhe had baniſhed him by
neglects and rigours; her fitting up ſeparate apartments for him; were all of
them circumſtances, which, tho' trivial in themſelves, yet, being compared
with the following events, bore a very unfavourable aſpect for her: That the
leaſt which, after the King's murder, might have been expected in her
ſituation, was a more than uſual caution in her meaſures, and an extreme
anxiety to puniſh the real aſſaſſins, in order to free herſelf from
all reproach and ſuſpicion: That no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had any regard to her
character, would allow a man, publicly accuſed of her huſband's murder,
ſo much as to approach her preſence, far leſs give him a ſhare in her
councils, and endow him with favour and authority: That an acquital merely in
the abſence of accuſers, was very ill fitted to ſatisfy the public;
eſpecially if that abſence proceeded from a deſigned precipitation of the
ſentence, and from the terror which her known friendſhip for the criminal
had infuſed into every one: That the very mention of her marriage to ſuch a
perſon, in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, was horrible; and the contrivance of
extorting a conſent of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and of concerting a rape, were groſs
artifices, more proper to betray her guilt than prove her innocence: That where
a woman thus ſhews a conſciouſneſs of merited reproach, and, inſtead
of correcting, provides only thin gloſſes to <pb n="481" facs="tcp:0429000102:84"/> cover
her exceptionable conduct, ſhe betrays a neglect of fame, which muſt
ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be the effect or the cauſe of the moſt ſhameful enormities: That
to eſpouſe a man, who had a few days before been ſo ſcandalouſly
divorced from his wife; who, to ſay the leaſt, was believed to have, a few
months before, aſſaſſinated her huſband, was ſo contrary to the
plaineſt rules of behaviour, that no pretence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion or
imprudence could account for ſuch a conduct: That a woman, who, ſo ſoon
after her huſband's death, tho' not attended with any extraordinary
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, contracts a marriage which might, in itſelf, be the moſt
blameleſs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape ſevere cenſure; but one who overlooks, for
her pleaſure, ſo many other weighty conſiderations, was equally capable,
in gratifying her appetites, to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect every regard to honour, and to
humanity: That Mary was not ignorant of the prevailing opinion of the public,
with regard to her own guilt, and of the inferences which would every where be
drawn from her conduct; and therefore, if ſhe ſtill continued to purſue
meaſures which gave ſuch juſt offence, ſhe ratified, by her actions, as
much as by the moſt formal confeſſion, all the ſurmizes and imputations
of her enemies: That the only circumſtance which oppoſed all theſe
preſumptions, was, the benignity and goodneſs of her preceding behaviour,
which ſeemed to remove her from all ſuſpicion of ſuch atrocious
inhumanity; but that the characters of men were extremely variable, and the
perſons who were guilty of the worſt actions, were not always naturally of
the worſt and moſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal diſpoſitions: That a woman, who, in a
critical and dangerous moment, had ſacrificed her honour to a man of
abandoned principles, might thenceforth be led blindfold by him to the
commiſſion of the moſt enormous crimes, and was in reality no longer at
her own diſpoſal: And that tho' one ſuppoſition was ſtill left to
alleviate her blame, viz. that Bothwel, preſuming on her affection towards
him, had of himſelf committed the crime, and had never communicated it to
her, yet ſuch a ſudden and paſſionate love to a man whom ſhe had long
known, could not eaſily be accounted for, without ſuppoſing ſome degree
of preceding guilt; and as it appeared that ſhe was not afterwards
reſtrained, either by ſhame or prudence, from incurring the higheſt
reproach and danger, it was not likely, that a ſenſe of duty or humanity
would have a more powerful influence over her.</p>
               <p>THESE were the general ſentiments which prevailed throughout
Scotland; and as the proteſtant teachers, who had great authority, had long
borne a great ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity towards Mary, the opinion of her guilt was, by that
means, the more widely diffuſed, and made the deeper impreſſion on every
one. Some attempts made by Bothwel, and, as it is pretended, with her
conſent, to get the young prince into his power, excited the moſt ſerious
attention; and the principal nobility, even many of thoſe who had formerly
been conſtrained to ſign the application in <pb n="482" facs="tcp:0429000102:85"/> favour of
Bothwel's marriage, met at Stirling, and formed an aſſociation for
protecting the prince, and puniſhing the King's murderers<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p. 394.</note>. The earl of Athole himſelf, a known
catholic, was the firſt author of this confederacy: The earls of Argyle,
Morton, Mar, Glencarne, the lords Boyd, Lindeſey, Hume, Semple, Kirkaldy of
Grange, Tullibardine, and ſecretary Lidington, entered zealouſly into it.

ſubſiſted during ſome time by pyracy. He was purſued thither by

rigour againſt her; and they ſent her next day under a guard to the
caſtle of Lochlevin, ſituated in a lake of that name. The miſtreſs of
the houſe was mother to the earl of Murray; and as ſhe pretended to have
been lawfully married to the late King of Scots, ſhe naturally bore an
animoſity to Mary, and treated her with the utmoſt harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and
ſeverity.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH, who was exactly informed of all thoſe events,
ſeemed touched with compaſſion towards the unfortunate Queen; and as all
her fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were now laid aſleep, by the conſideration of
that ruin and infamy in which Mary's conduct had involved her, ſhe began to
reflect on the inſtability of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs, the precarious ſtate of royal
grandeur, the danger of encouraging rebellious ſubjects; and ſhe reſolved
to employ her authority for alleviating the calamities of her unhappy
ſiſter. She ſent Sir Nicholas Throcmorton ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to Scotland, in
order to remonſtrate both with Mary and the aſſociated lords; and ſhe
gave him inſtructions which, tho' mixt with ſome lofty preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, were
full of that good ſenſe which was ſo natural to her, and of that
genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which the preſent intereſting ſituation had called forth.
She empowered him to declare in her name to Mary, that the late conduct of that
princeſs, ſo enormous, and in every reſpect ſo unjuſtifiable, had
given her the higheſt offence; and tho' ſhe felt the movements of pity
towards her, ſhe had once determined never to interpoſe in her affairs,
either by advice or aſſiſtance, but to abandon her entirely, as a
perſon whoſe condition was totally deſperate, and honour irretrieveable:
That ſhe was well aſſured, that other foreign princes, Mary's near
relations, had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the ſame reſolution; but, for her part, the late
events had touched her heart with more tender ſympathy, and had made her
adopt meaſures more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the liberty and intereſts of the unhappy
Queen: That ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to ſee her oppreſſed by her
rebellious ſubjects, but would employ all her good offices, and even her
power, to redeem her from captivity, and place her in ſuch a condition as
would at once be compatible with her dignity, and the <pb n="484" facs="tcp:0429000102:87"/>
ſafety of her ſubjects: That ſhe entreated her to lay aſide all
thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, except againſt the murderers of her huſband; and as
ſhe herſelf was his near relation, ſhe was better entitled than the
ſubjects of Mary to interpoſe her authority on that head, and ſhe
therefore beſought that princeſs, if ſhe had any regard to her own honour
and ſafety, not to oppoſe ſo juſt and reaſonable a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: That
after thoſe two points were provided for, her own liberty, and the
puniſhment of her huſband's aſſaſſins, the ſafety of her infant
ſon was next to be conſidered; and there ſeemed no expedient more proper
for that purpoſe, than the ſending him to be educated in England: And that
beſides the ſecurity which would attend his removal from all factions and
convulſions, there were many other beneficial conſequences, which it was
eaſy to foreſee as the reſult of his education in that country<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p. 411, 412, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE remonſtrances which Throcmorton was inſtructed to make
to the aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated lords, were entirely conformable to theſe ſentiments
which Elizabeth enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Mary's favour. She empowered him to tell them,
that whatever blame ſhe might throw on Mary's conduct, any oppoſition to
their ſovereign was totally unjuſtifiable, and incompatible with all order
and good government: That it belonged not to them to reform, much leſs to
puniſh, the mal-adminiſtration of their prince; and the only arms which
ſubjects could in any caſe lawfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy againſt the ſupreme
authority, were entreaties, councils, and repreſentations: That if theſe
expedients failed, they were next to appeal by their prayers to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and to
wait with patience till the Almighty, in whoſe hands are the hearts of
princes, ſhould be pleaſed to turn them to juſtice and to mercy: That
ſhe inculcated not this doctrine becauſe ſhe herſelf was intereſted
in its obſervance; but becauſe it was univerſally received in all well
governed ſtates, and was eſſential to the preſervation of civil
ſociety: That ſhe required them to reſtore their Queen to liberty; and
promiſed, in that caſe, to concur with them in all proper expedients for
regulating the government, for puniſhing the King's mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and for
guarding the life and liberty of the infant prince: And that if the ſervices
which ſhe had lately conferred on the Scotiſh nation, in protecting them
from foreign uſurpation, were duly conſidered by them, they would repoſe
confidence in her good offices, and would eſteem themſelves blame-worthy,
in never having as yet made any application to her<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 414, 415, 42<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Throcmorton ſome articles of accommodation, which he was to propoſe to both
parties, as expedients for the ſettlement of public affairs; and tho' theſe
articles included ſome conſiderable <pb n="485" facs="tcp:0429000102:88"/> reſtraints on
the ſovereign power, they were in the main calculated for Mary's advantage,
and were ſufficiently indulgent to her<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p.
416.</note>. The aſſociated lords, who were determined to proceed with
greater ſeverity, were apprehenſive of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth's partiality; and being
ſenſible, that Mary would take courage from the protection of that powerful
princeſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 427.</note>, they thought
proper, after ſeveral affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed delays, to refuſe the Engliſh
ambaſſador all acceſs to her perſon. There were four different
ſchemes propoſed in Scotland, for the treatment of the captive Queen: One,
that ſhe ſhould be reſtored to her authority under very ſtrict
limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: The ſecond, that ſhe ſhould be obliged to reſign her
crown to the prince, be baniſhed the kingdom, and be confined either to
France or England; with aſſurance from the ſovereign in whoſe dominions
ſhe ſhould reſide, that ſhe ſhould make no attempts to the
diſturbance of the eſtabliſhed government: The third, that ſhe ſhould
be publicly tried for her crimes, of which her enemies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have
undoubted proof and be condemned to perpetual impriſonment: The fourth was
ſtill more ſevere, and required, that, after her condemnation, capital
puniſhment ſhould be inflicted upon her<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 420.</note>. Throcmorton ſupported the mildeſt
propoſal; but tho' he promiſed his miſtreſs's guarantee for the
perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of articles, threatned them with immediate vengeance in caſe of
refuſal<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THERE were ſeveral pretenders to the regency of the young
prince, after the intended depoſition of Mary. The earl of Lenox claimed that
authority as grandfather to the prince: The duke of Chatelrault, who was
abſent in France, had pretenſions as next heir to the crown: But the
greateſt number of the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated lords inclined to the earl of Murray,
in whoſe capacity they had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt truſt, and who poſſeſſed
the entire confidence of the preachers and more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reformers. All
meaſures being therefore concerted, three inſtruments were ſent to Mary,
by the hands of lord Lindeſey and Sir Robert Melvil; by one of which ſhe
was to reſign the crown in ſavour of her ſon, by another to appoint
Murray regent, by the third to name a Council, which ſhould adminiſter the
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <pb n="486" facs="tcp:0429000102:89"/> till his arrival in Scotland. The Queen of
Scots, ſeeing no proſpect of relief, lying juſtly under apprehenſions
of her life, and believing, that no deed, which ſhe executed during her
captivity, could be valid, was prevailed on, after a plentiful effuſion of
tears, to ſign theſe three inſtruments; and ſhe took not the trouble of
inſpecting any one of them<note n="*" place="bottom">Melvil, p. 85.
Spotſwood, p. 211. Anderſon, vol. III. p. 19.</note>. In conſequence of
this forced reſignation, the young prince was proclaimed King, under the name
of James the ſixth. 
<note place="margin">29th July.</note> He was ſoon after crowned
at Stirling, and the earl of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton took in his name the oath of Coronation;
in which a promiſe to extirpate hereſy was not forgot. Some republican
pretenſions in favour of the people's power were countenanced in this
ceremony<note n="†" place="bottom">Keith, p. 439, 44<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the famous ſaying of Trajan was inſcribed, <hi>Pro me; ſi merear, in

Scots<note n="‖" place="bottom">Keith, p. 430.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE council of regency had not long occaſion to exerciſe
their authority. The earl of Murray arrived from France, and took
poſſeſſion of his high office. He paid a viſit to the captive Queen;
and ſpoke to her in a manner which better ſuited her paſt conduct than
her preſent condition. This harſh treatment quite extinquiſhed in her
breaſt any remains of affection towards him<note n="§" place="bottom">Melvil, p. 87. Keith, p. 445.</note>. Murray pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded afterwards
to break, in a more public manner, all terms of decency with her. 
<note place="margin">15th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</note> He ſummoned a
Parliament; and that aſſembly, after voting that ſhe was undoubtedly an
accomplice in her huſband's murder, condemned her to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
ratified her dimiſſion of the crown, and acknowleged her ſon for King,
and Murray for regent<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. II. p.
206, &amp; ſeq.</note>. The regent, who was a man of vigour and abilities,
employed himſelf ſucceſsfully in reducing the kingdom. He bribed Sir
James Balfour to ſurrender the caſtle of Edinburgh: He conſtrained the
gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Dunbar to open their gates: And he demoliſhed that
fortreſs.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' every thing thus bore a favourable aſpect to the new
government, and all men ſeemed to ſubmit to Murray's authority; a violent
revolution, however neceſſary, can never be effected without great
diſcontents; and it was not likely, that in a country, where the government,
in its moſt ſettled ſtate, poſſeſſed a very disjointed authority,
a new eſtabliſhment ſhould meet with no interruption or diſturbance.
Few conſiderable men of the nation ſeemed willing to ſupport Mary, ſo
long as Bothwel was preſent; but the removal of that obnoxious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman had
altered the ſentiments of many. The duke of Chatelrault, being diſappointed
of the regency, bore no good will to Murray and his counſellors; 
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:0429000102:90"/> and the ſame ſentiments were embraced by all his
numerous retainers: Several of the nobility, finding that others had taken the
lead among the aſſociators, formed a faction apart, and oppoſed the
prevailing power: And beſides ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of duty and affection towards
Mary, the malecontent lords, finding every thing carried to extremity againſt
her, were naturally led to embrace her cauſe, and ſhelter themſelves
under her authority. All thoſe who retained any propenſity to the catholic
religion were inclined to join this party; and even the people in general, tho'
they had formerly either deteſted Mary's crimes, or blamed her imprudence,
were now moved by her misfortunes to compaſſionate her preſent
ſituation, and lamented, that a perſon, poſſeſſed of ſo many
amiable accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, joined to ſuch high dignity, ſhould be treated
with ſuch extreme rigour and ſeverity<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Buchan. lib. xviii. c. 53.</note>, Animated by all theſe
motives, many of the principal nobility, now adherents to the Queen of Scots,
met at Hamilton, and concerted meaſures for ſupporting the cauſe of that
princeſs.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1568</label> WHILE theſe humours were in
agitation, Mary was employed in contrivances for effecting her eſcape; and
ſhe engaged, by her charms and careſſes, a young gentleman, George
Douglas, brother to the laird of Lochlevin, to aſſiſt her in that
enterprize. She even went ſo far as to give him hopes of eſpouſing her,
after her marriage with Bothwel ſhould be diſſolved on the plea of force;
and ſhe propoſed this expedient to the regent, who rejected it. Douglas,
however, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered in his endeavours to free her from captivity; and having
all opportunities of acceſs to the houſe, he was at laſt ſucceſsful
in the undertaking. 
<note place="margin">2d May.</note> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed her in
diſguiſe into a ſmall boat, and himſelf rowed her aſhore. She
haſtened to Hamilton; and the news of her arrival in that place being
immediately ſpread abroad, many of the nobility flocked to her with their
forces. A bond of aſſociation for her defence was ſigned by the earls of
Argyle, Huntley, Egling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Crawford, Caſſiles, Rothes, Montroſe,
Southerland, Errol, nine biſhops, and nine barons, beſides many of the
moſt conſiderable gentry<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p. 475.</note>. And
in a few days an army, to the number of ſix thouſand men, was aſſembled
under her ſtandard.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH was no ſooner informed of Mary's eſcape, than
ſhe diſcovered her reſolution of perſevering in the ſame generous and
friendly meaſures, which ſhe had hitherto purſued. If ſhe had not
employed force againſt the regent, during the impriſonment of that
princeſs, ſhe had been chiefly with-held by the fear of puſhing him to
greater extremities againſt her<note n="†" place="bottom">Keith, p. 463.

had propoſed to the <pb n="488" facs="tcp:0429000102:91"/> court of France an expedient,
which, tho' leſs violent, would have been no leſs effectual for her
ſervice: She deſired that France and England ſhould by concert cut off
all commerce with the Scotch, till they ſhould do juſtice to their injured
ſovereign<note n="‡" place="bottom">Keith, p. 462.</note>. She now
diſpatched Leighton into Scotland to offer both her good offices, and the
aſſiſtance of her force to Mary; but as ſhe was apprehenſive of the
entrance of French troops into the kingdom, ſhe deſired that the
controverſy between the Queen of Scots and her ſubjects might by that
princeſs be referred entirely to her arbitration, and that no foreign
ſuccours ſhould be introduced into Scotland<note n="‖" place="bottom">Keith, p. 473. in the notes. Anderſon, vol. IV. p.
26.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT Elizabeth had not leizure to exert fully her efforts in
favour of Mary. The regent made haſte to aſſemble forces; and
notwithſtanding that his army was inferior in number to that of the Queen of
Scots, he took the field againſt her. 
<note place="margin">13th May.</note> A battle was fought at
Langſide near Glaſgow, which was entirely deciſive in favour of the
aſſociated lords; and tho' the regent, after his victory, ſtopt the
bloodſhed, yet was the action followed by a total diſperſion of the
Queen's party. That unhappy princeſs fled ſouthwards from the field of
battle with great precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and came, with a few attendants, to the
borders of England. 
<note place="margin">Mary flies into England.</note> She here
delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated concerning her next meaſures, which would probably prove ſo
important to her future happineſs or miſery. She found it impoſſible to
remain in her own kingdom: She had an averſion, in her preſent wretched
condition, to return into France, where ſhe had formerly appeared with ſo
much ſplendour; and was not, beſides, provided of a veſſel, which could
ſafely convey her thither: The late generous behaviour of Elizabeth made her
hope for defence, and even aſſiſtance, from that quarter<note n="*" place="bottom">Jebb's Collection, vol. I. p. 420.</note>; and as the
preſent fears of her domeſtic enemies were the moſt urgent, ſhe
overlooked all other conſiderations, and embraced the reſolution of taking
ſhelter in England. 
<note place="margin">16th May.</note> She embarked on board a
fiſhing-boat in Galloway, and landed the ſame day at Wirkington in
Cumberland, about thirty miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from Carliſle; whence ſhe
immediately diſpatched a meſſenger to London; notifying her arrival,
deſiring liberty to viſit Elizabeth, and craving her protection, in
conſequence of former profeſſions of friendſhip, made her by that
princeſs.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH now found herſelf in a ſituation, when it was
become neceſſary to take ſome deciſive reſolution with regard to her
treatment of the Queen of Scots; and as ſhe had hitherto, contrary to the
opinion of Cecil, attended more to the motives of generoſity than of
policy<note n="†" place="bottom">Cabala, p. 140.</note>, ſhe was engaged
by that prudent miniſter to weigh anew all the conſiderations, which
occurred in this critical conjuncture. <pb n="489" facs="tcp:0429000102:92"/> He repreſented,
that the party, which had dethroned Mary, and had at preſent aſſumed the
government of Scotland, were always the partizans of the Engliſh alliance,
and were engaged, by all the motives of religion and of intereſt, to
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in their connexions with Elizabeth: That tho' Murray and his
friends might complain of ſome unkind uſage during their baniſhment in
England, they would eaſily forget theſe grounds of quarrel, when they
conſidered, that Elizabeth was the only ally, on whom they could ſafely
depend, and that their own Queen, by her attachment to the catholic faith, and
by her other connexions, excluded them entirely from the friendſhip of
France, and even from that of Spain: That Mary, on the other hand, even before
her violent breach with her proteſtant ſubjects, was in ſecret entirely
governed by the counſels of the houſe of Guiſe; much more, would ſhe
implicitly comply with their views, when by her own miſconduct the power of
that family and of the zealous catholics was become her ſole reſource and
ſecurity: That her pretenſions to the Engliſh crown would render her a
very dangerous inſtrument in their hands; and were ſhe once able to
ſuppreſs the proteſtants in her own kingdom, ſhe would unite the Scotch
and Engliſh catholics, with thoſe of all foreign ſtates, in one
confederacy againſt the religion and government of England: That it behoved
Elizabeth therefore to proceed with caution in the deſign of reſtoring her
rival to the throne; and to take care, both that that enterprize, if
undertaken, ſhould be effected by Engliſh forces alone, and that full
ſecurities ſhould beforehand be provided for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers and the
reformation in Scotland: That above all, it was requiſite to guard carefully
the perſon of that princeſs; leſt, finding this unexpected reſerve in
the Engliſh friendſhip, ſhe ſhould ſuddenly take the reſolution of
flying into France, and ſhould attempt by foreign force to recover
poſſeſſion of her authority: That her deſperate fortunes and broken
reputation fitted her for any attempt; and her reſentment, when ſhe
ſhould find herſelf thus deſerted by the Queen, would concur with her
ambition and her bigotry, and render her an unrelenting, as well as powerful,
enemy to the Engliſh government: That if ſhe was once abroad, in the hands
of enterprizing catholics, the attack of England would appear to her as eaſy
as that of Scotland; and the only method, ſhe muſt imagine, of recovering
her native kingdom, would be to acquire that crown, to which ſhe would
eſteem herſelf equally intitled: That a neutrality in ſuch intereſting
ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tho' it might be pretended, could never, without the moſt
extreme danger, be upheld by the Queen; and the detention of Mary was equally
requiſite, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the power of England were to be employed in her favour,
or againſt her: That nothing indeed was more becoming a great prince than
generoſity; yet the ſuggeſtions of this noble principle could never,
without the utmoſt imprudence, be <pb n="490" facs="tcp:0429000102:93"/> conſulted in ſuch
delicate circumſtances as thoſe in which the Queen was at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
placed; where her own ſafety and the intereſts of her people were
intimately concerned in every reſolution which ſhe embraced: That tho' the
example of ſucceſsful rebellion, eſpecially in a neighbouring country,
could be no wiſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any ſovereign, yet Mary's imprudence had
been ſo great, perhaps her crimes ſo enormous, that the inſurrection of
ſubjects, after ſuch provocation, could no longer be regarded as a
precedent againſt other princes: That it was firſt neceſſary for
Elizabeth to aſcertain, in a regular and ſatisfactory manner, the extent of
Mary's guilt, and thence to determine the degree of protection which ſhe
ought to afford her, againſt her diſcontented ſubjects: That as no glory
could ſurpaſs that of defending oppreſſed innocence, it was equally
infamous to patronize vice and murder on the throne; and the contagion of
ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour would extend itſelf to all who countenanced or
ſupported it: And that if the crimes of the Scotch princeſs ſhould, on
enquiry, appear as great and certain as was affirmed and believed, every
meaſure againſt her, which policy ſhould dictate, would thence be
juſtified; or if ſhe ſhould be found innocent, every enterprize, which
friendſhip ſhould inſpire, would be acknowledged laudable and
glorious.</p>
               <p>AGREEABLE to theſe views, Elizabeth reſolved to proceed in a
ſeemingly friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but really cautious manner, with the Queen of Scots; and
ſhe immediately ſent orders to lady Scrope, ſiſter to the duke of
Norfolk, a lady who lived in the neighbourhood, to attend on that princeſs.
Soon after ſhe diſpatched to her the lord Scrope himſelf, warden of the
marches, and Sir Francis Knolles, vice cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain. They found Mary already
lodged in the caſtle of Carliſle; and after expreſſing the Queen's
ſympathy with her in her late misfortunes, they told her, that her requeſt
of being allowed to viſit their ſovereign, and of being admitted to her
preſence, could not at preſent be complied with: Till ſhe had cleared
herſelf of her huſband's murder, of which ſhe was ſo ſtrongly
accuſed, Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth could not without diſhonour ſhow her any countenance,
or appear indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the aſſaſſination of ſo near a
kinſman<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. p. 54, 66, 82, 83,
86.</note>. So unexpected a check threw Mary into tears; and the neceſſity
of her ſituation extorted from her a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhe would willingly
juſtify herſelf to her ſiſter from all imputations, and would ſubmit
her cauſe to the arbitration of ſo good a friend<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 10, 55, 87.</note>. Two days after, ſhe ſent lord
Herreis to London with a letter to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>THIS conceſſion, which Mary could ſcarce avoid, without an
acknowlegement of guilt, was the point expected and deſired by Elizabeth: She
immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched <pb n="491" facs="tcp:0429000102:94"/> Midlemore to the regent of
Scotland; requiring him both to deſiſt from the farther proſecution of
his Queen's party, and to ſend ſome perſons to London to juſtify his
conduct with regard to her. Murray might juſtly be ſtartled at receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a
meſſage, which muſt have appeared ſomewhat imperious; but as his
domeſtic enemies were numerous and powerful, and England was the ſole ally,
which he could expect among foreign nations, he was reſolved rather to
digeſt the affront than provoke Elizabeth by a refuſal. He alſo
conſidered, that tho' that Queen had hitherto appeared partial to Mary, her
intereſt evidently engaged her to ſupport the King's cauſe in Scotland;
and it was not to be doubted but that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating princeſs would in the end
diſcover this advantage, and would at leaſt afford him a patient and
equitable hearing. He therefore replied, that he would himſelf take a journey
into England, attended with other commiſſioners, and would willingly
ſubmit the determination of his cauſe to Elizabeth<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>—16.</note>.</p>
               <p>LORD Herreis now perceived, that his miſtreſs had advanced
too far in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions: He endeavoured to maintain, that Mary could
not, without diminution of her royal dignity, ſubmit to a conteſt with her
rebellious ſubjects before a foreign prince; and he required either preſent
aid from England, or liberty for his Queen to paſs over into France. Being
preſſed, however, with the former agreement before the Engliſh council,
he again renewed his conſent; but in a few days he began anew to recoil, and
it was with ſome difficulty that he was brought to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the
firſt determination<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p.
16-20.</note>. Theſe fluctuations, which were inceſſantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
ſhowed his viſible reluctance to the meaſures purſued by the court of
England.</p>
               <p>THE Queen of Scots diſcovered no leſs averſion to the
trial propoſed; and it required all the artifice and prudence of Elizabeth to
make her perſevere in the agreement to which ſhe had at firſt
conſented. This latter princeſs ſtill ſaid to her, that ſhe deſired
not, without Mary's conſent and approbation, to enter into this queſtion,
and pretended only as a friend to hear her juſtification: That ſhe was
confident there would be found no difficulty in refuting all the calumnies of
her enemies; and even if her apology ſhould fall ſhort of full conviction,
Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth was determined to ſupport her cauſe, and procure her ſome
reaſonable terms of accommodation: And that it was never meant, that ſhe
ſhould be cited to a trial with her rebellious ſubjects, but on the
contrary, that they ſhould be ſummoned to appear and juſtify themſelves
for their conduct towards her<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 11,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>
                  </note>. Allured by theſe
plauſible profeſſions, the Queen of Scots agreed to juſtify herſelf
by her own commiſſioners before commiſſioners which ſhould be
appointed by Elizabeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:0429000102:95"/> DURING theſe tranſactions, the lord
Scrope and Sir Francis Knolles, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided with Mary at Carliſle, had
leizure to ſtudy her character, and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it to Elizabeth.
Unbroken by her misfortunes, reſolute in her purpoſe, active in her
enterprizes, ſhe aſpired to nothing but victory, and was determined to
endure any extremity, to undergo any difficulty, and to try every fortune,
rather than abandon her cauſe, or yield the ſuperiority to her enemies.
Eloquent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating, affable; ſhe had already convinced all thoſe, who
approached her, of the innocence of her paſt conduct; and as ſhe declared
her fixed purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire aid of her friends all over Europe, and even to
have recourſe to infidels and barbarians, rather than fail of vengeance
againſt her perſecutors, it was eaſy to foreſee the danger to which her
charms, her ſpirit, her addreſs, if allowed to operate with their full
force, would expoſe them<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. p.

court of England, therefore, who under pretence of guarding her, had already,
in effect, detained her cloſe priſoner, were determined to watch her with
ſtill greater vigilance. As Carliſle, by its ſituation on the borders,
afforded her great opportunities for contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eſcape, they removed her
to Bolton, a ſeat of lord Scrope's in Yorkſhire: And the iſſue of the
controverſy between her and the Scotch nation was regarded as a ſubject
more momentous to Elizabeth's ſecurity and intereſts, than it had ever
hitherto been apprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Conferences at York and Hampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.</note>
THE perſons, appointed by the Engliſh court for the examination of this
great cauſe, were the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Suſſex, and Sir Ralph

<note place="margin">4th October.</note> Leſley, biſhop of
Roſs, the lords Herreis, Levingſtone and Boyde, with five perſons more,
appeared as commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners from the Queen of Scots. The earl of Murray,
regent, the earl of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the biſhop of Orkney, lord Lindeſey, and the
abbot of Dunfermling were appointed commiſſioners from the King and kingdom
of Scotland. Secretary Ledington, George Buchanan, the famous poet and
hiſtorian, with ſome others, were named as their aſſiſtants.</p>
               <p>IT was a great circumſtance of Elizabeth's glory, that ſhe
was thus choſen umpire between the factions of a neighbouring kingdom, which
had, during many centuries, entertained the moſt violent jealouſy and
animoſity againſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and her felicity was equally rare, in having
the fortune and fame of ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a rival, who had long given her the
greateſt inquietude, now entirely at her diſpoſal. Some circumſtances
of her late conduct had diſcovered a byaſs towards the ſide of Mary: Her
prevailing intereſts led her to favour the enemies of that princeſs: The
profeſſions of impartiality, which ſhe had made, were open and 
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:0429000102:96"/> frequent; and ſhe had ſo far ſucceeded, that each
ſide accuſed her commiſſioners of partiality towards their
adverſaries<note n="†" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p.

fixed no plan for the deciſion; but ſhe knew, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which
ſhe ſhould reap, muſt be great, whatever iſſue the cauſe ſhould
take. If Mary's crimes could be aſcertained by undoubted proof, ſhe could
for ever blaſt the reputation of that princeſs, and might juſtifiably
detain her for ever a cloſe priſoner in England: If the evidence fell
ſhort of conviction, it was propoſed to reſtore her to her throne, but
with ſuch ſtrict limitations, as would leave Elizabeth perpetual arbiter of
all differences between the parties in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and render her in effect

               <p>MARY'S commiſſioners, before they gave in their complaints

commiſſioners received this proteſt, but with a reſerve to the claim of
England. The complaint of that princeſs was next read, and contained a detail
of all the injuries, which ſhe had ſuffered, ſince her marriage with
Bothwel: That her ſubjects had taken arms againſt her, under pretence of
freeing her from captivity; that when ſhe put herſelf into their hands,
they had committed her to cloſe cuſtody in Lochlevin; had crowned her
ſon, an infant, in her place; had again taken arms againſt her after her
delivery from priſon; had rejected all her propoſals for accommodation; had
given battle to her troops; and had obliged her, for the ſafety of her

acquired ſuch influence over her as to gain her conſent to marry him, and
he had accordingly procured a divorce from his former wife, and had pretended
to celebrate his marriage with the Queen; that the ſcandal of this
tranſaction, the diſhonour which it brought on the whole nation, the danger
to which the infant prince was expoſed from the attempts of that audacious
man, had obliged the nobility to take arms, and oppoſe his criminal deſigns
and enterprizes; that after the Queen, in order to ſave him, had thrown
herſelf into their hands, ſhe ſtill diſcovered ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
attachment to him, that they found it neceſſary, for their own and the
public ſafety, to confine her perſon, during a ſeaſon, till Bothwel and
the other mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers <pb n="494" facs="tcp:0429000102:97"/> of her huſband could be tried and
puniſhed for their crimes; and that during this confinement, ſhe had
voluntarily, without compulſion or violence, merely from diſguſt at the
inquietudes and vexations attending power, reſigned her crown to her only
ſon, and had appointed the earl of Murray regent during the minority<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p. 64 &amp; ſeq. Goodall,
vol. II. p. 144.</note>. The Queen's anſwer to this apology was obvious: That
ſhe did not know and never could ſuſpect, that Bothwel, who had been
acquitted by a jury, and recommended to her by all the nobility for her
huſband, was the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of the King; that ſhe ever was, and ſtill
continues deſirous, that, if he be guilty, he may be brought to condign
puniſhment; that her reſignation of the crown was extorted from her by the
well-grounded fears of her life, and even by the direct menaces of violence;
and that Throcmorton, the Engliſh ambaſſador, as well as others of her
friends, had adviſed her to ſign that paper as the only means of ſaving
herſelf from the laſt extremity, and had aſſured her, that a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, given under theſe circumſtances, could never have any force or
validity<note n="†" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p. 60
&amp; ſeq. Goodall, vol. II. p. 162.</note>.</p>
               <p>SO far the Queen of Scots ſeemed plainly to have the advantage
in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; and the Engliſh commiſſioners might have been
ſurprized, that Murray had made ſo weak a defence, and had ſuppreſſed
all the material imputations againſt that princeſs, on which his party had
ever ſo ſtrenuouſly inſiſted, had not ſome private conferences
previouſly informed them of the ſecret. Mary's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners had
boaſted, that Elizabeth, from regard to her kinſwoman, and from her
deſire of maintaining the rights of ſovereigns, was determined, however
criminal the conduct of that princeſs might appear, to reſtore her to the
throne<note n="‡" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p. 45.
Goodall, vol. II. p. 127.</note>; and Murray, reflecting on ſome paſt
meaſures of the Engliſh court, began to apprehend that there was but too
juſt grounds for their expectations. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that Mary, if he would
agree to conceal the moſt violent part of the accuſation againſt her,
would ſubmit to any reaſonable terms of accommodation; but if he once
proceeded ſo far as to charge her with the whole of her ſuppoſed guilt,
no compoſition could afterwards take place; and ſhould ſhe ever be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, either by the power of Elizabeth, or the aſſiſtance of her
other friends, he and his party muſt be expoſed to her moſt ſevere and
implacable vengeance<note n="‖" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part
2. p. 47, 48. Goodall, vol. II. p. 159.</note>. He reſolved therefore not to
venture raſhly on a meaſure, which it would be impoſſible for him ever
to recal; and he paid privately a viſit to Norfolk and the other Engliſh
commiſſioners, confeſſed his ſcruples, laid before them the
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Queen's guilt, and deſired to have ſome ſecurity for
Elizabeth's <pb n="495" facs="tcp:0429000102:98"/> protection, in caſe theſe evidences
ſhould, upon examination, appear entirely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory. Norfolk was not
ſecretly diſpleaſed with theſe ſcruples of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Crawford, p. 92. Melvil, p 94, 95. Haynes, p
574.</note>. He had ever been a partizan of the Queen of Scots: Secretary
Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, who began alſo to incline to that party, and was a man of
ſingular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and capacity, had engaged him to embrace farther views in
her favour, and even to think of eſpouſing her: And tho' that duke
confeſſed<note n="‡" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p.
77.</note>, that the proofs againſt Mary ſeemed to him unqueſtionable, he
encouraged Murray in his preſent reſolution not to produce them publicly in
the conferences before the Engliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 57, 77. State Trials, vol I. p. 76.</note>.</p>
               <p>NORFOLK, however, was obliged to tranſmit to court the queries
propoſed by the regent. Theſe queries conſiſted of four particulars:
Whether the Engliſh commiſſioners had authority from their ſovereign to
pronounce any ſentence againſt Mary, in caſe her guilt ſhould be fully
proved before them? Whether they would promiſe to exerciſe that authority,
and proceed to an actual ſentence? Whether the Queen of Scots, if ſhe was
found guilty, ſhould be delivered into the hands of the regent, or, at
leaſt, ſo ſecured in England, that ſhe never ſhould be able to
diſturb the tranquillity of Scotland? and, Whether Elizabeth would alſo, in
that caſe, promiſe to acknowlege the young King, and protect the regent in
his authority<note n="‖" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p.
55. Goodall, vol. II. p. 130.</note>?</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH, when theſe queries, with the other tranſactions,
were laid before her, began to think that they pointed towards a concluſion
more deciſive and more advantageous than ſhe had hitherto expected. She was
determined, therefore, to bring the matter into full light; and under pretext
that the diſtance from her perſon retarded the proceedings of her
commiſſioners, ſhe ordered them to come to London, and there continue the
conferences. On their appearance, ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately joined in commiſſion
with them, ſome of the moſt conſiderable of her council; Sir Nicholas
Bacon lord keeper, the earls of Arundel and Leiceſter, lord Clinton, admiral,
and Sir William Cecil, ſecretary<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV.
part 2. p. 99.</note>. The Queen of Scots, who knew nothing of theſe ſecret
motives, and who expected, that fear or decency would ſtill reſtrain Murray
from proceeding to any violent accuſation againſt her, expreſſed an
entire ſatisfaction in this adjournment, and declared, that the affair, being
under the immediate inſpection of Elizabeth, was now in the hands where ſhe
moſt deſired it<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 95. Goodall, vol.
II. p. 177, 179.</note>. The conferences were accordingly continued at
Hampton-Court; and Mary's commiſſioners, as before, made no ſcruple to be
preſent at them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:0429000102:99"/> THE Queen, meanwhile, gave a
ſatisfactory anſwer to all Murray's demands; and having declared, that tho'
ſhe wiſhed and hoped, from the preſent enquiry, to be entirely convinced
of Mary's innocence, yet if the event ſhould prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and if that
princeſs ſhould appear guilty of her huſband's murder, ſhe ſhould,
for her part, eſteem her ever after unworthy of a throne<note n="‡" place="bottom">Goodall, vol. II. p. 199.</note>. The regent, encouraged by this
declaration, opened more fully his charge againſt the Queen of Scots; and
after expreſſing his reluctance to proceed to that extremity, and
proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that nothing but the neceſſity of ſelf-defence, which
muſt not be abandoned for any delicacy, could have engaged him in ſuch a
meaſure, he proceeded to accuſe her in plain terms, of participation and
conſent in the aſſaſſination of the King<note n="‖" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p. 115, &amp; ſeq. Goodall, vol.
II. p. 206.</note>. The earl of Lenox too appeared before the Engliſh
commiſſioners; and imploring vengeance for the murder of his ſon,
accuſed Mary as an accomplice with Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel in that enormity<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p. 122. Goodall, vol.
II. p. 208.</note>.</p>
               <p>WHEN this charge was ſo unexpectedly given in, and copies of
it tranſmitted to the biſhop of Roſs, lord Herreis, and the reſt of
Mary's commiſſioners, they abſolutely refuſed to return any anſwer;
and they grounded their ſilence on very extraordinary reaſons: They had
orders, they ſaid, from their miſtreſs, if any thing was advanced that
might touch her honour, not to make any defence, as ſhe was a ſovereign
princeſs, and could not be ſubject to any tribunal; and they required, that
ſhe ſhould previouſly be admitted to Elizabeth's preſence, to whom, and
to whom alone, ſhe was determined to juſtify her innocence<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p. 125, &amp; ſeq. Goodall,
vol. II. 184, 211, 217.</note>. They forgot, that the conferences were at
firſt begun, and were ſtill continued, with no other view than to clear her
from the accuſations of her enemies; that Elizabeth had ever pretended to
enter into them only as her friend, by her own conſent and approbation, not
as aſſuming any ſuperior juriſdiction over her; that that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
had from the beginning refuſed to admit her to her preſence, till ſhe
ſhould clear herſelf of the crimes imputed to her; that ſhe had therefore
diſcovered no new ſigns of partiality by her perſeverance in that
reſolution; and that tho' ſhe had granted an audience to the earl of Murray
and his collegues, ſhe had previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conferred the ſame honour on
Mary's commiſſioners<note n="†" place="bottom">Leſley's Negociations
in Anderſon, vol. III. p. 25. Haynes, p. 487.</note>; and her conduct was
ſo far entirely equal to both parties.</p>
               <p>AS the Queen of Scots refuſed to give in any anſwer to
Murray's charge, the neceſſary conſequence ſeemed to be, that there
could be no farther proceedings in the trial. But tho' this ſilence might be
interpreted as a preſumption againſt <pb n="497" facs="tcp:0429000102:100"/> her, it did not
fully anſwer the purpoſe of thoſe Engliſh miniſters, who were the
enemies of that princeſs. They ſtill deſired to have in their hands the
proofs of her guilt; and in order to draw them with decency from the regent, a
judicious artifice was employed by Elizabeth. Murray was called before the
Engliſh commiſſioners; and reproved by them, in the Queen's name, for the
atrocious imputations which he had had the temerity to throw upon his
ſovereign: But tho' the earl of Murray, they added, and the other
commiſſioners, had ſo far forgot the duty of allegiance to their prince,
the Queen never would overlook what ſhe owed to her friend, her neighbour,
and her kinſwoman; and ſhe therefore deſired to know what they could
ſay in their own juſtification<note n="†" place="bottom">Anderſon,
vol. IV. part 2. p. 147. Goodall, vol. II. p. 233.</note>. Murray, thus urged,
made no difficulty of producing the proofs of his charge againſt the Queen of
Scots; and among the reſt, ſome love-letters and ſonnets of her's to
Bothwel, wrote all in her own hand, and two other papers, one wrote in her own
hand, another ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her, and wrote by the earl of Huntley; each of which
contained a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of marriage with Bothwel.</p>
               <p>ALL theſe important papers had been kept by Bothwel in a
ſilver box or caſket, which had been given him by Mary, and which had
belonged to her firſt huſband, Francis; and tho' the princeſs had
enjoined him to burn the letters as ſoon as he had read them, he had thought
proper to preſerve them carefully, as pledges of her fidelity, and had
committed them to the cuſtody of Sir James Balfour, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the caſtle
of Edinburgh. When that fortreſs was beſieged by the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated lords,
Bothwel ſent a ſervant to receive the caſket from the hands of the
governor. Balfour delivered it to the meſſenger; but as he had at that time
received ſome diſguſt from Bothwel, and was ſecretly negociating an
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the ruling party, he took care, by conveying private
intelligence to the earl of Morton, to make the papers be intercepted by him.
They contained inconteſtible proofs of Mary's criminal correſpondence with
Bothwel, of her conſent to the King's murder, and of her concurrence in that
rape which Bothwel pretended to commit upon her<note n="‡" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol II. p. 115. Goodall, vol. II. p. 1.</note>. Murray
fortified this evidence by ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of correſpondent facts<note n="‖" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. II. part 2. p. 165, &amp;c. Goodall,
vol. II. p. 213.</note>; and he added, ſometime after, the dying
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of one Hubert, or French Paris, as he was called, a ſervant
of Bothwel's, who had been executed for the King's murder, and who directly
charged the Queen with her being acceſſary to that criminal enterprize<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. II. p. 192. Goodall, vol. II. p.
76.</note>.</p>
               <p>MARY'S commiſſioners had uſed every expedient to ward this
blow, which they ſaw coming upon them, and againſt which, it appears, they
were not provided <pb n="498" facs="tcp:0429000102:101"/> in any proper defence. As ſoon as
Murray opened his charge, they endeavoured to turn the conferences from an
enquiry into a negociation; and tho' informed by the Engliſh
commiſſioners, that nothing could be more diſhonourable for their
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, than to enter into a treaty with ſuch undutiful ſubjects,
before ſhe had juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified herſelf from thoſe enormous imputations which
had been thrown upon her, they ſtill inſiſted, that Elizabeth ſhould
ſettle terms of accommodation between Mary and her enemies in Scotland<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. II. part 2. p. 135, 139. Goodall, vol. II. p.
224.</note>. They maintained, that till their miſtreſs had given in her
anſwer to Murray's charge, his proofs could neither be called for nor
produced<note n="†" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p. 139,
145. Goodall, vol. II. p. 228.</note>; and finding, that the Engliſh
commiſſioners were ſtill determined to proceed in the method which had
been projected, they finally broke off the conferences, and never would make
any reply. Theſe papers have all of them been ſince publiſhed. The
objections made to their validity, are in general of ſmall force: But were
they ever ſo ſpecious, they cannot now be hearkened to; ſince Mary, at
the time when the truth could have been fully cleared, did, in effect, ratify
the evidence againſt her, by recoiling from the enquiry at the very critical
moment, and refuſing to give any anſwer to the accuſation of her
ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<note n="‡" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>We ſhall not enter into a long diſcuſſion of the
authenticity of theſe letters: We ſhall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark in general, that the
chief objections againſt them are, that they are ſuppoſed to have
paſſed thro' the earl of Morton's hands, the leaſt ſcrupulous of all
Mary's enemies; and that they are, to the laſt degree, indecent, and even
ſomewhat inelegant, ſuch as it is not likely ſhe would write. But to
theſe preſumptions we may oppoſe the following conſiderations. (1) The'
it be not difficult to counterfeit a ſubſcription, it is very difficult,
and almoſt impoſſible, to counterfeit ſeveral pages, ſo as to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble exactly the hand writing of any perſon. (2.) The letters are very
long, much longer than they needed to have been, in order to ſerve the
purpoſes of Mary's enemies; a circumſtance, which increaſed the
difficulty, and expoſed any forgery the more to the riſk of a detection.
(3.) They are not ſo groſs and palpable, as forgeries commonly are; for
they left ſtill a pretext for Mary's friends to aſſert, that their
meaning was ſtrained to make them appear criminal; ſee Goodall, vol. II. p.
361. (4.) There is a long contract of marriage, ſaid to be wrote by the earl
of Huntley, and ſigned by the Queen, before Bothwel's acquital. Would Morton,
without any neceſſity, have thus doubled the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of the forgery,
and the danger of detection? (5.) The letters are indiſcreet; but ſuch was
apparently Mary's conduct at that time: They are inelegant; but they have a
careleſs, natural air, like letters haſtily wrote between familiar friends.
(6.) They contain ſuch a variety of particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as no body
could have thought of inventing, eſpecially as they muſt neceſſarily
have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her many means of detection. (7.) We ſee, that in writing
the firſt and longeſt letter, which ſhe penned late at night, her paper
failed her, and ſhe takes down a memorandum of what ſhe intended to add
next morning; and it is accordingly added: A circumſtance very particular,
and not likely to occur to any perſon who would forge theſe letters. (8.)
We have not the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals of the letters, which were in French: We have only a
Scotch and Latin tranſlation from the original, and a French tranſlation
profeſſedly done from the Latin. Now it is remarkable, that the Scotch
tranſlation is full of Galliciſms, and is clearly a tranſlation from a
French original: Such as <hi>make fault, faire des fautes; make it ſeem that

to make me advertiſen ent, faire m'avertir; put order to it, mettre ordre a

between herſelf and the King one evening: But Murray produced before the
Engliſh commiſſioners, the teſtimony of one Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, a gentleman of
the earl of Lenox, who ſwore, that the King, on her departure from him, gave
him an account of the ſame converſation. (10.) There ſeems very little
reaſon why Murray and his aſſociates ſhould run the riſk of ſuch a
dangerous forgery, which muſt have rendered them infamous, if detected;
ſince their cauſe, from Mary's known conduct, even without theſe letters,
was ſufficiently good and juſtifiable. (11.) Murray expoſed theſe
letters to the examination of perſons qualified to judge of them; the Scotch
council, the Scotch Parliament, Queen Elizabeth and her council, who were
poſſeſſed of a great number of Mary's genuine letters. (12.) He gave
Mary herſelf an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of refuting and expoſing him, if ſhe had
choſen to lay hold of it. (13.) The letters tally ſo well with all the
other parts of her conduct during that tranſaction, that theſe proofs throw
the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt light on each other. (14.) The duke of Norfolk, who had
examined theſe papers, and who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſo much Queen Mary, that he
intended to marry her, and in the end loſt his life in her cauſe, yet
believed them authentic, and was fully convinced of her guilt. This appears not
only from his letters above mentioned, to Queen Elizabeth and her miniſters,
but by his ſecret acknowlegement to Baniſter, his moſt truſty
confident. See State Trials, vol. 1. p. 81. In the conferences between the
duke, ſecretary Lidington, and the biſhop of Roſs, all of them zealous
partizans of that princeſs, the ſame thing ſeems always to be taken for
granted. Ibid. p. 74, 75. See farther MS. in the Advocate's library. A. 3. 28.
p. 314. from Cott. lib. Calig. c. 9. (15.) I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the preſumption
drawn from Mary's refuſal to anſwer. The only excuſe for her ſilence,
is, that the ſuſpected Elizabeth to be a partial judge: It was not, indeed,
the intereſt of that princeſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit and juſtify her rival and
competitor; and we accordingly find that Lidington, from the ſecret
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the duke of Norfolk, informed Mary, by the biſhop of Roſs,
that the Queen of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land never meant to come to a deciſion; but only to get
into her hands the proofs of Mary's guilt, in order to blaſt her character:
See State Trials, vol. 1. p. 77. But this was a better reaſon for declining
the trial altogether than for breaking it off, on frivolous pretences, the very
moment the chief accuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was unexpectedly opened againſt her. Tho'
ſhe could not expect Elizabeth's final deciſion in her favour, it was of
importance to give a ſatisfactory anſwer, if ſhe had any, to the
accuſation of the Scotch commiſſioners. That anſwer could have been
diſperſt for the conviction of the public, of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations, and of
poſterity. And ſurely after the accuſation and proofs were in Queen
Elizabeth's hand, it could do no hurt to give in the anſwers. Mary's
information, that the Queen never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaded to come to a deciſion, could be
no obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>cle to her
juſtification. (16.) The very diſappearance of theſe letters, is a
preſumption of their authenticity. That event can be accounted for no way but
from the care of King James's friends, who were diſirous to deſtroy every
proof of his mother's crimes. The diſappearance of Morton's narrative, and of
Crawford's evidence, from the Cotton library, Calig. c. 1. muſt have
proceeded from a like cauſe. See MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3. 29. p.
88.</p> 
                     <p>I find an objection made to the authenticity of the letters,
drawn from the vote of the Scotch privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>council, which affirms the letters to
be wrote and ſubſcribed by Queen Mary's own hand; whereas the copies given
in to the Parliament a few days after, were only wrote, not ſubſcribed. See
Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, vol. II. p. 64, 67. But it is not conſidered, that this
circumſtance is of no manner of force: There were certainly letters, true or
falſe, laid before the council; and whether the letters were true or falſe,
this miſtake proceeds equally from the inaccuracy or blunder of the clerk.
The miſtake is eaſily accounted for: The letters were only wrote by her;
the ſecond contract with Bothwel was only ſubſcribed. A proper accurate
diſtinction was not made; and they are all ſaid to be wrote and
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. A late writer, Mr. Goodall, has endeavoured to prove, that
theſe letters claſh with chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and that the Queen was not in the
places mentioned in the letters, on the days there aſſigned: To confirm
this, he produces charters and other deeds ſigned by the Queen, where the
date and place do not agree with the letters. But it is well known, that the
date of charters, and ſuch like grants, is no proof of the real day in which
they were ſigned by the ſovereign. Papers of that kind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly paſs
through different offices: The date is affixed by the firſt office; and may
precede very long the day of the ſignature.</p> 
                     <p>The account given by Morton of the manner in which the
papers came into his hands, is very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. When he gave it to the Engliſh
commiſſioners, he had reaſon to think it would be canvaſſed with all
the ſeverity of able adverſaries, intereſted in the higheſt degree to
refute it. It is probable, that he could have confirmed it by many
circumſtances and teſtimonies; ſince they declined the conteſt.</p> 
                     <p>The like obſervation extends to Hubert's dying
confeſſion. It is in vain at preſent to ſeek improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities in it,
and to magnify the ſmalleſt difficulty into a contradiction. It was
certainly a regular ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial paper, given in regularly and judicially; and
ought to have been canvaſſed at the time, if the perſons whom it
concerned had been aſſured of their own innocence.</p> 
                     <p>The ſonnets are inelegant; inſomuch, that both Brantome
and Ronſard, who knew Queen Mary's ſtile, were aſſured, when they ſaw
them, that they could not be her compoſition. Jebb, vol. II. p. 478. But no
perſon is equal in his productions, eſpecially one whoſe ſtile is ſo
little formed as Mary's muſt be ſuppoſed to be. Not to mention, that
ſuch dangerous and criminal enterprizes leave little tranquillity of mind for
elegant, poetical compoſitions.</p> 
                     <p>In a word, Queen Mary might eaſily have conducted the
whole conſpiracy againſt her huſband, without opening her mind to any one
perſon except Bothwel, and without writing a ſcrap of paper about it; but
it was very difficult to have conducted it, ſo as that her conduct ſhould
not betray her to men of diſcernment. In the preſent caſe, her conduct
was ſo groſs as to betray her to every body; and fortune threw into her
enemies hands, papers by which they could convict her. The ſame inſatuation
and imprudence, which happily is the uſual attendant of great crimes, will
account for both. It is proper to obſerve, that there is not one
circumſtance of the foregoing narrative, contained in the hiſtory, that is
taken from Knox, Buchanan, or even Thuanus, or, indeed, from any ſuſpected
authority.</p>

enough for her own ſatisfaction, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that the moſt eminent
perſons of her court ſhould alſo be acquainted <pb n="500" facs="tcp:0429000102:103"/>
with theſe tranſactions, and ſhould be convinced of the equity of her
proceedings. She ordered her privy-council to aſſembled; and that ſhe
might render the matter more ſolemn and authentic, ſhe added to them the
earls of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Weſtmoreland, Shrewſbury, Worceſter,
Huntingdon, and Warwic. The <pb n="501" facs="tcp:0429000102:104"/> whole proceedings of the
Engliſh commiſſioners were read to them: The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences produced by
Murray were peruſed: A great number of letters, wrote by Mary to Elizabeth,
were laid before them, and the hand-writing compared with that of letters
delivered in by the regent: The refuſal of the Queen of Scots
commiſſioners to make any reply, was related: And on the whole Elizabeth
told them, that as ſhe had, at firſt, thought it improper, that Mary, after
ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crimes were imputed to her, ſhould be admitted to her
preſence, before ſhe had, in ſome meaſure, juſtified herſelf from
the charge; ſo now, that her guilt was confirmed by ſo many plauſible
evidences, and all anſwer denied, ſhe muſt, for her part, perſevere
more ſteadily in that reſolution<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol.
IV. part 2. p. 170, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 254.</note>. Elizabeth next
called in the Queen of Scots commiſſioners, and after obſerving, that
ſhe eſteemed it much more decent for their miſtreſs to continue the
conferences, than to require the liberty of juſtifying herſelf in perſon;
ſhe told them, that Mary might either ſend her reply by a perſon whom
ſhe truſted, or deliver it herſelf to ſome Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh noblemen, whom
Elizabeth ſhould appoint to wait upon her: But as to her reſolution of
making no reply at all, ſhe muſt regard it as the ſtrongeſt
confeſſion of guilt; nor could they ever be eſteemed her friends, who
adviſed her to that method of proceeding<note n="†" place="bottom">Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p. 179, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p.

which ſhe wrote to Mary herſelf<note n="‡" place="bottom">Anderſon,

               <p>THE Queen of Scots had no other ſubterſuge from theſe
preſſing inſtances than ſtill to demand a perſonal conference with
Elizabeth: A conceſſion which, ſhe was ſenſible, could never be
granted<note n="‖" place="bottom">Cabala, p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

knew, that that expedient could decide nothing, and becauſe it brought
matters to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which that princeſs wanted to avoid. In order to keep
herſelf better in countenance, Mary thought of another device. Even after all
the conferences were broke off, ſhe ordered her commiſſioners to accuſe
the earl of Murray and his aſſociates as the murderers of the Kind<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Goodall, vol. II. p. 280.</note>: But this
accuſation, coming ſo late, being extorted merely by a complaint to
Murray's, and being unſupported by any proof, could only be regarded as an
angry retaliation upon her enemy<note n="**" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>Unleſs we take this angry accuſation, advanced by Queen
Mary, to be an argument of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray's guilt, there remains not the leaſt
preſumption which ſhould lead us to ſuſpect him to have been any way an
accomplice in the King's murder. That Queen never pretended to give any proof
of the charge; and her commiſſioners affirmed at the time, that they
themſelves knew of none, tho' they were ready to maintain its truth by their
miſtreſs's orders, and would produce ſuch proof as ſhe ſhould ſend
them. It is remarkable, that, at that time, it was impoſſible for either
her or them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any proof; becauſe the conferences before the
Engliſh commiſſioners were previouſly broke off.</p> 
                     <p>It is true, the biſhop of Roſs, in an angry pamphlet,
wrote by him under a borrowed name, (where it is eaſy to ſay any thing)
affirms, that lord Herreis, a few days after the King's death, charged Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray
with the guilt, openly, to his face, at his own table. That nobleman, as
Leſly relates the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, affirmed, that Murray, riding in Fife with one of
his ſervants, the evening before the commiſſion of that crime, ſaid to
him among other talk, <hi>This night' ere morning the lord Darnley ſhall
loſe his life.</hi> See Anderſon, vol. I. 75. But this is only hearſay of
Leſly's, concerning a hearſay of Herreis's; and contains a very improbable
fact. Would Murray, without any uſe or neceſſity, communicate to a
ſervant, ſuch a dangerous and important ſecret, merely by way of
converſation? We may alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that lord Herreis himſelf was one
of Queen Mary's commiſſioners who accuſed Murray. Had he ever heard this
ſtory, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and
not have affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's
guilt. See Goodall, vol. II. p. 307.</p> 
                     <p>The earls of Huntley and Argyle accuſe Murray of this
crime; but the reaſon which they aſſign is moſt ridiculous. He had
given his conſent to Queen Mary's divorce from the King; therefore he was the
King's murderer. See Anderſon, vol. IV. part 2. p. 192. It is a ſure
argument, that theſe earls knew no better proof againſt Murray, otherwiſe
they would have produced it, and not have infilled on ſo abſurd a
preſumption. Was not this alſo the time for Huntley to deny his writing
Mary's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with Bothwel, if that paper had been a forgery?</p> 
                     <p>Murray could have no motive to commit that crime. The King,
indeed, bore him ſome ill-will; but the King himſelf was become ſo
deſpicable, both from his own ill-conduct and the Queen's aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him,
that he could neither do good nor harm to any body. To judge by the event, in
any caſe, is always abſurd; but more eſpecially in the preſent. The
King's murder, indeed, procured Murray the regency: But much more Queen Mary's
ill conduct and imprudence, which he could not poſſibly foreſee, and
which never would have happened, had ſhe been entirely innocent.</p>
                  </note>. 
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:0429000102:105"/> She alſo deſired to have copies of the papers given
in by the regent; but as ſhe ſtill perſiſted in her reſolution to
make no reply, this demand was finally refuſed her<note n="*" place="bottom">Goodall, vol. II. p. 2, 3, 310, 311. Haynes, vol. I. p.

               <p>As Mary had thus put an end to the conference, the regent
expreſſed great impatience to return into Scotland; and he complained, that
his enemies had taken advantage of his abſence, and had thrown the whole
government into confuſion. Elizabeth, therefore, diſmiſſed him; and
granted him the loan of five thouſand pounds, to bear the charges of his
journey<note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 677.</note>. During
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at York, the duke of Chatelrault arrived at London, in
paſſing from France; and as the Queen knew, that he was engaged in Mary's
party, and had very plauſible pretenſions to the regency of the King of
Scots; ſhe thought proper to detain him till after Murray's departure. But

ſhe ſtill declined acknowleging the young King, or treating with Murray as
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of Scotland.</p>
               <p>ORDERS were given for removing the Queen of Scots from Bolton, a
place ſurrounded with catholics, to Tutbury in the county of Stafford; where
ſhe was put under the cuſtody of the earl of Shrewſbury. Elizabeth
entertained hopes, that that princeſs, diſcouraged by her misfortunes, and
confounded by the late tranſactions, would be glad to ſecure a ſafe
retreat from all the tempeſts, with which ſhe had been agitated; and ſhe
promiſed to bury every thing in oblivion, provided Mary would agree, either
to reſign voluntarily her crown, or to aſſociate her ſon with her in
the government; and the adminiſtration to remain, during his minority, in the
hands of the earl of Murray<note n="*" place="bottom">Goodall, vol. II. p.
295.</note>. But that high-ſpirited princeſs refuſed all treaty upon
ſuch terms, and declared, that her laſt words ſhould be thoſe of a
Queen of Scotland. Beſides many other reaſons, ſhe ſaid, which fixed
her in that reſolution, ſhe knew, that, if, in the preſent emergence,
ſhe made ſuch conceſſions, her ſubmiſſion would be univerſally
deemed an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegement of guilt, and would ratify all the calumnies of her
enemies<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 301.</note>.</p>
               <p>MARY ſtill inſiſted upon the alternative of two demands;
either that Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth ſhould in aſſiſt her in recovering her
authority, or ſhould give her liberty to retire into France, and make trial
of the friendſhip of other princes: And as ſhe aſſerted, that ſhe had
come voluntarily into England, invited by many former profeſſions of amity,
ſhe thought that one of theſe requeſts could not, without the moſt
extreme injuſtice, be refuſed her. But Elizabeth, ſenſible of the
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which attended either of theſe propoſals, was ſecretly
reſolved to detain her ſtill a captive; and as her retreat into England had
been very little voluntary, her claim upon the Queen's generoſity appeared
much leſs urgent than ſhe was willing to pretend. Neceſſity, it was
thought, would to the prudent juſtify her detention: Her paſt miſconduct
would apologize for it to the equitable: And tho' it was foreſeen, that
compaſſion for her ſituation, joined to her intrigues and inſinuating
behaviour, would, while ſhe remained in England, excite the zeal of her
friends, eſpecially of the catholics; theſe inconveniencies were eſteemed
much leſs than thoſe which attended any other expedient. Elizabeth
truſted alſo to her own addreſs, for eluding all thoſe difficulties:
She propoſed to avoid breaking ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely with the Queen of Scots, to keep
her always in hopes of accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to negotiate perpetually with her, and
ſtill to throw the blame of not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any concluſion, either on
unforeſeen accidents, or on the obſtinacy and perverſeneſs of
others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:0429000102:107"/> WE come now to mention ſome Engliſh
affairs, which we left behind us, that we might not interrupt our narration of
the events in Scotland, which form ſo material a part of the preſent reign.
The term, fixed by the treaty of Cateau-Cambreſis for the reſtitution of
Calais expired in 1567; and Elizabeth, after making her demand at the gates of
that city, ſent Sir Thomas Smith to Paris; and that miniſter, in
conjunction with Sir Henry Norris, her ordinary ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, enforced her
pretenſions. Conferences were held on that head, without coming to any
concluſion. The chancellor De L'Hopital told the Engliſh am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
that tho' France by an article of the treaty was obliged to reſtore Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais
on the expiration of eight years, there was another article of the ſame
treaty, which now deprived Elizabeth of all right, that could accrue to her by
that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement: That it was agreed, if the Engliſh ſhould, during that
interval, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit hoſtilities upon France, they ſhould inſtantly forfeit
all claim to Calais; and the taking poſſeſſion of Havre and Dieppe,
with whatever pretences that meaſure might be covered, was a plain violation
of the peace between the nations: That tho' theſe places were not taken by
force, but put into Elizabeth's hands by the governors; theſe governors were
rebels; and a correſpondence with ſuch offenders was the moſt flagrant
injury, which could be committed to any ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign: That in the treaty, which
enſued upon the expulſion of the Engliſh from Normandy, the French
miniſters had abſolutely refuſed to make any mention of Calais, and had
thereby declared their intention to take advantage of the title which had
accrued to the crown of France: And that tho' a general clauſe had been
inſerted, implying a reſervation of all claims; this conceſſion could
not avail the Engliſh, who at that time poſſeſſed no juſt claim to
Calais, and had previouſly forfeited all pretenſions to that
fortreſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 587.</note>. The Queen was no
wiſe ſurprized at hearing theſe allegations; and as ſhe knew, that the
French court intended not from the firſt to make reſtitution, much leſs,
after they could defend their refuſal by ſuch plauſible reaſons, ſhe
thought it better for the preſent to ſubmit to the loſs, than to purſue
a doubtful title by a war both dangerous and expenſive, as well as
unſeaſonable<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 406.</note>.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH entered anew into negotiations for marrying the
archduke Charles; and ſhe ſeemed at preſent to have no great motive of
policy, which might induce her to make this fallacious offer: But as ſhe was
very rigorous in the terms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, and refuſed him all power and
title, and even the exerciſe of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in England, the treaty came to
nothing; and that prince, deſpairing of ſucceſs in his addreſſes,
married the daughter of Albert, duke of Bavaria<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 407, 408.</note>.</p>

European churches, which ſhook off the yoke of the papal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, no one
proceeded with ſo much reaſon and moderation as the church of England; an
advantage, which had been derived partly from the interpoſition of the civil
magiſtrate in this innovation, partly from the gradual and ſlow ſteps by
which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom. Rage and animoſity
againſt the catholic religion was as little indulged as could be ſuppoſed
in ſuch a revolution: The fabric of the ſecular hierarchy was maintained
entire: The antient liturgy was preſerved, ſo far as was thought
conſiſtent with the new principles: Many ceremonies, become venerable from
age and preceding uſe, were retained: The ſplendor of the catholic
worſhip, tho' removed, had at leaſt given place to order and decency: The
diſtinctive habits of the clergy, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ranks, were
continued: No innovation was admitted merely from ſpite and oppoſition to
the former uſage: And the new religion, by mitigating the genius of the
antient ſuperſtition, and rendering it more compatible with the peace and
intereſts of ſociety, had preſerved itſelf in that happy medium, which
wiſe men have always ſought, and which the people have ſo ſeldom been
able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' ſuch in general was the ſpirit of the reformation
in that country, many of the Engliſh reformers, being men of a more warm
complexion and more obſtinate temper, endeavoured to puſh matters to
extremity againſt the church of Rome, and indulged themſelves in the moſt
violent contrariety and antipathy to all former practices. Among theſe,
Hooper, who afterwards ſuffered for his religion with ſuch extraord nary
conſtancy, was chiefly diſtinguiſhed. This man was named, during the
reign of Edward, to the fee of Gloceſter, and had no <pb n="506" facs="tcp:0429000102:109"/>
ſcruple to accept of the epiſcopal office; but he refuſed to be
conſecrated in the epiſcopal habits, the cymarre and rochette, which had
formerly, he ſaid, been abuſed to ſuperſtition, and which were thereby
rendered unbecoming a true chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. Cranmer and Ridley were ſurprized at
this objection, which oppoſed the received practice, and even the
eſtabliſhed laws; and tho' young Edward, deſirous to promote a man ſo
celebrated for his eloquence, his zeal, and his morals, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined them to
diſpenſe with this ceremony, they ſtill continued reſolute to retain
it. Hooper then embraced the reſolution, rather to refuſe the biſhopric
than cloath himſelf in thoſe hated garments; but it was determined, that,
for the ſake of the example, he ſhould not eſcape ſo eaſily. He was
firſt confined to Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's houſe, and then thrown into priſon, till he
ſhould conſent to be a biſhop on the terms propoſed: He was plyed with
conferences, and reprimands, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Bucer and Peter Martyr and the
moſt celebrated foreign reformers were conſulted on this important
queſtion: And a compromiſe, with great difficulty, was at laſt made, that
Hooper ſhould not be obliged to wear commonly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious robes, but
ſhould agree to be conſecrated in them, and to uſe them during cathedral
ſervice<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. II. p. 152. Heylin, p.
90.</note>: A condeſcenſion not a little extraordinary in a man of ſo
inflexible a ſpirit as this reformer.</p>
               <p>THE ſame objection, which had ariſen with regard to the
epiſcopal habits, had been moved againſt the rayment of the inferior
clergy; and the ſurplice in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, with the tippet and corner cap, was
a great object of abhorrence to many of the popular zealots<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype, vol. I. p. 416.</note>. In vain was it urged, that
particular habits, as well as poſtures and ceremonies, being conſtantly
uſed by the clergy, and employed in religious ſervice, acquire a veneration
in the eyes of the people, appear ſacred to their apprehenſions, excite
their devotion, and contract a kind of myſterious virtue, which attaches the
affections of men to the national and eſtabliſhed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: That in order
to produce this effect an uniformity in theſe particulars is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
and even a perſeverance, as far as poſſible, in the former practice: And
that the nation would be happy, if, by retaining theſe inoffenſive
obſervances, they could engage the people to renounce willingly what was
hurtful or perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the antient ſuperſtition. Theſe arguments,
which had influence with wiſe men, were the very reaſons, which engaged the
violent proteſtants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the habits. They puſhed matters to a total
oppoſition with the church of Rome: Every compliance, they ſaid, was a
ſymbolizing with Antichriſt<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p.
416.</note>: And this ſpirit was carried ſo far by ſome reformers, that
in a national remonſtrance, which was afterwards made by the church of
Scotland againſt theſe habits, it was aſked, 
<q rend="inline">"What has Chriſt Jeſus to do with Belial?
What has darkneſs <pb n="507" facs="tcp:0429000102:110"/> to do with light? If ſurplices,
corner caps, and tippets have been badges of idolaters in the very act of their
idolatry; why ſhould the preacher of Chriſtian liberty, and the open
rebuker of all ſuperſtition partake with the dregs of the Romiſh beaſt?
Yea, who is there that ought not rather to be afraid of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his hand or
on his forehead the print and mark of that odious beaſt?<note n="*" place="bottom">Keith, p. 565. Knox, p. 402.</note>"</q> But this application was
rejected by the Engliſh church.</p>
               <p>THERE was only one inſtance, where the ſpirit of
contradiction to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts took place univerſally in England: The
altar was removed from the wall, was placed in the middle of the church, and
was thenceforth denominated the communion-table. The reaſon, why this
reformation met with ſuch general compliance, was, that the nobility and
gentry got thereby a pretence for making ſpoil of the plate, veſtures, and
rich ornaments, which belonged to the altars<note n="†" place="bottom">Heylin, preface, p. 3. Hiſt. p. 106.</note>.</p>
               <p>THESE diſputes, which had been ſtarted during the reign of
Edward, were carried abroad by the proteſtants, who fled from the
perſecutions of Mary; and as their zeal had received an encreaſe from the
furious cruelty of their enemies, they were generally inclined to carry their
oppoſition to the utmoſt extremity againſt the practices of the church of
Rome. Their communication with Calvin and the other reformers, who followed the
diſcipline and worſhip of Geneva, confirmed them farther in this
obſtinate reluctance; and tho' ſome of the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees, particularly thoſe
eſtabliſhed at Frankfort, ſtill adhered to King Edward's liturgy, the
prevailing ſpirit carried theſe confeſſors to ſeek a ſtill farther
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. On the acceſſion of Elizabeth, they returned to their native
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and being regarded with general veneration on account of their zeal
and paſt ſufferings, they ventured to inſiſt on the eſtabliſhment
of their projected mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; nor did they want countenance from many of the
conſiderable perſons in the Queen's council. But the Princeſs herſelf,
ſo far from being willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil religion of the few ornaments and
ceremonies, which remained in it, was of herſelf rather inclined to bring the
public worſhip ſtill nearer to the Romiſh ritual<note n="‡" place="bottom">

thanks for his pains and piety.</hi> Heylin, p. 124. She would have

uſually ſaid, that ſhe thought two or three preachers were ſufficient
for a whole county.</note>; and ſhe thought, that the reformation had already
gone too far in ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="508" facs="tcp:0429000102:111"/> off thoſe forms and
obſervances, which, without diſtracting men of more refined
apprehenſions, tend in a very innocent manner to allure, and amuſe, and
engage the vulgar. She took care to have a law for uniformity ſtrictly
enacted: She was empowered by the parliament to add any new ceremonies, which
ſhe thought proper: And tho' ſhe was ſparing in the exerciſe of this
prerogative, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued rigid in exacting an obſervance of the
eſtabliſhed laws, and in puniſhing all nonconformity. The zealots,
therefore, who harboured a ſecret antipathy to the epiſcopal order and to
the whole liturgy, were obliged, in a great meaſure, to conceal theſe
ſentiments, which would have been regarded as highly audacious and criminal;
and they confined their avowed objections to the ſurplice, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of children, the ſign of the croſs in baptiſm, the ring in marriage,
kneeling at the ſacrament, and bowing at the name of Jeſus. So fruitleſs
is it for ſovereigns to watch with a rigid care over orthodoxy, and employ
the ſword in religious controverſy, that the work, perpetually renewed, is
perpetually to begin; and a garb, a geſture, nay, a metaphyſical or
grammatical diſtinction, when rendered important by the diſputes of
theologians and the zeal of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, is ſufficient to deſtroy the
unity of the church and even the peace of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Theſe controverſies
had already excited ſuch ferment among the people, that in ſome places they
refuſed to frequent the churches where the habits and ceremonies were uſed,
would not ſalute the conforming clergy, and proceeded ſo far as to revile
them in the ſtreets, to ſpit in their faces, and to uſe them with all
manner of contumely<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype's Life of Whitgift,
p. 460.</note>. And while the ſovereign authority checked theſe
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the flame was confined, not extinguiſhed; and burning fiercer
from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, it burſt out in the ſucceeding reigns to the
deſtruction of the church and monarchy.</p>
               <p>ALL enthuſiaſts, indulging themſelves in rapturous
flights, extaſies, viſions, inſpirations, have a natural averſion to
epiſcopal authority, to ceremonies, rites, and forms, which they denominate
ſuperſtition, or beggarly elements, and which ſeem to reſtrain the
liberal effuſions of their zeal and devotion: But there was another ſet of
opinions adopted by theſe innovators, which rendered them in a peculiar
manner the object of Elizabeth's averſion. The ſame bold and daring
ſpirit, which accompanied them in their addreſſes to the divinity,
appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their political ſpeculations; and the principles of civil
liberty, which, during ſome reigns had been very little avowed in the nation,
and which were totally incompatible with the preſent exorbitant prerogative,
had been ſtrongly adopted by this new ſect. Scarce any ſovereign before
Elizabeth, and none after <pb n="509" facs="tcp:0429000102:112"/> her, carried higher, both in
ſpeculation and practice, the authority of the crown; and the puritans (ſo
theſe ſectaries were called, on account of their pretending to a greater
purity of worſhip and diſcipline) could not recommend themſelves worſe
to her favour, than by preaching up the doctrine of reſiſting or
reſtraining princes. From all theſe motives, the Queen neglected no
opportunity of depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe zealous innovators; and while they were
countenanced by ſome of her moſt favoured miniſters, Cecil, Leiceſter,
Knolles, Bedford, Walſingham, ſhe never was, to the end of her life,
reconciled to their principles and practices.</p>
               <p>WE have thought proper to inſert in this place an account of
the riſe and the genius of the puritans; becauſe Camden marks the preſent
year, as the period when they began to make themſelves moſt conſiderable
in England. We now return to our narration.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk's conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</note> THE
Duke of Norfolk was the only peer, who enjoyed the higheſt title of
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and as there were at preſent no princes of the blood, the
ſplendor of his family, the opulence of his fortune, and the extent of his
influence, had rendered him without compariſon the firſt ſubject in
England. The qualities of his mind correſponded to his high ſtation:
Beneficent, affable, generous, he had acquired the affections of the people;
prudent, moderate, obſequious, he poſſeſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jealouſy the
good graces of his ſovereign. His grandfather and father had long been
regarded as the leaders of the catholics; and this hereditary attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
joined to the alliances of blood, had procured him the friendſhip of the
moſt conſiderable men of that party: But as he had been educated among the
refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, was ſincerely devoted to their principles, and maintained that
ſtrict decorum and regularity of life, by which the proteſtants were at
that time diſtinguiſhed; he thereby enjoyed the rare felicity of being
popular even with the moſt oppoſite factions. The height of his
proſperity alone was the ſource of his misfortunes, and engaged him into
attempts, from which his virtue and prudence would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have for ever
kept him at a diſtance.</p>
               <p>NORFOLK was at this time a widower; and being of a ſuitable
age to eſpouſe the Queen of Scots, that marriage had appeared ſo natural,
that it had occurred to ſeveral of his friends and thoſe of that
princeſs: But the firſt perſon, who, after ſecretary Lidington, opened
the ſcheme to the duke is ſaid to be the earl of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, before his
departure for Scotland<note n="*" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 36, 37.</note>.
That nobleman ſet before Norfolk both the advantage of compoſing the
differences in Scotland by an alliance which would be ſo generally
acceptable, and the proſpect of reaping the ſucceſſion of England; and
in order to bind Norfolk's intereſt the faſter with Mary's, he propoſed
that the <pb n="510" facs="tcp:0429000102:113"/> duke's daughter ſhould eſpouſe the young
king of Scotland. The obtaining pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly Elizabeth's conſent, was
regarded both by Murray and Norfolk as a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance eſſential to the
ſucceſs of their project; and all circumſtances being adjuſted between
them, Murray took care, by the means of Sir Robert Melvil, to have the deſign
communicated to the Queen of Scots. That princeſs replied, that the
vexations, which ſhe had met with in her two laſt marriages, had made her
more inclined to lead a ſingle life; but ſhe was determined to ſacrifice
her own inclinations to the public welfare: And therefore, ſo ſoon as ſhe
ſhould be legally divorced from Bothwel, ſhe would be determined by the
opinion of her nobility and people in the choice of another huſband<note n="†" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 40, 41.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT is probable, that Murray was not ſincere in this
propoſal. He had two motives to engage him to diſſimulation. He knew the
danger, which he muſt run in his return thro' the North of England, from the
power of the Earls of Northumberland and Weſtmoreland, Mary's partizans in
that country; and he dreaded an inſurrection in Scotland from the duke of
Chatelrault; and the earls of Argyle and Huntley, whom ſhe had appointed her
lieutenants during her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. By theſe feigned appearances of
friendſhip, he both engaged Norfolk to write in his favour to the northern
noblemen<note n="‡" place="bottom">State Trials, p. 76, 78.</note>; and he
perſwaded the Queen of Scots to give her lieutenants permiſſion, and even
advice, to make a ceſſation of hoſtilities with the regent's party<note n="‖" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 41.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE duke of Norfolk, tho' he had agreed, that Elizabeth's
conſent ſhould be previouſly obtained, before the completion of his
marriage, had good reaſon to apprehend, that he never would prevail with her
voluntarily to make that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. He knew her perpetual and unrelenting
jealouſy againſt her heir and rival; he was acquainted with her former
reluctance to all propoſals of marriage with the Queen of Scots; he
foreſaw, that that princeſs's eſpouſing a perſon of his power, and
character, and intereſt, would give the greateſt umbrage; and as it would
then become neceſſary to re-inſtate Mary in poſſeſſion of her
throne on ſome tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable terms, and even endeavour to re-eſtabliſh her
character, he dreaded, that Elizabeth, whoſe politics had now taken a
different turn, would never agree to ſuch indulgent and generous conditions.
He therefore endeavoured previouſly to gain the conſent and approbation of
ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable nobility; and he was ſucceſsful with
the earls of Pembroke, Arundel, Derby, Bedford, Shrewſbury, Southampton,
Northumberland, Weſtmoreland, Suſſex<note n="§" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 55. Camden, p. 419. Spotſwood, p. 230.</note>. The
lord Lumley, and Sir Nicholas Throcmorton embraced cordially the propoſal:
Even the earl of Leiceſter, Elizabeth's declared favourite, who had forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained <pb n="511" facs="tcp:0429000102:114"/>
ſome views of eſpouſing Mary, willingly reſigned all his pretenſions,
and ſeemed to enter zealouſly into Norfolk's intereſts<note n="*" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 535.</note>. There were other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, beſides
affection to the duke, which produced this general combination of the
nobility.</p>
               <p>SIR William Cecil, ſecretary of ſtate, was the moſt
vigilant, active, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent miniſter ever known in England; and as he was
governed by no views but the intereſts of his ſovereign, which he
inflexibly purſued, his authority over her became every day more predominant.
Ever cool himſelf, and uninfluenced by prejudice or affection, he checked
thoſe ſallies of paſſion, and ſometimes of caprice, to which ſhe
was ſubject; and if he failed of perſwading her in the firſt movement,
his perſeverance, and remonſtrances, and arguments were ſure at laſt to
recommend themſelves to her ſound diſcernment. The more credit he gained
with his miſtreſs, the more was he expoſed to the envy of her other
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; and as he had been ſuppoſed to adopt the intereſts of the
houſe of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, whoſe claim ſeemed to carry with it no danger to the
preſent eſtabliſhment, his enemies, in oppoſition to him, were
naturally led to attach themſelves to the Queen of Scots. Elizabeth ſaw,
without uneaſineſs, this emulation among her courtiers, which ſerved to
augment her authority; and tho' ſhe ſupported Cecil, wherever matters came
to extremity, and diſſipated every conſpiracy againſt him, particularly
one laid about this time to have him thrown into the Tower under ſome
pretence or other<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 417.</note>, ſhe
never gave him ſuch unlimited confidence as might enable him entirely to
cruſh his adverſaries.</p>
               <p>NORFOLK, ſenſible of the difficulty, which he muſt meet
with in controling Cecil's councils, eſpecially where they concurred with the
inclinations, as well as intereſts of the Queen, durſt not open to her his
intentions of marrying the Queen of Scots; but proceeded ſtill in the ſame
courſe of encreaſing his intereſt in the kingdom, and engaging more of
the nobility to take part in his meaſures. A letter was wrote to Mary by
Leiceſter, and ſigned by ſeveral men of the firſt rank, recommending
Norfolk for her huſband, and ſtipulating conditions for the advantage of
both kingdoms: That ſhe ſhould give ſufficient ſurety to Elizabeth, and
the heirs of her body, for the free enjoyment of the crown of England; that a
perpetual league, offenſive and defenſive, be made between their realms and
ſubjects; that the proteſtant religion be eſtabliſhed by law in
Scotland; and that ſhe ſhould grant an amneſty to her rebels in that
kingdom<note n="‡" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 50. Camden, p. 420. Haynes,
p. 535, 539.</note>. When Mary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a favourable anſwer to this
application, Norfolk applied himſelf with new ardor to the execution of his
project; and beſides ſecuring the intereſts of many <pb n="512" facs="tcp:0429000102:115"/> of the conſiderable gentry and nobility who reſided at court, he
wrote letters to ſuch as lived at their country ſeats, and
poſſeſſed the greateſt authority in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral counties<note n="‖" place="bottom">Leſly, p. 62.</note>. The Kings of France and
Spain, who intereſted themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely in Mary's cauſe, were
ſecretly conſulted, and expreſſed their approbation of theſe
meaſures<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 63.</note>. And tho'
Elizabeth's conſent was always ſuppoſed as a previous condition to the
finiſhing this alliance, it was apparently Norfolk's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, when he
proceeded ſuch lengths without conſulting her, to render his party ſo
ſtrong, that it ſhould no longer be in her power to refuſe it<note n="*" place="bottom">State Trials, vol. I. p. 82.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT was impoſſible, that ſo extenſive a conſpiracy
could entirely eſcape the Queen's vigilance and that of Cecil. She dropt
ſeveral ſurmiſes to the duke, by which he might learn, that ſhe was
acquainted with his deſigns; and ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently warned him to beware on
what pillow he repoſed his head<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p.
420. Spotſwood, p. 231.</note>: But he never had the prudence or the courage
to open to her his full intentions. The firſt certain intelligence, which
ſhe received of this dangerous combination was from the earl of Murray<note n="‡" place="bottom">Leſly, p. 71. It appears by Haynes, p. 521, 525, that Queen
Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth had heard rumours of Norfolk's dealing with Murray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and charged
the latter to inform her of the whole truth, which he accordingly did. See
alſo the earl of Murray's letter produced on Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk's trial.</note>, who,
if ever he was ſincere in promoting Norfolk's marriage, which is much to be
ſuſpected, had at leaſt propoſed, for his own ſafety and that of his
party, that Elizabeth ſhould, in reality as well as in appearance, be entire
arbiter of the conditions, and ſhould not have her conſent extorted by any
confederacy of her own ſubjects. This information gave great alarm to the
court of England; and the more ſo, that thoſe intrigues were attended with
other circumſtances, of which, it is probable, Elizabeth was not wholly
igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>AMONG the nobility and gentry, that ſeemed to enter into
Norfolk's views, there were many, who were zealouſly attached to the catholic
religion, who had no other deſign than that of reſtoring Mary to her
liberty, and who would gladly, by a combination with foreign powers, or even at
the expence of a civil war, have placed her on the throne of England. The earls
of Northumberland and Weſtmoreland, who poſſeſſed great power in the
north, were leaders of this party; and the former nobleman made offer to the
Queen of Scots, by Leonard Dacres, brother to lord Dacres, that he would free
her from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and convey her to Scotland or any other place, to which
ſhe ſhould think proper to retire<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Leſly,
p. 76.</note>. Sir Thomas and Sir Edward Stanley, ſons to the earl of Derby,
Sir Thomas Gerard, Rolſtone, and other gentlemen, whoſe intereſt 
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:0429000102:116"/> lay in the neighbourhood of the place where Mary
reſided, concurred in the ſame views, and required, that, in order to
facilitate the execution of the ſcheme, a diverſion ſhould, in the mean
time, be made from the ſide of Flanders<note n="‡" place="bottom">Leſly, p. 98.</note>. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk diſcouraged, and even in
appearance ſuppreſſed, theſe conſpiracies; both becauſe his duty to
Elizabeth would not allow him to think of effecting his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by
rebellion, and becauſe he foreſaw, that, if the Queen of Scots came into
the poſſeſſion of theſe men, they would rather chooſe for her
huſband the King of Spain, or ſome foreign prince, who had power, as well
as inclination, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh the catholic religion<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 77.</note>.</p>
               <p>WHEN men of honour and good principles, like the duke of
Norfolk, engage in dangerous enterprizes, they are commonly ſo unfortunate as
to be criminal by halves; and while they ballance between the execution of
their deſigns and their remorſes, their fear of puniſhment and their hope
of pardon, they render themſelves an eaſy prey to their enemies. The duke,
in order to repreſs the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes, ſpread againſt him, ſpoke
contemptuouſly to Elizabeth of the Scotch alliance; affirmed that his
eſtate in England was more valuable than the revenue of a kingdom waſted by
civil wars and factions; and declared, that, when he amuſed himſelf in his
own tennis-court at Norwich amidſt his friends and vaſſals, he eſteemed
himſelf at leaſt a petty prince, and was fully contented with his
condition<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 420.</note>. Finding, that
he did not convince her by theſe aſſeverations, and that he was looked on
with a jealous eye by the courtiers, he retired to his country-ſeat without

ſome differences with the Queen, but in reality with a view of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him
at the head of the northern rebels. The ſummons, ſent to the two earls,
precipitated the riſing before they were fully prepared; and Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
remained in ſuſpence between oppoſite dangers, when he was informed, that
ſome of his enemies were on the way with a commiſſion to arreſt him. He

whom he found ſurrounded with his friends and vaſſals, and deliberating
with regard to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which he ſhould follow in the preſent
emergence. They determined to begin the inſurrection without delay; and the
great credit of theſe two noblemen, with that zeal for the catholic religion,
which ſtill prevailed in the neighbourhood, ſoon drew together multitudes
of the common people. They publiſhed a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto, in which they
maintained, that they intended to attempt nothing againſt the Queen, to whom
they vowed unſhaken allegiance; and that their ſole aim was to
re-eſtabliſh the religion of their anceſtors, to remove evil

their liberty and to the Queen's favour<note n="‖" place="bottom">Cabbala,

               <p>THE Queen was not negligent in her defence, and ſhe had

of her people, the beſt ſecurity of a ſovereign; inſomuch that even the

of Norfolk himſelf, tho' he had loſt her favour, and lay in confinement,
was not wanting, as far as his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation permitted, to promote the levies
among his friends and retainers. Suſſex, <pb n="515" facs="tcp:0429000102:118"/> attended
with the earls of Rutland, the lords Hunſdon, Evers, and Willoughby of Parham
marched againſt the rebels at the head of ſeven thouſand men, and found
them already advanced to the biſhopric of Durham, of which they had taken
poſſeſſion. They retired before him to Hexham; and hearing that the
earl of Warwic and lord Clinton were advancing upon them with a greater body,
they found no other expedient but to diſperſe themſelves without
ſtriking a blow. The common people retired to their houſes: The leaders
fled into Scotland. Northumberland was found ſkulking in that country, and
was confined by Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray to the caſtle of Lochlevin. Weſtmoreland received
ſhelter from the cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Kers and Scots, partizans of Mary; and

retreated to their own country; and Weſtmoreland made his eſcape into

that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to enjoy her liberty, and to ſeek relief in all the catholic
courts of Europe, it behoved the Queen to ſupport the meaſure which ſhe
had adopted, and to guard by every prudent expedient againſt the miſchiefs
to which it was expoſed. She ſtill flattered Mary with hopes of her
protection, maintained an ambiguous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct between that Queen and her enemies
in Scotland, negotiated perpetually concerning the terms of her reſtoration,
made conſtant profeſſions of friendſhip to her; and by theſe
artifices endeavoured both to prevent her from making any deſperate efforts
for her delivery, and to ſatisfy the French and Spaniſh ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
who never intermitted their ſollicitations, ſometimes accompanied with
menaces, in her favour. This deceit was received with the ſame deceit by the
Queen of Scots: Profeſſions of confidence were returned by profeſſions
equally inſincere: And while an appearance of friendſhip was maintained on
both ſides, the animoſity and jealouſy, which had long prevailed between
them, was every day becoming more inveterate and incurable. Theſe two
princeſſes, in addreſs, capacity, activity, and ſpirit, were nearly a
match for each other; but unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, Mary, beſides her preſent forlorn
condition, was always inferior in perſonal conduct and diſcretion, as well
as in power, to her illuſtrious rival.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH and Mary wrote at the ſame time letters to the
regent. The Queen of Scots deſired, that her marriage with Bothwel might be
examined, and a divorce legally pronounced between them. The Queen of England
gave Murray the choice of three conditions; that Mary ſhould be reſtored to
her dignity on certain terms; that ſhe ſhould be aſſociated with her
ſon, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration remain in the regent's hands, till the young
prince ſhould come to years of diſcretion; or that ſhe ſhould be
allowed to live at liberty as a private perſon in Scotland, and have an
honourable ſettlement made upon her<note n="*" place="bottom">MSS. in the

Murray ſummoned a convention, in order to deliberate on theſe propoſals
of the two Queens. No anſwer was made by them to Mary's letter, under
pretence that ſhe had there maintained the ſtyle of a ſovereign,
addreſſing herſelf to her ſubjects; but in reality, becauſe they
ſaw that her requeſt was calculated to prepare the way for a marriage with
Norfolk, or ſome powerful prince, who could ſupport her cauſe, and
reſtore her to the throne. They replied to Elizabeth, that the two former
conditions were ſo derogatory to the royal authority of their prince, that
they could not ſo much as deliberate concerning them: The third alone 
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:0429000102:120"/> could be the ſubject of treaty. It was evident, that
Elizabeth, in propoſing conditions ſo unequal in their importance, invited
the Scotch to a refuſal of thoſe which were moſt advantageous to Mary;
and as it was difficult, if not impoſſible, to adjuſt all the terms of
the third, ſo as to render it ſecure and eligible to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it was
concluded that ſhe was not ſincere in any of them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 230, 231. Leſly, p 71.</note>.</p>

into his hands<note n="‖" place="bottom">Camden, p 425. Leſly, p.

                  <note place="margin">Aſſaſſination of the earl of
Murray.</note> But all theſe projects vaniſhed by the ſudden death of the
regent, who was aſſaſſinated, in revenge of a private injury, by a
gentleman of the name of Hamilton. Murray was a perſon of conſiderable
vigour, ability, and conſtancy; but tho' he was not unſucceſsful, during
his regency, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the diſſentions in Scotland, his talents
ſhone out more eminently in the beginning than in the end of his life. His
manners were rough and auſtere; and he poſſeſſed not that perfect
integrity, which frequently accompanies, and can alone atone for, that
unamiable character.</p>
               <p>BY the death of the regent, Scotland relapſed into its former
anarchy. Mary's party aſſembled together, and made themſelves maſters
of Edinburgh. The caſtle, commanded by Kirkaldy of Grange, ſeemed to favour
her cauſe; and as many of the principal nobility had embraced that ſide, it
became probable, tho' the people were in general averſe to her, that her
authority might again acquire the aſcendant. To check its progreſs,
Elizabeth diſpatched Suſſex, with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to the North, under colour of
chaſtizing the ravages committed by the borderers. He entered Scotland, and
laid waſte the lands of the Kers and Scots, ſeized the caſtle of Hume,
and committed hoſtilities on all Mary's partizans, who, he ſaid, had
offended his miſtreſs, by harbouring the Engliſh rebels. Sir William
Drury was afterwards ſent with a body of troops, and he threw down the
houſes of the Hamiltons, who were engaged in the ſame faction. The
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh armies were afterwards recalled by agreement with the Queen of
Scots, who promiſed, that no French troops ſhould be introduced into
Scotland, and that the Engliſh rebels ſhould, by her partizans, be
delivered up to the Queen<note n="*" place="bottom">Leſly, p. 91.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' the Queen, covering herſelf with the pretence of
revenging her own quarrel, ſo far contributed to ſupport the party of the
young King, ſhe was cautious not to declare openly againſt the Queen of
Scots; and ſh even ſent a <pb n="518" facs="tcp:0429000102:121"/> requeſt, which was equal
to a command, to the enemies of that princeſs, not to elect, during ſome
time, a regent in the place of Murray<note n="†" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 240.</note>. Lenox, the King's grandfather, was,
therefore, choſen temporary governor, under the title of Lieutenant. Hearing
afterwards, that Mary's partizans, inſtead of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Weſtmoreland,
and the other fugitives, as they had promiſed, had allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to eſcape
into Flanders; ſhe permitted the King's party to give Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox the title of
regent<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 241.</note>, and ſhe ſent
Randolf, as her reſident, to maintain a correſpondence with him. But
notwithſtanding this ſlep, taken in favour of Mary's enemies, ſhe never
laid aſide her ambiguous conduct, or quitted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of amity to
that princeſs. Being importuned by the biſhop of Roſs, and her other
agents, as well as by foreign ambaſſadors, ſhe twice procured a
ſuſpenſion of arms between the Scotch factions, and by that means
ſtopped the hands of the regent, who was likely to obtain advantages over the
oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 243.</note>. By
theſe ſeeming contrarieties ſhe kept alive the factions in Scotland,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their mutual animoſity, and rendered the whole country a ſcene
of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation and of miſery<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Crawford, p.

to conquer the kingdom, and conſequently no intereſt nor deſign to
inſtigate the parties againſt each other; but this conſequence was an
accidental effect of her cautious politics, by which ſhe was engaged, as far
as poſſible, to keep on good terms with the Queen of Scots, and never to
violate the appearances of friendſhip with her, at leaſt thoſe of
neutrality<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir James Melvil, p. 108, 109, aſcribes to
Elizabeth a poſitive deſign of animating the Scotch facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt

other authorities, and is, indeed, contrary to her poſterior conduct, as well
as her intereſts, and the neceſſity of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was plainly
her intereſt, that the King's party ſhould prevail, and nothing could have
engaged her to ſtop their progreſs, or even forbear from openly
aſſiſting them, but her intention of ſtill amuſing the Queen of
Scots, by the hopes of being peaceably reſtored to her throne. See farther,
Strype, vol. II. Appen. p. 20.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE better to amuſe Mary with the proſpect of an
accommodation, Cecil and Sir Walter Mildway were ſent to her, with
propoſals from Elizabeth. The terms were ſomewhat rigorous, ſuch as a
captive Queen might expect from a jealous rival; and they thereby bore the
greater appearance of ſincerity on the part of the Engliſh court. It was
required, that the Queen of Scots, beſides renouncing all title to the crown
of England during the life-time of Elizabeth, ſhould make a perpetual league,
offenſive and defenſive, between the kingdoms; that ſhe ſhould marry no
Engliſhman without Elizabeth's conſent, nor any other perſon without the
conſent of the ſtates of Scotland; that redreſs ſhould be made 
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:0429000102:122"/> for the late ravages committed in England; that
juſtice ſhould be executed on the murderers of the late King; that the
young prince ſhould be ſent into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to be educated there; that ſix
hoſtages, all of them noblemen, ſhould be delivered to the Queen of
England, with the caſtle of Hume, and ſome other fortreſs, for the
ſecurity of performance<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwoood, p. 245.
Leſly, 101.</note>. Such were the conditions upon which Elizabeth promiſed
to contribute her endeavours towards the reſtoration of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Queen.
The neceſſity of Mary's affairs obliged her to conſent to them; and the
Kings of France and Spain, as well as the pope, when conſulted by her,
approved of her conduct; chiefly on account of the civil wars by which all
Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope was at that time agitated, and which incapacitated the catholic princes
from giving her any aſſiſtance<note n="†" place="bottom">Leſly, p.
109, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH'S commiſſioners propoſed alſo to Mary a plan
of accommodation with her ſubjects in Scotland; and after ſome reaſoning
on that head, it was agreed, that the Queen ſhould require Lenox, the regent,
to ſend up commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, to treat of conditions under her mediation.
The partizans of Mary boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all terms were fully ſettled with the
court of England, and that the Scotch rebels would ſoon be conſtrained to
ſubmit to the reſtoration of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign: But Elizabeth took care
that theſe rumours ſhould meet with no credit, and that the King's party
ſhould not be diſcouraged, nor ſink too low in their demands. Cecil wrote
to inform the regent, that all the Queen of England's propoſals, ſo far
from being fixed and irrevocable, were to be diſcuſſed anew in the
conference; and deſired him to ſend commiſſioners, who ſhould be
conſtant to the King's cauſe, and cautious not to make conceſſions
which might be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to their party<note n="‡" place="bottom">Spotſwood p. 245.</note>. Suſſex alſo, in his letters,
dropped hints to the ſame purpoſe; and Elizabeth herſelf ſaid to the

would not inſiſt on Mary's reſtoration, provided the Scotch could make

their arguments, with examples drawn from the Scotch hiſtory, with the
authority of laws, and with the ſentiments of many famous divines. The

told the Scotch commiſſioners, that ſhe was no-wiſe ſatisfied with
their reaſons for juſtifying the conduct of their countrymen; and that they
might therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to propoſe the conditions, which they required for
their ſecurity<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 248, 249.</note>. They
replied, that their commiſſion did not empower them to treat of any terms,
which might infringe the title and ſovereignty of their young king; but they
would gladly hear whatever propoſals ſhould be made them by her majeſty.
The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, recommended by the Queen, were not diſadvantageous to Mary;
but as the commiſſioners ſtill inſiſted, that they were not
authorized to treat, in any manner, concerning the reſtoration of that
Princeſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Haynes, 623.</note>, the conferences
were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily at an end; and Elizabeth diſmiſſed the Scotch
commiſſioners with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, that they ſhould return, after having
procured more ample powers from their Parliament<note n="‡" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 249, 250, &amp;c. Leſly, p. 133, 136. Camden, p.

council, that they had abuſed his miſtreſs by fair promiſes and
profeſſions; and Mary herſelf was no longer at a loſs to judge of
Elizabeth's inſincerity. By reaſon of theſe diſappointments, matters
came ſtill nearer to extremity between the two Princeſſes; and the Queen
of Scots, finding all her hopes eluded, was more ſtrongly incited to make, at
all hazards, every poſſible attempt for her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and ſecurity.</p>
               <p>AN incident alſo happened about this time, which tended to
widen the breach between Mary and Elizabeth, and to encreaſe the vigilance
and jealouſy of the latter Princeſs. Pope Pius the fifth, who had
ſucceeded Paul, after having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in vain to conciliate by gentle
means the friendſhip of Elizabeth, whom his predeceſſor's violence had
irritated, iſſued at laſt a bull of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication againſt her,
deprived her of all title to the crown, and abſolved her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from
their oaths of allegiance<note n="‖" place="bottom">Camden, p.

made in concert with Mary, who intended by that means to forward the northern
rebellion; a meaſure, which was at that time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid p. 441, from Caietanus Life of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

affixed this bull to the gates of the biſhop of London's palace; and

received the crown of martyrdom, for which he appears to have entertained ſo

                  <note place="margin">2d of April. A Parliament.</note> A new
Parliament, after five years interval, was aſſembled at Weſtminſter;
and as the Queen, by the rage of the pope againſt her, was become ſtill
more <pb n="521" facs="tcp:0429000102:124"/> the head of the ruling party, it might be expected,
both from this incident and from her own prudent and vigorous conduct, that her
authority over the two houſes would be abſolutely uncontrouleable. It was
ſo in fact; yet is it remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that it prevailed not without ſome
ſmall oppoſition; and that too ariſing chiefly from the height of zeal
for proteſtantiſm; a diſpoſition of the Engliſh, which, in general,
contributed extremely to encreaſe the Queen's popularity. We ſhall be
ſomewhat particular in relating the tranſactions of this feſſion,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhow, as well the extent of the royal power during that age,
as the diſpoſition of Elizabeth and the genius of her government. It will
be curious alſo to obſerve the faint dawnings of the ſpirit of liberty in
the Engliſh, the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy with which that ſpirit was repreſſed by
the ſovereign, the imperious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which was maintained in oppoſition to
it, and the eaſe with which it was ſubdued by this arbitrary
Princeſs.</p>
               <p>THE Lord keeper, Bacon, after the ſpeaker of the commons was
elected, told the Parliament, in the Queen's name, that ſhe enjoined them not
to meddle with any matters of ſtate<note n="†" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p.
141.</note>: Such was his expreſſion; by which he probably meant, the
queſtions of the Queen's marriage and the ſucceſſion, about which they
had before given her ſome trouble: For as to the other great points of
government, alliances, peace and war, or foreign negotiations; no Parliament in
that age ever had the preſumption to take them under conſideration, or
queſtion, in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, the conduct of their ſovereign.</p>
               <p>IN the former Parliament, the puritans had introduced ſeven
bills for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reformation in religion; but they had not been able to
prevail in any one of them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 185.</note>.
This houſe of commons had ſat a very few days, when Stricland, a member,
revived one of the bills, that for the amendment of the liturgy<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 156, 157.</note>. The chief objection, which
he mentioned, was the ſign of the croſs in baptiſm. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member
added, the kneeling at the ſacrament; and remarked, that if a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of
humiliation was requiſite in that act of devotion, it were better, that the
communicants ſhould throw themſelves proſtrate on the ground, in order to
keep at the wideſt diſtance from former ſuperſtition<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 167.</note>.</p>
               <p>RELIGION was a point, of which Elizabeth was, if poſſible,
ſtill more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than of matters of ſtate. She pretended, that, in
quality of ſupreme head or governor of the church, ſhe was fully empowered,
by her prerogative alone, to decide all queſtions which might ariſe with
regard to doctrine, diſcipline, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and ſhe never would allow
her Parliaments ſo much as to take theſe points <pb n="522" facs="tcp:0429000102:125"/> into
conſideration<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 158.</note>. The courtiers
forgot not to inſiſt on this topic: The treaſurer of the houſhold, tho'
he allowed, that any hereſy might be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Parliament, (a
conceſſion which ſeems to have been very raſh and unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſince
the act, inveſting the crown with the ſupremacy, or rather acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that prerogative, gave the ſovereign full power to reform all hereſies) yet
he affirmed, that it belonged to the Queen alone, as head of the church, to
regulate every queſtion of ceremony in worſhip<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 166.</note>. The comptroller ſeconded this argument;
inſiſted on the extent of the Queen's prerogative; and ſaid, that the
houſe might, from former examples, have taken warning not to meddle with
ſuch matters. One Piſtor oppoſed theſe remonſtrances of the
courtiers. He was ſcandalized, he ſaid, that affairs of ſuch infinite
conſequence (viz. kneeling and making the ſign of the croſs) ſhould be
paſſed over ſo lightly. Theſe queſtions, he added, concern the
ſalvation of our ſouls, and intereſt every one of us more deeply than the
monarchy of the whole world. This cauſe he ſhewed to be God's; the reſt
were all but terrene, yea trifles in compariſon, call you them ever ſo
great: Subſidies, crowns, kingdoms, he knew not what weight they had, when
laid in the ballance with ſubjects of ſuch unſpeakable importance<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Tho' the zeal of this member ſeems to
have been highly approved of, the houſe, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by the prerogative, voted
upon the queſtion, that a petition ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her majeſty,
for her licence to proceed farther in this bill; and in the mean time to ſtop
all debate or reaſoning concerning it<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p.
167.</note>.</p>
               <p>MATTERS would probably have reſted here, had not the Queen
been ſo highly offended with Stricland's preſumption, in moving the bill
for reformation of the liturgy, that ſhe ſent for him to the council, and
prohibited him thenceforth to appear in the houſe of commons<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 175.</note>. That act of power was too
violent even for this ſubmiſſive Parliament to endure. Carleton took
notice of the matter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that the liberties of the houſe were
violated; obſerved that Stricland was not a private man, but repreſented a
multitude; and moved, that he might be ſent for, and if he was guilty of any
offence, might anſwer for it at the bar of the houſe, which he inſinuated
to be the only competent tribunal<note n="**" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.
Yelverton enforced the principles of liberty with ſtill greater boldneſs.
He ſaid, that the precedent was dangerous: And tho' in this happy time of
lenity, among ſo many good and honourable perſonages as were at preſent
inveſted with authority, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of extremity or injury was to be
apprehended; yet the times might alter; what now is permitted, hereafter might
be conſtrued as duty, and might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced <pb n="523" facs="tcp:0429000102:126"/> even on
the ground of the preſent permiſſion. He added, that all matters not
treaſonable, or which implied <hi>too much</hi> derogation of the imperial
crown, might, without offence, be introduced into Parliament; where every
queſtion that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the community, muſt be conſidered, and where
even the right of the crown itſelf muſt finally be determined. He remarked,
that men ſat not in that houſe in their private capacities, but as elected
by their country; and tho' it was proper, that the prince ſhould retain his
prerogative, yet was that preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive limited by law: As the ſovereign could
not of himſelf make laws, neither could he break them, merely from his own
authority<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 175, 176.</note>.</p>
               <p>THESE principles were popular, and noble, and generous; but the
open aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them was ſomewhat new in England: And the courtiers
were more war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by preſent practice, when they advanced a contrary
doctrine. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer warned the houſe to be cautious in their
proceedings; neither to venture farther than their aſſured warrant might
extend, nor hazard their good opinion with her majeſty in any doubtful
cauſe. The member, he ſaid, whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, was not detained on
account of any liberty of ſpeech, but for the exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bill in the
houſe againſt the prerogative of the Queen; a temerity which was not to be
tolerated. And he concluded with obſerving, that even ſpeeches made in that
houſe, have been queſtioned and examined by the ſovereign<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 175.</note>. Cleere, another member,
remarked, that the ſovereign's prerogative is not ſo much as diſputable,
and that the ſafety of the Queen is the ſafety of the ſubjects. He added,
that in queſtions of divinity, every man was for his inſtruction to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to his ordinary; and he ſeems to imply, that the biſhops themſelves, for
their inſtruction, muſt repair to the Queen<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Mr. Fleetwood obſerved, that, in his memory, he
knew a man, who, in the fifth of the preſent Queen, had been called to
account for a ſpeech in the houſe. But left this example ſhould be
eſteemed too recent, he would inform them, from the parliament rolls, that in
the reign of Henry the fifth, a biſhop was committed to priſon by the
King's command, on account of his freedom of ſpeech; and the Parliament
preſumed not to go farther than to be humble ſuitors for him: In the
ſubſequent reign, the ſpeaker himſelf was committed, with another
member; and the houſe found no other remedy than a like ſubmiſſive
application. He adviſed the houſe to have recourſe to the ſame
expedient; and not to preſume, either to ſend for their member, or demand
him as of right<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>. During this ſpeech, thoſe members of the
council who ſat in the houſe, whiſpered together; upon which the
ſpeaker moved, that the houſe ſhould make ſtay of all farther
proceedings: A motion, <pb n="524" facs="tcp:0429000102:127"/> which was immediately complied
with. The Queen, finding that the experiment which ſhe had made, was likely
to excite a great commotion, ſaved her honour by this ſilence of the
houſe; and that the queſtion might no more be reſumed, ſhe ſent next
day to Stricland her permiſſion to give his attendance in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 176.</note>.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this rebuke from the throne, the zeal of the
commons ſtill engaged them to continue the diſcuſſion of thoſe other
bills which regarded religion; but they were interrupted by a ſtill more
arbitrary proceeding of the Queen, in which the lords condeſcended to be her
inſtrument. That houſe ſent a meſſage to the commons, deſiring that
a committee might attend them. Some members were accordingly appointed for that
purpoſe; and the upper houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them, that the Queen's majeſty

approved of them, intended to publiſh them, and to make the biſhops execute

England: But that ſhe would not permit them to be treated of in
Parliament<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 180, 185.</note>. The

injunction, ſeem no-wiſe to have been offended at ſuch haughty treatment;
and in the iſſue all their bills came to nothing.</p>
               <p>A MOTION, made by Robert Bell, a puritan, againſt an
excluſive patent grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a company of merchants at Briſtol<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 158.</note>, gave alſo occaſion to
ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able incidents. The Queen, ſome days after the motion was made,
ſent her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by the mouth of the ſpeaker, commanding the houſe to
ſpend little time in motions, and to avoid long ſpeeches. All the members
underſtood that ſhe had been offended, becauſe a matter had been moved
which ſeemed to touch her prerogative<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p.
159.</note>. Fleetwood accordingly ſpoke of this delicate ſubject. He
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the Queen had a prerogative of granting patents; that to
queſtion the validity of any patent, was to invade the royal prerogative;
that all foreign trade was entirely ſubjected to the pleaſure of the
ſovereign; that even the ſtatute which gave liberty of commerce, admitted
of all prohibitions from the crown; and that the prince, when he granted an
excluſive patent, only employed the power veſted in him, and prohibited all
others from dealing in any particular branch of commerce. He quoted the Clerk
of the Parliament's book, to prove, that no man might ſpeak in Parliament of
the ſtatute of wills, unleſs the King firſt gave licence; becauſe the
royal prerogative in the wards was thereby touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He ſhewed likewiſe the
ſtatutes of Edward the firſt, Edward the third, and Henry the fourth, with
a ſaving of the prerogative. And in Edward the ſixth's 
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:0429000102:128"/> time, the protector was applied to, for his allowance to
mention matters of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p.
160.</note>.</p>
               <p>SIR Humphrey Gilbert, the gallant ſea-adventurer, carried
theſe topics ſtill farther. He endeavoured to prove, the motion made by
Bell; to be a vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and perillous to be treated of; ſince it tended
to the derogation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative imperial, which, whoever ſhould attempt
ſo much as in fancy, could not, he ſaid, be otherwiſe accounted than an
open enemy. For what difference is there between ſaying, that the Queen is
not to uſe the privilege of the crown, and ſaying that ſhe is not Queen?
And tho' experience has ſhewn ſo much cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency in her majeſty, as might,
perhaps, make the ſubjects forget their duty; it is not good to ſport or
venture too much with princes. He remembered them of the fable of the hare,
who, upon the proclamation, that all horned beaſts ſhould depart the court,
immediately fled, leſt his ears ſhould be conſtrued to be horns; and by
this apologue he ſeems to inſinuate, that even thoſe who heard or
permitted ſuch dangerous ſpeeches, would not themſelves be entirely free
from danger. He deſired them to beware, leſt, if they meddled farther with
theſe matters, the Queen might look to her own power, and finding herſelf
able to ſuppreſs their challenged liberty, and to exert an arbitrary
authority, might imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the example of Lewis the eleventh of France, who, as
he termed it, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the crown from wardſhip<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 168.</note>.</p>
               <p>THO' this ſpeech gave ſome diſguſt, no body, at the
time, replied any thing, but that Sir Humphrey miſtook the meaning of the
houſe, and of the member who made the motion: They never had other purpoſe,
than to repreſent their grievances in due and ſeemly form unto her
majeſty. But, in a ſubſequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Peter Wentworth, a man of a
ſuperior free ſpirit, called that ſpeech an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult on the houſe;
noted Sir Humphrey's diſpoſition to flatter and fawn on the prince;
compared him to the cameleon, which can change itſelf into all colours,
except white; and recommended to the houſe, a due care of liberty of
ſpeech, and of the privileges of Parliament<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 175.</note>. It appears, on the whole, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the excluſive patent had no effect. Bell, the member who firſt
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it, was ſent for by the council, and was ſeverely reprimanded
for his temerity. He returned to the houſe with ſuch an amazed countenance,
that all the members, well informed of the reaſon, were ſtruck with terror;
and during ſome time, no one durſt riſe to ſpeak of any matter of
importance, for fear of giving offence to the Queen and the council. Even after
the fears of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were ſomewhat abated, the members ſpoke with
extreme precaution; and <pb n="526" facs="tcp:0429000102:129"/> by employing moſt of their
diſcourſe in preambles and apologies, they ſhewed their conſcious
terror of the rod which was hanging over them. Wherever any delicate point was
touched; tho' ever ſo gently; nay ſeemed to be approached, tho' at ever
ſo great a diſtance, the whiſper ran about the houſe, 
<q rend="inline">"The Queen will be offended; the council will be
extremely diſpleaſed:"</q> And by theſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes men were warned of
the danger to which they expoſed themſelves. It is remarkable, that the
patent which the Queen defended with ſuch imperious vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, was contrived
for the profit of four courtiers, and was attended with the utter ruin of
ſeven or eight thouſand of her induſtrious ſubjects<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 242.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">29th May.</note> THUS every thing which
paſſed the two houſes, was extremely reſpectful and ſubmiſſive;
yet did the Queen think it incumbent on her, at the concluſion of the
ſeſſion, to check, and that with great ſeverity, thoſe feeble efforts
for liberty, which had appeared in the motions and ſpeeches of ſome
members. The lord keeper told the commons, in her majeſty's name, that, tho'
the majority of the lower houſe had ſhewed themſelves, in their
proceedings, diſcreet, and dutiful, yet a few of them had diſcovered a
contrary character, and had juſtly merited the reproach of audacious,
arrogant, and preſumptuous: Contrary to their duty, both as ſubjects and
parliament-men, nay contrary to the expreſs injunctions given them from the
throne at the beginning of the ſeſſion; injunctions, which it might well
have become them to have better attended to; they had preſumed to call in
queſtion her majeſty's grants and prerogatives. But her majeſty warns
them, that ſince they will thus wilfully forget themſelves, they are
otherwiſe to be admoniſhed: Some other ſpecies of correction muſt be
found for them; ſince neither the commands of her majeſty, nor the example
of their wiſer brethren, can reclaim their audacious, arrogant, and
preſumptuous folly, by which they are thus led to meddle with what no way
belongs to them, and what lies not within the compaſs of their
underſtanding<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 151.</note>.</p>
               <p>IN all theſe tranſactions appears clearly the opinion which
Elizabeth had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of the duty and authority of Parliaments. They were
not to canvaſs any matters of ſtate: Still leſs were they to meddle with
the church. Queſtions of either kind were far above their reach, and were
appropriated to the prince alone, or to thoſe councils and miniſters with
whom he was pleaſed to entruſt them. What then was the office of
Parliaments? They might give directions for the due tanning of leather, or
milling of cloth; for the preſervation of phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants and partridges; for
the reparation of bridges and highways; for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of vagabonds or
common beggars. Regulations concerning the police of the country came properly
under their inſpection; and the laws of this kind <pb n="527" facs="tcp:0429000102:130"/>
which they preſcribed, had, if not a greater, yet a more durable authority,
than thoſe derived ſolely from the proclamations of the ſovereign.
Precedents or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports could fix a rule for deciſions in private property, or
the puniſhment of crimes; but no alteration or innovation in the municipal
law could proceed from any other ſource than the Parliament; nor would the
courts of juſtice be induced to change their eſtabliſhed practice by an
order of council. But the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable part of parliamentary
tranſactions was the granting of ſubſidies; the attainting and
puniſhing the obnoxious nobility, or any miniſter of ſtate after his
fall; the countenancing ſuch great efforts of power, as might be deemed
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what exceptionable, where they proceeded entirely from the ſovereign.
The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of grievances was ſometimes promiſed to the people; but
ſeldom could have place, while it was an eſtabliſhed rule, that the
prerogatives of the crown muſt not be abridged, or ſo much as queſtioned
and examined in Parliament. Even tho' monopolies and excluſive companies had
already reached an enormous height, and were every day encreaſing, to the
deſtruction of all liberty, and extinction of all induſtry; it was criminal
in a member to propoſe, in the moſt dutiful and regular manner, a
parliamentary application againſt any of them.</p>
               <p>THESE maxims of government were not kept ſecret by Elizabeth,
or ſmoothed over by any fair appearances or plauſible pretences. They were
openly avowed in her ſpeeches and meſſages to Parliament; and were
accompanied with all the haughtineſs, nay ſometimes bitterneſs of
expreſſion, which the meaneſt ſervant could look for from his offended
maſter. Yet notwithſtanding this conduct, Elizabeth continued the moſt
popular ſovereign that ever ſwayed the ſcepter of England; becauſe the
maxims of her reign were conformable to the principles of the times, and to the
opinion which was generally entertained with regard to the conſtitution. The
continued encroachments of popular aſſemblies on Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's
ſucceſſors have ſo changed our ideas of theſe matters, that the
paſſages above mentioned appear to us extremely curious, and even at
firſt ſurprizing; but they were ſo little remarked, during the time, that
neither Camden, tho' a contemporary writer, nor any other hiſtorian, has
taken any notice of them. So abſolute was the authority of the crown, that
the precious ſpark of liberty had been kindled, and was preſerved, by the
puritans alone; and it was to this ſect, whoſe principles appear ſo
frivolous and habits ſo ridiculous, that the Engliſh owe the whole freedom
of their conſtitution. Actuated by that zeal which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to innovators,
and by the courage which enthuſiaſm inſpires, they hazarded the utmoſt
indignation of their ſovereign; and employing all their induſtry to be
elected into Parliament; a matter not difficult, while a feat was rather
regarded <pb n="528" facs="tcp:0429000102:131"/> as a burthen than an advantage<note n="*" place="bottom">It appeared this ſeſſion, that a bribe of four pounds

and then obtained an aſcendant over the church and monarchy.</p>
               <p>THE following were the principal laws enacted this ſeſſion
of Parliament. It was declared treaſon, during the life-time of the Queen, to
affirm, that ſhe was not the lawful ſovereign, or that any other
poſſeſſed a better title, or that ſhe was an heretic, ſchiſmatic,
or infidel, or that the laws and ſtatutes cannot limit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the
right of the crown and the ſucceſſor thereof: To maintain in writing or
printing, that any perſon, except the <hi>natural iſſue</hi> of her body,
is or ought to be the Queen's heir or ſucceſſor, ſubjected the perſon
and all his abettors, for the firſt offence, to impriſonment during a year,
and to the forfeiture of half their goods: The ſecond offence ſubjected
them to the penalty of a premunire<note n="†" place="bottom">1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Eliz. c. 1.</note>. This law was
plainly leveled againſt the Queen of Scots and her partizans; and implyed an
avowal, that Elizabeth never intended to declare her ſucceſſor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It
may be noted, that the uſual phraſe of <hi>lawful iſſue,</hi> which the
Parliament thought indecent towards the Queen, as if ſhe could be
ſuppoſed to have any other, was changed into that of <hi>natural
iſſue.</hi> But this alteration was the ſource of great ridicule during
the time; and ſome perſons ſuſpected a deeper deſign, as if
Leiceſter intended, in caſe of the Queen's death, to produce ſome
baſtard of his own, and affirm that he was her offspring<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p. 436.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT was alſo enacted, that whoſoever by bulls ſhall
publiſh abſolutions or other reſcripts of the pope, or ſhall by means
of them reconcile any man to the church of Rome, ſuch offenders, as well as
thoſe who were ſo reconciled, ſhould be guilty of treaſon. The penalty
of a premunire was impoſed on every one who imported any <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi>
crucifix, or ſuch other implement of ſuperſtition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the
pope<note n="§" place="bottom">13 Eliz. c. 2.</note>. The former laws
againſt taking intereſt, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated uſury, were enforced by a
new ſtatute<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid. c. 8.</note>. A ſupply of
one ſubſidy and two fifteenths was granted by Parliament. The Queen, as
ſhe was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to yield to them none of her power, was very cautious of
aſking from them any ſupplies. She endeavoured, either by a rigid frugality
to make her ordinary revenues ſuffice for the neceſſities of the crown,
or ſhe employed her prerogative and acquired money by the granting of
patents, monopolies, or by ſome ſuch ruinous expedient.</p>
               <p>THO' Elizabeth poſſeſſed ſuch uncontrouled authority
over her parliaments, and ſuch extenſive influence over her people; tho'
during a courſe of thirteen <pb n="529" facs="tcp:0429000102:132"/> years, ſhe had been able
to maintain the public tranquillity, which was only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the haſty
and ill concerted inſurrection of the north; ſhe was ſtill kept in great
anxiety, and felt her throne perpetually totter under her. The violent
commotions, excited in France and the Low Countries, as well as in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
ſeemed in one view to ſecure her againſt any diſturbance; but they
ſerved, on more reflection, to inſtruct her in the danger of her
ſituation, when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that England, no leſs than theſe
neighbouring countries, contained the ſeeds of inteſtine diſcord, the
differences of religious opinion, and the furious intolerance and animoſity
of the oppoſite ſectaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Civil wars of France.</note> THE league,
formed at Bayonne in 1566 for the extermination of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, had not
been concluded ſo ſecretly but intelligence of it had reached Condé,
Coligni, and the other leaders of the hugonots; and finding, that the
meaſures of the court agreed with their ſuſpicions, they were determined
to prevent the cruel perfidy of their enemies, and to ſtrike a blow before
the catholics were aware of the danger. The hugonots, tho' diſperſed over
the whole kingdom, formed a kind of empire within itſelf; and being cloſely
united, as well by their religious zeal, as by the dangers, to which they were
perpetually expoſed, they obeyed with entire ſubmiſſion the orders of
their leaders, and were ready on every alarm to fly to arms. The King and
Queen-mother were living in great ſecurity at Monceaux in Brie; when they
found themſelves ſurrounded by proteſtant troops, which had ſecretly
marched thither from all quarters; and had not a body of Swiſs come haſtily
to their relief, and conducted them with great intrepidity to Paris, they
muſt have fallen, without reſiſtance, into the hands of the
inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. A battle was afterwards fought in the plains of St. Dennis,
where, tho' the old conſtable Montmorency, the general of the catholics, was
killed combating bravely at the head of his troops, the hugonots were finally
defeated. Condé collecting his broken troops, and receiving a ſtrong
reinforcement from the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man proteſtants, appeared again in the field; and
laying ſiege to Chartres, a place of great importance, obliged the court to
agree to a new accommodation. Such was the mutual animoſity of theſe
religioniſts, that, even had the leaders on both ſides been ever ſo
ſincere in their intentions for peace, and repoſed ever ſo great
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in each other, it would have been difficult to have retained the
people in tranquillity; much more, where ſuch extreme jealouſy prevailed,
and where the court employed every pacification as a ſnare for their enemies.
A plan was laid for ſeizing the perſon of the prince and admiral; who
narrowly eſcaped to Rochelle, and ſummoned their partizans to their
aſſiſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">Davila, lib. 4.</note>. The civil wars
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:0429000102:133"/> were renewed with greater fury than ever, and the
parties became ſtill more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated againſt each other. The young duke
of Anjou, brother to the King, commanded the forces of the catholics; and
fought in 1569 a great battle at Jarnac with the hugonots, where the prince of
Condé was killed, and his army defeated. This diſcomfiture, with the
loſs of ſo great a leader, reduced not the hugonots to deſpair. The
admiral ſtill ſupported the cauſe; and having placed at the head of the
proteſtants, the prince of Navarre, then ſixteen years of age, and the
young prince of Condé, he encouraged the party rather to periſh
bravely in the field, than ignominiouſly by the hands of the executioner. He
collected ſuch numbers, ſo determined to endure every extremity, that he
was enabled to make head againſt the duke of Anjou; and being ſtrengthened
by a new reinforcement of Germans, he obliged that prince to retreat and to
divide his forces. Coligni then laid ſiege to Poitiers; and as the eyes of
all France were turned on this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, the duke of Guiſe, emulous of the
renown, which his father had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the defence of Metz, threw himſelf
into the place, and ſo animated the garriſon by his valour and conduct,
that the admiral was obliged to raiſe the ſiege. Such was the commencement
of that unrivaled fame and grandeur, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attained by this duke of
Guiſe. The attachment, which all the catholics had borne to his father, was
immediately transferred to the ſon; and men pleaſed themſelves in
comparing all the great and heroic qualities, which ſeemed, in a manner,
hereditary in that family. Equal in affability, in munificence, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
in eloquence, and in every quality, which engages the affections of men; equal
alſo in valour, in conduct, in enterprize, in capacity; there ſeemed only
this difference between them, that the ſon, educated in more turbulent times,
and finding a greater diſſolution of all law and order, exceeded the father
in ambition and temerity, and was engaged in enterprizes ſtill more
deſtructive to the authority of his ſovereign and to the repoſe of his
native country.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH, who kept her attention fixed on the civil commotions
of France, was no wiſe pleaſed with this new riſe of her enemies, the
Guiſes; and being anxious for the fate of the proteſtants, whoſe
intereſts were connected with her own<note n="*" place="bottom">Haynes, p.
471.</note>, ſhe was engaged, notwithſtanding her averſion againſt all
rebellion, and all oppoſition to the will of the ſovereign, to give them
ſecretly ſome aſſiſtance. Beſides employing her authority with the
German princes, ſhe ſent money to the Queen of Navarre, and received ſome
jewels as pledges for the loan. And ſhe permitted Henry Champernon to levy,
and tranſport over into France, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of an hundred gentlemen
voluntiers; among whom Walter Raleigh, then a young man, began to
diſtinguiſh himſelf in that great ſchool of military va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 423.</note>.
The admiral, conſtrained by the impatience of his troops, and by the
difficulty of ſubſiſting them, fought with the duke of Anjou, the battle
of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contour in Poictou, where he was wounded and defeated. The court of
France, notwithſtanding their frequent experience of the obſtinacy of the
hugonots, and the vigour of Coligni, vainly flattered themſelves that the
force of the rebels was at laſt finally annihilated; and they neglected
farther preparations againſt a foe, who, they thought, could never more
become dangerous. They were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to hear, that that leader had appeared
in another quarter of the kingdom; had encouraged the young princes, whom he
governed, to equal conſtancy; had aſſembled an army; had taken the field;
and was even ſtrong enough to threaten Paris. The public finances,
diminiſhed by the continued diſorders of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and waſted by ſo
many fruitleſs military enterprizes, could no longer bear the charge of a new
armament; and the King, notwithſtanding his extreme ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity againſt
the hugonots, was obliged, in 1570, to conclude an accommodation with them, to
grant them a pardon for all paſt offences, and to renew the edicts for
liberty of conſcience.</p>
               <p>THO' a pacification was ſeemingly concluded, the mind of
Charles was no way reconciled to his rebellious ſubjects; and this
accommodation, like all the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was nothing but a ſnare, by which the
perfidious court had projected to deſtroy at once, without danger, all its
formidable enemies. As the two young princes, the admiral, and all the leaders
of the hugonots, inſtructed by paſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, diſcovered an extreme
diſtruſt of the King's intentions, and kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſecurity, at
a diſtance, all poſſible artifices were employed to remove their
apprehenſions, and convince them of the ſincerity of the new councils,
which ſeemed to be embraced. The terms of the peace were exactly obſerved
to them; the toleration was regularly maintained; all attempts, made by the
zealous catholics to infringe it, were puniſhed with ſeverity; offices, and
favours, and honours were beſtowed on the principal nobility among the
proteſtants; and the King and council every where declared, that, tired of
civil diſorders, and convinced of the impoſſibility of forcing men's
conſcience, they were thenceforth determined to allow every one the free
exerciſe of his religion.</p>
               <p>AMONG the other artifices, employed to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ull the proteſtants into a fatal
ſecurity, Charles aſſected to enter into cloſe connexions with
Elizabeth; and as it ſeemed not the intereſt of France to forward the union
of the two kingdoms of Great Britain, that princeſs the more eaſily
flattered herſelf, that the French monarch would prefer her friendſhip to
that of the Queen of Scots. The better to deceive her, propoſals of marriage
were made her with the duke of Anjou; a prince <pb n="532" facs="tcp:0429000102:135"/> whoſe
youth, beauty, and reputation for valour might naturally be ſuppoſed to
recommend him to a woman, who had appeared not altogether indifferent to
theſe endowments. The Queen immediately founded on this offer the project of
deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the court of France; and being intent on the artifice of that
ſcheme, ſhe laid herſelf the more open to be deceived. Negotiations were
entered into with regard to the marriage; terms of the contract were
propoſed; difficulties ſtarted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and the two courts, equally
inſincere, tho' not equally criminal, ſeemed to approach every day nearer
each other in their demands and conceſſions. The great obſtacle ſeemed
to lie in adjuſting the differences of religion; becauſe Elizabeth, who
recommended toleration to Charles, was determined not to grant it in her own
dominions, not even to her huſband; and the duke of Anjou ſeemed unwilling
to ſubmit, for the ſake of intereſt, to the diſhonour of an
apoſtacy<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p 433. Davila<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. 5. Digges's

               <p>THE artificial politics of Elizabeth never triumphed ſo much
in any contivances as in thoſe which were conjoined with her coquetry; and as
her character in this particular was generally known, the court of France
thought that they might, without danger of forming any final concluſion,
venture the farther in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions and offers to her. The Queen
alſo had other motives for diſſimulation. Beſides the advantage of
diſcouraging Mary's partizans by the proſpect of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance between
France and England, her ſituation with Philip demanded her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
vigilance and attention; and the preſent revolutions in the Low Countries
made her glad of fortifying herſelf even with the appearance of a new
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Affairs of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> THE
theological controverſies, which had long agitated Europe, had, from the
beginning, penetrated into the Low Countries; and as theſe provinces
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a very extenſive commerce, they had early received from every
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with which they correſponded, a tincture of religious innovation.
An opinion at that time prevailed, which had been zealouſly propagated by the
prieſts, and implicitly received by ſovereigns, that hereſy was cloſely
connected with rebellion, and that every great or violent alteration in the
church involved a like revolution in the ſtate and civil government. The
forward zeal of the reformers would ſeldom allow them to wait the conſent
of the magiſtrate to their innovations; they became leſs dutiful when they
were oppoſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted; and tho' their pretended ſpirit of
reaſoning and enquiry was in reality nothing but a new ſpecies of implicit
faith, the prince took the alarm; as if no inſtitutions could be ſecure
from the temerity of their reſearches. The emperor <pb n="533" facs="tcp:0429000102:136"/>
Charles, who propoſed to augment his authority under the pretence of
defending the catholic faith, eaſily adopted theſe political principles;
and notwithſtanding the limited prerogative, which he poſſeſſed in
the Netherlands, he publiſhed the moſt arbitrary, ſevere, and tyrannical

ſo far from anſwering the purpoſe intended, had rather ſerved to
augment the numbers as well as zeal of the reformers; and the magiſtrates of
the ſeveral towns, ſeeing no end of thoſe barbarous executions, felt
their humanity rebel againſt their principles, and declined any farther
perſecution of the new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines.</p>
               <p>WHEN Philip ſucceeded to his father's dominions, the Flemings
were juſtly alarmed with new apprehenſions; leſt their prince,
obſerving the lenity of the magiſtrates, ſhould take the execution of the
edicts from ſuch remiſs hands, and eſtabliſh the inquiſition in the
Low Countries, accompanied with all the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and barbarities which
attended it in Spain. The ſevere and unrelenting character of the man, his
profeſſed attachment to Spaniſh manners, the inflexible bigotry of his
principles; all theſe circumſtances encreaſed their terror: And when he
left the Netherlands, with a known intention never to return, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
of the inhabitants was extremely augmented, and their dread of thoſe
tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical orders, which their ſovereign, ſurrounded with Spaniſh
miniſters, would iſſue from his cabinet of Madrid. He left the dutcheſs
of Parma governeſs of the Low Countries; and the natural good ſenſe and
good temper of that princeſs, had ſhe been entruſted with the ſole
power, would have preſerved the ſubmiſſion of thoſe opulent
provinces, which were loſt from that refinement of treacherous and barbarous
politics, on which Philip ſo highly valued himſelf. The Flemings

arbitrarily elected, in order to enforce the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the perſecuting
edicts; and that on the whole, they muſt make ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>count of being reduced to
the condition of a province under the Spaniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. The diſcontents of
the nobility gave countenance to the complaints of the <pb n="534" facs="tcp:0429000102:137"/>
gentry, which encouraged the mutiny of the populace; and all orders of men
ſhowed a ſtrong diſpoſition to revolt. Aſſociations were formed,
tumultuary petitions preſented, names of diſtinction aſſumed, badges of
party diſplayed; and the current of the people, irritated by feeble
reſiſtance, and impelled by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious zeal, roſe to ſuch a height,
that in ſeveral towns, particularly in Antwerp, they made an open invaſion
on the eſtabliſhed worſhip, pillaged the churches and monaſteries,
broke the images, and committed the moſt unwarrantable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>
               <p>THE wiſer part of the nobility, particularly the prince of
Orange, and the counts Egmont and Horn, were alarmed with theſe exceſſes,
to which their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents had at firſt given countenance; and ſeconding
the wiſdom of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs, they ſuppreſſed thoſe dangerous
inſurrections, puniſhed the ringleaders, and reduced all the provinces to a
ſtate of order and ſubmiſſion. But Philip was not contented with the
re-eſtabliſhment of his antient authority: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that
provinces, ſo remote from the ſeat of government, could not be ruled by a
limited prerogative; and that a prince, who muſt entreat rather than command,
would neceſſarily, when he reſided not among the people, feel every day a
diminution of his power and influence. He was determined, therefore, to lay
hold of the late popular mutinies as a pretence for aboliſhing entirely the
privileges of the Low Country provinces; and for ruling them thenceforth with a
military and arbitrary authority. In the execution of this violent deſign, he
employed a man, who was a proper inſtrument in the hands of ſuch a tyrant.
Ferdinand of Toledo, duke of Alva, had been educated entirely amidſt arms;
and having attained a conſummate knowlege in the military art, his habits led
him to transfer into all government the ſevere diſcipline of a camp, and to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no meaſures between prince and ſubject but thoſe of rigid
command and implicit obedience. This general, in 1568, conducted from Italy to
the Low Countries a powerful body of veteran Spaniards; and his avowed
animoſity to the Flemings, with his known character, ſtruck that whole
people with terror and conſternation. It belongs not to our ſubject to
relate at length thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences, which Alva's natural barbarity, ſteeled
by reflection, and aggravated by inſolence, exerciſed on thoſe
flouriſhing provinces. It ſuffices to ſay, that all their privileges, the
gift of ſo many princes and the inheritance of ſo many ages, were openly
and expreſsly aboliſhed by edict; arbitrary and ſanguinary tribunals
erected; the counts Fgmont and Horn, notwithſtanding their great merits and
paſt ſervices, brought to the ſcaffold; multitudes of all ranks thrown
into pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on; and thence delivered
over to the executioner: And notwithſtanding the peaceable 
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:0429000102:138"/> ſubmiſſion of all men, nothing was heard of but
confiſcation, impriſonment, exile, torture, and death.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH was equally diſpleaſed to ſee the progreſs of
that ſcheme, laid for the extermination of the proteſtants, and to
obſerve the erection of ſo great a military power, in a ſtate ſituated
ſo near her. She gave protection to all the Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh exiles who took
ſhelter in her dominions; and as many of theſe were the moſt
induſtrious inhabitants of the Netherlands, and had rendered that country
ſo celebrated for its arts, ſhe reaped the advantage of introducing into
England ſome uſeful manufactures, which were formerly unknown in that
kingdom. Foreſeeing that the violent government of Alva could not long
ſubſiſt without exciting ſome commotion, ſhe ventured to commit an
inſult upon him, which ſhe would have been cautious not to hazard againſt
a more eſtabliſhed authority. Some Genoeſe merchants had engaged by
contract with Philip, to tranſport into Flanders the ſum of four hundred
thouſand crowns; and the veſſels in which this money was embarked, had
been attacked in the Channel by ſome privateers equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the French
Hugonots, and had taken ſhelter in Plymouth and Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. The commanders
of the ſhips pretended, that the money belonged to the King of Spain; but the
Queen finding, upon enquiry, that it was the property of Genoeſe merchants,
took poſſeſſion of it as a loan; and by that means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the duke
of Alva of this reſource in the time of his greateſt neceſſity. Alva,
in revenge, ſeized all the Engliſh merchants in the Low Countries, threw
them into priſon, and confiſcated their effects. The Queen retaliated by a
like violence on the Flemiſh and Spaniſh merchants; and gave all the
Engliſh liberty to make reprizals on the ſubjects of Philip. Theſe
differences were afterwards accommodated by treaty, and mutual reparations were
made to the merchants: But nothing could repair the loſs which ſo
well-timed a blow inflicted on the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh government in the Low Countries.
Alva, in want of money, and dreading the immediate mutiny of his troops, to
whom large arrears were due, impoſed by his arbitrary will the moſt ruinous
taxes on the people. He not only required the hundredth penny, and the
twentieth of all immoveable goods: He alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the tenth of all
moveable goods on every ſale; an abſurd tyranny, which would not only have
deſtroyed all arts and commerce, but even have reſtrained the common
intercourſe of life. The people refuſed compliance: The duke had recourſe
to his uſual expedient of hanging: And thus matters came ſtill nearer the

<note place="margin">New conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the duke of
Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk.</note> There was one Radolphi, a Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine merchant, who had
reſided about fifteen years at London, and who, at the ſame time that he
conducted his commerce in England, had managed all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of the court
of Rome with the catholic nobility and gentry<note n="‖" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 123. State Trials, vol. I. p. 87.</note>. He had been
thrown into priſon at the time when the duke of Norfolk's intrigues with Mary
were diſcovered; but either no proof was found againſt him, or the part
which he had acted was not very criminal; and he ſoon after recovered his
liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This man, zealous for promoting the catholic faith, had formed a
ſcheme, in concert with the Spaniſh ambaſſador, for ſubverting the
government, by a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign invaſion, and a domeſtic inſurrection; and when
he communicated his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by letter, to Mary, he found, that as ſhe was
now fully convinced of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth's artifices, and deſpaired of ever
recovering her authority, or even her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, by pacific meaſures, ſhe
very willingly gave her concurrence. The great number of diſcontented
catholics were the chief ſource of their hopes on the ſide of England; and
they alſo obſerved, that the kingdom was, at that time, full of indigent
gentry, chiefly younger brothers, who having at preſent, by the late decay of
the church, and the yet languiſhing ſtate of commerce, no proſpect of a
livelihood ſuitable to their birth, were ready to throw themſelves into any
deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate enterprize<note n="‡" place="bottom">Leſley, p.
123.</note>. But in order to inſpire ſpirit and courage into all theſe
male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, it was requiſite, that ſome great nobleman ſhould put
himſelf at their head; and no one appeared to Rodolphi, and to the biſhop
of Roſs, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into all theſe intrigues, ſo proper, both on
account of his power and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, as the duke of Norfolk.</p>
               <p>THIS nobleman, when releaſed from confinement in the Tower,
had given his promiſe, that he would drop all intercourſe with the Queen of
Scots<note n="*" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 571.</note>; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had
loſt, and, as he feared, beyond all recovery, the confidence and favour of
Elizabeth, and being ſtill, in ſome degree, reſtrained from his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
he was tempted, by impatience and deſpair, to violate his word, and to open
anew his correſpondence with the captive princeſs<note n="†" place="bottom">State Trials, vol. I. p. 102.</note>. A promiſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was
renewed between them; the duke engaged to enter into all her intereſts; and
as his remorſes gradually decayed in the courſe of theſe tranſactions,
he was puſhed to give his aſſent to enterprizes ſtill more criminal.
Rodolphi's plan was, that the duke of Alva ſhould, under ſome other
pretence, aſſemble a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſhipping in the Low Countries;
ſhould tranſport a body of ſix thouſand foot, and four thouſand
horſe, into England; ſhould land them at Harwich, <pb n="537" facs="tcp:0429000102:140"/>
where the duke of Norfolk was to join them with all his friends; ſhould
thence march directly to London, and oblige the Queen to ſubmit to whatever
conditions the conſpirators ſhould pleaſe to impoſe upon her<note n="‡" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 155. State Trials, vol. I. p. 86,
87.</note>. Norfolk gave his conſent to this plan; and three letters, in
conſequence of it, were wrote in his name by Rodolphi to Alva, the pope, and
the King of Spain; but the duke, apprehenſive of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, refuſed to
ſign them<note n="‖" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 159, 161. Camden, p.
432.</note>. He only ſent to the Spaniſh ambaſſador a ſervant and
confident, named Barker, as well to notify his concurrence in the plan, as to
vouch the authenticity of theſe letters; and Rodolphi, having obtained a
letter of credence from the ambaſſador, proceeded on his journey to
Bruſſels and to Rome. The duke of Alva and the pope embraced the ſcheme
with alacrity: Rodolphi informed Norfolk of their intentions<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">State Trials, vol. I. p. 93.</note>: and every thing ſeemed to
concur in forwarding the undertaking.</p>
               <p>NORFOLK, notwithſtanding theſe criminal enterprizes, had
never entirely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his duty to his ſovereign, his country, and his
religion; and tho' he had laid the plan both for an invaſion and an
inſurrection, he ſtill flattered himſelf, that the innocence of his
intentions would juſtify the violence of his meaſures, and that, as he
aimed at nothing but the liberty of the Queen of Scots, and the obtaining
Elizabeth's conſent to his marriage, he could not juſtly reproach himſelf
as a rebel and a traitor<note n="§" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that, conſidering the Queen's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſpirit, the ſcheme, if
ſucceſsful, muſt finally have ended in her dethrone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and her
authority was here expoſed to the utmoſt danger. The conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy had
hitherto entirely eſcaped the vigilance of Elizabeth, and that of
ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Cecil, who now bore the title of lord Burleigh. It was from
another attempt of Norfolk, that they firſt obtained a hint, which, being
diligently traced, led at laſt to a full diſcovery. Mary had intended to
ſend a ſum of money to lord Herreis, and her partizans in Scotland; and
Norfolk undertook to have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to Banniſter, a ſervant of his, at
that time in the north, who was to find ſome expedient to have it delivered
to lord Herreis<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 169. State Trials, vol. I. p.
87. Camden, p. 434. Digges, p. 134, 137, 140. Strype, vol. II. p. 82.</note>.
He entruſted the money to a ſervant, who was not in the ſecret, and told
him that the bag contained a ſum of ſilver, which he was to deliver to
Banniſter with a letter: But the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, conjecturing from the weight and
ſize of the bag, that it was full of gold, carried the letter to Burleigh;
who immediately ordered Banniſter, Barker, and Hicford, the duke's
ſecretary, to be put under arreſt, and to undergoe a ſevere examination.
The fear of torture made them confeſs the whole truth; and as Hicford, tho'
ordered to burn all papers, had carefully kept them concealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:0429000102:141"/> the mats of the duke's chamber, and under the tiles of
the houſe, full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence now appeared againſt his maſter<note n="†" place="bottom">Leſley, p. 173</note>. Norfolk himſelf, who was
entirely ignorant of the diſcoveries made by his ſervants, was brought
before the council, and tho' exhorted to attone for his guilt by a full
confeſſion, he perſiſted in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every accuſation with which he
was charged. The Queen always declared, that if he had given her this proof of
his ſincere repentance, ſhe would have pardoned all his former
offences<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 175.</note>; but finding him
obſtinate, ſhe committed him to the Tower, and ordered him to be brought to
his trial. The biſhop of Roſs had, on ſome ſuſpicion, been committed
to cuſtody before the diſcovery of Norfolk's guilt; and every expedient was
employed to make him reveal his ſhare in the conſpiracy. He at firſt
inſiſted on his privilege as an ambaſſador; but he was told, that as
his miſtreſs was no longer a ſovereign, he would not be regarded as an
ambaſſador, and that even if that character was allowed, it did not warrant
him in conſpiring againſt the ſovereign in whoſe court he
reſided<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 189. Spotſwood.</note>. As
he ſtill refuſed to anſwer interrogatories, he was informed of the
confeſſion made by Norfolk's ſervants; after which he entertained no
longer any ſcruple to make a full diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and his evidence put the
guilt of that nobleman beyond all queſtion. <label type="milestone">

               <p>THE Queen of Scots was either the occaſion or the cauſe of

herſelf entitled to uſe any expedient for her relief, Elizabeth durſt
not, as yet, form any reſolution of proceeding to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt her.
She only ſent lord Delawar, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Thomas Bromley, and Dr.
Wilſon, to expoſtulate with her, and to require ſatisfaction for all
thoſe parts of her conduct, which, from the beginning of her life, had given
exception to Elizabeth: Her aſſuming the arms of England, refuſing to
ratify the treaty of Edinburgh, her intending to marry Norfolk without the
Queen's conſent, her concurring in the northern rebellion<note n="*" place="bottom">Digges, p. 16, 107. Strype, vol. II. p. 51, 52.</note>,

p. 40, 51.</note>, procuring the pope's bull of excommunication, and allowing
her friends abroad to give her the title of Queen of England. Mary juſtified
herſelf from the ſeveral articles of this charge, either by denying the
facts imputed to her, or by caſting the blame on others<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p. 442.</note>. But the Queen was little ſatisfied with
her apology; and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was ſo enraged againſt her, that the
commons made a direct application for her immediate trial and execution. They
employed ſome topics derived from practice and reaſon, and the laws of
nations; but the chief ſtreſs was laid on paſſages and examples from
the Old Teſtament<note n="‖" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 207, 208,
&amp;c.</note>, which, if conſidered as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule of conduct, (an
intention which it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe) would imply conſequences
dangerous to all the principles of humanity and morality. Matters were here
carried to greater extremity than Elizabeth intended; and being ſatisfied
with ſhewing Mary the diſpoſition of the nation, ſhe ſent to the
houſe her expreſs commands not to deal any farther at preſent in the
affair of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Queen<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 219,

intereſt prevailed in the houſe, than the intemperate uſe of authorities
derived from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially from the Old Teſtament; and the Queen
was ſo little a lover of that ſect, that ſhe was not likely to make any
conceſſion merely in deference to their ſollicitation. She ſhewed this
ſeſſion her diſapprobation of their ſchemes in another remarkable
inſtance. There had paſſed in the lower houſe two bills, for regulating
eccleſiaſtical ceremonies; but ſhe ſent them a like imperious
meſſage <pb n="540" facs="tcp:0429000102:143"/> with the foregoing, and by the terror of her

               <p>BUT tho' Elizabeth would not proceed to ſuch extremities
againſt Mary, as were recommended to her by the Parliament, ſhe was alarmed
with the great intereſt and the reſtleſs ſpirit of that princeſs, as
well as her cloſe connections with Spain; and ſhe thought it neceſſary
both to increaſe the rigour and ſtrictneſs of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and to
follow maxims different from what ſhe had hitherto purſued in her
management of Scotland<note n="*" place="bottom">Digges, p. 152.</note>. 
<note place="margin">Scotch affairs.</note> That kingdom remained
ſtill in a ſtate of anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. The caſtle of Edinburgh, commanded by
Kirkaldy of Grange, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the Queen; and the lords of that party,
encouraged by his countenance, had taken poſſeſſion of the capital, and
carried on a vigorous war againſt the regent. By a ſudden and unexpected
inroad, they ſeized that nobleman at Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but finding that his friends,
ſallying from the caſtle, were likely to relieve him, they inſtantly put
him to death. The earl of Marre was choſen regent in his place; and found the
ſame difficulties to encounter in the government of that divided country. He
was therefore glad to accept of the mediation of the French and Engliſh
ambaſſadors, and to conclude on equal terms a truce with the Queen's
party<note n="†" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 263.</note>. He was a man
of a free and generous ſpirit, and ſcorned to ſubmit to any dependance on
England; and for this reaſon Elizabeth, who had formed cloſe connections
with France, yielded with leſs reluctance to the ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that
court, ſtill maintained the appearance of neutrality between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and allowed matters to remain on a ballance in Scotland<note n="‡" place="bottom">Digges, p. 156, 165, 169.</note>. But affairs ſoon
after took a new turn, Marre died of melancholy, with which the diſtracted
ſtate of the country affected him: Morton was choſen regent; and as this
nobleman had ſecretly taken all his meaſures with Elizabeth, who no longer
relied on the friendſhip of the French court, ſhe reſolved to exert
herſelf more effectually for the ſupport of that party, whom ſhe had
always favoured. She ſent Sir Henry Killigrew ambaſſador into Scotland,
who found Mary's partizans ſo diſcouraged by the diſcovery and
puniſhment of Norfolk's conſpiracy, that they were glad to ſubmit to the
King's authority, and accept of an indemnity for all paſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences<note n="‖" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 268.</note>. The duke of Chatelrault,
and the earl of Huntley, with the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of Mary's friends,
laid down their arms on theſe conditions. The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon alone of the
caſtle of Edinburgh continued refractory. Kirkaldy's fortunes were
deſperate; and he flattered himſelf with aſſiſtance from the Kings of
France and Spain, who encouraged his obſtinacy, in hopes of being able, from
that quarter, to give diſturbance to England. Elizabeth was alarmed with the
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; <pb n="541" facs="tcp:0429000102:144"/> ſhe no more apprehended the coming to
extremity with the Queen of Scots, who, ſhe found, could not any longer be
amuſed by her artifices; ſhe had an entire reliance on Morton; and ſhe
ſaw, that, by the ſubmiſſion of all the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable nobility, the
pacification of Scotland would be an eaſy, as well as a moſt important
undertaking. She, therefore, ordered Sir William Drury, governor of Berwic, to
march with ſome troops and artillery to Edinburgh, and to beſiege the
caſtle<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 449.</note>. The garriſon
ſubmitted at diſcretion; Kirkaldy was delivered to his countrymen, by whom
he was tried and executed: Secretary Lidington, who had taken part with him,
died ſoon after a voluntary death, as is ſuppoſed; and Scotland,
ſubmitting entirely to the regent, gave not, during a long time, any farther

                  <note place="margin">French affairs.</note> THE events which
happened in France, were not ſo agreeable to the Queen's intereſts and
inclinations. The fallacious pacifications which had been ſo often made with
the Hugonots, gave them good reaſon to ſuſpect the preſent intentions
of the court; and after all the other leaders of that party were deceived into
a dangerous credulity, the ſagacious admiral ſtill remained doubtful and
uncertain. But his ſuſpicions were at laſt overcome, partly by the
profound diſſimulation of Charles, partly by his own earneſt deſire to
end the miſeries of France, and return again to the performance of his duty
towards his prince and country. He conſidered beſides, that as the former
violent conduct of the court had ever met with ſuch fatal ſucceſs, it was
not unlikely, that a prince, who had newly come to years of diſcretion, and
was not rivetted in any dangerous animoſities or prejudices, would be induced
to govern himſelf by more moderate maxims. And as Charles was young, was of a
paſſionate haſty temper, and addicted to pleaſure<note n="†" place="bottom">Digges, p. 8, 39.</note>, ſuch deep perfidy ſeemed either
remote from his character, or difficult, and almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be
ſo uniformly ſupported by him. Moved by theſe conſiderations, the
admiral, the Queen of Navarre, and all the Hugonots began to repoſe
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in full ſecurity, and gave credit to the treacherous
careſſes and profeſſions of the French court. Elizabeth herſelf,
notwithſtanding her great experience and penetration, entertained not the
leaſt miſtruſt of Charles's ſincerity; and being pleaſed to find her
enemies of the houſe of Guiſe removed from all authority, and to obſerve
an animoſity every day growing between the French and Spaniſh monarchs, 
<note place="margin">11th April.</note> ſhe concluded a
defenſive league with the former<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p.

Walſingham, her ambaſſador, ſent her over, by every courier, the moſt

                  <pb n="542" facs="tcp:0429000102:145"/> THE better to blind the eyes of the
jealous Hugonots, and draw their leaders into the ſnare prepared for them,
Charles offered his ſiſter, Margaret, in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the prince of
Navarre; and the admiral, with all the conſiderable nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that party,
had come to Paris, in order to aſſiſt at the celebration of theſe
nuptials, which, it was hoped, would finally, if not compoſe the differences,
at leaſt appeaſe the bloody animoſity of the two religions. The Queen of
Navarre was poiſoned by orders from the court; the admiral was dangerouſly
wounded by an aſſaſſin: 
<note place="margin">24 Auguſt.</note> Yet Charles, by redoubling
his diſſimulation, was ſtill able to retain the Hugonots in their
ſecurity: 
<note place="margin">Maſſacre of Paris.</note> Till on the
evening of St. Bartholomew, the day of the marriage, the ſignal was given for
a general maſſacre of theſe religioniſts, and the King himſelf in
perſon led the way to theſe aſſaſſinations. The hatred long
entertained by the Pariſians againſt the proteſtants, made them ſecond,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preparation, the fury of the court; and all conditions, ages and
ſexes, ſuſpected of any propenſity to that religion, were involved in
an undiſtinguiſhed ruin. The admiral, his ſon-in-law Teligni, Soubize,
Rochefoucaut, Pardail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Piles, Lavardin; men, who, during the late wars, had
diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the moſt heroic actions, were miſerably
butchered without reſiſtance; the ſtreets of Paris flowed with blood; and
the populace, more enraged than ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with their cruelty, as if repining
that death had ſaved the victims from far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſult, exerciſed on their
dead bodies all the rage of the moſt licentious bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. About five
hundred gentlemen and men of rank periſhed in this maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre; and near
ten thouſand of inferior condition<note n="*" place="bottom">Davila, lib.
V.</note>. Orders were ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to all the provinces for a like
general execution of the proteſtants; and in Roüen, Lyons, and many
other cities, the people emulated the fury of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. Even the murder of
the King of Navarre, and the prince of Condé, had been propoſed by the
duke of Guiſe; but Charles, ſoftened by the amiable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the King of
Navarre, and hoping that theſe young princes might eaſily be converted to
the catholic faith, was determined to ſpare their lives, tho' he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
them to purchaſe their ſafety by a ſeeming change of their religion.</p>
               <p>CHARLES, in order to cover this barbarous perfidy, pretended,
that a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the Hugonots to ſeize his perſon had been
ſuddenly diſcovered; and that he had been neceſſitated, for his own
defence, to proceed to this ſeverity againſt them. He ſent orders to
Fenelon, his ambaſſador in England, to aſk an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to give
Elizabeth this account of the late tranſaction. That mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who was a
man of probity, abhorred the treachery and cruelty of his court, and even
ſcrupled not to declare, that he was now aſhamed to bear the name of a
Frenchman<note n="†" place="bottom">Digges, p. 247.</note>; yet was he
obliged to obey his orders, and make uſe of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, 
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:0429000102:146"/> which had been preſcribed to him. He met with that
reception from all the courtiers, which, he knew, the conduct of his maſter
had ſo well merited. Nothing could be more awful and affecting than the
ſolemnity of his audience. A melancholy ſorrow ſat on every face:
Silence, as in the dead of night, reigned thro' all the chambers of the royal
apartment: The courtiers and ladies, clad in deep mourning, were ranged on each
ſide, and allowed him to paſs, without affording him one ſalute or
favourable look; till he was admitted to the Queen herſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">Carte, vol. III. p. 522. from Fenelon's Diſpatches.</note>. That
princeſs received him with a more eaſy, if not a more gracious countenance;
and heard his apology, without diſcovering any viſible ſymptoms of
indignation. She told him, that, tho', on the firſt rumour of this dreadful
intelligence, ſhe had been aſtoniſhed, that ſo many brave men and loyal
ſubjects, who reſted ſecure on the faith of their ſovereign, ſhould
have been ſuddenly butchered in ſo barbarous a manner; ſhe had hitherto
ſuſpended her judgment, till farther and more certain information ſhould
be brought her: That the account, which he had given, even if founded on no
miſtake or bad information; tho' it might alleviate, would by no means remove
the blame of the King's counſellors, or juſtify the ſtrange irregularity
of their proceedings: That the ſame force, which without reſiſtance had
maſſacred ſo many defenceleſs men, could eaſily have ſecured their
perſons, and have reſerved them for a trial, and for puniſhment by a
formal ſentence, which would have diſtinguiſhed the innocent from the
guilty: That the admiral in particular, being dangerouſly wounded, and
environed by the guards of the King, on whoſe protection he ſeemed entirely
to rely, had no means of eſcape, and might ſurely, before his death, have
been convicted of the crimes imputed to him: That it was more worthy of a
ſovereign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in his own hands the ſword of juſtice, than to
commit it to bloody mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, who, being the declared and mortal enemies of
the perſons accuſed, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it without mercy and without diſtinction:
That if theſe ſentiments were juſt, even ſuppoſing the conſpiracy
of the proteſtants to be real; how much more, if that crime was nothing but a
calumny of their enemies, invented for their ruin and deſtruction? That if
upon enquiry the innocence of theſe unhappy victims ſhould afterwards
appear, it was the King's duty to turn his vengeance on their enemies and
calumniators, who had thus cruelly abuſed his confidence, had murdered ſo
many of his brave ſubjects, and bad done what in them lay to cover him with
infamy and diſhonour: And that for her part, ſhe ſhould form her judgment
of his intentions by his ſubſequent conduct; and in the mean time 
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:0429000102:147"/> ſhould act as deſired by the ambaſſador, and
rather pity than blame his maſter for the extremities, to which he had been
carried<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Digges, p. 247, 248.</note>.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH was fully ſenſible of the dangerous ſituation in
which ſhe now ſtood. In the maſſacre of Paris, ſhe ſaw the reſult
of that general conſpiracy, which had been formed, for the extermination of
the proteſtants; and ſhe knew, that ſhe herſelf, as the head and
protector of that religion, was expoſed to the utmoſt fury and reſentment
of the catholics. The violences and cruelties of the Spaniards in the Low
Countries were another branch of the ſame conſpiracy; and as Charles and
Philip, two princes nearly allied in perfidy and barbarity, as well as in
bigotry, had now laid aſide their pretended quarrel, and had avowed the
moſt entire friendſhip<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 268, 282.</note>,
ſhe had reaſon, ſo ſoon as they had appeaſed their domeſtic
commotions, to dread the effects of their united councils. The duke of Guiſe
alſo and his family, whom Charles, in order to deceive the admiral, had
hitherto kept at a diſtance, had now acquired an open and entire aſcendant
in the court of France; and ſhe was ſenſible, that theſe princes, from
perſonal as well as political reaſons, were her declared and implacable
enemies. The Queen of Scots, their near relation and cloſe confederate, was
the pretender to her throne; and tho' detained in cuſtody, was actuated by a
reſtleſs ſpirit, and beſides her foreign allies, poſſeſſed very
numerous and zealous partizans in the heart of the kingdom. For theſe
reaſons, Elizabeth thought it more prudent not to break all terms with the
French monarch; but ſtill to liſten to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of
friendſhip, which he made her. She allowed even the negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be
renewed for her marriage with the duke of Alancon, Charles's third brother<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. paſſim. Camden, p. 447.</note>: Thoſe
with the duke of Anjou had already been broke off. She ſent the earl of
Worceſter to aſſiſt in her name at the baptiſm of a young princeſs,
born to Charles; but before ſhe agreed to give this laſt mark of
condeſcenſion, ſhe thought it becoming her dignity, to renew her
expreſſions of blame and even of deteſtation againſt the cruelties
exerciſed on his proteſtant ſubjects<note n="‡" place="bottom">Digges, p. 297, 298. Camden, p. 447.</note>. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, ſhe
prepared herſelf for that attack, which ſeemed to threaten her from the
combined power and violence of the Romaniſts: She fortified Portſmouth, put
her fleet in order, exerciſed her militia, cultivated popularity with her
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, acted with vigour for the farther reduction of Scotland under
obedience to the young King, and renewed her alliance with the German princes,
who were no leſs alarmed than herſelf at theſe treacherous and
ſanguinary meaſures, ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally embraced by the catholics.</p>

cautiouſly avoided the coming to extremities with Charles, the greateſt
ſecurity, which ſhe poſſeſſed againſt his violence, was derived
from the difficulties, which the obſtinate reſiſtance of the hugonots
ſtill created to him.<label type="milestone">

themſelves, with encreaſed forces and redoubled zeal, to return into
France, and revenge the treacherous ſlaughter of their brethren. Thoſe who
lived in the middle of the kingdom, took ſhelter in the neareſt garriſons
occupied by the hugonots; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they could repoſe no faith in
capitulations, and expect no clemency, were determined to defend themſelves
to the laſt extremity. The ſect, which Charles had thought at one blow to
exterminate, had now an army of eighteen thouſand men on foot, and
poſſeſſed in different parts of the kingdom above an hundred cities,
caſtles, or fortreſſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Digges, p. 313.</note>;
nor could that prince deem himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the invaſion threatened
him by all the other proteſtants of Europe. The nobility and gentry of
England were rouzed to ſuch a pitch of reſentment, that they offered to
levy an army of twenty-two thouſand foot and four thouſand horſe, to
tranſport them into France, and to maintain them ſix months at their own
charge: But Elizabeth, who was cautious in her meaſures, and who feared to
inflame the quarrel between the two religions by theſe dangerous croiſades,
refuſed her conſent, and moderated the zeal of her ſubjects<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p 335,

leſs political, or more ſecure from the reſentment of France, forwarded
the levies made by the proteſtants; and the prince of Condé, having
eſcaped from court, put himſelf at the head of theſe troops, and prepared
to enter the kingdom. The duke of Alençon, the King of Navarre, the
family of Montmorenci, and many conſiderable men even among the catholics,
diſpleaſed, either on a private or public account, with the meaſures of
the court, favoured the progreſs of the hugonots; and every thing relapſed
into confuſion. <label type="milestone">

Henry, duke of Anjou, who had, ſome time before, been elected King of Poland,
no <pb n="546" facs="tcp:0429000102:149"/> ſooner heard of his brother's death, than he
haſtened to take poſſeſſion of the crown of France; and found the
kingdom, not only involved in the greateſt preſent diſorders, but
expoſed to infirmities, for which it was extremely difficult to provide any
ſuitable remedy. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1575</label> The people were divided
into two theological factions, furious from their zeal, and mutually enraged
from the injuries which they had committed or received; and as all faith had
been violated and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration baniſhed, it ſeemed impracticable to frame
any terms of compoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Each party had devoted itſelf to
leaders, whoſe commands had more authority than the will of the ſovereign;
and even the catholics, to whom the King was attached, were conducted entirely
by the councils of Guiſe and his family. The religious connexions had, on
both ſides, ſuperceded the civil; or rather (for men will always be guided
by preſent intereſt) two empires being ſecretly formed in the kingdom,
every individual was engaged by new views of intereſt to follow thoſe
leaders, to whom, during the courſe of paſt convulſions, he had been
indebted for his honours and preferment. Henry, obſerving the low condition
of the crown, had laid a ſcheme of reſtoring his own authority, by acting
as umpire between the parties, by moderating their differences, and by reducing
both to a dependance upon himſelf. He poſſeſſed all the talents of
diſſimulation requiſite for the execution of this delicate plan; but
being deficient in vigour, application, and ſound underſtanding, inſtead
of acquiring a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over both factions, he loſt the confidence of
both, and taught the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans of each to adhere more cloſely to their
particular leaders, whom they found more hearty, cordial, and ſincere, in the
cauſe, which they purſued. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1576</label> The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots
were fortified by the acceſſion of a German army under the prince of
Condé and prince Caſimir; but much more, by the credit and perſonal
virtues of the King of Navarre, who, having fled from court, had placed
himſelf at the head of that formidable party. Henry, in proſecution of his
plan, entered into a compoſition with them; and being deſirous of
preſerving a balance between the facts, he granted them peace on the moſt
advantageous conditions. This was the fifth general peace made with the
hugonots; but tho' it was no more ſincere on the part of the court than any
of the former, it gave the higheſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt to the catholics; and
afforded the duke of Guiſe the deſired pretence of declaiming againſt the
meaſures, and maxims, and conduct of the King. That artful and bold leader
took thence an occaſion of reducing his party into a more formed and regular
body; and he laid the firſt foundations of the famous LEAGUE, which, without
any regard to the royal authority, aimed at the entire ſuppreſſion of the
hugonots. Such was the unhappy condition of France, from the paſt
ſeverities and violences of its princes, that toleration could no longer be
admitted; <pb n="547" facs="tcp:0429000102:150"/> and a conceſſion for liberty of
conſcience, which would have probably appeaſed the reformers, excited the
moſt violent reſentment and animoſity in the catholics.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1577</label> Henry, in order to divert the force of the
league from himſelf, and even to clude its efforts againſt the hugonots,
declared himſelf the head of that ſeditious confederacy, and took the field
as leader of the Romaniſts. But his dilatory and feeble meaſures
diſcovered his reluctance to the undertaking; and after ſome
unſucceſsful attempts, he concluded a new peace, which, tho' leſs
favorable than the former to the proteſtants, gave no contentment to the
catholics. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1578</label> Mutual diffidence ſtill
prevailed between the parties; the King's moderation was ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to
both; each faction continued to fortify itſelf againſt that breach, which,
they foreſaw, muſt ſpeedily enſue; theological controverſy daily
whetted the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity of the ſects; and every private injury became the
ground of a public quarrel. The King, hoping, by his artifice and ſubtlety,
to allure the nation into a love of pleaſure and repoſe, was himſelf
caught in the ſnare; and ſinking into diſſoluteneſs and indolence,
wholly loſt the eſteem, and, in a great meaſure, the affections of the
nation. Inſtead of advancing ſuch men of character and ability, as were
neuters between theſe dangerous factions, he gave all his confidence to young
agreeable favourites, who, unable to prop his falling authority, leaned
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon it, and encreaſed the general odium againſt his
adminiſtration. The public burthens, encreaſed by his profuſe liberality,
and feeling more heavy on a diſordered kingdom, became another ground of
complaint; and the uncontrouled animoſity of parties, joined to the
multiplicity of taxes, rendered peace more calamitous than any open ſtate of
foreign or even domeſtic hoſtility. <label type="milestone">

the generality of the nation to devote themſelves without reſerve to the
one or the other of thoſe great leaders.</p>
               <p>THE civil commotions of France were of too great importance to
be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked by the other princes of Europe; and Elizabeth's foreſight and
vigilance, tho' ſomewhat reſtrained by her frugality, led her to take
ſecretly ſome part in them. Beſides employing on all occaſions her good
offices in favour of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots, ſhe had expended no inconſiderable
ſums of money in levying that army of Germans, which the prince of
Condé and prince Caſimir conducted into France<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 452.</note>; and notwithſtanding all her
negotiations with the court, and her profeſſions of amity, ſhe always
conſidered her own intereſts as connected with the proſperity of the
French proteſtants and the depreſſion of the houſe of Guiſe. Philip,
on <pb n="548" facs="tcp:0429000102:151"/> the other hand, had declared himſelf protector of
the league; had entered into the cloſeſt correſpondence with Guiſe; and
had employed all his authority in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the credit of that factious
leader. The ſympathy of religion, which of itſelf begot a connexion of
intereſts, was one conſiderable inducement; but that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch had alſo in

they received great encouragement from the French proteſtants, would, he
hoped, finally deſpair of ſucceſs, after the entire ſuppreſſion of
their friends and confederates.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Civil wars of the Low Countries.</note> THE
ſame political views, which engaged Elizabeth to ſupport the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,
would have led her to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed proteſtants in the
Low Countries; but the mighty power of Philip, the tranquillity of all his
other dominions, and the great force, which he maintained in theſe mutinous
provinces, kept her in awe, and obliged her, notwithſtanding all temptations
and all provocations, to preſerve ſome terms of amity with that monarch.
The Spaniſh ambaſſador remonſtrated with her, that many of the
Flemiſh exiles, who infeſted the ſeas, and preyed on his maſter's
ſubjects, were received into the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of England, and were there
permitted to diſpoſe of their prizes; and by theſe remonſtrances the
Queen found herſelf under a neceſſity of denying them all entrance into
her dominions. But this meaſure proved in the iſſue extremely prejudicial
to the intereſts of Philip. Theſe deſperate exiles, finding no longer any
poſſibility of ſubſiſtance, were forced to attempt the moſt

alarmed with the danger; and ſtopping thoſe bloody executions, which he was
making on the defenceleſs Flemings, he haſtened with his army to
extinguiſh the flame, which, falling on materials ſo well prepared for
combuſtion, ſeemed to menace a general conflagration. His fears ſoon
appeared to be well grounded. The people in the neighbourhood of the Brille,
enraged by that complication of cruelty, oppreſſion, inſolence,
uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perſecution, under which they laboured, flew to arms; and
in a few days almoſt the whole provinces of Holland and Zealand had revolted
from the Spaniards, and had openly declared againſt the tyranny of Alva. This
event happened in the year 1572.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM, prince of Orange, deſcended from a ſovereign family
of great luſtre and antiquity in Germany, inheriting the poſſeſſions
of a ſovereign family in France, had fixed his reſidence in the Low

immenſe riches, as well as of his perſonal virtues, was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
regarded as the greateſt ſubject, who lived in thoſe provinces. He had
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by all regular and dutiful means the progreſs of the Spaniſh
uſurpations; and when Alva conducted his army into the Netherlands, and
aſſumed the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, this prince, well acquainted with the violent
character of the man, and the tyrannical ſpirit of the court of Madrid,
wiſely fled from the danger which threatened him, and retired to his paternal
eſtate and dominions in Germany. He was cited to appear before Alva's
tribunal, was condemned in abſence, was declared a rebel, and his ample
poſſeſſions in the Low Countries were confiſcated. In revenge, he
levied an army of proteſtants in the empire, and made ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to
reſtore the Flemings to liberty; but was ſtill repulſed with loſs by
the vigilance and military conduct of Alva, and by the great bravery as well as
diſcipline, of thoſe veteran Spaniards who ſerved under that general. The
revolt of Holland and Zealand, provinces which the Prince of Orange formerly
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and where he was infinitely beloved, called him anew from his
retreat; and he added conduct, no leſs than ſpirit, to that obſtinate
reſiſtance, which was here made to the Spaniſh dominion. By uniting the
revolted towns into a league, he laid the foundation of that illuſtrious
commonwealth, the offspring of induſtry and liberty, whoſe arms and policy
have made long ſo ſignal a figure in every tranſaction of Europe. He
inflamed the inhabitants by every motive, which religion, reſentment, or love
of freedom could inſpire. Tho' the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent greatneſs of the Spaniſh
monarchy might deprive them of all courage, he ſtill flattered them with the
concurrence of the other provinces, and with aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the
neighbouring ſtates; and he exhorted them, in defence of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
their liberties, their lives, to endure the utmoſt extremities of war. From
this ſpirit proceeded the deſperate defence of Harlem; a defence, which
nothing but the moſt conſuming famine could overcome, and which the
Spaniards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged by the execution of more than two thouſand of the
inhabitants<note n="*" place="bottom">Bentivoglio, lib. 7.</note>. This extreme
ſeverity, inſtead of ſtriking terror into the Hollanders, animated them
by deſpair; and the vigorous reſiſtance made at Alcmaer, where Alva was
finally repulſed, ſhowed them that their inſolent enemies were not wholly
invincible. The duke, finding at laſt the pernicious effects of his violent
councils, ſollicited to be recalled from the government: Medina-celi, who was
appointed his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, refuſed to accept the charge: Requeſens,
commendator of Caſtile, was ſent from Italy to replace Alva; and this
tyrant departed from the Netherlands in 1574; leaving his name in execration to
the inhabitants, and boaſting in his <pb n="550" facs="tcp:0429000102:153"/> turn, that,
during the courſe of five years government, he had delivered above eighteen
thouſand of theſe rebellious heretics into the hands of the
executioner<note n="*" place="bottom">Grotius, lib. 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>REQUESENS, tho' a man of milder diſpoſitions, could not
appeaſe the violent hatred, which the revolted Hollanders had entertained
againſt the Spaniſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the war continued as obſtinate as
ever. In the ſiege of Leyden, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by the Spaniards, the Dutch opened
the dykes and ſluices, in order to drive them from that enterprize; and the
very peaſants were active in ruining their fields by an inundation, rather
than fall again under the hated tyranny of Spain. But notwithſtanding this
repulſe, the governor ſtill purſued the war; and the conteſt ſeemed
too unequal between ſo mighty a monarchy, and two ſmall provinces, however
fortified by nature, and however defended by the deſperate reſolution of
the inhabitants. The prince of Orange, therefore, in 1575, was reſolved to
ſue for foreign aſſiſtance, and to make applications to one or other of
his great neighbours, Henry or Elizabeth. The court of France was not exempt
from that ſpirit of tyranny and perſecution which prevailed with the
Spaniards; and that kingdom, torne by domeſtic diſſenſions, ſeemed
not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, at preſent, either leizure or ability to pay regard to foreign
intereſts. But England, long connected both by commerce and alliance with the
Netherlands, and now more concerned in the fate of the revolted provinces by a
ſympathy in religion, ſeemed naturally intereſted in their defence; and
as Elizabeth had juſtly entertained great jealouſy againſt Philip, and
governed her powerful and opulent kingdom in perfect tranquillity, great hopes
were entertained, that her policy, her ambition, or her generoſity, would
engage her to ſupport them under their preſent calamities. They ſent,
therefore, a ſolemn embaſſy to London, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of St. Aldegonde,
Douza, Nivelle, Buys, and Melſen; and after em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the moſt humble
ſupplications to the Queen, they proferred her the poſſeſſion and
ſovereignty of their provinces, if ſhe would employ her power in their
defence.</p>
               <p>THERE were many ſtrong motives which might impel Elizabeth to
accept ſo liberal an offer. She was apprized of the injuries which Philip had
done her, by his intrigues with the malecontents in England and Ireland<note n="‡" place="bottom">Digges, p. 73.</note>: She was diſpleaſed to
ſee a violent and military government e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ected in her neighbourhood: She foreſaw the danger which ſhe
ſhould incur from a total prevalence of the catholics in the Low Countries:
And the maritime ſituation of thoſe provinces, as well as their command
over the great rivers, was a very inviting circumſtance to a nation like the
Engliſh, who were beginning to cultivate commerce and naval power. But 
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:0429000102:154"/> this princeſs, tho' magnanimous, had never entertained
the ambition of making conqueſts, or gaining new acquiſitions; and the
whole purpoſe of her vigilant and active politics, was to maintain, by the
moſt frugal and cautious expedients, the tranquillity of her own dominions.
An open war with the Spaniſh monarchy was the apparent conſequence of her
accepting the dominion of theſe provinces; and after taking the inhabitants
under her protection, ſhe could never afterwards in honour abandon them, but,
however deſperate their defence might become, ſhe muſt embrace it, even
farther than her convenience or intereſt would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. For theſe
reaſons, ſhe refuſed, in plain terms, the ſovereignty profered her; but
told the ambaſſadors, that, in return for the good-will which the prince of
Orange and the States had ſhewn her, ſhe would endeavour to mediate an
agreement for them, on the moſt reaſonable conditions which could be
obtained<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 453, 454.</note>. She ſent
accordingly Sir Henry Cobham to Philip; and repreſented to him, the danger
which the whole Low Countries, as well as the revolted provinces, would incur,
if France could obtain the leaſt interval from her inteſtine diſorders,
and find leizure to offer her protection to that mutinous and diſcontented
people. Philip ſeemed to take this remonſtrance in good part; but no accord
enſued, and the war continued with the ſame rage and violence as
before.</p>
               <p>IT was an accident that delivered the Hollanders from their
preſent deſperate ſituation. Requeſens, the governor, dying ſuddenly,
the Spaniſh troops, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for want of pay, and licentious for want
of a proper authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, broke out into a furious mutiny; and
threw every thing into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They ſacked and pillaged the cities of
Maeſtricht and Antwerp, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted great ſlaughter on the inhabitants:
They threatned all the other cities with a like fate: And the whole provinces,
excepting Luxembourg, united for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual defence againſt their violence, and
called in the prince of Orange and the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, as their protectors. A
treaty, commonly called the Pacification of Ghent, was formed by common
agreement; where the removal of foreign troops, and the reſtoration of their
ancient liberties, were the objects which the provinces ſtipulated to
purſue. Don John of Auſtria, natural brother to Philip, being appointed
governor, found, on his arrival at Luxembourg, that the States had ſo
fortified themſelves, and that the Spaniſh troops were ſo divided by
their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there was no poſſibility of reſiſtance; and he
agreed to the terms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him. The Spaniards were recalled; and theſe
provinces ſeemed at laſt to breathe a little from their calamities.</p>
               <p>BUT it was not eaſy for an entire peace to be ſettled, while
the thirſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and dominion governed the King of Spain, and while the
Flemings were ſo <pb n="552" facs="tcp:0429000102:155"/> ſtrongly agitated with reſentment
of paſt, and fear of future injuries. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Don John, who coveted
this great theatre for his military talents, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him rather to enflame
than appeaſe the quarrel; and as he found the States determined to impoſe
very ſtrict limitations on his authority, he broke all arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſeized
Namur, and procured the recall of the Spaniſh army from Italy. This prince,
endowed with a lofty genius, and animated by the proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
of his youth, had opened his mind to vaſt undertakings; and looking much
beyond the conqueſt of the revolted provinces, had projected to marry the
Queen of Scots, and to acquire in her right the dominion of the Britiſh
kingdoms<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 466. Grotius, lib. iii.</note>.
Elizabeth was aware of his intentions; and ſeeing now, from the union of all
the provinces, a fair proſpect of making a long and vigorous defence
againſt Spain, ſhe no longer ſcrupled to embrace the protection of their
liberties, which ſeemed to be ſo intimately connected with her own
ſafety. After ſending them over a ſum of money, about twenty thouſand
pounds, for the immediate pay of their troops, ſhe concluded a treaty with
them; in which ſhe ſtipulated to aſſiſt them with five thouſand
foot and a thouſand horſe, at the charge of the Flemings; and to lend them
a hundred thouſand pounds, on receiving the bonds of ſome of the moſt
conſiderable towns of the Netherlands, for her re-payment within the year. It
was farther agreed, that the commander of the Engliſh army, ſhould be
admitted into the council of the States; and nothing be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined concerning
war or peace, without previouſly informing the Queen or him of it; that they
ſhould enter into no league without her conſent; that if any diſcord
aroſe among themſelves, it ſhould be referred to her arbitration; and
that, if any prince, on any pretext, ſhould attempt hoſtilities againſt
her, they ſhould ſend to her aſſiſtance an army equal to that which
ſhe employed in their defence. This alliance was ſigned on the 7th of
January, 1578<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 466<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>. One
conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to the Queen for entering into treaty with the
States, was to prevent their throwing themſelves into the arms of France; and
ſhe was deſirous to make the King of Spain believe, that it was her ſole
motive. She repreſented to him, by her ambaſſador, Thomas Wilkes, that
ſhe had hitherto acted religiouſly the part of a good neighbour and ally;
had refuſed the ſovereignty of Holland and Zealand, when profered her; had
counſelled the prince of Orange to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the King; and had even
accompanied her advice with menaces, in caſe of his refuſal. She
perſevered, ſhe ſaid, in the ſame friendly intentions; and, as a proof
of it, would venture to interpoſe with her advice for the compoſure of the
preſent differences: Let Don John, whom ſhe could not but regard as her
mortal enemy, be recalled; let ſome other prince more popular be
ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in his place; let the Spaniſh armies be withdrawn; let the
Flemings <pb n="553" facs="tcp:0429000102:156"/> be reſtored to their ancient liberties and
privileges: And if, after theſe conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are ſtill
obſtinate not to return to their duty, ſhe promiſed to join her arms to
thoſe of the King of Spain, and force them to a compliance. Philip
diſſembled his reſentment againſt the Queen; and ſtill continued to
ſupply Don John with money and troops. That prince, tho' once repulſed at
Rimenant, by the valour of the Engliſh under Norris, and tho' oppoſed, as
well by the army of the States as by prince Caſimir, who had conducted to the
Low Countries a great body of Germans, paid by the Queen, gained a great
advantage over the Flemings at Cemblours; but was cut off in the midſt of his
proſperity by poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, given him ſecretly, as was ſuſpected, by
orders from Philip, who dreaded his ambition. The prince of Parma ſucceeded
to the command, who uniting va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and clemency, negociation and military
exploits, made great progreſs againſt the revolted Flemings, and advanced
the progreſs of the Spaniards by his arts as well as by his arms.</p>
               <p>DURING theſe years, while Europe was almoſt every where in
great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, England enjoyed a profound tranquillity; owing chiefly to the
prudence and vigour of the Queen's adminiſtration, and to the wiſe
precautions which ſhe employed in all her meaſures. By ſupporting the
zealous proteſtants in Scotland, ſhe had twice given them the ſuperiority
over their antagoniſts, had connected their intereſts cloſely with her
own, and had procured herſelf entire ſecurity from that quarter, whence the
moſt dangerous invaſions could be made upon her. She ſaw in France her
enemies, the Guiſes, tho' extremely powerful, yet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballanced by the
Hugonots, her zealous partizans; and even hated by the King, who was jealous of
their reſtleſs and exorbitant ambition. The bigotry of Philip gave her
juſt ground of anxiety; but the ſame bigotry had happily excited the moſt
obſtinate oppoſition among his own ſubjects, and had created him enemies,
which his arms and policy were not likely ſoon to overcome. The Queen of
Scots, her antagoniſt and rival, and the pretender to her throne, was a
priſoner in her hands; and by her impatience and high ſpirit had been
engaged in practices which afforded the Queen a pretence for rendring her
confinement more rigorous, and for cutting off her communication with her
partizans in England. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was the capital point, on which depended all
the political tranſactions of that age; and the Queen's conduct in this
particular, making allowance for the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prejudices of the age, could
ſcarcely be accuſed of ſeverity or imprudence. She eſtabliſhed no
inquiſition into men's boſoms; ſhe impoſed no oaths of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
except on thoſe who received truſt or emolument from the public: And tho'
the exerciſe of all religion but the eſtabliſhed was prohibited, the
violation of this law, by the ſaying maſs, and receiving the ſacrament,
in private houſes, <pb n="554" facs="tcp:0429000102:157"/> was, in many inſtances, connived
at<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 459.</note>; while, at the ſame time,
the catholics, in the beginning of her reign, ſhewed little reluctance
againſt going to church, or frequenting the ordinary duties of public
worſhip. The pope, ſenſible that this practice would by degrees reconcile
all his partizans to the reformed religion, haſtened the publication of the
bull, excommunicating the Queen, and freeing her ſubjects from all oaths of
allegiance; and great pains were taken by the emiſſaries of Rome, to render
the breach between the two religions as wide as poſſible, and to make the
frequenting proteſtant churches appear highly criminal to the catholics<note n="†" place="bottom">Walſingham's Letter in Burnet, vol. II. 418.
Cabbala, p. 406.</note>. Theſe practices, with the rebellions which enſued,
increaſed the vigilance and ſeverity of the government; but the
Romaniſts, if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was compared with that of the Nonconformiſts
in other countries, and with their own practices where they domineered, could
not juſtly complain much of violence or perſecution. The Queen appeared
rather more anxious to keep a ſtrict hand over the puritans; who, tho' their
pretenſions were not ſo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous to her authority, ſeemed
to be actuated by a more unreaſonable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, and to retain claims, of
which, both in civil and eccleſiaſtical matters, it was, as yet, difficult
to diſcern the full ſcope and intention. Some ſecret at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of that
ſect to eſtabliſh a ſeparate congregation and diſcipline, had been
carefully repreſſed in the beginning of this reign<note n="‡" place="bottom">Strype's Life of Parker, p. 342. Ibid. Life of Grindal, p.
315.</note>; and when any of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed clergy diſcovered a
tendency to their principles, by omitting the legal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits or ceremonies, the
Queen had ſhewn a determined reſolution to puniſh them by fines and
deprivations<note n="‖" place="bottom">Heylin, p. 165, 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

purpoſe had, by the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which theſe ſectaries received from
ſome of the moſt conſiderable courtiers, been frequently eluded. But what
chiefly tended to gain Elizabeth the hearts of her ſubjects, was, her
frugality, which, tho' carried ſometimes to an extreme, led her not to
amaſs treaſures, but only to prevent impoſitions upon the people, who
were at that time very little accuſtomed to bear the burthens of government.
By means of her rigid oeconomy, ſhe paid all the debts which ſhe found on
the crown, with their full intereſt; tho' ſome of theſe debts had been
contracted even during the reign of her father<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 245. Camden, p. 446.</note>. She repaid ſome loans,
which ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted at the commencement of her reign; a practice in that
age ſomewhat unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual<note n="§" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 246.</note>:
And ſhe eſtabliſhed her credit on ſuch a footing, that no ſovereign

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> THE moſt memorable
event in this period was a ſeſſion of Parliament, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned on the 8th
of February, 1576, where debates were ſtarted, which may appear ſomewhat
curious and ſingular. Peter Wentworth, a puritan, who had ſignalized
himſelf former Parliaments, by his free and undaunted ſpirit, opened this
ſeſſion with a premeditated harangue, which drew on him the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the houſe, and gave great offence to the Queen and the courtiers. As it
ſeems to contain the firſt rude ſketch of thoſe principles of liberty
which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily gained afterwards the aſcendant in England, it may not be
improper to give, in a few words, the ſubſtance of it. He premiſed, that
the very name of liberty is ſweet; but the thing itſelf is precious beyond
the moſt ineſtimable treaſure: And that it behoved them to be careful,
leſt, contenting themſelves with the ſweetneſs of the name, they forego
the ſubſtance, and abandon what of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſions was of
the higheſt value to the kingdom. He then proceeded to obſerve, that
freedom of ſpeech in that houſe, a privilege ſo uſeful both to
ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and ſubject, had been formerly infringed in many eſſential
articles, and was, at preſent, expoſed to the moſt imminent danger: That
it was uſual, when any ſubject of importance was handled, eſpecially if
it regarded religion, to ſurmize, that theſe topics were diſagreeable to
the Queen, and that the farther proceeding in them would draw down her
indignation upon their temerity: That Solomon had juſtly affirmed, the King's
diſpleaſure to be a meſſenger of death; and it was no wonder that men,
even tho' urged by motives of conſcience and duty, ſhould be inclined to
ſtop ſhort, when they found themſelves expoſed to ſo ſevere a
penalty: That by employing this argument, the houſe was incapacitated from
ſerving their country, or even from ſerving the Queen herſelf; whoſe
ears, beſieged by perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious flatterers, were thereby rendered
inacceſſible to the moſt ſalutary truths: That it was a mockery to call
an aſſembly a Parliament, and yet deny them that privilege, which was ſo
eſſential to their being, and without which they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into an
abject ſchool of ſervitude and diſſimulation: That as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was the great guardian of the laws, they ought to have liberty to diſcharge
their truſt, and to maintain that authority whence even Kings themſelves
derive their being: That a King was conſtituted ſuch by law, and tho' he
was not dependant on man, yet was he ſubordinate to God and the law, and was
obliged to make their preſcriptions, not his own will, the rule of his
conduct: That even his commiſſion, as God's vicegerent, enforced, inſtead
of looſening, this obligation; ſince he was thereby inveſted with
authority to execute on earth the will of God, <pb n="556" facs="tcp:0429000102:159"/> which is
nothing but law and juſtice: That tho' theſe ſurmizes of diſpleaſing
the Queen by their proceedings, had impeached, in a very eſſential point,
all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpeech, a privilege granted them by a ſpecial law; yet was
there a more expreſs and more dangerous invaſion made on their liberties,
by frequent meſſages from the throne: That it had become a practice, when
the houſe were entering on any queſtion, either eccleſiaſtical or
civil, to bring an order from the Queen, prohibiting them abſolutely to treat
of ſuch matters, and barring them all farther diſcuſſion of theſe
momentuous articles: That the prelates, emboldened by her royal protection, had
aſſumed a deciſive power in all queſtions of religion, and required
that every one ſhould implicitly ſubmit his faith to their arbitrary
deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: That the love which he bore his ſovereign, forbad him to be
ſilent under ſuch abuſes, or to ſacrifice, on this important
occaſion, his duty to ſervile flattery and complaiſance: And that, as no
earthly creature was exempt from fault, ſo neither was the Queen herſelf;
but in impoſing this ſervitude on her faithful commons, had committed a
great, and even dangerous, fault againſt herſelf and the whole realm<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 236, 237, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT is eaſy to obſerve, from this ſpeech, that in theſe
firſt dawnings of liberty, the parliamentary ſtile was ſtill crude and
unformed; and that the proper deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum of attacking miniſters and
counſellors, without intereſting the honour of the crown, or mentioning the
perſon of the ſovereign, was not as yet entirely eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. The
commons expreſſed great diſpleaſure at this unuſual licence: They
ſequeſtered Wentworth from the houſe, and committed him priſoner to the
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at arms. They even ordered him to be examined by a committee,
conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all thoſe members who were alſo members of the
privy-council, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be made next day to the houſe. This committee
met in the Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and wearing the aſpect of that arbitrary court,
ſummoned Wentworth to appear before them, and anſwer for his behaviour. But
tho' the commons had diſcovered ſo little delicacy or precaution, in thus
confounding their own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with that of the Star-chamber; Wentworth
underſtood better the principles of liberty, and refuſed to give theſe
counſellors any account of his conduct in Parliament, till he was ſatisfied
that they acted not as members of the privy-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but as a committee of the
houſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 241.</note>. He juſtified
himſelf by pleading the rigour and hardſhip of the Queen's meſſages;
and notwithſtanding that the committee ſhewed him, by inſtances in other
reigns, that the practice of ſending ſuch meſſages was not
unprecedented, he would not agree to expreſs any ſorrow or repentance. The
iſſue of the affair was, that, after a month's confinement, the Queen
ſent to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, informing them, that, from her ſpecial grace and
favour, ſhe had reſtored him <pb n="557" facs="tcp:0429000102:160"/> to his liberty and to
his place in the houſe<note n="§" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 244.</note>.
By this ſeeming lenity, ſhe indirectly retained the power which ſhe had
aſſumed, of impriſoning the members, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to anſwer
before her for their conduct in Parliament. And Sir Walter Mildmay endeavoured
to make the houſe ſenſible of her Majeſty's goodneſs, in ſo gently
remitting the indignation which ſhe might juſtly conceive at the teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their member: But he informed them, that they had not the liberty of
ſpeaking what and of whom they pleaſed; and that indiſcreet freedoms
uſed in that houſe, had, both in the preſent and foregoing ages, met with
a proper pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. He warned them, therefore, not to abuſe farther the
Queen's cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency; leſt ſhe be conſtrained, contrary to her inclination,
to turn an unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lenity into a neceſſary ſeverity<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 259.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE behaviour of the two houſes was, in other reſpects,
equally tame and ſubmiſſive. Inſtead of a bill, which was at firſt
introduced<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 252.</note>, for the
reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church, they were contented to preſent a petition to her
majeſty for that purpoſe: And when ſhe told them, that ſhe would give
orders to her bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to amend all abuſes, and if they were negligent,
ſhe would herſelf, by her ſupreme power and authority over the church,
give ſuch redreſs as would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſatisfy the nation; the Parliament
willingly acquieſced in this ſovereign and peremptory deciſion<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 257.</note>.</p>
               <p>THO' the commons ſhewed ſo little ſpirit in oppoſing the
authority of the crown, they maintained, this ſeſſion, their dignity
againſt an incroachment of the lords, and would not agree to a conference
which, they thought, was deſired of them in an irregular manner. They
acknowleged, however, with all humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (ſuch was their expreſſion)
the ſuperiority of the lords: They only refuſed to give that houſe any
reaſon for their proceedings; and aſſerted, that where they altered a
bill ſent them by the peers, it belonged to them to deſire a conference,
not to the upper houſe to require it<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p.
263.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE commons granted an aid of one ſubſidy and two
fifteenths. Mildmay, in order to ſatisfy the houſe concerning the
reaſonableneſs of this grant, entered into a detail of the Queen's paſt
expences in ſupporting the government, and of the increaſing charges of the

               <p>THE greateſt and moſt abſolute ſecurity which Elizabeth
enjoyed during her whole reign, never exempted her from vigilance and
attention; but the ſcene began now to be more overcaſt, and danger
gradually multiplied on her from more than one quarter.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Scotch affairs.</note> THE earl of Morton had
hitherto retained Scotland in ſtrict alliance with the Queen, and had alſo
reſtored domeſtic tranquillity: But it was not likely, that the factitious
and legal authority of a regent would long maintain itſelf in a country
unacquainted with law and order; where even the natural dominion of hereditary
princes ſo often met with oppoſition and controul. The nobility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan anew
to break into factions: The people were diſguſted with ſome inſtances
which appeared of Morton's avarice: And the clergy, who complained of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
innovations on their narrow revenue, joined and increaſed the diſcontent of
the other orders. The regent was ſenſible of his dangerous ſituation; and
hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dropt ſome peeviſh expreſſions, as if he were willing or
deſirous to reſign the government, the noblemen of the oppoſite party,
favourites of the young King, laid hold of this conceſſion, and required
that demiſſion which he ſeemed ſo frankly to offer them. James was at
this time but eleven years of age; yet Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, having ſecured himſelf, as
he imagined, by a general pardon, reſigned his authority into the hands of
the King, who pretended to conduct, in his own name, the adminiſtration of
the kingdom. The regent retired from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſeemed to employ
himſelf entirely in the care of his domeſtic affairs; but either tired with
this tranquillity, which appeared inſipid after the agitations of ambition,
or thinking it time to throw off diſſimulation, he returned again to court,
acquired an aſcendant in the council; and tho' he reſumed not the title of
regent, governed with the ſame authority as before. The oppoſite party,
after holding ſeparate conventions, took to arms, under pretence of
delivering their <pb n="559" facs="tcp:0429000102:162"/>

prince from captivity, and reſtoring him to the free exerciſe of his
government: Queen Elizabeth interpoſed by her ambaſſador, Sir Robert
Bowes, and mediated an agreement between the factions: Morton kept
poſſeſſion of the government; but his enemies were numerous and
vigilant, and his authority ſeemed to become every day more precarious.</p>
               <p>THE count d'Aubigney, of the houſe of Lenox, couſin-german
to the King's father, had been born and educated in France; and being a young
nobleman of a good addreſs, and a ſweet diſpoſition, he appeared to the
duke of Guiſe a very proper inſtrument for detaching James from the
Engliſh intereſt, and connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with his mother and her relations. He
no ſooner appeared at Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, where James reſided, than he acquired the
affections of the young monarch; and joining his intereſts with James Stuart
of the houſe of Ochiltree, a young man of profligate manners, who had
acquired the King's favour, he employed himſelf, under the appearance of play
and amuſement, in inſtilling into the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mind of the prince, new
ſentiments of politics and government. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him the
injuſtice which had been done Mary in her depoſition, and made him
entertain thoughts, either of reſigning the crown into her hands, or of
aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating her with him in the adminiſtration<note n="*" place="bottom">Digges, p. 412, 423. Melvil, p. 130.</note>. Elizabeth, alarmed
with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which might enſue from the prevalence of this intereſt in
Scotland, ſent anew Sir Robert Bowes to Stirling; and accuſing Aubigney,
now created earl of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox, of an attachment to the French; warned James
againſt entertaining ſuch ſuſpicious and dangerous connections<note n="†" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 309.</note>. The King excuſed
himſelf, by Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hume his ambaſſador; and Lenox, finding that the
Queen had openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt him, was farther confirmed in his
intention of overturning the Engliſh intereſt, and particularly of ruining
Morton, who was regarded as the head of it. That nobleman was arreſted in
council, accuſed as an accomplice in the late King's murder, committed to
priſon, brought to trial, and condemned to ſuffer as a traitor. He
confeſſed, that Bothwel had communicated to him the deſign, had pleaded
Mary's aſſent, and had deſired his concurrence; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that he
had ever given his approbation to that crime; and in excuſe for his
concealment, alledged the danger of revealing it, either to Henry, who had no
reſolution nor conſtancy, or to Mary, who appeared to be an accomplice in
the murder<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 31<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sir Thomas Randolph was ſent by the Queen to intercede in favour of Morton;
and that ambaſſador, not content with diſcharging this duty of his

protecting, even by force of arms, the life of the priſoner. The more to
overawe that nobleman's enemies, Elizabeth ordered forces to be aſſembled
on the borders of England; but this expedient ſerved only to haſten his
ſentence and execution<note n="‖" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p.
312.</note>. Morton died with that conſtancy and reſolution which had
attended him thro' all the various events of his life; and left a reputation,
which was leſs diſputed with regard to ability than probity and virtue. But
this concluſion of the ſcene happened not till the ſubſequent year.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Spaniſh affairs.</note> ELIZABETH was at
this time extremely anxious on account of every revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scotland;
becauſe that country alone, not being ſeparated from England by ſea, and
bordering on all the catholic and malecontent counties, afforded her enemies a
ſafe and eaſy method of attacking her; and becauſe ſhe was
ſenſible, that Mary, thinking herſelf abandoned by the French monarch,
had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by the Guiſes to have recourſe to the powerful protection
of Philip, who, tho' he had not yet come to an open rupture with the Queen, was
every day, both by the injuries which he committed and received, more
exaſperated againſt her. That he might retaliate for the aſſiſtance
which ſhe gave to his rebels in the Low Countries, he had ſent under the
name of the pope<note n="*" place="bottom">Digges, p. 359, 370.</note>, a body of
ſeven hundred Spaniards and Italians into Ireland; where the inhabitants,
always turbulent, and diſcontented with the Engliſh government, were now
more alienated by religious prejudices, and were ready to join every invader.
The Spaniſh general, San Joſepho, built a fort in Kerry; and being there
beſieged by the earl of Ormond, preſident of Munſter, who was ſoon
after joined by lord Gray, the deputy, he made a very weak and cowardly
reſiſtance. After ſome aſſaults, feebly ſuſtained, he
ſurrendered at diſcretion; and Gray, who was attended with a very ſmall
force, finding himſelf embarraſſed with ſo many priſoners, put all
the Spaniards and Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the ſword without mercy, and hanged about
fifteen hundred Iriſh: A cruelty which gave great diſpleaſure to

the county of Devon, having acquired conſiderable riches by ſome
depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made on the Spaniards in the iſthmus of Panama, and having
there got a ſight of the Pacific ocean, was ſo ſtimulated by ambition and

Indies, and returned ſafely this year by the Cape of Good Hope. He was the
firſt Eng iſhman who compaſſed the Globe; and the firſt commander in
chief: For Magellan, whoſe ſhip executed the ſame adventure, died in his
paſſage. His name became very celebrated on account of ſo bold and
fortunate an attempt; but many, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the reſentment of the
Spaniards, endeavoured to perſuade the Queen, that it would be more prudent
to diſown the enterprize, to puniſh Drake, and to reſtore the treaſure.
But Elizabeth, who admired valour, and who was allured by the proſpect of
ſharing in the riches, was determined to countenance that gallant ſailor:
She conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and accepted of a banquet from
him at Deptford, on board the ſhip which had atchieved ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable a
voyage. When Philip's ambaſſador, Mendoza, exclaimed againſt Drake's
pyracies, ſhe told him, that the Spaniards, by arrogating a right to the
whole new world, and excluding thence all other European nations, who ſhould
ſail thither, even with a view of exerciſing the moſt lawful commerce,
very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tempted others to make a violent irruption into theſe
countries<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p. 480.</note>. To pacify,
however, the Spaniſh monarch, ſhe cauſed part of the booty to be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to Pedro Sebura, a Spaniard, who pretended to be agent for the
merchants, whom Drake had ſpoiled. <label type="milestone">

learned afterwards, that Philip had ſeized the money, and had employed part
of it againſt herſelf in Ireland, part of it in the pay of the prince of
Parma's troops, ſhe was determined to make no more reſtitutions.</p>
               <p>THERE was another cauſe, which induced the Queen to take this
reſolution: She was in ſuch want of money, that ſhe was obliged to
aſſemble a Parliament; a meaſure, which, as ſhe herſelf openly

granting her a ſupply of one ſubſidy and two fifteens, enacted ſome
ſtatutes for the ſecurity of the government, chiefly againſt the attempts
of the catholics. Whoever, in any way, reconciled any one to the church of
Rome, or was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reconciled, was declared to be guilty of treaſon: To

or ſeditious words againſt the Queen was puniſhable, for the firſt
offence, with the pillory and loſs of ears; the ſecond offence was declared
felony: The writing or printing ſuch words was felony even on the firſt
offence<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. c. 2.</note>. The puritans
prevailed to have farther application made for reformation in religion<note n="‡" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 302.</note>. Paul Wentworth, brother to
the member of that name, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeſſion, moved, that the commons, from their own authority, ſhould
appoint a general faſt and prayers; and the commons raſhly aſſented to
his motion. For this preſumption, they were ſeverely reprimanded by a
meſſage from the Queen, as encroaching on the royal prerogative and
ſupremacy; and they were obliged to ſubmit, and aſk forgiveneſs<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 284, 285.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Queen and Parliament were engaged to paſs theſe ſevere
laws againſt the catholics, by ſome late diſcoveries, which had been made
of the treaſonable practices of the Romiſh prieſts. When the worſhip of
the catholics was ſuppreſſed, and the reformation introduced into the
univerſities, the King of Spain reflected, that as ſome ſpecies of
literature was requiſite for the ſupport of theſe doctrines and
controverſies, the Romiſh communion muſt totally decay in England, if no
means were found to give erudition to the eccleſiaſtics; and for this
reaſon, he founded a ſeminary at Doüay, where the catholics ſent
their children, chiefly thoſe intended for the prieſthood, in order to
receive the rudiments of their education. The cardinal of Lorraine imitated
this example by erecting a like ſeminary in his dioceſe of Rheims; and tho'
Rome was ſomewhat diſtant, the pope would not neglect to adorn, with a
foundation of the ſame nature, that capital of orthodoxy. Theſe
ſeminaries, founded with this hoſtile intention, ſent over every year a
colony of prieſts, who maintained the catholic ſuperſtition in the full
height of its bigotry; and being educated with a view to the crown of
martyrdom, were not deterred, either by danger or fatigue, from maintaining and
propagating their principles. They infuſed into all their votaries an extreme
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:0429000102:168"/> hatred againſt the Queen; whom they treated as an
uſurper, a ſchiſmatic, a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic, a perſecutor of the orthodox, and
one ſolemnly and publickly anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the holy father. Sedition,
rebellion, and even ſometimes aſſaſſination, were the expedients, by
which they propoſed to effectuate their purpoſes againſt her; and the
ſevere reſtraint, not to ſay perſecution, under which the catholics
laboured, made them the more willingly receive, from their ghoſtly fathers,
ſuch violent doctrines.</p>
               <p>THESE ſeminaries were all of them under the direction of the
jeſuits, a new order of regular prieſts erected in Europe; when the court
of Rome perceived, that the lazy monks and beggarly friars, who ſufficed in
times of ignorance, were no longer able to defend the ramparts of the church,
aſſailed on every ſide, and that the inquiſitive ſpirit of the age
required a ſociety more active and more learned, to oppoſe its dangerous
progreſs. Theſe men, as they ſtood foremoſt in the conteſt againſt
the proteſtants, drew on them the extreme animoſity of that whole ſect;
and by aſſuming a ſuperiority over the other more numerous and more
antient orders of their own communion, were even expoſed to the envy of their
brethren: So that it was no wonder, if the blame to which their principles and
conduct might be expoſed, has, in many inſtances, been much exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated.
This reproach, however, they muſt bear from poſterity, that, by the very
nature of their inſtitution, they were engaged to pervert learning, the only
effectual remedy againſt ſuperſtition, into a nouriſhment of that
infirmity; and as their eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was chiefly of the eccleſiaſtical and
ſcholaſtic kind (tho' a few members have cultivated polite literature) they
were only the more enabled, by that acquiſition, to refine away the
plaineſt dictates of morality, and to erect a regular ſyſtem of
caſuiſtry, by which prevarication, perjury, and every crime, where it
ſerved their ghoſtly purpoſes, might be juſtified and defended.</p>
               <p>THE jeſuits, as devoted ſervants to the court of Rome,
exalted the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the ſovereign pontiff above all earthly power;
and by maintaining his authority of depoſing Kings, ſet no bounds, either
to his ſpiritual or temporal juriſdiction. This doctrine became ſo
prevalent among the zealous catholics in England, that the excommunication,
fulminated againſt Elizabeth, excited many ſcruples of a ſingular kind,
to which it behoved the holy father to provide a remedy. The bull of Pius, in
abſolving the ſubjects from their oaths of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, required them to
reſiſt the Queen's uſurpation; and many Romaniſts were apprehenſive,
that, by this clauſe, they were obliged in conſcience, even tho' no
favourable opportunity offered, to rebel againſt her, and that no dangers nor
difficulties could free them from this indiſpenſible duty. But Parſons
and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian, two jeſuits, were ſent over with a mitigation and explanation
of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; <pb n="564" facs="tcp:0429000102:169"/> and they taught their votaries, that,
tho' the bull was for ever binding on Elizabeth and her partizans, it did not
oblige the catholics to obedience, except when the ſovereign pontiff ſhould
think proper, by a new ſummons, to require it<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden,
p. 477.</note>. Campian was afterwards detected in treaſonable practices; and
being put to the rack, and confeſſing his guilt, he was publicly executed.
His execution was ordered at the very time, when the duke of Anjou was in
England, and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with the greateſt appearance of ſucceſs his
marriage with the Queen; and this ſeverity was probably intended to appeaſe
her proteſtant ſubjects, and to ſatisfy them, that, whatever meaſures
ſhe might purſue, ſhe never would depart from the principles of the
reformation.</p>
               <p>WHILE hoſtilities were daily multiplying between Spain and
England, and while Elizabeth knew, that Philip, from reſentment, from
bigotry, and from intereſt, was ſtrongly, tho' ſecretly, induced to
effect her ruin, ſhe ſaw the neceſſity of ſecuring herſelf
againſt the efforts of ſo powerful and political a monarch. The obſtinate
reſiſtance of the ſtates in the Netherlands gave her hopes, that his
force and treaſure would be waſted in ſubduing theſe provinces; but the
admirable conduct and rapid progreſs of the prince of Parma ſtruck her with
apprehenſions; and as the acquiſition, which Philip, about this time, made
of Portugal, brought him a great acceſſion of riches and naval power, the
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of ſeeking the protection of ſome powerful alliance became
every day the more apparent. The animoſity, which ſtill encreaſed between
the French mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch and the duke of Guiſe, and the confederacy, which the
latter prince had ſecretly formed with Philip, opened the proſpect of a
cloſe alliance between the ſovereigns of France and England; and the
general apprehenſions, entertained by all Europe of the Spaniſh power,
ſeemed to require ſome general union for reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its farther
progreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Negotiations of marriage with the duke of
Anjou.</note> THE duke of Alençon, now created duke of Anjou, had never
entirely dropped his pretenſions to eſpouſe Elizabeth; and that
princeſs, tho' her ſuitor was near twenty-five years younger than
herſelf, and had no knowlege of her perſon but by pictures or
deſcriptions, was ſtill pleaſed with the counterfeit image, which his
addreſſes afforded her of love and tenderneſs. The duke, in order to
forward his ſuit, beſides employing his brother's ambaſſadors, ſent
over Simier, an agent of his own; an artful man, of an agreeable
converſation, who, ſoon remarking the Queen's humour, amuſed her with gay
diſcourſe, and inſtead of ſerious political reaſonings, which, he
found, only awakened her ambition, and hurt his maſter's intereſts,
introduced every moment all the topics of paſſion and <pb n="565" facs="tcp:0429000102:170"/> of gallantry. The pleaſure, which ſhe found in this man's
ſociety, ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a great familiarity between them; and amidſt the
greateſt hurry of buſineſs, her wiſeſt miniſters had not ſuch
ready acceſs to her perſon, as had Simier, who, under pretence of
negotiation, entertained her with accounts of the tender attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment borne her
by the duke of Anjou. The earl of Leiceſter, who had never before been
alarmed with any courtſhip made to her, and who always truſted that her
love of dominion would prevail over her inclination to marriage, began to
apprehend, that ſhe was at laſt caught in her own ſnare, and that the
artful encouragement, which ſhe had given to this young ſuitor, had
unawares engaged her affections. To render Simier odious, he availed himſelf
of the credulity of the times, and ſpread reports, that that miniſter had
gained an aſcendant over the Queen, not by any natural principles of her
conſtitution, but by incantations and love poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Simier, in revenge,
endeavoured to diſcredit Leiceſter, and revealed to her a ſecret, which
none of her courtiers dared to diſcover, that this nobleman was ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without her conſent, married to the widow of the earl of Eſſex; an
action, which the Queen interpreted either to proceed from want of reſpect to
her, or as a violation of their mutual attachment; and which ſo provoked her,
that ſhe threatened to ſend him priſoner to the Tower<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 471.</note>. The quarrel went ſo far between
Leiceſter and the French agent, that the former was ſuſpected of having
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed one Tudor, a bravo, to take away the life of his enemy; and the Queen
thought it neceſſary, by proclamation, to put Simier under her own
protection. It happened, that while the Queen was rowed in her barge on the
Thames, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Simier, and ſome of her courtiers, a ſhot was fired
which wounded one of her bargemen; but Elizabeth finding, upon enquiry, that
the piece had been diſcharged by accident, gave the perſon his liberty,
without farther puniſhment. So far was ſhe from entertaining any ſuſpic

noblemen; and as the Queen had in a manner the power of preſcribing what
terms ſhe pleaſed, the articles were ſoon ſettled with the Engliſh
commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners. It was agreed, that the marriage ſhould be celebrated
within ſix weeks after the ratification of the articles; that the duke and
his retinue ſhould have the exerciſe of their religion; that after the
marriage he ſhould bear the title of King, exerciſe of their religion; that
after the marriage he ſhould bear the title of King, but the adminiſtration
ſhould remain ſolely in the Queen; that their children, male or female,
ſhould ſucceed to the crown of England; that if there be two males, the
eldeſt, in caſe of Henry's death without iſſue, ſhould be King of
France, the younger of England; that if there be but one male, and he ſucceed
to the crown of France, he ſhould be obliged to reſide in England eight
months every two years; that the laws and cuſtoms of England ſhould be
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved inviolate; and that no foreigner ſhould be promoted by the duke
to any office in England<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p. 484.</note>.
Theſe articles, providing for the ſecurity of England, in caſe of its
annexation to the crown of France, opened but a diſmal proſpect to the
Engliſh; had not the age of the Queen, who was now in her forty-ninth year,
contributed very much to allay their apprehenſions of this nature. The Queen
alſo, as a proof of her ſtill remaining uncertainty, added a clauſe, that
ſhe was not bound to compleat the marriage, till farther articles, which are
not ſpecified, ſhall be agreed on between the parties, and till the King of
France be certified of their agreement. Soon after the Queen ſent over
Walſingham, as ambaſſador to France, in order to form cloſer connexions
with Henry, and enter into a league offenſive and defenſive againſt the
encreaſing power and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous uſurpations of Spain. The French King, who
had been extremely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed with the unquiet ſpirit, the reſtleſs
ambition, the enterprizing, and yet timid and inconſtant diſpoſition of
Anjou, had already ſought to free the kingdom from his intrigues, by opening
a ſcene for his activity in Flanders; and having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to embrace the
protection of the ſtates, had ſecretly ſupplied him with men and money
for that undertaking. The proſpect of ſettling him in England was for a
like reaſon very agreeable to that monarch; and he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to
cultivate, by every expedient, the favourable ſentiments, which Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
ſeemed to entertain towards them. But this princeſs, tho' ſhe had gone
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in her amorous dalliance<note n="*" place="bottom">Digges, p. 387, 396,
408, 426.</note> than could be juſtified or accounted for by any principles
of policy, was not yet determined to bring matters to a final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;
and ſhe confined Walſingham, in his inſtructions, to the negotiating
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a mutual alliance between France and England<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 352.</note>. Henry with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſubmitted to hold
conferences on that ſubject; but no ſooner had Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham begun to
ſettle the conditions of alliance, than he was informed, that the 
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:0429000102:172"/> Queen, foreſeeing hoſtility with Spain to be the
reſult of this confederacy, had declared, that ſhe would prefer the
marriage with the war, before the war with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the marriage<note n="‡" place="bottom">Digges, p. 375, 391.</note>. The French court, pleaſed with this
change of reſolution, broke off the conferences concerning the league, and
opened a negotiation for the marriage<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p.
392.</note>: But matters had not long proceeded in this train, before the Queen
again declared for the league in preference to the marriage, and ordered
Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham to renew the conferences for that purpoſe. Before he had
leizure to bring this point to maturity, he was interrupted by a new change of
reſolution<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 408, 411.</note>; and not
only the court of France, but Walſingham himſelf, Burleigh, and all the
wiſeſt miniſters of Elizabeth, were in amaze, doubtful where this
conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween inclination and reaſon, love and ambition, would at laſt
terminate.</p>
               <p>IN the courſe of this affair, Elizabeth felt another variety
of intentions, from a new conteſt between her reaſon and her ruling
paſſions. The duke of Anjou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſome aſſiſtance of money, by
which he might be enabled to open the campaign in Flanders; and the Queen
herſelf, tho' her frugality made her long reluctant, was ſenſible that
this ſupply was neceſſary; and ſhe was at laſt induced, after much

own demeſns and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his brother and the Queen dowager,
he levied an army, and took the field againſt the prince of Parma. He was
ſucceſsful in raiſing the ſiege of Cambray; and being choſen by the
ſtates governor of the Netherlands, he put his army into winter quarters, and
came over to England, in order to proſecute his ſuit to the Queen. The
reception, which he met with, made him promiſe himſelf entire ſucceſs,
and gave him hopes, that Elizabeth had ſurmounted all her ſcruples, and was
finally determined to make choice of him for her huſband. 
<note place="margin">17th Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> In the midſt of the
pomp, which attended the anniverſary of her coronation, ſhe was ſeen,
after long and intimate diſcourſe with him, to take a ring from her own
finger, and to put it upon his; and all the ſpectators concluded, that, in
this ceremony, ſhe had given him a promiſe of marriage, and was even
deſirous of ſignifying her intention to all the world. St. Aldegonde,
ambaſſador from the ſtates, diſpatched immediately a letter to his
maſters, informing them of this great event; and the inhabitants of Antwerp,
who, as well as the other lemings, regarded the Queen as a kind of tutelar
divinity, teſtified their joy by boneſires and the diſcharge of their
great ordnance<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 480. Thuau. lib

apprehended and proſecuted by order from the Queen, and was condemned to
loſe his right hand as a libeller. Such was the conſtancy and loyaity of
the man, that, immediately after the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was executed, he took off his

               </p>
               <p>BUT notwithſtanding this attachment, which Elizabeth ſo
openly diſcovered to the duke of Anjou, the conteſt of her ſentiments was
not entirely over; and her ambition, as well as prudence, rouzing itſelf by
intervals, ſtill filled her breaſt with doubt and heſitation. Almoſt
all the courtiers, whom ſhe truſted and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, Leiceſter, Hatton, and
Walſingham, diſcovered an extreme averſion to the marriage; and the
ladies of her bed chamber made no ſcruple of oppoſing her reſolution with
the moſt zealous remonſtrances<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p.
486.</note>. Among other enemies to the match, Sir Philip Sidney, ſon to Sir
Henry Sidney, lord deputy of Ireland, and nephew to Leiceſter; a young man
the moſt accompliſhed of that age; uſed the freedom to write her a
letter, where he diſſwaded her from her preſent reſolution, with an
unuſual elegance of expreſſion, as well as force of reaſoning. He told
her, that the ſecurity of her government depended entirely on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of her proteſtant ſubjects; and ſhe could not, by any meaſure, more
effectually diſguſt them than by eſpouſing a prince, who was ſon to
the perfidious Catherine, brother to the cruel and perfidious Charles, and who
had himſelf embrued his hands in the blood of the innocent and defenceleſs
proteſtants: That the catholics were her mortal enemies, and believed either
that ſhe had originally uſurped the crown, or was now lawfully depoſed by
the pope's bull of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; and nothing had ever ſo much elevated
their hopes as the proſpect of her marriage with the duke of Anjou: That her
chief ſecurity at preſent againſt the efforts of ſo numerous, rich, and
united a ſaction was, that they poſſeſſed no head who could conduct
their dangerous enterprizes; and ſhe herſelf was raſhly ſupplying that
defect, by giving an intereſt in the kingdom to a prince, whoſe education
had zealouſly attached him to that communion: That tho' he was a ſtranger
to the royal blood, the diſpoſitions of men were now ſuch, that they
preferred the religious to the civil connexions; and were more influenced by
the ſympathy of religion than by the principles of legal and hereditary
government: That the duke himſelf had diſcovered a very reſtleſs and
turbulent ſpirit; and having often violated his loyalty to his elder brother
and his ſovereign, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained no hopes that he would paſſively
ſubmit to a woman, whom he might think himſelf intitled, in quality of
huſband, to command: That the French nation, ſo populous, ſo much
abounding in ſoldiers, ſo full of nobility, who were <pb n="569" facs="tcp:0429000102:174"/>
devoted to arms, and, for ſome time, accuſtomed to ſerve for plunder,
would ſupply him with partizans, dangerous to a people, unwarlike and
defenceleſs like the generality of her ſubjects: That the plain and
honourable path, which ſhe had followed, of cultivating the affections of her
people, had hitherto rendered her reign ſecure and happy; and however her
enemies might ſeem to multiply upon her, the ſame invincible rampart was
ſtill able to protect and defend her: That ſo long as the throne of France
was filled by Henry or his poſterity, it was vain to hope that the ties of
blood would enſure the amity of that kingdom, preferably to the maxims of
policy or the prejudices of religion; and if ever the crown devolved to the
duke of Anjou, the conjunction of France and England would prove a burthen,
rather than a protection, to the latter kingdom: That the example of her
ſiſter Mary was ſufficient to inſtruct her in the danger of ſuch
connections; and to prove, that the affections and confidence of the Engliſh
could never be maintained, where they had ſuch reaſon to apprehend that
their intereſts would every moment be ſacrificed to thoſe of a foreign
and hoſtile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That notwithſtanding theſe great inconveniencies,
diſcovered by paſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, the houſe of Burgundy, it muſt be
confeſſed, was more popular in the nation than the family of France; and,
what was of chief moment, Philip was of the ſame communion with Mary, and was
connected with her by this great band of intereſt and affection: And that
however the Queen might remain child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, even tho' old age ſhould grow
upon her, the ſingular felicity and glory of her reign would preſerve her
from contempt; the affections of her ſubjects, and thoſe of all the
proteſtants in Europe, would defend her from attacks; and her own prudence,
without other aid or aſſiſtance, would baffle all the efforts of her
moſt malignant enemies<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters of the Sydneys, vol.

               <p>THESE reflections kept the Queen in great anxiety and
irreſolution; and ſhe was obſerved to paſs ſeveral nights without any
ſleep or repoſe. At laſt her ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled habits of prudence and ambition
prevailed over her temporary inclination; and having ſent for the duke of
Anjou, ſhe had a long converſation with him in private, where ſhe was
ſuppoſed to have made him apologies for the breaking her former
engagements. He expreſſed great diſguſt on his departure; threw away
the ring which ſhe had given him; and uttered many curſes on the mutability
of women, and of iſlanders<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 48<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Scotch affairs.</note> THE anxiety of the
Queen, from the attempts of the Engliſh catholics, never ceaſed during the
whole courſe of her reign; but the variety of revolutions which happened in
all the neighbouring kingdoms, were the ſource ſometimes of her hopes,
ſometimes of her apprehenſions. This year the affairs of Scotland
ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged her attention. The influence which the earl of Lenox, and
James Stuart, who now aſſumed the title of earl of Arran, had acquired over
the young King, was but a ſlender foundation of authority; while the
generality of the nobles, and all the preachers, were ſo much diſcontented
with their adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The aſſembly of the church appointed a
ſolemn faſt; of which one of the avowed reaſons was the danger in which
the King ſtood from the company of wicked perſons<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 319.</note>: And on that day the pulpits
reſounded with declamations againſt Lenox, Arran, and the King's preſent
counſellors. When the minds of the people were ſufficiently prepared by
theſe lectures, a conſpiracy of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was formed, probably with the
concurrence of Elizabeth, for ſeizing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of James at Ruthven, a
ſeat of the earl of Gowry; and the deſign, being kept very ſecret,
ſucceeded without any oppoſition. 
<note place="margin">23 Auguſt.</note> The leaders in this
enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize were, the earl of Gowry himſelf, the earl of Marre, the lords
Lindeſey and Boyd, the maſters of Glamis and Oliphant, the abbots of
Dunfermline, Paiſley, and Cambuſkenneth. The King wept when he found
himſelf detained a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; but the maſter of Glamis ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"No matter for his tears: Better that boys
ſhould weep than bearded men:"</q> An expreſſion which James could never
afterwards forget<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 320.</note>. But
notwithſtanding his reſentment, he found it neceſſary to ſubmit to
the preſent neceſſity. He pretended an entire acquieſcence in the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the aſſociators; acknowleged the detention of his perſon to
be acceptable ſervice; and agreed, to ſummon both an aſſembly of the
church and a convention of eſtates, in order to ratify that enterprize. The
aſſembly, tho' they had eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as an inviolable rule, that the
King, on no account, and on no occaſion, ſhould ever intermeddle in
eccleſiaſtical matters, made no ſcruple of taking civil affairs under
their cognizance, and of giving their verdict, that the attempt of the
conſpirators was acceptable to all that feared God, or tendered the
preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King's perſon, and proſperous ſtate of the realm.
They even enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the clergy to recommend theſe ſentiments from the
pulpit; and they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with eccleſiaſtical cenſures every man who
ſhould oppoſe the authority of the conſederated lords<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 322.</note>. The convention, being compoſed chiefly of
theſe lords them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <pb n="571" facs="tcp:0429000102:176"/> added their ſanction to
theſe proceedings. Arran was confined a priſoner to his own houſe: Lenox,

ſon to his paternal honours and eſtate, took care to eſtabliſh the

               <p>NO ſooner was this revolution known in England, than the Queen
ſent Sir Henry Cary, and Sir Robert Bowes to James, in order to congratulate
him on his deliverance from the pernicious counſels of Lenox and Arran; to
exhort him not to reſent the ſeeming violence of the lords' enterprize; and
to procure from him permiſſion for the return of the earl of Angus, who,
ever ſince Morton's fall, had lived in England. They eaſily prevailed in
the laſt application; and as James ſuſpected, that Elizabeth had not been
entirely unacquainted with the project of his detention, he thought proper,
before the Engliſh ambaſſadors, to diſſemble his reſentment
againſt the confederated noblemen. Soon after La Mothe-Fenelon, and
Menneville, appeared as ambaſſadors from France:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1583</label> Their errand was to enquire concerning the
ſituation of the King, make profeſſions of their maſter's friendſhip,
confirm the ancient league with France, and procure an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation between
him and the Queen of Scots. This laſt propoſal gave great umbrage to the
clergy; and the aſſembly had already voted, the ſettling of terms between
the mother and ſon, to be a moſt wicked undertaking. The pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits
reſounded with declamations againſt the French ambaſſadors;
particularly Fene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, whom they called the Meſſenger of the bloody
murderer, meaning the duke of Guiſe: And as that miniſter, being knight of
the Holy Ghoſt, wore a white croſs on his ſhoulder, they commonly
denominated it in contempt, the badge of Antichriſt. The King endeavoured,
tho' in vain, to repreſs theſe inſolencies; but in order to make the
ambaſſadors ſome compenſation, he deſired the magiſtrates of
Edinburgh to give them a ſplendid dinner before their departure. To prevent
this entertainment, the clergy appointed that very day for a public faſt; and
finding that their orders were not regarded, they employed their whole
ſermons in thundering curſes on the magiſtrates, who, by the King's
direction, had put this mark of reſpect on the ambaſſadors. They even
purſued them afterwards with the cenſures of the church; and it was with
difficulty they prevented from <pb n="572" facs="tcp:0429000102:177"/> paſſing the
ſentence of excommunication againſt them, on account of their
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to royal, preferably to clerical, authority<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 324.</note>.</p>
               <p>WHAT increaſed the alarm with regard to an accommodation
between James and Mary, was, that the Engliſh ambaſſadors ſeemed to
concur with the French in this propoſal; and the clergy were ſo ignorant as
to credit the ſincerity of the profeſſions made by the former. The Queen
of Scots had often made overtures to Elizabeth, which had been entirely
neglected; 
<note place="margin">Letter of Queen Mary to Elizabeth.</note> but
hearing of James's deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe wrote a letter in a more pathetic and more
ſpirited ſtrain than uſual; craving the aſſiſtance of that
princeſs, both for her own and her ſon's liberty. She ſaid, that the
account of the prince's captivity had excited her moſt tender concern; and
the experience which ſhe herſelf, during ſo many years, had of the
extreme infelicity attending that ſituation, had made her the more
apprehenſive, leſt a like fate ſhould her unhappy offspring: That the
long train of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice which ſhe had ſuffered; the calumnies to which
ſhe had been expoſed; were ſo grievous, that, finding no place for right
or truth among men, ſhe was reduced to make her laſt appeal to heaven, the
only competent tribunal between princes of equal juriſdiction, degree, and
dignity: That after her rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſecretly inſtigated by
Elizabeth's miniſters, had expelled her from the throne, had confined her to
priſon, had purſued her with arms, ſhe had voluntarily thrown herſelf
under the protection of England, fatally allured by thoſe reiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
profeſſions of amity which had been made her, and by her confidence in the
generoſity of a friend, an ally, and a kinſwoman: That not contented with
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring her from her preſence, with ſupporting the uſurpers of her
throne, with contributing to the deſtruction of her faithful ſubjects,
Elizabeth had reduced her to a worſe captivity than that from which ſhe had
eſcaped, and had made her this cruel return for the unlimited truſt which
ſhe had repoſed in her: That tho' her reſentment of ſuch ſevere
uſage had never carried her farther than to uſe ſome diſappointed
efforts for her deliverance, unhappy to herſelf, and fatal to others, ſhe
found the rigours of confinement daily multiplied upon her; and at length
carried to ſuch a height as ſurpaſſed the bounds of all human patience
any longer to endure them: That ſhe was cut off from all communication, not
only with the reſt of mankind, but alſo with her only ſon; and her
maternal fondneſs, which was now more enlivened by their unhappy ſympathy
in ſituation, and was her ſole remaining attachment to the world, deprived
even of that melancholy ſolace, which letters or meſſages could give:
That the bitterneſs of her ſorrows, ſtill more than her cloſe
conſinement, had preyed upon her health, and had added the inſufferable
weight of bodily infirmity to all thoſe other calamities under which 
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:0429000102:178"/> ſhe laboured: That while the daily experience of her
maladies opened to her the comfortable proſpect of an approaching deliverance
into a region where pain and ſorrow are no more, her enemies envied her that
laſt conſolation; and having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded her from every joy on earth, had
done what in them lay to debar her from all hopes in her future and eternal
exiſtence: That the exerciſe of her religion was refuſed her; the uſage
of thoſe rites in which ſhe had been educated; the commerce with thoſe
holy miniſters, whom heaven had appointed to receive the acknowlegement of
our tranſgreſſions, and to ſeal our penitence by a ſolemn
re-admiſſion into heavenly favour and forgiveneſs: That it was in vain to
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the rigours of perſecution exerciſed in other kingdoms; when a
Queen, and an innocent woman, was excluded from an indulgence which never yet,
in the moſt barbarous countries, had been denied to the meaneſt and moſt
criminal malefactor: That could ſhe ever be induced to deſcend from that
royal dignity in which Providence had placed her, or depart from her appeal to
Heaven, there was only one other tribunal to which ſhe would appeal from all
her enemies; to the juſtice and humanity of Elizabeth's own breaſt, and to
that lenity, which, uninfluenced by malignant counſel, ſhe would naturally
be induced to exerciſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her: And that ſhe finally intreated her, to
reſume her natural diſpoſition, and to reflect on the ſupport, as well
as comfort, which ſhe might receive from her ſon and herſelf, if, joining
the obligations of gratitude to the ties of blood, ſhe would deign to raiſe
them from their preſent melancholy ſituation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtate them in that
liberty and authority to which they were entitled<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ELIZABETH was chiefly induced to obſtruct Mary's
reſtoration, becauſe ſhe foreſaw an unhappy alternative attending that
event. If this princeſs recovered any conſiderable ſhare of authority in
Scotland, her reſentment, ambition, zeal, and connections, both domeſtic
and foreign, might render her a dangerous neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to England, and enable
her, after ſuppreſſing the Engliſh party among her ſubjects, to
revive thoſe pretenſions which ſhe had formerly advanced to the crown,
and which her partizans in both kingdoms ſtill ſupported with great
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and aſſurance. If ſhe was reinſtated in power, with ſuch
ſtrict limitations as could not be broken, ſhe might be diſguſted with
her ſituation; and flying abroad, form more deſperate attempts than any
ſovereign, who had a crown to hazard, would willingly undertake. Mary
herſelf, ſenſible of theſe difficulties, and convinced by experience,
that Elizabeth would for ever debar her the throne, was now become more humble
in her wiſhes; and as age and infirmities had repreſſed thoſe
ſentiments of ambition and indignation, by which ſhe was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo
much agitated, ſhe was willing to ſacrifice all her hopes of power and 
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:0429000102:179"/> grandeur, in order to obtain a little more liberty; a
bleſſing to which ſhe very naturally aſpired with the fondeſt
impatience. She propoſed, therefore, that ſhe ſhould be aſſociated
with her ſon in the title to the crown of Scotland, but that the
adminiſtration ſhould remain ſolely in him: And ſhe was contented to
live in England, in a private ſtation, and even in a kind of reſtraint; but
with ſome more liberty, both for exerciſe and company, than ſhe had
enjoyed ſince the firſt diſcovery of her intrigues with the duke of
Norfolk. But Elizabeth, who was afraid leſt ſuch a looſe method of
guarding her, would facilitate her eſcape into France or Spain, or, at
leaſt, would encourage and increaſe her partizans, and enable her to
conduct thoſe intrigues to which ſhe had already diſcovered ſo ſtrong
a propenſity, was ſecretly determined to deny her requeſts; and tho'
ſhe feigned to aſſent to them, ſhe well knew how to diſappoint the
expectations of the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py princeſs. While Lenox maintained his authority
in Scotland, ſhe never gave any reply to all the applications made her by the
Scottiſh Queen<note n="†" place="bottom">Jebb, vol. II. p. 540.</note>:
At preſent, when her own creatures had acquired poſſeſſion of the
government, ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to throw the odium of the refuſal upon
them; and pretending, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was required to a perfect accommodation,
but the concurrence of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of ſtate of Scotland, ſhe ordered her
ambaſſador, Bowes, to open the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation for Mary's liberty, and her
aſſociation with her ſon in the title to the crown. Tho' ſhe ſeemed
to make this conceſſion to Mary, ſhe refuſed her the liberty of
ſending any ambaſſador of her own; and that princeſs could eaſily
conjecture, from this circumſtance, what would be the iſſue of the
pretended ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation. The Scotch council, inſtigated by the clergy,
rejected all treaty; and James, who was now a captive in their hands, affirmed,
that he had never aſſented to an aſſociation with his mother, and that
the matter had never gone farther than ſome looſe propoſals for that
purpoſe<note n="‡" place="bottom">MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3.

               <p>THE affairs of Scotland remained not long on the preſent
footing. James, impatient of reſtraint, made his eſcape from his keepers;
and flying to St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, ſummoned his friends and partizans to attend him.
The earls of Argyle, Marſhal, Montroſe, and Rothes, haſtened to pay their
duty to their ſovereign; and the oppoſite party found themſelves unable
to reſiſt ſo powerful a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They were offered a pardon, upon
their ſubmiſſion, and an acknowlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their fault, in ſeizing the
King's perſon, and reſtraining him from his liberty. Some of them accepted
of the terms: The greater number, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Angus, Hamilton, Marre, Glamis,
left the country; and took ſhelter in <pb n="575" facs="tcp:0429000102:180"/> Ireland or
England, where they were protected by Elizabeth. The earl of Arran was recalled
to court; and the malecontents, who could not brook the authority of Lenox, a
man of virtue and moderation, found, that, by their reſiſtance, they had
thrown all the power into the hands of a perſon whoſe councils were as
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as his manners were profligate<note n="‖" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 325, 326, &amp; ſeq.</note>.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH wrote a letter to James; where ſhe quoted a moral
ſentence from Iſocrates, and indirectly reproached him with inconſtancy,
and a breach of his engagements. James, in his reply, juſtified his
meaſures; and turned two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Iſocrates againſt her, for one
which ſhe had directed againſt him<note n="*" place="bottom">Melvil, p. 140,
141. Strype, vol. III. p. 165.</note>. She next ſent Walſingham in an
embaſſy to him; and her chief purpoſe in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that aged miniſter
on an errand where ſo little buſineſs was to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, was to
learn, from a man of ſo much penetration and diſcernment, the real
character and capacity of James. This young prince poſſeſſed very good
parts, tho' not accompanied with that vigour and induſtry which his ſtation
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and as he excelled in general diſcourſe and converſation,
Walſingham entertained a higher idea of his talents than he was afterwards
found, when real buſineſs was tranſacted, to have fully merited<note n="†" place="bottom">Melvil, p. 148. Jebb, vol. II. p. 536.</note>. The
account which he gave his miſtreſs, induced her to treat him thenceforth
with ſome more regard than ſhe had hitherto been inclined to pay him.</p>

perſevering in his preſent views, ſummoned a Parliament; where it was
enacted, that no clergyman ſhould preſume, in his ſermons, to utter

the public meaſures, or to meddle, in an improper manner, with the affairs of

become popiſh in his heart; and they gave their adverſaries the epithets of
groſs libertines, belly gods, and infamous perſons<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 334.</note>. The violent conduct of Arran
ſoon brought over the popularity to their ſide. The earl of Gowry, tho'
pardoned for the late at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, was committed to priſon, was tried on ſome
new accuſations, condemned, and executed. Many innocent perſons ſuffered
from the tyranny of this favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite; and the baniſhed lords, being
aſſiſted by Elizabeth, now found the time favourable for the recovery of
their eſtates and authority. After they had been ſoiled in one attempt upon
Stirling, they prevailed in another; and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the King's
preſence, were pardoned, and reſtored to his favour.</p>

                  <pb n="576" facs="tcp:0429000102:181"/> ARRAN was degraded from authority;
deprived of that eſtate and title which he had uſurped; and the whole
country ſeemed to be compoſed to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. Elizabeth, after
oppoſing, during ſome time, the credit of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, had found it
more expedient, before his fall, to compoſe all differences with him, by the
means of Daviſon, a miniſter whom ſhe ſent to Scotland: But having more
confidence in the lords, whom ſhe had helped to reſtore, ſhe was
pleaſed with this alteration of affairs; and maintained a good
correſpondence with the new court and miniſtry of James.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Conſpiracies in England.</note> THESE
revolutions in Scotland would have been regarded as of ſmall import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to
the repoſe and ſecurity of Elizabeth, had her own ſubjects been entirely
united, and had not the zeal of the catholics, excited by conſtraint, more
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly than perſecution, daily threatened her with ſome dangerous
inſurrection. The vigilance of the miniſters, particularly of Burleigh and
Walſingham, was raiſed in proportion to the activity of the malecontents;
and many arts, which had been blameable in a more peaceable government, were
employed to detect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, and even diſcover the ſecret
inclinations of men. Counterfeit letters were wrote in the name of the Queen of
Scots, or of the Engliſh exiles, and privately conveyed to the houſes of
the catholics: Spies were hired to obſerve the actions and diſcourſe of
ſuſpected perſons: Informers were countenanced: And tho' the ſagacity
of theſe two great miniſters helped them to diſtinguiſh the true from
the falſe intelligence, many calumnies were, no doubt, hearkened to, and all
the ſubjects, particularly the catholics, kept in the utmoſt anxiety and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude. Henry Piercy, earl of Northumberland, brother to the earl
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed ſome years before, and Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, ſon to the
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate duke of Norfolk, fell under ſuſpicion; and the latter was, by
order of the council, confined to his own houſe. Francis Throcmorton, a
private gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was committed to cuſtody, on account of a letter which he
had wrote to the Queen of Scots, and which was intercepted. Lord Pager, and
Charles Arundel, who had been engaged with him in treaſonable deſigns,
immediately withdrew beyond ſea. Throcmorton confeſſed, that a plan for
an invaſion and inſurrection had been laid; and tho', on his trial, he was
deſirous of retracting this confeſſion, and imputing it to the fear of
torture, he was found guilty and executed. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza, the Spaniſh
ambaſſador, having promoted this conſpiracy, was ordered to depart the
kingdom; and Wade was ſent into Spain, to excuſe his diſmiſſion, and
to deſire the King to ſend another ambaſſador in his place: But Philip
would not ſo much as admit the Engliſh ambaſſador to his preſence.
Creighton, a Scotch Jeſuit, coming over on board a veſſel which was
ſeized, tore ſome papers, with <pb n="577" facs="tcp:0429000102:182"/> an intention of
throwing them into the ſea; but the wind blowing them back upon the ſhip,
they were put together, and diſcovered ſome dangerous ſecrets<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 499.</note>.</p>
               <p>MANY of theſe conſpiracies were, with great appearance of
reaſon, imputed to the contrivances of the Queen of Scots<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype, vol. III. p. 246.</note>; and as her name was employed in
all of them, the council thought, that they could not uſe too many
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions againſt the danger of her claims, and the reſtleſs activity
of her temper. She was removed from under the care of the earl of Shrewſbury,
who, tho' vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and faithful in that truſt, had alſo been indulgent to
his priſoner, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly with regard to air and exerciſe: And ſhe was
committed to the cuſtody of Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drue Drury; men of
honour, but inflexible and rigid in their care and attention. An
aſſociation was alſo ſet on foot by the earl of Leiceſter and other
courtiers; and as Elizabeth was extremely beloved by the whole nation, except
the more zealous catholics, men of all ranks willingly flocked to the
ſubſcription of it. The purport of this aſſociation was to defend the
Queen, to revenge her death or any injury committed againſt her, and to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the throne any perſon, whatever title they poſſeſſed,

                  <note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> ELIZABETH, that ſhe
might the more diſcourage all malecontents, by ſhewing them the concurrence
of the nation in her favour, ſummoned a new Parliament; and ſhe met with
that dutiful attachment, which ſhe expected. The aſſociation was
confirmed by Parliament; and a clauſe was added, by which the Queen was
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to name commiſſioners for the trial of any pretender to the
crown, who ſhould attempt or imagine any invaſion, inſurrection, or
aſſaſſination againſt the Queen: Upon condemnation, pronounced by
theſe commiſſioners, the perſon was excluded from all claim to the
ſucceſſion, and was farther puniſhable, as her majeſty ſhould
direct. And for the greater ſecurity, a council of regency, in caſe of the
Queen's violent death, was appointed to govern the kingdom, to ſettle the
ſucceſſion, and to take vengeance of that act of treaſon<note n="‖" place="bottom">27 Eliz. cap. 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>A SEVERE law was alſo enacted againſt jeſuits and popiſh
prieſts: That they ſhould depart the kingdom within forty days; that
thoſe who ſhould remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that time, or ſhould afterwards return,
ſhould be guilty of high treaſon; that thoſe who harboured or relieved
them ſhould be guilty of felony; that <pb n="578" facs="tcp:0429000102:183"/> thoſe who were
educated in ſeminaries, if they returned not in ſix months after notice
given, and ſubmitted not themſelves to the Queen, before a biſhop or two
juſtices, ſhould be guilty of high treaſon: And that if any, ſo
ſubmitting themſelves, ſhould, within ten years, approach the Queen's
court, or come within ten miles of it, their ſubmiſſion ſhould be
void<note n="†" place="bottom">2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

religion, which had formerly been prohibited under lighter penalties, and which
was, in many inſtances, connived at, was totally ſuppreſſed. In the
ſubſequent part of the Queen's reign, the law was ſometimes executed, by
the capital puniſhment of prieſts; and tho' the partizans of that
princeſs aſſerted, that they were puniſhed for their treaſon, not
their religion, the apology muſt only be ſo underſtood that this ſevere
law was enacted on account of the treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able views and attempts of the
ſect, not that every individual, who ſuffered the penalty of the law, was
convicted of treaſon<note n="‡" place="bottom">Some even of thoſe who
defend the Queen's meaſures, allow that in ten years fifty prieſts were
executed and fifty-five baniſhed. Camden, p. 649.</note>. The catholics,
therefore, might now juſtly complain of a very violent perſecution; which,
we may ſafely affirm, in ſpite of the rigid and bigotted maxims of that
age, not to be the beſt method of converting them, or of reconciling them to
the eſtabliſhed government and religion.</p>
               <p>THE Parliament, beſides arming the Queen with theſe powers,
granted her a ſupply of one ſubſidy and two fifteenths. The only
circumſtance, in which their proceedings were diſagreeable to her, was an
application, which the commons made for a farther reformation in
eccleſiaſtical matters. Yet even in this attempt, which affected her, as
well as them, in a very delicate point, they diſcovered how much they were
overawed by her authority. The majority of the houſe were puritans, or
inclined to that ſect<note n="*" place="bottom">Beſides the petition
after-mentioned, another proof of the prevalency of the puritans among the
commons was their paſſing a bill for the reverend obſervance of Sunday,
which they called the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and the depriving the people of thoſe
amuſements, which they were accuſtomed to take on that day. D'Ewes, p. 335.
It was a ſtrong ſymptom of a contrary ſpirit in the upper houſe, that
they propoſed to add Wedneſday to the faſt days, and to prohibit entirely
the eating of fleſh on that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> D'Ewes, p. 373.</note>; but the
ſevere reprimands, which they had already, in former ſeſſions, met with
from the throne, deterred them from introducing any bill concerning religion; a
proceeding which would have been interpreted as an incroachment on the royal
prerogative: They were contented to proceed by way of humble petition, and that
not to her majeſty, which would certainly have given ſome offence, but to
the houſe of lords, or rather to the biſhops, who had a ſeat in that
houſe, and from whom alone they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <pb n="579" facs="tcp:0429000102:184"/> to
receive all advances towards reformation<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p.
357.</note>. A ſtrange departure from what we now apprehend to be the dignity
of the commons!</p>
               <p>THE commons deſired in their humble petition, that no biſhop
ſhould exerciſe his function of ordination but with the conſent and
concurrence of ſix preſbyters: A demand, which as it would have introduced
a change of eccleſiaſtical government, was firmly rejected by the prelates.
They deſired, that no clergyman ſhould be inſtituted into any benefice,
without previous warning being given to the pariſh, that they might examine
whether there lay any objection to his life or doctrine: But this attempt
towards a popular model naturally met with the ſame fate. In another article
of the petition, they prayed, that the biſhops ſhould not inſiſt upon
every ceremony, or deprive incumbents for omitting a part of the ſervice: As
if uniformity in public worſhip had not been eſtabliſhed by law; or as if
the prelates had been endowed with a diſpenſing power. They complained of
abuſes, which prevailed, in denouncing the ſentence of excommunication, and
entreated the reverend fathers to think of ſome law for the remedy of theſe
abuſes: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that thoſe matters were too high for the commons of
themſelves to meddle with them.</p>
               <p>BUT the moſt material article, which the commons touched upon
in their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, was the eccleſiaſtical commiſſion, and the oath
<hi>ex officio,</hi> as it was called, exacted by that court. This is a
ſubject of ſuch importance, as to merit ſome explanation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical court.</note> THE
firſt primate after the Queen's acceſſion, was Parker; a man rigid in
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting conformity to the eſtabliſhed worſhip, and in puniſhing by
fines or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, all the puritans, who attempted to innovate any thing
in the habits, ceremonies, or liturgy of the church. He died in 1575; and was
ſucceeded by Grindal, who, as he himſelf inclined to the new ſect, was
with great difficulty brought to execute the law againſt them, or to puniſh
the nonconforming clergy. He declined obeying the Queen's orders for the
ſuppreſſion of <hi>prophecyings,</hi> which, ſhe apprehended, had
become ſo many academies of fanaticiſm; and for this offence, ſhe had, by
an order of the Star Chamber, ſequeſtered him from his archiepiſcopal
function, and confined him to his own houſe. Upon his death, which happened
in 1583, ſhe was determined not to fall into the ſame error in her next
choice; and ſhe named Whitgift, a zealous churchman, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſignalized his pen in controverſy, and who, having in vain attempted to
convince the puritans by argument, was now determined to open their eyes by
power, and by the execution of penal ſtatutes. He informed the Queen, that
all the ſpiritual authority lodged in the prelates was vain without the
ſanction of the <pb n="580" facs="tcp:0429000102:185"/> crown; and as there was no
eccleſiaſtical commiſſion at that time in force, he engaged her to
iſſue a new one; more arbitrary than any of the former, and conveying more
unlimited authority<note n="*" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſtory of the Puritans,
vol. I. p. 410.</note>. She appointed forty-four commiſſioners, twelve of
whom were eccleſiaſtics; three commiſſioners could exerciſe the whole
power of the court; their juriſdiction extended over the whole kingdom, and
over all orders of men; and every circumſtance of their authority, and all
their methods of proceeding, were contrary to the cleareſt principles of law
and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural equity. They were empowered to viſit and reform all errors,
hereſies, ſchiſms, in a word, to regulate all opinions, as well as to
puniſh all breach of uniformity in the exerciſe of public worſhip. They
were directed to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, not only by the legal methods of juries and
witneſſes, but by all other means and ways, which they could deviſe; that
is, by the rack, by torture, by inquiſition, by impriſonment. Where they
thought proper to ſuſpect any perſon, they might adminiſter to him an
oath, called <hi>ex officio,</hi> by which he was bound to anſwer all
queſtions, and might thereby be obliged to accuſe himſelf or his moſt
intimate friend. The fines, which they impoſed, were merely diſcretionary,
and often occaſioned the total ruin of the offenders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the
eſtabliſhed law of the kingdom. The impriſonment, to which they condemned
any delinquent, was limited by no rule but their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. They
aſſumed a power of impoſing on the clergy what new articles of
ſubſcription, and conſequently of faith, they thought proper. Tho' all
other ſpiritual courts were ſubject, ſince the reformation, to
inhibitions from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme courts of law, the eccleſiaſtical
commiſſioners exempted themſelves from that legal juriſdiction, and
were liable to no controul. And the more to enlarge their authority, they were
empowered to puniſh all inceſts, adulteries, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; all outrages,
miſbehaviours, and diſorders in marriage: And the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which
they might inflict, were according to their wiſdom, conſcience, and
diſcretion. In a word, this court was a real <hi>inquiſition;</hi> attended
with all the iniquities, as well as cruelties, inſeparable from that horrid
tribunal. And as the juriſdiction of the eccleſiaſtical court was
deſtructive of all law, ſo its erection was deemed by many a mere
uſurpation of this imperious princeſs, and had no other foundation than a
clauſe of a ſtatute, reſtoring the ſupremacy to the crown, and
empowering the ſovereign to appoint commiſſioners for exerciſing that
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. But prerogative in general, and eſpecially the ſupremacy,
were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in that age to involve powers, which no law, precedent, or
reaſon could limit and determine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="581" facs="tcp:0429000102:186"/> BUT tho' the commons, in their humble
petition to the prelates, had touched ſo gently and ſubmiſſively the
eccleſiaſtical grievances, the Queen, in a ſpeech from the throne at the

kingdom but by her permiſſion and negligence: That ſome abuſes muſt
neceſſarily have place in every thing; but ſhe warned the prelates to be
watchful; for if ſhe found them careleſs of their charge, ſhe was fully
determined to depoſe them: That ſhe was commonly ſuppoſed to have
employed herſelf in many ſtudies, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly philoſophical (by which,
I ſuppoſe, ſhe meant theological) and ſhe would confeſs, that few,
whoſe leizure had not allowed them to make profeſſion of ſcience, had
read or reflected more: That as ſhe could diſcern the preſumption of
many, in curiouſly canvaſſing the ſcriptures, and ſtarting
innovations, ſhe would no longer endure this licence; but meant to guide her
people, by God's rule, in the juſt mean between the corruptions of Rome and
the errors of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ſectaries: And that as the Romaniſts were the
inveterate enemies of her perſon, ſo the other innovators were dangerous to
all kingly government; and under colour of preaching the word of God,
preſumed to exerciſe their private judgment, and to cenſure the actions
of the prince<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 328. This ſect had indeed

from yielding to the diſpleaſure of the Parliament againſt the
eccleſiaſtical commiſſion, granted a new commiſſion before the end
of her reign; in which ſhe enlarged, rather than reſtrained, the powers of

                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:0429000102:187"/> DURING this ſeſſion of Parliament,
there was diſcovered a conſpiracy, which much encreaſed the natural
animoſity againſt the catholics, and ſtill farther widened the breach
between the religious parties. William Parry, a catholic gentleman, had
received the Queen's pardon for a crime, by which he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to capital
puniſhment; and having got permiſſion to travel, he retired to Milan, and
made open profeſſion of his religion, which he had concealed while he
remained in England. He was here perſuaded by Palmio, a jeſuit, that he
could not perform a more meritorious action, than to take away the life of his
ſovereign and his benefactreſs; the nuncio, Campeggio, when conſulted,
approved extremely of this pious undertaking; and Parry, tho' ſtill agitated
with doubts, came to Paris, with an intention of paſſing over to England,
and executing his bloody purpoſe. He was here encouraged in the deſign by
Thomas Morgan, a gentleman of great credit in the party; and tho' Watts and
ſome other catholic prieſts told him, that the enterprize was criminal and
impious, he preferred the authority of Raggazzoni, the pope's nuncio at Paris,
and was determined to perſiſt in his reſolution. He here wrote a letter
to the pope, which was conveyed to cardinal Como; communicated his intention to
the holy father; and craved his abſolution and paternal benediction. He
received an anſwer from the cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, by which he perceived that his
purpoſe was extremely applauded; and he came over to England with a full
deſign of carrying it into execution. So deeply are the ſentiments of
morality engraved in mens breaſts, that it is very difficult even for the
prejudices of falſe religion totally to efface them; and this bigotted
aſſaſſin reſolved, before he came to extremity, to try every other
expedient for alleviating the perſecutions, under which the catholics at that
time laboured. He found means of being introduced to the Queen; aſſured her
that many conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were formed againſt her; and exhorted her, as the
only means of ſaving her life, to give the Romaniſts ſome more indulgence
in the exerciſe of their religion: But leſt he ſhould be tempted by the
opportunity to aſſaſſinate her, he always came to court unprovided of
every offenſive weapon. He even procured himſelf to be elected member of
Parliament; and having made a vehement ſpeech againſt the ſevere laws
enacted this laſt ſeſſion, was committed to cuſtody for his freedom,
and ſequeſtred from the houſe. His failure in theſe attempts confirmed
him the more in his former reſolution, and he communicated his intentions to
Nevil, who entered zealouſly into the deſign, and was determined to have a
ſhare in the merits of its execution. A book, newly publiſhed by Dr. Allen,
afterwards created a cardinal, ſerved farther to efface all their ſcruples,
with regard to the murder of a heretical prince; and having agreed to ſhoot
the Queen as ſhe was riding on horſeback, they reſolved, if they could
not make their eſcape, to ſacrifice their <pb n="583" facs="tcp:0429000102:188"/> lives in
fulfilling a duty, ſo agreeable, as they imagined, to the will of God, and to
true religion. But while they were watching an opportunity for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of their purpoſe, the earl of Weſtmoreland happened to die in exile; and as
Nevil was next heir to that family, he began to entertain hopes, that, by doing
an acceptable ſervice to the Queen, he might recover the eſtate and
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which had been forfeited by the rebellion of the laſt earl.

miniſters; and Parry, being thrown into priſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the guilt,
both to them, and to the jury who tried him. The letter from cardinal Como
being produced in court, put Parry's narrative beyond all queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that
criminal, having received ſentence of death<note n="*" place="bottom">State

engaged in a conſpiracy with lord Paget for the delivery of the Queen of

be proved upon him, at leaſt, that ſentence would infallibly be pronounced
againſt him, he freed himſelf from farther proſecution by a voluntary
death. He ſhot himſelf into the breaſt with a piſtol. About the ſame
time, the earl of Arundel, ſon to the unfortunate duke of Norfolk, having
entered into ſome exceptionable meaſures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the unhappy
fate, which had attended his family, endeavoured to depart ſecretly beyond
ſea, but was diſcovered and thrown into the Tower. In 1587 this nobleman
was brought to his trial for high treaſon; chiefly becauſe he had dropped
ſome expreſſions of affection to the Spaniards, and had affirmed that he
would have maſſes ſaid for the ſucceſs of the armada. His peers found
him guilty of treaſon: This ſevere ſentence was not executed; but Arundel
never recovered his liberty. He died a priſoner in 1595. He carried his
religious auſterities ſo far, that they were believed the immediate cauſe
of his death.</note>.</p>
               <p>THESE bloody deſigns now appeared every where, as the reſult
of that bigotted ſpirit by which the two religions, eſpecially the
catholic, were at this time actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. One Somerville, a gentleman of the
county of Warwic, ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered in his underſtanding, had heard
ſo much of the merit attending the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination of heretics and
perſecutors, that he came to London with a view of murdering the Queen; but
having betrayed his deſign by ſome extravagances, he was thrown into
priſon, and there periſhed by a voluntary death<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p. 495.</note>. 
<note place="margin">Affairs of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> About
the ſame time, Baltazar Gerard, a Burgundian, undertook, and executed the
ſame deſign againſt the prince of Orange; and that great man periſhed
at Delſt, by the hands of a deſperate aſſaſſin, who, with a
reſolution worthy of a better cauſe, ſacrificed his own life, in order to
deſtroy the famous reſtorer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of religious liberty. The
Flemings, who regarded that prince as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were filled with infinite
regret, as well when they conſidered the miſerable end of ſo brave a
patriot, as their own forlorn condition, from the loſs of ſo 
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:0429000102:189"/> powerful and prudent a leader, and from the rapid
progreſs of the Spaniſh arms. The prince of Parma had made every year great
advances upon them, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſeveral of the provinces to obedience, and
had laid cloſe ſiege to Antwerp, the richeſt and moſt populous city of
the Netherlands, whoſe ſubjection, it was foreſeen, would give a mortal
blow to the already declining affairs of the revolted States. The only hopes
which remained to them, aroſe from the proſpect of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſuccours.
Being well acquainted with the cautious and frugal maxims of Elizabeth, they
promiſed themſelves better ſucceſs in France; and in the view of
engaging Henry to embrace their defence, they tendered him the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
of their provinces. But the preſent condition of that monarchy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the
King to reject ſo advantageous an offer. The duke of Anjou's death, which, he
thought, would have delivered him from the intrigues of that fickle and
turbulent prince, plunged him into the deepeſt diſtreſs; and the King of
Navarre, a profeſſed Hugonot, being next heir to the crown, the duke of
Guiſe took thence occaſion to revive the catholic league, and to urge
Henry, by the moſt violent expedients, to ſeek the excluſion and
ſuppreſſion of that brave and virtuous prince. Henry himſelf, tho' a
zealous catholic, yet, becauſe he declined complying with their precipitant
meaſures, became an object of averſion to the league; and as his zeal in
practiſing all the ſuperſtitious obſervances of the Romiſh church,
was accompanied with a very licentious conduct in private life, the catholic
faction, in contradiction to the moſt vulgar experience, embraced thence the
pretext of repreſenting his devotion as mere hypocriſy and deceit. Finding
his authority to decline, he was obliged to declare war againſt the Hugonots,
and to put arms into the hands of the League, whom, both on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their
dangerous pretenſions at home, and their cloſe alliance with Philip, he
ſecretly regarded as his more dangerous enemies. Conſtrained by the ſame
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, he perceived the danger of aſſociating himſelf with the revolted
proteſtants in the Low Countries, and was obliged to renounce that inviting
occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging himſelf for all the hoſtile intrigues and
enterprizes of Philip.</p>
               <p>THE States, reduced to this extremity, ſent over a ſolemn
embaſſy to London, and made offer to the Queen, of acknowleging her for
their ſovereign, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of obtaining her protection and
aſſiſtance. Elizabeth's wiſeſt counſellors were very much divided
in opinion, in regard to the conduct which ſhe ſhould hold in this critical
and important emergence. Some adviſed the rejecting the offer of the States,
and repreſented the imminent dangers, as well as injuſtice, attending the
acceptance of them. They ſaid, that the rebellion of ſubjects was the
common cauſe of all ſovereigns, and the encouragement of a revolt in the
Flemiſh, might prove the example to a like pernicious practice in the
Engliſh: <pb n="585" facs="tcp:0429000102:190"/> That tho' princes were bound by the laws of
the Supreme Being, not to oppreſs their ſubjects, the people never were
entitled to forget all duty to their ſovereign, or transfer, from every fancy
or diſguſt, or even from the juſteſt ground of complaint, their
obedience to any other maſter: That the Queen, in the ſuccours hitherto
afforded the Flemings, had conſidered them as labouring under
oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not as entitled to freedom; and had intended only to
admoniſh Philip not to perſevere in his tyranny, without any view of
raviſhing from him theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which he enjoyed by hereditary right
from his anceſtors: That her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Ireland, and even in England,
would afford that powerful monarch ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient opportunity of retaliating
upon her; and ſhe muſt henceforth expect, that, inſtead of ſecretly
ſomenting faction, he would openly employ his whole force in the protection
and defence of the catholics. That the pope would undoubtedly unite his
ſpiritual arms to the temporal ones of Spain; and that the Queen would ſoon
repent her making ſo ſmall and precarious an acquiſition in foreign
countries, by expoſing her own dominions to ſuch imminent danger<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 507. Bentivoglio, partz. lib. iv.</note>.</p>
               <p>OTHER counſellors of Elizabeth maintained a contrary opinion.
They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that the Queen had not even from the beginning of her
reign, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had not at preſent, the choice, whether ſhe would
embrace friendſhip or hoſtility with Philip: That by the whole tenor of
that prince's conduct it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that his ſole aims were, the extenſion
of his empire, and the utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the proteſtants, under the
ſpecious pretence of maintaining the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic faith: That the provocations
which ſhe had already given him, joined to this general ſcheme of policy,
would for ever render him her implacable enemy; and as ſoon as he had
ſubdued his revolted ſubjects, he would undoubtedly fall, with the whole
force of his united empire, on her defenceleſs ſtate: That the only
queſtion was, whether ſhe would maintain a war, abroad and ſupported by
allies, or wait till the ſubjection of all the confederates of England,
ſhould give her enemies leiſure to begin their hoſtilities in the bowels
of that kingdom: That the revolted provinces, tho' in a declining condition,
poſſeſſed ſtill conſiderable force; and by the aſſiſtance of
England, by the advantages of their ſituation, and by their inveterate
antipathy to Philip, might ſtill be enabled to maintain the conteſt
againſt the Spaniſh monarchy: That their maritime power, united to the
Queen's would give her entire ſecurity on that ſide from which alone ſhe
could be aſſaulted, and would even enable her to make inroads on Philip's
dominions, both in Europe and the Indies: That a war which was neceſſary,
could never be unjuſt; and ſelf-defence was concerned, as well in warding
certain dangers at a diſtance, as in repelling any immediate invaſion: And
that ſince hoſtility with <pb n="586" facs="tcp:0429000102:191"/> Spain was the unavoidable
conſequence of the preſent intereſts and ſituations of the two
monarchies, it was better to compenſate that danger and loſs by the
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of ſuch important provinces to the Engliſh empire<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, ibid. Bentivoglio, ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>AMIDST theſe oppoſite councils, the Queen, apprehenſive of
the conſequences attending each extreme, was inclined to ſteer a middle
courſe; and tho' ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is ſeldom prudent, ſhe was not, in this
reſolution, guided by any prejudice or affection. She was determined not to
ſee, without oppoſition, the total ruin of the revolted provinces, whoſe
intereſts ſhe eſteemed ſo cloſely connected with her own: But
foreſeeing, that the acceptance of their ſovereignty would engage her to
employ her whole force in their defence, would give umbrage to her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and would expoſe her to the reproach of ambition and uſurpation,
impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which ſhe had hitherto carefully avoided, ſhe immediately rej
cted this offer. She concluded a league with the States on the following
conditions: That ſhe ſhould ſend over an army to their aſſiſtance,
of five thouſand foot and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe, and pay them during the war;
that the general, and two others, whom ſhe ſhould appoint, ſhould be
admitted into the council of the States; that neither party ſhould make peace
without the conſent of the other; that her expences ſhould be refunded
after the concluſion of the war; and that the towns of Fluſhing and the
Brille, with the caſtle of Rammekins, ſhould, in the mean time, be
conſigned into her hands, by way of ſecurity.</p>
               <p>THE Queen knew that this meaſure would immediately engage her
in open hoſtilities with Philip; yet was ſhe not terrified with the view of
the preſent greatneſs of that ambitious, and enterprizing monarch. The
continent of Spain was at that time rich and populous; and the late addition of
Portugal, beſides ſecuring internal tranquillity, had annexed an opulent
kingdom to Philip's dominions, had made him maſter of many ſettlements in
the Eaſt-Indies, and of the whole commerce of thoſe regions, and had
mightily increaſed his naval power, in which he was before chiefly deficient.
All the princes of Italy, even the pope and the court of Rome, were reduced to
a kind of ſubjection under him, and ſeemed to poſſeſs their
ſovereignty on very precarious and uncertain terms. The Auſtrian branch in
Germany, with all their dependant principalities, was cloſely connected with
him, and was ready to ſupply him with troops for every enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. The whole
treaſures of the Weſt Indies were in his poſſeſſion; and the
preſent ſcarcity of the precious metals in every country of Europe,
rendered the inſſuence of his riches the more forcible and extenſive. The
Netherlands ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the point of relapſing into ſervitude; and ſmall
hopes were entertained of <pb n="587" facs="tcp:0429000102:192"/> their withſtanding thoſe
numerous and veteran armies which, under the command of the moſt experienced
generals, he employed againſt them. Even France, which uſed to
counterballance the Auſtrian greatneſs, had loſt all her force from
inteſtine commotions; and as the catholics, the ruling party, were cloſely
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with him, he rather expected thence an augmentation, than a
diminution, of his power. Upon the whole, ſuch prepoſſeſſions were
every where entertained concerning the force of the Spaniſh monarchy, that
the King of Sweden, when he heard that Elizabeth had openly embraced the
defence of the revolted Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſcrupled not to ſay, that ſhe had now
taken the diadem from her head, and had adventured it upon the doubtful chance
of war<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden.

ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cautious than enterprizing in her natural temper: She ever needed more
to be impelled by the vigour, than reſtrained by the prudence of her
miniſters: But when ſhe ſaw an evident neceſſity, ſhe braved danger
with magnanimous courage; and truſting to her own conſummate wiſdom, and
to the affections, however di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, of her people, ſhe prepared herſelf to
reſiſt, and even to aſſault, the whole force of the catholic
monarch.</p>
               <p>THE earl of Leiceſter was ſent over to Holland, at the head
of the Engliſh auxiliary forces. He carried with him a ſplendid retinue;

unavoidable, reſolved not to leave him unmoleſted on that 
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:0429000102:193"/> quarter. The great ſucceſs of the Spaniards and
Portugueze in both Indies had excited a ſpirit of emulation in England; and
as the ſucceſs of commerce, ſtill more of planting colonies, is ſlow
and gradual, it was happy, that a war, in this critical age, had opened a more
flattering proſpect to the avarice and ambition of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and had
tempted them, by the view of ſudden and exorbitant profit, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in
naval enterprizes. A fleet of twenty ſail was equipped to attack the
Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard in the Weſt-Indies: Two thouſand three hundred volunteers,
beſides ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, engaged on board of it: Sir Francis Drake was appointed
admiral; Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher Carliſle commander of the land forces. They took St.
Jago, near Cape Verde, by ſurprize; and found in it plenty of proviſions,
but no riches. <label type="milestone">

Hiſpaniola; and eaſily making themſelves maſter of St. Domingo by
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, obliged the inhabitants to ranſom their houſes by a ſum of
money. Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena fell next into their hands, after ſome more
reſiſtance, and was treated in the ſame manner. They burned St. Anthony
and St. Helens, two towns on the coaſt of Florida. Sailing along the coaſt
of Virginia, they found the ſmall remains of a colony which had been planted
there by Sir Walter Raleigh, and which had gone extremely to decay. This was
the firſt attempt of the Engliſh to form ſuch ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements; and tho'
they have ſince ſurpaſſed all European nations, both in the
ſituations of their colonies, and in the noble principles of liberty and
induſtry, on which they are founded; they had here been ſo
unſucceſsful, that the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable planters abandoned their ſettlements,
and prevailed on Drake to carry them with him to England. He returned with ſo
much riches as encouraged the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, and with ſuch accounts of the
Spaniſh weakneſs in thoſe countries as ſerved extremely to inflame the
ſpirits of the nation to future enterprizes. The great mortality which the
climate had produced in his fleet, was, as is uſual, but a feeble reſtraint
on the avidity and ſanguine hopes of young adventurers<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 509.</note>. It is thought that Drake's fleet firſt
introduced the uſe of tobacco into England.</p>
               <p>THE enterprizes of Leiceſter were much leſs ſucceſsful
than thoſe of Drake. This man poſſeſſed neither courage nor capacity,
equal to the truſts repoſed in him by the Queen; and as he was the only bad
choice whom ſhe made for any conſiderable advancement, men naturally
believed, that ſhe had here been influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by an affection ſtill more
partial than that of friendſhip. He gained at firſt ſome advantage in an
action againſt the Spaniards; and threw ſuccours into Grave, by which that
place was enabled to make a vigorous defence: But the cowardice of the
governor, Van Hemert, rendered all theſe efforts uſeleſs. He capitulated
after a very feeble reſiſtance; and being tried for his conduct, ſuffered
a capital puniſhment from the ſentence of a court martial. The prince of
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma <pb n="589" facs="tcp:0429000102:194"/> next undertook the ſiege of Venlo, which was
ſurrendered to him, after ſome reſiſtance. The fate of Nuys was more
diſmal; being taken by aſſault, while the garriſon was treating of a
capitulation. Rhimberg, which was garriſoned by twelve hundred Engliſh,
under the command of colonel Morgan, was afterwards beſieged by the
Spaniards; and Leiceſter, thinking himſelf too weak to attempt raiſing
the ſiege, endeavoured to draw off the prince of Parma by forming ſome
other enterprize. He firſt attacked Doeſberg, and ſucceeded: He then
ſat down before Zutphen, which the Spaniſh general thought ſo important a
place, that he haſtened to its relief. He made the marqueſs of Guaſto
advance with a convoy, which he intended to throw into the place. They were
favoured by a fog; but falling by chance on a body of Engliſh cavalry, a
furious action enſued, in which the Spaniards were worſted, and the
marqueſs of Gonzaga, an Italian nobleman of great reputation and family, was
ſlain. The purſuit was ſtopt by the advance of the prince of Parma with
the main body of the Spaniſh army; and the Engliſh cavalry, on their return
from the field, found their advantage more than compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated by the loſs of
Sir Philip Sidney, who, being mortally wounded in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was carried off
by the ſoldiers, and ſoon after died. This perſon is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the
writers of that age as the moſt perfect model of an accompliſhed gentleman
which was ever formed even by the wanton imagination of poetry or fiction.
Virtuous conduct, polite converſation, heroic valour, and elegant erudition,
all concurred to render him the ornament and delight of the Engliſh court;
and as the credit which he poſſeſſed with the Queen and the earl of
Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, was wholly employed in the encouragement of genius and
literature, his praiſes have been tranſmitted with advantage to
poſterity. No perſon was ſo low as not to become an object of his
humanity. After this laſt action, while he was lying on the field, mangled
with wounds, a bottle of water was brought him to relieve his thirſt; but
obſerving a ſoldier near him in a like miſerable condition, he ſaid,
<hi>This man's neceſſity is ſtill greater than mine:</hi> And reſigned
to him the bottle of water. The King of Scots, ſtruck with admiration of
Sidney's virtue, celebrated his memory by a copy of Latin verſes, which he
compoſed on occaſion of the death of that young hero.</p>
               <p>THE Engliſh, tho' a long peace had deprived them of all
experience, were ſtrongly poſſeſſed of military genius; and the
advantages gained by the prince of Parma were not attributed to the ſuperior
bravery and diſcipline of the Spaniards, but ſolely to the miſconduct of
Leiceſter. The States were much diſcontented with his management of the
war; but ſtill more with his arbitrary and imperious conduct; and at the end
of the campaign, they applied to him for a redreſs of <pb n="590" facs="tcp:0429000102:195"/>
all their grievances. But Leiceſter, without giving them any ſatisfaction,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſoon after for England<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 512.

               <p>THE Queen, while ſhe provoked ſo powerful an enemy as the
King of Spain, was not forgetful to ſecure herſelf on the ſide of
Scotland; and ſhe endeavoured both to cultivate the friendſhip and alliance
of her kinſman, James, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all grounds of quarrel between them. An
attempt which ſhe had made ſome time before, was not well calculated to
gain the confidence of that prince. She diſpatched Wotton as her
ambaſſador to Scotland; but tho' ſhe gave him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate inſtructions
with regard to her affairs, ſhe informed James, that when ſhe had any
political buſineſs to diſcuſs with him, ſhe would employ another
miniſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this man was not fitted for ſerious negociations; and
that her chief purpoſe in ſending him, was to entertain the King with witty
and facetious converſation, and to partake without reſerve of his
pleaſures and amuſements. Wotton was maſter of profound
diſſimulation, and knew how to cover, under the appearance of a careleſs
gaiety, the deepeſt deſigns, and moſt dangerous artifices. When but a
youth of twenty, he had been employed by his uncle, Dr. Wotton, ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
in France during the reign of Mary, to enſnare the conſtable, Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency;
and had not his purpoſe been fruſtrated by pure accident, his cunning had
prevailed over all the caution and experience of that aged miniſter. It is no
wonder, that, after years had ſo much improved him in all arts of deceit, he
ſhould gain an aſcendent over a young prince, of ſo open and unguarded a
temper as James, eſpecially when the Queen's recommendation prepared the way
for his artifices. He was admitted into all the pleaſures of the King; made
himſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all his ſecrets; and had ſo much the more authority
with him in political tranſactions, that he did not ſeem to pay the leaſt
attention or regard to theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Scotch miniſters, who obſerved
the growing intereſt of this man, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to acquire his friendſhip;
and ſcrupled not to ſacrifice to his intrigues the moſt eſſential
intereſts of their maſter. Elizabeth's uſual jealouſies with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to
her heirs began now to be levelled againſt James; and as that prince had a
tained the years proper for marriage, ſhe was apprehenſive, leſt, by
being ſtrengthened with children and alliances, he ſhould acquire the
greater intereſt and authority with her Engliſh ſubjects. She directed
Wotton to form a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with ſome Scotch nobleman, and to procure
their promiſe, that James, during three years, ſhould not, on any account,
be permitted to marry. In conſequence of this view, they endeavoured to
embroil him with the King of Denmark, who had ſent ambaſſadors to
Scotland, under pretence of demanding the reſtitution of the 
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:0429000102:196"/> Orkneys, but really with a view of opening a propoſal
of marriage between James and his daughter. Wotton is ſaid to have employed
his intrigues to purpoſes ſtill more dangerous. He formed a conſpiracy
with ſome malecontents, to ſeize the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, and to deliver
him into the hands of Elizabeth, who would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have denied all
concurrence in the deſign, but who would have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to retain him in
perpetual thraldom, if not captivity. The conſpiracy was diſcovered, and
Wotton fled haſtily from Scotland, without taking leave of the King<note n="*" place="bottom">Melvil.</note>.</p>
               <p>JAMES'S ſituation obliged him to diſſemble his
reſentment of this traiterous attempt, and his natural temper inclined him
ſoon to forgive and forget it. The Queen found no difficulty to renew the
negociations for a ſtrict alliance between Scotland and England; and the more
effectually to gain the prince's affections, ſhe granted him a penſion,
equivalent to his claim on the inheritance of his grandmother the counteſs of
Lenox, lately deceaſed<note n="†" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p.
351.</note>. A league was formed between Elizabeth and James, for mutual
defence of their dominions, and of their religion, now menaced by the open
combination of all the catholic powers of Europe. It was ſtipulated, that if
Elizabeth was invaded, James ſhould aid her with a body of two thouſand
horſe and five thouſand foot; that Elizabeth, in a like caſe; ſhould
ſend to his aſſiſtance three thouſand horſe and ſix thouſand
foot; that the charge of theſe armies ſhould be defrayed by the prince who
demanded aſſiſtance; that if the invaſion ſhould be made upon
England, within ſixty miles of the frontiers of Scotland, this latter kingdom
ſhould march its whole forces to the aſſiſtance of the former; and that
the preſent league ſhould ſupercede all former alliances of either
ſtate with any foreign kingdom, ſo far as religion was concerned<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 349. Camden, p. 513. Rymer, tom. XV. p.
803.</note>.</p>
               <p>BY this league James ſecured himſelf againſt all attempts
from abroad, opened a way for acquiring the confidence and affection of the
Engliſh, and might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſome proſpect of domeſtic tranquillity,
which, ſo long as he lived on bad terms with Elizabeth, he could never expect
long to enjoy. Beſides the turbulent diſpoſition, and inveterate feuds of
the nobility, ancient maladies of the Scotch government, the ſpirit of
fanaticiſm had introduced a new diſorder; ſo much the more dangerous,
that religion, when corrupted by falſe opinion, is not reſtrained by any
rules of morality, and is even ſearcely to be accounted for in its
operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by any principles of ordinary conduct and policy. The inſolence
of the Scotch preachers, who triumphed in their dominion over the populace,
had, at <pb n="592" facs="tcp:0429000102:197"/> this time, reached an extreme height; and they
carried their arrogance ſo far, not only againſt the King, but againſt
the Parliament, and the whole civil power, that they dared to excommunicate the
archbiſhop of St. Andrews, becauſe he had been active for promoting a law
which reſtrained their ſeditious ſermons<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 345, 346.</note>: Nor could that prelate ſave
himſelf any way from this terrible ſentence, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all
pretenſions to eccleſiaſtical authority. One Gibſon ſaid in the
pulpit, that captain James Stuart (meaning the late earl of Arran) and his
wife, Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, had been eſteemed the chief perſecutors of the church; but
it was now ſeen, that the King himſelf was the great offender: And for this
crime the preacher denounced againſt him, the curſe which fell on Jeroboam,
that he ſhould die childleſs, and be the laſt of his race<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 344.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE ſecretary, perceiving the King ſo much moleſted with
eccleſiaſtical affairs, and with the refractory diſpoſition of the
clergy, adviſed him to leave them to their own courſes: For that in a
ſhort time they would become ſo intolerable, that the people would riſe
againſt them, and chace them out of the country. 
<q rend="inline">"True," replied the King: "If I purpoſed to

               <p>THE dangers which aroſe from the character, principles, and
pretenſions of the Queen of Scots, had engaged, very early, Elizabeth to
conſult, in her treatment of that unfortunate princeſs, the dictates of
jealouſy and politics, <pb n="593" facs="tcp:0429000102:198"/> rather than of friendſhip or
generoſity: The reſentment of this uſage had puſhed Mary into
enterprizes, which had very nearly threatened the repoſe and authority of
Elizabeth: The rigour and reſtraint, which were thence redoubled upon the
captive Queen<note n="†" place="bottom">Digges, p. 139. Haynes, p.
607.</note>, ſtill impelled her to attempt greater extremities; and while her
impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of confinement, her revenge<note n="*" place="bottom">Mary's extreme
animoſity againſt Elizabeth may eaſily be conceived, and broke out, about
this time, in an incident, which may appear curious. While the former Queen was
kept in cuſtody by the earl of Shrewſbury, ſhe lived during a long time
in great intimacy with the counteſs; but that lady, entertaining jealouſy
of an amour between her and the earl, their friendſhip was converted into
enmity; and Mary took a method of revenge, which at once gratified her ſpite
againſt the counteſs and that againſt Elizabeth. She wrote to the Queen,
informing her of all the malicious ſcandalous ſtories, which, ſhe ſaid,
the counteſs of Shrewſbury had reported of her: That Elizabeth had given a
promiſe of marriage to a certain perſon, whom ſhe afterwards often
admitted to her bed: That ſhe had been equally indulgent to Simier, the
French agent, and to the duke of Anjou: That Hatton was alſo one of her
paramours, who was even diſguſted with her exceſſive love and
fondneſs: That tho' ſhe was on other occaſions avaritious to the laſt
degree, as well as ungrateful, and kind to very few, ſhe ſpared no expence
in gratifying her amorous paſſions: That notwithſtanding her licentious
amours, ſhe was not made like other women; and all thoſe who courted her
marriage would in the end be diſappointed: That ſhe was ſo conceited of
her beauty, as to ſwallow the moſt extravagant flattery from her courtiers,
who could not, on theſe occaſions, forbear even ſneering at her for her
folly: That it was uſual for them to tell her, that the luſtre of her
beauty dazled them like that of the ſun, and they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it with a
fixed eye: She added, that the counteſs had ſaid, that Mary's beſt policy
would be to engage her ſon to make love to the Queen; nor was there any
danger that ſuch a propoſal would be taken for mockery; ſo ridiculous was
the opinion which ſhe had entertained of her own charms. She pretended, that
the counteſs had repreſented her as no leſs odious in her temper than
proſtigate in her manners, and abſurd in her vanity: That ſhe had ſo
beaten a young woman of the name of Scudamore as to break that lady's finger;
and in order to cover over the matter, it was pretended, that the accident had
proceeded from the fall of a candleſtick: That ſhe had cut another acroſs
the hand with a knife, who had been ſo unfortunate as to offend her. Mary
added, that the counteſs had informed her, that Elizabeth had ſuborned
Rolſtone to pretend friendſhip to her, in order to debauch her, and thereby
throw in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Murden's State Papers, p. 558. This imprudent and malicious letter was wrote a
very little before the detection of Queen Mary's conſpiracy; and contributed,
no doubt, to render the proceedings againſt her more rigorous. How far all
theſe imputations againſt Elizabeth can be credited, may perhaps appear
doubtful: But her extreme fondneſs for Leiceſter, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſuſpicious. Her ſelf conceit with regard to beauty, we know from other

The blow the gave to Eſſex before the privy council is another inſtance.
Had this Queen been both in a private ſtation, ſhe would not have been very
amiable: But her abſolute authority, at the ſame time that it gave an
uncontroled ſwing to her violent paſſions, enabled her to compenſate
for her infirmities by many great and ſignal virtues.</note>, and her high
ſpirit concurred with religious <pb n="594" facs="tcp:0429000102:199"/> zeal, and the
ſuggeſtions of deſperate bigots, ſhe was at laſt engaged in
deſigns, which afforded her enemies, who waited for the opportunity, a
pretext or reaſon for effectuating her final ruin.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Zeal of the catholics.</note> THE Engliſh
ſeminary at Rheims had wrought themſelves up to a high pitch of rage and
animoſity againſt the Queen. The recent perſecutions, from which they had
fled: The new rigours, which, they knew, awaited them in the courſe of their
miſſions: The liberty which for the preſent they enjoyed of declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt that princeſs: And the contagion of religious fury, which every
where ſurrounded them in France: All theſe cauſes had obliterated with
them every maxim of common ſenſe, and every principle of morals or
humanity. Intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with admiration of the omnipotence and infallibility of
the pope, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his bull by which he excommunicated and depoſed the
Queen; and ſome of them had gone to that height of extravagance, as to
aſſert, that that perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance had been immediately dictated by the Holy
Ghoſt. The aſſaſſination of heretical ſovereigns, and of that
princeſs in particular, was repreſented as the moſt meritorious of all
enterprizes; and they taught, that whoever periſhed in ſuch pious attempts
enjoyed without diſpute the glorious and never-fading crown of martyrdom. By
ſuch doctrines, they inſtigated John Savage, a man of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate courage,
who had ſerved ſome years in the Low Countries under the prince of Parma,
to attempt the life of Elizabeth; and this aſſaſſin, having made a vow
to perſevere in his deſign, was ſent over to England, and recommended to
the confidence of the more zealous catholics.</p>
               <p>ABOUT the ſame time, John Ballard, a prieſt of that
ſeminary, had returned to Paris from his miſſion in England and Scotland;
and as he had diſcovered a ſpirit of mutiny and rebellion very prevalent
among the catholic devotees in theſe countries, he had founded on that
diſpoſition the project of dethroning Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, and of reſtoring by
force of arms the exerciſe of the antient religion in England<note n="*" place="bottom">Murden's State Papers, p. 517.</note>. The ſituation of affairs
abroad ſeemed favourable to this enterprize: The pope, the Spaniard, the duke
of Guiſe, the prince, created by the pope duke, of Parma, concurring in
intereſts, had formed a reſolution to make ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Queen:
And Mendoza, the Spaniſh ambaſſador at Paris, ſtrongly encouraged
Ballard to hope for ſuccours from theſe princes. Charles Paget alone, a
zealous catholic and a devoted partizan of the Queen of Scots, being well
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the prudence, vigour, and general popularity of Elizabeth,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <pb n="595" facs="tcp:0429000102:200"/> maintained, that ſo long as that princeſs
was allowed to live, it was in vain to expect any ſucceſs from an
enterprize upon England. Ballard, perſuaded of this truth, ſaw more clearly
the neceſſity of executing the deſign, formed at Rheims: He came over to
England in the diſguiſe of a ſoldier, and aſſumed the name of captain
Forteſcue: And he bent his endeavours to effectuate at once the project of an
aſſaſſination, an inſurrection and an invaſion<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 515.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Babington's conſpiracy.</note> THE firſt
perſon, to whom he addreſſed himſelf, was Anthony Babington of Dothic
in the county of Derby. This young gentleman was of a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
poſſeſſed a plentiful fortune, had diſcovered an excellent capacity,
and was accompliſhed in literature beyond moſt of his years or ſtation.
Being zealouſly devoted to the catholic communion, he had ſecretly made a
journey to Paris ſome time before; and had fallen into intimacy with Thomas
Morgan, a bigotted fugitive from England, and with the biſhop of Glaſgow,
Mary's ambaſſador to the court of France. By continually extolling the
amiable accompliſhments and heroical virtues of that princeſs, they
inflamed the unguarded mind of young Babington to make ſome attempt for her
ſervice; and they employed every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ambition, gallantry, and
religious zeal to give him a contempt of thoſe dangers, which attended any
enterprize againſt the vigilant government of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth. Finding him well
diſpoſed for their purpoſe, they ſent him back to England, and
ſecretly, unknown to himſelf, recommended him to the Queen of Scots as a
perſon worth engaging in her ſervice. She wrote him a letter, full of
friendſhip and confidence; and Babington, ſanguine in his temper and
zealous in his principles, thought, that theſe advances now bound him in
honour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote himſelf entirely to the ſervice of that unfortunate
princeſs. During ſome time, he had found means of conveying to her all her
foreign correſpondence; but after ſhe was put under the cuſtody of Sir
Amias Paulet, and reduced to a more rigorous confinement, he experienced ſo
much difficulty and danger in rendering her this ſervice, that he had
deſiſted from every attempt of that nature.</p>
               <p>WHEN Ballard began to open his intentions to Babington, he found
his zeal ſuſpended, not extinguiſhed: His former ardour revived on the
mention of any enterprize, which ſeemed to promiſe ſucceſs in the
cauſe of Mary or of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic religion. He had entertained, however,
ſentiments conformable to thoſe of Paget, and repreſented the ſolly of
all attempts, which, during the life-time of Elizabeth, could be formed
againſt the eſtabliſhed religion and government of England. Ballard,
encouraged by this hint, proceeded to diſcover to him the deſign undertaken
by Savage<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. State Trials, p. 111.</note>; and was
pleaſed to obſerve, that, inſtead of <pb n="596" facs="tcp:0429000102:201"/> being
ſhocked with that project, Babington only thought it not ſecure enough,
when entruſted to one ſingle hand, and propoſed to join four others with
Savage in this deſperate and bloody enterprize.</p>
               <p>IN proſecution of theſe views, Babington employed himſelf
in augmenting the number of his aſſociates; and he ſecretly drew into the
conſpiracy many catholic gentlemen, diſcontented with the preſent
government. Barnwel, of a noble family in Ireland, Charnoc, a gentleman of
Lancaſhire, and Abington, whoſe father had been cofferer to the houſhold,
readily undertook the aſſaſſination of the Queen. Charles Tilney the
heir of a very antient family, and Titchborne of Southampton, when the deſign
was propoſed to them, expreſſed ſome ſcruples, which were at laſt
removed by the arguments of Babington and Ballard. Savage alone refuſed for
ſome time to ſhare the glory of the enterprize with any others<note n="†" place="bottom">State Trials, vol. I. p. 111.</note>; he challenged
the whole to himſelf; and it was with ſome difficulty he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to
depart from this prepoſterous ambition.</p>
               <p>THE delivery of the Queen of Scots, at the very ſame
inſtant, when Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth ſhould be aſſaſſinated, was requiſite
for effecting the purpoſe of the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators; and Babington undertook,
with a party of an hundred horſe, to attack her guards, while ſhe ſhould
be taking the air on horſeback. In this enterprize, he engaged Edward
Windſor, brother to the lord of that name, Thomas Saliſbury, Robert Gage,
John Travers, John Jones, and Henry Donne; moſt of them men of family and
intereſt. The conſpirators much wanted, but could not find, any nobleman of
name, whom they might place at the head of their enterprize; but they
truſted, that the great events, of the Queen's death and Mary's delivery,
would rouze all the zealous catholics to arms; and that foreign forces, taking
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the general confuſion, would eaſily fix the Queen of Scots on
the throne, and re-eſtabliſh the antient religion.</p>
               <p>THESE deſperate projects had not eſcaped the vigilance of
Elizabeth's council, particularly of Walſingham, ſecretary of ſtate. That
artful miniſter had engaged Maud, a catholic prieſt, whom he retained in
pay, to attend Ballard in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to France, and had thereby got a hint of
the deſigns, entertained by the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives. Polly, another of his ſpies,
had found means to inſinuate himſelf among the conſpirators in England;
and tho' not entirely truſted, had obtained ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into their
dangerous ſecrets. But the bottom of the conſpiracy was never fully known,
till Gifford, a ſeminary prieſt, came over, and made a tender of his
ſervice to Walſingham. By his means, the diſcovery became of the utmoſt
importance, <pb n="597" facs="tcp:0429000102:202"/> and involved the fate of Mary, as well as of
thoſe zealous partizans of that princeſs.</p>
               <p>BABINGTON and his aſſociates, having laid ſuch a ſcheme,
as, they thought, promiſed infallible ſucceſs, were impatient to
communicate the deſign to the Queen of Scots, and to obtain her approbation
and concurrence. For this ſervice, they employed Gifford, who immediately
applied to Walſingham, that the intereſt of that miniſter might forward
his ſecret correſpondence with Mary. Walſingham propoſed the matter to
Paulet, and deſired him to connive at Gifford's corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of his
ſervants: But Paulet was averſe to the introducing ſuch a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
precedent into his family, and deſired, that they would rather think of
ſome other expedient. Gifford found a brewer, who ſupplied the family with
ale; and bribed him to convey letters to the captive Queen. The letters, by

               <p>BALLARD and Babington were at firſt diffident of Gifford's
fidelity; and to make trial of him, they gave him only blank papers made up
like letters: But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the anſwers, that theſe had been faithfully
delivered, they laid aſide all farther ſcruple, and conveyed by his hands
the moſt criminal and dangerous parts of their conſpiracy. Babington
informed Mary of the deſign laid for a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign invaſion, the plan of an
inſurrection at home, the ſcheme for her delivery, and the conſpiracy for
aſſaſſinating the uſurper, by ſix noble gentlemen, as he termed
them, all of them his private friends, who, from the zeal, which they bore to
the catholic cauſe and her majeſty's ſervice, would undertake the
tragical execution. 
<note place="margin">Mary aſſents to the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</note>
Mary replied, that ſhe approved highly of the deſign, that the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
might expect all the rewards, which it ſhould ever be in her power to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and that the death of Elizabeth was a requiſite circumſtance,
before any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made either for her own delivery or an
inſurrection<note n="*" place="bottom">State Trials, vol. I. p 135. Camden, p.
515</note>. Theſe letters, with others to Mendoza, Charles Paget, the
archbiſhop of Glaſgow, and Sir Francis Ingelfield, were carried by Gifford
to ſecretary Walſingham; were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered by the art of Philips, his clerk;
and copies taken of them. Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham employed a new artifice, in order to
obtain full inſight into the plot: He ſubjoined to a letter of Mary's a
poſtſcript in the ſame cypher; in which he made her deſire Babington to
inform her of the names of the ſix conſpirators. The indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
Babington furniſhed Walſingham with ſtill another means of detection as
well as of defence. That gentleman had made a picture be drawn, where he
himſelf was repreſented ſtanding amidſt the ſix aſſaſſins;
and a motto was ſubjoined, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, that their common perils were the
band of their conſederacy. A copy <pb n="598" facs="tcp:0429000102:203"/> of this picture was
brought to Elizabeth, that ſhe might know the aſſaſſins, and guard
herſelf againſt their approach to her perſon.</p>
               <p>MEANWHILE, Babington, anxious to enſure and haſten the
foreign ſuccours, reſolved to diſpatch Ballard into France; and he
procured for him, under a feigned name, a licence to travel. In order to remove
from himſelf all ſuſpicion, he applied to Walſingham, pretended great
zeal for the Queen's ſervice, offered to go abroad, and promiſed to employ
that confidence, which he had gained among the catholics, to the detection and
diſappointment of their conſpiracies. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham commended his loyal
purpoſes; and promiſing his own council and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in the
execution of them, ſtill fed him with hopes, and maintained a cloſe
correſpondence with him. A warrant, meanwhile, was iſſued for ſeizing
Ballard; and this incident, joined to the conſciouſneſs of guilt, begot
in all the conſpirators the utmoſt anxiety and concern. Some adviſed that
they ſhould immediately make their eſcape: Others propoſed, that Savage
and Charnoc ſhould without delay execute their purpoſe againſt Elizabeth;
and Babington, in proſecution of this ſcheme, furniſhed Savage with
money, that he might buy good cloaths, and have thereby the more eaſy
acceſs to the Queen's perſon. Next day, they began to apprehend, that they
had taken the alarm too haſtily; and Babington, having renewed his
correſpondence with Walſingham, was perſuaded by that ſubtle
miniſter, that the ſeizure of Ballard had proceeded entirely from the
uſual diligence of informers in the detection of popiſh and ſeminary
prieſts. He even conſented to take ſecretly lodgings in Walſingham's
houſe, that they might have more frequent conferences together, before his
intended departure for France: But obſerving, that he was watched and
guarded, he made his eſcape, and gave the alarm to the other conſpirators.
They all took to flight, covered themſelves with ſeveral diſguiſes, and
lay concealed in woods or barns; 
<note place="margin">The conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſeized and
executed.</note> but were ſoon diſcovered and thrown into priſon. In
their examinations, they contradicted each other; and the leaders were obliged
to make a full confeſſion of the truth. 
<note place="margin">September.</note> Fourteen were condemned and
executed: Of whom, ſeven acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged the crime on their trial; the reſt

               <p>THE leſſer conſpirators being diſpatched, meaſures
were taken for the trial and conviction of the Queen of Scots; on whoſe
account, and by whoſe concurrence, all theſe attempts had been made
againſt the life of the Queen, and the tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the kingdom. Some of
Elizabeth's counſellors were averſe to this proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; and thought, that
the cloſe confinement of a woman, who was become very ſickly, and who would
probably put a ſpeedy end to their anxiety by her natural death, might give
ſufficient ſecurity to the government, without attempting a meaſure of
which there ſcarcely remains any example in hiſtory. Leiceſter
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, <pb n="599" facs="tcp:0429000102:204"/> that Mary ſhould be ſecretly
diſpatched by poiſon; and he ſent a divine to convince Walſingham of
the lawfulneſs of that action: But Walſingham de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his abhorrence of
it; and inſiſted ſtill, in conjunction with the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the
counſellors, for the open trial of the Queen of Scots. The ſituation of
England, and of the Engliſh miniſters had, indeed, been hitherto not a
little dangerous. No ſucceſſor of the crown was declared; but the heir of
blood, to whom the people in general were likely to adhere, was, by education,
an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the national religion; was, from multiplied injuries, an enemy to
the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and principal nobility: And their perſonal ſafety, as well
as the ſecurity of the government, ſeemed to hang alone on the Queen's
life, who was now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what advanced in years. No wonder, therefore, that
Elizabeth's counſellors, knowing themſelves to be ſo obnoxious to the
Queen of Scots, endeavoured to puſh every meaſure to extremity againſt
her; and were even more anxious than the Queen herſelf, to prevent her from
ever mounting the throne of England.</p>
               <p>THO' all England was acquainted with the detection of
Babington's conſpiracy, every avenue to the Queen of Scots was ſo
ſtrictly guarded, that ſhe remained in utter ignorance of the whole matter;
and it was a great ſurprize to her, when Sir Thomas Gorges, by Elizabeth's
orders, informed her, that all her partizans were diſcovered and arreſted.
He choſe the time for giving her this intelligence, when ſhe was mounted on
horſeback to go a hunting; and ſhe was not permitted to return to her
former place of abode, but was conducted from one gentleman's houſe to
another, till ſhe was landed in Fotheringhay caſtle in the county of
Northampton, which it was determined to make the laſt ſtage of her trial
and ſufferings. Her two ſecretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a Scot,
were immediately arreſted: All her papers were ſeized, and ſent up to the
council: Above ſixty different keys to cyphers were diſcovered: There were
alſo found many letters from perſons beyond ſea; and ſeveral too from
Engliſh noblemen, containing expreſſions of reſpect and attachment. The
Queen took no notice of this laſt diſcovery; but the perſons
themſelves, knowing their correſpondence to be detected, thought that they
had no other method of making atonement for their imprudence, than declaring
themſelves thenceforth the moſt inveterate enemies to the Queen of
Scots<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 518.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reſolution to try the Queen of
Scots.</note> IT was reſolved to try Mary, not by the common ſtatutes of
treaſon, but by the act which had paſſed the former year, with a view to
this very event; and the Queen, in terms of that act, appointed a
commiſſion, conſiſting of forty noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and privy-counſellors, and
empowered them to examine and paſs ſentence on <pb n="600" facs="tcp:0429000102:205"/> Mary,
whom ſhe denominated the late Queen of Scots, and heir to James the fifth of
Scotland. The commiſſioners came to Fotheringhay caſtle, and ſent to
her Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Amias Paulet, and Edward Barker, who delivered her
a letter from Elizabeth, informing her of the commiſſion, and of the
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching trial. Mary received the intelligence without any commotion or
aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. She ſaid, however, that it ſeemed ſtrange to her, that
the Queen ſhould command her, as a ſubject, to ſubmit to a trial and
examination before ſubjects: That ſhe was an abſolute independant
princeſs, and would yield to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which might derogate either from her
royal majeſty, from the ſtate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign princes, or from the dignity
and rank of her ſon: That, however op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by misfortunes and
calamities, her ſpirits were not yet ſo much broke, as her enemies
flattered themſelves; nor would ſhe, on any account, be acceſſary to
her own degradation and diſhonour: That ſhe was ignorant of the laws and
ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of England; was utterly deſtitute of council; and could not
conceive who were intitled to be called her peers, or could legally ſit as
judges on her trial: That tho' ſhe had lived in England for many years, ſhe
had lived in captivity; and not having received the protection of the laws,
ſhe could not, merely by her involuntary reſidence in the country, be
ſuppoſed to have ſubjected herſelf to their juriſdiction and
authority: That notwithſtanding the ſuperiority of her rank, ſhe was
willing to give an account of her conduct before an Engliſh Parliament; but
could not view theſe commiſſioners in any other light, than as men
appointed to juſtify, by ſome colour of legal proceeding, her condemnation
and execution: And that ſhe warned them to look to their conſcience and
their character, in trying an innocent perſon; and to reflect, that theſe
tranſactions would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where be ſubject to reviſion, and that the
theatre of the whole world was much wider than the kingdom of England.</p>

deputation, informing her, that her plea, either from her royal dignity or from
her impriſonment, could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and that they were empowered to
proceed againſt her, even tho' ſhe ſhould refuſe to appear before them.
Burleigh, the treaſurer, and Bromley, the chancellor, employed much
reaſoning to make her ſubmit to the trial; but the perſon whoſe
arguments had the chief influence, was Sir Chriſtopher Hatton,
vice-chamberlain. His ſpeech was to this purpoſe. 
<q rend="inline">"You are accuſed, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," ſaid he, "but not

ſuch a ſituation as yours, the royal dignity itſelf, neither by the civil

If you be innocent, you wrong your reputation in avoiding <pb n="601" facs="tcp:0429000102:206"/> a trial. We have been preſent at your proteſtations of
innocence; but Queen Elizabeth thinks otherwiſe; and is heartily ſorry for

ſhe has appointed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, honourable perſons, prudent and

will rejoice if you can clear yourſelf of the imputations which have been
thrown upon you. Believe me, Madam, the Queen herſelf will rejoice, who
affirmed to me at my departure, that nothing which ever befel her, had given
her ſo much uneaſineſs, as that you ſhould be ſuſpected of a

               </p>
               <p>BY this artful ſpeech, Mary was perſuaded to appear before
the court; and thereby gave an appearance of legal procedure to the trial, and
prevented thoſe difficulties, which the commiſſioners muſt have fallen
into, had ſhe perſevered in maintaining ſo ſpecious a plea as that of
her ſovereign and independant character. Her conduct in this particular
muſt be regarded as the more imprudent, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, when Elizabeth's
commiſſioners pretended not to exerciſe any juriſdiction over her, and
only entered into her cauſe by her own conſent and approbation, ſhe
declined juſtifying herſelf, when her honour, which ought to have been
dearer to her than life, ſeemed abſolutely to require it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The trial.</note> ON her firſt appearance
before the commiſſioners, Mary, either ſenſible of her imprudence, or
ſtill unwilling to degrade herſelf by ſubmitting to a trial, renewed her
proteſtation againſt the authority of her judges: The chancellor anſwered
her by pleading the ſupreme authority of the Engliſh laws over every one
who reſided in England: And the commiſſioners accommodated matters, by
ordering both her proteſtation and his anſwer to be recorded.</p>
               <p>THE lawyers of the crown then opened the charge againſt the
Queen of Scots. They proved, by intercepted letters, that ſhe had allowed
cardinal Allen and others to treat her as Queen of England; and that ſhe had
kept a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with lord Paget and Charles Paget, in a view of
engaging the Spaniards to invade the kingdom. Mary ſeemed not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>xious to clear herſelf from either of
theſe imputations. She only ſaid, that ſhe could not hinder others from
uſing what ſtyle they pleaſed in writing to her; and that it was lawful
for her to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy every expedient for the recovery of her liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="602" facs="tcp:0429000102:207"/> AN intercepted letter of her's to Mendoza
was next produced; in which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to transfer to Philip her right
to the kingdom of England, if her ſon ſhould refuſe to be converted to
the catholic faith; an event, ſhe ſaid, of which there was no expectation,
while he remained in the hands of his Scotch ſubjects<note n="*" place="bottom">State Trials, vol. I. p. 138.</note>. Even this part of the
charge, ſhe took no pains to deny, or rather ſhe ſeemed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it. She ſaid, that ſhe had no kingdoms to diſpoſe of; yet was it
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for her to give at her pleaſure what was her own, and ſhe was not
accountable to any for her actions. She added, that ſhe had formerly rejected
that propoſal from Spain, but now, ſince all her hopes in England were
gone, ſhe was fully determined not to refuſe foreign aſſiſtance.
There was alſo produced evidence to prove, that Allen and Parſons were at
that very time negotiating by her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Rome the conditions of
transferring her Engliſh crown to the King of Spain, and of diſinheriting
her heretical ſon<note n="†" place="bottom">Canden, p. 525. This
evidence was that of Curle, her ſecretary, whom ſhe allowed to be a very
honeſt man; and who as well as Nau, had given proofs of his integrity, by
keeping ſo long ſuch important ſecrets, from whoſe diſcovery he could
have reaped the greateſt profit. Mary, after all, thought that ſhe had ſo
little reaſon to complain of Curle's evidence, that ſhe took care to have
him paid a conſiderable ſum by her teſtament, which ſhe wrote the day
before her death. Coodal, vol. I. p. 413. Neither did ſhe forget Nau, tho'
leſs ſatisfied with his conduct. Id. Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT is remarkable, that Mary's prejudices againſt her ſon
were, at this time, carried ſo far, that ſhe had even entered into a
conſpiracy againſt him, had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed lord Claude Hamilton regent of
Scotland, and had inſtigated her adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to ſeize the King's perſon

                     <p>This violence of ſpirit is very conſiſtent with Mary's

deſiſted from that deſign, and entered into an alliance with England,
without comprehending his mother. She was in ſuch a rage at this undutiful
behaviour, as ſhe imagined it, that ſhe wrote to Queen Elizabeth, that
ſhe no longer cared what became of him or her in the world; the greateſt
ſatisfaction ſhe could have before her death was to ſee him and all his
adherents become a ſignal example of tyranny, ingratitude and impiety, and
undergo the vengeance of God for their wickedneſs. She would ſind in
Chriſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom other heirs, and doubted not to put her inheritance in ſuch
hands as would retain the firmeſt hold of it. She cared not, after taking
this revenge, what became of her body: The quickeſt death would then be the
moſt agreeable to her. And ſhe aſſured her, that, if he perſevered,
ſhe would diſown him for her ſon, would give him her malediction, would
diſinherit him, as well of his preſent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as of all he
could expect by her; abandoning him not only to her ſubjects to treat him as
they had done her, but to all ſtrangers to ſubdue and conquer him. It was
in vain to employ menaces againſt her: The fear of death or other misfortune
would never induce her to make one ſtep or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce one ſyllable beyond
what ſhe had determined: She would rather periſh with honour, in
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the dignity, to which God had raiſed her, than degrade herſelf

                  <pb n="603" facs="tcp:0429000102:208"/> THE only part of the charge, which Mary
poſitively denied, was her concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the deſign of
aſſaſſinating Queen Elizabeth: This article indeed was the moſt
heavy, and the only one, which could fully juſtify the Queen in proceeding to
extremities againſt her. In order to prove the accuſation, there were
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the following evidence: Copies taken in ſecretary Walſingham's
office of the intercepted letters between her and Babington, in which her
approbation of the murder was clearly expreſſed; the evidence of her two
ſecretaries, Nau and Curle, who had ſworn, without being put to any
torture, that ſhe both received theſe letters from Babington, and that they
had wrote the anſwers by her order; the confeſſion of Babington, that he
had wrote the letters and received the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers<note n="‡" place="bottom">State Trials, vol. I. p. 113.</note>; and the confeſſion of
Ballard and Savage, that Babington had ſhowed them theſe letters of Mary,
wrote in the cypher, which had been ſettled between them.</p>
               <p>IT is evident, that this ſeeming complication of evidence
reſolves itſelf finally into the teſtimony of the two ſecretaries, who
alone were acquainted with their miſtreſs's concurrence in Babington's
conſpiracy, and who knew themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all the rigours of
impriſonment, torture and death, if they refuſed to give any evidence,
which might be required of them. In the caſe of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary 
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:0429000102:209"/> criminal, this proof, with all its diſadvantages,
would be eſteemed legal, and even ſatisfactory, if not oppoſed by ſome
other circumſtances, which ſhake the credit of the witneſſes: But on
the preſent trial, where the abſolute power of the proſecutor concurred
with ſuch important intereſts and ſuch a ſtrong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to have
the princeſs condemned; the teſtimony of two witneſſes, even tho' men
of character, ought to be ſupported by very ſtrong circumſtances, in
order to remove all ſuſpicion of tyranny and injuſtice. The proof
againſt Mary, it muſt be confeſſed, is not deſtitute of this
advantage; and it is very difficult, if not impoſſible, to account for
Babington's receiving an anſwer, wrote in her name, and in the cypher
concerted between them, without allowing, that the matter had been communicated
to that princeſs. Such is the light in which this matter appears, even after
time has diſcovered every thing, which could guide our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with regard
to it: No wonder, therefore, that the Queen of Scots, unaſſiſted by
council, and confounded by ſo extraordinary a trial, found herſelf
incapable of making a ſatisfactory defence before the commiſſioners. Her
reply conſiſted chiefly in her own denial: Whatever force may be in that
denial was much weakened, by her poſitively affirming, that ſhe never had
had any correſpondence of any kind with Babington; a fact, however, of which
there remains not the leaſt queſtion<note n="*" place="bottom">The volume of
State Papers collected by Mr. Murden, prove beyond controverſy, that Mary was
long in cloſe correſpondence with Babington, p. 513, 516, 532, 533. She
entertained a like cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Ballard, Morgan, and Charles Paget,
and laid a ſcheme with them for an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and for the invaſion of
England by Spain, p. 528, 531. The ſame papers ſhow, that there had been a
diſcontinuance of Babington's correſpondence, agreeable to Camden's
narration. See State Papers p 513, where Morgan recommends it to Queen Mary to
renew the correſpondence with Babington. The former letters, which paſſed
between that Queen and Babington, ſeem to have been deſtroyed by ſome
accident. Theſe circumſtances prove, that no weight can be laid on Mary's
denial of guilt, and that her correſpondence with Babington contained
particulars, which could not be avowed.</note>. She aſſerted, that as Nau
and Curle had taken an oath of ſecrecy and fidelity to her, their evidence
againſt her ought not to be credited. She confeſſed, however, that Nau
had been in the ſervice of her uncle, the cardinal of Lorraine, and had been
recommended to her by the King of France, as a man in whom ſhe might ſafely
confide. She alſo acknowleged Curle to be a very honeſt man, but ſimple,
and eaſily impoſed on by Nau. If theſe two men had received any letters,
or had wrote any anſwers, without her knowlege; the imputation, ſhe ſaid,
could never lie on her. And ſhe was the more inclined, ſhe added, to
enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this ſuſpicion againſt them, that Nau had, in other
inſtances, been guilty of a <pb n="605" facs="tcp:0429000102:210"/> like temerity, and had
ventured to tranſact buſineſs in her name, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the
matter to her<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>There are three ſuppoſitions, by which the letter to
Babington may be accounted for, without allowing Mary's concurrence in the
conſpiracy for aſſaſſinating Elizabeth. The firſt is, that which
ſhe ſeems herſelf to have embraced, that her ſecretaries had received
Babington's letter, and had ventured of themſelves to anſwer it, without
communicating the matter to her: But it is utterly improbable, that a
princeſs of that ſenſe and ſpirit would, in an affair of that
importance, be ſo treated by her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who lived in the houſe with
her, and who had every moment an opportunity of communicating the ſecret to
her. If the conſpiracy failed, they muſt expect to ſuffer the
ſevereſt puniſhment from the court of England; if it ſucceeded, the
lighteſt puniſhment, which they could hope for from their own miſtreſs,
muſt be diſgrace, on account of their temerity. Not to mention, that Mary's
concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was in ſome degree requiſite for effectuating the deſign of
her eſcape: It was propoſed to attack her guards, while ſhe was employed
in hunting: She muſt therefore concert the time and place with the
conſpirators. The ſecond ſuppoſition is, that theſe two ſecretaries
were previouſly traitors; and being gained by Walſingham, had made ſuch a
reply in their miſtreſs's cypher, as might involve her in the guilt of the
conſpiracy. But theſe two men had lived long with the Queen of Scots, had
been entirely truſted by her, and had never fallen under ſuſpicion either
with her or her partizans. Camden tells us, that Curle afterwards claimed a
reward from Walſingham on pretence of ſome promiſe; but Walſingham told
him, that he owed him no reward, and that he had made no diſcoveries on his
exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, which were not known with certainty from other quarters. The
third ſuppoſition is, that neither the Queen nor the two ſecretaries, Nau
and Curle, ever ſaw Babington's letter, or made any anſwer; but that
Walſingham, having decyphered the former, forged a reply. But this
ſuppoſition implies the falſhood of the whole ſtory, told by Camden, of
Gifford's acceſs to the Queen of Scots's family, and Paulet's reſuſal to
concur in allowing his ſervants to be bribed. Not to mention, that as Nau's
and Curle's evidence muſt, on this ſuppoſition, have been extorted by
violence and terror, they would neceſſarily have been engaged, for their
own juſtification, to have told the truth afterwards; eſpecially upon the
acceſſion of James. But Camden informs us, that Nau, even after that event,
perſiſted ſtill in his teſtimony.</p> 
                     <p>We muſt alſo conſider, that the two laſt
ſuppoſitions imply ſuch a monſtrous criminal conduct in Walſingham,
and conſequently in Elizabeth (for the matter could be no ſecret to her) as
exceeds all credibility. If we conſider the ſituation of things and the
prejudices of the times, Mary's conſent to Babington's conſpiracy appears
much more natural and probable. She believed Elizabeth to be an uſurper and a
heretic: She regarded her as a perſonal and a violent enemy: She knew that
ſchemes of aſſaſſinating heretics were very familiar in that age, and
generally approved of by the zealous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics: Her own liberty and
ſovereignty were connected with the ſucceſs of this enterprize: And it
cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ppear ſtrange, that where
men of ſo much merit as Babington could be engaged, by bigotry alone, in ſo
criminal an enterprize, Mary, who was actuated by the ſame motive, joined to
ſo many others, ſhould have given her conſent to a ſcheme projected by
her friends. We may be previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly certain, that, if ſuch a ſcheme was
ever communicated to her, with any probability of ſucceſs, ſhe would
aſſent to it: And it ſerved the purpoſe of Walſingham and the
Engliſh miniſtry to facilitate the communication of theſe ſchemes, as
ſoon as they had got an expedient ſor intercepting her anſwer, and
detecting the conſpiracy. Now Walſingham's knowlege of the matter is a
ſuppoſition neceſſary to account for the letter delivered to
Babington.</p> 
                     <p>As to the not puniſhing of Nau and Curle by Elizabeth, it
never is the practice to puniſh leſſer criminals, who had given evidence
againſt the principal.</p> 
                     <p>But what ſhould induce us to reject theſe three
ſuppoſitions, is, that they muſt, all of them, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as bare
poſſibilities: The partizans of Mary can give no reaſon for preferring
one to the other: Not the ſlighteſt evidence ever appeared to ſupport any
one of them: Neither at that time, nor at any time after, was any reaſon
diſcovered, by the numerous zealots at home and abroad who had embraced
Mary's defence, to lead us to the belief oſ any of theſe three
ſuppoſitions; and even her apologiſts at preſent ſeem not to have
fixed on any choice among theſe ſuppoſed poſſibilities. The
poſitive proof of two credible witneſſes, ſupported by the other very
ſtrong circumſtances, ſtill remains unimpeached. Babington, who had an
extreme intereſt to have communication with the Queen of Scots, believed he
had found a means of correſpondence with her, and had received an anſwer
from her: He, as well as the other conſpirators, died in that belief: There
has not occurred, ſince that time, the leaſt argument to prove they were
miſtaken: Can there be any reaſon at preſent to doubt of the truth of
their opinion? Camden, tho' a profeſt apologiſt for Mary, is conſtrained
to tell the ſtory in ſuch a manner as evidently ſuppoſes her guilt.
Such was the impoſſibility of ſinding any other conſiſtent account,
even by a man of parts, who was a contemporary!</p> 
                     <p>In this light might the queſtion have appeared even during
Mary's trial. But what now puts her guilt beyond all controverſy is the
following paſſage of her letter to Thomas Morgan, dated the 27th of July
1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<q rend="inline">"As to Babington, he hath both kindly and
honeſtly offered himſelf and all his means to be employed any way I would.

ſince I had his; and the rather, for that I opened him the way, whereby I
received his with your aforeſaid."</q> Murden, p. 533. Babington
confeſſed, that he had offered her to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate the Queen: It
appears by this, that ſhe had accepted the offer: So that all the
ſuppoſitions of Walſingham's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

ground.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>THE ſole circumſtance of her defence, which to us may appear
to have ſome force, was her requiring that Nau and Curle ſhould be
confronted with her, and <pb n="606" facs="tcp:0429000102:211"/> affirming that they never would
to her face perſiſt in their evidence. But that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, however equitable,
was not ſupported by law in trials of high treaſon, and was often refuſed
even in other trials where the crown was proſecutor. The clauſe, contained
in an act of the 13th of the Queen, was a novelty; that the ſpecies of
treaſon there enumerated muſt be proved by two witneſſes, confronted
with the criminal<note n="*" place="bottom">The law of 5 &amp; 6 of Edward VI.
cap. 11. which required the confrontation of two witneſſes for all
ſpecies of treaſon was repealed in the firſt of Mary.</note>. But Mary
was not tried upon that act; and the miniſters and crown lawyers of this
reign were always ſure to refuſe every indulgence beyond what the ſtrict
letter of the law and the ſettled practice of the courts of juſtice
required of them. Not to mention, that theſe ſecretaries were not probably
at Fotherin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay during the time of the trial, and could not, upon Mary's
demand, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the commiſſioners<note n="†" place="bottom">Queen Elzabeth was willing to have allowed Curle and Nau to be

                  <pb n="607" facs="tcp:0429000102:212"/> THERE paſſed two incidents in this
trial, which may be worth obſerving. A letter between Mary and Babington was
read, in which mention was made of the earl of Arundel and his brothers: On
hearing their names ſhe broke into a ſigh, 
<q rend="inline">"Alas," ſaid ſhe, "what has that noble
houſe of the Howards ſuffered for my ſake!"</q> She affirmed, with regard
to the ſame letter, that it was eaſy to forge the hand-writing and cypher
of another; ſhe was afraid, that this was too familiar a practice with
Walſingham, who, ſhe alſo heard, had frequently prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed both
againſt her life and her ſon's. Walſingham, who was one of the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, roſe up when he heard this accuſation. He proteſted,
that in his private capacity, he had never acted any thing againſt the Queen
of Scots: In his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic capacity, he owned, that his concern for his
ſovereign's ſafety had made him very diligent in ſearching out, by every
expedient, all deſigns againſt her ſacred perſon or her authority. For
attaining that end, he would not only make uſe of the aſſiſtance of
Ballard or any other conſpirator: He would alſo reward them for betraying
their companions. But if he had tampered in any manner, unworthy of his
character and office, why did none of the late criminals either at their trial
or execution, accuſe him of ſuch practices? Mary endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to pacify him
by ſaying that ſhe ſpoke from information; and ſhe begged him, that he
would thenceforth give no more credit to ſuch as ſtandered her, than ſhe
would to ſuch as accuſed him. The great character indeed, which Sir Francis
Walſingham bears for probity and honour, ſhould remove from him all
ſuſpicion of ſuch baſe arts as forgery and ſubornation; arts, which
even the moſt corrupt miniſters in the moſt corrupt times would ſcruple
to employ.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">25th October.</note> HAVING finiſhed the
trial, the commiſſioners adjourned from Fotheringay, and met in the
Star-Chamber at London; where, after taking the oaths of Mary's two
ſecretaries, who, voluntarily, without hope or reward, vouched the
authenticity of thoſe letters before produced, they pronounced ſentence of
death upon the Queen of Scots, and confirmed it by their ſeals and
ſubſcriptions. 
<note place="margin">Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mary.</note> The ſame
day, a declaration was publiſhed by the commiſſioners and the judges, 
<q rend="inline">"that the ſentence did no way derogate from
the title and honour of James, King of Scotland; but that he was in the ſame
place, degree, and right, as if the ſentence had never been pronounced<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 526.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Queen had now brought her affairs with Mary to that
ſituation, which ſhe had long ardently deſired; and had ſound a
plauſible reaſon for executing vengeance on a competitor, whom, from the
beginning of her reign, ſhe had <pb n="608" facs="tcp:0429000102:213"/> ever equally dreaded
and hated. But ſhe was reſtrained from gratifying inſtantly her
reſentment, by ſeveral important conſiderations. She foreſaw the
invidious colours in which this example of uncommon juriſdiction would be
repreſented by the numerous partizans of Mary, and the reproach, to which
ſhe herſelf might be expoſed with all foreign princes, perhaps with all
poſterity. The rights of hoſpitality, of kindred, and of royal majeſty,
ſeemed in one ſignal inſtance to be all violated; and this ſacrifice of
generoſity to intereſt, of clemency to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, might appear equally
unbecoming a ſovereign and a woman. Elizabeth, therefore, who was an
excellent hypocrite, pretended the utmoſt reluctance to proceed to the
execution of the ſentence, affected the moſt tender ſympathy with her
priſoner, diſplayed all her ſcruples and objections, rejected the
ſollicitation of her courtiers and miniſters, and affirmed, that, were
ſhe not moved by the deepeſt concern for her people's ſafety, ſhe would
not heſitate a moment in pardoning all the injuries, which ſhe herſelf
had received from the Queen of Scots.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">29th October.</note> THAT the voice of her
people might be more audibly heard in the demand of juſtice upon Mary, ſhe
ſummoned a new Parliament; and ſhe knew, both from the uſual
diſpoſitions of that aſſembly, and from the influence of her
miniſters over them, that ſhe ſhould not want the moſt earneſt
ſollicitation to conſent to that meaſure, which was ſo agreeable to her
ſecret inclinations. She opened not this aſſembly in perſon, but
appointed for that purpoſe three commiſſioners, the chancellor Bromley,
the treaſurer Burleigh, and the earl of Derby. The reaſon aſſigned for
this meaſure, was, that the Queen, foreſeeing that the affair of the Queen
of Scots would be tried in Parliament, found her tenderneſs and delicacy ſo
much hurt by that melancholy incident, that ſhe had not the courage to be
preſent while it was under deliberation, but withdrew her eyes from what
ſhe could not behold without the utmoſt reluctance and uneaſineſs. She
was alſo willing, that, by this unuſual caution, the people ſhould ſee
the danger, to which her perſon was hourly expoſed; and ſhould thence be
more ſtrongly incited to take vengeance on the criminal, whoſe reſtleſs
intrigues and bloody conſpiracies had ſo long expoſed her to the moſt
imminent perils<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 375.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Parliament anſwered the Queen's expectations: The
ſentence againſt Mary was unanimouſly ratiſied by both houſes; and an
application was agreed on to obtain Elizabeth's conſent to its publication
and execution<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 379.</note>. She gave
them an anſwer ambiguous, embarraſſed; full of real artifice, and
ſeeming irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. She mentioned the extreme danger to which her life
was continually expoſed; ſhe declared her willingneſs to die, did ſhe
not foreſee the great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, <pb n="609" facs="tcp:0429000102:214"/> which would thence
fall upon the nation; ſhe made profeſſions of the greateſt tenderneſs
to her people; ſhe diſplayed the clemency of her temper, and expreſſed
her violent reluctance to proceed to extremity againſt her unhappy
kinſwoman; ſhe affirmed, that the late law, by which that princeſs was
tried, ſo far from being made to enſnare her, was only intended to give her
warning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, not to engage in ſuch attempts, as might expoſe her to
the penalties, with which ſhe was thus openly menaced; and ſhe begged them
to think once again, whether it was poſſible to find any other expedient
beſides the death of the Queen of Scots for ſecuring the public
tranquillity<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 402, 403.</note>. The
Parliament, in obedience to her commands, took the affair again under
deliberation; but could find no other poſſible expedient. They reiterated
their ſollicitations and entreaties and arguments: They even remonſtrated,
that mercy to the Queen of Scots was cruelty to them, her ſubjects and
children: And they affirmed, that it were injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to deny execution of the
law to any individual; much more, to the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the people, now
unanimouſly and earneſtly ſuing for this pledge of her paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal care and
tenderneſs. This ſecond addreſs ſet the pretended doubts and ſcruples
of Elizabeth anew in agitation: She complained of her own unfortunate
ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; expreſſed her uneaſineſs from their importunity; renewed
the profeſſions of affection to her people; and diſmiſſed the
committee of Parliament in an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, what, after all this deliberation,
might be her final reſolution<note n="†" place="bottom">

for any member of the ſame here aſſembled, freely and without
controulment of any perſon or danger of laws, by bill or ſpeech to utter
any of the griefs of this commonwealth whatſoever touching the ſervice of
God, the ſafety of the prince and this noble realm? Whether that great honour
may be done unto God, and benefit and ſervice unto the prince and ſtate,
without free ſpeech in this council that may be done with it? Whether there
be any council which can make, add, or diminiſh from the laws of the realm
but only this council of Parliament? Whether it be not againſt the orders of
this council to make any ſecret or matter of weight, which is here in hand
known to the prince or any other, concerning the high ſervice of God, prince
or ſtate, without the conſent of the houſe? Whether the ſpeaker or any
other may interrupt any member of this council in his ſpeech uſed in this
houſe tending to any of the forenamed ſervices? Whether the ſpeaker may
riſe when he will, any matter being propounded, without conſent of the
houſe or not? Whether the ſpeaker may over-rule the houſe in any matter
or cauſe there in queſtion, or whether he is to be ruled or over-ruled in
any matter or not? Whether the prince and ſtate can continue, and ſtand,
and be maintained without this council of Parliament, not altering the
government of the ſtate? At the end of theſe queſtions, ſays Sir Simon
D'Ewes, I found ſet down this ſhort note or memorial enſuing: By which it
may be perceived, both what ſerjeant Puc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering, the ſpeaker, did with the
ſaid queſtions after he had received them, and what became alſo of this
buſineſs, viz. 
<q rend="inline">"Theſe queſtions Mr. Puckering pocketed
up and ſhewed Sir Thomas Heneage, who ſo handled the matter, that Mr.
Wentworth went to the Tower, and the queſtions not at all moved. Mr. Buckler
of Eſſex herein brake his ſaith in forſaking the matter, &amp;c. and no
more was done"</q> After ſetting down, continues Sir Simon D'Ewes, the ſaid
buſineſs of Mr. Wentworth in the original journal book, there follows only
this ſhort-concluſion of the day itſelf, viz. 
<q rend="inline">"This day, Mr. Speaker being ſent for to

and Mr. Bainbrigg were ſent for to my lord chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and by divers of the
privy council, and from thence were ſent to the Tower. On Saturday, the
fourth day of March, Sir John Higham made a motion to this houſe, for that
divers good and neceſſary members thereof were taken from them, that it
would pleaſe them to be humble petitioners to her majeſty ſon the
reſſitution of them again to the houſe. To which ſpeeches Mr.
vice-chamberlain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it the gentlemen were committed for matter
within the compaſs of the privilege of this houſe, then there might be a
petition; but if not, then we ſhould give occaſion to her majeſty's
farther diſpleaſure: And therefore adviſed to ſtay until they heard
more, which could not be long: And farther, he ſaid touching the book and the
petition, her majeſty had for diverſe good cauſes, beſt known to
herſelf, thought ſit to ſuppreſs the ſame, without any farther
examination thereof; and yet thought it very unſit for her majeſty to give
any account of her doings.—But whatſoever Mr. vice-chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
pretended, it is moſt probable theſe members were committed for
intermeddling with matters touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the church, which her majeſty had often
inhibited, and which had cauſed ſo much diſputation and ſo many
meetings between the two houſes the laſt Parliament."</p> 
                     <p>This is all we find of the matter in Sir Simon D'Ewes and
Townſend; and it appears that thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who had been committed, were
detained in cuſtody till the Queen thought ſit to releaſe them. Theſe
queſtions of Mr. Wentworth are curious; becauſe they contain the firſt
faint dawnings of the preſent Engliſh conſtitution; tho' ſuddenly
eclipſed by the arbitrary government of Elizabeth. Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth was indeed, by
his puritaniſm, as well as his love of liberty (for theſe two characters,
of ſuch unequal merit, aroſe and advanced together) the true forerunner of
the Hambdens, the Pyms, and the Holliſes, who, in the next age, with leſs
courage, becauſe with leſs danger, rendered their principles ſo
triumphant. I ſhall only aſk, whether it be not ſufficiently clear from
all theſe tranſactions, that in the two ſucceeding reigns it was the
people who encroached upon the ſovereign; not the ſovereign

execute the ſentence againſt Mary, ſhe complied with the Parliament's
requeſt to publiſh it; and the proclamation <pb n="611" facs="tcp:0429000102:216"/> ſeemed
to be attended with the unanimous and hearty rejoicings of the people. The lord
Buckhurſt, and Beale, clerk to the council, were ſent to the Queen of
Scots, and notified to her the ſentence pronounced againſt her, its
ratification by Parliament, and the earneſt applications made for its
execution by that aſſembly, who thought, that their religion could never,
while ſhe was alive, attain a full ſettlement and ſecurity. Mary was no
way diſmayed at this intelligence: On the contrary, ſhe joyfully laid hold
of the laſt circumſtance mentioned to her; and inſiſted, that ſince
her death was demanded by the proteſtants for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their
faith, ſhe was really a martyr to her religion, and was intitled to all the
merits, attending that glorious character. She added, that the Engliſh had
often imbrued their hands in the blood of their ſovereigns: No wonder, they
exerciſed cruelty towards her, who derived her deſcent from theſe
monarchs<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 528.</note>. Paulet, her keeper,
received orders to take down her canopy, and to ſerve her no longer with that
reſpect, due to ſovereign princes. He told her, that ſhe was now to be
conſidered as a dead perſon; and incapable of any dignity<note n="†" place="bottom">Jebb, vol. II. p. 293</note>. This inſult ſhe received without
any ſeeming emotion. She only replied, that ſhe received her royal
character from the hands of the Almighty, and no earthly power was ever able to
bereave her of it.</p>
               <p>THE Queen of Scots wrote her laſt letter to Elizabeth; full of
dignity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departing from that ſpirit of meekneſs and of charity,
which appeared ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this concluding ſcene of her unfortunate life.
She preferred no petition <pb n="612" facs="tcp:0429000102:217"/> for averting the fatal
ſentence: On the contrary, ſhe expreſſed her gratitude to heaven for
thus bringing to a ſpeedy period her ſad and lamentable pilgrimage. She
requeſted ſome favours of Elizabeth, and entreated her, that ſhe might be
beholden for them to her own goodneſs alone, without making applications to
thoſe miniſters, who had diſcovered ſuch an extreme antipathy to her
perſon and her religion. She deſired, that, after her enemies ſhould be
ſatiated with her innocent blood, her body, which, it was determined,
ſhould never enjoy reſt, while her ſoul was united to it, might be
conſigned to her ſervants, and be conveyed by them into France, there to
repoſe in a catholic land, with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred relicts of her mother. In
Scotland, ſhe ſaid, the ſepulchres of her anceſtors were violated, and
the churches either demoliſhed or profaned; and in England, where ſhe might
be interred among the antient kings, her own and Elizabeth's progenitors, ſhe
could entertain no hopes of being accompanied to the grave with thoſe rites
and ceremonies, which her religion required. She deſired that no one might
have the power of inflicting a private death upon her, without Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's
knowlege; but that her execution ſhould be public, and attended with her
antient ſervants, who might bear teſtimony of her perſeverance in the
faith, and of her ſubmiſſion to the will of heaven. She begged, that
theſe ſervants might afterwards be allowed to depart whither they
pleaſed, and might enjoy thoſe legacies which ſhe ſhould leave them.
And ſhe conjured her to grant theſe favours, by their near kindred, by the
ſoul and memory of Henry the ſeventh, the common anceſtor of both, and by
the royal dignity of which they equally participated<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 529. Jebb, vol. II. p. 295.</note>. Elizabeth made no
anſwer to this letter; being unwilling to give Mary a refuſal in her
preſent ſituation, and foreſeeing inconveniencies from grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome
of her requeſts.</p>
               <p>WHILE the Queen of Scots thus prepared herſelf to meet her
fate, great efforts were made by foreign powers with Elizabeth to prevent the
execution of the ſentence, pronounced againſt her. Beſides employing
L'Aubeſpine, the French reſident at London, a man devoted to the houſe of
Guiſe, Henry ſent over Bellievre, with a profeſſed intention of
interceding for the life of Mary. The duke of Guiſe and the league, at that
time, threatened very nearly the King's authority; and Elizabeth knew, that,
tho' that monarch might, from decency and policy, think himſelf obliged to
interpoſe publicly in behalf of the Queen of Scots, he could not ſecretly
be much diſpleaſed with the death of a princeſs, on whoſe fortune and
elevation his mortal enemies had always founded ſo many da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing and ambitious projects<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 494.</note>. It is even pretended, that
Bellievre <pb n="613" facs="tcp:0429000102:218"/> had orders, after making public and vehement
remonſtrances againſt the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Mary, to exhort privately the
Queen, in his maſter's name, not to defer an act of juſtice, ſo
neceſſary for their common intereſts<note n="*" place="bottom">Du
Maurier.</note>. But whether the French King's interceſſion was ſincere
or not, it had no weight with the Queen; and ſhe ſtill perſiſted in her
former reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Interpoſition of King James</note> THE
interpoſition of the young King of Scots, tho' it was not able to change
Elizabeth's determination, ſeemed, on every account, to merit more
atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So ſoon as James heard of the trial and condemnation of his
mother, he ſent William Keith, gentleman of his bed chamber, to London; and
wrote a letter to the Queen, in which he remonſtrated, in very ſevere
terms, againſt the indignity of the procedure. He ſaid, that he was
aſtoniſhed to hear of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Engliſh noblemen and
councellors, who had dared to ſit in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and paſs ſentence upon a
Queen of Scotland, deſcended from the royal blood of England; but was ſtill
more aſtoniſhed to hear, that thoughts were ſeriouſly entertained of
putting that ſentence in execution: That he entreated Elizabeth to reflect on
the diſhonour, which ſhe would draw on her name, by embruing her hands in
the blood of her near kinſwoman, a perſon of the ſame royal dignity and
the ſame ſex with herſelf: That in this unparalelled attempt, ſhe
offered an affront to all diadems, and even to her own; and by reducing
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns to a level with other men, taught the people to neglect all duty
towards thoſe whom Providence had appointed to rule over them: That for his
part, he muſt eſteem the injury and inſult ſo enormous, as to be
incapable of all attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor was it poſſible for him thenceforth to
remain on any terms of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with a perſon, who, without any
pretence of legal authority, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately inflicted an ignominious death
upon his parent: And that even if the ſentiments of nature and duty did not
inſpire him with this purpoſe of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his own honour required it of
him; nor could he ever acquit himſelf in the eyes of the world, if he did not
uſe every effort, and endure every hazard, to revenge ſo great an
indignity<note n="†" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 351.</note>. Soon
after, James ſent the maſter of Gray and Sir Robert Melvil to enforce the
remonſtrances of Keith; and to employ with the Queen every expedient of
argument and menaces. Elizabeth was at firſt offended with ſharpneſs of
theſe applications; and ſhe replied in a like ſtrain to the Scotch
ambaſſadors. When ſhe afterwards reflected, that this earneſtneſs was
no more than what duty required of James, ſhe was pacified; but retained
ſtill her reſolution of proceeding to extremities againſt Mary<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 353.</note>. It is believed, that the
maſter of Gray, gained by the enemies of that princeſs, gave ſecretly his
advice not to ſpare her, and undertook at all adventures to pacify his
maſter. <pb n="614" facs="tcp:0429000102:219"/> The Queen alſo, from many circumſtances,
was induced to pay ſmall attention to the applications of James, and to
diſregard all the efforts, which he could em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in behalf of his mother.
She was well acquainted with his character and intereſts, the factions which
prevailed among his people, and the inveterate hatred, which the zealous
proteſtants, particularly the preachers, bore to the Queen of Scots. The
preſent incidents put theſe diſpoſitions of the clergy in a full light.
James, obſerving the fixed purpoſe of Elizabeth, ordered prayers to be
offered up for his mother in all the churches; and knowing the captious humour
of the eccleſiaſtics, he took care that the form of the petition ſhould
be moſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, as well as humane and charitable: 
<q rend="inline">"That it might pleaſe God to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Mary
with the light of his truth, and ſave her from the apparent danger with which
ſhe was threatened."</q> But excepting the King's own chaplains, and one
clergyman more, all the preachers refuſed to pollute their churches by
pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for a papiſt, and would not ſo much as prefer a petition for her
converſion. James, unwilling or unable to puniſh this diſobedience, and
deſirous of giving the preachers an opportunity of amending their fault,
appointed a new day when prayers ſhould be ſaid for his mother; and that he
might at leaſt ſecure himſelf from any inſult in his own preſence, he
deſired the archbiſhop of St. Andrews to preach before him. In order to
diſappoint this purpoſe, the clergy inſtigated one Couper, a young man,
who had not yet received holy orders, to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the pulpit
early in the morning, and to exclude the prelate. When the King came to church,
and ſaw the pulpit occupied by Couper, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him from his ſeat, and
told him, that the place was deſtined for another; yet ſince he was there,
if he would obey the charge given, and remember the Queen in his prayers, he
might proceed to divine ſervice. The preacher replied, that he would do as
the ſpirit of God ſhould direct him. This anſwer ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
inſtructed James in his purpoſe; and he commanded him to leave the pulpit:
As Couper ſeemed not diſpoſed to obey, the captain of the guard went to
pull him from his place; upon which the young man cried aloud, that this day
would be a witneſs againſt the King in the great day of the Lord; and he
denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of Edinburgh for permitting him to be
treated in that manner<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 354.</note>. The
audience at firſt appeared deſirous to take part with him; but the ſermon
of the prelate brought them over to a more dutiful and more humane
diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH, when ſollicited, either by James or by foreign
princes, to pardon the Queen of Scots, ſeemed always determined to proceed to
extremities againſt her: But when her miniſters urged her to interpoſe no
more delays in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <pb n="615" facs="tcp:0429000102:220"/> her ſcruples and her
heſitation returned; her humanity could not allow her to embrace ſuch
violent and ſanguinary meaſures; and ſhe was touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for the misfortunes, and with reſpect for the dignity of the unhappy
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. The courtiers, ſenſible that they could do nothing more
acceptable to her, than to employ perſuaſion on this head, failed not to
enforce every motive for the puniſhment of the Queen of Scots, and to combat
all the objections urged againſt that act of juſtice. 
<note place="margin">Reaſons for the execution of Mary.</note>
They ſaid, that the treatment of that princeſs in England had been, on her
firſt reception, ſuch as ſound reaſon and policy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and if
ſhe had been governed by principles of equity, ſhe would not have refuſed
willingly to acquieſce in it: That the obvious inconveniencies, either of
allowing her to retire into France, or of reſtoring her by force to her
throne, in oppoſition to the proteſtants, and the Engliſh party in
Scotland, had obliged the Queen to detain her in England, till time ſhould
offer ſome opportunity of ſerving her, without danger to the kingdom, or to
the proteſtant religion: That her uſage had there been ſuch as became her
rank; her own ſervants, in conſiderable numbers, had been permitted to
attend her; exerciſe had been allowed her for her health, and all acceſs of
company for amuſement; and theſe indulgencies would, in time, have been
carried farther, if by her ſubſequent conduct ſhe had appeared worthy of
them: That after ſhe had inſtigated the rebellion of Northumberland, the
conſpiracy of Norfolk, the bull of excommunication of pope Pius, an
invaſion from Flanders; after ſhe had ſeduced the Queen's friends, and
incited every ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, foreign or domeſtic, againſt her; it became
neceſſary to treat her as a moſt dangerous rival, and to render her
confinement more ſtrict and rigorous: That the Queen, notwithſtanding

hopes of her amendment, determined to delay coming to the laſt extremity

and unconquerable a ſpirit, that ſhe acted as competitor to the crown, and
allowed her partizans every where, and in their very letters, addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
herſelf, to treat her as Queen of England: That ſhe had carried her
animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſo far as to encourage the atrocious deſign of
aſſaſſinating the Queen; and this crime was unqueſtionably proved
upon her, by her own letters, by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of her ſecretaries, and by the
dying confeſſion of her accomplices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That ſhe was but a titular
Queen, and at preſent poſſeſſed no where any right of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty;
much leſs in England, where every one was ſubject to the laws, and to
Elizabeth, the only true ſovereign: That even allowing her to be ſtill the
Queen's equal in rank and dignity, ſelf-defence was permitted by a law of
nature, <pb n="616" facs="tcp:0429000102:221"/> which could never be abrogated; and every one,
ſtill more a Queen, had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient juriſdiction over an enemy, who by
open violence, and ſtill more, who by ſecret treachery, threatned the
utmoſt danger againſt her life: That the general combination of the

the ſole reſource of the latter perſecuted ſect lay in Elizabeth, ſo
the chief hope which the former entertained of final ſucceſs, conſiſted
in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in the title of the Queen of Scots: That this very
circumſtance brought matters to extremity between theſe princeſſes, and
rendering the life of the one the death of the other, pointed out to Elizabeth
the path, which either regard to ſelf-preſervation, or to the happineſs
of her people, ſhould direct her to follow: And that neceſſity, more

many importunities had been uſed, and as much delay interpoſed, as decency
required, ſhe was at laſt determined to carry the ſentence into

diſplaying a new ſcene of duplicity and artifice. In order to alarm the
vulgar, rumours were previouſly diſperſed, that the Spaniſh fleet was

that the duke of Guiſe was landed in Suſſex with a ſtrong army; that

even imputed to L'Aubeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, the French ambaſſador; and that miniſter
was obliged to leave the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Queen, affecting to be in great terror

She at laſt called Daviſon, a man of parts, but eaſy to be impoſed on,

ordered him, to draw out ſecretly a warrant for the execution of the Queen of

Dr. Fletcher, dean of Peterborow, a man of great learning, ſhould be
preſent, to inſtruct her in the principles of true religion. Her refuſal
to have any conference with this divine inflamed the earl of Kent's zeal; and
he bluntly told her, that her death would be the life of their religion; as, on
the contrary, her life would have been the death of it. Mention being made of
Babington, ſhe conſtantly denied his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to have been at all
known to her; and the revenge of her wrong, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned into the hands of
the Almighty.</p>
               <p>WHEN the earls had left her ſhe ordered ſupper to be
haſtened, that ſhe might have the more leizure to finiſh the few affairs
which remained to her in this world, and to prepare for her paſſage to
another. It was neceſſary for her, ſhe ſaid, to take ſome
ſuſtenance, left a failure of her bodily ſtrength ſhould depreſs her
ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits on the morrow, and leſt her behaviour ſhould thereby betray a
weakneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of herſelf<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

her manner uſually was; and her <pb n="618" facs="tcp:0429000102:223"/> wonted chearfulneſs
did not even deſert her on this occaſion. She comforted her ſervants
under the affliction which overwhelmed them, and which was too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful for
them to conceal from her. Turning to Bourgoin, her phyſician, ſhe aſked
him, whether he did not remark the great and invincible force of truth. 
<q rend="inline">"They pretend," ſaid ſhe, "that I muſt
die, becauſe I conſpired againſt the Queen's life: But the earl of Kent
avowed, that there was no other cauſe of my death, but the apprehenſions,
which, if I ſhould live, they entertain for their religion. My conſtancy in
the faith is my real crime: The reſt is only a colour, invented by
intereſted and deſigning men."</q> Towards the end of ſupper, ſhe
called in all her ſervants, and drank to them: They pledged her, in order, on
their knees; and craved her pardon for any paſt neglect of their duty: She
deigned, in return, to aſk their pardon for her offences towards them; and a
plentiful effuſion of tears attended this laſt ſolemn farewel, and
exchange of mutual forgiveneſs<note n="‖" place="bottom">Jebb, vol. II.
p. 302, 626. Camden, p. 531.</note>.</p>
               <p>HER care of her ſervants was the ſole remaining affair which
employed her concern in this world. She peruſed her will, in which ſhe had
provided for them by legacies: She ordered the inventory of her goods, cloaths,
and jewels to be brought her; and ſhe wrote down the names of thoſe to whom
ſhe bequeathed each particular: To ſome ſhe diſtributed money with her
own hands; and ſhe adapted the recompence to their different degrees of rank
and merit. She wrote alſo letters of recommendation for her ſervants to the
French King, and to her couſin the duke of Guiſe, whom ſhe made the chief
executor of her teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At her wonted time ſhe went to bed, ſlept
ſome hours; and then riſing, ſpent the reſt of the night in prayer.
Having foreſeen the difficulty of exerciſing the rites of her religion,
ſhe had had the precaution to obtain a conſecrated hoſt from the hands of
pope Pius, and ſhe had reſerved the uſe of it for this laſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of
her life. By this expedient ſhe ſupplied, as much as ſhe could, the want
of a prieſt and confeſſor, who was refuſed her<note n="†" place="bottom">Jebb, vol. II. p. 489.</note>.</p>
               <p>TOWARDS the morning ſhe dreſſed herſelf in a rich habit
of ſilk and velvet, the only one which ſhe had reſerved to herſelf. She
told her maids, that ſhe would willingly have left them this dreſs rather
than the plain garb which ſhe wore the day before: But it was neceſſary
for her to appear at the enſuing ſolemnity in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent habit.</p>
               <p>THOMAS Andrews, ſheriff of the county, entered the room, and
informed her, that the hour was come, and that he muſt attend her to the
place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She replied, that ſhe was ready; and bidding adieu to
her ſervants, ſhe leaned <pb n="619" facs="tcp:0429000102:224"/> on two of Sir Amias
Paulet's guards, becauſe of an infirmity in her limbs; and ſhe followed the
ſheriff with a ſerene and compoſed aſpect. In paſſing thro' a hall
adjoining to her chamber, ſhe was met by the earls of Shrewſbury and Kent,
Sir Amias Paulet, Sir Drue Drury, and many other gentlemen of diſtinction.
Here ſhe alſo found Andrew Melvil, her ſteward, who flung himſelf on
his knees before her; and, wringing his hands, cried aloud: 
<q rend="inline">"Ah! madam! unhappy me! What man was ever before
the meſſenger of ſuch heavy tidings as I muſt carry, when I ſhall
return to my native country, and ſhall report, that I ſaw my gracious Queen
and Miſtreſs beheaded in England?"</q> His tears prevented further
ſpeech; and Mary too felt herſelf moved, more from ſympathy than
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. 
<q rend="inline">"Ceaſe, my good ſervant," ſaid ſhe,
"ceaſe to lament: Thou haſt cauſe rather to rejoice than to mourn: For
now ſhalt thou ſee the troubles of Mary Stuart receive their long expected
period and determination."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Know," continued ſhe, "good ſervant, that
all the world at beſt is vanity, and ſubject ſtill to more ſorrow than
a whole ocean of tears is able to bewail. But I pray thee, carry this
meſſage from me, that I die a true woman to my religion, and unalterable in
my affections to Scotland and to France. Heaven forgive them, that have long
deſired my end, and have thirſted for my blood as the hart panteth after
the water brooks."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"O God," added ſhe, "thou that art the author
of truth and truth itſelf, thou knoweſt the inmoſt receſſes of my
heart: Thou knoweſt, that I was ever deſirous to preſerve an entire union
between Scotland and England, and to obviate the ſource of all theſe fatal
diſcords. But recommend me, Melvil, to my ſon, and tell him, that
notwithſtanding all my diſtreſſes, I have done nothing prejudicial to
the ſtate and kingdom of Scotland."</q> After theſe words, reclining
herſelf, with weeping eyes, and face bedewed with tears, ſhe kiſſed
him. 
<q rend="inline">"And ſo," ſaid ſhe, "good Melvil,
fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel: Once again, farewel, good Melvil; and grant the aſſiſtance of
thy prayers to thy Queen and miſtreſs<note n="*" place="bottom">MS. p. 4.
Jebb, vol. II. p. 631. Strype, vol III. p. 384.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>SHE then turned about to the noblemen who attended her, and made
a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in behalf of her ſervants, that they might be well treated, that
they might be allowed to enjoy the preſents which ſhe had made them, and be
ſent ſafely into their own country. Having received a favourable anſwer,
ſhe moved another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that they might be permitted to attend her at
her death: In order, ſaid ſhe, that their eyes may behold, and their hearts
bear witneſs, how patiently their Queen and miſtreſs can bear her
execution, and how conſtantly ſhe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres in her attachments to her
religion. The earl of Kent oppoſed this deſire, and told her, that they
would be apt, by their ſpeeches and cries, both to diſturb 
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:0429000102:225"/> herſelf and the ſpectators: He was alſo
apprehenſive, leſt they ſhould practiſe ſome ſuperſtition, unmeet
for him to ſuffer; ſuch as dipping their handkerchiefs in her blood: For
that was the inſtance which he made uſe of. 
<q rend="inline">"My lord," ſaid the Queen of Scots, "I will
give my word (altho' it be but dead) that they ſhall not incur any blame in
any of the actions which you have named. But alas! poor ſouls! it would be a
great conſolation to them to bid their miſtreſs farewel. And I hope,"
added ſhe, "that your miſtreſs, being a maiden Queen, would vouchſafe,
in regard of womanhood, that I ſhould have ſome of my own people about me
at my death. I know, that her majeſty hath not given you any ſuch ſtrict
command, but that you might grant me a requeſt of far greater courteſy,
even tho' I were a woman of much inferior rank to that which I bear."</q>
Finding that the earl of Kent perſiſted ſtill in his refuſal, her mind,
which had fortified itſelf againſt the terrors of death, was affected by
this circumſtance of indignity, for which ſhe was not prepared. 
<q rend="inline">"I am couſin to your Queen," cried ſhe, "and
deſcended from the blood-royal of Henry the ſeventh, and a married Queen of
France, and an anointed Queen of Scotland."</q> The commiſſioners
perceiving how invidious their obſtinacy would appear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a little
together, and agreed, that ſhe might carry a few of her ſervants along with
her. She made choice of four men, and two maid-ſervants, for that
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>SHE then paſſed into another hall, where was erected the
ſcaffold, covered with black; and ſhe ſaw, with an undiſmayed
countenance, the two executioners, and all the preparations of death. The room
was crowded with ſpectators, and no one was ſo ſteeled againſt all
ſentiments of humanity, as not to be moved, when he reflected on her royal
dignity, conſidered the ſurprizing train of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, beheld her
mild but inflexible conſtancy, recalled her amiable accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, or
ſurveyed her beauties, which, tho' faded by years, and yet more by her
afflictions, ſtill diſcovered themſelves in this fatal moment. Here the
war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for her execution was read to her; and during this ceremony ſhe was
ſilent, but ſhewed, in her behaviour, an indifference and unconcern, as if
the buſineſs had no way regarded her. Before the executioners performed
their office, the dean of Peterborow ſtepped forth; and tho' the Queen
frequently told him, that he needed not concern himſelf about her, that ſhe
was ſettled in the ancient catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and Roman religion, and that ſhe meant
to lay down her life in defence of that faith; he ſtill thought it his duty
to perſiſt in his lectures and exhortations, and to endeavour her
converſion. He told her, that the Queen of England had in this moment ſhewn
a tender care of her; and notwithſtanding the puniſhment juſtly to be
inflicted on her, for her manifold treſpaſſes, was determined to uſe 
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:0429000102:226"/> every expedient for ſaving her ſoul from that
deſtruction with which it was ſo nearly threatned: That ſhe was now
ſtanding upon the brink of eternity, and had no other means of eſcaping
endleſs perdition, but by repenting her former wickedneſs, by juſtifying
the ſentence pronounced againſt her, by acknowleging the Queen's favours,
and by exerting a true and lively faith in Chriſt Jeſus: That the
ſcriptures were the only rule of doctrine, the merits of Chriſt the only
means of ſalvation; and if ſhe truſted in the inventions or devices of
men, ſhe muſt expect in a moment to fall into utter darkneſs, into a
place where ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, howling, and gnaſhing of teeth: That the
hand of death was upon her, the ax was laid to the root of the tree, the throne
of the great judge of heaven was erected, the book of her life was ſpread
wide, and the particular ſentence and judgment was ready to be pronounced
upon her: And that it was now, during this important inſtant, in her choice,
either to riſe to the reſurrection of life, and hear that joyful
ſalutation, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father,</hi> or to ſhare the
reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of condemnation, replete with ſorrow and grief; and to
ſuffer that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful denunciation, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting
fire</hi>

               <p>DURING this diſcourſe the Queen could not forbear
ſometimes betraying her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, by interrupting the preacher; and the
dean, finding that he had profited nothing by his lecture, at laſt bid her
change her opinion, repent her of her former wickedneſs, and ſettle her
faith upon this ground, that only in Chriſt Jeſus could ſhe hope to be
ſaved. She anſwered, again and again, with great earneſtneſs: 
<q rend="inline">"Trouble not yourſelf any more about the
matter: For I was born in this religion, I have lived in this religion, and in
this religion I am reſolved to die."</q> Even the two earls perceived, that
it was fruitleſs to harraſs her any further with theological diſputes;
and they ordered the dean to deſiſt from his unſeaſonable exhortations,
and to pray for her converſion. During the dean's prayer, ſhe employed
herſelf in private devotion from the office of the Virgin; and after he had
finiſhed, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced aloud ſome petitions in Engliſh, for the
afflicted church, for an end of her own troubles, for her ſon, and for Queen
Elizabeth; and prayed God, that that princeſs might long proſper, and be
employed in his ſervice. The earl of Kent obſerving, that in her devotions
ſhe made frequent uſe of the crucifix, could not forbear reproving her, for
her attachment to that popiſh trumpery, as he termed it; and he exhorted her
to have Chriſt in her heart, not in her hand<note n="†" place="bottom">MS. p. 15. Jebb, vol. II. p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="622" facs="tcp:0429000102:227"/> SHE now began, with the aid of her two
women, to diſrobe herſelf; and the executioner alſo lent his hand, to
aſſiſt them. She ſmiled, and ſaid, that ſhe was not accuſtomed to
undreſs herſelf before ſo large a company, nor to be ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch
valets. Her ſervants, ſeeing her in this condition, ready to lay her head
upon the block, burſt into tears and lamentations: She turned about to them;
put her finger upon her lips, as a ſign of impoſing ſilence upon
them<note n="*" place="bottom">Jebb, p. 307, 492.</note>; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given them
her bleſſing, deſired them to pray for her. One of her maids, whom ſhe
had appointed for that purpoſe, covered her eyes with a handkerchief; ſhe
laid herſelf down, without any ſign of fear or trepidation; and her head
was ſevered from her body at two ſtrokes by the executioner.</p>

forty-ſixth year of her age, and the nineteenth of her cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in England,
Mary Queen of Scots; a princeſs of great accompliſhments both of body of
mind, natural as well as acquired; but unfortunate in her life, and during one
period, very unhappy in her conduct. The beauties of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of her
air, combined to make her the moſt amiable of women; and the charms of her
addreſs and converſation aided the impreſſion which her lovely figure
made on the hearts of all beholders. Ambitious and active in her temper, yet
inclined to chearfulneſs and ſociety; of a lofty ſpirit, conſtant and
even vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in her purpoſe; yet polite, and gentle, and affable in her
demeanor; ſhe ſeemed to partake only ſo much of the male virtues as to
render her eſtimable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relinquiſhing thoſe ſoft graces which
compoſe the proper ornaments of her ſex. In order to form a juſt idea of
her character, we muſt ſet aſide one part of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, while ſhe
abandoned herſelf to the guidance of a profligate man; and muſt conſider
theſe faults, whether we admit them to be imprudences or crimes, as the
reſult of an inexplicable, tho' not uncommon, inconſtancy in the human
mind, of the frailty of our nature, of the violence of paſſion, and of the
influence which ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and ſometimes momentary incidents, have on
perſons, whoſe principles are not thoroughly confirmed by experience and
reflection. Enraged by the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conduct of her huſband, ſeduced by
the treacherous counſels of one in whom ſhe repoſed confidence,
tranſported by the violence of her own temper, which never lay ſufficiently
under the guidance of diſcretion; ſhe was betrayed into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which
may, with ſome difficulty, be accounted for, but which admit of no apology,
nor even of alleviation. An enumeration of her qualities might carry the
appearance of a panegyric; an account of her conduct muſt, in ſome parts,
wear the aſpect of a ſevere ſatire and invective.</p>
               <p>HER numerous misfortunes, the ſolitude of her long and tedious
captivity, and the perſecutions to which ſhe had been expoſed on account
of her religion, <pb n="623" facs="tcp:0429000102:228"/> had wrought her up to a degree of
bigotry during her latter years; and ſuch was the prevalent ſpirit and
principles of that age, that it is the leſs wonder, if her zeal, her
reſentment and her intereſt uniting, induced her to give conſent to a
deſign, which conſpirators, actuated only by the firſt of theſe
motives, had formed againſt the life of Elizabeth.</p>

ſufficiently apprized and acquainted.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was her ſorrow ſo much abated as to leave room
for reflection, than ſhe wrote a letter of apology to the King of Scots, and
ſent it by Sir Robert Cary, ſon to lord Hunſdon. She there told him, that
ſhe wiſhed he knew, but not felt, the unutterable grief of mind, ſhe
experienced, on account of that lamentable accident, which, without her
knowlege, much leſs concurrence, had happened in England: That as her pen
trembled, when ſhe attempted to write it, ſhe found herſelf obliged to
commit the relation of it to the meſſenger, her kinſman; who would
likewiſe inform his majeſty of every circumſtance, which attended this
diſmal and unlooked for misfortune: That ſhe appealed to the Supreme Judge
of heaven and earth for her innocence; and was alſo ſo happy, amidſt her
other afflictions, as to find, that many perſons in her court could bear
witneſs to her veracity in this proteſtation: That ſhe abhorred
hypocriſy and diſſimulation, eſteemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more worthy of a prince
than a ſincere and open conduct, and could never ſurely be eſteemed ſo
baſe and poor-ſpirited, as that, if ſhe had really given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for this
latal execution, ſhe could, on any conſideration, be induced to deny it:
That tho' ſhe was ſenſible of the juſtice of the ſentence, ſhe was
determined from clemency never to carry it into execution; and could not but
reſent the temerity of thoſe, who on this occaſion had diſappointed her
intentions: And that as no one loved him more dearly than herſelf, or bore a
more anxious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <pb n="624" facs="tcp:0429000102:229"/> for his welfare; ſhe hoped, that
he would conſider every one as his enemy, who endeavoured, on account of the
preſent incident, to excite any animoſity between them<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 536. Spotſwood, p. 358.</note>.</p>
               <p>IN order the better to appeaſe James, ſhe committed
Daviſon to priſon, and ordered him to be tried in the Star-Chamber for his
miſdemeanour. The ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary was confounded; and being ſenſible of the
danger, which muſt attend his entering into a conteſt with the Queen, he
expreſſed penitence for his error, and ſubmitted very patiently to be
railed at by thoſe very counſellors, whoſe perſuaſion had induced him
to incur the guilt, and who had promiſed to countenance and protect him. He
was condemned to impriſonment during the Queen's pleaſure, and to pay a
fine of ten thouſand pounds. He remained a long time in priſon; and the
fine, tho' it reduced him to want and beggary, was ſtrictly levied upon him.
All the favour, which he could obtain from the Queen, was the ſending him
ſmall ſupplies from time to time, to keep him from periſhing in
neceſſity<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 538.</note>. He privately
wrote an apology to his friend Walſingham, which contains many curious
particulars: The French and Scotch ambaſſadors, he ſaid, had been
remonſtrating with the Queen in Mary's behalf; and immediately after their
departure, ſhe commanded him, of her own accord, to deliver her the warrant
for the execution of that princeſs. She ſigned it readily and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it
to be ſealed with the great ſeal of England. She appeared in ſuch good
humour on this occaſion, that ſhe ſaid to him in a jocular manner, 
<q rend="inline">"Go tell all this to Walſingham, who is now
ſick: Tho' I fear he will die for ſorrow, when he hears it."</q> She added,
that, tho' ſhe had ſo long delayed the execution, leſt ſhe ſhould
ſeem to be actuated by malice or cruelty, ſhe was all along ſenſible of
the neceſſity of it. In the ſame converſation, ſhe blamed Drury and
Paulet, that they had not before eaſed her of this trouble; and ſhe
expreſſed her deſire that Walſingham would bring them to a compliance
in that particular. She was ſo bent on this purpoſe, that, ſome time
after, ſhe aſked Daviſon, whether any letter had come from Paulet with
regard to the ſervice expected of him. Daviſon ſhowed her Paulet's
letter; in which that gentleman flatly refuſed to act any thing
inconſiſtent with the principles of honour and juſtice. The Queen fell
into a paſſion, and accuſed Paulet, as well as Drury, of perjury, that,
having taken the oath of aſſociation, in which they had bound themſelves
to avenge her wrongs, they had yet refuſed to lend their hand on this
occaſion. 
<q rend="inline">"But others," ſhe ſaid, "will be ſound
leſs ſcrupulous."</q> Daviſon adds, that nothing but the conſent and
exhortations of the whole council could have engaged him <pb n="625" facs="tcp:0429000102:230"/>
to ſend off the warrant. He was well aware of his danger, and remembered,
that the Queen, after having ordered the execution of the duke of Norfolk, had
endeavoured, in like manner, to throw the whole blame and odium of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

had extorted, would for ever be expoſed to blame, and could not be excuſed
by any principles of equity or reaſon: That if theſe views were deemed

attended to; and theſe motives did ſtill more evidently oppoſe all
thoughts of a rupture with England, and all revival of expioded claims and

                  </gap>ſs if he truſted merely to the
force of his own ſlate, and had no recourſe to foreign powers for
aſſiſtance: That the objections, attending the introduction 
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:0429000102:231"/> of ſuccours from a more powerful monarch, appeared
ſo evident from all the tranſactions of hiſtory, that they could not
eſcape a perſon of the King's extenſive knowlege; but there were in the
preſent caſe, ſeveral peculiar circumſtances, which ought for ever to
prevent him from having recourſe to ſo dangerous an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: That the
French monarch, the antient ally of Scotland, might willingly uſe the
aſſiſtance of that kingdom againſt England; but would be diſpleaſed
to ſee the union of theſe two crowns on the head of James; an union, which
would ever after exclude him from all hopes of practicing that policy, formerly
ſo uſeful to France and ſo pernicious to the Scotch nation: That Henry,
beſides, infeſted with fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and domeſtic war, was not in a condition
of ſupporting diſtant allies; much leſs, would he undergo any hazard or
expence, in order to aggrandize a near kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the houſe of Guiſe,
the moſt determined enemies of his repoſe and authority: That the
extenſive power and exorbitant ambition of the Spaniſh monarch ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him a ſtill more dangerous ally to James; and as he evidently aſpired to an
univerſal monarchy in the weſt, and had in particular advanced ſome
claims on England, as if he were deſcended from the houſe of Lancaſter,
he was at the ſame time the common enemy of all princes, who deſired to
maintain their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and independance; and the immediate rival and
competitor of the King of Scots: That the Queen, by her own naval power, and
her alliance with the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, would probably intercept all ſuccours
which James might receive from abroad, and be enabled to decide the
controverſy in this iſland with the ſuperior forces of her own kingdom,
oppoſed to thoſe of Scotland: That if the King revived his mother's
pretenſions to the crown of England, he muſt alſo embrace her religion,
by which alone they could be juſtified; and muſt thereby undergo the infamy
of abandoning thoſe principles, in which he had been ſtrictly educated, and
to which he had hitherto religiouſly adhered: That as he would, by ſuch an
apoſtacy, totally alienate all the proteſtants in Scotland and England, he
could never gain the confidence of the catholics, who would ſtill entertain a
very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable doubt of his honour and ſincerity: That by advancing a
preſent claim to the crown, he forfeited the certain proſpect of his
ſucceſſion; and revived that national animoſity, which the late peace
and alliance between the kingdoms had happily extinguiſhed: That the whole
gentry and nobility of England had openly declared themſelves for the
execution of the Queen of Scots; and if James ſhowed ſuch violent
reſentment againſt that act of juſtice, they would be obliged, for their
own ſecurity, to prevent for ever ſo implacable and revengeful a prince
from ruling over them: And that, however ſome perſons might repreſent his
honour as engaged to ſeek vengeance for the preſent affront and injury, the
true honour of a prince conſiſted in wiſdom and moderation and juſtice,
not in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <pb n="627" facs="tcp:0429000102:232"/> the dictates of blind paſſion, or

Hearing that Philip, while he ſeemed to diſſemble the daily inſults and

to take ſhelter under the forts; he burned about an hundred veſſels,
laden with ammunition and naval ſtores; and he deſtroyed a great ſhip of

               <p>THE land enterprizes of the Engliſh were not, during this

was alarmed with the diſcovery of Babington's conſpiracy, and became
apprehenſive, leſt every one of his religion ſhould thenceforth be
treated with diſtruſt in England. He entered into a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with
the Spaniards, betrayed the city to them for a ſum of money, and engaged the
whole garriſon to deſert with him to the Spaniſh ſervice. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land York,
who commanded a fort near Zutphen, imitated his example; and the Hollanders,
formerly diſguſted with Leiceſter, and ſuſpicious of the Engliſh,
broke out into loud complaints againſt the improvidence, if not the treachery
of his adminiſtration. Soon after, he arrived himſelf in the Low Countries;
but his conduct was no-wiſe calculated to give them ſatisfaction, or to
remove the ſuſpicions, which they had entertained againſt him. The prince
of Parma having beſieged Sluys, he attempted to relieve the place, firſt by
ſea, then by land; but failed in both enterprizes, and as he aſcribed his
bad ſucceſs to the ill behaviour of the Hollanders, they were equally free
in reflections upon his conduct. The breach between them became wider every
day: They ſlighted his authority, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his meaſures, and neglected
his councils; while he endeavoured, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious behaviour, and by
violence, to recover that influence, which he had loſt by his imprudent and
ill concerted meaſures. He was even ſuſpected by the Dutch of a deſign
to uſurp upon their liberties; and the jealouſy entertained againſt him,
began to extend towards the Queen herſelf. That princeſs had made ſome

the two courts, eſpecially that of Spain, had no other intention than to
amuſe each of them its enemy by negotiation, and mutua ly relax the
preparations for defence or aſſault, the Dutch, who were determined, on no

diſturbed by the malignity of Leiceſter, who had left a faction behind him,
and who ſtill attempted, by means of his emiſſaries, to diſturb all the
operations of the ſlates. So ſoon as Elizabeth got intelligence of theſe

fixed all their affections. The fate of England muſt be decided in one battle

navy<note n="*" place="bottom">Bentivoglio, part II. lib 4</note>, it was
determined by the catholic monarch, to proceed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the execution of
his ambitious projects. During ſome time he had <pb n="631" facs="tcp:0429000102:236"/> been
ſecretly making preparations; 
<note place="margin">The Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Armada.</note> but ſo ſoon
as the reſolution was fully taken, every part of his vaſt empire
reſounded with the noiſe of armaments, and all hisminiſters, generals,
and admirals, were employed in forwarding the deſign. The marqueſs of Santo
Croce, a ſea officer of great reputation and experience, was deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
command the fleet; and by his counſel were the naval equipments conducted In
all the ports of Sicily, of Naples, of Spain and Portugal, artizans were
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in building veſſels of uncommon ſize and force; naval ſtores
were bought up at a prodigious expence; proviſions amaſſed; armies levied
and quartered in the maritime towns of Spain; and plans laid for fitting out
ſuch a fleet and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation as had never before had its equal in Europe.
The military prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Flanders were no leſs formidable. Forces from
all quarters were every moment aſſembling, to reinforce the duke of Parma.
Capizuchi and Spinelli, conducted forces from Italy: The marqueſs of Borgaut,
a prince of the houſe of Auſtria, levied troops in Germany: The Walloon and
Burgundian regiments were compleated or augmented: The Spaniſh infantry was
ſupplied with recruits; and an army of thirty four thouſand men were
aſſembled in the Netherlands, and kept in a readineſs to be tranſported
into England. The duke of Parma em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all the carpenters which he could
procure, either in Flanders or in Lower Germany, and the coaſts of the
Baltic; and he built at Dunkirk, and Newport, but eſpecially at Antwerp, a
great number of boats and flat bottomed veſſels, for the tranſport of his
infantry and cavalry into England. The moſt renowned nobility and princes of
Italy and Spain were ambitious of ſharing in the honour of this great
enterprize. Don Amadeaeus of Savoy, Don John of Medicis, Veſpaſian Gonzaga,
duke of Sabionetta, and the duke of Paſtrana, haſtened to join the army
under the duke of Parma. About two thouſand volunteers, many of them men of
family, had inliſted for the ſervice in Spain. No doubt was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
but ſuch vaſt preparations, conducted by officers of ſuch conſummate
ſkill, muſt finally be ſucceſsful. And the Spaniards, oſtentatious of
their power, and elevated with vain hopes, had already denominated their navy
the <hi>Invincible Armada.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NEWS of theſe extraordinary preparations ſoon reached
England; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſecrecy of the Spaniſh council, and
their pretending intentions to employ this force in the Indies, it was eaſily
concluded, that they meant to make ſome effort againſt England. 
<note place="margin">Preparations in England.</note> The Queen had
foreſeen the invaſion; and finding that ſhe muſt now contend for her
crown with the whole force of Spain ſhe made preparations for reſiſtance;
nor was ſhe diſmayed with that danger, by which all Europe apprehended
ſhe muſt of neceſſity be overwhelmed. Her force ſeemed very unequal
to reſiſt ſo powerful an enemy. All the ſeamen in England 
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:0429000102:237"/> amounted at that time only to fourteen thouſand two
hundred and ninety-five<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſon, p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſhipping was, in general, ſo ſmall, that, except a few of the Queen's
ſhips of war, there were not four veſſels belonging to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
which exceeded four hundred tuns<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p.

conſiſted only of twenty-eight veſſels<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 157.</note>, many of which were of very ſmall ſize;
none of them exceeding the bulk of our largeſt frigates, and moſt of them
deſerving rather the name of pinnaces than of ſhips. The only advantage of
the Engliſh fleet, conſiſted in the dexterity and courage of the
ſeamen, who being accuſtomed to ſail in tempeſtuous ſeas, and
expoſe themſelves to all dangers, as much exceeded in this particular the
Spaniſh mariners, as their veſſels were inferior in ſize and force to
thoſe of that nation<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>1.</note>. All the commercial towns of
England were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to furniſh ſhips for reinforcing this ſmall navy;
and they diſcovered, on the preſent occaſion, great alacrity in defending
their liberty and religion againſt thoſe imminent perils with which they
were menaced. The city of London, in order to ſhew their vigour in the common
cauſe, inſtead of fifteen veſſels which they were commanded to equip,
voluntarily fitted out double the number<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid.
p. 267.</note>. The gentry and nobility hired, and armed, and manned,
forty-three ſhips at their own charge<note n="§" place="bottom">Lives of
the Admirals, vol. I. p. 451.</note>; and all the loans of money which the
Queen demanded, were frankly granted by the perſons applied to. Lord Howard
of Effingham, a man of great courage and capacity, was lord admiral, and took
on him the command of the navy: Drake, Hawkins, and Frobiſher, the moſt
renowned ſeamen in Europe, ſerved under him. The main ſleet was
ſtationed at Plymouth. A ſmaller ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, conſiſting of forty
veſſels, Engliſh and Flemiſh, was commanded by the lord Seymour,
ſecond ſon of protector Somerſet; and lay off Dunkirk, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to
intercept the duke of Parma.</p>
               <p>THE land forces of England, compared to thoſe of Spain,
poſſeſſed contrary qualities to its naval power: They were more
numerous than the enemy, but much inferior in diſcipline, reputation, and
experience. An army of twenty thouſand men was diſpoſed in different
bodies along the ſouth coaſt; and orders were given them, if they could not
hinder the Spaniards from landing, to retire backwards, to waſte the country
around, and to wait for reinforcement from the neighbouring counties, before
they approached the enemy. A body of twenty-two thouſand foot, and a
thouſand horſe, under the command of the earl of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, was
ſtationed at Tilbury, in order to defend the capital. The main army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
conſiſted of thirty-four thouſand foot, and two thouſand horſe, and
was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <pb n="633" facs="tcp:0429000102:238"/> by lord Hunſdon. Theſe forces were
reſerved for the guard of the Queen's perſon; and were appointed to march
whitherſoever the enemy ſhould appear. The fate of England, if the whole
Spaniſh armies ſhould be able to land, ſeemed to depend on the iſſue
of a ſingle battle; and men of reflection enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the moſt diſmal
apprehenſions, when they conſidered the force of fifty thouſand veteran
Spaniards, commanded by experienced officers, under the duke of Parma, the
moſt conſummate general of the age; and compared this formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able armament
with the military power which England, not enervated by peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but long
diſuſed to war, could muſter up againſt it.</p>
               <p>THE chief ſupport of the kingdom ſeemed to conſiſt in
the vigour and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Queen's conduct; who, undiſmayed by the
preſent dangers, iſſued all her orders with tranquillity, animated her pe
ple to a ſteddy reſiſtance, and employed every reſource, which either
her domeſtic ſituation or her foreign alliances could afford her. She
ſent Sir Robert Sydney into Scotland; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the King to remain

Hanſe Towns, tho' not at that time on good terms with England, were induced
by the ſame motives, to retard ſo long the equipment of ſome veſſels
in their ports, that they became uſeleſs to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of invading
England. All the proteſtants throughout Europe, regarded this enterprize as
the critical event which was to decide for ever the fate of their religion; and
tho' unable, by reaſon of their diſtance, to join their force to that of
Elizabeth, they kept their eyes fixed on her conduct and fortune, and beheld
with anxiety, mixed with admiration, the intrepid countenance with which ſhe
encountered that dreadful tempeſt, which was every moment approaching
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her.</p>
               <p>THE Queen alſo was ſenſible, that, next to the general
popularity which ſhe enjoyed, and the confidence which her ſubjects
repoſed in her prudent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <pb n="634" facs="tcp:0429000102:239"/> the firmeſt
ſupport of her throne conſiſted in the general zeal of the people for the
proteſtant religion, and the ſtrong prejudices which they had imbibed
againſt popery. She took care, on this occaſion, to revive in the nation
this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their own ſect, and this abhorrence of the oppoſite.
The Engliſh were reminded of their former danger from the tyranny of Spain:
All the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities exerciſed by Mary againſt the proteſtants, were
aſcribed to the counſels of that bigotted and imperious nation: The bloody
maſſacres in the Indies, the unrelenting executions in the Low Countries,
the horrid cruelties and iniquities of the inquiſition, were ſet before
men's eyes: A liſt and deſcription was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and pictures
diſperſed, of the ſeveral inſtruments of torture with which, it was
pretended, the Spaniſh Armada was loaded: And every artifice, as well as
reaſon, was employed, to animate the people to a vigorous defence of their
religion, their laws, and their liberties.</p>
               <p>BUT while the Queen, in this critical emergence, rouzed the
animoſity of the nation againſt popery, ſhe treated the partizans of that
ſect with moderation, and gave not way to an undiſtinguiſhing fury
againſt them. Tho' ſhe knew, that Sixtus Quintus, the preſent pope,
famous for his capacity and his tyranny, had fulminated a new bull of
excommunication againſt her, had depoſed her from the throne, had
abſolved her ſubjects from their oaths of allegiance, had publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a
croiſade againſt England, and had granted plenary indulgence to every one
engaged in the preſent invaſion; ſhe would not believe, that all her
catholic ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects could be ſo blinded, as to ſacrifice to bigotry their
duty to their ſovereign, and the liberty and independency of their native
country. She rejected all violent counſels, by which ſhe was prompted to
ſeek pretexts for diſpatching the leaders of that party: She would not even
conſine any conſiderable number of them: And the catholics, ſenſible of
this good uſage, generally expreſſed the higheſt zeal for the public
defence. Some gentlemen of that ſect, conſcious that they could not
juſtly expect any truſt or authority, entered themſelves as volunteers in
the fleet or army<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 747.</note>: Some equipped
ſhips at their own charge, and gave the command of them to proteſtants:
Others were active in animating their tenants and vaſſals, and neighbours,
to the defence of their country: And every rank of men, burying for the
preſent all party diſtinctions, ſeemed to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with
order as well as vigour, to reſiſt the violence of theſe invaders.</p>
               <p>THE more to excite the martial ſpirit of the nation, the Queen
appeared on horſeback in the camp at Tilbury; and riding thro' the lines,
diſcovered a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <pb n="635" facs="tcp:0429000102:240"/> and animated countenance,
exhorted the ſoldiers to remember their duty to their country and their
religion, and profeſſed her intention, tho' a woman, to lead them herſelf
into the field againſt the enemy, and rather to periſh in battle than

               <p>THE Spaniſh Armada was ready on the beginning of May; but the
moment it was preparing to ſail, the marqueſs of Santa Croce, the admiral,
was ſeized with a violent fever, of which he ſoon after died. The
vice-admiral, the duke of Paliano, by a ſtrange concurrence of accident, at
the very ſame time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ina Sidonia, the nobleman of the
greateſt family in Spain, but unexperienced in action, and utterly
unacquainted with ſea affairs. Alcarede was appointed vice-admiral. This
misfortune, beſides the loſs of ſo great an officer as Santa Croce,
retarded the ſailing of the Armada, and gave the Engliſh more time for
their preparations to oppoſe them. At laſt, the fleet, full of hopes and
alacrity, ſet ſail from Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon; 
<note place="margin">29th May.</note> but next day met with a
violent tempeſt, which ſcattered the ſhips, ſunk ſome of the
ſmalleſt, and forced the reſt to take ſhelter in the Groyne, where they
waited till they could be refitted. When news of this event was carried to 
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:0429000102:241"/> England, the Queen concluded, that the deſign of an
invaſion was diſappointed for this ſummer; and being always ready to lay
hold of every pretence for ſaving money, ſhe made Walſingham write to the
admiral, directing him to lay up ſome of the larger ſhips, and to
diſcharge the ſeamen: But lord Effingham, who was not ſo ſanguine in
his hopes, uſed the freedom to diſobey theſe orders; and he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave
to retain the whole ſhips in ſervice, tho' it ſhould be at his own
expence<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p. 545.</note>. He took
advantage of a north wind, and ſailed towards the coaſt of Spain, with an
intention of attacking the enemy in their harbours; but the wind changing to
the ſouth, he became apprehenſive, leſt they might have ſet ſail, and
by paſſing him at ſea, invade England, now expoſed by the abſence of
the fleet. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, therefore, with the utmoſt expedition to Plymouth,
and lay at anchor in that harbour.</p>
               <p>MEANWHILE, the Armada had repaired all her damages; and with
freſh hopes ſet out again to ſea, in proſecution of her enterprize. The
fleet conſiſted of a hundred and thirty veſſels, of which near a
hundred were galleons, and were of greater ſize than any which had ever
before been uſed in Europe. It carried on board nineteen thouſand two
hundred and ninety-five ſoldiers, eight thouſand four hundred and
fifty-ſix mariners, two thouſand and eighty-eight galley ſlaves, and two
thouſand ſix hundred and thirty great pieces of braſs ordnance. It was
victualled for ſix months; and was attended with twenty leſſer ſhips,
called cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and ten ſalves with ſix oars apiece<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p. 221.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE plan formed by the King of Spain, was, that the Armada
ſhould ſail to the coaſt oppoſite to Dunkirk and Newport; and having
chaſed away all Engliſh or Flemiſh veſſels which might obſtruct the
paſſage, (for it was never ſuppoſed they could make oppoſition)
ſhould join themſelves with the duke of Parma, ſhould thence make ſail
to the Thames, and having landed the whole Spaniſh army, thus compleat at one
blow the entire conqueſt of England. In proſecution of this plan, Philip
gave orders to the duke of Medina, that, in paſſing along the chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nel, he
ſhould ſail as near the coaſt of France as he could with ſafety; that
he ſhould by this policy avoid meeting with the Engliſh fleet; and keeping
in view the main enterprize, ſhould neglect all ſmaller ſucceſſes,
which might prove an obſtacle, or even interpoſe a delay, to the
acquiſition of a kingdom<note n="†" place="bottom">Monſon. p.
157.</note>. After the Armada was under ſail, they took a fiſherman, who
informed them, that the Engliſh admiral had been lately at ſea, had heard
of the tempeſt which ſcattered the Armada, had retired back into Plymouth,
and no longer expecting an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion this ſeaſon, had laid up his
ſhips, and diſcharged moſt of the ſeamen. From <pb n="637" facs="tcp:0429000102:242"/>
this falſe intelligence the duke of Medina conceived the great facility of
attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſtroying the Engliſh ſhips in harbour; and he was
tempted, by the proſpect of ſo deciſive an enterprize, to break his
orders, and make ſail directly for Plymouth: A reſolution which proved the
ſafety of England. 
<note place="margin">19th July.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">The Armada arrives in the Channel.</note> The
Lizard was the firſt land made by the Armada, about ſunſet; and as the
Spaniards took it for the Ram-head near Plymouth, they bore out to ſea, with
an intention of returning next day, and attacking the Engliſh navy. They were
deſcried by Fleming, a Scotiſh pyrate, who was roving in theſe ſeas,
and who immediately ſet ſail, to inform the Engliſh admiral of their
approach<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſon, p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the ſafety of the fleet. Effingham had juſt time to get out of port, when
he ſaw the Spaniſh Armada coming full ſail towards him, diſpoſed in
the form of a half-moon, and ſtretching the diſtance of ſeven miles from
the extremity of one diviſion to that of the other.</p>
               <p>THE writers of that age raiſe their ſtile by a pompous

appeared upon the ocean, infuſing equal terror and admiration into the minds
of all beholders. The lofty maſts, the ſwelling ſails, and the towering
prows of the Spaniſh galleons, ſeem impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be juſtly painted,
otherwiſe than by aſſuming the colours of poetry; and an eloquent
hiſtorian of Italy, in imitation of Camden, has aſſerted, that the
Armada, tho' the ſhips bore every ſail, yet advanced with a ſlow motion;
as if the ocean groaned with ſupporting, and the winds were tired with
impelling, ſo enormous a weight<note n="†" place="bottom">

is, the largeſt of the Spaniſh veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels would ſcarce paſs for third
rates in the preſent navy of England; yet were they ſo ill framed, or ſo
ill governed, that they were quite unwieldy, and could not ſail upon a wind,
nor tack on occaſion, nor be managed in ſtormy weather by the ſeamen.
Neither the mechanics of ſhip-building, nor the experience of mariners, had
attained ſo great perfection as could ſerve for the ſecurity and
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſuch bulky veſſels; and the Engliſh, who had already had
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience how unſerviceable they commonly were, were not diſmayed with
their tremendous appearance.</p>
               <p>EFFINGHAM gave orders, not to come to a cloſe ſight with the
Spaniards, where the ſize of the ſhips, he ſuſpected, and the numbers
of ſoldiers, would be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to the Engliſh; but to cannonade
them at a diſtance, and to wait the opportunity which winds, currents, or
various chances muſt afford them, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting ſome ſcattered
veſſels of the enemy. Nor was it long before the event anſwered
expectation. A great ſhip of Biſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay, on board of which was a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <pb n="638" facs="tcp:0429000102:243"/>
part of the Spaniſh money, was ſet on fire by accident; and while all hands
were employed in extinguiſhing it, ſhe fell behind the reſt of the
Armada: The great galleon of Andaluzia was detained by the ſpringing of her
maſt: And both theſe veſſels were taken, after ſome reſiſtance,
by Sir Francis Drake. As the Armada advanced up the channel, the Engliſh hung
upon their rear, and ſtill infeſted them with ſkirmiſhes. Each trial
abated the confidence of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and added courage to the Engliſh;
and the latter ſoon found, that even in cloſe fight the ſize of the
Spaniſh ſhips was no advantage to them. Their bulk expoſed them the more
to the bullets of the enemy; while their cannon, placed too high, ſhot over
the heads of the Engliſh. The alarm having now reached the coaſt of
England, the nobility and gentry haſtened out with their veſſels from
every harbour, and reinſorced the admiral. The earls of Oxford,
Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, and Cumberland, Sir Thomas Cecil, Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter
Raleigh, Sir Thomas Vavaſor, Sir Thomas Gerrard, Sir Charles Blount; with
many others, diſtinguiſhed themſelves by this generous and
diſintereſted ſervice of their country. The Engliſh fleet, after the
conjunction of theſe ſhips, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to an hundred and forty fail.</p>
               <p>THE Armada had now reached Calais, a d caſt anchor before that
place, in expectation, that the duke of Parma, who had got intelligence of
their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, would put to ſea, and join his forces to them. The Engliſh
admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practiſed here a very ſucceſsful ſtratagem upon the Spaniards.
He took eight of his ſmaller ſhips, and filling them with all combuſtible
materials, ſent them, one after another, into the midſt of the enemy. The
Spaniards fancied, that they were fireſhips of the ſame contrivance with a
famous veſſel which had lately done ſo much execution at Antwerp; and
they immediately cut their cables, and took to ſlight with the greateſt
diſorder and precipitation. The Engliſh ſell upon them next morning,
while in confuſion; and beſides doing great damage to other ſhips, they
took or deſtroyed about twelve of the enemy.</p>
               <p>BY this time, it was become apparent, that the intention, for
which theſe great preparations were made by the Spaniards, was entirely
ſruſtrated. The veſſels, provided by the duke of Parma, were made for
tranſport, not for ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that general, when urged to leave the
harbour, utterly refuſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his flouriſhing army to ſuch
apparent hazard, as it muſt incur; while the Engliſh, not only were able to
keep the ſea, but ſeemed even to triumph over their enemy. The Spaniſh
admiral found, in many r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ncounters,
that while he loſt ſo conſiderable a part of his own navy, he had
deſtroyed only one ſmall veſſel of the Engliſh; and he foreſaw,
that, by continuing ſo unequal a combat, he muſt draw inevitable
deſtruction on all the remainder. He prepared therefore to

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1581</label> return homewards; but
as the winds were contrary in his paſſage thro' the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, he reſolved
to ſail northwards, and making the tour of the whole iſland, reach the
Spaniſh harbours by the ocean. The Engliſh fleet followed him during ſome
time; and had not their ammunition fallen ſhort, by the negligence of the
offices in ſupplying them, they had obliged the whole Armada to ſurrender
at diſcretion. The duke of Medina had once taken that reſolution; but was
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from it by the advice of his confeſſor. This concluſion of the
enterprize would have been more glorious to the Engliſh; but the event proved
equally fatal to the Spaniards. 
<note place="margin">Defeated.</note> A violent tempeſt overtook
the Armada after it paſſed the Orkneys: The ſhips had already loſt
their anchors, and were obliged to keep to ſea: The mariners, unaccuſtomed
to ſuch hardſhips, and not able to govern ſuch unwieldy veſſels,
yielded to the fury of the ſtorm, and allowed their ſhips to drive either
on the weſtern iſles of Scotland, or on the coaſt of Ireland, where they
were miſerably ſhipwrecked. Not a half of the navy returned to Spain; and
the ſeamen, as well as ſoldiers, who remained, were ſo overcome with
hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and fatigue, ſo diſpirited by their diſcomfiture, that they
filled all Spain with accounts of the valour of the Engliſh, and of the
tempeſtuous violence of that ocean which ſurrounds them.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the miſerable and diſhonourable concluſion of an
enterprize, which had been preparing for three years, which had exhauſted the
revenue and force of Spain, and which had long filled all Europe with anxiety
or expectation. Philip, who was a ſlave to his paſſions, but had an
entire command over his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, no ſooner heard of the mortifying
event, which blaſted all his ſchemes of ambition, than he fell on his
knees, and rendering thanks for that gracious diſpenſation of providence,
expreſſed his joy that the calamity was not greater. The Spaniſh
prieſts, who had ſo ofttn bleſt this holy croiſade, and foretold its
intallible ſucceſs, were ſomewhat at a loſs to account for the victory
gained over the catholic monarch by excommunicated heretics and an execrable
uſurper: But they at laſt diſcovered, that all the calamities of the
Spaniards had proceeded from their allowing the infidel Moors to live among
them<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype, vol. III. p. 525. On the fourth of

than a ſubſidy: For the law of Richard the third againſt benevolence was
never conceived to have any force. The member even proceeds to aſſert, with
ſome precaution, that it was in the power of Parliament to refuſe the
King's demand of a ſubſidy. And that there was an inſtance of that
liberty in Henry the third's time near four hundred years before. <hi>Sub

                  <note place="margin">A Parliament.</note> ELIZABETH foreſaw,
that this houſe of commons, like all the foregoing, would be governed by the
puritans; and therefore, to obviate their enterprizes, ſhe renewed, at the
beginning of the ſeſſion, her uſual injunction, that they ſhould not
on any account, preſume to treat of matters eccleſiaſtical.
Notwithſtanding this ſtrict inhibition, the zeal of one Damport moved him
to preſent a bill to the commons for remedying the grievances, and
reſtraining the tyranny, of the <pb n="641" facs="tcp:0429000102:246"/> eccleſiaſtical

               <p>THE imperious conduct of Elizabeth appeared ſtill more clearly
in another parliamentary tranſaction. The right of purveyance was an antient
prerogative, by which the officers of the crown could at pleaſure take
proviſions for the houſhold from all the neighbouring counties, and the
uſe of carts and carriages; and the price of theſe ſervices was fixed and
ſtated. The payment of the money was often diſtant and uncertain; and the
rates were always much inferior to the market price; ſo that purveyance,
beſides the ſlavery of it, was always regarded as a great burthen, and
being arbitrary and caſual, was liable to great abuſes. We may fairly
preſume, that the hungry courtiers of Elizabeth, ſupported by her unlimited
power, would be ſure to render this prerogative very oppreſſive to the
people; and the commons had, laſt ſeſſion, found it neceſſary to
paſs a bill for regulating theſe exactions: But the bill was loſt in the
houſe of peers<note n="‡" place="bottom">D'Ewe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p

abuſes begot a new attempt for redreſs; and the ſame bill was now
revived, and ſent up again to the houſe of peers, together with a bill for
ſome new regulations in the court of Exchequer. Soon after, the commons
received a meſſage from the upper houſe, deſiring them to appoint a
committee for a conference. At this conference, the peers informed them, that
the Queen, by a meſſage, delivered by lord Burleigh, had expreſſed her
diſpleaſure, that the commons ſhould preſume to touch on her
prerogative. If there were any abuſes, ſhe ſaid, either in impoſing
purveyance, or in the practice of the court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, her majeſty was
both able and willing to provide due reformation; but would not permit the
Parliament to intermeddle in theſe matters<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, alarmed at this intelligence, appointed a new committee to attend

ſhe ſaid, was greater than of her own ſelf, or even than any of them
could have of themſelves. She told them, that ſhe had already given orders
for an enquiry into the abuſes attending purveyance, but the dangers of the
Spaniſh invaſion had retarded the progreſs of that deſign; that ſhe
had as much ſkill, will, and power to rule her own houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold 
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:0429000102:247"/> as any ſubjects whatſoever to govern theirs, and
needed as little the aſſiſtance of her neighbours; that the Exchequer was
her chamber, conſequently more near to her than even her houſhold, and
therefore the leſs proper for them to intermeddle with; and that ſhe would
of herſelf, with the advice of her council and the judges, redreſs all
grievances in theſe matters, but would not permit them, by laws moved without

they often permitted the abuſes of purveyance<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <p>We may judge of the extent and importance of theſe
abuſes by a ſpeech of Bacon's againſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors, delivered in the
firſt Parliament of the ſubſequent reign. 
<q rend="inline">"Firſt," ſays he, "they take in hand
what they ought not to take; ſecondly, they take in quantity a far greater
proportion than cometh to your majeſty's uſe; thirdly, they take in an
unlawful manner, in a manner, I ſay, directly and expreſsly prohibited by
ſeveral laws. For the firſt, I am a little to alter their name: For
inſtead of takers, they become taxers: Inſtead of taking proviſions for
your majeſty's ſervice, they tax your people <hi>ad redimendam
vexationem;</hi> impoſing upon them and extorting from them divers ſums of
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſometimes in groſs, ſometimes in the nature of ſtipends
annually paid, <hi>ne noceant,</hi> to be freed and eaſed of their
oppreſſion. Again, they take trees, which by law they cannot do; timber
trees, which are the beauty, countenance and ſhelter of men's houſes; that
men have long ſpared from their own purſe and profit; that men eſteem,
for their uſe and delight, above ten times the value; that area loſs which
men cannot repair or recover. Theſe do they take, to the defacing and
ſpoiling of your ſubjects manſions and dwellings, except they may be
compounded with to their own appetites. And if a gentleman be too hard for them
while he is at home, they will watch their time when there is but a bailiſſ
or a ſervant remaining, and put the ax to the root of the tree, ere ever the
maſter can ſtop it. Again, they uſe a ſtrange and moſt unjuſt
exaction in cauſing the ſubjects to pay poundage of their own debts, due
from your majeſty unto them: So as a poor man, when he has had his hay or his
wood, or his poultry (which perchance he was full loath to part with, and had
for the proviſion of his own family and not to put to ſale) taken from him,
and that not at a juſt price, but under the value, and cometh to receive his
money, he ſhall have after the rate of twelve pence in the pound abated for
poundage of his due payment upon ſo hard conditions. Nay farther they are
grown to that extremity (as is affirmed, tho' it be ſcarce credible, ſave
that in ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

when the money is paid. For the ſecond point, moſt gracious ſoverign,

affirmed unto me by divers gentlemen of good report, as a matter which I may
ſafely avouch unto your majeſty, that there is no pound profit, which
redoundeth unto your majeſty in this courſe but induceth and begetteth
three pound damage upon your ſubjects, beſide the diſcontentment. And to
the end they may make their ſpoil more ſecurely, what do they? Whereas
divers ſtatutes do ſtrictly provide, that whatſoever they take ſhall be
regiſtered and atteſted, to the end that by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a collation of that
which is taken from the country and that which is anſwered above, their
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits might appear, they, to the end to obſcure their deceits, utterly
omit the obſervation of this which the law preſcribeth. And therefore to
deſcend, if it may pleaſe your majeſty, to the third ſort of abuſe,
which is of the unlawful manner of their taking, whereof this queſtion is a
branch; it is ſo manifold, as it rather aſketh an enumeration of ſome of
the particulars than a proſecution of all. For their price, by law they ought
to take as they can agree with the ſubject; by abuſe they take at an
impoſed and enforced price: By law they ought to make but one apprizement by
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the country; by abuſe, they make a ſecond apprizement at the
court gate, and when the ſubjects cattle come up many miles lean and out of
plight by reaſon of their travel, then they prize them anew at an abated
price: By law, they ought to take between ſun and ſun; by abuſe, they
take by twilight and in the night-time, a time well choſen for malefactors:
By law, they ought not to take in the high-ways (a place by her majeſty's
high prerogative protected, and by ſtatute by ſpecial words excepted) by
abuſe, they take in the high-ways: By law, they ought to ſhew their
commiſſion, &amp;c. A number of other particulars there are, &amp;c."</q>

                     <p>Such were the abuſes, which Elizabeth would neither permit

begot in the nation a kind of enthuſiaſtic paſſion for enterprizes
againſt Spain; and nothing ſeemed now impoſſible to be atchieved by the
valour and fortune of the Engliſh. Don Antonio, prior of Crato, was a natural
ſon of the royal family of Portugal, who, truſting to the averſion of his
countrymen againſt the Caſtilians, had advanced a claim to the crown, and
flying firſt to France, thence to England, had been encouraged both by Henry

ſtate of the kingdom, might have enſured them of ſucceſs: But hearing,
that great preparations were making at the Groine for the invaſion of
England, they were induced to go thither, and deſtroy this new armament of
Spain. They broke into the harbour; burned ſome ſhips of war, particularly
one commanded by Recalde, vice admiral of Spain; they defeated an army of four

aſſaulted the Groine, and took the lower town, which they pillaged; and

capital, while Drake undertook to ſail up the river, and attack the city with
his united forces. By this time, the court of Spain had got leizure to prepare
againſt the invaſion of the Engliſh. Forces were thrown into Liſbon:
The Portugueſe were diſarmed: All ſuſpected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were taken into
cuſtody: And thus, tho' the inhabitants bore great affection to Don Antonio,
none of them dared to declare in favour of the invaders. The Engliſh army,
however, made themſelves maſters of the ſuburbs, which abounded with
riches of all kinds; but as they deſired to conciliate the affections of the
Portugueze, and were more intent on honour than profit, they obſerved a
ſtrict diſcipline, and abſtained from all plunder. Meanwhile they found
their ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and proviſions totally exhauſted; they had not a ſingle
cannon to make a breach in the walls; the admiral had not been able to paſs
ſome fortreſſes, which guarded the river; there was no appearance of any
inſurrection in their favour; ſickneſs from fatigue, hunger, and
intemperance in wine and fruits had ſeized the army: So that it was found
requiſite to make all haſte poſſible to reimbark. They were not
purſued by the enemy; and finding, at the mouth of the river, ſixty ſhips
laden with naval ſtores, they ſeized them as lawful prize; tho' they
belonged to the Hanſe Towns, a neutral power. They ſailed thence to Vigo,
which they took and burned; and having ravaged the country round, they ſet

advantages, gained over the Spaniards, and the ſpirit, which they infuſed
into the Engliſh, gave Elizabeth great ſecurity during the reſt of her
reign, ſhe could not forbear keeping an anxious eye towards Scotland, whoſe
ſituation rendered the revolutions of that kingdom always of importance to
her. It might have been expected, that this high-ſpirited princeſs, who
knew ſo well to encounter danger, would not have retained that ſuſpicious
jealouſy towards Scotland, with which, during the life-time of Mary, ſhe
had been ſo much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated. James had indeed ſucceeded to all his mother's
claims; but he had not ſucceeded to the favour of the catholics, which could
alone render theſe claims dangerous<note n="*" place="bottom">Winwood, vol. I.
p. 51.</note>: And as the Queen was now well advanced in years, and enjoyed the
moſt uncontrouled authority over her ſubjects, it was not likely, that the
King of Scots, who was of an indolent unambitious temper, would ever give her
any diſturbance in the poſſeſſion of her throne. Yet all theſe
circumſtances could not remove her timorous ſuſpicions: And ſo far from
ſatisfying the nation by a ſettlement of the ſucceſſi n, or a
declaration of James's title, ſhe was as anxious to prevent every incident,
which might raiſe his credit or procure him the regard of the Engliſh, as
if he had been her immediate rival and competitor. Moſt of his miniſters
and favourites were her penſioners; and as ſhe was deſirous to hinder him
from marrying and having children, ſhe obliged them to throw obſtacles in
the way of every alliance, even the moſt reaſonable, which could be offered
him; and during ſome years, ſhe ſucceeded in this malignant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy<note n="†" place="bottom">Melvil, p. 166, 177.</note>. He had fixed on the
eldeſt daughter of the King of Denmark, who being a remote prince and not
very powerful, could give her no umbrage; yet did ſhe ſo artfully croſs
this negotiation, that the Daniſh monarch, impatient of delay, married his
daughter to the duke of Brunſwic. James then renewed his ſuit to the
younger princeſs; and ſtill found obſtacles from the intrigues of
Elizabeth, who, merely with a view of interpoſing delay, propoſed to him
the ſiſter of the King of Navarre, a princeſs much older than himſelf,
and entirely deſtitute of fortune. The young King, beſides the deſire of
ſecuring himſelf by offspring, from thoſe traiterous attempts, too
frequent among his ſubjects, had been ſo watched by the rigid auſterities
of the eccleſiaſtics, that he had another inducement to marriage, which is
not ſo uſual with monarchs. His impatience, therefore, broke thro' all the
politics of Elizabeth: The articles of marriage were ſettled: The ceremony
was performed by proxy: And the princeſs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for Scotland; but was
drove by a ſtorm into a port of Norway. This tempeſt, and ſome others,
which happened near the ſame time, were univerſally believed in Scotland
and Denmark to have proceeded from a combination of the <pb n="647" facs="tcp:0429000102:252"/>

ſorcery, was not deterred by this incident from taking a voyage, in order to
conduct his bride home: He arrived in Norway; carried the Queen thence to
Copenhagen; and having paſſed the winter in that city, he brought her next
ſpring to Scotland, where they were joyfully received by the people. The
clergy alone, who never let paſs an opportunity of vexing him, made
oppoſition to the Queen's coronation, on account of the ceremony of anointing
her, which, they alledged, was either a Jewiſh or a popiſh rite; and
therefore utterly antichriſtian and unlawful. But James was as much bent on
the ceremony, as they were averſe to it; and after much controverſy and
many intrigues, his authority, which had not often happened, at laſt
prevailed over their oppoſition<note n="†" place="bottom">Spot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </label> AFTER a ſtate of great anxiety and
many difficulties, Elizabeth had at length reached a ſituation, where, tho'
her affairs ſtill required attention, and found employment for her active
temper, ſhe was removed from all danger of any immediate revolution, and
might regard the efforts of her enemies with ſome degree of confidence and
ſecurity. Her ſucceſsful and prudent adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had gained her,
together with the admiration of foreigners, the affections of her own
ſubjects; and after the death of the Queen of Scots, even the catholics,
however diſcontented, pretended not to diſpute her title, or adhere to any
other perſon as her rival and competitor. James, curbed by his factious
nobility and eccleſiaſtics, poſſeſſed at home very little
authority; and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

on good terms with Elizabeth and the Engliſh nation, in hopes that time,
aided by his patient tranquillity, would ſecure him that rich
ſucceſſion, to which his birth entitled him. The Hollanders, tho'
overmatched in their conteſt with <pb n="648" facs="tcp:0429000102:253"/>

reſiſtance; and ſuch was their unconquerable anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy to their old
maſters, and ſuch the prudent conduct of young Maurice, their governor,
that the ſubduing that ſmall territory, if at all poſſible, muſt be
the work of years, and the reſult of many and great ſucceſſes. Philip,
who, in his powerful effort againſt England, had been tranſported by
reſentment and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition beyond his uſual cautious maxims, was now
diſabled, and ſtill more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, from adventuring again on ſuch
hazardous enterprizes. The ſituation alſo of affairs in France, began
chiefly to employ his attention; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his artifice, and
force, and expence, the events in that kingdom proved every day more contrary
to his pretenſions, and more favourable to the friends and confederates of
England.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">French affairs.</note> THE violence of the
League having conſtrained Henry to declare war againſt the Hugonots,
theſe religioniſt, ſeemed expoſed to the utmoſt danger; and
Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, ſenſible of the intimate connection between her own intereſts
and thoſe of that party, had ſupported the King of Navarre by her
negociations in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and ſtill more by large ſums of money, which
ſhe remitted for levying forces in that country. That heroic prince, not
diſcouraged by the great ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of his enemies, took the field; and
in the year 1587 gained, at Coutras, a compleat victory over the army of the
French King; but as his allies, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, were at the ſame time
diſcomfited by the army of the League, under the duke of Guiſe, his
ſituation, notwithſtanding his victory, ſeemed ſtill as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as
ever. The chief advantage which he reaped from this diverſity of ſucceſs,
was the diviſions which, by that means, took place among his enemies. The
inhabitants of Paris, intoxicated with admiration of Guiſe, and ſtrongly
preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt their King, whoſe intentions had become ſuſpicious
to them, took to arms, and obliged Henry to fly for his ſafety. That prince,
diſſembling his reſentment, entered into negociation with the League; and
having conferred many high offices on Guiſe and his partizans, ſummoned an
aſſembly of the ſtates at Blois, under preten e of finding means and
expedients to ſupport the intended war againſt the Hugonots. The various
ſcenes of perſidy and cruelty which had been exhibited in France, had
juſtly begot a mutual di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

among all parties; yet Guiſe, truſting more to the timidity than honour of
the King, raſhly put himſelf into the hands of that monarch, and expected,
by the aſcendant of his own ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, to make him ſubmit to all his
exorbitant pretenſions. Henry, tho' of an eaſy diſpoſition, not
ſteddy to his reſolutions, nor even to his promiſes, wanted neither
courage nor capacity;

ſubtilties eluded by the vigour of Guiſe, and even his throne expoſed to
the moſt imminent danger, he embraced <pb n="649" facs="tcp:0429000102:254"/> more violent
counſels than were natural to him, and ordered that duke and his brother, the
cardinal of Guiſe, to be aſſaſſinated in his palace.</p>
               <p>THIS cruel execution, which the neceſſity of it could alone
excuſe, had nearly proved fatal to the author, and ſeemed at firſt to
plunge him into greater dangers than thoſe which he ſought to avoid, by
taking vengeance on his enemy. The partizans of the league were enflamed with
the utmoſt rage againſt him: The populace every where, particularly at
Paris, renounced all allegiance to him: The eccleſiaſtics and the preachers
filled all places with execrations againſt his name: And the moſt powerful
cities, and the moſt opulent provinces, appeared to combine in a reſolution
of renouncing monarchy, or of changing their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. Henry, finding ſlender
reſources among his catholic ſubjects, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to enter into a
confederacy with the Hugonots and the King of Navarre: He enliſted large
bodies of Swiſs infantry and German cavalry: And being ſtill ſupported by
his chief nobility, he aſſembled, by all theſe means, an army of near
forty thouſand men, and advanced to the gates of Paris, ready to cruſh the
League, and ſubdue all his enemies. The deſperate reſolution of one man
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the courſe of theſe great events. Jaques Clement, a Dominican
monk, inflamed by that bloody ſpirit of bigotry which diſtinguiſhes this
century, and a great part of the following one, beyond all other ages of the
world, embraced the reſolution of ſacrificing his own life, in order to
ſave the church from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of an heretical tyrant; 
<note place="margin">Murder of Henry the third.</note> and being
admitted, under ſome pretext, to the King's preſence, he gave that prince a
mortal wound with a knife, and was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put to death, by the courtiers,
who haſtily revenged the murder of their ſovereign. This remarkable
incident happened on the firſt of Auguſt, 1589.</p>
               <p>THE King of Navarre, next heir to the crown, aſſumed the
government, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of Henry the fourth; but ſucceeded to much
greater difficulties than thoſe which ſurrounded his predeceſſor. The
prejudices entertained againſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, made a great part of the
nobility deſert him; and it was only by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of hearkening to
conferences and inſtruction, that he could engage any of the catholics to
adhere to his undoubted title. The League, governed by the duke of Mayenne,
brother to Guiſe, gathered new force; and the King of Spain entertained
views, either of diſmembering the monarchy, or of annexing the whole to his
own dominions. In theſe diſtreſsful circumſtances, Henry addreſſed
himſelf to Elizabeth, and found her well diſpoſed to contribute to his
aſſiſtance, and to oppoſe the progreſs of the catholic League, and of
the King of Spain, her inveterate and dangerous enemies. To prevent the
deſertion of his Swiſs and German troops, ſhe made him a preſent of
twenty-two thouſand pounds; a larger <pb n="650" facs="tcp:0429000102:255" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſum
than, as he declared, he had ever ſeen before: And ſhe ſent him a
reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of four thouſand men, under lord Willoughby, an officer of
reputation, who joined the French at Dieppe. Strengthened by theſe
ſupplies, Henry march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly to Paris; and having taken the ſuburbs,
ſword in hand, he abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be pillaged by his ſoldiers. He
employed this body of Engliſh troops in many other enterprizes; and found
ſtill great cauſe to praiſe their courage and fidelity. The time of their
ſervice being elapſed, he diſmiſſed them with many high
commendations. Sir William Drury, Sir Thomas Baſkerville, and Sir John
Boroughs, acquired reputation this campaign, and revived in France the ancient
fame of Engliſh valour.</p>

army which Henry next campaign led into the field, was much inferior to that of
the League; but as it was compoſed of the chief nobility of France, he feared
not to encounter his enemies in a pitched battle at Yvr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

ſucceſs enabled him to blockade Paris, and he reduced that capital to the
laſt extremity of famine: When the duke of Parma, in conſequence of orders
from Philip, marched to the relief of the League, and obliged Henry to raiſe
the blockade. Having performed this important ſervice, he retired back to the
Low Countries; and by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate ſkill in the art of war, performed
theſe long marches in the face of the enemy, without affording the French
monarch that opportunity which he ſought, of giving him battle, or ſo much
as putting his army once in diſorder. The only loſs which he ſuſtained,
was in the Low Countries; where prince Maurice took advantage of his abſence,
and recovered ſome towns which Parma had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly conquered from the

affairs, tho' promiſing, was not ſo well advanced or eſtabliſhed as to
make the Queen diſcontinue her ſuccours; and ſhe was ſtill more
confirmed in the reſolution of ſupporting him, by ſome advantages gained
by the King of Spain. The duke of Mercoeur, governor of Britanny, a prince of
the houſe of Lorraine, had declared for the League; and finding himſelf
hard preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Henry's forces, he had been obliged, in order to his
ſecurity, to introduce ſome Spaniſh troops into the ſea-port towns of
that province. Elizabeth was <pb n="651" facs="tcp:0429000102:256"/> alarmed with the danger;
and foreſaw, that the Spaniards, beſides infeſting the Engliſh commerce
by privateers, might employ theſe harbours as the ſeat of their naval
preparations, and might more eaſily, from that near neighbourhood, than from
Spain or Portugal, project an invaſion of England. She concluded, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
a new treaty with Henry, in which ſhe engaged to ſend over three thouſand
men, to be employed in the reduction of Britanny, and ſtipulated, that her
charges ſhould, in a twelve month, or ſo ſoon as the enemy was expelled,
be refunded her<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 561.</note>. Theſe forces
were commanded by Sir John Norris; and under him by his brother Henry, and by
Anthony Shirley. Sir Roger Williams was at the head of a ſmall body which
garriſoned Dieppe: And a ſquadron of ſhips, under the command of Sir
Henry Palmer, lay upon the coaſt of France, and intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the
veſſels belonging to the Spaniards or the Leaguers.</p>
               <p>THE events of war can very little be regulated before hand by
any treaty or agreement; and Henry, who found it requiſite to lay aſide the
projected enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize againſt Britanny, perſuaded the Engliſh commanders
to join his army, and to take a ſhare in the war which he carried on in
Picardy<note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 116.</note>.
Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſguſt which Elizabeth received from this
diſappointment, he laid before her a plan for expelling the Leaguers from
Normandy, and perſuaded her to ſend over a new body of four thouſand men,
to aſſiſt him in that enterprize. The earl of Eſſex was appointed
general of theſe forces; a young nobleman, who, by many exterior
accompliſhments, and ſtill more real merit, was daily advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in favour
with Elizabeth, and ſeemed to occupy that place in her affections which
Leiceſter, who was now deceaſed, had ſo long enjoyed. Eſſex,
impatient for military fame, was extremely uneaſy to lie ſome time at
Dieppe unemployed; and had not the orders which he received from his
miſtreſs been ſo poſitive, he would gladly have accepted of Henry's
invitation, and have marched to join the French army now in Champagne. This
plan of operations was alſo propoſed to Elizabeth, by the French
ambaſſador; but ſhe rejected it with great diſpleaſure; and ſhe
threatned immediately to recall her troops, if Henry ſhould perſevere any
longer in his preſent practice, of breaking all concert with her, and
attending to nothing but his own intereſts<note n="‡" place="bottom">Birch's Negociations.

into Normandy, and laid ſiege to Roüen, which he reduced to great
difficulties. But the League, who were unable of themſelves to take the field
againſt him, had again recourſe to the duke of Parma, who received orders
to march to their aſſiſtance. He executed this enterprize with his
uſual ability <pb n="652" facs="tcp:0429000102:257"/> 
                  <label type="milestone">

ſucceſs; and, for the preſent, fruſtrated all the projects of Henry and
Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth. This princeſs, who kept ſtill in view the intereſts of her
own kingdoms in all her foreign tranſactions, was impatient under theſe
diſappointments, blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Henry for his negligence in the execution of
treaties, and complained, that the Engliſh forces were thruſt forward in
every hazardous enterprize<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p.
562.</note>. It is probable, however, that their own ardent courage, and their
deſire of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing themſelves in ſo celebrated a theatre for
war, were the cauſe why they ſo often enjoyed this perilous honour.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the indifferent ſucceſs of former
enterprizes, the Queen was ſenſible how neceſſary it was to ſupport
Henry againſt the League and the Spaniards; and ſhe formed a new treaty
with him, in which they agreed, never to make peace with Philip, but by common
conſent; <hi>ſhe</hi> promiſed to ſend him a new ſupply of four
thouſand men; and <hi>he</hi> ſtipulated to repay her charges in a
twelvemonth, to employ theſe forces, joined to a body of French troops, in an
expedition againſt Britanny, and to conſign into her hands a ſea-port
town of that province, for a retreat to the Engliſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. XVI. p. 151, 168, 171, 173.</note>. Henry knew the
impoſſibility of execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of theſe articles, and the imprudence
of fulfilling others; but finding them rigidly inſiſted on by Elizabeth, he
accepted of her ſuccours, and truſted that he might eaſily, under ſome
pretence, be able to excuſe his failure in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his part of the
treaty. This campaign was the leaſt ſucceſsful to Henry of all thoſe
which he had yet carried on againſt the League:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Naval enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes againſt Spain.</note>
DURING theſe military operations in France, Elizabeth employed her naval
power againſt Spain, and endeavoured to intercept the Weſt-Indian
treaſures, the ſource of that greatneſs which rendered Philip ſo
formidable to all his neighbours. She ſent a ſquadron of ſeven ſhips,
under the command of lord Thomas How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, for this ſervice; but the King of
Spain, informed of her purpoſe, fitted out a navy of fifty-five ſail, and
diſpatched them to eſcort the Indian fleet. They fell in with the Engliſh
ſquadron; and by the courageous obſtinacy of Sir Richard Greenville, the
vice-admiral, who refuſed to make ſail with the reſt of the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
they took one ſhip, the firſt Engliſh man of war which had yet fallen
into the hands of the Spaniards<note n="†" place="bottom">This action of
Sir Richard Greenville is ſo ſingular, as to merit a more particular
relation. He was engaged alone with the whole Spaniſh fleet of fifty-three
ſail, which had ten thouſand men on board; and from th time the fight
begun, which was about three in the afternoon, to the break of day next
morning, he repulſed the enemy fifteen times, tho' they continually ſhifted
their veſſels, and boarded with freſh men. In the beginning of the action
he himſelf received a wound; but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued doing his duty above deck till
eleven at night, when receiving a freſh wound, he was carried down to be
dreſſed. During this operation he received a ſhot in the head, and the
ſurgeon was killed by his ſide. The Engliſh began now to want powder; all
their ſmall arms were broke or become uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; of their number, which
were but a hundred and three at firſt, forty were killed, and almoſt all
the reſt wounded; their maſts were beat overboard, their tackle cut in
pieces, and nothing but a hulk left, unable to move one way or other. In this
ſituation Sir Richard propoſed to the ſhip's company, to truſt to the
mercy of God, not to that of the Spaniards, and to deſtroy the ſhip with
themſelves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ather than yield to
the enemy. The maſter gunner, and many of the ſeamen, agreed to this
deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reſolution; but others oppoſed it, and obliged Greenville to
ſurrender himſelf priſoner. He died a few days after; and his laſt
words were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="653" facs="tcp:0429000102:258"/> England, fruſtrated of their expectations, but
pleaſing themſelves with the idea that their attempt had not been
altogether fruitleſs in hurting the enemy. The Indian fleet had been ſo
long detained in the Havanna, from the fear of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that they were
obliged at laſt to ſet ſail in an improper ſeaſon, and moſt of them
periſhed by ſhipwreck ere they reached the Spaniſh harbours<note n="‡" place="bottom">Monſon, p. 163.</note>. The earl of Cumberland made
a like unſucceſsful enterprize againſt the Spaniſh trade. He carried
out one ſhip of the Queen's, and ſeven others, equipped at his own
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; but the prizes which he made, did not compenſate him for the
charge<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 169.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE ſpirit of theſe expenſive and hazardous adventures was
very prevalent in England. Sir Walter Raleigh, who had enjoyed great favour
with the Queen, finding his intereſt to decline, reſolved to recover her
good graces by ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant undertaking; and as his reputation was high in
England, he perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great numbers to engage with him as volunteers, in an
attempt on the Weſt-Indies. The fleet was detained ſo long in the Channel,
by contrary winds, that the ſeaſon was loſt: Raleigh was recalled by the
Queen: Sir Martin Forbiſher ſucceeded to the command, and made a
privateering voyage againſt the Spaniards. He took a rich Carrack near the

authority ſo eſtabliſhed, that ſhe needed to make them no
conceſſions in return, or ſhe rated her power and prerogative above
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: For there was never any Parliament whom ſhe treated in ſo haughty a
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whom ſhe made more ſenſible of their own weakneſs, or whoſe
privileges ſhe more undervalued. When the ſpeaker, Sir Edward Coke, made
the three uſual demands, of freedom from arreſts, of acceſs to her
perſon, and of liberty of ſpeech; ſhe replied to him, by the mouth of
Puckering, lord-keeper, that liberty of ſpeech was granted the commons, but
they muſt know what liberty they were entitled to; not a liberty for every
one to ſpeak what he liſteth, or what cometh in his brain to utter; their
privilege extended no farther than a liberty of Aye or No: That ſhe enjoined
the ſpeaker, if he perceived any idle heads ſo negligent of their own
ſafety, as to attempt reforming the church, or innovating in the
commonwealth, that he ſhould refuſe any bills exhibited to that purpoſe,
till they were examined by ſuch as were fitter to conſider of theſe
things, and could better judge of them: That ſhe would not impeach the
free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their perſons; but they muſt beware, leſt, under colour of
this privilege, they imagined, that any neglect of their duty could be covered
or protected: And that ſhe would not refuſe them acceſs to her perſon;
provided it was upon urgent and weighty cauſes, and at times convenient, and
when ſhe might have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from other important cauſes of the

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the menacing and contemptuous air of this
ſpeech, the intrepid and indefatigable Peter Wentworth, not diſcouraged by
his former ill ſucceſs, ventured to tranſgreſs the imperial orders of
Elizabeth. He preſented to the lord keeper a petition, in which he deſired
the upper houſe to join the lower in a ſupplication to her majeſty, for
entailing the ſucceſſion of the crown; and declared, that he had a bill
ready prepared for that purpoſe. This method of proceeding was ſufficiently
reſpectful and cautious; but the ſubject was always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
diſagreeable to the Queen, and what ſhe had expreſsly prohibited any one
to meddle with: She ſent Wentworth immediately to the Tower; committed Sir
Thomas Bromley, who had ſeconded him, to the Fleet priſon, together with

About a fortnight after, a motion was made in the houſe, to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the

only tend to the prejudice of the gentlemen whom they meant to ſerve: She
would releaſe them whenever ſhe thought proper, and would be better

might well repreſs all farther attempts for freedom: But the religious zeal
of the puritans was not ſo eaſily reſtrained; and it inſpired a courage
which no human motive was able to ſurmount. Morrice, attorney of the court of
wards, made a motion for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the abuſes in the biſhops' courts,

This motion was ſeconded by ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but the miniſters and privy

The Queen ſent for the ſpeaker; and after requiring him to deliver
Morrice's bill to her, ſhe told him, that it was in her power to call
Parliaments, in her power to diſſolve them, in her power to give aſſent
or diſſent to any determination which they ſhould form: That her
purpoſe in ſummoning thi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Parliament was twofold, to have laws enacted
for the farther enforcement of uniformity in religion, and to provide for the
defence of the nation, againſt the exorbitant power of Spain: That theſe
two points ought, therefore, to be the object of their deliberation: She had
enjoin d them already, by the mouth of the lord keeper, to meddle neither with
matters of ſtate nor of religion; and ſhe wondered how any one could be

               <p>THE Queen having thus expreſsly pointed out, both what the
houſe ſhould and ſhould not do, the commons were as obſequious to the
one as to the other of her injunctions. They paſſed a very ſevere law
againſt recuſants; ſuch a law as was ſuited to the perſecuting
ſpirit of Elizabeth, and of that age. It was intitled, An act to retain her
majeſty's ſubjects in their due obedience; and was meant, as the preamble
declares, to obviate ſuch inconveniencies and perils as might grow from the
wicked practices of ſeditious ſectaries and diſloyal perſons: For
theſe two ſpecies of criminals were always, at that time, confounded
together, as equally dangerous to the peace of ſociety. It was enacted, that
any perſon, above ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, who obſtinately refuſed,
during the ſpace of a month, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the public worſhip, ſhould be
committed to priſon; that, if after being condemned for this offence, he
perſiſt three months in his refuſal, he muſt abjure the realm; and that
if he either refuſe this condition, or return after baniſhment, he is to
ſuffer capitally as a felon, without benefit of clergy<note n="‡" place="bottom">35 Eliz. c. 1.</note>. This law bore equally hard upon the
puritans as upon the catholics; and had it not been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Queen's
authority, was probably, in that reſpect, very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the private
ſentiments and inclinations of the majority in the houſe of commons. Very
little oppoſition, however, appears there to have been openly made to it<note n="‖" place="bottom">After enacting this ſtatute, the clergy, in order
to remove the odium from themſelves, often took care that recuſants
ſhould be tried by the civil judges at the aſſizes, rather than by the
eccleſiaſtical commiſſioners. Strype's Ann. vol. IV. p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE expences of the war with Spain having reduced the Queen to
great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a ſupply, the grant of ſubſidies ſeems to have
been the moſt important buſineſs of this Parliament; and it was a
ſingular mark of the high ſpirit of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, that, while conſcious of a
preſent dependance on the commons, ſhe opened the ſeſſion with the
moſt haughty treatment of them, and covered her weakneſs under ſuch a
lofty appearance of ſuperiority. The commons readily voted two ſubſidies
and four fifteenths; but this ſum not appearing ſufficient to the court, a
very unuſual expedient was fallen upon to induce them to make an enlargement
in <pb n="657" facs="tcp:0429000102:262"/> their conceſſion. The peers informed the commons
in a conference, that they could not give their aſſent to the ſupply
voted, thinking it too ſmall for the Queen's occaſions: They therefore
propoſed a grant of three ſubſidies and ſix fifteenths, and deſired a
conference, in order to perſuade the commons to agree to this meaſure. The
commons, who had acquired the privilege of beginning all bills of ſubſidy,
took offence at this procedure of the lords, and at firſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
rejected the conference: But being afraid, on reflection, that they had, by
this refuſal, given offence to their ſuperiors, they both agreed to the
confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and afterwards voted the additional ſubſidy<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 18<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Queen, notwithſtanding this unuſual conceſſion of
the commons, ended the ſeſſion with a ſpeech, containing ſome
reprimands to them, and full of the ſame high pretenſions, which ſhe had
aſſumed at the opening of the Parliament. She took notice, by the mouth of
the keeper, that ſome members ſpent more time than was requiſite, by
indulging themſelves in harangues and reaſonings: And ſhe expreſſed
her diſpleaſure on account of their not paying the due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to privy
counſellors, 
<q rend="inline">"who," ſhe told them, "were not to be
accounted as common knights and burgeſſes of the houſe, who are

alſo, in her own perſon, made the Parliament a ſpirited harangue; in
which ſhe ſpoke of the juſtice and moderation of her government,
expreſſed the ſmall am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ſhe had ever entertained of making
conqueſts, diſplayed the juſt grounds of her quarrel with the King of
Spain, and diſcovered how little ſhe apprehended the power of that monarch,
even tho' he ſhould make a greater effort than that of his Invincible Armada.

un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that ſhe would exerciſe martial law upon ſuch cowards: For
there was no ſtatute by which a man could be puniſhed for changing his

               <p>THE King of France, tho' he had hitherto made war on the league
with great bravery and reputation, tho' he had this campaign gained
conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages over them, and tho' he was aſſiſted by a
conſiderable body of Engliſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <pb n="658" facs="tcp:0429000102:263"/> Norris, who
carried hoſtilities into the heart of Britanny; was become ſenſible, that
he never could, by force of arms alone, render himſelf maſter of his
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The nearer his military ſucceſſes ſeemed to approach him to a
full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the throne, the more diſcontent and jealouſy
aroſe among thoſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts who adhered to him; and a party was formed
in his own court to elect ſome catholic monarch of the royal blood, if he
refuſed any longer to ſatisfy them by declaring his converſion. This
excellent prince was far from being a bigot to his ſect; and as he eſteemed
theſe theological diſputes to be entirely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the public
good, he had tacitly determined, from the beginning, to come, ſome time or
other, to the reſolution required of him. He had found, on the death of his
predeceſſor, that the hugonots, who formed the braveſt and moſt
faithful part of his army, were ſuch determined zealots, that, if he had, at
that time, abjured their faith, they would inſtantly have abandoned him to
the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions and uſurpations of the catholics. The more bigoted
catholics, he knew, particularly thoſe of the League, had entertained ſuch
an unſurmountable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt his perſon, and diffidence of his
ſincerity, that even his converſion would not reconcile them to his title;
and he muſt either expect to be entirely excluded the throne, or to be
admitted to it on ſuch terms as would leave him little more than the mere
ſhadow of royalty. In this delicate ſituation he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to
temporize; to retain the hugonots by continuing the profeſſion of their
religion; to gain the moderate catholics by giving them hopes of his
converſion; to attach both to his perſon by conduct and ſucceſs; and he
hoped, either that the animoſity of war againſt the League would make them
drop gradually the queſtion of religion, or that he might, in time, after
ſome victories over his enemies and ſome conferences with divines, make
finally, with more decency and dignity, that abjuration, which muſt have
appeared, at firſt, both mean and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious to both parties.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Henry IV. embraces the catholic
reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> WHEN the people are attached to any theological tenets,
merely from a general perſuaſion or prepoſſeſſion, they are
eaſily induced, by any motive or authority, to change their faith in theſe
myſterious ſubjects; as appears from the example of the Engliſh, who,
during ſome reigns, generally embraced, without ſcruple, the ſtill
varying religion of their ſovereigns. But a nation, like the French, where
principles had ſo long been diſplayed as the badges of faction, and where
each party had fortified its belief by an animoſity againſt the other, were
not found ſo pliable or inconſtant; and Henry was at laſt convinced, that
the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics of his party would entirely abandon him, if he gave them not
immediate ſatisfaction in this particular. The hugonots alſo, taught by
experience, clearly ſaw, that his deſertion of them was become entirely
neceſſary for the public <pb n="659" facs="tcp:0429000102:264"/> ſettlement; and ſo
general was this perſuaſion among them, that, the duke of Sully pretends,
even the divines of that party purpoſely allowed themſelves to be overcome
in the diſputes and conferences; that the King might more readily be
convinced of the weakneſs of their cauſe, and might more cordially and
ſincerely, at leaſt more decently, embrace the religion, which it was ſo
much his intereſt to believe. If this ſelf-denial, in ſo tender a point,
ſhould appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible and ſupernatural in theologians, it will, at
leaſt, be thought very natural, that a prince, ſo little inſtructed in
theſe points as Henry, and ſo deſirous to preſerve his ſincerity,
ſhould inſenſibly bend his opinion to the neceſſity of his affairs,
and ſhould believe that party to have the beſt arguments, who could alone
put him in poſſeſſion of a kingdom. All circumſtances, therefore,
being prepared for this great event, that monarch renounced the proteſtant
religion, and was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly received by the French prelates of his party,
into the boſom of the church.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH, who was, herſelf, chiefly attached to the
proteſtants, by her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and the circumſtances of her birth, and
who ſeems to have entertained ſome propenſity, during her whole life, to
the catholic ſuperſtition, at leaſt, to the antient ceremonies, yet
pretended to be extremely diſpleaſed with this abjuration of Henry, and
ſhe wrote him a very angry letter, reproaching him with this intereſted
change of his religion. Senſible, however, that the League and the King of
Spain were ſtill their common enemies, ſhe hearkened to his apologies;
continued her ſuccours both of men and money; and formed a new league, in
which they mutually ſtipulated never to make peace but by common

had been taken, while he was making his paſſage ſecretly into Spain; and
ſome papers were found about him, by which a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of
ſome catholic noblemen with Philip was diſcovered. The earls of Angus,
Errol, and Huntley, the heads of three potent families, had entered into a
confederacy with the Spaniſh monarch; and had ſtipulated to raiſe all
their forces, to join with thirty thouſand Spaniſh troops, which Philip
engaged to ſend into Scotland; and after re-eſtabliſhing the catholic
religion in that kingdom, to march with their united power, in order to
effectuate the ſame purpoſe in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 391. Rymer, tom. XVI p. 19<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

eaſy to be executed by the ſmall revenue and limited authority of James. He
deſired, therefore, ſome ſupply from her of men and money; but tho' ſhe
had reaſon to eſteem the proſecution of the three popiſh earls a common

Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 235.</note>: But ſhe ſeems ever to have borne ſome
degree of malignity to James, whom ſhe hated, both as her heir, and as the
ſon of Mary, her hated rival and competitor. So far from giving him
aſſiſtance to proſecute the catholic conſpirators, ſhe rather
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his inquietude, by countenancing the turbulent diſpoſition
of the earl of Bothwel<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 257,

Bothwel more than once attempted to render himſelf maſter of the King's
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and being expelled the kingdom for theſe traiterous deſigns, he
took ſhelter in England, was ſecretly protected by the Queen, and lurked
near the borders, where his power lay, with a view of ſtill enterprizing
ſome new violence. He ſucceeded at laſt in an attempt on the King; and by
the mediation of the Engliſh ambaſſador, impoſed very diſhonourable
terms upon that prince: But James, with the authority of the convention of
ſtates, annulled this agreement as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by violence; again expelled
Bothwel the country; and obliged him to take ſhelter in England. Elizabeth,
pretending ignorance of the place of his retreat, never executed the treaties,
by which ſhe was obliged to deliver up all rebels and fugitives to the King
of Scotland. During theſe diſorders, encreaſed by the refractory
diſpoſition of the eccleſiaſtics, the proſecution of the catholic
earls remained in ſuſpence; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1594"/> but at laſt the
Parliament paſſed an act of attainder againſt them, and the King prepared
himſelf to execute it by force of arms. The noblemen, tho' they obtained a
victory over the earl of Argyle, who acted by the King's commiſſion, found
themſelves hard preſſed by James himſelf, and agreed, on certain terms,
to leave the kingdom. Bothwel, being detected in a confederacy with them,
forfeited the favour of Elizabeth, and was obliged to take ſhelter, firſt
in France, then in Italy, where he died, ſome years after, in great
poverty.</p>
               <p>THE eſtabliſhed authority of the Queen ſecured her from

received a bribe to poiſon her from Fuentes and Ibarra, who had ſucceeded
Parma, lately deceaſed, in the government of the Netherlands; but he
maintained, that he had no other intention than to cheat Philip of his money,
and never meant to fulfil his promiſe. He was, however, executed for the

King, who had long carried on hoſtilities with Philip, was at laſt
provoked, by the taking of Chatelet and Dourlens, and the attack of Cambray, to

               <p>SOME diſguſts, which ſhe had received from the ſtates,

the money, which ſhe had expended in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. The ſtates,
beſides alledging the conditions of the former treaty, by which they were not
obliged to repay her, till the concluſion of a peace, pleaded their preſent
poverty and diſtreſs, the great ſuperiority of the Spaniards, and the
difficulty of ſupporting the war; much more, of ſaving money to diſcharge
their incumbrances. After much negotiation, a new treaty was at laſt formed;
by which the ſtates were bound to free the Queen immediately from the charge
of the Engliſh auxiliaries, computed at forty thouſand pounds a year, to
pay her annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally twenty thouſand pounds for ſome years, to aſſiſt
her with a certain number of ſhips, and to conclude no peace nor treaty

a great expence of blood and treaſure, made war againſt Philip in France
and the Low Countries, the moſt ſevere blows, which ſhe gave the
Spaniſh greatneſs, were owing to thoſe naval enterprizes, which either
ſhe or her ſubjects ſcarce ever intermitted during one ſeaſon. In
1594, Richard Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, ſon to Sir John, the famous navigator, procured the
Queen's commiſſion, and ſailed with three ſhips to the South Sea by the
ſtraits of Magellan: But his voyage proved unfortunate, and he himſelf was
taken priſoner on the coaſt of Chili. James Lancaſter was fitted out the
ſame year with three ſhips and a pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace by the merchants of London; and
was more fortunate in his adventures. He took thirty-nine ſhips of the enemy;
and not contented with this ſucceſs, he made an attempt on Fernambouc in
Brazil, where, he knew, great treaſures were at that time lodged. As he
approached the land, he ſaw it lined with great numbers of the enemy; but
no-wiſe daunted with this appearance, he placed the ſtouteſt of his men
in boats, and ordered them to row with ſuch violence againſt the ſhore as
to ſplit them in pieces. By this bold action, he both deprived his men of all
hopes of returning but by victory, and terrified the enemy, who fled after a
ſhort reſiſtance. He returned home ſafely with the treaſure, which he
had ſo bravely acquired. In 1595, Sir Walter Raleigh, who had anew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
the Queen's friendſhip by an intrigue with one of the maids of honour, and
who had been confined in priſon for this miſdemeanor, no ſooner recovered
his liberty than he was puſhed by his active and enterprizing genius to
attempt ſome great action. The ſucceſs of the firſt Spaniſh
adventurers againſt Mexico and Peru had begot an extreme avidity in Europe;
and a prepoſſeſſion univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally took place, that in the inland parts
of South America, called Guiana, a country as yet undiſcovered, there were
mines and treaſures and riches far beyond any thing which Cortes or Pizarro
had yet met with. Raleigh, whoſe turn of mind was ſomewhat romantic and
extravagant, undertook at his own charge the diſcovery of this wonderful
country. Having taken the ſmall tower of St. Joſeph in the iſle of
Trinidado, where he found no riches, he left his ſhip, and ſailed up the
river Oroonoko in pinnaces, but without meeting with any thing to anſwer his
expectations. On his return, he publiſhed an account of this country, full of
the greateſt and moſt palpable lies, that were ever attempted to be
impoſed on the credulity of mankind<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p.

ſame year, Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins undertook a more important
expedition againſt the Spaniſh ſettlements in America; and they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with them ſix ſhips of the Queen's and twenty more, which they had either
fitted out at their own charges, or which were furniſhed them by private
adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers. Sir Thomas Baſkerville was appointed commander of the land
forces, which they carried on board with them. Their firſt deſign was to
attempt Porto Rico, where, they knew, a rich carrack was at that time
ſtationed; but as they had not preſerved the requiſite ſecrecy, a
pinnace, having ſtrayed from the fleet, was taken by the Spaniards, and
betrayed the intentions of the Engliſh. Preparations were made in that
iſland to receive them; and the Engliſh fleet, notwithſtanding the brave
aſſault, which they made on the enemy, was repulſed with loſs. Hawkins
ſoon after died; and Drake purſued his courſe to Nombre di Dios, on the
iſthmus of Darien; where, having landed his men, he attempted to paſs
forward to Panama, with a view of plundering that place, or, if he found ſuch
a ſcheme practicable, of keeping and fortifying it. But he met not with the
ſame facility, which had attended his firſt enterprizes on theſe parts.
The Spaniards, taught by experience, had every where fortified the paſſes,
and had ſtationed troops in the woods; which ſo infeſted the Engliſh by
continual alarms and ſkirmiſhes, that they were obliged to return, without
being able to effectuate any thing. Drake himſelf, from the intemperance of
the climates, from the fatigues of his journey, and from the vexation of his
diſappointment, was ſeized with a diſtemper, of which he ſoon after
died. Sir Thomas Baſkerville took the command of the fleet, which was in a
very weak condition; and after having ſought a battle near Cuba with a
Spaniſh fleet, of which the event was not deciſive, he returned to England.
The Spaniards ſuffered ſome loſs from this enterprize; but the Engliſh
reaped no profit<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſon, p. 167.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE bad ſucceſs of this enterprize in the Indies made the
Engliſh rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Spaniſh dominions in Europe, where, they heard,
Philip was making great preparations for a new invaſion of England. A
powerful fleet was equipped at Plymouth conſiſting of an hundred and
ſeventy veſſels, ſeventeen of which were capital ſhips of war; the
reſt tenders and ſmall veſſels: Twenty ſhips were added by the
Hollanders. In this fleet there were computed to be ſix thouſand three
hundred and ſixty ſoldiers, a thouſand volunteers, and ſix thouſand
ſeven hundred and ſeventy-two ſeamen, beſide the Dutch. The land forces
were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the earl of Eſſex. The navy by lord Effingham, high
admiral. Both theſe commanders had expended great ſums of their own in this
armament: For ſuch was the ſpirit of Elizabeth's reign. The lord Thomas
Howard, Sir <pb n="665" facs="tcp:0429000102:270"/>

Raleigh, Sir Francis Vere, Sir George Carew, and Sir Coniers Clifford had
commands in this expedition, and were named as a council to the general and
admiral<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 591.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE fleet ſet ſail on the firſt of June 1596; and meeting
with a fair wind, bent their courſe to Cadiz, at which place, by ſealed
orders delivered to all the captains, the general rendeſvous was appointed.
They ſent before them ſome armed tenders, which intercepted every ſhip,
that could carry intelligence to the enemy; and they themſelves were ſo
fortunate when they came near Cadiz, as to take an Iriſh veſſel, by which
they learned, that that port was full of merchant ſhips of great value, and
that the Spaniards lived in perfect ſecurity, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of
an enemy. This intelligence much encouraged the Engliſh fleet, and gave them
the proſpect of a fortunate iſſue to the enterprize.</p>
               <p>AFTER a fruitleſs attempt to land at St. Sebaſtians on the
weſtern ſide of the iſland of Cadiz; it was, upon deliberation,
reſolved by the council of war to attack the ſhips and gallies in the bay.
This attempt was eſteemed very raſh; and the lord admiral himſelf, who
was cautious in his temper, had entertained great ſcruples with regard to it:
But Eſſex ſtrenuouſly urged the enterprize; and when he found the
reſolution at laſt taken, he threw his hat into the ſea, and gave
ſymp'oms of the moſt extravagant joy. He felt, however, a great
morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, when Effingham informed him, that the Queen, who was anxious
for his ſafety, and who dreaded the effects of his youthful ardour, had
ſecretly given orders, that he ſhould not be permitted to command the van
in the attack<note n="†" place="bottom">Monſon, p. 196.</note>. That
duty was performed by Sir Walter Raleigh and the lord Thomas Howard; but
Eſſex no ſooner came within reach of the enemy, than he forgot the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which the admiral had exacted of him to keep in the midſt of the
fleet: He broke thro' and preſſed forward into the thickeſt of the fire.
Emulation for glory, avidity of plunder, animoſity againſt the Spaniards,
proved incentives to every one; and the enemy were ſoon obliged to looſe
anchor, and retreat farther into the bay, where they ran many of their ſhips
aground. Eſſex then landed his men at the fort of Puntal; and immediately
marched to the attack of Cadiz, which the impetuous valour of the Engliſh
ſoon carried ſword in hand. The generoſity of Eſſex, which was not
inferior to his valour, made him ſoon ſtop the ſlaughter, and treat his
priſoners with the greateſt humani y, and even aſſability and
kindneſs. The Engliſh made a rich plunder in the

                  <pb n="666" facs="tcp:0429000102:271"/> into the hands of the enemy. It was computed, that the
loſs, which the Spaniards ſuffered in this enterprize, amounted to twenty
millions of ducats<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol II p.
97.</note>; beſides the indignity, which that proud and ambitious people
received, from the taking one of their chief cities, and deſtroying in their
harbour a fleet of ſuch force and value.</p>
               <p>ESSEX, all on fire for glory, regarded this great ſucceſs
only as a ſtep to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture atchievements: He inſiſted on the keeping
poſſeſſion of Cadiz, and he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took with four hundred men and three
months proviſions, to defend the place till ſuccours ſhould arrive from
England. But all the other ſeamen and ſoldiers were ſatisfied with the
glory which they had acquired; and were impatient to return home, in order to
ſecure their plunder. Every other propoſal of Eſſex to annoy the enemy,
met with a like reception; his ſcheme for intercepting the carracks at the
Azores, for aſſaulting the Groyne, for taking St. Andero, and St.
Sebaſtian: And the Engliſh, finding ſo great difficulty to drag this
impatient warrior from the enemy, at laſt left him on the Spaniſh coaſt,
attended with very few ſhips. He complained much to the Queen, of their want
of ſpirit in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; nor was ſhe ſatisfied, that they had
returned without attempting to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the Indian fleet<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 121.</note>; but the great ſucceſs in the enterprize
on Cadiz, had covered all their miſcarriages: And that princeſs, tho' ſhe
admired the lofty ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of Eſſex, could not forbear expreſſing an
eſteem for the other officers<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p.
593.</note>. The admiral was created earl of Nottingham; and this promotion
gave great diſguſt to Eſſex<note n="‖" place="bottom">Sydney
Papers, vol. II. p. 77.</note>. In the preamble of the patent it was ſaid,
that the new dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was conferred on him, on account of his good ſervices
in taking Cadiz, and deſtroying the Spaniſh ſhips; a merit which
Eſſex pretended to belong ſolely to himſelf: And he offered to maintain
this plea by ſingle combat againſt the earl of Nottingham, or his ſons,
or any of his kindred.</p>
               <p>THE atchievements in the ſubſequent year proved not ſo
fortunate; but, as the Indian fleet very narrowly eſcaped the Engliſh,
Philip had ſtill reaſon to ſee the great hazard and diſadvantage of
that war in which he was engaged, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority which the Engliſh,
by their naval power, and their ſituation, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired over him. The Queen,
having received intelligence, that the Spaniards, tho' their fleets were ſo
much ſhattered and deſtroyed, by the expedition at Cadiz, were preparing a
ſquadron at Ferrol and the Groyne, and were marching troops thither, with a
view of making an invaſion on Ireland, was reſolved to prevent their
enterprize, and to deſtroy the ſhipping in theſe harbours. She prepared a
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:0429000102:272"/> large fleet of a hundred and twenty ſail, of which
ſeventeen were her own ſhips, forty-three were ſmaller veſſels, and
the reſt tenders and victuallers: She em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on board this fleet five
thouſand new-levied ſoldiers, and added a thouſand veteran troops, whom
Sir Francis Vere brought from the Netherlands. The earl of Eſſex, commander
in chief, both of the land and ſea forces, was at the head of one ſquadron:
Lord Thomas Howard was appointed vice-admiral of another; Sir Walter Raleigh of
the third: Lord Mountjoy commanded the land forces under Eſſex: Vere was
appointed marſhal: Sir George Carew lieutenant of the ordnance, and Sir
Chriſtopher Blount firſt colonel. The earls of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Southampton,
the lords Grey, Cromwel, and Rich, with ſeveral other perſons of
diſtinction, attended as volunteers. Eſſex declared his reſolution,
ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deſtroy this new Armada, which threatned England, or to periſh
in the attempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">9th July.</note> THIS powerful fleet ſet
ſail from Plymouth; but were no ſooner out of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour than they met
with a furious ſtorm, which ſhattered and diſperſed them; and before
they could be refitted, Eſſex found, that their proviſions were ſo far
ſpent, that it would not be ſafe to carry ſo numerous an army along with
him. He diſmiſſed, therefore, all the ſoldiers, except the thouſand
veterans under Vere; and laying aſide all thoughts of attacking Ferrol or the
Groyne, he confined the object of his expedition to the intercepting the Indian
fleet; which had at firſt been conſidered only as the ſecond enterprize
which he was to attempt.</p>
               <p>THE Indian fleet, at that time, by reaſon of the imperfection
of navigation, had a ſtated courſe, as well as ſeaſon, both in their
going out and in their return; and there were certain iſlands, at which, as
at fixed ſtages, they always touched, and where they took in water and
proviſions. The Azores, being one of theſe places where, about this time,
the fleet was expected, Eſſex bent his courſe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and he informed
Raleigh, that he, on his arrival, intended to attack Fayal, one of theſe
iſlands. By ſome accident the ſquadrons were ſeparated; and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh
arriving firſt before Fayal, thought it more prudent, after waiting ſome
time for the general, to begin the attack alone, leſt the inhabitants
ſhould, by farther delay, have leizure to make greater preparations for their
deſence. He ſucceeded in the enterprize; but Eſſex, jealous of Raleigh,
expreſſed great diſpleaſure at this conduct, and conſtrued it as an
intention of robbing the general of the glory which attended that action: He
caſhiered, therefore, Sydney, Bret, Berry, and others, who had concuried in
the attempt; and would have proceeded to the ſame extremity againſt Raleigh
himſelf, had not lord Thomas Howard interpoſed with his good offices, and
perſuaded Raleigh, tho' very high-ſpirited, to make <pb n="668" facs="tcp:0429000102:273"/>
ſubmiſſions to the general. Eſſex, who was placable, as well as
haſty and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, was ſoon appeaſed, and both received Raleigh
into favour, and reſtored the other officers to their command<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſon, p. 173.</note>. This incident, however, tho' the quarrel
was ſeemingly accommodated, laid the firſt foundation of that violent
animoſity which afterwards took place between theſe two gallant
commanders.</p>
               <p>ESSEX made next a diſpoſition proper for intercepting the
Indian galleons; and Sir William Monſon, whoſe ſtation was the moſt
remote of the fleet, having fallen in with them, made the ſignals which had
been agreed on. That able offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer here aſcribes Eſſex's failure of
ſucceſs, when he was ſo near attaining ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an advantage, to his
want of experience in ſeamanſhip; and the account which he gives of the
errors committed by that nobleman, appears very reaſonable as well as
candid<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 174.</note>. The Spaniſh
fleet, finding that their enemy was upon them, made all the ſail poſſible
to the Terceras, and got into the ſafe and well fortified harbour of Angra,
before the Engliſh fleet could overtake them. Eſſex inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted only
three ſhips; which, however, were ſo rich as to pay all the charges of the
expedition.</p>
               <p>THE cauſes of this miſcarriage of Eſſex's enterprize,
were much canvaſſed in England, upon the return of the fleet; and tho' the
courtiers took party differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, as they affected either Eſſex or
Raleigh, the people, in general, who bore an extreme affection to the
gallantry, ſpirit, and generoſity of the former, were inclined to juſtify
every circumſtance of his conduct. The Queen, who loved the one as much as
ſhe eſteemed the other, maintained a kind of neutrality, and endeavoured to
ſhare her favours with an impartial hand between the parties. Sir Robert
Cecil, ſecond ſon to lord Burleigh, was a courtier of very promiſing
hopes, much connected with Raleigh; and ſhe made him ſecretary of ſtate,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Sir Thomas Bodley, whom Eſſex recommended for that office.
But not to diſguſt Eſſex by this preference, ſhe promoted him to the
dignity of earl mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of England, an office which had been vacant ever
ſince the death of the earl of Shrewſbury. Eſſex might perceive from
this conduct, that ſhe never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to give him the entire aſcendant
over his rivals, and might learn thence the neceſſity of moderation and
caution. But his temper was too high for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; his behaviour too
open and candid to practice the arts of a court; and his free ſallies, while
they rendered him only more amiable in the eyes of good judges, gave his
enemies many advantages againſt him.</p>

p. 549.</note>. Elizabeth took care, by the mouth of Sir Thomas Egerton, lord
keeper, to inform this aſſembly of the neceſſity of a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. She
ſaid, that the wars formerly waged in Europe, had commonly been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by
the parties without farther view than to gain a few towns, or at moſt a
province, from each other; but the object of the preſent hoſtilities, on
the part of Spain, was no other than utterly to bereave England of her
religion, her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and her independance: That theſe bleſſings,
however, ſhe had hitherto been enabled to preſerve, in ſpite of the
devil, the pope, and the Spaniſh tyrant, and all the miſchievous deſigns
of all her enemies: That in this conteſt ſhe had diſburſed a ſum
treble to all the parliamentary ſupplies granted her; and beſides expending
her ordinary revenues, had been obliged to ſell many of the crown lands: And
that ſhe could not doubt, but her ſubjects, in a cauſe where their own
honour and intereſt were ſo deeply concerned, would willingly contribute to
ſuch moderate taxations as would be found requiſite for their common
defence<note n="†" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 525, 527. Townſend, p.
79.</note>. The commons granted her three ſubſidies and ſix fifteenths;
the ſame ſupply which had been given four years before, but which had then
appeared ſo unuſual, that they had voted it ſhould never afterwards be
regarded as a precedent.</p>
               <p>THE commons, this ſeſſion, ventured to engage in two
controverſies about forms with the houſe of peers; a prelude to thoſe
encroachments which, as they aſſumed more courage, they afterwards made
upon the prerogatives of the crown. They complained, that the lords failed in
civility to them, by receiving their <pb n="670" facs="tcp:0429000102:275"/> meſſages
ſitting with their hats on; and that the keeper returned an anſwer in the
ſame negligent poſture: But the upper houſe proved, to their full
ſatisfaction, that they were not intitled by cuſtom, and the uſage of
Parliament, to any more reſpect<note n="†" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p.
539, 540, 580, 585. Townſend, p 93, 94, 95.</note>. Some amendments had been
made by the lords, on a bill ſent up by the commons; and theſe amendments
were wrote on parchment, and returned with the bill to the commons. The lower
houſe took umbrage at the novelty: They pretended, that theſe amendments
ought to have been wrote on paper, not on parchment; and they complained of
this innovation to the peers. The peers replied, that they expected not ſuch
a frivolous objection from the gravity of the houſe; and that it was not
material, whether the amendments were wrote on parchment or on paper, nor
whether the paper was white, black, or brown. The commons were offended with
this reply, which ſeemed to contain a mocquery of them; and they complained
of it, tho' without obtaining any ſatisfaction<note n="‡" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 576, 577.</note>.</p>
               <p>AN application was made, by way of petition, to the Queen, from
the lower houſe, againſt monopolies; an abuſe which had riſen to an
enormous height; and they received a gracious, tho' a general anſwer; for
which they returned their thankful acknowlegements<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 570, 573.</note>. But not to give them too great

<q rend="inline">"That with regard to theſe patents, ſhe

ſoreſee, that parliamentary ſupplies would now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more neceſſary
to her than ever; and that the chief burthen of the war with Spain would
thenceforth lie on England. Henry had received an overture for a peace with
Philip; but before he would proceed to a negociation, he gave intelligence of
it to his allies, the Queen and the States; that, if poſſible, a
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification might be made by common conſent and agreement. Theſe two
powers ſent ambaſſadors to France, in order to remonſtrate againſt
peace with Spain; the Queen, Sir Robert Cecil, and Henry Herbert; the States,
Juſtin Naſſau, and John Barnevelt. Henry ſaid to theſe miniſters,
that his moſt early education <pb n="671" facs="tcp:0429000102:276"/> had been amidſt war
and danger, and he had paſſed the whole courſe of his life either in arms
or in military preparations: That after the proofs which he had given of his
alacrity in the field, no one could doubt, but he would willingly, for his
part, have continued in a courſe of life, to which he was now habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,
till the common enemy was reduced to ſuch a condition as no longer to give
umbrage either to him or to his allies: That no private intereſt of his own,
not even that of his people, nothing but the moſt inevitable neceſſity,
could ever induce him to think of a ſeparate peace with Philip, or make him
embrace meaſures which were not entirely formed with the approbation of all
his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: That his kingdom, torne with the convulſions and civil
wars of near half a century, required ſome interval of repoſe, ere it could
reach a condition in which it might ſuſtain itſelf, much more ſupport
its allies: That after the minds of his ſubjects were compoſed to
tranquillity and accuſtomed to obedience, after his finances were brought
into order, and after agriculture and the arts were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, France,
inſtead of being a burthen, as at preſent, to her confederates, would be
able to lend them effectual ſuccours, and amply to repay them all the
aſſiſtance which ſhe had received during her calamities: And that if
the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spain would not at preſent grant them ſuch terms as they
ſhould think reaſonable, he hoped, that, in a little time, he ſhould
attain ſuch a ſituation as would enable him to mediate more effectually,
and with more deciſive autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in their behalf.</p>
               <p>THE ambaſſadors were ſenſible, that theſe reaſons
were not feigned; and they therefore remonſtrated with the leſs vehemence
againſt the meaſures which, they ſaw, Henry was determined to purſue.
The States knew, that that monarch was intereſted never to permit their final
ruin; and having received private aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that he would ſtill,
notwithſtanding the peace, give them aſſiſtance, both of men and money,
they were well pleaſed to remain on terms of amity with him. His greateſt
concern was to give ſatisfaction to Elizabeth for this breach of treaty. He
had a cordial eſteem for that princeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ſympathy of manners, and a
gratitude for the extradinary favours which he had received from her, during
his greateſt difficulties: And he uſed every expedient to apologize and
atone for that meaſure, which neceſſity extorted from him. 
<note place="margin">Peace of Vervins.</note> But as Spain
refuſed to treat with the Dutch as a free ſtate, and Elizabeth would not
negociate without her ally, Henry found himſelf obliged to conclude, at
Vervins, a ſeparate peace, by which he recovered poſſeſſion of all
the places ſeized by Spain during the courſe of the civil wars, and
procured himſelf leizure to attend to the domeſtic ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his
kingdom. His capacity for the arts of peace were not inferior to his military
talents; and, in a little time, by his frugality, order, and wiſe
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <pb n="672" facs="tcp:0429000102:277"/> he raiſed France, from the deſolation
and miſery in which ſhe was at preſent involved, to a more flouriſhing
condition than ſhe had ever before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
               <p>THE Queen knew, that it would be alſo in her power, whenever
ſhe pleaſed, to conclude the war on equitable terms, and that Philip,
having no pretenſions upon her, would be glad to free himſelf from an enemy
who had foiled him in every conteſt, and who had it ſtill ſo much in her
power to make him feel the weight of her arms. Some of her wiſeſt
counſellors, particularly the lord treaſurer, adviſed her to embrace
pacific meaſures; and ſet before her the advantages of tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
ſecurity, and frugality, as more conſiderable than any ſucceſs which
could attend the greateſt victories. But that high-ſpirited princeſs,
tho' ſhe was at firſt averſe to the war, ſeemed now to have attained
ſuch an aſcendant over the enemy, that ſhe was unwilling to ſtop the
courſe of her proſperous fortune. She conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that her ſituation,
and her paſt victories, had given her entire ſecurity againſt any
dangerous invaſion; and the war muſt henceforth be conducted by ſudden
enterprizes, and naval expeditions, in which ſhe poſſeſſed an
undoubted ſuperiority: That the weak condition of Philip in the Indies opened
to her the view of the moſt deſirable advantages; and the yearly return of
his treaſure by ſea, afforded a continual proſpect of important, tho'
more temporary, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes: That, after his peace with France, if ſhe
alſo ſhould conſent to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, he would be able to turn all
his force againſt the revolted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Netherlands, which, tho'
they had ſurprizingly increaſed their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by commerce and good
government, were ſtill unable, if not ſupported by their confederates, to
maintain the war againſt ſo mighty a monarchy: And that as her defence of
that commonwealth was the original ground of the quarrel, it was unſafe, as
well as diſhonourable, to abandon their cauſe, till ſhe had placed them
in a ſtate of greater ſecurity.</p>
               <p>THESE reaſons were frequently inculcated on her by the earl of
Eſſex, whoſe paſſion for glory, as well as his military talents, made
him earneſtly deſire the continuance of that war from which he expected to
reap ſo much advantage and diſtinction. The rivalſhip between this
nobleman and lord Burleigh, made each of them inſiſt the more
ſtrenuouſly on his own councils; 
<note place="margin">The earl of

                     </gap>.</note> and as Eſſex's
perſon was agreeable to the Queen, as well as his advice conformable to her
inclinations, the favourite ſeemed daily to acquire an aſcendant over the
miniſter. Had he been endowed with caution and ſelf-command, equal to his
ſhining qualities, he would have ſo riveted himſelf in the Queen's
conſidence, that none of his enemies had ever been able to impeach his
credit: But his lofty ſpirit could ill ſubmit to that implicit deference
which her temper required, and which ſhe had ever been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed 
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:0429000102:278"/> to receive from all her ſubjects. Being once engaged
in a diſpute with her, about the choice of a governor for Ireland, he was
ſo heated in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he entirely forgot the rules both of duty
and civility; and turned his back upon her in a contemptuous manner. Her anger,
which was naturally prompt and violent, roſe at this provocation; and ſhe
inſtantly gave him a box in the ear; adding a paſſionate expreſſion,
ſuited to his impertinence. Inſtead of recollecting himſelf, and making
the ſubmiſſions due to her ſex and ſtation, he clapped his hand on
his ſword, and ſwore he would not bear ſuch uſage, were it from Henry
the eighth himſelf; and, in a great paſſion, he immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from court. Egerton, the chancellor, who loved Eſſex, exhorted him to
repair his indiſcretion by proper acknowlegements; and entreated him not to
give that triumph to his enemies, that affliction to his friends, as muſt
enſue by his ſupporting a conteſt with his ſovereign, and deſerting
the ſervice of his country: But Eſſex was deeply ſtung with the
diſhonour which he had received; and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think, that an inſult
which might be pardoned a woman, was become a mortal affront when it came from
his ſovereign. 
<q rend="inline">"If the vileſt of all indignities," ſaid he,
"is done me, does religion enforce me to ſue for pardon? Doth God require it?
Is it impiety not to do it? Why? Cannot princes err? Cannot ſubjects receive

ſubſcribe to theſe principles. Let Solomon's fool laugh when he is
ſtricken; let thoſe that mean to make their profit of princes, ſhew no

heavieſt puniſhment without trial or hearing. Since then I muſt either
anſwer your lordſhip's argument, or elſe forſake mine own juſt
defence. I will force mine aching head to do me ſervice for an hour. I muſt
firſt deny my diſcontent, which was forced, to be an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous
diſcontent; and that it was unſeaſonable or is of ſo long continuing,
your lordſhip ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condole with me than expoſtulate: Natural
ſeaſons are expected here below; but violent and unreaſonable ſtorms
come from above: There is no tempeſt equal to the paſſionate indignation
of a prince; nor yet at any time ſo unſeaſonable as when it ſighteth on
thoſe that might expect a harveſt of their careful and painful labours. He
that is once wounded, muſt needs feel ſmart, till his hurt is cured, or the
part hurt become ſenſeleſs: But cure I expect none, her majeſty's heart
being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate againſt me; and be without ſenſe I cannot, being of
fleſh and blood. But, ſay you, I may aim at the end: I do more than aim;
for I ſee an end of all my fortunes, I have ſet an end to all my deſires.
In this courſe do I any thing for my enemies? When I was at court, I found
them abſolute; and, therefore, I had rather they ſhould triumph alone, than
have me attendant upon their chariots. Or do I leave my friends? When I was a
courtier, I could yield them no fruit of my love unto them; and now, that I am
a hermit, they ſhall bear no envy for their love towards me. Or do I
forſake myſelf, becauſe I do enjoy myſelf? Or do I overthrow my
fortunes, becauſe I build not a fortune of paper walls, which every puff of
wind bloweth down? Or do I ruinate mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, becauſe I leave following
the purſuit, or wearing the falſe badge or mark of the ſhadow of honour?
Do I give courage or comfort to the foreign foe, becauſe I reſerve myſelf
to encounter with him? Or becauſe I keep my heart from buſineſs, tho' I
cannot keep my fortune from declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? No, no, my good lord, I give every one
of theſe conſiderations its due weight; and the more I weigh them, the more
I find myſelf juſtified from offending in any of them. As for the two
laſt objections, that I forſake my country, when it hath moſt need of me,
and fail in that indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty which I owe to my ſovereign; I
anſwer, that if my country had at this time any need of my public ſervice,
her majeſty, that governeth it, would not have driven me to a private life. I
am tied to my country by two bonds; one public, to diſcharge carefully and
induſtriouſly that truſt which is committed to me; the other private, to
ſacrifice for it my life and carcaſs, which hath been nouriſhed in it. Of
the firſt I am free, being diſmiſſed, diſcharged, and diſabled by
her majeſty: Of the other, nothing can free me but death; and therefore no
occaſion of my performance ſhall ſooner offer itſelf but I ſhall meet
it half way. The indiſſoluble duty which I owe unto her majeſty, is only
the duty of allegiance, which I never have, nor ever can fail in: The duty of
attendance, is no indiſſoluble duty. I owe her majeſty the duty of an
earl and of lord marſhal of England. I have been content to do her majeſty
the ſervice of a clerk; but I can never ſerve her as a villain or a
ſlave. But yet you ſay I muſt give way unto the time. So I do; for now
that I ſee the ſtorm come, I have put myſelf into the harbour.

his own indiſcretion could thenceforth have ſhaken his well eſtabliſhed

equally regretted by his ſovereign and the people. He had riſen gradually,
from ſmall beginnings, by the mere force of merit; and tho' his authority was

indefatigable application in buſineſs: Virtues, which, if they do not
always enable a man to riſe to high ſtations, do certainly qualify him
beſt for filling them. Of all the Queen's miniſters he was the only one who
left a conſiderable fortune to his poſterity; a fortune not acquired by
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine or oppreſſion, but gained by the regular profits of his offices,

able miniſter was the concluding a new treaty with the Dutch; who, after
being, in ſome meaſure, deſerted by the King of France, were glad to
preſerve the Queen's alliance, by ſubmitting to any terms which ſhe
pleaſed to require of them. The debt which they owed the Queen, was now fixed
at eight hundred thouſand pounds: Of this ſum they agreed to pay, during
the war, thirty thouſand pounds a year; and theſe payments were to continue
till four hundred thouſand pounds of the debt ſhould be extinguiſhed.
They engaged alſo, during the time that England ſhould continue the war
with Spain, to pay the garriſon of the cautionary towns. They ſtipulated,
that, if Spain ſhould invade England, or the iſle of Wight, or Jerſey or
Scilly, they ſhould aſſiſt her with a body of five thouſand foot, and
five hundred horſe; and that in caſe ſhe undertook any naval armament
againſt Spain, they ſhould join an equal number of ſhips to hers<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. XVI. p. 340.</note>. By this treaty the Queen
was eaſed of an annual charge of an hundred and twenty thouſand pounds.</p>

Queen, who regreted extremely the loſs of ſo wiſe and faithful a
miniſter, was informed of the death of her capital enemy, Philip the
ſecond; who, after languiſhing under many infirmities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in an
advanced age at Madrid. This haughty prince, deſirous of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
with his revolted ſubjects in the Netherlands, but diſdaining to make in
his own name the conceſſions requiſite for that purpoſe, had
transferred to his daughter, married to the archduke Albert, the property of
the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try provinces; but as it was not expected, that that princeſs
could have any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and as the reverſion, in caſe of the failure
of her iſſue, was ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>reſerved to the crown of Spain, the States
conſidered this deed only as the change of a name, and perſiſted with
equal obſtinacy in their reſiſtance to the Spaniſh arms. The other
ſtates alſo of Europe made no diſtinction between the courts of
Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Madrid; and the ſecret oppoſition of France, as well as
the avowed force of England, continued to operate againſt the progreſs of
Albert, as it had done againſt that of Philip.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1599</label> THO' the dominion of the
Engliſh over Ireland, had been eſtabliſhed above four centuries, it may
ſafely be affirmed, that their authority had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been little more than
nominal. The Iriſh princes and nobles, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among themſelves, readily
paid the exterior marks of obeiſance to a power which they were not able to
reſiſt; but, as no durable force was ever kept on foot to retain them to
their duty, they relapſed ſtill into their former ſtate of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
Too weak to introduce order and obedience among the rude inhabitants, the
Engliſh authority was yet ſufficient to check the growth of any
enterprizing genius among the natives: And, tho' it could beſtow no true form
of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <pb n="677" facs="tcp:0429000102:282"/> it was able to prevent the riſe
of any ſuch form, from the internal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination or ſubjection of the
Iriſh.</p>
               <p>MOST of the Engliſh inſtitutions likewiſe, by which that
iſland was governed, were to the laſt degree abſurd, and ſuch as no
ſtate before had ever thought of, for the preſerving dominion over its
conquered provinces.</p>
               <p>THE Engliſh nation, all on fire for the project of ſubduing
France, a project, whoſe ſucceſs was the moſt improbable, and would to
them have proved the moſt pernicious; neglected all other enterprizes, to
which their ſituation ſo ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them, and which, in time,
would have brought them an acceſſion of riches, grandeur, and ſecurity.
The ſmall army which they maintained in Ireland, they never ſupplied
regularly with pay; and as no money could be levied from the iſland, which
poſſeſſed none, they gave their ſoldiers the privilege of free
quarter upon the natives. Rapine and inſolence inflamed the hatred, which
prevailed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the conquerors and the conquered: Want of ſecurity among
the Iriſh, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing deſpair, nouriſhed ſtill farther the ſloth,
ſo natural to that uncultivated people.</p>
               <p>BUT the Engliſh carried farther their ill-judged tyranny.
Inſtead of inviting the Iriſh to adopt the more civilized cuſtoms of
their conquerors, they even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, tho' earneſtly ſollicited, to
communicate to them the privilege of their laws, and every where marked them
out as aliens and as enemies. Thrown out of the protection of juſtice, the
natives could find ſecurity no where but in force; and flying the
neighbourhood of cities, which they could not approach with ſafety, they
ſheltered themſelves in their marſhes and foreſts from the inſolence
of their inhuman maſters. Being treated like wild beaſts, they became
ſuch; and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ardor of revenge to their yet untamed barbarity, they
grew every day more intractable and dangerous.</p>
               <p>AS the Engliſh princes eſteemed the conqueſt of the
diſperſed Iriſh to be more the object of time and patience than the
ſource of military glory, they willingly delegated that office to private
adventurers, who inliſting ſoldiers at their own charge, conquered
provinces of that iſland, which they converted to their own profit. Separate
juriſdictions and principalities were eſtabliſhed by theſe lordly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors: The power of peace and war was aſſumed: Military law was
exerciſed over the Iriſh, whom they ſubdued, and, by degrees, over the
Engliſh, by whoſe aſſiſtance they conquered: And, after their
dominion had once taken root, deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engliſh inſtitutions leſs
favourable to barbarous empire, they degenerated into mere Iriſh, and
abandoned the garb, language, manners and laws of their native country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="678" facs="tcp:0429000102:283"/> BY all this imprudent conduct of England,
the natives of its dependant ſtate, remained ſtill in that abject
condition, into which the northern and weſtern parts of Europe were ſunk,
before they received civility and ſlavery from the refined policy and
irreſiſtible bravery of Rome. Even at the end of the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
when every chriſtian nation was cultivating with ardour every civil art of
life, that iſland, lying in a temperate climate, enjoying a fertile ſoil,
acceſſible in its ſituation, poſſeſſed of innumerable harbours,
was ſtill, notwithſtanding theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, inhabited by a people,
whoſe cuſtoms and manners approached nearer thoſe of ſavages than of
barbarians.</p>
               <p>AS the brutality and ignorance of the Iriſh was extreme, they
were ſunk below the reach of that curioſity and love of novelty, by which
every other people in Europe had been ſeized at the beginning of that
century, and which had engaged them in innovations and religious diſputes,
with which they were ſtill ſo violently agitated. The antient
ſuperſtition, the practices and obſervances of their fathers, mingled and
polluted with many wild opinions, ſtill maintained an unſhaken em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over
them; and the example alone of the Engliſh was ſufficient to render the
reformation odious to the prejudiced and diſcontented Iriſh. The old
oppoſition of manners, laws, and intereſt, was now inflamed by religious
antipathy; and the ſubduing and civilizing that country ſeemed to become
every day more difficult and more impracticable.</p>
               <p>THE animoſity againſt the Engliſh was carried ſo far by
the Iriſh, that, in an inſurrection, raiſed by two ſons of the earl of
Clanricard, they put to the ſword the whole inhabitants of the town of
Athenry, tho' Iriſh; becauſe they began to conform themſelves to
Engliſh cuſtoms and inſtitutions, and had embraced a more cultivated and
civilized form of life, than had been practiſed by their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
anceſtors<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 457.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE uſual revenue of Ireland amounted only to ſix thouſand
pounds a year<note n="†" place="bottom">Memoirs of the Sydneys, vol. I. p.
86.</note>: The Queen, tho' with much repining<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cox, p. 342. Sydney, vol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I p. 85, 200.</note>, commonly
added twenty thouſand more, which ſhe remitted from England: And with this
ſmall revenue, a body of one thouſand men was ſupported, which, in
extraordinary emergencies, was augmented to two thouſand<note n="‖" place="bottom">Camden, p. 542. Sydney, vol. I. p. 65, 109, 183, 184.</note>. No
wonder, that a force, ſo diſproportioned to the occaſion, inſtead of
ſubduing a mutinous kingdom, ſerved rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the natives, and to
excite thoſe frequent inſurrections and rebellions, which ſtill farther
inflamed the animoſity between the two nations, and encreaſed the barbarity
and diſorders, to which the Iriſh were naturally ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="679" facs="tcp:0429000102:284"/> IN 1560, Shan O'Neale, or the great
O'Neale, as the Iriſh called him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe head of that potent clan,
raiſed a rebellion in Ulſter; and after ſome ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, was
received into favour, upon his ſubmiſſion, and his promiſe of a more
dutiful behaviour for the future<note n="‖" place="bottom">Camden, p. 385,
391.</note>. This impunity tempted him to undertake a new inſurrection in
1567; but being puſhed by Sir Henry Sidney, lord deputy, he retreated into
Clandeboy, and rather than ſubmit to the Engliſh, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into
the hands of ſome Scotch iſlanders, who commonly infeſted thoſe parts
by their incurſions. The Scotch, who retained a quarrel againſt him on
account of former injuries, violated the laws of hoſpitality, and murdered
him in a feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, to which they had invited him. He was a man equally noted
for his pride, his violences, his debaucheries, and his hatred of the Engliſh
nation. He is ſaid to have put ſome of his followers to death, becauſe
they endeavoured to introduce the uſe of bread after the Engliſh
faſhion<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 409.</note>. Tho' ſo violent
an enemy to luxury, he was extremely addicted to riot; and was accuſtomed,
after his intemperance had thrown him into a fever, to plunge his body into
mire, that he might allay the flame, which he had raiſed by former
exceſſes<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 409. Cox, p. 324.</note>.
Such was the life led by this haughty barbarian, who ſcorned the title of
earl of Tyrone, which Elizabeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have reſtored to him, and who
aſſumed the rank and appellation of King of Ulſter. He uſed alſo to
ſay, that tho' the Queen was his ſovereign lady, he never made peace with
her but at her ſeeking<note n="¶" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 321.</note>.</p>
               <p>SIR Henry Sidney was one of the wiſeſt and moſt active
governors whom Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had enjoyed for ſeveral reigns<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 350.</note>; and he poſſeſſed his authority
eleven years; during which time, he ſtruggled with many difficulties, and
made ſome progreſs in repreſſing thoſe diſorders, which had become
inveterate among that people. The earl of Deſmond, in 1569, gave him
diſturbance from the hereditary ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity which prevailed between that
nobleman and the earl of Ormond, who was deſcended from the only family,
eſtabliſhed in Ireland, that had ever ſteddily maintained its loyalty to
the Engliſh crown<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 424.</note>. The
earl of Thomond, in 1570, attempted a rebellion in Connaught, but was obliged
to fly into France, before his deſigns were ripe for execution. Stukeley,
another fugitive, found ſuch credit with the pope, Gregory the 13th, that he
flattered his holineſs with the proſpect of making his nephew, Buon
Compagno, King of Ireland; and as it this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject had already taken effect, he
accepted the title of marqueſs of Leinſter from the new ſovereign<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 430. Cox, p. 354.</note>. He paſſed next
into Spain; and after having received much encouragement and great rewards from
Philip, who intended to make uſe of him as an inſtrument to diſturb Queen
Elizabeth, he was found to poſſeſs <pb n="680" facs="tcp:0429000102:285"/> too little
intereſt for executing thoſe high promiſes, which he had made to that
monarch. He retired into Portugal; and following the fortunes of Don
Sebaſtian, he periſhed with that gallant prince in his bold but fatal
expedition againſt the Moors.</p>
               <p>LORD Gray ſucceeded Sydney in the government of Ireland; and,
in 1579, ſuppreſſed a new rebellion of the earl of Deſmond, tho'
ſupported by a body of Spaniards and Italians. The rebellion of the Bourks
followed a few years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; occaſioned by the ſtrict and equitable
adminiſtration of Sir Richard Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, governor of Connaught, who
endeavoured to repreſs the tyranny of the chieftains over their
vaſſals<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 720.</note>. The Queen, finding
Ireland ſo burthenſome to her, tried ſeveral expedients for reducing it
to a ſtate of greater order and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. She encouraged the earl of
Eſſex, father to that nobleman, who was afterwards her favourite, to
attempt the ſubduing and planting Clandeboy, Ferny and other territories,
part of ſome late forfeitures: But that enterprize proved unfortunate; and
Eſſex died of a diſtemper, occaſioned, as is ſuppoſed, by the
vexation, which he had conceived, from his diſappointments. An univerſity
was founded in Dublin with a view of introducing arts and learning into that
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and civilizing the uncultivated manners of the inhabitants<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 566.</note>. But the moſt unhappy
expedient, employed in the government of Ireland, was that made uſe of in
1585 by Sir John Perrot, at that time lord deputy: He put arms into the hands
of the Iriſh inhabitants of Ulſter, in order to enable them, without the
aſſiſtance of the government, to repreſs the incurſions of the Scotch
iſlanders, by which theſe parts were much infeſted<note n="‡" place="bottom">Nanton's Fragmenta Regalia, p. 203.</note>. At the ſame time,
the invitations of Philip, joined to their zeal for the catholic religion,
engaged many of the gentry to ſerve in the Low Country wars; and thus
Ireland, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided both of officers and ſoldiers, of diſcipline and
arms, became formidable to the Engliſh, and was able to maintain a more
regular war againſt her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient maſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Tyrone's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> HUGH O'Neale,
nephew to Shan O'Neale, had been raiſed by the Queen to the dignity of earl
of Tyrone; but having murdered his couſin, ſon to that rebel, and being
acknowledged head of his clan, he preferred the pride of barbarous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and
dominion, to the pleaſures of opulence and tranquillity, and fomented all
thoſe diſorders, by which he hoped to weaken or overturn the Engliſh
govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was noted for the vices of perfidy and cruelty, ſo common
among uncultivated nations; and was alſo eminent for courage, a virtue, which
their diſorderly courſe of life requires, and which, notwithſtanding,
being unſupported <pb n="681" facs="tcp:0429000102:286"/> by the principle of honour, is
commonly more precarious among them, than among a civilized people. Tyrone,
actuated by this ſpirit, ſecretly fomented the diſcontents of the
Maguires, Odonnels, O'Rourks, Macmahons, and other rebels; yet truſting to
the influence of his deceitful oaths and profeſſions, he put himſelf into
the hands of Sir William Ruſſel, who, in the year 1594, was ſent over
lord deputy into Ireland. Contrary to the advice and proteſtation of Sir
Henry Bagnal, marſhal of the army, he was diſmiſſed; and returning to
his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he embraced the reſolution of raiſing an open rebellion,
and of relying no longer on the lenity or inexperience of the Engliſh
government. He entered into a correſpondence with Spain: He procured thence a
ſupply of arms and ammunition: And having united all the Iriſh chieftains
in a dependance upon him, he began to be regarded as a formidable enemy.</p>
               <p>THE native Iriſh were ſo miſerably poor, that their
country afforded few other commodities but cattle and oatmeal, which were
eaſily deſtroyed or driven away on the approach of the enemy; and as
Elizabeth was averſe to the expence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for ſupporting her armies,
the Engliſh found much difficulty in puſhing their advantages, and in
purſuing the rebels into the bogs, woods, and other faſtneſſes, to
which they retreated. Theſe motives made Sir John Norris, who commanded the
Engliſh army, the more ready to hearken to any propoſals of accommodation
made him by Tyrone; and after the war was ſpun out by theſe artifices for
ſome years, that gallant Engliſhman, finding that he had been deceived by
treacherous promiſes, and that he had performed nothing worthy of his antient
reputation, was ſeized with a languiſhing diſtemper, and died of vexation
and diſcontent. Sir Henry Bagnal, who ſucceeded him in the command, was
ſtill more unfortunate. As he advanced to relieve the ſort of Black-water,
beſieged by the rebels, he was ſurrounded in diſadvantageous ground; his
ſoldiers, diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>couraged by their powder's accidentally taking fire, were put
to flight; and, tho' the purſuit was ſtopt by Montacute, who commanded the
Engliſh horſe, fifteen hundred men, together with the general himſelf,
were left dead upon the ſpot. This victory, ſo unuſual to the Iriſh,
mightily raiſed their ſpirits, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them with arms and ammunition,
and exalted the reputation of Tyrone, who aſſumed the character of the
deliverer of his country, and patron of Iriſh liberty<note n="*" place="bottom">Cox, p. 415.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Engliſh council were now ſenſible that the rebellion
in Ireland was come to a dangerous head, and that the former temporizing arts,
of granting truces and pacifications to the rebels, and of allowing them to
purchaſe pardons by reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the plunder, acquired during their
inſurrections, ſerved only to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <pb n="682" facs="tcp:0429000102:287"/> the
ſpirit of mutiny and diſorder among them. It was therefore reſolved to
puſh the war by vigorous meaſures; and the Queen caſt her eye on Charles
Blount, lord Mountjoy, as a man, who, tho' hitherto leſs accuſtomed to arms
than to books and literature, was endowed, ſhe thought, with talents equal to
that undertaking. But the young earl of Eſſex, ambitious of glory, and
deſirous of obtaining this government for himſelf, oppoſed the choice of
Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; and repreſented the neceſſity of appointing, for that
important employment, ſome perſon more experienced in war than this
nobleman, more practiſed in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of higher quality and
reputation. By this deſcription, he was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean himſelf<note n="†" place="bottom">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 512.</note>; and no ſooner was
his deſire known, to be poſſeſſed of that government, than his
enemies, even more zealouſly than his friends, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to render his
wiſhes effectual. Many of his friends thought, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould
conſent, except for a very ſhort time, to accept of employments which
muſt remove him from court, and prevent him from cultivating that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
inclination, which the Queen ſo viſibly bore him<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cabbaſa, p. 79.</note>. His enemies hoped, that if, by his
abſence, ſhe had once leizure to forget the charms of his perſon and
converſation, his impatient and lofty demeanor would ſoon diſguſt a
princeſs, who uſually exacted ſuch profound ſubmiſſion and implicit
obedience from all her ſervants. 
<note place="margin">Eſſex ſent over to Ireland.</note> But
Eſſex was incapable of entering into ſuch cautious views; and even
Elizabeth, who was extremely deſirous of ſubdoing the Iriſh rebels, and
who was much prepoſſeſſed in favour of Eſſex's genius, readily
agreed to appoint him governor of Ireland, under the title of lord lieutenant.
The more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him in his undertaking, ſhe granted him by his patent
more extenſive authority than had ever before been conferred on any
lieutenant; the power of carrying on or finiſhing the war as he pleaſed, of
pardoning the rebels, and of filling all the moſt conſiderable employments
of the kingdom<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 366.</note>. And to
enſure him of ſucceſs, ſhe levied a numerous army of ſixteen
thouſand foot and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred horſe, which ſhe afterwards augmented
to twenty thouſand foot and two thouſand horſe: A force, which, it was
apprehended, would be able, in one campaign, to overwhelm the rebels, and make
an entire conqueſt of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Nor did Eſſex's enemies, the earl of
Nottingham, lord admiral, Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Cecil, ſecretary, Sir Walter Raleigh,
and lord Cobham, throw any obſtacles in the way of theſe preparations; but
hoped, that the higher the Queen's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were raiſed of ſucceſs,
the more difficult it would be for the event to correſpond to them. In a like
view, they rather ſeconded, than oppoſed, thoſe exalted encomiums, which
Eſſex's numerous and ſanguine friends diſperſed, of 
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:0429000102:288"/> his high genius, of his elegant endowments, his heroic
courage, his unbounded generoſity, and his noble birth; nor were they
diſpleaſed to obſerve that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate fondneſs, which the people
every where expreſſed for this nobleman. Theſe artful politicians had
ſtudied his character; and finding, that his open and undaunted ſpirit, if
taught temper and reſerve from oppoſition, muſt become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, they
reſolved rather to give full breath to thoſe ſails, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
too much expanded, and to puſh him upon dangers, of which he ſeemed to make
ſuch ſmall account<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden. Oſborne, p
371.</note>. And the better to make advantage of his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, ſpies
were ſet upon all his actions and even expreſſions; and his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſpirit, which, while he was in the midſt of the court and environed by his
rivals, was unacquainted with diſguiſe, could not fail, after he thought
himſelf ſurrounded by none but friends, to give a pretence for malignant
ſuſpicions and conſtructions.</p>
               <p>Essex left London in the month of March, attended by the
acclamations of the populace, and what did him more honour, accompanied by a
numerous train of nobility and gentry, who, from affection to his perſon, had
attached them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all his fortunes, and propoſed to acquire fame and
military experience under ſo renowned a commander. The firſt act of
authority, which he exerciſed, after his arrival in Ireland, was an
indiſcretion, but of the generous kind; and in both theſe reſpects,
ſuitable to his character. He appointed his intimate friend, the earl of
Southampton, general of the horſe; a nobleman, who had diſpleaſed the
Queen by ſecretly marrying without her conſent, and whom ſhe had
therefore enjoined Eſſex not to employ in any command under him. She no
ſooner heard of this inſtance of diſobedience than ſhe reprimanded him,
and ordered him to recal his commiſſion to Southampton. But Eſſex, who
had imagined, that ſome reaſons, which he oppoſed to her firſt
injunctions, had convinced her, had the imprudence to remonſtrate againſt
theſe ſecond orders<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II p.

inſiſted upon leading his forces immediately into Ulſter againſt
Tyrone, the capital enemy; and his inſtructions had been drawn agreeable to
theſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared intentions and reſolutions. But the Iriſh
counſellors perſuaded him, that the ſeaſon was too early for the
enterprize, and that as the moraſſes, in which the Iriſh uſually
ſheltered themſelves, would not, as yet, be penetrable to the Engliſh
forces, it would be better to employ the preſent time in an expedition into
Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Their ſecret reaſon for this advice was, that many of them
poſſeſſed eſtates in that province, and were deſirous to have the
enemy diſlodged from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's
Memoirs, vol. II. p 448.</note>: But the ſame ſelfiſh ſpirit, which had
induced them to give this council, made them ſoon after diſown it, when
they found the bad conſequences with which it was attended<note n="†" place="bottom">Winwood, vol. I. p. 140.</note>.</p>
               <p>ESSEX obliged all the rebels of Munſter either to ſubmit or
to fly into the neighbouring provinces: But as the Iriſh, from the
greatneſs of the Queen's preparations, had concluded, that ſhe intended to
reduce them to total ſubjection, or even utterly to exterminate them, they
conſidered their preſent defence as a common cauſe; and the Engliſh
forces were no ſooner withdrawn, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Munſter
relapſed into rebellion, and renewed their confederacy with their other
countrymen. The army, meanwhile, by the fatigue of long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious marches,
and by the influence of the climate, was become extreme ſickly; and on their
return to Dublin, about the middle of July, were ſuprizingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed in
number. Their courage was even much abated: For tho' they had prevailed in
ſome leſſer enterprizes, as againſt the lord Cahir and others; yet had
they ſometimes met with a more ſtout reſiſtance than they expected from
the Iriſh, whom they were wont to deſpiſe; and as they were raw troops
and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, a conſiderable body of them had been put to flight at the
Glins, by an inferior number of the enemy: Eſſex was ſo enraged at this
miſbehaviour, that he caſhiered all the officers, and decimated the private
men<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cox, p. 421.</note>. But this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of
ſeverity, tho' neceſſary, had intimidated the ſoldiers, and had
encreaſed their averſion to the preſent ſervice.</p>
               <p>THE Queen was extremely diſguſted, when ſhe heard, that
ſo conſiderable a part of the ſeaſon was conſumed in theſe
frivolous enterprizes; and was ſtill more ſurprized, that Eſſex
perſevered in the ſame practice, which he had ſo much condemned in
others, and which he knew to be ſo much contrary to her purpoſe and
intention. That nobleman, in order to give his troops leizure to recruit from
their ſickneſs and fatigue, marched with a ſmall body of fifteen hundred
men into the county of Ophelie againſt the O'Connors and O'Mores, 
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:0429000102:290"/> whom he forced to a ſubmiſſion: But on his return
to Dublin, he found the army ſo extremely diminiſhed, that he wrote to the
Engliſh council an account of his condition, and informed them, that if he
received not immediately a reinforcement of two thouſand men, it would be
impoſſible for him this ſeaſon to attempt any thing againſt Tyrone.
That there might be no pretence for farther inactivity, the Queen immediately
ſent over the number demanded<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol.
II. p. 430. Cox, p. 421.</note>; and Eſſex began at laſt to aſſemble
his forces for the expedition into Ulſter. The army was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
averſe to this enterprize, and terrified with the reputation of Tyrone, that
many of them counterfeited ſickneſs, many of them deſerted<note n="†" place="bottom">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 112, 113.</note>; and
Eſſex found, that after leaving the neceſſary garriſons, he could
ſcarce lead four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men againſt the rebels. He marched, however,
with this ſmall army; but was ſoon ſenſible, that, in ſo advanced a
ſeaſon, it would be impoſſible for him to effectuate any thing
againſt an enemy, who, tho' ſuperior in number, were determined to avoid
every deciſive action. He hearkened, therefore, to a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſent him
by Tyrone, who deſired a conference; and a place, near the two camps, was
accordingly appointed. The generals met without any of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and a
river ran between them, into which Tyrone entered to the depth of his ſaddle:
But Eſſex ſtood on the oppoſite bank. After half an hour's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
where Tyrone behaved with great ſubmiſſion and reſpect to the lord
lieutenant, a ceſſation of arms was concluded to the firſt of May,
renewable from ſix weeks to ſix weeks; but which might be broke off by
either party upon a fortnight's warning<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p.
125.</note>. Eſſex alſo received from Tyrone propoſals for a peace, in
which that rebel had inſerted many unreaſonable and exorbitant conditions:
And there appeared afterwards ſome reaſon to ſuſpect, that he had here
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a very unjuſtifiable correſpondence with the enemy<note n="‖" place="bottom">Winwood, vol. I. p. 307. State Trials. Bacon, vol.
IV. p. 514, 535, 537.</note>.</p>
               <p>SO unexpected an iſſue of an enterprize, the greateſt and
moſt expenſive which Elizabeth had ever undertaken, provoked her extremely
againſt Eſſex; and this diſguſt was much augmented by other
circumſtances of that nobleman's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. He wrote many letters to the Queen
and council, full of peeviſh and impatient expreſſions; complaining of
his enemies, lamenting that their calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſhould be believed againſt
him, and diſcovering ſymptoms of a mind, equally haughty and
diſcontented. She took care to inform him of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction; but
commanded him to remain in Ireland till farther orders.</p>
               <p>ESSEX heard at once of Elizabeth's anger, and of the promotion
of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Sir Robert Cecil, to the office of maſter of the wards, an
office which he <pb n="686" facs="tcp:0429000102:291"/> himſelf aſpired to: And dreading,
that, if he remained any longer abſent, the Queen would be totally alienated
from him, he haſtily embraced a reſolution, which, he knew, had once
ſucceeded with the earl of Leiceſter, the former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Elizabeth.
Leiceſter being informed, while in the Low Countries, that his miſtreſs
was extremely diſpleaſed with his conduct, diſobeyed her orders by coming
over into England; and having pacified her by his preſence, by his apologies,
and by his flattery and inſinuation, diſappointed all the expectations of
his enemies<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 453.</note>. 
<note place="margin">Returns to England.</note> Eſſex,
therefore, weighing more the ſimilarity of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances than the
difference of characters between himſelf and Leiceſter, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſet
out for England; and making ſpeedy journeys, he arrived at court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any
one was in the leaſt apprized of his intentions<note n="†" place="bottom">Winwood, vol. I. p. 118.</note>. Tho' beſmeared with dirt and
ſweat, he haſtened up ſtairs to the preſence chamber, thence to the
privy chamber; nor ſtopped till he was in the Queen's bed chamber, who was
newly riſen, and was ſitting with her hair about her face. He threw
himſelf on his knees, kiſſed her hand, and had ſome private conference
with her; where he was ſo graciouſly received, that on his departure he was
heard to expreſs great ſatisfaction, and to thank God, that, tho' he had
ſuffered much trouble and many ſtorms abroad, he found a ſweet calm at
home<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p.
127.</note>.</p>
               <p>But this placability of Elizabeth was merely the reſult of her
ſurprize, and of the momentary ſatisfaction, which ſhe felt on the
ſudden and unexpected ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of her favourite: After ſhe had found
leizure for recollection, all his faults recurred to her memory; and ſhe
thought it neceſſary by ſome ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, to ſubdue this
haughty and imperious ſpirit, who, preſuming on her partiality and
indulgence, had pretended to domineer in her councils, to engroſs all her
favour, and to act in the moſt important affairs, without regard to her
orders and inſtructions. 
<note place="margin">Is diſgraced.</note> When Eſſex waited
on her in the afternoon, he found her extremely altered in her carriage towards
him: She ordered him to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined to his chamber; to be twice examined by
the council; and tho' his anſwers were calm and ſubmiſſive, ſhe
committed him to the cuſtody of the lord keeper, Egerton, and held him
ſequeſtered from all company, even from that of his counteſs, nor was
ſo much as the intercourſe of letters permitted between them. Eſſex
dropped many expreſſions of humiliation and ſorrow, none of reſentment:
He proſeſſed an entire ſubmiſſion to the Queen's will: Declared his
intention of retiring into the country, and of leading thenceforth a private
life, remote from courts and buſineſs: But tho' he aſſected to be ſo
entirely cured of his aſpiring <pb n="687" facs="tcp:0429000102:292"/> ambition, the vexation
of this diſappointment, and of the triumph gained by his enemies, preyed upon
his haughty ſpirit; and he ſell into a diſtemper, which ſeemed to put
his life in hazard.</p>
               <p>THE Queen had always declared to all the world, and even to the
earl himſelf, that the purpoſe of her ſeverity was to correct, not to
ruin him<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, p. 444, 445. Sydney Papers,
vol. II. p. 106.</note>; and when ſhe heard of his condition, ſhe was not a
little alarm d with the danger. She ordered eight phyſicians of the beſt
reputation and experience to conſult of his caſe; and being informed, that
the iſſue was much to be apprehended, ſhe ſent Dr. James to him with
ſome broth, and deſired that phyſician to deliver him a meſſage,
which ſhe probably deemed of ſtill greater virtue; that, if ſhe thought
ſuch a ſtep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with her honour, ſhe would herſelf pay him
a viſit. The by ſtanders, who carefully obſerved her countenance,
remarked, that in pronouncing theſe words, her eyes were ſuffuſed with
tears<note n="†" place="bottom">Sydney Letters, vol. II. p.
151.</note>.</p>
               <p>WHEN theſe ſymptoms of the Queen's returning affection
toward's Eſſex were known, they gave a ſenſible alarm to the faction
which had declared their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to him. Sir Walter Raleigh, in
particular, the moſt violent as well as the moſt ambitious of his enemies,
was ſo affected with the appearance of that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den revolution, that he was
ſeized with ſickneſs in his turn, and the Queen was obliged to apply the
ſame ſalve to his wound, and to ſend him a favourable meſſage,
expreſſing her deſire of his recovery<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 139.</note>.</p>

adminiſtered to theſe aſpiring rivals, was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful with both; and
Eſſex, being now allowed the company of his counteſs, and having
entertained more promiſing hopes of his future fortunes, was ſo much
reſtored in his health, as to be thought paſt all danger. A belief was
infuſed into into Elizabeth, that his diſtemper had been entirely
counterſeit, in order to move her compaſſion<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 153.</note>; and ſhe relapſed into her former rigour
againſt him. He wrote her a letter, and ſent her a rich preſent on
New-Year's day; as was uſual among the courtiers of that time: She read the

conſiſted in her company, and in reading with her thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
and entertaining authors which, even during the time of his greateſt
proſperity, he had never entirely neglected.</p>
               <p>THERE were ſeveral incidents which kept alive the Queen's
anger againſt Eſſex. Every account which ſhe received from Ireland,
convinced her more and more of his miſconduct in that government, and of the
inſignificant purpoſes to which he had employed ſo much force and
treaſure. Tyrone, ſo far from being quelled, had thought proper, in leſs
than three months, to break the truce, and joining with O Donel, and other
rebels, had over-run almoſt the whole kingdom. He boaſted, that he was
certain of receiving a ſupply of men, money, and arms from Spain: He
pretended to be champion of the catholic religion: And he loudly exulted in the
preſent of a phaenix plume, which the pope, Clement the eighth, in order to
encourage him in the proſecution of ſo good a cauſe, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated,
and had conferred upon him<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p.
617.</note>. The Queen, that ſhe might check his progreſs, returned to her
former intention, of appointing Mountjoy lord-deputy; and tho' that nobleman,
who was an intimate friend of Eſſex, and deſired his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the
government of Ireland, did at firſt very earneſtly excuſe himſelf, on
account of his bad ſtate of health, ſhe obliged him to accept of that
employment. Mountjoy found the iſland almoſt in a deſperate ſituation;
but being a man of capacity and vigour, he was ſo little diſcouraged, that
he immediately advanced againſt Tyrone in Ulſter. He penetrated into the
heart of that country, the chief ſeat of the rebels: He fortified Derry and
Mount-Norris, in order to bridle the Iriſh: He chaced them from the field,
and obliged them to take ſhelter in the woods and moraſſes: He employed,
with equal ſucceſs, Sir George Carew in Munſter: And by theſe
promiſing ſucceſſes, he gave new life to the Queen's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in that
country.</p>
               <p>AS the compariſon of Mountjoy's adminiſtration with that of
Eſſex, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to alienate her from her favourite, ſhe received
additional diſguſt from the partiality of the people, who,
prepoſſeſſed with an extravagant idea of Eſſex's merit, complained
of the injuſtice which was done him, by his removal from court, and by his
conſinement. Libels were ſecretly diſperſed againſt Cecil and 
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:0429000102:294"/> Raleigh, and all his enemies. And his popularity, which
was always great, ſeemed rather to be increaſed than diminiſhed by his
misfortunes. Elizabeth, in order to juſtify to the public her conduct with
regard to him, had often taken the reſolution of having him tried in the
ſtar-chamber, for his offences: But her tenderneſs for him prevailed at
laſt over her ſeverity; and ſhe was contented to have him only examined
by the privy-council. The attorney-general, Coke, opened the cauſe againſt
him, and treated him with the cruelty and inſolence which that great lawyer
uſually exerciſed againſt the unfortunate. He diſplayed, in the
ſtrongeſt colours, all the faults committed by Eſſex in his
adminiſtration of Ireland: His making Southampton general of the horſe,
contrary to the Queen's injunctions; his deſerting the enterprize againſt
Tyrone, and marching to Leinſter and Munſter; his conferring knighthood on
too many perſons; his ſecret conference with Tyrone; and his ſudden
return from Ireland, in contempt of her majeſty's commands. He alſo
exaggerated the indignity of the conditions which Tyrone had been allowed to
propoſe; odious and abominable conditions, ſaid he; a public toleration of
an idolatrous religion, pardon for himſelf and every traitor in Ireland, and
full reſtitution of lands and poſſeſſions to all of them<note n="†" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 449.</note>. The
ſollicitor-general, Fleming, inſiſted upon the wretched ſituation in
which the earl had left that kingdom; and Francis Bacon, ſon to Sir Nicholas
Bacon, who had been lord keeper in the beginning of the preſent reign,
cloſed the charge with diſplaying the undutiful expreſſions contained
in ſome letters wrote by the earl.</p>
               <p>ESSEX, when his turn came to plead in his own behalf, renounced,
with great ſubmiſſion and humility, all pretenſions to an apology<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200.</note>; and
declared his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution never, on this or any other occaſion, to have any
conteſt with his ſovereign. He ſaid, that having ſevered himſelf from
the world, and abjured all ſentiments of ambition, he had no ſcruple to
confeſs every failing or error into which his youth, folly, or manifold
infirmities might have betrayed him; that his inward ſorrow for his offences
againſt her majeſty was ſo profound, that it exceeded all his outward
croſſes and afflictions, nor did he retain any ſcruple of ſubmitting to
a public confeſſion of whatever ſhe had been pleaſed to impute to him;
that in his acknowlegements he retained only one reſerve, which he never
would relinquiſh but with his life, the aſſertion of a loyal and
unpolluted heart, of an unfeigned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, of an earneſt deſire ever to
perform to her majeſty the beſt ſervice which his poor abilities would
permit; and that if this ſentiment was recognized by the council, he
willingly acquieſced in any condemnation or ſentence which 
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:0429000102:295"/> they could pronounce againſt him. This
ſubmiſſion was uttered with ſo much eloquence, and in ſo pathetic a
manner, that it drew tears from many of the ſpectators<note n="‖" place="bottom">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200, 201.</note>. All the
privy-counſellors, in giving their judgment, made no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of doing the
earl juſtice, with regard to the loyalty of his intentions. Even Cecil, whom
he believed his capital enemy, treated him with regard and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. And the
ſentence given by the lord keeper, (to which the council aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented) was
in theſe words. 
<q rend="inline">"If this cauſe," ſaid he, "had been heard in
the Star-chamber, my ſentence muſt have been for as great a fine as ever
was ſet upon any man's head in that court, together with perpetual
confinement in that priſon which belongeth to a man of his quality, the
Tower. But ſince we are now in another place, and in a courſe of favour, my
cenſure is, that the earl of Eſſex is not to execute the office of a
counſellor, nor that of earl mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of England, nor of maſter of the
ordinance; and to return to his own houſe, there to continue a priſoner,
till it ſhall pleaſe her majeſty to releaſe this and all the reſt of
his ſentence<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 454.

                        </gap>, 627.</note>."</q>
The earl of Cumberland made a ſlight oppoſition to this ſentence; and
ſaid, that if he thought it would ſtand, he would have required a little
longer time to deliberate, that he thought it ſomewhat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and that
any commander in chief might eaſily incur a like penalty. But, however, added
he, in confidence of her majeſty's mercy, I agree with the reſt. The earl
of Worceſter delivered his opinion in a couple of Latin verſes, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that, where the Gods are offended, even misfortunes ought to be imputed as
crimes, and that accident is no excuſe for tranſgreſſions againſt the
Divinity.</p>
               <p>BACON, ſo much diſtinguiſhed afterwards by his high
offices, and ſtill more by his profound genius for the ſciences, was nearly
allied to the Cecil family, being nephew to lord Burleigh, and couſin-german
to the ſecretary: But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his extraordinary talents, he had
met with ſo little protection from his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful relations, that he had not
yet obtained any preferment in the law, which was his profeſſion. But
Eſſex, who could diſtinguiſh merit, and who paſſionately loved it,
had entered into an intimate friendſhip with Bacon; had zealouſly
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, tho' without ſucceſs, to procure him the office of Queen's
ſollicitor; and in order to comfort his friend under the diſappointment,
had conferred on him a preſent of land to the value of eighteen hundred
pounds<note n="†" place="bottom">Cabbala, p. 78.</note>. The public could
ill excuſe Bacon's appearance before the council, againſt ſo munificent a
benefactor; tho' he acted in obedience to the Queen's orders: But ſhe was
ſo well pleaſed with his behaviour, that ſhe impoſed on him a new
taſk, of drawing <pb n="691" facs="tcp:0429000102:296"/> a narrative of that day's
proceedings, in order to ſatisfy the nation of the juſtice and lenity of
her conduct. Bacon, who wanted firmneſs of character, more than humanity,
gave to the whole tranſaction the moſt favourable turn for Eſſex; and,
in particular, painted out, in elaborate expreſſion, the dutiful
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which that nobleman diſcovered in the defence which he made
for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. When he read the paper to her, ſhe ſmiled at that
paſſage, and obſerved to Bacon, that old love, ſhe ſaw, could not
eaſily be forgotten. He replied, that he hoped ſhe meant that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ALL the world, indeed expected, that Eſſex would ſoon be
reinſtated in his former credit<note n="‖" place="bottom">Winwood, vol.
l. p. 251.</note>: Perhaps, as is uſual in reconcilements founded on
inclination, would acquire an additional aſcendant with the Queen, and after
all his dilgraces, would again appear more a favourite than ever. They were
confirmed in this hope, when they ſaw, that tho' he was ſtill prohibited to
appear at court<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II p 162.</note>,
he was continued in his office of maſter of horſe, and was reſtored to
his liberty, and that all his friends had acceſs to him. Eſſex himſelf
ſeemed determined to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in that conduct which had hitherto been
ſo ſucceſsful, and which the Queen, by all this diſcipline, had
endeavoured to render habitual to him: He wrote to her, that he kiſſed her
majeſty's hands, and the rod with which ſhe had corrected him; but that he
could never recover his uſual chearfulneſs, till ſhe deigned to admit him
to that preſence which had ever been the chief ſource of his happineſs
and enjoyment: And that he had now reſolved to make amends for his paſt
er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, to retire into a country ſolitude, and to ſay with Nebuchadnezzar,

<q rend="inline">"Let my dwelling be with the beaſts of the
field; let me eat graſs as an ox, and be wet with the dew of heaven; till it
ſhall pleaſe the Queen to reſtore me to my underſtanding."</q> The
Queen was much pleaſed with theſe ſentiments, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that ſhe
heartily wiſhed his actions might correſpond to his expreſſions; that
he had tried her patience a long time, and it was but juſt ſhe ſhould now
make ſome experiment of his ſubmiſſion; that her father would never

               <p>THE earl of Eſſex poſſeſſed a monopoly of ſweet

Eſſex's enemies, means were found to perſuade her, that his lofty
ſpirit was not yet ſufficiently humbled, and that he muſt undergo this

imagining that the Queen was entirely inexorable, burſt at once all

with a high hand againſt his ſovereign; and as this practice gratified his
own temper, and was ſometimes ſucceſsful, he had imprudently imagined,
that it was the only proper method of managing her<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Cabbala, p. 79.</note>: But being now reduced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, he
gave entire reins to his violent diſpoſition, and threw off all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

to increaſe the general good-will by an hoſpitable manner of life, little
ſuited to his ſituation and his circumſtances. His former employments had

he now entertained; by additional careſſes and civilities, a friendſhip

confidence of the catholics; but his chief truſt lay in the puritans, whom he
openly careſſed, and whoſe manners he ſeemed to have entirely adopted.
He engaged the moſt celebrated preachers of that ſect to reſort to
Eſſex-houſe; he had daily prayers and ſermons in his family; and he
invited all the zealots in London to attend thoſe pious exerciſes. Such was
the diſpoſition now beginning to prevail among the Engliſh, that,
inſtead of feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and public ſpectacles, the methods anciently
practiſed in commonwealths to gain the populace, nothing ſo effectually
ingratiated an ambitions leader with the public, as theſe fanatical

courtiers feigned love and deſire towards her, and addreſſed themſelves

fallen into diſgrace, wrote the following letter to his friend Sir Robert
Cecil, with a view, no doubt, of having it ſhewn to the Queen. 
<q rend="inline">"My heart was never broke till this day, that
I hear the Queen goes away ſo far off, whom I have followed ſo many years,

behind her in a dark priſon all alone. While ſhe was yet near at hand, that
I might hear of her once in two or three days, my ſorrows were the leſs;
but even now my heart is caſt into the depth of all miſery. I, that was

mortal. All thoſe times paſt, the loves, the ſighs, the ſorrows, the

Nymph, Venus, Goddeſs, Angel, was now about ſixty. Yet five or ſix years

                  <pb n="694" facs="tcp:0429000102:299"/> THERE was another expedient of Eſſex,
which, if poſſible, was more provoking to the Queen than thoſe
ſarcaſms on her age and deformity; and that was, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret applications
to the King of Scots, her heir and ſucceſſor. That prince had this year
very narrowly eſcaped a dangerous, tho' ill formed, conſpiracy of the earl
of Gowry; and even his delivery was attended with this diſagreeable
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that the obſtinate eccleſiaſtics perſiſted, in
ſpite of the moſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible evidence, to maintain to his face, that
there had been no ſuch conſpiracy. James, harraſſed with his turbulent
and factious ſubjects, caſt a wiſtful eye to the ſucceſſion of
England; and in proportion as the Queen advanced in years, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
increaſed of mounting that throne, on which, beſides acquiring a great
addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of power and ſplendor, he hoped to govern a people, ſo much more
tractable and ſubmiſſive. He negociated with all the courts of Europe, in
order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf friends and partizans: He even neglected not the
court of Rome and that of Spain; and tho' he engaged himſelf in no poſitive
promiſe, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the catholics with hopes, that, in caſe of his
ſucceſſion, they might expect ſome more liberty than what was at
preſent indulged them. Elizabeth was the only ſovereign in Europe to whom
he never dared to mention his right of ſucceſſion: He knew, that tho' her
great age might now invite her to think of fixing an heir to the crown, ſhe
never could bear the proſpect of her own death without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and was
determined ſtill to retain him, and all other competitors, in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
dependance upon her.</p>
               <p>ESSEX was deſcended by females from the royal family; and
ſome of his ſanguine partizans had been ſo imprudent as to mention his
name among thoſe of other pretenders to the crown; but the earl took care, by
means of Henry Lee, whom he ſecretly ſent into Scotland, to aſſure
James, that, ſo far from entertaining ſuch ambitious views, he was
determined to uſe every expedient for extorting an immediate declaration in
favour of this monarch's right of ſucceſſion. James willingly hearkened
to this propoſal; but did not approve of the violent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which Eſſex
intended to employ. Eſſex had communicated his ſcheme to Mountjoy, lord
deputy of Ireland; and as no man ever commanded more the cordial affection and
attachment of his friends, he had even engaged a perſon of that virtue and
prudence to entertain thoughts of bringing over part of his army 
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:0429000102:300"/> into England, and of forcing the Queen to declare the
King of Scots her ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs,

                  </note>. And
ſuch was Eſſex's impatient ardour, that, tho' James declined this
dangerous expedient, he ſtill endeavoured to perſuade Mountjoy not to
deſiſt from the project: But the deputy, who thought that ſuch violence,
tho' it might be prudent, and even juſtifiable, when ſupported by a
ſovereign prince next heir to the crown, would be raſh and criminal, if
attempted by ſubjects, entirely refuſed his concurrence. The
correſpondence, however, between Eſſex and the court of Scotland was
ſtill conducted with great ſecrecy and cordiality; and that nobleman,
beſides conciliating the favour of James, repreſented all his own
adverſaries as enemies to that prince's ſucceſſion, and as men entirely
devoted to the intereſts of Spain, and partizans of the chimerical title of
the Infanta.</p>

ſoon broke off, on account of a diſpute of ceremony. Among the European
ſtates England had ever been allowed the precedency above Caſtile, Arragon,
Portugal, and the other kingdoms of which the Spaniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was

in power, could not compare with it in point of antiquity, the only durable and

Eſſex, not contented with theſe arts for decrying his adverſaries,
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to concert more violent methods of ruining them; chiefly
inſtigated by Cuffe, his ſecretary, a man of a bold and arrogant ſpirit,
who had acquired a great aſcendant over his patron. A ſelect council of
malecontents was formed, who commonly met at Drury-houſe, and were compoſed
of Sir Charles Davers, to whom the houſe belonged, the earl of Southampton,
Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Sir Chriſtopher Blount, Sir John Davis, and John
Littleton; and Eſſex, who boaſted, that he had an hundred and twenty
barons, knights, and gentlemen of note, at his devotion, and who truſted
ſtill more to his authority with the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, communicated to his
aſſociates thoſe ſecret deſigns and reſolutions, with which his
confidence in ſo powerful a party had inſpired him. Among other criminal
projects, the reſult of blind rage and deſpair, he deliberated with them
concerning the method of taking arms; and aſked their opinion, whether he had
beſt begin with ſeizing the palace or the Tower, or ſet out with making
himſelf maſter at once of both places. The firſt enterprize being
preferred, a method was concerted for executing it. 
<note place="margin">His inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> It was agreed,

               <p>WHILE theſe deſperate projects were in agitation, many
reaſons of ſuſpicion were carried to the Queen; and ſhe ſent Robert
Sacville, the treaſurer's ſon, to Eſſex-houſe, under pretence of a
viſit, but, in reality, with a view of diſcovering whether there was in
that place any concourſe of people, or any extraordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, which
might threaten an inſurrection. Soon after, Eſſex received a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to attend the council, which met at the treaſurer's houſe; and while he was
muſing on this circumſtance, and comparing it with the late unexpected
viſit from Sacville, a private note was conveyed to him, by which he was
warned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his own ſafety. He concluded, that all his
conſpiracy was diſcovered, or at leaſt ſuſpected, and that the
eaſieſt puniſhment which he could expect, was a new and more ſevere
conſinement: He therefore excuſed himſelf to the council on pretence of
an indiſpoſition; and he immediately diſpatched meſſages to his more
intimate confederates, requeſting their advice and aſſiſtance in the
preſent cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <pb n="697" facs="tcp:0429000102:302"/> ſituation of his affairs. They
deliberated, whether they ſhould abandon all their projects, and fly the
kingdom; or inſtantly ſeize the palace with the force which they could
aſſemble; or rely upon the affections of the citizens, who were generally
known to bear a great affection to the earl. Eſſex declared againſt the
firſt expedient, and profeſſed himſelf determined to undergo any fate
rather than ſubmit to live the life of a fugitive. To ſeize the palace
ſeemed impracticable without more preparation; eſpecially as the Queen
ſeemed now aware of their projects, and, as they heard, had uſed the
precaution of doubling her ordinary guards. There remained, therefore, no other
expedient but that of betaking themſelves to the city; and while the prudence
and expediency of this reſolution was under debate, a perſon arrived, who,
as if he had received a commiſſion for that purpoſe, gave them
aſſurance of the good affection of the Londoners, and affirmed, that they
might ſecurely reſt any project on that foundation. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity of
Eſſex had chiefly buoyed him up in all his vain undertakings; and he fondly
imagined, that with no other aſſiſtance than the good will of the
multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he might be enabled to overturn Elizabeth's government, confirmed
by time, revered for wiſdom, ſupported by vigour, and concurring with the
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſentiments of the nation. The wild project of raiſing the city was
immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reſolved on; the execution of it was delayed till next day; and
emiſſaries were diſpatched to all Eſſex's friends, informing them
that Cobham and Raleigh had laid ſchemes againſt his life, and entreating
their preſence and aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>

To others, he boaſted of his intereſt in the city, and affirmed, that,

former project. He iſſued out with about two hundred attendants, armed only
with ſwords; and in his paſſage to the city was joined by the earl of
Bedford and lord Cromwel. He cried aloud, <hi>For the Queen! for the Queen! a
plot is laid for my life;</hi> and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the houſe of Smith, the
ſheriff, on whoſe aid he had great reliance. The citizens flocked about him
in amazement; but tho' he told them, that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was ſold to the infanta,
and exhorted them to arm inſtantly, otherwiſe they could not do him any
ſervice, no one ſhowed a diſpoſition to join him. The ſheriff, on the
earl's approach to his houſe, ſtole out at the back door, and made the
beſt of his way to the lord mayor. Eſſex, meanwhile, obſerving the
coldneſs of the citizens, and hearing, that he was proclaimed a traitor by
the earl of Cumberland and lord Burleigh, began to deſpair of ſucceſs,
and thought of retreating to his own houſe. He found the ſtreets in his
paſſage barricadoed, and guarded by the citizens, under the command of Sir
John Leviſon. In his attempt to force his way, Tracy, a young gentleman, to
whom he bore great friendſhip, was killed, with two or three of the
Londoners; and the earl him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, attended by a few of his partizans (for the

river, and taking boat, arrived at Eſſex-houſe. He there found, that
Gorges, whom he had ſent before to capitulate with the lord keeper and the

proſecution of lord Sandys's advice, to defend himſelf to the laſt
extremity, and rather to periſh, like a brave man, with his ſword in his
hand, than baſely by the hands of the executioner: But after ſome parley,

               <p>THE Queen, who, during all this commotion, had behaved with as
great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and ſecurity, as if there had only paſſed a fray in
the ſtreets, in which ſhe was no way concerned<note n="†" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 469.</note>, ſoon gave orders for
the trial of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the criminals. 
<note place="margin">19th February.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">His trial.</note> The earls of Eſſex and
Southampton were arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a jury of twenty-five peers, where
Buckhurſt acted as lord ſteward. The guilt of the priſoners was too
apparent to admit of any doubt; and, beſides the inſurrection known to
every body, the treaſonable conferences at Drury-houſe were proved by
undoubted evidence. Sir Ferdinando Gorges was produced in court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
confeſſions of the earl of Rutland, of the lords Cromwel, Sandys, and
Monteagle, of Davers, Blount, and Davies, were only read to the peers,
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <pb n="699" facs="tcp:0429000102:304"/> to the practice of that age. Eſſex's
beſt friends were ſcandalized at his aſſurance in inſiſting ſo
poſitively on his innocence, and the goodneſs of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; and
ſtill more at his vindictive diſpoſition, in accuſing, without any
appearance of reaſon, ſecretary Cecil as a partizan of the infanta's title.
The ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, who had expected this charge, ſtepped into the court, and
challenged Eſſex to produce his authority, which, on examination, was found
extremely weak and frivolous<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bacon, vol. IV. p.
530.</note>. When ſentence was pronounced, Eſſex ſpoke like a man who
laid his account to die: But he added, that he ſhould be ſorry, if he was
repreſented to the Queen as a perſon that deſpiſed her clemency; tho'
he ſhould not, he believed, make any cringing ſubmiſſions to obtain it.
Southampton's behaviour was more mild and ſubmiſſive: He entreated the
good offices of the peers in ſo modeſt and becoming a manner, as excited
compaſſion in every one.</p>
               <p>THE moſt remarkable circumſtance in Eſſex's trial was
Bacon's appearance againſt him. He was none of the crown lawyers; ſo was
not obliged by his office to aſſiſt at this trial: Yet did he not
ſcruple, in order to obtain the Queen's favour, to be active in bereaving of
life his friend and patron, whoſe generoſity he had often experienced. He
compared Eſſex's conduct, in pretending to fear the attempts of his
adverſaries, to that of Piſiſtratus, the Athenian, who cut and wounded
his own body; and making the people believe, that his enemies had committed
that violence, obtained a guard for his perſon, by whoſe aſſiſtance
he afterwards ſubdued the liberties of his country.</p>
               <p>AFTER Eſſex had paſſed ſome days in the folitude and
reflection of a priſon, his proud heart was at laſt ſubdued, not by the
fear of death, but by the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of religion; a principle, which he had
before attempted to make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his ambition, but which now took
a more firm hold of his mind, and prevailed over every other motive and
conſideration. His ſpiritual directors perſuaded him, that he never could
obtain the pardon of heaven, unleſs he made a full confeſſion of his
diſloyalty; and he gave in to the council an account of all his moſt
criminal deſigns, as well as of his correſpondence with the King of Scots.
He ſpared not even his moſt intimate friends, ſuch as lord Mountjoy, whom
he had engaged in theſe conſpiracies; and he

particular, a man of merit, he accuſed of a correſpondence with the
conſpirators; tho' it appears, that that gentleman had never aſſented to
the propoſals made him, and was no farther <pb n="700" facs="tcp:0429000102:305"/> criminal
than in not revealing the earl's treaſon; an office, to which every man of
honour naturally bears the ſtrongeſt reluctance<note n="†" place="bottom">Winwood, vol. I. p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>2.</note>. Neville was thrown into priſon, and underwent a
ſevere perſecution: But as the Queen found Mountjoy a very able and
ſucceſsful commander, ſhe continued him in his government, and
ſacrificed her reſentment to the public ſervice.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH affected extremely the praiſe of clemency; and in
every great example, which ſhe had made during her reign, ſhe had always
appeared full of reluctance and heſitation: But the preſent ſituation of
Eſſex called forth all her tender affections, and kept her in the moſt
real agitation and irreſolution. She felt a perpetual combat between
reſentment and inclination, pride and compaſſion, the care of her own
ſafety and concern for her favourite; and her ſituation, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this
interval, was perhaps more an object of pity, than that to which Eſſex
himſelf was reduced. She ſigned the warrant for his execution; ſhe
counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it; ſhe again reſolved on his death; ſhe felt a new return
of tenderneſs: Eſſex's enemies told her, that he himſelf deſired to
die, and had aſſured her, that ſhe could never be in ſafety while he
lived: It is likely, that this proof of penitence and of concern for her, would
operate a contrary effect to what they intended, and would revive all that fond
affection, which ſhe had ſo long indulged to the unhappy priſoner. But
what chiefly hardened her heart againſt him was his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
obſtinacy, in never making, as ſhe hourly expected, any application to her
for mercy and forgiveneſs; and ſhe finally gave her conſent to his
execution. He diſcovered at his death ſymptoms rather of penitence and
piety than of fear; and willingly acknowleged the juſtice of the ſentence,
by which he ſuffered.

doubt, thought, that prudence required the removal of ſo melancholy a
ſpectacle from the public eye. Sir Walter Raleigh, who came to the Tower on
purpoſe, and who beheld Eſſex's execution from a window, encreaſed much
by this action the general hatred, under which he already laboured: It was
thought, that he had no other purpoſe than to feaſt his eyes with the death
of his enemy; and no apology, which he could make for ſo exceptionable a
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of conduct, could be accepted by the public. The cruelty and
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, <pb n="701" facs="tcp:0429000102:306"/> with which he urged on Eſſex's fate,
even when Cecil relented<note n="‡" place="bottom">Murdin, p 811.</note>,
were ſtill regarded as the principles of this unmanly and ungenerous
behaviour.</p>
               <p>THE earl of Eſſex was but thirty-four years of age, when his
raſhneſs, impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and violence brought him to this untimely end. We
muſt here, as in many other inſtances, lament the inconſtancy of human
nature, that a perſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſo many noble virtues, generoſity,
ſincerity, friendſhip, valour, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and induſtry, ſhould in the
latter period of his life have given ſuch reins to his ungovernable
paſſions, as involved, not only himſelf, but many of his friends, in
utter ruin. The Queen's tenderneſs and paſſion, as it was the cauſe of
thoſe premature honours, which he attained, ſeems, on the whole, the chief
circumſtance which brought on his deſtruction. Confident of her partiality
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; as well as of his own merit, he treated her with a haughtineſs,
which neither her love nor her dignity could bear; and as her amorous
inclinations in ſo advanced an age, would naturally make her appear
ridiculous, if not hateful in his eyes, he was engaged, by an imprudent
openneſs, of which he made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to diſcover too eaſily
thoſe ſentiments to her jealous pride. The many reconciliations and returns
of affection, of which he had ſtill made advantage, made him venture on new
provocations, till he puſhed her beyond all bounds of patience; and he
forgot, that, tho' the ſentiments of the woman were ever ſtrong in her,
thoſe of the ſovereign had ſtill in the end appeared predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>SOME of Eſſex's aſſociates, Cuffe, Davers, Blount,
Meric, and Davis were tried and condemned, and all of them, except Davis, were
executed. The Queen pardoned the reſt; being perſuaded that they were drawn
in merely from their friendſhip to that nobleman, and their care of his
ſafety; and were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the more criminal part of his intentions.
Southampton's life was ſpared with great difficulty; but he was kept in
priſon during all the remainder of this reign.</p>
               <p>THE King of Scots, who was apprehenſive left his
correſpondence with Eſſex might have been diſcovered, and have given
offence to Elizabeth, ſent the earl of Mar and the lord Kinloſs as
ambaſſadors to England, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate the Queen on her eſcape
from the late inſurrection and conſpiracy. They were alſo ordered to
enquire whether any meaſures had been taken by her to exclude him from the
ſucceſſion, as well as to diſcover the inclinations of the chief
nobility and counſellors, in caſe of the Queen's demiſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

II<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 510.</note>. They found the diſpoſitions of men as favourable
as they could wiſh; and they even entered into <pb n="702" facs="tcp:0429000102:307"/> a
correſpondence with ſecretary Cecil, whoſe influence, after the fall of
Eſſex, was now uncontrouled<note n="†" place="bottom">Oſborne, p.
615.</note>, and who was reſolved, by this policy, to acquire, in time, the
confidence of the ſucceſſor. He knew how jealous Elizabeth ever was of
her authority, and he therefore carefully concealed from her his attachment to
James: But he afterwards aſſerted, that nothing could be more advantageous
to her, than this correſpondence; becauſe the King of Scots, ſecure of
mounting the throne by his undoubted title, aided by thoſe connexions with
the Engliſh miniſtry, was the leſs likely to give any diſturbance to
the preſent ſovereign. He alſo perſuaded that prince to remain in
quiet, and patiently to expect, that time ſhould open to him the inheritance
of the throne, without puſhing his friends on deſperate enterprizes, which
would totally incapacitate them from ſerving him. James's equity, as well as
his natural want of enterprize, eaſily inclined him to embrace this
reſolution<note n="‡" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 471, 472.</note>;
and thus the minds of the Engliſh were ſilently, but univerſally
diſpoſed to admit, without oppoſition, the ſucceſſion of the
Scottiſh line: The death of Eſſex, by putting an end to faction, had been
rather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable than prejudicial to that great event.</p>
               <p>THE King of France, who was little prepoſſeſſed in
favour of James, and who was averſe to the union of England and Scotland<note n="*" place="bottom">Winwood, vol. I. p. 352.</note>, made his ambaſſador
drop ſome hints to Cecil of Henry's willingneſs to concur in any meaſure
for diſappointing the hopes of the Scotch monarch; but as Cecil ſhowed an
entire diſapprobation of ſuch ſchemes, the court of France took no
farther ſteps in that matter: and thus the only foreign power, which could
give much diſturbance to James's ſucceſſion, was induced to acquieſce
in it<note n="‖" place="bottom">Spotſwood, p. 471.</note>. 
<note place="margin">French affairs.</note> Henry made a journey
this ſummer to Calais; and the Queen, hearing of his intentions, went to
Dover, in hopes of having a perſonal interview with a monarch, whom, of all
others, ſhe moſt loved and moſt reſpected. The French King, who felt
the ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards her, would gladly have accepted of the
propoſal; but as many difficulties occurred, it appeared neceſſary to lay
aſide, by common conſent, the project of an interview. Elizabeth, however,
wrote ſucceſſively two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Henry, one by Edmondes, another by Sir
Robert Sydney, in which ſhe expreſſed a deſire of conferring about a
buſineſs of importance, with ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in whom that prince
repoſed entire confidence. The marqueſs of Rhoni, the King's favourite and
prime miniſter, came to Dover in diſguiſe; and the memoirs of that able
ſtateſman contain a full account of his converſation with Elizabeth. That
magnanimous princeſs had formed a ſcheme of eſtabliſhing, in
conjunction with Henry, a new ſyſtem of policy in Europe, and of fixing a 
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:0429000102:308"/> durable ballance of power, by the erection of new
ſtates on the ruins of the houſe of Auſtria. She had even the wiſdom to
foreſee the perils, which might enſue from the aggrandizement of her ally;
and ſhe propoſed to unite the whole ſeventeen provinces of the Low
Countries into one republic, in order to form a perpetual barrier againſt the
dangerous encreaſe of the French, as well as of the Spaniſh, monarchy.
Henry had himſelf long meditated ſuch a project againſt the Auſtrian
family; and Rhoni could not forbear expreſſing his aſtoniſhment, when
he found that Elizabeth and his maſter, tho' they had never communicated
their thoughts on this ſubject, had not only entered into the ſame general
views, but had alſo formed the ſame project for their execution. The
affairs, however, of France were not yet brought to a ſituation, which might
enable Henry to begin that great enterprize; and Rhoni ſatisfied the Queen,
that it would be neceſſary to poſtpone for ſome years their united
attack on the Auſtrian family. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, filled with juſt admiration of
the ſolidity of Elizabeth's judgment, and the greatneſs of her mind; and he
owns that ſhe was entirely worthy of that high reputation, which ſhe
poſſeſſed in Europe.</p>
               <p>THE Queen's magnanimity in forming ſuch extenſive projects
was the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that, beſides her having fallen ſo far into the
decline of life, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Ireland, tho' conducted with ability and
ſucceſs, were ſtill in diſorder, and made a great diverſion of her
forces. The expence incurred by this war lay heavy upon her narrow revenues;
and her miniſters, taking advantage of her great diſpoſition to
frugality, propoſed to her an expedient of ſaving, which, tho' ſhe at
firſt diſapproved of it, ſhe was at laſt induced to embrace. It was
repreſented to her, that the great ſums of money remitted to Ireland for
the pay of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh forces, came, by the neceſſary courſe of
circulation, into the hands of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and enabled them to buy abroad all
requiſite ſupplies of arms and ammunition, which, from the extreme poverty
of that kingdom and its want of every uſeful commodity, they could not
otherwiſe find means to purchaſe. It was therefore propoſed to her, that
ſhe ſhould pay her forces in money of a baſe alloy; and it was
aſſerted, that, beſides the great ſaving to the revenue, this ſpecies
of coin could never be exported with advantage, and would not paſs in any
foreign market. Some of the wiſer counſellors maintained, that, if the pay
of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers was raiſed in proportion, the Iriſh rebels would
neceſſarily reap the ſame benefit from the baſe money, which would
always be taken at a rate ſuitable to its value; if the pay was not raiſed,
there was danger of a mutiny among the troops, who, whatever names might be
affixed to the pieces of metal, would ſoon find from experience that they
were defrauded in their income<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p.

MOUNTJOY, the deputy, was a man of great ability; and foreſeeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of mutiny among the troops, he led them inſtantly into the field, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, by means of ſtrict diſcipline, and by keeping them employed
againſt the enemy, to obviate thoſe inconveniencies, which were juſtly
apprehended. He made military roads, and built a fortreſs at Moghery; he
drove the Mac-Geniſes out of Lecale; he harraſſed Tyrone in Ulſter with
inroads and leſſer expeditions; and by deſtroying, every where, and
during all ſeaſons, the proviſions of the Iriſh, he reduced them to
periſh with famine in the woods and moraſſes, to which they were obliged
to retreat. At the ſame time, Sir Henry Docwray, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded another body
of troops, took the caſtle of Derry, and put garriſons into Newton and
Ainogh; and having ſeized the monaſtery of Donnegal near Baliſhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, he
threw troops into it, and defended it againſt the aſſaults of O'Donnel
and the Iriſh. Nor was Sir George Carew idle in the province of Munſter. He
ſeized the titular earl of Deſmond, and ſent him over, with Florence
Macarty, another chieftain, priſoner to England. He arreſted many
ſuſpected perſons, and took hoſtages from others. And having got a
reinforcement of two thouſand men from England, he threw himſelf into
Corke, which he ſupplied with arms and proviſions; and he put every thing
in a condition for reſiſting the Spaniſh invaſion, which was daily
expected. The deputy, informed of the danger, to which the ſouthern provinces
were expoſed, left the proſecution of the war againſt Tyrone, who was
reduced to great extremity; and he marched with his army into Monſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">23d Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> AT laſt, the
Spaniards, under Don John d'Aquila, arrived at Kingſale; and Sir Richard
Piercy, who commanded in the town with a ſmall garriſon of an hundred and
fifty men, ſound himſelf obliged to abandon it on their appearance. Theſe
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders amounted to four thouſand men, and the Iriſh expreſſed a
great deſire to join them, in order to free themſelves from the Engliſh
government, with which they were extremely diſcontented. One chief ground of
their complaint was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of trials by jury<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 644.</note>; an inſtitution, abhorred by
this barbarous nation, tho' nothing contributes more to the ſupport of that
equity and liberty, for which the Engliſh laws are ſo juſtly celebrated.
The Iriſh alſo bore a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <pb n="705" facs="tcp:0429000102:310"/> to the
Spaniards, having entertained the opinion, that they themſelves were
deſcended from that nation; and their attachment to the catholic religion
proved a new cauſe of affection to the invaders. D'Aquila aſſumed the
title of general in the holy war for the preſervation of the faith in
Ireland; and he endeavoured to perſuade the people, that Queen Elizabeth was,
by ſeveral bulls of the pope, deprived of her crown; that her ſubjects were
abſolved from their oaths of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; and that the Spaniards were come to
deliver the Iriſh from the power of the devil<note n="*" place="bottom">

Mountjoy found it neceſſary to act with vigour, in order to prevent a total
inſurrection of the Iriſh; and having gathered together his forces, he
formed the ſiege of Kinſale by land; while Sir Richard Leviſon, with a
ſmall ſquadron, blockaded it by ſea. He had no ſooner begun his
operations than he heard of the arrival of another body of two thouſand
Spaniards, under the command of Alphonſo Ocampo, who had taken
poſſeſſion of Baltimore and Bere-haven; and he found himſelf obliged
to detach Sir George Carew to oppoſe their progreſs. Tyrone, meanwhile,
with Randal, Mac Surley, Tirel baron of Killey, and other chieftains of the
Iriſh, had joined Ocampo with all their forces, and were marching to the
relief of Kinſale. The deputy, informed of their deſign by intercepted
letters, made preparations to receive them; and being joined by Leviſon with
ſix hundred marines, he poſted his troops on an advantageous ground, which
lay on their paſſage, leaving ſome cavalry to prevent a ſally from
D'Aquila and the Spaniſh garriſon. When Tyrone, with a body of Iriſh and
Spaniards, approached, he was ſurprized to find the Engliſh ſo well
poſted, and ranged in ſuch good order; and he immediately ſounded a
retreat: But the deputy gave orders to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him; and having thrown theſe
advanced troops into diſorder, he followed them to the main body, whom he
alſo attacked, and put to flight, with the ſlaughter of twelve hundred
men<note n="†" place="bottom">Winwood, vol I p 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ulſter; Odonel made his eſcape into Spain; and D'Aquila, finding himſelf
reduced to the greateſt difficulties, was obliged to capitulate upon ſuch
terms as the deputy preſcribed to him: He ſurrendered Kinſale and
Baltimore, and agreed to evacuate the Kingdom. This great blow, joined to other
ſucceſſes, gained by Wilmot, governor of Kerry, and by Roger and Gavin
Harvey, threw the rebels into diſmay, and gave a proſpect of the final
reduction of that kingdom.</p>
               <p>THE Iriſh war, tho' ſucceſsful, was extremely
burthenſome on the Queen's revenue; and beſides the ſupplies granted by

her popularity by the unfortunate execution of Eſſex, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that,
when ſhe appeared in public, ſhe was not attended with the uſual
acclamations<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 602. Oſborne, p.
604.</note>, yet the powers of her prerogative, ſupported by her vigour,
ſtill remained as high and uncontroulable as ever.</p>
               <p>THE active reign of Elizabeth had enabled many perſons to
diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in civil and military employments; and the Queen,
who was not able, from her revenue, to give them any rewards proportioned to
their ſervice, had made uſe of an expedient, which had been employed by her
predeceſſors, but which had never been carried to ſuch an extreme as
under her adminiſtration. She granted her ſervants and courtiers patents
for monopolies; and theſe patents they ſold to others, who were thereby
enabled to raiſe commodities to what price they pleaſed, and who put
invincible reſtraints upon all commerce, induſtry, and emulation. It is
aſtoniſhing to conſider the number and importance of thoſe commodities,
which were thus aſſigned over to patentees. Currants, ſalt, iron, powder,
cards, calf-ſkins, fells, pouldavies, ox-ſhin-bones, train oil, liſts of
cloth, pot-aſhes, anniſeeds, vinegar, ſea-coals, ſteel, aquavitae,
bruſhes, pots, bottles, ſalt-petre, lead, accidences, oil,
calamint-ſtone, oil of blubber, glaſſes, paper, ſtarch, tin, ſulphur,
new drapery, dried pilchers, tranſportation of iron ordnance, of beer, of
horn, of leather, importation of Spaniſh wools, of iriſh yarn: Theſe are
but a part of the commodities, which had been conſigned over to
monopoliſts<note n="‖" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 648, 650, 652.</note>.
When this liſt was read over in the houſe, a member cried out, <hi>Is not
bread in the number? Bread,</hi> ſaid every one with aſtoniſhment:
<hi>Yes, I aſſure you,</hi> replied he, <hi>if affairs go on at this rate,
we ſhall have bread reduced to a monopoly before next Parliament</hi>
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 648.</note>. Theſe monopoliſts were ſo
exorbitant in their demands, that in ſome places they raiſed the price of
ſalt, from ſixteen pence a buſhel, to fourteen or fifteen
ſhillings<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 647.</note>. Such high
profits naturally begot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders upon their commerce; and in order to
ſecure themſelves againſt encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the patentees were armed with
high and arbitrary powers from the council, by which they were enabled to
oppreſs the people at pleaſure, and to exact money from ſuch as they
thought proper to accuſe of interfering with their patent<note n="¶" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 641, 646, 652.</note>. The patentees of ſalt-petre,
having the power of entering into every <pb n="707" facs="tcp:0429000102:312"/> houſe, and of
committing what havock they pleaſed in ſtables, cellars, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they
ſuſpected ſalt-petre might be gathered; commonly extorted money from
thoſe who deſired to free themſelves of this damage or trouble<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 653.</note>. And while all domeſtic intercourſe was
thus reſtrained, leſt any ſcope ſhould remain for induſtry, almoſt
every ſpecies of foreign commerce was confined to excluſive companies, who
bought and ſold at any price, that they themſelves thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to offer
or exact.</p>
               <p>THESE grievances, the moſt intolerable for the preſent, and
the moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in their conſequences, that ever were known in any age
or under any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, had been mentioned in the laſt Parliament, and a
petition had even been preſented to the Queen, complaining of the patents;
but ſhe ſtill perſiſted in defending her monopoliſts againſt her
people. A bill was now introduced into the lower houſe, aboliſhing all
theſe monopolies; and as the former application had been unſucceſsful, a
law was inſiſted on as the only certain expedient for correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe
abuſes: The courtiers, on the other hand, maintained, that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
regarded the prerogative, and that they could never hope for ſucceſs, if
they did not make application, in the moſt humble and reſpectful manner, to
the Queen's goodneſs and beneficence. The topics, which were advanced in the
houſe, and which came equally from the courtiers and the country gentlemen,
and were admitted by both, will appear the moſt extraordinary to ſuch as
are prepoſſeſſed with an idea of the antient privileges of the people,
and of the liberty enjoyed under the adminiſtration of Elizabeth. It was
aſſerted, that the Queen poſſeſſed both an enlarging and a
reſtraining power; by her prerogative ſhe might ſet at liberty what was
reſtrained by ſtatute or otherwiſe, and by her prerogative ſhe might
reſtrain what was otherwiſe at liberty<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.

divan than of an Engliſh houſe of commons, according to our preſent idea
of this aſſembly, the Queen, who perceived how odious monopolies had
become, and what heats were likely to riſe, ſent for the ſpeaker, and
deſired him to inform <pb n="708" facs="tcp:0429000102:313"/> the houſe, that ſhe would
immediately cancel the moſt grievous and oppreſſive of theſe
patents<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>It may not be amiſs to ſubjoin ſome paſſages of
theſe ſpeeches; which may ſerve very much to give us a juſt idea of the
antient conſtitution, and of the political principles, which prevailed during
the reign of Elizabeth. Mr. Laurence Hyde propoſed a bill, entitled an act
for the explanation of the common law in certain caſes of letters patent. Mr.
Spicer ſaid, This bill may touch the prerogative-royal, which, as I learned
the laſt Parliament, is ſo tranſcendant, that the — of the
ſubject may not aſpire thereunto. Far be it therefore from me, that the
ſtate and prerogative-royal of the prince ſhould be tied by me or by the
act of any other ſubject. Mr. Francis Bacon ſaid, As to the
preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-royal of the prince, for my own part, I ever allowed of it; and it
is ſuch as I hope will never be diſcuſſed. The Queen, as ſhe is our
ſovereign, hath both an enlarging and reſtraining power. For by her
prerogative ſhe may ſet at liberty things reſtrained by ſtatute law or
otherwiſe, and ſecondly by her prerogative ſhe may reſtrain things
which be at liberty. For the firſt, ſhe may grant a <hi>non obſtante</hi>
contrary to the penal laws.—With regard to monopolies and ſuch like
caſes, the caſe hath ever been to humble ourſelves unto her majeſty,
and by petition deſire to have our grievances remedied, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when
the remedy toucheth her ſo nigh in point of prerogative.—I ſay, and I
ſay it again, that we ought not to deal, to judge or meddle with her
majeſty's prerogative. I wiſh therefore every man to be careful of this
buſineſs. Dr. Bennet ſaid, He that goeth about to debate her majeſty's
prerogative had need to walk warily. Mr. Laurence Hyde ſaid, For the bill
itſelf, I made it, and I think I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it: And far be it from this
heart of mine to think, this tongue to ſpeak, or this hand to write any thing
either in prejudice or derogation of her majeſty's prerogative-royal and the
ſtate.—Mr. Speaker, quoth ſerjeant Harris, for ought I ſee, the
houſe moveth to have this bill in the nature of a petition. It muſt then
begin with more humiliation. And truly, Sir, the bill is good of itſelf, but
the penning of it is ſomewhat out of courſe. Mr. Montague ſaid, The
matter is good and honeſt, and I like this manner of proceeding by bill well
enough in this matter. The grievances are great, and I would note only unto you
thus much, that the laſt Parliament we proceeded by way of petition, which
had no ſucceſsful effect. Mr. Francis More ſaid, I know the Queen's
prerogative is a thing curious to be dealt withal; yet all grievances are not
comparable. I cannot utter with my tongue or conceive with my heart the great
grievances that the town and country, for which I ſerve, ſuffereth by
ſome of theſe monopolies. It bringeth the general profit into a private
hand, and the end of all this is beggary and bondage to the ſubjects. We have
a law for the true and faithful currying of leather: There is a patent ſets
all at liberty, notwithſtanding that ſtatute. And to what purpoſe is it
to do any thing by act of Parliament, when the Queen will undo the ſame by
her prerogative? Out of the ſpirit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, Mr. Speaker, I do ſpeak
it, there is no act of her's that hath been or is more derogatory to her own
majeſty, more odious to the ſubject, more dangerous to the commonwealth
than the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe monopolies. Mr. Martin ſaid, I do ſpeak for a
town that grieves and pines, for a country that groaneth and languiſheth
under the burthen of monſtrous and unconſcionable ſubſtitutes to the
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitans of ſtarch, tin, fiſh, cloth, oil, vinegar, ſalt and I know
not what; nay, what not? The principaleſt commodities both of my town and
country are engroſt into the hands of theſe blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers of the
commonwealth. If a body, Mr. Speaker, being let blood, be left ſtill
languiſhing without any remedy, how can the good eſtate of that body
ſtill remain? Such is the ſtate of my town and country; the traffic is
taken away, the inward and private commodities are taken away, and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e not be uſed without the licence of
theſe monopolitans. If theſe blood ſuckers be ſtill let alone to ſuck
up the beſt and principalleſt commodities, which the earth there hath given
us, what will become of us, from whom the fruits of our own ſoil and the
commodities of our own labour, which with the ſweat of our brows, even up to
the knees in mire and dirt, we have laboured for, ſhall be taken by warrant
of ſupreme authority, which the poor ſubject dare not gainſay? Mr. George
Moore ſaid, We know the power of her majeſty cannot be reſtrained by any
act; why therefore ſhould we thus talk? Admit we ſhould make this ſtatute
with a <hi>non obſtante;</hi> yet the Queen may grant a patent with a <hi>non
obſtante,</hi> to croſs this <hi>non obſtante.</hi> I think therefore it
agreeth more with the gravity and wiſdom of this houſe to proceed with all
humbleneſs by petition than bill. Mr. Downland ſaid, As I would be no let
or over-vehement in any thing, ſo I am not ſottiſh or ſenſeleſs of
the common grievance of the commonwealth. If we proceed by way of petition, we
can have no more gracious anſwer, than we had the laſt Parliament to our
petition. But ſince that Parliament, we have no reformation. Sir Robert Wroth
ſaid, I ſpeak, and I ſpeak it boldly, theſe patentees are worſe than
ever they were. Mr. Hayward Townſend propoſed, that they ſhould make
ſuit to her majeſty, not only to repeal all monopolies grievous to the
ſubject, but alſo that it would pleaſe her majeſty to give the
Parliament leave to make an act, that they might be of no more force, validity,
or effect, than they are at the common law, without the ſtrength of her
prerogative. Which tho' we might now do, and the act being ſo reaſonable,
we might aſſure ourſelves her majeſty would not delay the paſſing
thereof, yet we, her loving ſubjects, &amp;c. would not offer without her
privity and conſent (the cauſe ſo nearly touching her prerogative) or go
about to do any ſuch act.</p> 
                     <p>On a ſubſequent day, the bill againſt monopolies was
again introduced, and Mr. Spicer ſaid, It is to no purpoſe to offer to tie
her majeſty's hands by act of parliament, when ſhe may looſen herſelf
at her pleaſure. Mr. Davies ſaid, God hath given that power to abſolute
princes, which he attributes to himſelf. <hi>Dixi quod Dii eſtis.</hi> (N.
B. This axiom he applies to the Kings of England.) Mr. ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Cecil
ſaid, I am ſervant to the Queen, and before I would ſpeak and give
conſent to a caſe that ſhould debaſe her prerogative, or abridge it, I
would wiſh that my tongue were cut out of my head. I am ſure there were
law-makers before there were laws: (Meaning, I ſuppoſe, that the
ſovereign wa above the laws.) One gentleman went about to poſters us, with
the execution of the law man ancient record of 5 or 7 of Edward the third.
Likely enough to be true in that time, when the King was afraid of the
ſubject. If you ſtand upon law, and diſpute of the prerogative, he

been moved extravagantly in the houſe, which doubtleſs have been told her
majeſty, and perhaps ill conceived of by her, Mr. Speaker would apologize,
and humbly crave pardon for the ſame. N. B. Theſe extracts were taken by
Townſend, a member of the houſe, who was no courtier; and the extravagance
of the ſpeeches ſeems rather to be on the other ſide: It will certainly
appear odd to us, that this liberty ſhould be thought extravagant However,
the Queen, notwithſtanding her cajoling the houſe, was ſo ill ſatisfied
with theſe proceedings, that ſhe ſpoke of them peeviſhly in her
concluding ſpeech, and told them, that ſhe perceived, that private
reſpects with them were privately maſqued under public preſence. D'Ewes,
p. 619.</p> 
                     <p>There were ſome other topics, in favour of prerogative,
ſtill more extravagant, advanced in the houſe this Parliament. When the
queſtion of the ſubſidy was before them, Mr. ſerjeant Heyle ſaid, Mr.
Speaker, I marvel much, that the houſe ſhould ſtand upon granting of a
ſubſidy or the time of payment, when all we have is her majeſty's, and
ſhe may lawfully at her pleaſure take it from us: Yea, ſhe hath as much
right to all our lands and goods as to any revenue of her crown. At which all
the houſe hemmed, and laughed, and talked. Well, quoth ſerjeant Heyle, all
your hemming ſhall not put me out of countenance. So, Mr. Speaker ſtood up
and ſaid, It is a great diſorder, that this ſhould be uſed.—So
the ſaid ſerjeant proceeded, and when he had ſpoken a little while, the
houſe hemmed again; and ſo he fat down. In his latter ſpeech, he ſaid,
he could prove his former poſition by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents in the time of Henry the
third, King John, King Stephen, &amp;c. which was the occaſion of their
hemming. D'Ewes, p. 633. It is obſervable, that Heyle was an eminent lawyer,
a man of character. Winwood, vol. I. p. 290. And tho' the houſe in general
ſhewed their diſapprobation, no one cared to take him down, or oppoſe
theſe extravagant poſitions. It was alſo aſſerted this ſeſſion,
that in the ſame manner as the Roman conſul was poſſeſſed of the
power of rejecting or admitting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſenate, the Speaker might
either admit or reject bills in the houſe. D'Ewes, p. 677. The houſe
declared themſelves againſt this opinion; but the very propoſal of it is
a proof at what a low ebb liberty was at that time in England.</p> 
                     <p>In the year 1591, the judges made a ſolemn decree, that
England was an abſolute empire, of which the King was the head. In
conſequence of this opinion, they determined, that even if the act of the
firſt of Elizabeth had never been made, the King was ſupreme head of the
church; and might have erected, by his prerogative, ſuch a court as the
eccleſiaſtical commiſſion: For that he was the head of all his
ſubjects. Now that court was plainly arbitrary: The inference is, that his
power was equally abſolute over the laity. See Coke's Reports, p. 5.

ſhe was flattered in phraſes appropriated to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being; and ſhe
returned an anſwer, full of ſuch expreſſions of tenderneſs towards
her people, as ought to have appeared fulſome after the late inſtances of
rigour which ſhe had employed, and from which nothing but neceſſity had
made her depart. Thus was this critical affair happily terminated; and
Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, by prudently receding, in time, from her rights, maintained her
dignity, and preſerved the affections of her people.</p>
               <p>THE commons granted her a ſupply very unprecedented, of four
ſubſidies and eight fifteenths; and they were even ſo dutiful as to vote
this ſupply before they received any ſatisfaction in the buſineſs of
monopolies, which they juſtly conſidered as of the utmoſt conſequence
to the intereſt and happineſs of the nation. Had they attempted to extort
that conceſſion by keeping the ſupply in ſuſpence; ſo haughty was
the Queen's diſpoſition, this appearance of conſtraint and jealouſy had
been ſufficient to have produced a denial of all their requeſts, and to
have forced her into ſome acts of authority ſtill more violent and
arbitrary.</p>

And theſe two brave officers, that their expedition might not be entirely

harbour was guarded by a caſtle: There were eleven gallies ſtationed in it:
And the militia of the country, to the number, as was believed, of twenty
thouſand men, appeared in arms on the ſhore: Yet notwithſtanding theſe
obſtacles, and others derived from the winds and tides, the Engliſh

&amp;c.</note>: Some incidents happened which revived her tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for
Eſſex, and filled her with the deepeſt ſorrow for the conſent which
ſhe had unwarily given to his execution.</p>
               <p>THE earl of Eſſex, after his return from the fortunate
expedition againſt Cadiz, obſerving the increaſe of the Queen's fond
attachment towards him, took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to regret, that the neceſſity of
her ſervice required him often to be abſent from her perſon, and
expoſed him to all thoſe ill offices which his enemies, more aſſiduous
in their attendance, could practiſe againſt him. She was moved with this
tender jealouſy; and making him the preſent of a ring, deſired him to
keep that pledge of her affection, and aſſured him, that in whatever
diſgrace he ſhould fall, whatever prejudices ſhe might be induced to
entertain againſt him, yet, if he ſent her that ring, ſhe would
immediately, upon the ſight of it, recollect her former tenderneſs, would
afford him again a h aring, and would lend a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ear to his apology.
Eſſex, notwithſtanding all his misfortunes, reſerved this precious gift
to the laſt extremity; but after his trial and condemnation, he reſolved to
try the experiment, and he committed the ring to the counteſs of Nottingham,
whom he deſired to deliver it to the Queen. The counteſs was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on
by her huſband, who was Eſſex's capital enemy, not to execute the
commiſſion; and Elizabeth, who ſtill expected that her favourite would
make this appeal to her tenderneſs, and who aſcribed the neglect of it to
his invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible obſtinacy, was, after much delay, and many internal combats,
puſhed by reſentment and policy to ſign the warrant for his execution.
The counteſs of Nottingham, falling into ſickneſs, and ſinding
herſelf approach towards her end, was ſeized with remorſe for her
conduct; and having obtained a viſit from the Queen, ſhe craved her pardon,
and revealed to her the fatal ſecret. The Queen, aſtoniſhed with this
incident, burſt into a ſurious paſſion: She ſhook the dying
counteſs in her bed; and crying to her, <hi>That God might pardon her, but
ſhe never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

from her, and thenceforth reſigned herſelf over to the deepeſt 
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:0429000102:319"/> and moſt incurable melancholy. She rejected all
conſolation: She even refuſed food and ſuſtenance: And throwing
herſelf on the floor, ſhe kept herſelf ſilent and immoveable, feeding
her thoughts on her afflictions, and declaring life and exiſtence an
inſufferable burthen to her. Few words ſhe uttered; and they were all
expreſſive of ſome inward grief which ſhe cared not to reveal: But
ſighs and groans were the chief vent which ſhe gave to her deſpondency,
and which, tho' they diſcovered her ſorrows, were able to eaſe or abate
them. Ten days and nights ſhe lay upon the carpet, leaning on cuſhions
which her maids brought her; and her phyſicians could not perſuade her to
allow herſelf to be put to bed, much leſs to make trial of any remedies
which they preſcribed to her<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype, vol. IV. No.
276.</note>. Her anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind at laſt had ſo long preyed on her frail
body, that her end was viſibly approaching; and the council, being
aſſembled, ſent the lord keeper, the lord admiral, and the ſecretary,
to know her mind with regard to her ſucceſſor. She anſwered with a
faint voice, that as ſhe had held a regal ſcepter, ſhe deſired no other
than a royal ſucceſſor. Cecil requeſting her to explain herſelf more
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, ſhe ſubjoined, that ſhe would have a King to ſucceed
her; and who ſhould that be but her neareſt kinſman, the King of Scots.
Being then adviſed by the archbiſhop of Canterbury, to fix her thoughts
upon God, ſhe replied, that ſhe did ſo, nor did her mind in the leaſt
wander from him.

                  <note place="margin">And charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> SUCH a dark cloud
overcaſt the evening of that day, which had ſhone out with a mighty
luſtre in the eyes of all Europe. There are few great perſonages in
hiſtory who have been more expoſed to the calumny of enemies, and the
adulation of friends, than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there ſcarce is any,
whoſe reputation has been more certainly determined, by the unanimous
conſent of poſterity. The unuſual length of her adminiſtration, and the
ſtrong features of her character, were able to overcome all prejudices; and
obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her admirers
ſomewhat of their panegyrics, have at laſt, in ſpite of political
factions, and what is more, of religious animoſities, produced an uniform
judgment with regard to her conduct. Her vigour, her conſtancy, her
magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, addreſs, are allowed to merit the
high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt praiſes, and appear not to have been ſurpaſſed by any
perſon who ever filled a throne: A conduct leſs rigorous, leſs imperious,
more ſincere, more indulgent to her people, would have been requiſite to
form a perfect character. By the force of her mind, ſhe controuled all her
more active and ſtronger qualities, and <pb n="715" facs="tcp:0429000102:320"/> prevented them
from running into exceſs: Her heroiſm was exempt from all te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity, her
frugality from avarice, her friendſhip from partiality, her enterprize from
turbulency and a vain ambition: She guarded not herſelf with equal care or
equal ſucceſs from leſſer infirmities; the rivalſhip of beauty, the
deſire of admiration, the jealouſy of love, and the ſallies of anger.</p>
               <p>HER ſingular talents for government were founded equally on
her temper and on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over herſelf,
ſhe ſoon obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an uncontrouled aſcendant over her people; and while
ſhe merited all their eſteem by her real virtues, ſhe alſo engaged
their affection by her pretended ones. Few ſovereigns of England ſucceeded
to the throne in more difficult circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and none ever conducted the
government with ſuch uniform ſucceſs and felicity. Tho' unacquainted with
the practice of toleration, the true ſecret for managing religious factions,
ſhe preſerved her people, by her ſuperior prudence, from thoſe
confuſions in which theological controverſy had involved all the
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring nations: And tho' her enemies were the moſt powerful princes of
Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, the moſt active, the moſt enterprizing, the leaſt ſcrupulous,
ſhe was able by her vigour to make deep impreſſions on their ſtate: Her
own greatneſs mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while remained untouched and unimpaired.</p>
               <p>THE wiſe miniſters, and brave warriors, who flouriſhed
during her reign, ſhare the praiſe of her ſucceſs; but inſtead of
leſſening the applauſe due to her, they make great addition to it. They
owed, all of them, their advancement to her choice; they were ſupported by
her conſtancy; and with all their ability, they were never able to acquire
any undue aſcendant over her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom,
ſhe remained equally miſtreſs: The force of the tender paſſions was
great over her, but the force of her mind was ſtill ſuperior; and the
combat which her victory viſibly coſt her, ſerves only to diſplay the
firmneſs of her reſolution, and the loftineſs of her ambitious
ſentiments.</p>
               <p>THE fame of this princeſs, tho' it has ſurmounted the
prejudices both of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of bigotry, yet lies ſtill expoſed to
another prejudice, which is more durable becauſe more natural, and which,
according to the different views in which we ſurvey her, is capable either of
exalting beyond meaſure, or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the luſtre of her character.
This prejudice is founded on the conſideration of her ſex. When we
contemplate her as a woman, we are apt to be ſtruck with the higheſt
admiration of her great qualities and extenſive capacity; but we are alſo
apt to require ſome more ſoftneſs of diſpoſition, ſome greater
lenity of temper, ſome of thoſe amiable weakneſſes by which her ſex
is diſtinguiſhed. But the true method of eſtimating her merit, is to lay
aſide all theſe conſiderations, and to <pb n="716" facs="tcp:0429000102:321"/> conſider
her merely as a rational being, placed in authority, and entruſted with the
government of mankind. We may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her
as a wife or a miſtreſs; but her qualities as a ſovereign, tho' with
ſome conſiderable exceptions, are the object of undiſputed applauſe and
approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Government, manners, commerce, arts, and
learning.</note> THE party amongſt us who have diſtinguiſhed themſelves
by their adherence to liberty and a popular government, have long indulged
their prejudices againſt the ſucceeding race of princes, by beſtowing
unbounded panegyrics on the virtue and wiſdom of Elizabeth. They have even
been ſo extremely ignorant of the tranſactions of this reign, as to extol
her for a quality which, of all others, ſhe was the leaſt poſſeſt of;
a tender regard for the conſtitution, and a concern for the liberties and
privileges of her people. But as it is ſcarce poſſible for the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions of party to throw a veil much longer over facts ſo
palpable and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, there is danger leſt the public ſhould run into
the oppoſite extreme, and ſhould entertain an averſion to the memory of a
princeſs who exerciſed the royal authority in a manner ſo much contrary
to all the ideas which we at preſent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a legal conſtitution.
But Elizabeth only ſupported the prerogatives which were tranſmitted to her
by her immediate predeceſſors: She believed that her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were
entitled to no more liberty than their anceſtors enjoyed: She found that they
entirely acquieſced in her arbitrary adminiſtration: And it was not
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for her to find fault with a form of government, by which ſhe
herſelf was inveſted with ſuch unlimited authority. In the particular
exertions of power, the queſtion ought never to be forgot, <hi>What is
beſt?</hi> But in the general diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of power among the ſeveral
members of a conſtitution, there can ſeldom be admitted any other
queſtion, than <hi>What is uſual?</hi> Few examples occur of princes, who
have willingly reſigned their power: None of thoſe who have, without
ſtruggle, allowed it to be extorted from them. If any other rule than ancient
practice be followed, factions and diſſentions muſt multiply w thout end:
And tho' many conſtitutions, and none more than the Britiſh, have been
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved even by violent innovations, the praiſe which we beſtow on
thoſe patriots, to whom we are indebted for our privileges, ought to be given
with ſome reſerve, and ſurely without the leaſt rancour againſt
thoſe who adhered to the ancient conſtitution.</p>
               <p>IN order to underſtand the ancient conſtitution of England,
there is not a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod which deſerves more to be ſtudied than the reign of
Elizabeth. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives <pb n="717" facs="tcp:0429000102:322"/> of this princeſs were
ſcarce ever diſputed, and ſhe therefore employed them without ſcruple:
Her imperious temper, a circumſtance in which ſhe went far beyond her
ſucceſſors, rendered her exertions of power violent and frequent, and
diſcovered the full extent of her authority: The great popularity which ſhe
enjoyed, proves, that the did not infringe any eſtabliſhed liberties of the
people: There remain monuments numerous enough to aſ ertain the moſt noted
acts of her adminiſtration: And tho' th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

as a ſtronger proof, that the particular exertions of her power were

they were not thought remarkable enough to be recorded even by contemporary
writers. If there was any difference in this particular, the people, in former

               <p>BUT Martial Law went far beyond even theſe two courts in a
prompt and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and violent method of deciſion. Whenever there was any
inſurrection or public diſorder, the crown employed martial law; and it was
during that time exerciſed not only over the ſoldiers, but over the whole
people: Any one might be puniſhed as a rebel, or an aider and abettor of
rebellion, whom the provoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſhal or lieutenant of counties, or their
deputies, pleaſed to ſuſpect. Lord Bacon ſays, that the trial at common
law granted the earl of Eſſex, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low conſpirators, was a
favour: For that the caſe would have born and required the ſeverity of
martial law<note n="‖" place="bottom">Vol. IV. p. 510.</note>. We have
ſeen inſtances of its being employed by Queen Mary in defence of orthodoxy.
There remains a letter of Queen Elizabeth's to the earl of Suffex, after the
ſuppreſſion of the northern rebellion, in which ſhe reproves him
ſharply, becauſe ſhe had not heard of his having done any execution by
martial law<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">MS. of lord Royſton's from the
Paper Office.</note>. But the King of England did not always limit the
exerciſe of martial law to the times of war and rebellion. In 1552, when
there was no rebellion or inſurrection, King Edward granted a commiſſion
of martial law; and empowered the commiſſioners to execute it, <hi>as
ſhould be thought by their diſcretions moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>

was not ſparing in the uſe of martial law. In 1573, one Peter Burchet, a
puritan, being perſuaded that it was lawful or meritorious to kill ſuch as
oppoſed the truth of the goſpel, ran into the ſtreets, and wounded
Hawkins, the famous ſea-captain, whom he took for Hatton, the Queen's
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. The Queen was ſo incenſed, that ſhe ordered him to be
puniſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly by martial law; but upon the remonſtrance of ſome
prudent counſellors, who told her, that that law ought to be confined to
turbulent times, ſhe recalled her order, and delivered over Burchet to the
common law<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 449. Strype, vol. II. p.
288.</note>. But ſhe continued not always ſo reſerved in exerting this
authority. There remains a proclamation of hers, where ſhe orders martial law
to be uſed againſt all ſuch as import bulls, or even forbidden books and
pamphlets from abroad<note n="††" place="bottom">Strype, vol. III.
p. 570.</note>; and prohibits the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants <pb n="719" facs="tcp:0429000102:324"/> or their
deputies to be queſtioned for their arbitrary puniſhment of ſuch
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, <hi>any law or ſtatute to the contrary in any wiſe
notwithſtanding.</hi> We have another act of hers ſtill more extraordinary.
The ſtreets of London were very much infeſted with idle vagabonds and
riotous perſons: The lord mayor had endeavoured to repreſs this diſorder:
The Star-chamber had exerted its authority, and inflicted puniſhment on
theſe rioters: But the Queen, finding thoſe remedies ineffectual, revived
martial law, and gave Sir Thomas Wilford a commiſſion of
provoſt-marſhal: 
<q rend="inline">"Granting him authority, and commanding him,

               <p>THE Star-chamber, and High Commiſſion, and Court Martial,
tho' arbitrary juriſdictions, yet had ſtill ſome pretence of a trial, at

inflicted in that age, without any other authority than the warrant of a

impriſonment, in any jail, and during any time, that theſe miniſters
ſhould think proper. In ſuſpicious times, all the jails were full of
priſoners of ſtate; and theſe unhappy victims of public jealouſy were
ſometimes thrown into dungeons, and loaded with irons, and treated in the
moſt cruel manner, without any remedy from law.</p>
               <p>THIS practice was an indirect way of employing torture: But the
ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k itſelf was frequently
uſed, upon any ſuſpicion, without other authority than a warrant from the
ſecretary or the privy council. Even the council in the marches of Wales were
empowered, by their very commiſſion, to make uſe of torture, whenever
they thought proper<note n="*" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 196.</note>. There
cannot be a ſtronger proof how lightly the rack was employed, than the
following ſtory, told by lord Bacon. We ſhall give it in his own words. 
<q rend="inline">"The Queen was mightily incented againſt
Haywarde, on account of a book he dedicated to lord Eſſex, being a ſtory
of the firſt year of King Henry the fourth, thinking it a ſeditious prelude
to put into <pb n="720" facs="tcp:0429000102:325"/> the people's heads boldneſs and faction:
She ſaid, ſhe had an opinion that there was treaſon in it, and aſked
me, if I could not find any places in it, that might be drawn within the caſe
of treaſon: Whereto I anſwered, For treaſon, ſure I found none; but for
felony, very many: And when her majeſty haſtily aſked me, wherein? I told
her, the author had committed very apparent theft: For he had taken moſt of
the ſentences of Cornelius Tacitus, and tranſlated them into Engliſh, and
put them into his text. And another time, when the Queen could not be
perſuaded, that it was his writing whoſe name was to it, but that it had
ſome more miſchievous author, and ſaid with great indignation, that ſhe
would have him racked, to produce his author; I replied, nay, madam, he is a
doctor, never rack his perſon, but rack his ſtile: Let him have pen, ink,
and paper, and help of books, and be enjoined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſtory where it
breaketh off, and I will undertake, by collating the ſtyles, to judge whether
he were the author or no<note n="†" place="bottom">Cabbala, p.
81.</note>."</q> Thus, had it not been for Bacon's humanity, or rather his wit,
this author, a man of letters, had been put to the rack, for a moſt innocent
performance. His real offence was, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating a book to that munificent
patron of the learned, the earl of Eſſex, at a time when this nobleman lay
under diſgrace with her majeſty.</p>
               <p>THE Queen's menace of trying and puniſhing Haywarde for
treaſon, could eaſily have been executed, let his book have been ever ſo
innocent. While ſo many terrors hung over the people's heads, no jury durſt
have acquitted a man whom the court was reſolved to have condemned. The
practice alſo of not confronting the witneſſes with the priſoner, gave
the crown lawyers all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantages againſt him. And, indeed, there
occurs not one inſtance, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe reigns, that the ſovereign, or
the miniſters, were ever diſappointed in the iſſue of a proſecution.
Timid juries, and judges who held their offices during pleaſure, never failed
to ſecond all the views of the court.</p>
               <p>THE power of preſſing, and obliging any perſon to accept
of any office, was another prerogative totally incompatible with freedom.
Oſborne gives the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account of Elizabeth's method of employing this
prerogative. 
<q rend="inline">"In caſe ſhe ſound any likely to interrupt
her occaſions," ſays he, "ſhe did ſeaſonably prevent him by a
chargeable employment abroad, or putting him upon ſome ſervice at home,
which ſhe knew leaſt grateful to the people: Contrary to a falſe maxim,
ſince practiſed with far worſe ſucceſs, by ſuch princes as thought
it better husbandry to buy off enemies than reward friends<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>.</note>."</q> The practice with which Oſborne reproaches the two
immediate ſucceſſors of Elizabeth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <pb n="721" facs="tcp:0429000102:326"/>
partly from the extreme difficulty of their ſituation, partly from the
greater lenity of their diſpoſition. The power of preſſing, as may
naturally be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was often abuſed; and money was exacted by the
officers for freeing perſons from the ſervice<note n="‖" place="bottom">Murden, p. 181.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE government of England in that age, bore ſome reſemblance
to that of Turkey at preſent: The ſovereign poſſeſſed every power,
except that of impoſing taxes: And in both countries this limitation,
unſupported by other privileges, appears rather prejudicial to the people. In
Turkey, it obliges the Sultan to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the extortion of the baſhas and
governors of provinces, from whom he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſqueezes preſents, or
takes forfeitures: In England, it engaged the Queen to erect monopolies, and
grant patents for excluſive trade: An invention ſo pernicious, that had
ſhe gone on, during a tract of years, at her own rate, England, the ſeat of
riches, arts, and commerce, would have contained at preſent as little
induſtry as Morocco, or the coaſt of Barbary.</p>
               <p>WE may further obſerve, that this valuable privilege, valuable
only becauſe it proved afterwards the means by which the Parliament extorted
all their other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, was very much encroached on, in an indirect
manner, during the reign of Elizabeth, as well as of her predeceſſors. She
often exacted loans from her people; an arbitrary and unequal kind of
impoſition, and which individuals felt ſeverely: For tho' the money had
been regularly reſtored, which was ſeldom the caſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 362.</note>, it lay in the prince's hands
without intereſt, which was a ſenſible loſs to the individuals from
whom the money was borrowed.</p>
               <p>THERE remains a propoſal made by the lord Burleigh, for
levying a general loan on the people, equivalent to a ſubſidy<note n="†" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 518, 519</note>; a ſcheme which would
have laid the burthen more equally, but which was, in different words, nothing
but a taxation, impoſed without conſent of Parliament. It is remarkable,
that the ſcheme, thus propoſed, without any viſible neceſſity, by
that wiſe miniſter, is the very ſame which Henry the eighth attempted,
and which Charles the firſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by ill uſage from his Parliament, and
reduced to the greateſt difficulties, put afterwards in practice, to the
great diſcontent of the nation.</p>
               <p>THE demand of benevolence was another invention of that age for
taxing the people. This practice was ſo little conceived to be irregular,
that the commons, in 1585, offered the Queen a benevolence; which ſhe very
generouſly refuſed, as having no occaſion, at that time, for money<note n="‡" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 494.</note>. Queen Mary alſo, by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of
council, increaſed the cuſtoms in ſome branches; and her ſiſter
imitated <pb n="722" facs="tcp:0429000102:327"/> the example<note n="‖" place="bottom">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 362.</note>. There was a ſpecies of
ſhip-money impoſed at the time of the Spaniſh invaſion. The ſeveral
ports were required to equip a certain number of ſhips at their own charge;
and ſuch was the alacrity of the people for the public defence, that ſome
of the ports, particularly London, ſent double the number demanded of
them<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſon, p. 267.</note>. When any levies were
made for Ireland, France, or the Low Countries, the Queen obliged the counties
to raiſe the ſoldiers, to arm and clothe them, and carry them to the
ſea-ports at their own charge. New-Year's-Gifts were, at that time, expected
from the nobility, and from the more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable gentry<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype's Memor. vol. I. p. 137.</note>.</p>
               <p>PURVEYANCE was another method of taxation, unequal, arbitrary,
and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive. The whole kingdom felt ſenſibly the burthen of this
impoſition; and it was regarded as a great privilege which was conferred on
Oxford and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, to prohibit the purveyors from taking any commodities
within five miles of theſe univerſities. The Queen victualled her navy by
means of this preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, during the firſt years of her government<note n="‡" place="bottom">Camden, p. 388.</note>.</p>
               <p>WARDSHIP was the moſt regular and legal of all theſe
impoſitions by prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative: Yet was it a great badge of ſlavery, and
oppreſſive to the great families. When an eſtate fell to a female, the
ſovereign obliged her to marry any one he pleaſed: Whether the heir was
male or female, the crown enjoyed the whole profit of the rents during the
minority. The giving a rich wardſhip was an uſual method of rewarding a
courtier or favourite.</p>
               <p>THE inventions were endleſs, which arbitrary power might
employ for extorting of money, while the people imagined that their property
was ſecured by debarring the crown from impoſing taxes. Strype has
preſerved a ſpeech of lord Burleigh to the Queen and council, wherein are
contained ſome particulars not a little extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary<note n="§" place="bottom">Annals, vol. IV. p. 234, &amp; ſeq.</note>. Burleigh propoſes
that ſhe ſhould erect a court for the correction of all abuſes, and
ſhould confer on the commiſſioners a general inquiſitorial power over
the whole kingdom. He ſets before her eyes the example of her wiſe
grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, Henry the ſeventh, who, by ſuch methods, augmented extremely
his revenue; and he recommends, that this new court ſhould proceed, 
<q rend="inline">"as well by the direction and ordinary courſe
of the laws, as by virtue of her majeſty's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme regiment and
<hi>abſolute power, from whence law proceeded.</hi>"</q> In a word, he
expects from this inſtitution, greater acceſſion to the royal treaſure,
than Henry the eighth derived from the abolition of the abbeys, and all the
forfeitures of the eccleſiaſtical revenues. This project of lord Burleigh
needs not, I think, <pb n="723" facs="tcp:0429000102:328"/> any comment. A form of government
muſt be very arbitrary, where a wiſe and good miniſter could make ſuch
a propoſal to the ſovereign.</p>
               <p>EMBARGOES on merchandize was another engine of royal power, by
which the Engliſh princes were able to extort money from the people. We have
ſeen inſtances in the reign of Mary. Elizabeth, before her coronation,
iſſued an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the cuſtom-houſe, prohibiting the ſale of all
crimſon ſilks which ſhould be imported, till the court was firſt
provided<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype, vol. I. p. 27.</note>. She expected,
no doubt, a good penny-worth from the merchants, while they lay under this
reſtraint.</p>
               <p>THE Parliament pretended to the right of enacting laws, as well
as of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſidies; but this privilege was, during that age, ſtill
more inſignificant than the other. Queen Elizabeth expreſsly prohibited
them from meddling with ſtate matters or eccleſiaſtical cauſes; and
ſhe openly ſent the members to priſon, who dared to tranſgreſs her
imperial edict in theſe particulars. There paſſed few Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
during her reign, where there occur not inſtances of this arbitrary
conduct.</p>
               <p>BUT the legiſlative power of the Parliament was a mere
fallacy, while the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign was univerſally acknowleged to poſſeſs
a diſpenſing power, by which all the laws could be invalidated, and
rendered of no effect. The uſe of this power was alſo an indirect method
practiſed for erecting monopolies. Where the ſtatutes laid any branch of
manufacture under reſtrictions, the ſovereign, by exempting one perſon
from the laws, gave him in effect the monopoly of that commodity<note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer, tom. W. p.

               <p>BUT in reality, the crown poſſeſſed the full
legiſlative power, by means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, which might affect any
ſubject of the greateſt importance, and which the Star-chamber took care to
ſee more rigorouſly executed than the laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The motives of
theſe proclamations were ſometimes very ridiculous. Queen Elizabeth had
taken offence at the ſmell of woad; and ſhe iſſued an edict prohibiting
any one to cultivate that uſeful plant<note n="‖" place="bottom">Townſend's Journal, p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="724" facs="tcp:0429000102:329"/> THE Queen's prohibition of the
propheſyings was founded on a better reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhews ſtill the
unlimited extent of her prerogative. Two or three people could not meet
together, in order to read the ſcriptures, and confer about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, tho'
in ever ſo orthodox a manner, without her permiſſion.</p>
               <p>THERE were many other branches of prerogative incompatible with
an exact or regular enjoyment of liberty. None of the nobility could marry
without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the ſovereign. The Queen detained the earl of
Southampton long in priſon, becauſe he privately married the earl of
Eſſex's couſin<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p.
422.</note>. No man could travel without the conſent of the prince. Sir
William Evers underwent a ſevere perſecution, becauſe he had preſumed
to pay a private viſit to the King of Scots<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 511.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Parliament in the thirteenth of the Queen praiſed her for
not imitating the practice, uſual among her predeceſſors, of ſtopping
the courſe of juſtice by particular warrants<note n="‡" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 141.</note>. There could not poſſibly be a greater
abuſe, nor a ſtronger mark of arbitrary power; and the Queen, in refraining
from it, was very laudable. But ſhe was by no means conſtant in this
reſerve. There remain in the public records ſome warrants of her's for
exempting perſons from all law-ſuits and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 652, 708, 777.</note>; and theſe warrants,
ſhe ſays, ſhe grants from her royal prerogative, which ſhe will not
allow to be diſputed.</p>
               <p>IT is eaſy to imagine, that, in ſuch a government, no
juſtice could, by courſe of law, be obtained of the ſovereign, unleſs
he was willing to allow it. In the naval expedition, undertaken by Raleigh and
Forbiſher againſt the Spaniards, in 1592, a very rich carrack was taken
worth two hundred thouſand pounds. The Queen's ſhare in the adventure was
only a tenth part; but as the prize was ſo great, and exceeded ſo much the
expectations of all the adventurers, ſhe was determined not to reſt
contented with her ſhare. Raleigh, humbly and earneſtly, begged her to
accept of an hundred thouſand pounds, in lieu of all demands, or rather
exactions; and ſays, that the preſent, which the proprietors were willing
to make her of eighty thouſand pounds, was the greateſt that ever a prince
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from a ſubject<note n="§" place="bottom">Strype, vol. IV. p.
128, 129.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT it is no wonder the Queen, in her adminiſtration, ſhould
pay ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to liberty; while the parliament itſelf, in enacting
laws, were ſo entirely negligent of it. The perſecuting ſtatutes, which
they paſſed againſt papiſts and puritans, are extremely contrary to the
genius of freedom; and by expoſing ſuch multitudes to the tyranny of
prieſts and bigots, accuſtomed the people to the <pb n="725" facs="tcp:0429000102:330"/>
moſt diſgraceful ſubjection. Their conferring an unlimited ſupremacy on
the Queen, or what is worſe, acknowleging her inherent right to it, was
another proof of their voluntary ſervitude.</p>
               <p>THE law of the 23d of her reign, making ſeditious words
againſt the Queen capital, is another very tyrannical ſtatute; and an
uſe, no leſs tyrannical, was ſometimes made of it. The caſe of Udal, a
puritannical clergyman, ſeems ſingular, even in thoſe arbitrary times.
This man had publiſhed a book called a demonſtration of diſcipline, in
which he inveighed againſt the government of biſhops; and tho' he had
carefully endeavoured to conceal his name, he was thrown into priſon upon
ſuſpicion, and brought to his trial for this offence. It was pretended,
that the biſhops were part of the Queen's political body; and to ſpeak
againſt them, was really to attack her, and was therefore felony by the
ſtatute. This was not the only iniquity, to which Udal was expoſed. The
judges would not allow the jury to determine any thing but the fact, whether
Udal had wrote the book, or not, without examining his intention, or the
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the words. In order to prove the fact, the crown lawyers did not
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſingle witneſs to the court: They only read the teſtimony of
two perſons abſent, one of which ſaid that Udal had told him he was the
author; another, that a friend of Udal's had ſaid ſo. They would not allow
Udal to produce any exculpatory evidence; which, they ſaid, was never to be
permitted againſt the Queen. And they tendered him an oath, by which he was
required to ſwear, that he was not author of the book; and his refuſal to
give that teſtimony was employed as the ſtrongeſt proof of his guilt. It
is almoſt needleſs to add, that, notwithſtanding theſe multiplied

               <p>THE caſe of Penry was, if poſſible, ſtill harder. This
man was a zealous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, or rather a Browniſt; and he had wrote againſt
the hierarchy ſeveral tracts, ſuch as Martin Mar-prelate, <hi>Theſes
Martinianae,</hi> and other compoſitions full of low ſcurrility and
petulant ſatyre. After concealing himſelf for ſome years, he was
ſeized; and as the ſtatute againſt ſeditious words required that the
crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſhould be tried within a year after committing the offence, he
could not be indicted for his printed books. He was therefore tried for ſome
papers found in his pocket, as if he had thereby ſcattered ſedition<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype's Life of Whitgift, book IV. chap. II. Neal,
vol. I. p. 564.</note>. It was alſo imputed to him, by the lord keeper,
Puckering, that in ſome of theſe papers, 
<q rend="inline">"he had only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged <pb n="726" facs="tcp:0429000102:331"/>
her majeſty's royal power to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> laws, eccleſiaſtical

moſt abſolute authority<note n="‡" place="bottom">Strype, vol. IV. p.
177.</note>."</q> Penry for theſe offences was condemned and executed.</p>
               <p>THUS we have ſeen, that <hi>the moſt abſolute</hi>
authority of the ſovereign, to make uſe of the lord keeper's phraſe, was
eſtabliſhed on above twenty branches of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, which are now
aboliſhed, and which were, every one of them, totally incompatible with the
liberty of the ſubject. But what enſured more effectually the ſlavery of
the people, than even theſe branches of prerogative, was, the
eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed principles of the times, which attributed to the prince ſuch
an abſolute and indefeizable authority, as was ſuppoſed to be the origin
of all law, and could be bound and circumſcribed by none. The homilies,
publiſhed for the uſe of the clergy, and which they were enjoined to read
every Sunday in all the churches, inculcate every where a blind, and unlimited
paſſive-obedience to the prince, which, on no account, and under no
pretence, is it ever lawful for them, in the ſmalleſt article, to depart
from or infringe. Much noiſe has been made, becauſe ſome court chaplains,
during the ſucceeding reigns, were permitted to preach ſuch doctrines; but
there is a great difference between theſe ſermons, and diſcourſes
publiſhed by authority, avowed by the prince and council, and promulgated to
the whole nation<note n="*" place="bottom">Gifford, a clergyman, was
ſuſpended in 1584, for preaching up a limited obedience to the civil
magiſtrate. Neal, vol. I. p. 435.</note>. So thoroughly were theſe
principles imbibed by the people, during the reigns of Elizabeth and her
predeceſſors, that oppoſition to them was regarded as the moſt flagrant
ſedition, and was not even rewarded by that public praiſe and approbation,
which can alone ſupport men under ſuch dangers and difficulties, as attend
the reſiſtance of tyrannical authority. It was only during the next
generation that the noble principles of liberty took root, and ſpreading
themſelves, under the ſhelter of puritannical abſurdities, became
faſhionable among the people.</p>
               <p>IT is worth remarking, that the advantage, uſually aſcribed
to abſolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, a greater regularity of police and a more ſtrict
execution of the laws, did not attend the antient Engliſh government, tho' in
many reſpects it fell under that denomination: A demonſtration of this
truth is contained in a judicious paper, which is preſerved by Strype<note n="†" place="bottom">Annals, vol. IV. p. 290. &amp; ſeq.</note>, and
which was wrote by an eminent juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of peace of Somerſetſhire, in the
year 1596, near the end of the Queen's reign, when the authority of that
princeſs may be ſuppoſed to be fully corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by time, and her
maxims of government improved by long practice. This <pb n="727" facs="tcp:0429000102:332"/>
paper contains an account of the diſorders which then prevailed in the county
of Somerſet. The author ſays, that forty perſons had been there executed
in a year for robberies, thefts, and other felonies; thirty-five burnt in the
hand, thirty-ſeven whipt, one hundred and eighty-three diſcharged: That
thoſe who were diſcharged were moſt wicked and deſperate perſons, who
never could come to any good, becauſe they would not work, and none would
take them into ſervice: That notwithſtanding this great number of
indictments, the fifth part of the felonies committed in the county were not
brought to a trial, the greater number eſcaped cenſure, either from the
ſuperior cunning of the ſelons, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs of the magiſtrates,
or the fooliſh lenity of the people: That the rapines committed by the
infinite number of wicked, wandering, idle people were into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to the poor
countrymen, and obliged them to a perpetual watch of their ſheep-folds, their
paſtures, their woods and their corn-fields: That the other counties of
England were in no better condition than Somerſetſhire; and many of them
were even in a worſe: That there were at leaſt three or four hundred
able<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied vagabonds in every county, who lived by theft and rapine; and who
ſometimes met in troops to the number of ſixty, and committed ſpoil on
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants: That if all the felons of this kind were aſſembled, they
would be able, if reduced to good ſubjection, to give the greateſt enemy
her majeſty has a ſtrong battle: And that the magiſtrates themſelves
were intimidated from executing juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice upon them; and there were examples
of juſtices of peace, who, after giving ſentence againſt rogues, had
interpoſed to ſtop the execution of their own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for fear of the
danger, which hung over them from the confederates of theſe felons.</p>
               <p>IN the year 1575, the Queen complained in Parliament of the bad
execution of the laws; and threatened, if the magiſtrates were not, for the
future, more vigilant, that ſhe would entruſt authority to indigent and
needy perſons, who would find an intereſt in the more exact diſtribution
of juſtice<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 23<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note>. It appears, that ſhe was as good as her
word. For in 1601, there were great complaints made in Parliament of the rapine
of juſtices of peace; and a member ſaid, that this magiſtrate was an
animal, who, for half a dozen of chickens, would

not eaſy to account for this relaxation of government, and neglect of police
during a reign of ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as
that of Elizabeth. The ſmall revenue of the crown is the moſt likely cause
that can be aſſigned. The Queen had it not in her power to intereſt a
great number in aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to execute the laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="728" facs="tcp:0429000102:333"/> ON the whole, the Engliſh have no
reaſon, from the example of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, to be in love with the
picture of abſolute monarchy; or to prefer the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited authority of the
prince, and his unbounded prerogatives, to that noble liberty, that ſweet
equality, and that happy ſecurity, by which they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
diſtinguiſhed above all nations of the univerſe. The utmoſt that can be
ſaid in favour of the antient government (and perhaps it may be ſaid with
truth) is, that the power of the prince, tho' really unlimited, was exerciſed
after the European manner, and entered not into every part of the
adminiſtration; that the inſtances of a high exerted prerogative were not
ſo frequent as to render pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ſenſibly inſecure, or reduce the
people to a total ſervitude; that the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from faction, the quickneſs
of execution, and the promptitude of thoſe meaſures, which could be taken
for offence or defence, made ſome compenſation for the want of a legal and
determined liberty; that as the prince commanded no mercenary army, there was a
tacit check on him, which maintained the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in that medium, to which
the people had been accuſtomed; and that this ſituation of England was in
reality more remote, tho' ſeemingly it approached nearer, a deſpotic and
eaſtern monarchy, than the preſent government of that kingdom, where the
people, tho' guarded by multiplied laws, are totally naked, defenceleſs, and
diſarmed.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall cloſe this volume with a brief account of the
revenues, the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force, the commerce, the arts, and the learning of
England during this period.</p>
               <p>QUEEN Elizabeth's oeconomy was very remarkable; and in ſome
inſtances ſeemed to border on avarice. The ſmalleſt expence, if it
could poſſibly be ſaved, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared conſiderable in her eyes; and even
the charge of an expreſs, during the moſt delicate tranſactions, was not
below her notice<note n="*" place="bottom">Birch's Negot. p. 21.</note>. She was
alſo attentive to every profit; and embraced opportunities of gain, which may
appear ſomewhat extraordinary. She kept the ſee of Ely vacant nineteen
years, in order to pocket the revenue<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype,
vol. IV. p. 351.</note>; and it was uſual with her, when ſhe promoted a
biſhop, to take the opportunity of pillaging the ſee of ſome of its
manors<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 215.</note>. But that there was
in reality little or no avarice in the Queen's temper appears from this
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that ſhe never amaſſed any treaſure; and even
refuſed ſubſidies from the Parliament, when ſhe had no preſent
occaſion for them. Yet we muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from this circumſtance, that
her oeconomy proceeded from a tender concern for her people: She loaded them
with monopolies and excluſive patents, which are infinitely more
oppreſſive than the moſt heavy taxes, levied in a legal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular 
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:0429000102:334"/> manner. The real ſource of her frugal conduct was
derived from her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of independency, and her care to preſerve her
dignity, which would have been endangered, had ſhe reduced herſelf to the
neceſſity of having frequent recourſe to parliamentary ſupplies. In
conſequence of this motive, the Queen, tho' en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſucceſsful and
neceſſary wars, thought it more prudent to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dilapidation
of the royal demeſnes<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 141.
D'Ewes, p. 151, 457, 525, 629. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 363.</note>, than demand the
moſt moderate ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from the commons. As ſhe lived unmarried and had
no poſterity, ſhe was contented to ſerve her preſent turn, tho' at the
expence of her ſucceſſors, who, by reaſon of this policy, joined to
other accidents, found themſelves, on a ſudden, reduced to the moſt
extreme indigence.</p>
               <p>THE ſplendor of a court was, during this age, a great part of
the public charge; and as Elizabeth was a ſingle woman, and expenſive in no
ſpecies of magnificence, except cloaths, this circumſtance enabled her to
perform great things by her narrow revenue. She is ſaid to have paid four
millions of debt, left on the crown by her father, brother and ſiſter; an
incredible ſum for that age<note n="†" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 473. I
think it impoſſible to reconcile this account of the public debts with that
given by Strype, Eccleſ. Mem. vol. II. p. 344. that in the year 1553, the
crown owed but 300,000 pounds. I own, that this laſt ſum appears a great
deal more likely. The whole revenue of Queen Elizabeth would not in ten years
have paid four millions.</note>. The ſtates at the time of her death owed her
about eight hundred thouſand pounds: And the King of France four hundred and
fifty thouſand<note n="‡" place="bottom">Winwood, vol. I. p. 29,
54.</note>. Tho' that prince was extremely frugal, and after the peace of
Vervins, was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally amaſſing treaſure, the Queen never could, by
the moſt preſſing remonſtrances, prevail on him to make payment of
thoſe ſums, which ſhe had ſo generouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him, during his
greateſt diſtreſſes. One payment of twenty thouſand crowns, and
another of fifty thouſand, were all ſhe could obtain, by the ſtrongeſt
repreſentations ſhe could make of the difficulties to which the rebellion
in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had reduced her<note n="¶" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 117,
395.</note>. The Queen expended on the wars with Spain between 1589 and 1593,
the ſum of one million three hundred thouſand pounds, beſide the double
ſubſidy, amounting to two hundred and eighty thouſand pounds, granted her
by Parliament<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 483.</note>. In the
year 1599 ſhe ſpent ſix hundred thouſand pounds in ſix months in the
ſervice of Ireland<note n="**" place="bottom">Camden, p. 167.</note>. Sir
Robert Cecil affirmed, that in ten years time, Ireland coſt her three
millions four hundred thouſand pounds<note n="‖" place="bottom">Appendix
to the earl of Eſſex's apology.</note>. She gave the earl of Eſſex a
preſent of thirty thouſand pounds upon his departure for the government of
that kingdom<note n="§" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II.</note>.
Lord Burleigh computed <pb n="730" facs="tcp:0429000102:335"/> that the value of the gifts
conferred on that favourite amounted to three hundred thouſand pounds: A
proof of her ſtrong affection towards him! It was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying during
this reign; <hi>The Queen pays bountifully, tho' ſhe rewards
ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Nanton's Regalia, chap.
I.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT is difficult to compute exactly the Queen's ordinary revenue,
but it certainly fell much ſhort of five hundred thouſand pounds a year. In
1590, ſhe raiſed the cuſtoms from fourteen thouſand pounds a year to
fifty thouſand pounds; and obliged Sir Thomas Smith, who had farmed them, to
refund ſome of his former profits<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden, p. 558.
This account of Camden is difficult or impoſſible to be reconciled to the
ſtate of the cuſtoms in the beginning of the ſubſequent reign, as they
appear in the journals of the commons. See Hiſt. of Great Britain, vol. I.
chap. 1.</note>. This improvement of the revenue was owing to the
ſuggeſtions of one Caermarden; and was extremely oppoſed by Burleigh,
Leiceſter, and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham. But the Queen's preſeverance overcame all
their oppoſition. The great undertakings, which ſhe executed with ſo
narrow a revenue, and with ſuch ſmall ſupplies from her people, prove the
mighty effects of wiſdom and oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. She received from the Parliament,
during the courſe of her whole reign, only twenty ſubſidies and
thirty-nine fifteenths. It is not eaſy to compute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the amount of
theſe ſupplies; becauſe the value of a ſubſidy was continually
falling; and in the end of her reign it amounted only to eighty thouſand
pounds<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">D'Ewes, p. 630.</note>, which in the
beginning had been an hundred and twenty thouſand. If we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that
the whole ſupplies granted Elizabeth during a reign of forty-five years
amounted to three millions, we ſhall not probably be much wide of the truth.
This ſum makes only ſixty-ſix thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty-ſix
pounds a year; and it is ſurprizing, that while the Queen's demands were ſo
moderate, and her expences ſo well regulated, ſhe ſhould ever have found
any difficulty of getting a ſupply from the Parliament, or be reduced to make
ſale of the crown-lands. But ſuch was the extreme, I had almoſt ſaid,
abſurd parſimony of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments during that period. They valued
nothing in compariſon of their money: The members had no connexion with the
court; and the very idea, which they conceived of the truſt committed to
them, was, to reduce the demands of the crown, and to grant as few ſupplies
as poſſible. The crown, on the other hand, conceived the Parliament in no
other light than a means of ſupply. Queen Elizabeth made a merit to her
people of ſeldom aſſembling Parliaments<note n="‡" place="bottom">Strype, vol. IV. p. 124.</note>. No redreſs of grievances was
expected from theſe aſſemblies: They were ſuppoſed to meet for no
other purpoſe than to impoſe taxes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="731" facs="tcp:0429000102:336"/> BEFORE Queen Elizabeth's reign, the
Engliſh princes had always recourſe to the city of Antwerp for voluntary
loans; and their credit was ſo low, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the exorbitant
intereſt of ten or twelve per cent, they were obliged to make the city of
London join in the ſecurity. Sir Thomas Greſham, that great and
enterprizing merchant, one of the chief ornaments of this reign, engaged the
company of merchant-adventurers to grant a loan to the Queen; and as the money
was regularly paid, her credit by degrees eſtabliſhed itſelf in the city,
and ſhe ſhook off this dependance on foreigners<note n="*" place="bottom">Stowe's Survey of London, book I. p. 286.</note>.</p>
               <p>In 1559, the Queen employed Greſham to borrow for her two
hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds at Antwerp, in order to enable her to reform the
coinage, which was at that time extremely debaſed<note n="†" place="bottom">MS. of lord Royſton's from the paper office, p.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>95.</note>. She was ſo unpolitic
as to make herſelf an innovation in the coin; by dividing a pound of ſilver
into ſixty-two ſhillings, inſtead of ſixty, the former ſtandard. This
is the laſt time, that the coin has been tampered with in England.</p>
               <p>QUEEN Elizabeth, ſenſible how much the defence of her
kingdom depended on its naval power, was deſirous to encourage commerce and
navigation: But as her monopolies tended to extinguiſh all domeſtic
induſtry, which is much more valuable than foreign trade, and is the
foundation of it, the general train of her conduct was very ill calculated to
ſerve the purpoſe at which ſhe aimed, much leſs to promote the riches
of her people. The excluſive companies alſo were an immediate check on
foreign trade. Yet, notwithſtanding theſe diſcouragements, the ſpirit
of the age was ſtrongly bent on naval enterprizes; and beſides the
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary expeditions againſt the Spaniards, many attempts were made for new
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and many new branches of foreign commerce were opened by the
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. Sir Martin Forbiſher undertook three fruitleſs voyages to
diſcover the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt paſſage: Davis, not diſheartened by this ill
ſucceſs, made a new attempt, when he diſcovered the ſtraits, which
paſs by his name. In 1600, the Queen granted the firſt patent to the Eaſt
India company: The ſtock of that company was ſeventy-two thouſand pounds;
and they fitted out four ſhips, under the command of James Lancaſter, for
this new branch of trade. The adventure was ſucceſsful; and the ſhips
returning with a rich cargo, encouraged the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to continue that
commerce.</p>
               <p>THE communication with Muſcovy had been opened in Queen Mary's
time by the diſcovery of the paſſage to Archangel: But the commerce to
that country began not to be carried to a great extent till about the year
15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9. The Queen 
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:0429000102:337"/> obtained from the Czar an excluſive patent to the
Engliſh for the whole trade to Muſcovy<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Camden, p. 408.</note>; and ſhe entered into a perſonal, as
well as national, alliance with him. This Czar was named John Baſilides, a
moſt furious tyrant, who ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually the revolt of his
ſubjects, ſtipulated a ſafe retreat and protection in England. In order
the better to enſure himſelf of this reſource, he propoſed to marry an
Engliſh woman, and the Queen intended to have ſent him the lady Anne
Haſtings, daughter to the earl of Huntingdon: But when the lady was informed
of the barbarous manners of the country, ſhe wiſely declined pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
an empire at the expence of her eaſe and ſafety<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 493.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Engliſh, encouraged by the privileges, which they had
obtained from Baſilides, ventured farther into theſe countries, than any
Europeans had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done. They tranſported their goods along the river
Dwina in boats made of one entire tree, which they towed and rowed up the
ſtream as far as Walogda. From thence, they carried them ſeven days journey
by land to Yeraſtau, and then down the Volga to Aſtracan. At Aſtracan,
they built ſhips, croſſed the Caſpian Sea, and diſtributed their
commodities into Perſia. But this bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt met with ſuch
diſcouragements that it was never renewed<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 418.</note>.</p>
               <p>AFTER the death of John Baſilides, his ſon Theodore revoked
the patent, which the Engliſh enjoyed for a monopoly of the Ruſſian
trade; and when the Queen remonſtrated againſt this innovation, he told her
miniſters, that princes muſt carry an indifferent hand, as well between
their ſubjects as between fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; and not convert trade, which by the
laws of nations ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, into a monopoly for the private
gain of a few<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 493.</note>. So much
juſter notions of commerce were entertained by this barbarian, than were
practiſed by the renowned Queen Elizabeth! Theodore, however, continued
ſome privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges to the Engliſh, on account of their being the firſt
diſcoverers of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between Europe and his country.</p>
               <p>THE trade to Turkey was begun about 1583; and that commerce was
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately confined to a company by Queen Elizabeth. Before that time, the
grand ſignior had always conceived England to be a dependant province of
France<note n="‖" place="bottom">Birch's Memoirs, vol. I. p. 36.</note>;
but having heard of the Queen's power and reputation, he gave a good recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Engliſh, and even granted them larger privileges than he had given to
the French.</p>
               <p>THE merchants of the Hanſe-towns complained loudly in the
beginning of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth's reign of the treatment, which they had received in
the days of King <pb n="733" facs="tcp:0429000102:338"/> Edward and Queen Mary. She very
prudently replied, that as ſhe would not innovate any thing, ſhe would
protect them ſtill in the immunities and privileges, which ſhe found them
poſſeſſed of. This anſwer not contenting them, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was
ſoon after ſuſpended for a time, to the great advantage of the Engliſh
merchants, who tried what they could themſelves effectuate for the promotion
of their commerce. They took the whole trade into their own hands; and their
returns proving ſucceſsful, they divided themſelves into ſtaplers and
merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventurers; the former reſiding conſtantly at one place, the
other trying their fortunes in other towns and ſtates abroad with cloth and
other manufactures. This ſucceſs ſo enraged the Hanſe-towns, that they
tried all the methods, which a diſcontented people could deviſe, to draw
upon the Engliſh merchants the ill opinion of other nations and ſtates.
They prevailed ſo far as to obtain an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial edict, by which the Engliſh
merchants were prohibited all commerce in the empire: The Queen, by way of
retaliation, retained ſixty of their ſhips, which had been ſeized in the
river of Liſbon with contraband goods of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. Theſe ſhips the
Queen intended to have reſtored, as deſiring to have compromiſed all
differences with thoſe trading cities; but when ſhe was informed, that a
general aſſembly was held at Lubec, in order to concert meaſures for
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing the Engliſh trade, ſhe cauſed the ſhips and cargoes
to be confiſcated; only two of them were releaſed to carry home the news,
and to inform theſe ſtates, that ſhe had the greateſt contempt
imaginable for all their proceedings<note n="*" place="bottom">Lives of the
Admirals. vol. I. p. 470.</note>.</p>
               <p>HENRY the eighth, in order to fit out a navy, was obliged to
hire ſhips from Hamburg, Lubec, Dantzick, Genoa, and Venice: But Elizabeth,
very early in her reign, put affairs upon a better footing; both by building
ſome ſhips of her own, and by encouraging the merchants to build large
trading veſſels, which, on occaſion, were converted into ſhips of

number of veſſels twelve hundred and thirty-two; of which there were only
two hundred and ſeventeen above eighty tons. Monſon computes, that tho' the
navigation decayed in the firſt years of James the firſt, by the practice
of the merchants, who carried on their trade in foreign bottoms<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 300.</note>, yet before 1640, this number of

               <p>THE navy which the Queen left at her deceaſe appears
conſiderable, when we conſider only the number of veſſels, which were
forty-two: But when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that none of theſe ſhips carried above
forty guns; that four only came up <pb n="734" facs="tcp:0429000102:339"/> to that number; that
there were but two ſhips of a thouſand ton; and twenty-three below five
hundred, ſome of fifty, and ſome even of twenty tons; that the whole number
of the guns belonging to the fleet were ſeven hundred and ſeventy-four<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſon, p. 196. The Engliſh navy at preſent carries

Engliſh navy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the force which it has now attained. In the year
1588, there were not above five veſſels, equipped by the noblemen and
ſea-ports, which exceeded two hundred tons<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 300.</note>.</p>
               <p>IN 1599, an alarm was given of an invaſion from the Spaniards;
and the Queen equipped a fleet and levied an army in a fortnight to oppoſe
them. Nothing gave foreigners a higher idea of the power of England than this
ſudden arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In 1575, all the militia in the kingdom were computed at an

Theſe armies were formidable by their numbers; but their diſcipline and
experience were not proportioned. Small bodies from Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk and Newport
frequently ran over, and plundered the eaſt coaſt: So unfit was the
militia, as it was then conſtituted, for the defence of the kingdom. The lord

               <p>MR. MURDEN<note n="§" place="bottom">p. 608.</note> has
publiſhed a paper, which contains the military force of the nation at the
time of the Spaniſh Armada, and which is ſomewhat different from the
account given by our ordinary hiſtorians. It makes the whole able<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied men
of the kingdom amount to an hundred and eleven thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and

of whom forty four thouſand ſeven hundred and twenty-ſeven were trained.
It muſt be ſuppoſed that theſe able-bodied men conſiſted of ſuch

computation is not indeed to be eſteemed an exact eſtimate of their wealth.
In 1567, there were found on enquiry to be four thouſand eight hundred and
fifty-one ſtrangers of all nations in London: Of whom three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eight
hundred and thirty-eight were Flemiſh, and only fifty-eight Scotch<note n="**" place="bottom">Haynes, p. 461, 462.</note>. The perſecut ons in France
and the Low Countries drove afterwards a greater number of foreigners into
England; and the commerce, as well as manufactures, <pb n="735" facs="tcp:0429000102:340"/> of
that kingdom was very much improved by them<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 668.</note>. It was then that Sir Thomas Greſham
built, at his own charge, the magnificent fabric of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the
reception of the merchants: The Queen viſited it, and gave it the appellation
of the Royal Exchange.</p>
               <p>THERE were two attempts made in this reign to ſettle colonies
in America; one by Sir Humphry Gilbert in Newfoundland, another by Sir Walter
Raleigh in Virginia: But neither of theſe projects proved ſucceſsful. All
theſe noble ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements were made in the following reigns. The current
money of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the end of this reign, is computed at four
millions<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">Lives of the Admirals, vol. I.
p. 475.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE nobility in this age ſupported a great deal of the ancient
magnificence in their hoſpitality, and in the numbers of their retainers; and
the Queen found it prudent to retrench, by proclamation, their expences in this
laſt particular<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p.
54.</note>. The expence of hoſpitality, ſhe ſomewhat encouraged, by the
frequent viſits ſhe paid her nobility, and the magnificent feaſts which
ſhe received from them. The earl of Leiceſter gave her an entertainment in
Kenibworth caſtle, which was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for expence and magnificence.
Among other particulars, we are told, that three hundred and ſixty-five
hogſheads of beer were drank at it<note n="†" place="bottom">Biogr.
Brit. vol. III. p. 1791.</note>. The earl had fortified this caſtle at great
expence; and it contained arms for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men<note n="‡" place="bottom">Strype, vol. III. p. 394.</note>. The earl of Derby had a family
conſiſting of two hundred and forty ſervants<note n="‖" place="bottom">Stowe, p. 674.</note>. Stowe remarks it as a ſingular proof of
beneficence in this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, that he was contented with his rent from his
tenants, and exacted not any extraordinary ſervices from them: A proof that
the abſolute power of the ſovereign, what was unavoidable, had very
generally countenanced the nobility in tyrannizing over the people. Burleigh,
tho' he was frugal, and had no pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate; kept a family conſiſting
of an hundred ſervants<note n="§" place="bottom">Strype, vol. III. p. 129.
Appen.</note>. He had a ſtanding table for gentlemen, and two other tables
for perſons of meaner condition, which were always ſerved alike, whether he
were in town or in the country. About his perſon he had people of great
diſtinction, inſomuch that he could reckon up twenty gentlemen retainers
who had each a thouſand pounds a year; and as many among his ordinary
ſervants, who were worth from a thouſand pounds to three, five, ten, and
twenty thouſand pounds<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Biogr. Brit. p.
1267.</note>. It is to be remarked, that, tho' the revenue of the crown was at
that time very ſmall, the miniſters and courtiers found means, by employing
the exorbitant prerogative, to acquire much greater fortunes than it is
poſſible for them at preſent to gain, from their larger ſalaries, and
more limited authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="736" facs="tcp:0429000102:341"/> BUT tho' there were preſerved great
remains of the ancient cuſtoms, the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were, by degrees, acquiring a
taſte of elegant luxury; and many edifices, in particular, were built by
them, neat, large, and ſumptuous, to the great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the kingdom,
ſays Camden<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 452</note>; but to the no leſs
decay of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hoſpitality of the nation. It is, however, more
reaſonable to think, that this new turn of expence promoted arts and
induſtry; while the ancient hoſpitality was the ſource of vice,
diſorder, ſedition, and idleneſs.</p>
               <p>AMONG the other ſpecies of luxury, that of apparel began much
to increaſe during this age; and the Queen thought proper to reſtrain it by
proclamation<note n="†" place="bottom">Camden, p. 452.</note>. Her example
was very little conformable to her edicts. As no woman was ever more conceited
of her beauty, nor more deſirous of making impreſſion on the hearts of
beholders, no one ever went to a greater extravagance in apparel, or ſtudied
more the variety and richneſs of her dreſs. She appeared almoſt every day
in a different habit; and tried all the ſeveral modes, by which ſhe hoped
to render herſelf agreeable. She was alſo ſo fond of her cloaths, that
ſhe never could part with any of them; and at her death ſhe had in her
wardrobe all the different habits, to the number of three thouſand, which
ſhe had ever worn in her life-time<note n="‡" place="bottom">Carte, vol.
III. p. 702. from Beaumont's Diſpatches.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE retrenchment of the ancient hoſpitality, and the
diminution of retainers, were favourable to the prerogative of the ſovereign;
and by diſabling the great noblemen from reſiſtance, promoted the
execution of the laws, and extended the authority of the courts of juſtice.
There were many particular cauſes in the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and character of Henry
the ſeventh, which augmented the authority of the crown: Moſt of theſe
cauſes concurred in ſucceeding princes; together with the factions of
religion, and the acquiſition of the ſupremacy, a moſt important ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of prerogative: But the manners of the age were a general cauſe, which
operated during this whole period, and which continually tended to diminiſh
the riches, and ſtill more the influence of the Ariſtocracy, anciently ſo
formidable to the crown. The habits of luxury diſſipated the immenſe
fortunes of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent barons; and as the new methods of expence gave
ſubſiſtance to mechanics and merchants, who lived in an independant
manner on the fruits of their own induſtry, a nobleman, inſtead of that
unlimited aſcendant which he was wont to aſſume over thoſe who were
maintained at his board, or ſubſiſted by ſalaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on them,
retained only that moderate influence which cuſtomers have over 
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:0429000102:342"/> tradeſmen, and which can never be dangerous to civil
government. The land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proprietors alſo, having a greater demand for money than
for men, endeavoured to turn their lands to the beſt account with regard to
profit, and either incloſing their fields, or joining many ſmall farms into
a few large ones, diſcharged thoſe uſeleſs hands which formerly were
always at their call, in every attempt to ſubvert the government, or oppoſe
a neighbouring baron. By all theſe means the cities increaſed; the middle
rank of men began to be rich and powerful; the prince, who, in effect, was the
ſame with the law, was implicitly obeyed; and tho' the farther progreſs of
the ſame cauſes begot a new plan of liberty, founded on the privileges of
the commons, yet in the interval between the fall of the nobles and the riſe
of this order, the ſovereign took advantage of the preſent ſituation, and
aſſumed an authority almoſt abſolute.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER may be commonly imagined, from the authority of lord
Bacon, and from that of Harrington, and later authors, the laws of Henry the
ſeventh contributed very little towards the great revolutions which happened
about this period in the Engliſh conſtitution. The practice of breaking
entails by a fine and recovery, had been introduced in the preceding reigns;
and this prince only gave indirectly a legal ſanction to the practice, by
reforming ſome abuſes which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. But the ſettled authority which
he acquired to the crown, enabled the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign to encroach on the
ſeparate juriſdictions of the barons, and produced a more general and
regular execution of the laws. The counties palatine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the ſame fate
as the feudal juriſdictions; and by a ſtatute of Henry the eighth<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Hon.
VIII. c. 21.</note>, the juriſdiction of theſe counties was annexed to the
crown, and all writs were ordained to run in the King's name. But the change of
manners was the chief cauſe of the ſecret revolution of the government, and
ſubverted the power of the barons.</p>
               <p>LEARNING, on its firſt revival, was held in great eſtimation
by the Engliſh princes and nobles; and as it was not yet proſtituted by
being too common, even the Great deemed it an object of ambition to attain a
character for literature. The four ſucceſſive ſovereigns, Henry,
Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, may, on one account or other, be admitted into the
claſs of authors. Queen Catherine Parr tranſlated a book: Lady Jane Gray,
conſidering her age, and her ſex, and her ſtation, may be regarded as a
prodigy of literature. Sir Thomas Smith was raiſed from being profeſſor
in Cambridge, firſt to be ambaſſador to France, and then ſecretary of
ſtate. The diſpatches of thoſe times, and among others thoſe of 
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:0429000102:343"/> Burleigh himſelf, are very frequently interlarded with
quotations from the Greek and Latin claſſics. Even the ladies of the court
valued themſelves on knowlege: Lady Burleigh, lady Bacon, and their two
ſiſters, were miſtreſſes of the ancient, as well as modern languages;
and valued themſelves more on their eurdition than on their rank and
quality.</p>
               <p>QUEEN Elizabeth wrote and tranſlated ſeveral books; and
ſhe was familiarly acquainted with the Greek as well as Latin tongue. It is
pretended, that ſhe made an extemporary reply in Greek to the univerſity of
Cambridge, who had addreſſed her in that language. It is certain, that
ſhe anſwered in Latin, without prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and in a very ſpirited
manner, to the Poliſh ambaſſador, who had been wanting in reſpect to
her. When ſhe had finiſhed, ſhe turned about to her courtiers, and
ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"God's death, my lords," (for ſhe was much
addicted to ſwearing) "I have been forced this day to ſcour up my old
Latin, that hath long lain ruſting<note n="‡" place="bottom">Speed.</note>."</q> Elizabeth, even after ſhe was Queen, did not
entirely drop the ambition of appearing as an author; and next to her deſire
of admiration for beauty, this ſeems to have been the chief object of her
vanity. She tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated Boethius of the Conſolation of Philoſophy; in
order, as ſhe pretended, to allay her grief for Henry the fourth's change of
religion. As far as we can judge from Elizabeth's compoſitions, we may
pronounce, that notwithſtanding her application, and her excellent parts, her
taſte in literature was very indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: She was much inferior to her
ſucceſſor in this particular, who was himſelf far from being a juſt
model of eloquence.</p>
               <p>UNHAPPILY for literature, at leaſt for the learned of this
age, the Queen's va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity lay more in ſhining by her own learning, than in
encouraging men of genius by her liberality. Spencer himſelf, the fineſt
Engliſh writer of his age, was long neglected; and after the death of Sir
Philip Sydney, his patron, was allowed to die almoſt for want. This poet
contains great beauties, a ſweet and harmonious verſification, eaſy
elocution, a fine imagination: Yet does the peruſal of his work become ſo
tedious, that one never finiſhes it from the mere pleaſure which it
affords: It ſoon becomes a kind of taſk-reading; and it requires ſome
eſſort and reſolution to carry us on to the end of his long performance.
This effect, of which every one is conſcious, is uſually aſcribed to the
change of manners: But manners have more changed ſince Homer's age; and yet
that poet remains ſtill the favourite of every reader of taſte and
judgment. Homer copied true natural manners, which, however rough or
uncultivated, will always form an agreeable and intereſting picture: But the
pencil of the Engliſh poet was employed <pb n="739" facs="tcp:0429000102:344"/> in drawing the
affectations, and conceits, and fopperies of chivalry, which appear ridiculous
as ſoon as they loſe the recommendation of the mode. The tediouſneſs of
continued allegory, and that too ſeldom ſtriking or ingenious, has alſo
contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to render the <hi>Fairy Queen</hi> peculiarly tireſome; not to
mention the too great frequency of its deſcriptions, and the langour of its
ſtanza. Upon the whole, Spencer maintains his place in the ſhelves among
our Engliſh claſſics: But he is ſeldom ſeen on the table; and
ſcarce any one, if he dares to be ingenuous, but will confeſs, that,
notwithſtanding all the merit of the poet, he affords an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment with
which the palate is ſoon ſatiated. Several writers of late have amuſed
themſelves with copying the ſtile of Spencer; and no imitation has been
ſo indifferent as not to bear a great reſemblance of the original: His
manner is ſo peculiar, that it is almoſt impoſſible not to transfer
ſome of it into the copy.</p>
