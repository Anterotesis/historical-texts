            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>And ſcans with timid glance your critic eyes;</l>
               <l>My client is a more experienc'd dame,</l>
               <l>Tho' not a Veteran, not unknown to Fame,</l>
               <l>Who think your favours are an honeſt boaſt,</l>

                     <speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes: but in very ill humour. I came to London early this morning with my family for the winter, and found my houſe, after going through only a ſlight repair, ſo damp, that I dare not ſleep in it: and ſo I am now ſending and going all over the town to ſeek for lodgings.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>
                     <p>Then ſeek no farther, but take up your lodgings here.</p>

                     <p>To be plain with you, I called in hopes you would aſk me; for I am ſo delicately ſcrupulous in reſpect to lady Priory, that I could not bear the thought of taking her to an hotel.</p>

                     <p>I am moſt extremely obliged to you <stage>very fervently</stage>; for into no one houſe belonging to any of my acquaintance would I take my wife, ſo ſoon as into yours. I have now been married eleven years, and during all that time I have made it a rule never to go on a viſit, ſo as to domeſticate, in the houſe of a married man.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
                     <p>It is becauſe I am married myſelf; and having always treated my wife according to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mode of treating wives, I would rather ſhe ſhould never be an eye-witneſs to the modern houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold management.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Wil.</speaker>
                     <p>The ancients, I believe, were very affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to their wives.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
                     <p>And they had reaſon to be ſo; for their wives obeyed them. The ancients ſeldom gave them the liberty to do wrong: but modern wives do as they like.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Nor.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Lord Pri.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, when it is what I like too. But never, never elſe.</p>

                     <p>That I am proud of.

—but that is rather of advantage to me as a huſband—it cauſes me to be obeyed without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation—no liberty for contention, tears, or repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I inſure conjugal ſunſhine, by now and then introducing a ſtorm; while ſome huſbands never ſee any thing but a cloudy ſky, and all for the want of a little domeſtic thunder to clear away the vapours.</p>

                     <p>What I have juſt learned from one of your ſervants. About a quarter of an hour after you left them, they ſtole ſoftly out at the back of your houſe, ran to a poſt-chaiſe and four that was in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drove off together full ſpeed.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Norberry will not give either his money or his word to releaſe you—But as I am rich—have loſt my only child—and wiſh to do ſome good with my fortune, I will inſtantly lay down the money of which you are in want, upon certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
