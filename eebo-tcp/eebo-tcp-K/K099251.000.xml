            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Nothing, I'll aſſure you Whitmore, would have brought me on this ſide the Atlantic, but my unconquerable paſſion for the adorable Louiſa Winſtone.</p>

                     <speaker>WHITMORE.</speaker>
                     <p>Miſs Winſtone, Sir, has been long the belle of this iſland, and has been the occaſion, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hear, of much envy among the ladies, and as much paſſion among the gentlemen. But could you obtain nothing more deſirable at home, that you muſt needs neglect an Albion flower for a poor drooping Antigua bloſſom?</p>

                     <speaker>LOVEMORE.</speaker>
                     <p>Don't diſhonour my Louiſa by any odious compariſon. Before ſhe left England ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the roſe in her cheeks, the rainbow in her forehead, lightning in her eyes, with grace, innocence and elegance in her whole frame.</p>

                     <p>Huſh, huſh, man; don't be over extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; I grant Miſs Winſtone might have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed all you ſay upon her firſt arrival here, but you do not know how ſoon every thing fades in this climate. For my own part, I cannot ſay much for her complexion.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LOVEMORE.</speaker>
                     <p>Her complexion Sir, I grant you, may be a little tanned, but I am ſure her features ever muſt remain beautiful. My dear Whitmore I am impatient to ſee her; conduct me therefore to her father's wherever it is.</p>

However Sir, not to baulk ſo paſſionate a lover, I'll mount you on the beſt ſteed I have, and follow you like a true 'Squire on the beſt mule or jack aſs on the whole eſtate. But pray, Sir, would you not chuſe a draught of punch after your hot ride from town? it is the cuſtom here always to have the bowl in readineſs. Here, Ceſar, Ceſar.</p>

                     <p>Why truly I am at a loſs to explain them; but they are upon the whole very ſtrange. As I journeyed through the different eſtates I heard as I thought nothing but the cracking and bouncing of fire works; but was very ſoon convinced that the noiſe proceeded from the ſmacks of the whips, and the correction which is daily and hourly inflicted on the ſlaves.</p>

                     <p>Why I was then Sir, but a minor, and though Miſs Winſtone favored my addreſſes, her father thought Jack Rattoon a better match for her, ſo brought her over to marry him againſt her conſent.</p>

For the value of a black dog, I will put him in pickle at once, and if poſſible make him more like the devil than ever; he loves his liberty however, though old Winſtone is in general a kind maſter, and feeds his houſe-negroes as well as himſelf: however if this feminine piece of buſineſs ſhould get to the ears of the women, what will they ſay? Let them ſay what they will, I do not care, ſo they do but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire me: faith the experiment will do well, if as it

                     <p>Why you ſee the ſenſation of pain, ariſing from hunger, is produced by the action of the two coats of the ſtomach acting upon each other; now the bandage confining the ſtomach, and preventing this action, of courſe takes away the pain. This therefore is one argument among many others to prove that digeſtion is performed by the action of the maſtication of the ſtomach, and not by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as ſome phyſicians erroneouſly ſuppoſed.</p>

                     <p>It is quite the reverſe with her; for ſhe did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but abuſe you I am told, and that you in fact run as much in her head, as ſhe did once in your heart.</p>

                     <p>So I ſhould think; and I wonder I never heard of it before. Old Winſtone is the laſt man whom I ſhould ſuppoſe a connoiſſeur; and ſo enlightened in natural hiſtory, that I am certain he would not know the ſhell of a turtle from that of a crab, if it was not that he generally had one or the other every day at his table.</p>

I am in hopes of ſeeing his beautiful daughter, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether her face is grown any browner than it was; indeed I am not ſorry for it; for the ſun which tanned her complexion has turned the beſt ſpirits of her diſpoſition to vinegar.

                     <p>Oh! Sir, quite the reverſe. I have been juſt telling him you were one of the greateſt philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of the age; and theſe figures convince me of it, for they are very fine, very fine indeed.</p>

                     <p>I obſerve Sir, however, that there is a degree of ſtrength in the lines of the face, and though the figure repreſents a perſon aſleep, it is like one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the painful preſſure and influence of the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>WINSTONE.</speaker>
                     <p>O God! Sir, no. He haunted my conſcience for ever after; he appeared at night by my bed ſide, and in ſhort troubled me ſo much, that in order to appeaſe the fellow's ghoſt I erected this to his honour.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>WHITMORE.</speaker>
                     <p>He was a revengeful fellow, though a damn'd good cooper, and came from Guinea. I knew him well.</p>

                     <speaker>WINSTONE.</speaker>
                     <p>Now the ghoſt of another country ſlave would not have troubled me, but have lain quiet enough.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>LOVEMORE.</speaker>
                     <p>Heaven I ſee has revenged the old man's ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and for a ſlave killed has returned him a daughter burned; for a black loſt, a mulatto gained.</p>

                     <speaker>WINSTONE.</speaker>
                     <p>There was nothing for it but that; the group of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0057603200:62"/>
other figures you ſee, are pieces done from fancy, white, black, and yellow; but that which takes up Mr. Lovemore's attention is the principal one.</p>

                     <p>Would you be ſo obliging as to permit me to touch this wax, for upon my ſoul the artificial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million of the lips looks ſo much like real, balmy, benign true blood, that I am almoſt tempted to kiſs them.

                  <stage>Starting back as he goes to touch it, Miſs Winſtone overſets the pedeſtal, and falls back into the attitude of a fencer, with her fan in her right hand; Mr. Lovemore, after expreſſing much ſurprize, claſps his hands in rapture, the other gentlemen ſeem much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and make a pauſe; old Winſtone reſting his chin upon a cudgel.</stage>

gloried in the affections of Mr. Lovemore; and though I was by the commands of my father torn from his vows to a country where I were often, and conſtantly made me yet out of compaſſion for him I refuſed both my hand and heart to thoſe that requeſted them: ſuch were once my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards you; but now inſulted, rejected, what ſhall I ſay to your importunities?</p>
