            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

         <div n="1" type="letter">
            <head>LETTER I.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>EVER did Monarch come to the throne of England with a greater
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of favourable concurrences than Charles I. He found himſelf
poſſeſſed of a peaceful and flouriſhing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his right
undiſputed by any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val claimant, ſtrengthened by an alliance with one of
the moſt powerful Monarchs that ever reigned in France, whoſe ſiſter he
had married; and, to add to all this, he was loved by his ſubjects, whom he
had won by his virtues and addreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0443100202:5"/> But this was but a flattering proſpect; the
ſpirit of liberty was rouzed, and was reſolved to oppoſe the ancient
claims of Monarchs, who uſurped their power in times of ignorance or danger,
confirmed it by laws, and continued it by long preſcription. Charles had
been, from his infancy, taught to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the royal privileges as ſacred
pledges, which it was his duty to defend: his father had implanted the
doctrines of hereditary and indefeaſible right early upon his mind. James
only defended thoſe doctrines by words, and it was ſoon the fate of Charles
to aſſert them by action. It is the duty of every So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign to conſider
the genius and diſpoſition of his people, as a father does that of his
children, and to adapt his government to each conjuncture. Charles miſtook
that genius; he wanted to govern a people who had, for ſome time, learned to
be free by maxims and precedents, that had their origin in times of ignorance
and ſlavery.</p>
            <p>He therefore began his reign with two of the moſt difficult
projects that could be conceived; the one to ſuccour the Proteſtants in
Germany againſt the Emperor and Duke of Bavaria; the other to keep the royal
prerogatives entire, without a national ſtanding army. In order to effect
theſe purpoſes, the houſe of commons was to be managed, who, as I have
already deſcribed, from being the oppreſſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were now willing, in
turn, to become oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; who, from a deteſtation of Popery, had now
overſhot the mark, and were become Puritans. His firſt demand for the
neceſſary ſupplies to carry on the war of the Palatinate in Germany,
though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken at their own requeſt, was anſwered with a petition for
puniſhing Papiſts, and for an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the grievances of the
nation. Buckingham, who had been the late King's favourite, and who was ſtill
more careſſed by the preſent Monarch, did not eſcape their cenſures:
inſtead of granting the <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0443100202:6"/> ſums requiſite, they employed
the time in vain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations and complaints, till the ſeaſon for
proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the intended campaign was elapſed. The King, therefore, at
length wearied with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and offended at their contempt of his
demands, thought proper to diſſolve a parliament which he could not bring
to reaſon. In fact, the commons, at this time, complained of imaginary
grievances, but the time was approaching when their complaints were to become
real.</p>
            <p>The miniſters of the King had not yet forgot that kind of tax
which was called a benevolence, and which had been often exacted from the
ſubject in former reigns. Charles thought to avail himſelf of this method
of procuring money, but at the ſame time coloured it over with a greater
appearance of juſtice than any of his predeceſſors. He therefore
determined to borrow money of ſuch perſons as were beſt able to lend, to
whom, for this purpoſe, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected letters, mentioning the ſum. With this
the people reluctantly complied; it was, in fact, a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, though
authoriſed by a thouſand precedents; but no precedent can give ſanction
to injuſtice. With this money a fleet was equipped and ſent againſt
Spain, but which returned without procuring either glory or advantage.</p>
            <p>This ineffectual expedition demanded to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by a new
ſupply greater than what extorted loans could produce, and another parliament
was called for this purpoſe. The new parliament, upon this occaſion,
ſeemed even more refractory than the former, and appeared more willing to
make or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of grievances than to grant money: but chiefly their
reſentment was directed againſt Buckingham, the royal favourite. Whenever
the ſubjects attack the royal prerogative, they begin with the favourites of
the crown; and wiſe Princes, ſenſible of this, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom have any.
Charles was not poſſeſſed of the <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0443100202:7"/> art of making a
diſtinction between friends and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; whoever was his favourite him
he always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the adminiſtration of affairs; he loved
Buckingham, and undertook to defend him: to defend this nobleman was to ſhare
his reproach; two mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the houſe of commons, Diggs and Elliot,
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to accuſe him. The purport of the charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to little more
than that he had engroſſed too much power for himſelf and his relations,
and that he had applied a plaiſter to the late King's ſide which was
ſuppoſed to be poiſonous. They inveighed againſt the Duke from this
frivolous accuſation, and the King, in a paſſion, ordered them both to
the Tower. This was an open act of violence, and ſhould have been
ſupported, or ever performed. The commons exclaimed, that their privileges
were infringed; they proteſted that neither of the members had ſpoken any
thing diſreſpectful of his Majeſty, and began to publiſh their
vindication. The King, who was ever ready to enter upon harſh meaſures, but
not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, releaſed the two members, and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
confirmed that obſtinacy which his former injury had contributed to raiſe.
The Earl of Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, for being guilty of the ſame offence in the houſe of
Lords, was impriſoned and diſmiſſed in the ſame manner by the King.
The two houſes having in this manner anſwered the royal demands for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
the King, rather than give up the Duke, choſe to be without the ſupply, and
therefore once more diſſolved the parliament.</p>
            <p>He had now a war to maintain, which he was engaged in by the advice
of thoſe very members who refuſed to contribute to its ſupport; beſides
this, he was to put the kingdom in a proper poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and he
wanted money to execute theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. To furniſh the proper ſupplies
he again had recourſe to loans, and to granting protections to the Papiſts,
for ſtipulated ſums of money: ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0443100202:8"/> had
ſoldiers billetted upon them, contrary to the cuſtoms of England; and even
ſome were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled for ſoldiers themſelves. Perſons of birth and rank
were ſummoned to appear before the council, and, upon their perſiſting in
a refuſal, were put into confinement. We now once more perceive the ſeeds
of diſcord beginning to ſhoot forth: we now ſee, as in every other civil
war, both parties guilty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, yet on either ſide that injuſtice
ariſing from principles of virtue; the one actuated by the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
liberties of mankind, the other by the preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive privileges of the crown:
ſuch is the general lot of humanity, to have their actions degenerate from
the producing motives.</p>
            <p>The King, now finding that nothing but the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of immediate
danger could induce ſome future parliament to provide neceſſary
ſupplies, was reſolved to make a rupture with France, a war againſt which
had ever been an expedient of producing unanimity at home. With this view he
ſent out Buckingham with a fleet to relieve Rochelle, a maritime town in that
kingdom, which had long enjoyed its privileges independent of the French King,
and which he was now actually preparing to deprive them of. This expedition was
equally fruitleſs with that to the coaſts of Spain; the Duke knew nothing
of the art of war, and conſumed his time in beſieging a little fort in the
iſle of Rhee, from whence he was driven with the loſs of half his army. The
bad ſucceſs of this ſerved to render the unfortunate Duke ſtill more
obnoxious, and the King more needy; another parliament was therefore called,
and a ſupply demanded in the uſual form. The commons, in the firſt
parliament, had begun with fictitious grievances, but their refuſing then to
contribute the ſupplies ſoon introduced an actual abuſe of power, and
rendered the King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, who, probably, only deſired to be eaſy. He
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted ſupplies, and impriſoned the refractory. The <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0443100202:9"/>
complaints of the commons were now real; their members had been impriſoned,
loans had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted; a tax upon merchandize, called tonnage and poundage,
had been exacted without parliamentary authority; and, laſt of all, the Duke
of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was ſtill ſuffered to rule the councils of the King, and
inflame every proceeding. In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ſeemed, as uſual,
reſolved to grant no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney till their grievances were redreſſed, and
till the King had given a poſitive aſſurance to maintain the liberties of
the ſubject. The King promiſed both, and they voted him a liberal ſupply,
upon which they were prorogued, as was cuſtomary. This freſh ſupply
enabled his Majeſty to make another attempt to relieve Rochelle, and the Duke
of Buckingham was again to have the command: Buckingham had ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with
ſome haughtineſs, as being ſecure of the King's protection; but his
greateſt fault ſeemed to be too large a ſhare of power, which gave
offence to every order. It is the aim of all malecontents in a ſtate rather
to bring the great down to their own level, than to exalt the inferior order to
theirs: and this might be a motive to the lords and commons for attempting to
retrench Buckingham's power. The clamour raiſed againſt him in the houſe
was not loſt among the people; they re-echoed it from one to the other, and
the Duke had a million of foes only from his ſeeming proſperity. Among this
number was one John Felton, an Iriſhman, a lieutenant in the army; this man
was naturally melancholy, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous, and enthuſiaſtic; he felt for his
country as if labouring under a calamity which he thought it in the power of
his ſingle arm to remove: he reſolved to kill the Duke, and thus to do a
ſervice both to God and man. Animated with miſtaken patriotiſm and gloomy
zeal, he reached Portſmouth, where the Duke was then, ſurrounded with his
levee, giving the neceſſary orders to embark. Felton came up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0443100202:10"/> the crowd and ſtabbed him with a long knife to the heart;
the Duke inſtantly fell dead, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton walked compoſedly away; but his
hat had fallen off while he was ſtriking the blow, and this produced his
diſcovery. He diſdained denying a murder in which he gloried, and averred
that he looked upon the Duke as an enemy to his country, and, as ſuch,
deſerving to ſuffer. We ſhall ſee through the courſe of this reign
ſeveral inſtances of great virtues and enormous vices, for the genius of
England was at this time arrived at its higheſt pitch.</p>
            <p>The expedition to Rochelle again returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs, as
if it had been ordered by fate that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to put the people into good
humour. The conteſt therefore between privilege and prerogative was now
carried on with the ſame acrimony as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Tonnage and poundage was
exacted by the King as a right belonging to the crown, and refuſed by the
merchants as a tax that could only be granted by the people. The parliament was
called to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the diſpute, but, inſtead of diſcuſſing that
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, they entered upon diſputes about religion. The houſe was
moſtly compoſed of Puritans, and ſuch were for aboliſhing Epiſcopacy,
and perſecuting Papiſts. They were freed from Buckingham; but there was
another favourite whom they dreaded ſtill more, Laud Archbiſhop of
Canterbury, a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the opinion of <hi>Divine right,</hi> and
firmly attached to the rites of the church as then eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They
ſeemed willing to allow the King no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, and therefore loudly murmured
againſt this Biſhop. Their indignation, however, was, for a while, called
off to another object, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a new act of violence in the
King. His cuſtomhouſe officers had ſeized upon the goods of one or two
merchants who refuſed to pay tonnage and poundage. The Judges, in the former
reign of James I, had adjudged this tax to belong to the <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0443100202:11"/>
crown without conſent of parliament. The former reign therefore had been the
proper time for diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's right, but the commons had then not
ſo much power, or ſuch a ſpirit of reſiſtance as now. They were now
perfectly ſenſible of their own ſtrength, and were reſolved to fix the
limits between the King and the people. They therefore boldly and warmly
remonſtrated againſt the King's proceeding; and he in return impriſoned
four of the members, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the parliament. Theſe were the
cauſes which ſoon after overturned the ſtate, and laid the throne in
blood.</p>

            <p>AMonarchical government has ever been looked upon as beſt, when
wiſely adminiſtered. We are ſo conſtituted by nature that ſome are
born to command, and others to obey. In a republic, how free ſoever, the
people cannot govern themſelves, and their leaders muſt be tyrants over
their own narrow circle of ſubjects. In a monarchy the Governor is placed at
a diſtance from the many, as he is but one; in a republic the tyrants are
near, becauſe they are many. In the former the people are ſubject to
oppreſſion from errors of will; in the latter, to be harraſſed by the
rigours of the law: in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy the redreſs of grievances is ſpeedy; in
a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, dilatory and uncertain: in the one, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are few; in the
other, ſevere and numerous, from the debility of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The preſent parliament, ſeemed not ſo intent upon abridging
the King's power, as upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aboliſhing it; they were Calviniſts,
and it is <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0443100202:12"/> the ſpirit of Calviniſm to throw off the
reſtraints of royalty. The Engliſh had lately ſeen this happily effected
in Switzerland and Holland, and, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by ſuch examples, ſeemed
deſirous of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen the King and the Engliſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now almoſt
prepared for an open rupture; ſtill, however, the commons kept within the
bounds of humble remonſtrance, and, while they refuſed his Majeſty's
demands, aſked pardon for their delay. They had ſtill a reſpect for their
Monarch, which even their republican principles could not entirely efface; and,
though they were willing to wound, yet they feared to ſtrike an open blow.
The Scotch ſoon ſet them an example of reſiſtance; they had, in that
kingdom, long embraced the Calviniſtical doctrines; and, though they ſtill
had Biſhops, theſe were reduced to poverty, and treated with contempt.
James I. attempted to exalt the Biſhops, and to introduce the rites and the
liturgy of the church of England among them, but died in the midſt of his
endeavours. Charles, therefore, was reſolved to complete what his father had
begun. This unneceſſary and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged attempt alienated the affections of
his Scotoh ſubjects. The ſedition paſt from city to city; the
Calviniſts formed a league, as if all the laws, divine and human, were
infringed; while the deſire in the court party of ſupporting their
commands, and, in the people, of defending their religion, ſoon, excited,
actually, in Scotland, thoſe dangers which in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were, as yet, only
apprehended.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a ſituation the King could only repreſs the
preſumption of his Scotch ſubjects by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe of
England; but he had lately diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his parliament, and ſeemed no way
diſpoſed to call another; he had cut off the ſources of every ſupply in
caſes of emergency, and fondly hoped he <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0443100202:13"/> could govern by
merely the terror of royalty. His favourites helped to confirm his errors; they
were fond of arbitrary power, becauſe they ſhared its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences; the
privy council conſidered itſelf as abſolute; the Star-Chamber, as it was
called, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed all who denied the prerogative royal; the High
Commiſſion court now turned from defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Papiſts againſt the
Puritans, whom they juſtly feared, as tinctured with the ſpirit of
reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The very Judges alſo, being choſen by the court, were
entirely devoted to the King; ſo that all conſpired to lift him above
juſtice, and induced him to call parliaments no more, whoſe maxims of
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment he found diametrically oppoſite to his own.</p>
            <p>He was therefore reſolved to fix upon other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of raiſing
money: methods indeed which were practiſed by his predeceſſors, but at
times when they had power to controll even juſtice, and force to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
their ſubjects to obey. Charles, in the midſt of a civil war in Scotland,
and the diſcontents of his people at home, at a time when one half of his
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were preaching ſedition, and the other half were learning to
deſpiſe Kings; without army, and without treaſures; reſolved to reign
with arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>With the taxes which he levied without parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in England, he
undertook to bring about the reformation in Scotland; and therefore began, as
his parliament was now no more, to collect a tax upon the ſubject called
<hi>Ship-money.</hi> This is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tax which firſt rouzed a whole
nation, after an unſettled conſtitution of more than a thouſand years, at
length to fix and determine the bounds of their own freedom, and the King's
prerogative.</p>
            <p>To give a ſanction to the royal orders, this tax was backed by the
opinion of all the Judges, who voted it to be cuſtomary and legal. Their
opinion <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0443100202:14"/> will, at once, ſerve to explain the nature of
this tax, and what they judged concerning it. It ran thus, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>We, every man by himſelf, and all of us
together, have taken into ſerious conſideration the caſe and queſtion
concerning Ship-money; and it is our opinion, that when the good and ſafety
of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the Kingdom in danger, that your
Majeſty may, by writ under the great ſeal of England, command all your
ſubjects of this your kingdom, at their charge, to provide and furniſh
ſuch number of ſhips with men, victuals, and ammunition, and for ſuch
time as your Majeſty ſhall think fit, for the defence and ſafety of this
Kingdom from ſuch danger and peril: And that, by law, your Majeſty may
compel the doing thereof, in caſe of refuſal or refractorineſs: And we
are alſo of opinion, that in ſuch caſe your Majeſty is the ſole judge
both of the danger, and when and how the ſame is to he prevented and avoided,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>An order from the throne, thus backed by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all the
Judges, it was thought, would be, at once, complied with; but the King was
deceived. A private man, of courage and integrity, one John Hampden, ſtood
forth as a champion for the people, and refuſed to pay a tax not authorized
by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſum at which he was rated amounted to but twenty
ſhillings, yet he refuſed to contribute even this, and brought his cauſe
before the court of Exchequer. Never was a greater cauſe argued in any court
before. The Judges, by their ſentence, were to determine whether the nation,
and their poſterity, were to be ſubject to arbitrary power, or to enjoy
freedom. The Judges determined in favour of ſervitude; Hampden was caſt;
and this only ſerved to increaſe the diſcontents of the people.</p>
            <p>The diſcontent and oppoſition the King found among his Engliſh
ſubjects, one would have thought, might ſerve to repreſs his ardour for
reformation in the religion of Scotland. Having publiſhed an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0443100202:15"/> for reading the liturgy in the principal church in
Edinburgh, the people received it with clamours and imprecations; the
court-party blamed their obſtinacy, as the innovations were trifling; but
this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted againſt themſelves with ſtill greater force, for
labouring ſo earneſtly at the eſtabliſhment of trifles. The ſedition
in that kingdom, which had hitherto been ſecret, was now kept concealed no
longer; rebellion had, as it were, ſet up its ſtandard amongſt them. Yet
ſtill the King could not reſolve to deſiſt from his deſign; and ſo
prepoſſeſſed was he in favour of royal right, that he thought the very
name of a King would influence them to return to duty. He was ſoon
undeceived; the Scotch Calviniſts, whoſe principles were republican,
entered into a covenant to ſuppreſs the Biſhops, and reſiſt the
King's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This was judged an open declaration of war, and Charles
ſummoned the Nobility of England, who held lands of the crown, to furniſh a
proper number of forces to ſuppreſs them. To add to his ſupplies, he
demanded a voluntary contribution from the Clergy, and by means of his Queen
the Catholics alſo were preſſed for their aſſiſtance. By theſe
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods he found himſelf at the head of an undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined and reluctant
army, amounting to about twenty thouſand men, commanded by Generals more
willing to negotiate than to fight. However, his ſuperiority of number gave
him a manifeſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the malecontents, who were not ſlow in
marching to oppoſe him. Charles had inherited the peaceful diſpoſition of
his father; he was unwilling to come to extremities, although a blow, then
ſtruck with vigour, might have prevented many of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
misfortunes. Inſtead of fighting, he entered upon a treaty; a
ſuſpenſion was concluded upon, and terms agreed to, that neither ſide
intended to preſerve. This ſuſpenſion, and diſbanding the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0443100202:16"/> was a fatal ſtep to the King; the Scotch forces could be
again muſtered at pleaſure; the Engliſh troops, not without time,
difficulty, and expence. Of this the malecontents were ſenſible, and the
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations met with obſtructions in proportion as they were confident of
their power. In ſhort, after much altercation, and many treaties ſigned,
and broken, both parties once more reſolved upon a war.</p>
            <p>War being reſolved on, the King now took every method to raiſe
money for maintaining it. <hi>Ship-money</hi> was levied as before; ſome
other arbitrary taxes were exacted with great ſeverity; but one method of
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſupplies reflects immortal honour upon thoſe who granted
them. His counſellors and ſervants lent the King whatever ſums they could
ſpare, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed their private fortunes to ſerve the ſtate.
Laud, Archbiſhop of Canterbury, and the Marquis of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, contributed
very large ſums; but particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, gave
his Majeſty twenty thouſand pounds. Wentworth was one of thoſe great
characters which marked thoſe celebrated times. Upon his firſt appearance
in the ſtate he was foremoſt in the oppoſition to the crown; but, finding
his confederates had mixed a ſpirit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm with their regards for
liberty, he left their ſide to take that of the King, which he fancied in
greateſt danger. He was brave, wiſe, and loyal, and followed the King from
principle, yet without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely approving his conduct.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the reſources of the crown to prepare for a Scotch
war, but they were ſtill inſufficient; and there was but one method more to
furniſh larger ſupplies, namely, by calling a parliament. It was now eleven
years ſince Charles had called any. The ungovernable ſpirit of the laſt
had taught him to hate and to fear ſuch an aſſembly. His wants, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
at length, induced him to conſtrain his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0443100202:17"/>
and, by the advice of his Council, he called another, the members of which were
ſtill more tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent than the former, as they now had ſtill ſtronger
reaſons for their diſcontent. The houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons could not be induced
to treat the Scotch, who were of the ſame principles, and contended for the
ſame cauſe, as their enemies. They looked upon them as friends and
brothers, who only roſe to teach them how to defend their privileges. The
King could reap no other fruits, therefore, from this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, but
murmurings and complaints; every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he had taken to ſupply himſelf
with money was declared an abuſe. Tonnage and poundage, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, the
ſale of monopolies, the billetting ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers upon the citizens were all
voted ſtretches at ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power. The Star-chamber gave particular
offence, and inſtead of ſubſidies the houſe preſented the King with
nothing but their grievances. Charles once more diſſolved this parliament,
and thus aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated the diſcontents of the people.</p>
            <p>He had now made enemies of the Scotch nation, and of the commons of
England; it remained to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the city of London; upon their refuſing to
lend him a ſum of money to carry on the war, he ſued them in the
Star-chamber for ſome lands in Ireland, and made them pay a conſiderable
fine. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to exact all the taxes againſt which the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had
ſo frequently remonſtrated; even had he been deſpotic, ſuch a conduct
would have ſhook him on the throne; but, limited as he was, it ſerved to
complete his overthrow. He could expect little aſſiſtance from England;
and the Scotch, ſenſible of their own influence in that part of his
dominions, led an army of twenty thouſand men as far as New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle upon
Tyne, in order to ſeize upon, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him. Having thus prepared his
misfortunes, he found himſelf again obliged to call the laſt parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which completed his ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0443100202:18"/> Inſtead of granting money, this new
parliament, as all the reſt had done, began by demanding to have their
grievances redreſſed; they deſired an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the Star chamber;
exclaimed againſt arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary taxes, and particularly ſhip-money; and, in
fine, demanded that a new parliament ſhould be called every three years.
Charles was now obliged to grant thoſe demands from neceſſity, which in
the beginning of his reign he might have beſtowed as a favour. He expected to
regain his authority by complying, but he was deceived; nothing could ſatisfy
the commons but the total abolition of his power. He expected that his
Engliſh ſubjects would repreſs the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of thoſe of Scotland,
but had the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find the houſe of commons approve their
conduct, and repay their irruption with a reward of three hundred thouſand
pounds. He hoped to repreſs the Puritanical party in England, but found, to
his ſurprize, almoſt the whole houſe of commons of that perſuaſion.
He loved the Earl of Strafford with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and eſteemed his wiſdom;
and the houſe of commons, conſcious of his regards, accuſed the Earl of
high treaſon. When we attempt innovation, we ſeldom know how far our
ſchemes will extend at laſt. This parliament began with redreſſing
grievances; they proceeded to reform the ſtate, and ended in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
deſtroying the conſtitution.</p>

            <p>IN treating of a ſubject, in which almoſt every Engliſhman is
partial, it is no eaſy matter to avoid falling into their errors; but, I have
labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to view this part of our hiſtory, without receiving any biaſs
from party; and our conſtitution is now ſufficiently eſtabliſhed,
whatever we may think of this Monarch's equity, or his ſubjects reſolution.
Our laws, at preſent, differ both from what Charles endeavoured to maintain,
and what his parliaments pretended to enact: we now are all agreed, that the
unlimited power arrogated on one ſide, and the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous freedom introduced
on the other, are both intolerable; yet, of the two, perhaps, deſpotiſm is
ſuperior. In a republic, the tyrant is in our village, in our family;
perhaps, in a monarchy, he lives at a diſtance: the oppreſſions of a
Monarch are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally exerted only in the narrow ſphere round him; the
oppreſſions of the governors of a republic, though not ſo flagrant, are
more univerſal: the Monarch is apt to commit great enormities, but they
ſeldom reach the multitude at humble diſtance from the throne; the
republican Deſpot oppreſſes the multitude that lies within the circle of
his influence: the Monarch terrifies me with great evils which I may never
feel; the Deſpot actually loads me with ſubmiſſions, which I am
conſtantly obliged to ſuſtain; and, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it is much better to
be in danger of having my head chopped off, with an ax, once in my life, than
to have my leg gauled with a continual fetter.</p>
            <p>Whatever were the reaſonings of the King, upon this ſubject, it
is certain, his actions were intended for the benefit of his ſubjects; but he
continued to rule them, upon the maxims of former princes, at a time that the
principles of the ſubjects were totally changed. The houſe of commons
ſeemed now to have thrown off all ſubordination; they not only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0443100202:20"/> and attained almoſt all the King's mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
particularly Laud, Strafford, Finch, and Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck; but paſſed an act to
make that parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, until all grievances ſhould be
redreſſed. The King complied with every meaſure, yet all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
only ſerved to increaſe their demands. The Earl of Strafford firſt fell a
victim to their popular fury: the commons exhibited an accurſation, of
twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-eight articles againſt him; the ſubſtance of which was, That he
had attempted to extend the King's authority at home, and had been guilty of
ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in Ireland. Theſe received the name of high treaſon,
and the people without demanded juſtice. The managers for the houſe of
commons pleaded, with vehemence, againſt him at the bar of the houſe of
Lords, who were his Judges: they inſiſted, that, though each article
ſeperately did not amount to a proof, yet, the whole taken together carried
convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is a method of arguing frequently uſed in the Engliſh
courts of juſtice, even to this day; and, perhaps, none can be more
erroneous; for almoſt every falſhood may thus be defended by a
multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of weak reaſons. In this tumult of aggravation and clamour, the
Earl himſelf, whoſe parts and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had long been reſpected and
acknolwedged, ſtood unmoved. He defended his innocence with all the
preſence of mind, judgment, and temper, that could be expected from innocence
and ability. His little children were placed near him, as he was thus
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending his own cauſe, and that of his maſter: after he had, with a long
and eloquent ſpeech, delivered extempore, confuted the accuſation of his
enemies, he thus drew to a concluſion, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>But, my Lords, I have troubled you too long;
longer than I ſhould have done, but, for the ſake of thoſe dear pledges,
a ſaint, in heaven, has left me.—</hi>
               </q>Upon this he pauſed,
dropped a tear, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his children, and then proceeded.—What I 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0443100202:21"/> forfeit, for myſelf, is a trifle; that my
indiſcretions ſhould reach my poſterity, wounds me to the heart. Pardon
my infirmity.—Something I ſhould have added, but am not able;
therefore, let it paſs. And now, my Lords, for myſelf, I have long been
taught, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>that the affictions of this life are overpaid by
that eternal weight of glory, which awaits the innocent; and ſo, my Lords,
even ſo, with the utmoſt tranquility I ſubmit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to your judgment.
Whether that judgment be life, or death.</hi> TE DEUM LAUDAMUS.</q> His
eloquence and innocence ſeemed to influence his Judges: the King himſelf
went to the houſe of Lords, and ſpoke in his defence; but the ſpirit of
the people was excited, and nothing, but his blood, would give them
ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. He was condemned by both houſes, and nothing now remained,
but for the King to give his conſent to the bill of attainder. But his
conſent ſeemed of little conſequence; the limits of royalty were long
ſince broken down, and imminent dangers might attend his refuſal. While he
continued in this agitation of mind, not knowing how to behave, he received a
letter from the unfortunate Nobleman himſelf, deſiring that his life might
be made the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a mutual agreement between the King and the people;
adding, that to a willing mind there could be no injury. This noble inſtance
of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity was but ill repaid; the King was perſuaded to give his
conſent; he ſigned the fatal bill; Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was beheaded; and this taught
his ſubjects ſoon after to ſpill blood that was ſtill more
precious.</p>
            <p>The whole kingdom now ſeemed to be in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all the
petitions of parliament, which were in reality calculated to abaſe the King,
were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding drawn up with the moſt ſeeming affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
obedience; they were conſtantly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in each of theſe of their
fears for the church, at the very time that they were themſelves labouring
its overthrow. Faction ran high. In the King's party <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0443100202:22"/> there
was an ill-projected and worſe conducted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of keeping the prerogative
as much untouched as ever it had been in the reigns of the moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and formidable Monarchs; in the oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a fixed reſolution of
turning the ſtate into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, and changing the government, of the
church into that of preſbytery.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe troubles, the Papiſts of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
fancied they found a convenient opportunity of throwing off the Engliſh yoke.
Religion and liberty often inſpire the moſt attrocious actions; and they
did ſo now. The Papiſts took a reſolution, of which we find many horrid
examples in hiſtory. They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to cut off all the Proteſtants in that
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at one blow. Not leſs than forty thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fell a
ſacrifice upon this occaſion. In ſuch a number of murders cruelty put on
a thouſand differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhapes; rapes, burnings, and tortures were
prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in every part of that miſerable iſland; and all the
Proteſtants periſhed who had not the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to make early
proviſion for their ſafety. Such was the ſtate of Ireland then, and
ſuch was England ſhortly to be. The parliament took this opportunity to
blacken the King, as if he had given ſanction to the Papiſts, and
encouraged their barbarous deſign; he vindicated himſelf with a zeal that
nothing but innocence could inſpire; and tried every method of
aſſiſting his Proteſtant ſubjects of Ireland. He even demanded
ſuccours from the parliament of Scotland to relieve the Iriſh
Proteſtants; but they remitted him to the parliament of England, as Ireland
lay more immediately under their protection. The Engliſh houſe of commons
ſent but feeble ſuccours to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they pretended to deplore, and gave
it as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that the government at home was in danger.</p>
            <p>They now proceeded to what they long laboured at, to eſtabliſh a
republic, and deſtroy the rites of the <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0443100202:23"/> church of
England. They ſignified to the King, that it was fit to have a privy council
only of their appointing. Three members of the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preſented
this requeſt on their knees. The King was pleaſed to grant all. Oliver
Cromwell, who was then in the houſe of commons, was heard to declare, that,
if this requeſt was rejected, he would ſell his eſtate, which was then
but ſmall, and retire out of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, it is probable, both ſides were actuated rather by
principle than ambition. The Biſhops had hitherto adhered cloſely to the
King; they were not only expelled the houſe of Lords, but, upon
remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating againſt this unconſtitutional meaſure, were accuſed by
the houſe of commons of high treaſon, and ten of them ſent to the Tower.
This ſpirit of epidemic rage was not confined to both houſes of parliament
alone; the populace daily ſurrounded the place of ſitting, and, with
tumultuous cries, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſtice. The apprentices, the common-council, and
the citizens of London were foremoſt in this ſtruggle for liberty, as they
thought it; their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were ſincere; for the motives of a mob, though
often wrong, are always honeſt. In this conteſt the Preſbyterians, and
Cardinal Richelieu of France, were ever intriguing; both deſired a civil war,
the one willing to depreſs the great, the other to humble the kingdom.</p>
            <p>In this decline of the royal authority, the King was perſuaded to
take a ſtep which was fatal to his intereſts. By the advice of Lord Digby,
one of his miniſters, he went himſelf to the houſe of commons, and
accuſed five of its members of high treaſon. Theſe were the leading
members of the houſe, whom he thus ventured to call in queſtion; namely,
Lord Kimbolton, Mr. Hollis, Sir Arthur Haſlerig, Mr. Pym, Mr. Hampden, and
Mr. Strode. He ſat, for ſome time, in the ſpeaker's chair, to ſee if
the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0443100202:24"/> were preſent; but they had eſcaped a
few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes before his entry; and the houſe of commons was reſolved to
ſupport the cauſe. Diſappointed, perplexed, unknowing whom to rely on,
the King went next to the common-council of the city, and made his complaint to
them; the common-council only anſwered by aggravating his former
miſconduct. From thence he went to Windſor, where, reflecting upon the
raſhneſs of his former proceeding, he wrote to the parliament, informing
them, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>that he deſiſted from his proceedings
aginſt the accuſed members, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the parliament, that upon all
occaſions he would be as careful of their privileges as of his life or his
crown.</hi>
               </q> His violence (as a fine writer remarks) had firſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him hateful to his common,s and his ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion now contemptible.</p>
            <p>The commons had already ſtripped the King of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all his
privileges; the power of appointing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, generals, and levying armies,
ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They therefore proceeded to petition, that the Tower might
be put into their hands; that Hull, Portſmouth, and the fleet, ſhould be
commanded by perſons of their chuſing. Theſe requeſts were, at firſt,
conteſted, and then complied with; at laſt the commons deſired to have a
militia raiſed, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by ſuch officers and commanders as they
ſhould nominate, under a pretext of ſecuring them from the Iriſh
Papiſts, whom they affected to be in dread of. This was depriving the King of
even the ſhadow of his former power; but they had gone too far now to recede,
and feared leaving him any power, as knowing themſelves the firſt objects
on which its vengeance might be exerciſed. He was willing to grant the
raiſing a militia, but inſiſted upon giving it commanders; the parliament
deſired to command it for an appointed time; but the King, at laſt
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to reſentment, cried, they ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>no not for an hour.</hi>
               </q> This peremptory
refuſal <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0443100202:25"/> broke off all further treaty, and both ſides
were now to have recourſe to arms.</p>
            <p>Charles retired to York, and the Queen went over to Holland, to
raiſe money upon the crown jewels, and provide ammunition and forces. The
parliament, in the mean time, were not idle; they knew their ſtrength and
popularity, and publiſhed propoſals for bringing in money or plate for the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the kingdom. But, though each ſide were prepared for war, yet
they took every precaution to lay the blame of the firſt infraction of peace
on each other. The King offered propoſals to the commons which he knew they
would not accept; and they, in return, offered him nineteen propoſitions,
which, if complied with, would render him entirely ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to their
commands. Their import was, that the privy council, the principal officers of
ſtate, the governors of the King's children, forts, caſtles, fleet, armies,
ſhould be all appointed or governed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; that Papiſts ſhould

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0443100202:26"/> or
zeal. The parliament was convinced that it drew the ſword in defence of
liberty; and the King was equally ſtedfaſt in believing, that he had the
authority of Heaven for oppoſing their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. They therefore took
the field with little conduct; and courage alone in the troops generally
decided the fortune of the day.</p>
            <p>The parliament, from its own authority, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Sir John
Hotham, a ſitting member of the houſe of commons, governor of Hull. In this
city there was a large magazine of arms, ammunition, and proviſions. The
King, ſenſible of the importance of the place, was deſirous of ſecuring
it for himſelf; he therefore approached the gates with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
horſe, and demanded entrance. Hotham ſtill preſerved ſome appearance of
reſpect to his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, land, on his knees, refuſed to admit him.
Diſloyalty is ever timid in the beginning.</p>
            <p>Manifeſtoes, on one ſide and the other, were now diſperſed
through the whole kingdom, and the people were univerſally divided into two
factions, that went by the names of Royaliſts and Round-heads. The King
ordered the Nobility to attend his perſon; he procured the great ſeal from
London, and erected his ſtandard at Nottingham. The people, in general,
ſeemed to have loſt all reſpect to his perſon and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the laws
promulgated by parliament, without the ſanction of the great ſeal, were
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with due obedience; and the royal ſtandard was ſcarce followed
by any except a few militia. At length, however, with the ſuccours
furniſhed by his Queen, and the preſents of the univerſity of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
and his Clergy, he raiſed an army of about fourteen thouſand men, commanded
by Prince Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, a man of courage and ſome experience. The parliament,
which diſpoſed of the money of the nation, had one ſtill more numerous,
commanded <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0443100202:27"/> by the Earl of Eſſex, who fought from
principle, and who only wiſhed to bring the King to reaſon.</p>
            <p>When the King advanced from Nottingham, and approached near
Shrewſbury, he drew up his little army, and made them a ſpeech: 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>I promiſe,</hi> ſaid he to the ſoldiers,
<hi>in the preſence of Almighty God, and as I hope for his bleſſing and
protection, that I will ever defend the Proteſtant religion, and in that
religion am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to live and die. The laws of the land, and the rights
of my ſubjects, ſhall ever be the meaſure of my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and, if
Heaven proſpers this little army raiſed for their King's defence, I
promiſe to rule by parliaments alone, and by every equitable
adminiſtration. When I fail in theſe particulars, then let me be abandoned
of men; and in this reſolution I hope for the aſſiſtance of all good
men, end am confident of the protection of Providence.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Eſſex, on the other hand, was reſolved to ſet up his
head-quarters at Worceſter, and await the King; where, in a few days, a
ſkirmiſh enſued in favour of the Royaliſts; and the battle of
Edge-hill, fought ſome time after, ſeemed to confirm the King's
ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority. The Queen had brought him ſoldiers from Holland, with
ammunition and arms, and immediately departed in order to furniſh more. Yet
ſtill the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was not diſcouraged; their demands ſeemed to
increaſe in proportion to their loſſes; and, as they were defeated in the
field, they grew more obſtinate in the cabinet. They condemned of high
treaſon ſuch governors of towns as gave up their fortreſſes to the
King; while he, on the contrary, offered new terms of peace upon every
advantage. But, though his deſire to ſpare his ſubjects was laudable, as
a man, yet his long negotiations were faulty, as a warrior; he waſted that
time in altercation and propoſal, which ſhould have been employed in
vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exertions in the field. Upon the whole, his firſt campaign ſeemed
to promiſe him ſucceſs; his <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0443100202:28"/> generals were moſtly
victorious, and his army far ſuperior to the enemy in point of diſcipline.
On the ſide of the parliament, the great Hampden was ſlain in the battle of
Chaldgrave-field; and on the other hand, on the King's part, the gallant Lord
Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was killed at the battle of Newbury. Theſe were the two
greateſt, braveſt, and wiſeſt men of their time, who thus fell, as if,
by the kindneſs of Providence, to prevent their ſeeing the miſeries, and
the ſlaughter in which their country was ſhortly to be involved.</p>
            <p>Hampden was the perſon who had refuſed paying ſhip-money, and
withſtood the power of the crown; his inflexible integrity gained him the
eſteem even of his enemies; and his humanity and benevolence, the affection
of all that knew him more intimately.</p>
            <p>But Faulkland was ſtill a greater character than he. He added to
Hampden's ſevere principles all the politeneſs and elegance then known in
Europe. He had withſtood the King while he ſaw him mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ill uſe of
his power; but, when he perceived the deſign of the parliament to change
religion, he changed his ſide, and ſtedfaſtly attached himſelf to the
crown. From the beginning of the civil war his natural chearfulneſs and
vivacity grew clouded, and he became ſad, pale, and negligent of his
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the morning of the battle it was ſeen he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to die, and he
profeſſed that the miſeries of his country had already almoſt broken
his heart. He added, that he was weary of the times, and ſhould leave them
before night. He was ſhot with a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet in the belly, and his body was
the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found among an heap of the ſlain. His writings, his
juſtice, and his courage, deſerved ſuch a death of glory; and they lound
it. If there be happineſs in death, it muſt be in ſuch an end, falling in
battle for our King and our principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0443100202:29"/> Each battle ſerved only to weaken the royal
party, and to unite the parliament more ſtrongly together; the King and his
followers were held together only by ſecular motives; the parliament had long
been actuated by one ſtill ſtronger, that of religion; this had hitherto
been the ſecret ſpring of all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and now they fairly threw
by the maſk, united themſelves to the church of Scotland, and ſigned the
ſolemn league and covenant, which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Puritaniſm, and laid the
foundation of a new republic. The King, to oppoſe the deſigns of the
Weſtminſter parliament, called one at Oxford, where it aſſembled; and
England now ſaw what it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before ſeen, two parliaments ſitting
at one and the ſame time. From this partial parliament he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome
ſupplies; after which it was prorogued, and never after convened. The war
went on with its uſual fury, and ſkirmiſhes on both ſides were
fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, which ſerved to deſolate the kingdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deciding victory.
Each county joined that ſide to which it was addicted from motives of
conviction, intereſt or fear; while ſome obſerved a perfect neutrality.
Several frequently petitioned for peace, the wiſe and the good were moſt
earneſt in this cry; but what particularly deſerved remark was, the
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the women of London, who, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of two or three
thouſand, went in a body to the houſe of commons, earneſtly demanding a
peace: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Give us thoſe traitors,</hi> ſaid they,
<hi>that are againſt peace; give them, that we may tear them in
pieces.</hi>
               </q> The guards found ſome difficulty in quelling this
inſurrection, and one or two women loſt their lives in the fray.</p>
            <p>It is both tedious and unimproving to deſcribe all the combats,
the battles, the ſkirmiſhes, that every day paſſed between either
ſide. What towns were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged and taken, how many killed in fight, or
what numbers died by the hand of the executioner; every civil war preſents
the ſame picture to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0443100202:30"/> and this was
aggravated with all the miſeries of rage, reſentment, and deſpair. All
were from principle earneſtly employed in deſtroying the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
there were none of thoſe refined underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who, diſengaged from
the prejudices of party, improved the univerſal prejudice of the time to
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire dominion for themſelves; all were ſeriouſly, earneſtly, and
blindly engaged in the favourite pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. The genius of the times was great
but irregular.</p>
            <p>Among the number who moſt ſeverely felt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the
commons, was the famous William Laud, Archbiſhop of Canterbury; he had been
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the Tower, at the time when nine more of the Biſhops were
ſent there upon remonſtrating to the Lords againſt the ſeverity of the
lower houſe. When he was brought to the bar, in order to make his defence, he
ſpoke ſeveral hours with that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage which is the reſult of innocence
and integrity. The Lords, his Judges, were willing to acquit him; but the
commons were determined upon his death, and over-ruled all remonſtrances made
in his favour. When brought to the ſcaffold, this noble divine, without any
apparent terror, made the people a long ſpeech; he told them, 
<q rend="inline">"that he had examined his heart, and thanked God
that he found no ſins there which deſerved the death he was going to
ſuffer. The King had been traduced by ſome, as labouring to introduce
Popery; but that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him as ſound a Proteſtant as any man in the
kingdom; and as for parliaments, though he diſliked the conduct of one or
two, yet he never deſigned to change the laws of the country, or the
Proteſtant religion."</q> After he had prayed for a ſhort ſpace, the
executioner did his office at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e
blow. This man ſeemed born for a better on fate and better times; but all
diſtinctions of right and wrong were now loſt in mutual animoſity; and in
general the beſt characters on both ſides were thoſe <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0443100202:31"/>
who fell victims to civil fury. He was learned, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſincere; humble
in his private deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but attached to trifling ceremonies, and ready to
loſe his life rather than give them up.</p>
            <p>The liturgy was, by a public act, aboliſhed the day he died, as if
he had been the only obſtacle to its former removal. The church of England
was rendered completely Preſbyterian, to the great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the
Scots, and numbers of the citizens of London. An ordinance was eſtabliſhed,
by which there ſhould be one day in the week appointed as a faſt, and the
money which was thus ſpared to the family, was to be paid in ſupport of the
common cauſe. Thus ſtrengthened, the parliament ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed capable of
carrying on their deſigns in an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner; they had the Scotch to
aſſiſt them; they profeſſed only one religion, and were united with
the bonds of mutual danger. However, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they came to be all
ranked under the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Preſbyterians, they began again to
ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into new parties, as if diviſions were neceſſary to the
exiſtence of this parliament; one part of the houſe were Preſbyterians,
ſtrictly ſo called; the other Independants, a new ſect that had lately
been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and gained ground ſurpriſingly. The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between
theſe two ſects would hardly be worth mentioning, did not their religious
opinions influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence their political conduct. The church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which was
now totally aboliſhed, had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Biſhops and a book of common prayer;
the Preſbyterians exclaimed againſt both; they were for having the church
governed by clergymen elected by the people. The Independants went yet ſtill
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and excluded all clergy; they maintained that every man might pray in
public, exhort his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and explain the ſcriptures; but their chief
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference lay in acknowledging no ſubordination in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular employments,
and attempting to maintain an <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0443100202:32"/> ideal equality, to which
they juſtly obſerved that every man was born. Were ſuch a plan of
govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment practicable, it would no doubt be the moſt happy; but the wiſe
and powerful muſt ever govern over ignorance and debility, and the bad
ſucceſs of their ſchemes, ſoon after carried into execution, ſhewed
how ill adapted they were to human infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Poſſeſſed, however, with
an high opinion of their ſpeculative ſcheme, they behaved with that
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and ſullen carriage which is ever the reſult of narrow manners
and ſolitary thinking. They ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly laboured the abaſement of the
Preſbyterians, yet joined them in their efforts to depreſs the King.</p>
            <p>Charles, now perceiving the parliaments of England and Scotland
united againſt him, and fearing to fall under their united efforts, thought
proper to make a truce with the Papiſts of Ireland, in order to bring ever
the Engliſh troops who ſerved in that kingdom. By this means he not only
had many of the Engliſh troops that ſerved there, but alſo ſeveral of
the native Iriſh who came to increaſe his army. It was then the parliament
complained with truth of his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papiſts in his ſervice, and ſtill
farther extended their reproach by ſaying that he encouraged them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.
Theſe troops, however, only ſerved to procure the hatred of his ſubjects,
without ſtrengthening his army. They were totally routed by Fairfax, one of
the generals of the parliament army, and ſlaughtered without mercy after a
ſubmiſſion. It was ſaid, that ſeveral Iriſh women were found among
the ſlain, who with long knives did conſiderable execution; but the
animoſity of the Engliſh againſt thoſe wretches, at that time, might
have given riſe to the calumny.</p>
            <p>One misfortune now ſeemed to follow cloſe upon another: Prince
Rupert, who had long ſuſtained the honour of the royal arms, was defeated
at York, and his army diſperſed by Fairfax. Charles had retired to Oxford;
his preſent danger excited his friends to <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0443100202:33"/> new efforts;
he levied new forces, and had ſome ſlight ſucceſs. But this appearance
of good fortune did not continue. His army was turbulent and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious; that
of the parliament every day improved in diſcipline, and obeyed from
principle. Among inſtances of this nature was that act called the
<hi>ſelf-denying ordinance,</hi> by which it was reſolved, that no member
of the houſe of commons ſhould have a command in the army. The reaſons
aſſigned for this were ſpecious, and perhaps ſincere. It was done to
prevent the parliament's wiſhing for a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the war, in order to
enjoy a continuing ſhare of authority. The former generals were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
changed; the Earl of Eſſex, Denbigh, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter gave up their
commiſſions, and Fairfax, with the aſſiſtance of Cromwell,
new-modelled the army without any oppoſition.</p>
            <p>It was the general opinion, that this new altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would enfeeble
the parliament army, but the event proved otherwiſe; they were, after this,
every-where victorious. Both armies met near Naſeby. The King, who commanded
the main body of his own troops, ſhewed himſelf upon this occaſion a
coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous general, encouraging his ſoldiers where giving way, and rallying
them in perſon when broken. The enemy, however, was victorious; wherever
Cromwell fought, he brought conqueſt and terror; and the defeat of the royal
army was principally owing to him. This fatal blow the King could never after
recover. All his infantry were ſo ſcattered that the enemy took as many
priſoners as they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; his baggage, and cabinet in which his moſt
ſecret papers were contained, fell into the hands of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers; and
yet, after all, there were not above ſix hundred men ſlain upon the field
of battle.</p>
            <p>It was now that Cromwell's courage and genius began to appear; he
had hitherto been only a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ſpeaker in the houſe of commons, and
the <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0443100202:34"/> leader of a regiment in the army. But he now
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered talents greater than his employments, and his preſent
ſucceſs opened to him the proſpects of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which he never after
loſt ſight of. Hiſtorians ſeldom diſtinguiſh properly in the
changes to be found in the ſame character; it is probable Cromwell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to
act in the ſtate with principles of conviction and ſincerity; but, new
occurrences ariſing, his ſoul was not proof to the allurements of fortune;
he gave way to her ſeducing call. Had he been on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſide,
he might have diſplayed ſurpriſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of conſtancy and
integrity; but, happening to be victorious, he became a tyrant and uſurper,
and bathed his country with royal blood.</p>
            <p>Cromwell was poſſeſſed of apparent humility and internal
pride. This is juſt the character which Machiavel deſcribes for a
ſucceſsful uſurper. He was originally the ſon of a private gentleman of
a moderate fortune, who had ſome years before at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted leaving the kingdom
upon a principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but was prevented by the King. This reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
deportment Cromwell ever inviolably preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it ſecured him an
aſcendancy in the houſe of commons, where the majority were
enthuſiaſts; it gained him the affections of Fairfax the general, who was
courageous, ignorant, and ſincere. It acquired him the love of the army,
where his preſence was coveted; and he alone was permitted to unite the
military and civil employments in his perſon, for he had a ſeat in the
houſe while he was a colonel in the field. But he was ſtill reſolved
farther to ſtrengthen his intereſts by attaching the Independants privately
to his ſide; they increaſed in numbers and power by his means, and he, in
return, found them reſolute and perſevering friends.</p>
            <p>The battle of Naſeby ſeemed fatal to the intereſts of the
King; and Fairfax and Cromwell availed themſelves of the circumſtances that
offered. Every city that they <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0443100202:35"/> appeared before capitulated.
The young Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II, participated in the
misfortunes of his father, and fled to the iſland of Scilly. The King drew
the ſhattered remains of his army into Oxford, and once more demanded peace.
But, if he could not obtain it in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſtate of his affairs, it
was not likely that he could now ſucceed in his deſires after a defeat. The
houſe of commons inſulted his misfortunes. His let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Queen were
publiſhed, with thoſe ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured remarks and railleries which none but the
vicious are capable of making. To be at once mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and malicious is the ſign
of a corrupt heart and mean underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The King, after having taken every meaſure that he thought could
procure peace, without effect, now ſaw himſelf ſhut up in Oxford, a place
almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fortifications, and every day in danger of falling into
the power of a fierce and exaſperated party. In ſuch a ſituation he
therefore was obliged to chuſe the leaſt of two evils, and to deliver
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to the Scotch army, rather than the Engliſh, as he expected to
find leſs animoſity in the former. The Scotch officers had made him ſome
general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, grounded, probably, upon their hopes of his compliance
with every requeſt they ſhould make. He ſent them word of his intention
to come to their army; and they promiſed to receive him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his
ſafety. Upon this precarious aſſurance the King left Oxford, and,
travelling through by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and obſcure places, arrived at the Scotch army in
nine days. From that moment he ceaſed to be free. The Scotch began to
negotiate with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh army, carried their royal priſoner about from
one place to another, and, at length, upon conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of being paid the
arrears due for their ſervice in England, which amounted to two hundred
thouſand pounds, they delivered up their King, and returned 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0443100202:36"/> home laden with the reproaches of all good men, and the
internal conviction of their own baſeneſs. From this period till the
uſurpation of Cromwell, the conſtitution was convulſed with all the
diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of guilt and party. When the kingly power was aboliſhed, the
parliament then took up the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but they were ſoon to lay it down in
turn, and ſubmit to a military democracy; a new form of government, which,
like all other democracies, was turbulent, feeble, and bloody.</p>

            <p>THE civil war was now over; the army of Scotland, being paid the
reward of perfidy, returned to its own country. The parliament had now no enemy
to fear, except thoſe very troops which had fought their battles with
ſucceſs. You have been already informed, that this army, by a political
ſtroke of Cromwell, was rendered indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the parliament, and all its
generals diſabled from ſitting there. The commons therefore were now
willing to get rid of it as ſoon as poſſible, well knowing that, if the
army continued, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving laws, it would preſume to dictate.
They therefore paſſed a vote, by which it was ordained, that a part of it
ſhould be diſbanded, and another part of it ſent over into Ireland. It
may eaſily be imagined that Cromwell would not ſuffer this. Now was the
criſis of his greatneſs, and he ſeized the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; he formed a
council of officers, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of common ſoldiers, called Agitators, who
were appointed to enquire into the grievances of the army, and lay them before
the parliament. The very <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0443100202:37"/> ſame conduct which had formerly
paſſed between the parliament and King was now put in practice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
army and parliament. As the commons granted every requeſt the army roſe in
their demands; theſe accuſed the army of mutiny and ſedition, and thoſe
retorted the accuſation, by alledging a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt deſign in the
parliament to rule alone.</p>
            <p>The King had been confined ſince he came into the power of the
Engliſh, at Holmby caſtle; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were reſolved to be
poſſeſſed of his perſon, and ſent one Joyce, a cornet, who from a
taylor was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an officer, to take the King by force, and bring him a
priſoner to Newmarket. This commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he executed with intrepidity and
diſpatch. It was in vain that the commons, now without power, complained of
this inſolence; the army, inſtead of being awed by their menaces, marched
towards Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and now, in turn, preſcribed laws to their employers.
Cromwell, willing to give all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice the appearance of rectitude,
cauſed eleven members of the houſe of commons to be accuſed. Theſe were
the moſt powerful and leading ſpeakers, which ſo aſtoniſhed the
members, that, willing to appeaſe the army at any rate, they writ to the
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that they were ready to receive any particular charge againſt
ſuch as fell under his diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>This was an overture for peace, but pre-eminence was what the army
aimed at; inſtead therefore of being pleaſed at this condeſcenſion, the
general turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their accuſation into a general complaint, and tried every
method to provoke a quarrel, which the others endeavoured to evade. The
citizens of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, at length, opened their eyes; they now ſaw the
conſtitution effectually deſtroyed; they ſaw an oppreſſive parliament
now ſubjected to a more oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive army; they perceived their religion
aboliſhed, their King a captive, and their people expoſed to the worſt of
ſlavery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0443100202:38"/> In this exigence the common-council
aſſembled the militia of the city, the works were manned, and a manifeſto
publiſhed, aggravating the hoſtile inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the army. The houſe of
commons was not leſs divided than the ſtate: one part was for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
the citizens to proceed, while the reſt, with the two ſpeakers at their
head, was for the army. The ſlighteſt diviſions, in ſuch a ſituation,
are ſoon attended with violent conſequences. The commons ſeparated, the
ſpeakers, with ſixty-two members, quitted the houſe to ſeek protection
from the army, while thoſe who remained behind gave orders, and
eſtabliſhed laws, as if they had power to enforce obedience.</p>
            <p>Their aſſumed power, however, continued but a ſhort time, for
the army, with the ſpeakers at their head, ſoon approached the city. Fear,
therefore, compelled the common-council to concur in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which they
tacitly diſapproved. They opened their gates to the general, who, attended by
the two ſpeakers and the reſt of the members, repaired to their
reſpective habitations. The parliament, thus over-awed, gave up the command
of the Tower to general Fairfax, and ordered him the thanks of both houſes
for having diſobeyed their commands.</p>
            <p>It ſtill remained to diſpoſe of the King, who had been ſent
priſoner to Hampton-court. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants, at the head of whom was
Cromwell, and the Preſbyterians, in the name of either houſe, treated
ſeparately with him in private; he even had hopes that in theſe ſtruggles
for power he might be choſen mediator in the diſpute, and expected that the
ſtate, at laſt, ſenſible of the miſeries of anarchy, like a froward
child, huſhed by its own importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, would ſettle under its former
tranquil conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. But he was ſoon undeceived, when he found the army
and the generals maſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> in the
diſpute; and when, as he had hitherto been uſed with ſome 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0443100202:39"/> degree of reſpect, upon their prevailing, he ſaw
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf treated with very little deference or conſideration. He therefore
reſolved to ſeek ſafety by flight, and, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by two of his
courtiers, fled from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and travelled on horſeback all night
to the ſea-ſide, in order to embark for France, leaving behind him a letter
to both houſes of parliament. His uſual fortunes, however, ſtill attended
him here; no ſhip was in readineſs at the place appointed, and he had no
other method left, but to truſt to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of the Governor of the
Iſle of Wight for protection. Colonel Hammond was then in that command; a
creature of Cromwell, who had been placed there by the intereſt of John
Hampden, whom we have ſeen ſuch an oppoſer of the King. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
attendants, whoſe names were Aſhburnham and Berkeley, went to talk with the
Governor upon this important occaſion, who, inſtead of promiſing the
protection required, only returned an evaſive anſwer, and deſired to be
conducted to the King. Upon this all three went together to the houſe, where
the unfortunate Monarch expected their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival; but Hammond ſtaid below.
When Aſhburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham informed his Majeſty that Hammond was come to wait upon
him, but that he had given no promiſe for protection, the King, who had now
found almoſt all the world unfaithful, could not help crying out, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>O Jack, thou ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> undone me.</hi>
               </q> Aſhburnham burſt into a ſhower of tears,
and offered to kill Hammond that moment with his own hand. The humane Monarch
would not permit this. Hammond was brought up, and the King being compelled to
follow him to Cariſbrook caſtle was once more made a priſoner, and
treated by Hammond with only the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of reſpect.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the parliament continued every day to grow more
feeble, and more factious; the army more powerful, and better united among each
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0443100202:40"/> other. Cromwell had taken every precaution to
eſtabliſh ſuch a ſubordination among his troops, as was neceſſary
to conduct them with eaſe, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate his proceedings. But his views
were in ſome danger of being controverted, at this juncture, by a new and
unheard-of confederacy. The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants were for having no ſubordination in
govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A ſet of men called Levellers now aroſe, who declared
againſt any other governor than Chriſt. They declared that all degrees
ſhould be levelled, and an equality univerſally eſtabliſhed in titles
and eſtates. They preſented ſeveral petitions, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their
inſolence to an immeaſurable pitch. Cromwell at once ſaw that he was now
upon the point of loſing all the fruits of his former ſchemes and dangers,
and dreaded this new faction ſtill the more, as they turned his own pretended
principles againſt himſelf: thus finding all at ſtake, he was
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, by one reſolute blow, to diſperſe the faction, or periſh
in the attempt. Having intimation that the Levellers were to meet at a certain
place, he unexpectedly appeared before the terrified aſſembly, at the head
of his red regiment, which had been hitherto invincible. He demanded, in the
name of God, what their aſſembly and murmurings would be at; and, receiving
an inſolent anſwer, he laid two of the moſt remarkable dead upon the
ground with his own hands. The guards diſperſing the reſt, he cauſed
ſeveral of them to be hanged upon the ſpot, ſent others priſoners to
London, and thus diſperſed a faction, no otherwiſe criminal than in
having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his own example.</p>
            <p>This action ſerved ſtill more to increaſe his power in the
camp, in the parliament, and in the city. Fairfax, now become a Lord, was
nominally general, but Cromwell was inveſted with all the power of the army.
The King, a priſoner in the Iſle of Wight, ſtill continued to negotiate a
peace; while the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0443100202:41"/> ſaw no other method of
deſtroying the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power which themſelves had raiſed, but by
oppoſing to it that of the King. Frequent propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therefore
paſſed between the captive Monarch and the commons; but the great
obſtacle, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon deſtroying Epiſcopacy, ſtill
defeated every meaſure.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Scotch, aſhamed of having been thought to
have ſold their King, raiſed an army in his favour. Many of the young
nobility in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſeconded their intentions; the King's deſperate
affairs once more began to wear a favourable aſpect, which Cromwell
perceiving, led his veteran army to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain victory. Succeſs ſtill
ſeemed to back his crimes; he defeated their forces entirely at Preſton,
and took the Duke of Hamilton, their general, priſoner. Fair-fax, on the
other hand, was equally ſucceſsful in Kent and Eſſex; the inſurgents
having retired into the city of Colcheſter, which declared for the King, he
blocked them up, and, having compelled them to ſurrender at diſcretion, he
treated them with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity for which the republican army was at that
time remarkable.</p>
            <p>The parli ment ſtill continued to treat with the King, and,
apprehending more from the deſigns of their generals than the attempts of
their Monarch, ſeemed in earneſt, for the firſt time, in their
negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but it was now too late; the army ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned crowned with
their accuſtomed ſucceſs, and with furious remonſtrances demanded
juſtice upon the King. They accuſed him as the cauſe of all the
misfortunes of the kingdom, and inſiſted that his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans and favourites
ſhould ſhare with him in his public puniſhment. This remonſtrance was
ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter backed by petitions from the garriſons diſperſed over
different parts of the kingdom, and the counties of Somerſet and Norfolk
concurred in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Fairfax, being influenced by Cromwell, and 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0443100202:42"/> not perceiving that he was the tool of his crafty
collegue, transferred his royal priſoner from the Iſle of Wight to Hurſt
caſtle. The parliament complained of this arbitrary proceeding, but their
remonſtrances were now but empty ſound. They began to iſſue ordinances
for a more effectual oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but they received a meſſage from
Cromwell, that he intended paying them a viſit next day with his army, and in
the mean time ordered them to raiſe him upon the city of London forty
thouſand pounds. Affrighted at the approaching danger, they complied with his
demand; and, in the mean time, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with his army came and took up his
quarters in the ſkirts of the city. The commons ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the
treaty with the King, but this Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well was reſolved to oppoſe: they
voted, that the carrying the King priſoner to Hurſt caſtle was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the advice or conſent of the houſe. To puniſh them for this, Cromwell
placed guards round their houſe, and made thoſe members priſoners whom he
judged moſt oppoſite to his deſigns. One of his colonels, whoſe name
was Pride, having a paper of names in his hand, ſeized upon one-and-forty,
and ſent them to the Court of Wards, where they were kept under guard.
Theſe were Preſbyterians, the original authors of all the troubles, and who
now fell victims to the ſide they had eſpouſed. The next day an hundred
more of the members were denied entrance; and that part of the houſe which
now remained was entirely compoſed of a ſmall body of Independants,
ludicrouſly called the Rump. Theſe ſoon voted, that the tranſactions of
the houſe, a few days before, were illegal; and that the general's conduct
was juſt and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>This parliament, if it now deſerves the name, was nothing but a
medley of the moſt obſcure citizens, the ſlaves of the army, the officers
of which, being themſelves members, ruled all their proceedings. It 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0443100202:43"/> was now therefore unanimouſly reſolved in this
ſeditious aſſembly to erect an High Court of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, with power to
try the King for treaſon againſt the kingdom. For form-ſake they
deſired the concurrence of the few remaining Lords in the other houſe; but
even here there ſtill was virtue enough left unanimouſly to reject ſo
horrid a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. This no way abated the ardour of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; they voted
that the concurrence of the houſe of Lords was unneceſſary; they declared
that all power was originally derived from the people; a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion true in
itſelf, but which they wreſted to the moſt deteſtable purpoſes.
Colonel Harriſon, the ſon of a butcher, was commanded to conduct the King
from Hurſt caſtle to Windſor. When he arrived there, the council of war
ordained, that he ſhould be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger treated with the deference due to
royalty. All ceremony was laid aſide, and he now ſaw himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of
his ſervants, and expoſed to the contempt of low-bred inſolence. From the
ſixth to the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of January, the time was employed in making
preparations for this aſtoniſhing ſcene of guilt. One hundred and
forty-five perſons were appointed Judges upon this occaſion; and one
Bradſhaw, a practitioner of the law, was elected as Preſident of this
deteſtable ſynod.</p>
            <p>The King was now conducted from Windſor to St. James's, and was
next day produced before the High Court at Weſtminſter-hall to take his
tryal. He ſtill remembered the dignity he owed to himſelf before ſuch an
inferior court; and, taking his place with his hat on, with a ſtern air,
ſurveyed his Judges, who were alſo covered. When his charge was read,
importing that he had been the cauſe of all the blood that was ſhed ſince
the commencement of the rebellion, he could not repreſs a ſmile at once of
contempt and indignation. He then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by what authority he was brought to
ſuch a tryal? To which Bradſhaw replied, that he was <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0443100202:44"/>
tried in the name of the commons of England. The King then objected to the
legality of the tribunal, ſince the ſanction of the Lords and his own were
wanting to complete it; and refuſed to plead to the articles of the
impeachment Being deſired to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſeveral times; and perſiſting in
his refuſal, he was remanded to his confinement, and the court adjourned. At
their ſecond ſitting the preſident again ſummoned the King to anſwer
to his charge; and the King again demurred to the legality of his Judges, and
began to open his objections, when he was interrupted by Bradſhaw, and ſent
back to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as before. At his third appearance he continued firm to his
purpoſe, and refuſed to reply, until he ſhould be convinced that their
proceedings were not contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom. The
fourth and laſt time he appeared before this ſelf-created court of
juſtice, as he was going thither, he was inſulted by the ſoldiers, and
the mob, who exclaimed, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Juſtice, juſtice, execution,
execution.</hi>
               </q> He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the court with the ſame firm
compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as uſual, with his hat on; and while his fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was reading,
in which he was branded with all the odious appellations that malice could
ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, he diſcovered no other emotions than thoſe of pity. In
walking back from this horrid tribunal, the rabble renewed the cry of 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Juſtice, execution;</hi>
               </q> and among other
inſults one miſcreant preſumed to ſpit in the face of his King. He
patiently wiped his face: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Poor ſouls,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>they would
treat their generals in the ſame manner for ſixpence.</hi>
               </q> A ſoldier
more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate than the reſt could not help imploring a bleſſing
upon his royal head; an officer overhearing it ſtruck the pious centinel to
the ground in preſence of the Monarch, who could not help ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>that the puniſhment exceeded the
offence.</hi>
               </q> The day of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was fixed to be the third after his
ſentence; which when it arrived, he was conducted on foot <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0443100202:45"/> through St. James's Park to Whitehall, accompanied by Doctor Juxon,
and guarded by a regiment of foot, under the command of Colonel Tomlinſon.
The ſcaffold was covered with black, in the middle of which were ſeen the
block and ax, with two exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners in maſques. The ſoldiers were placed
round it, and an infinite concourſe of ſpectators waited with ſilent
horror at a greater diſtance. The King ſurveyed all their ſolemn
preparations with calm compoſure; he aſſured the perſons who ſtood
with him upon the ſcaffold, that he thought himſelf guiltleſs of any
crime but that of having given up the Earl of Strafford to the fury of his
enemies; and that he had confidence in the mercy of Heaven. While he thus
avowed his innocence, the Biſhop who attended him warned him that he had but
one ſtage more to heaven; at which the King cried out, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible
crown, where no diſturbance can arrive.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q rend="inline">"You are exchanged, replied the Biſhop, from a
temporal to an eternal crown; a good exchange!"</q> Having now taken off his
cloak, he delivered his George to the Prelate, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically pronouncing the
word, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Remember.</hi>
               </q> He then laid his head on the
block, and ſtretched forth his hands as a ſignal. One of the men in a
maſque ſevered his head from his body at a blow; and the other, holding it
up ſtreaming with gore, cried out, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>This is the head of a traitor.</hi>
               </q> Such was
the death of Charles, who lived long enough to ſee the laws and
conſtitution of his country expire before him. He had the misfortune to be
bred up in high notions of the prerogative which he thought his duty to
ſuſtain. He lived at a time when the ſpirit of the law was in
oppoſition to the genius of the people; and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by old rules,
inſtead of endeavouring to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf to the changes of the
times, he fell in the univerſal convulſion. Many Kings before him expired
by treaſons, plots, or aſſaſſination; but never <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0443100202:46"/>
ſince the times of Agis the Lacedemonian were any but him ſacrificed by
their ſubjects with all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of juſtice. Upon the whole, it
muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that, though the nation was branded by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
with reproach upon this occaſion, yet theſe ſtruggles at length ended in

            <p>CROMWELL, who had ſecretly ſolicited the King's death, now began
to feel wiſhes to which he had been hitherto a ſtranger; he perceived
himſelf not far removed from the object of his moſt unbounded ambition. His
views expanded with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and his firſt principles of liberty
ſhrunk when oppoſed to the unbounded proſpect of power. The parliament,
which was ſtill permitted to enjoy the ſhadow of authority, voted it high
treaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Charles Stewart, ſon of the murdered King, as
ſucceſſor to the throne. They likewiſe voted the houſe of Lords
uſeleſs and dangerous, and paſſed an act for the abolition of all
kingly power. A great ſeal was made, on one ſide of which were engraved the
arms of England and Ireland, with this inſcription, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>The great ſeal of England;</hi>
               </q> on the
reverſe was repreſented the houſe of commons ſitting, with this motto, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>The firſt year of freedom, by God's
bleſſing, reſtored,</hi> 1648.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They next proceeded to try thoſe gallant men whoſe attachment to
their late Sovereign had been moſt remarkable. The Duke of Hamilton and Lord 
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0443100202:47"/> Capel were accuſed, condemned, and beheaded; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others ſhared the ſame fate. The Earl of Norwich and Sir John Owen were
condemned, but reprieved. The Scotch were not a little diſpleaſed at the
death of the Duke, who was executed not only contrary to the laws of war, but
the law of nations; they were therefore determined to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the young
Prince for their King. But their love of liberty, in ſome meaſure, ſeemed
to combat their reſentment; they called him to the throne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but, at
the ſame time, abridged his power with every limitation which they had
formerly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to impoſe on their late Sovereign. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Charles
had neither the virtue, the conſtancy, nor the principles of his father.
Attached to no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he agreed to all their propoſals, and was
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to accept the formalities without the power of a King. He was
received at Edinburgh with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of profound reſpect, and entered
the city by that very gate on which the limbs of the brave Montroſe, one of
his moſt faithful adherents, were ſtill expoſed; but he ſoon found that
the life he was likely to lead would be an inſupportable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to one of
his volatile diſpoſition. He was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded and inceſſantly
importuned by the Scotch fanatical clergy, who came to inſtruct him in
reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and obliged him to liſten to long ſermons, in which they
ſeldom failed to ſtigmatize the late King as a tyrant, to accuſe his
mother of idolatry, and himſelf of an untoward diſpoſition. Upon
appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed days he was obliged to hear ſix ſermons without
intermiſſion. They inſiſted upon his obſerving Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day with a
Jewiſh ſtrictneſs. They even watched his looks; and, if he happened to
ſmile at any part of their abſurd enthuſiaſms, he was reprimanded for
his profaneneſs. Charles for a while bore this inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with hypocritical
tranquility, and even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be highly edified by their inſtructions;
but, <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0443100202:48"/> notwithſtanding this, he only wiſhed for an
opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of eſcaping from ſuch a variety of diſguſting
impertinence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Engliſh parliament, alarmed at the King's
reſtitution in Scotland, ſent to recall Cromwell from Ireland, where he had
carried on the war with his uſual ſucceſs. He had reduced Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny and
many other places, and proſecuted his conqueſts with ſurpriſing
rapidity. However, he now left the war in that kingdom to be carried on by
Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, his deputy-lieutenant; and returned to England, in obedience to the
mandate of the parliament. When he took his ſeat in the houſe, the
ſpeaker thanked him for the ſervices he had done the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. They
then proceeded to deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the war with Scotland. They deſired to
know if Fairfax would conduct the enterprize. Fairfax, a rigid Preſbyterian,
who had all along fought from principle, declined oppoſing a nation which he
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as co-operating in the ſame good work for which he had firſt
drawn the ſword; he therefore declined the command, ſent his commiſſion
to the commons, and retired to ſpend the remainder of his life in privacy and
peace.</p>
            <p>This was an inlet to Cromwell's ſubſequent power; he was
appointed general of the forces of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and ſoon marched into
Scotland at the head of an army of eighteen thouſand men, long accuſtomed
to conquer. He found general Leſly at the head of an army far more numerous
than his own, but undiſciplined and mutinous. After ſome previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſkirmiſhing, Cromwell ſaw himſelf in a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous poſt
near Dunbar, and his antagoniſt ready to take advantage of his incommodious
ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. However, perceiving the Scots preparing to give him battle, he
aſſured his ſoldiers that the Lord had delivered the enemy into his
hands, and ordered his army to ſing pſalms, as already aſſured of
victory. <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0443100202:49"/> The miniſters of the Scotch army were not
leſs ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine in their aſſurances of victory than he; they boldly
promiſed ſucceſs in the name of the Lord, and excited a ſpirit of
impatience among the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Victory, as always before, again declared for
Cromwell, who routed the enemy with great ſlaughter, while he did not loſe
on his ſide above forty men in all.</p>
            <p>Charles, who hated the Scotch army, and only dreaded Cromwell, was
well enough pleaſed at this defeat. It ſerved to introduce him to a greater
ſhare in the command than he was before permitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. He therefore put
himſelf at the head of that remnant which ſurvived the defeat, and
ſtrengthened it by the royaliſts, who had been before excluded from his
ſervice. And now, inſtead of following Cromwell, who led his victorious
troops to Perth, he reſolved to ſeize this opportunity of penetrating into
England, where he expected to be joined by numbers there ſtill attached to
his intereſts. His hopes in this were fruſtrated; his army, on their march,
was leſſened by continual deſertion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Few voluntiers
repaired to the royal ſtandard; and he at length ſaw his vigilant enemy
overtaking him at Worceſter. Both armies fought with equal intrepidity, but
Cromwell was again victorious. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſo complete a victory obtained by
him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Two thouſand periſhed by the ſword, and four times that
number, being taken, were ſold as ſlaves to the American planters. The
conqueror be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maſter of all Scotland, and ſet a price of a thouſand
pounds upon the head of the King.</p>

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0443100202:50"/> to retire into Wales, under the
conduct of one Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drell, a poor but faithful companion in his diſtreſs.
But in this attempt he was diſappointed, every paſs being guarded to
prevent his eſcape. Being obliged to return, he met one Colonel Careleſs,
who, like himſelf, had eſcaped the carnage at Worceſter; and it was in
his company that he was obliged to climb a ſpreading oak, among the thick
branches of which they paſſed the day together, while the ſoldiers of the
enemy went underneath in purſuit of him. From thence he paſſed with
imminent danger, feeling all the viciſſitudes of famine, fatigue, and pain,
to the houſe of one Mr. Lane, a worthy ſubject of his, in Staffordſhire.
Here he deliberated about the means of eſcaping to France. They agreed that
he ſhould ride before this gentleman's daughter, on a viſit to one Mrs.
Horton, who lived in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Briſtol. During this journey he
every day met people whoſe perſons he knew, and once paſſed through a
whole regiment of the parliament army.</p>
            <p>When they arrived at the houſe of Mr. Norton, the firſt perſon
they ſaw was one of his own chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, ſitting at the door, amuſing
himſelf with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people play at bowls. The King, after having taken
proper care of his horſe in the ſtable, was ſhewn to an apartment which
Mrs. Lane had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him, upon pretence of indiſpoſition. The
butler, being ſent to him with ſome refreſhment, no ſooner beheld his
countenance, which was now very pale with anxiety and fatigue, than he
recollected the viſage of his King and Maſter, and falling upon his knees,
while the tears ſtreamed down his cheeks, he cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"I am rejoiced to ſee your Majeſty."</q> The
King enjoined him ſecrecy, and the honeſt ſervant punctually kept his
word. Having ſtaid ſome days in this place, he repaired to the houſe of
Colonel Wyndham, where he was cordially receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0443100202:51"/> that
gentleman's family having ever been noted for loyalty. Purſuing his route to
the ſea-ſide, he once more had a very providential eſcape from the little
inn at which he lodged. It happened to be a ſolemn faſt, and a fanatical
weaver, who had fought in the parliament army, was preaching againſt the
King, in a chapel fronting the houſe. Charles was actually one of the
audience, A farrier of the ſame principles, who had been examining the
horſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the paſſengers, came to aſſure the preacher,
that he knew by the faſhion of the ſhoes that one of the ſtranger's
horſes came from the North. The preacher inſtantly affirmed, that this
horſe could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to no other than Charles Stewart, and went immediately
with a conſtable to the houſe; but the King, in the mean time, found means
to eſcape. Thus, at length, after inexpreſſible hardſhips, and having
experienced the fidelity of forty different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ranks, who had
power to betray him, he embarked at Brighthelmſted, and landed ſafely in
Normandy.</p>
            <p>Cromwell, in the mean time, returned to London in triumph, where he
was met by the ſpeaker of the houſe, accompanied by the mayor and
magiſtrates in their formalities. His firſt care, upon his return, was to
take the advantage of his ſucceſſes, by depreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scotch. An
act was paſſed for aboliſhing royalty in Scotland, and annexing it as a
conquered province to the Engliſh commonwealth, impowering it, however, to
ſend a certain number of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the Britiſh parliament. It
was now ſeen with aſtoniſhment, that a parliament compoſed of obſcure
and weak members could govern at once with unanimity and ſucceſs. Without
any acknowledged ſubordination they levied armies, maintained fleets, and
gave laws to their neighbours. Never was Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land more powerful than at this
period. The finances were managed with oeconomy and exactneſs. No 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0443100202:52"/> private perſon became rich by public extortions. The
revenues of the crown, the lands of the Biſhops, and a tax of an hundred and
twenty thouſand pounds each month, ſupplied the wants of the government,
and invigorated all their proceedings.</p>
            <p>Having reduced the Britiſh dominions to perfect obedience, the
parliament next reſolved to chaſtiſe the Dutch, who had given but very
ſlight cauſes of complaint. Doriſlaus, one of the late King's Judges,
being ſent thither by the commons as envoy, was aſſaſſinated by the
royal party that had taken refuge there; St. John, appointed Engliſh
ambaſſador. was alſo inſulted by the friends of the Prince of Orange.
Theſe were grounds ſufficient to incenſe the republic of England to a
war. Its ſucceſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was doubtful; Blake commanded the Engliſh,
and Van Tromp was Admiral of Holland; both equally experienced, courageous, and
active. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral engagements ſerved only to ſhew the excellence of the
Admirals, without determining the balance of naval power. The parliament,
however, was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to continue the war, rightly judging that, when the force
of the nation was exerted by ſea, it would diminiſh Cromwell the general's
power upon land.</p>
            <p>Cromwell was not behind them in penetration; he ſaw they dreaded
his growing power, and wiſhed to diminiſh it; all his meaſures were
conducted with a bold intrepidity that marked his character; and he was now
reſolved to make another daring effort. He perſuaded his officers to
preſent a petition for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of arrears and redreſs of grievances, which
he knew would be rejected with diſdain. The houſe, upon receiving it,
appointed a committee to prepare an act, that all perſons who preſented
ſuch petitions for the future ſhould be deemed guilty of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
This was what Cromwell wiſhed for. He was ſitting in council with his
officers, when inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſubject on which the houſe was
deliberating. <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0443100202:53"/> Turning to major-general Vernon, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I am compelled,</hi> cried he, <hi>to do a thing
that makes the very hair of my head ſtand on end;</hi>
               </q> and, ſtarting up
with marks of violent indignation in his countenance, he haſtened to the
parliament, with a body of three hundred ſoldiers. Upon entering the houſe,
he took his place, and ſat ſome time to hear the debates; and, when the
ſpeaker was about to put the queſtion, he ſuddenly roſe up, and,
reviling them for their ambition and cruelty, he ſtamped with his foot, and
inſtantly the houſe was filled with armed men. Then addreſſing
himſelf to the members, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Get you gone,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>give place to
honeſt men; you are no longer a parliament; I tell you, you are no longer a
parliament; the Lord has done with you.</hi>
               </q> He then accuſed one as a
drunkard, another as a whoremaſter, a third of adultery, and a fourth of
extortion. 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>It is you,</hi> added he, <hi>that have forced
me upon this; I have ſought the Lord night and day, that he would rather
ſlay me than put me upon this work.</hi>
               </q> Then pointing to the mace, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Take away,</hi> cried he, <hi>that
bauble;</hi>
               </q> and, turning out all the members, he ordered the door to be
locked, and, putting the key in his pocket, retired to Whitehall. Thus by one
daring exploit the new republic was aboliſhed, and the whole power, civil and
military, centered in him alone. The preſent unſteady form of the Engliſh
government, is the ſtrongeſt proof of a late philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher's opinion, that
every country is poſſeſſed of a ſet of laws and conſtitutions
beſt adapted to the nature of the inhabitants, the climate, and the ſoil,
which when once broken through, the government muſt continue weak and
unſteady, until the natural conſtitution is reſtored; as in mechanics all
bodies continue to waver till their center of gravity is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>

            <p>THAT parliament, which had long gloried in reſiſting violence,
was now diſſolved by an act of the moſt flagrant oppreſſion. The
people, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, expreſſed no diſlike at their diſſolution.
Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well received congratulatory addreſſes from the fleet, the
corporations, and the army; but he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to put forth all his power at
once; he reſolved to amuſe them with the form of a commonwealth, and
familiarize them by degrees to arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He decreed, that the
ſovereign power ſhould be veſted in one hundred and forty-four perſons,
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the denomination of a parliament; and he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook himſelf to make
the choice. The perſons he pitched upon were the loweſt, meaneſt, and
moſt ignorant among the citizens; he foreſaw, that, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
adminiſtration of ſuch, he alone muſt govern; or that they would ſoon
throw up the reins of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which they were unqualified to guide. To
excel in fanaticiſm ſeemed a neceſſary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this new
parliament. Several, with long names borrowed from ſcripture, were members;
but a man, whoſe name was <hi>Praiſe God Barebones,</hi> was one of the
moſt remarkable; and by his name the aſſembly was afterwards called in
ridicule.</p>
            <p>To this aſſembly was committed the care of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace with
the Dutch; but, being utterly unſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſuch negotiations, the
ambaſſadors of the States were quite at a loſs how to treat with them.
The people exclaimed at ſo fooliſh a legiſlature, and they themſelves
ſeemed not inſenſible of the contempt and ridicule which they every day
failed not to incur. They had now ſat five months without doing any thing of
importance; when at length Rouſe, their ſpeaker, roſe up, and propoſed
that, as they were unable to bear the burthen that was laid upon them, 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0443100202:55"/> they ſhould reſign their authority

               </gap>im from whom they had received it.
Cromwell accepted their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation with pleaſure, and ſent Colonel
White to clear the houſe of the few fanatics who perſiſted in continuing
to ſit. White, entering with a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſoldiers, aſked, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>What they did there!</hi>
               </q> To which replying,
that they were ſeeking the Lord: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Then you may go elſewhere,</hi> cried he,
<hi>for to my certain knowledge the Lord has not been here theſe many
years.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The officers now, by their own authority, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Cromwell
Protector. He was poſſeſſed of that which is the original of all
command, namely, force; for the ſtrong ever give laws to the feeble. The
mayor and aldermen were ſent for; the uſurper was inſtalled at Whitehall,
in the palace of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Kings; he aſſumed the office of Protector;
was honoured with the epithet of Highneſs, and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in London, and
other parts of the kingdom. Thus an obſcure inhabitant of Wales, at length,
roſe to unlimited power, far beyond that of former Kings, by his courage and
his hypocriſy.</p>
            <p>He was about fifty-three years of age when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reign, which
he did with equal conduct, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and ſucceſs. He, in the beginning,
choſe among the officers, the former companions of his dangers and victories,
twenty-one counſellors of ſtate, to each of whom he aſſigned a
penſion of one thouſand pounds a year. The troops were always paid a month
in advance; the magazines were well provided; the public treaſure, of which
he had the diſpoſal, was managed with frugality and care. The Dutch were
compelled to ſue for peace, and he dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the terms. He inſiſted upon
their paying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Britiſh flag. They were compelled to abandon
the intereſt of the King; they engaged to pay eighty-five thouſand pounds,
as an indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for former expences; and to reſtore the Engliſh
Eaſt-India company a part of thoſe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0443100202:56"/> of which
they had unjuſtly deprived them in the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>Every nation with whom the Engliſh had any connection, now courted
their Protector's alliance. Among the number France ſolicited his aid
againſt Spain: Cromwell, though capable of conducting the internal parts of
government, had no ſkill in foreign policy. He lent his aſſiſtance to
humble Spain, at a time when the intereſts of Europe required her
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation. Cardinal Mazarine gave him up Dunkirk. His fleet, under the
conduct of the famous Blake, took the iſland of Jamaica. The kingdom of
Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was entirely reduced to obedience, and treated by him as a conquered
country; many thouſands of the wretched natives ſtrove to find, in
baniſhment, an alleviation of their miſeries; numbers died of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and
by the hands of the executioner not a few.</p>
            <p>Cromwell, to give the greater appearance of juſtice to his
uſurpation, was reſolved to govern by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet by ſuch a
parliament alone as he could govern. He aſſembled them, and diſſolved
them at pleaſure; the houſe of Lords was entirely diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; but he
ſet up a new chamber of parliament, compoſed of his own creatures, to
oppoſe that elected by the voices of the people. Thus, ever active,
vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, and reſolute, he diſcovered every conſpiracy againſt his
perſon, and every inſurrection among the people, before they took effect.
He had the addreſs to prevail upon his parliament to make him an offer of the
crown, merely to have the ſeeming magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of refuſing it, and thus to
confirm his real power.</p>
            <p>His private life was no leſs worthy our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he led an
obſcure life in the palace aſſigned for his habitation, without pomp,
without luxury. When he ſent his ſon Henry into Ireland, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him
but one ſervant in his retinue. His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0443100202:57"/> were
naturally auſtere, and he preſerved the dignity and diſtance of his
character in the midſt of the coarſeſt familiarity. He was cruel from
policy; juſt and temperate from inclination; laborious and exact in all his
deſigns; without eloquence he had the talent of perſuading; and without
ſincerity the art of making ſincere adherents: his dexterity equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſatisfied every ſect; with Preſbyterians, a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian; with Deiſts
a Deiſt; only an Independant in principle. It was by theſe arts he
continued his authority, firſt cemented by blood, and maintained by
hypocriſy and uſurpation.</p>
            <p>Yet, notwithſtanding this conduct, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to render
him truly formidable at home, he was, after a few years reign, become truly
miſerable to himſelf. He knew that he was deteſted by every party in the
kingdom; he knew the fierce ſpirit of the people whom he had made ſlaves;
and he was inceſſantly haunted by the terrors of an aſſaſſination.
To increaſe his calamity, a book was publiſhed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>Killing no
murder;</hi> in which it was proved to be juſt to deſtroy him at any rate. 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Shall we,</hi> ſaid this popular declaimer,

               </q> Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well read this ſpirited treatiſe, and it is

cloaths, and always kept a loaded piſtol in his pocket; his aſpect became
cloudy, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded every ſtranger with a glance of timid
ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. He always travelled with hurry and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and never
ſlept two nights ſucceſſively in the ſame apartment. A tertian ague
came at laſt to deliver him from a life of horror and miſery. He died at
Whitehall, after having nominated his ſon Richard Cromwell as his
ſucceſſor. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evident approaches of death, his
fanatical chaplains affirmed that he would recover, and thanked God for the
undoubted aſſurances they had <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0443100202:58"/> received of his
ſafety. He was even of the ſame opinion himſelf. 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I tell you,</hi> cried he to the phyſicians
that attended him, <hi>I ſhall not die of this diſtemper; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
anſwers have been returned from Heaven, not only to my own ſupplications,
but likewiſe to thoſe of the godly, who carry on a more intimate
correſpondence with the Lord.</hi>
               </q> This behaviour, at his death, is an
undeniable proof that he was in reality more the enthuſiaſt than an
hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite; and, in fact, we are more frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ourſelves, than we
attempt to deceive others.</p>
            <p>Whatever were the differences of intereſt after the death of the
Uſurper, the influence of his name was ſtill ſufficient to get Richard
his ſon proclaimed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector. The parties, however, were now grown too
headſtrong to be controlled by greater abilities; what then could Richard do
who had nothing active in his diſpoſition, no talents for buſineſs, no
know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of government, no ambition, no importance? Oliver, by means of the
army, had long governed the kingdom; they were now left to govern alone. They
firſt therefore preſented a petition to the new Protector, demanding that
no member of the army ſhould be ſubject to the civil power, and that the
officers ſhould enjoy the privilege of chuſing their own general. Richard,
ſhocked at their preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rejected their requeſts, and even
threatened to diſmiſs them the ſervice. The parliament attempted to
ſupport theſe meaſures of Richard, but the army prevailed; the parliament
was diſſolved by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, and the Protector again reduced to a
private ſtation. The officers, once more being thus left to themſelves,
determined to replace the remnant of the old parliament which had beheaded the
King, and which the late Protector had ſo diſgracefully diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This was called <hi>The good old cauſe;</hi> and ſuch of the higher
officers as ſeemed unwilling to give up their authority to this parliament,
were intimidated by their ſubalterns into a compliance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0443100202:59"/> The Rump parliament, as it was called, being
thus once again eſtabliſhed, began by vigorouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to
leſſen the power of that very army which had juſt now given them all
their authority. They new-modelled a part of the forces, caſhiered ſuch
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers as they feared, and placed others in their room. Theſe attempts,
however, did not paſs without vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous efforts in the principal officers who
were at London to oppoſe them. They held ſeveral conferences together to
ſtrengthen their power, and leſſen that of their oppoſers. They at
length came to the uſual reſource of theſe turbulent times; they firſt
preſented a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious petition; and, upon finding it rejected, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by general Lambert, they entered the houſe, excluded the members,
diſſolved the parliament by their own authority, and formed a council of
ten to provide for the ſafety of the commonwealth. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe
tranſactions, general Monck was at the head of twelve thouſand veterans in
Scotland. Monck had begun his fortunes under the command of the late King, and
was taken priſoner in his ſervice. Upon the death of his Maſter he was
releaſed from his long confinement to command under Cromwell, for whom he
always fought with conduct and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>In this anarchy and confuſion he ſeemed agitated by different
deſigns, between loyalty to his lawful King, ambition to advance himſelf,
and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions he was under from the governing part of the nation;
his loyalty at length prevailed; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to reſtore the royal family,
but to uſe all the precautions that were requiſite for their ſafety and
his own. He ſoon had an opportunity of embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the affairs of the
nation ſtill more, to prepare the way for her meditated revolution. The
officers, now formed into a council of ten, had ſent to treat with him; he
conſented to a negotiation only in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to gain time; and after a treaty
had been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0443100202:60"/> ſigned by thoſe he employed in this
buſineſs, he refuſed to ratify it upon frivolous pretences. The depoſed
parliament, finding that Monck had diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the proceedings of the
officers at London, were reſolved to avail themſelves of his friendſhip,
in order to be reinſtated in their former authority; and ſent him a private
commiſſion, appointing him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of all the forces in
England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Ireland. He now therefore reſolved to march towar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s London, and upon his approach the
officers wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had depoſed the
parliament found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves almoſt deſerted, and at length compelled to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the authority they had uſurped. When he reached St. Alban's, he
ſent a letter to the houſe, deſiring that London ſhould be cleared of
all other troops to make way for his approach. This demand awakened the
ſuſpicion of the parliament, but they were reluctantly obliged to comply.
He entered London in triumph at the head of his army, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the
council of ſtate, but refuſed taking the oath of abjuration, ſhrewdly
obſerving that the fewer oaths were taken, the cleaner would the
conſciences be. He next examined his officers, and, having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their
concurrence, he reſtored thoſe members to the parliament which long ſince
had been ſecluded before the trial of the King.</p>
            <p>The Independants, who had voted for the trial of Charles, were now
greatly out-numbered; and it was ſoon ſeen that the royal party was likely
to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. The republicans, who, though they hated a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, ſtill more
feared the royal reſentment, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſuade Monck to aſſume
the ſovereign power, in imitation of Cromwell. He rejected their advice, and
in the mean time gave the King private intimations of his deſigns,
new-modelled the army, quelled an incipient inſurrection, and prepared all
things for his reſtoration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0443100202:61"/> Nothing now was wanting, but the authority and
conſent of a free parliament, to ſettle the fluctuating conſtitution. On
the twenty-fifth of April 1660, the new parliament met in both houſes, after
the manner of their anceſtors. They immediately voted that the government
ought to be veſted in a King, Lords, and Commons. On the eighth of May
Charles II. was proclaimed in London; on the twenty-ſixth he arrived at
Dover; on the twenty-ninth he reached Whitehall through an innumerable
multitude of people, who rent the air with their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations. The wretched
kingdom, long torn with faction, and oppreſſed by its own ſtruggles for
free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, once more began to reſpire; fanaticiſm, with all its train of
melancholy terrors and cruelties, was now diſpelled; the arts of peace began
to return; but, unhappily, the arts of luxury entered in their train.</p>

            <p>IT will undoubtedly aſtoniſh poſterity, when they find a whole
nation making theſe ſudden changes from abſolute liberty to the moſt
ſubmiſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; at one time almoſt unanimouſly declaring
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt monarchy, and ſoon after, with the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded flattery,
ſoliciting the ſhackles of arbitrary power. The parliament, which had
before ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently oppoſed the late Monarch, poſſeſſed of every
virtue, were now profuſe in their ſubmiſſions to his ſucceſſor,
whoſe character ſtood in no manner of competition with that of his
father.</p>
            <p>They firſt ordained to have the bodies of Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, Ireton, and
Bradſhaw, dug from their graves, <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0443100202:62"/> and dragged to the
place of execution; here they continued hanging the whole day, and then were
interred under the gallows. Of thoſe who ſat in judgment on the late
Monarch's trial, ſome were dead, and ſome were thought worthy to find
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; ten only out of fourſcore were devoted to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate deſtruction.
Theſe were enthuſiaſts, who had all along acted from principle, and bore
their fate with all the confidence of martyrs. They had been formerly cruel
themſelves, and they were now in turn treated with ſhocking inhumanity; the
exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, not content with performing the office of death, added inſult
to their tortures; the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to a man, thanked God for being permitted
to die for his cauſe, and braved the fury of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors with manly
contempt.</p>
            <p>Their deaths ſeemed to inſpire a few deſperate
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts with the moſt ſtrange confidence that ever deluded a poor
ignorant party. One Venner, who expected the immediate coming of Chriſt upon
earth, appeared in the ſtreets of London in arms, at the head of threeſcore
enthuſiaſts like himſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt any other Monarch but
King Jeſus. They had been wrought into ſuch a pitch of phrenzy as to
believe themſelves invulnerable, and fought as men confident of victory. The
few ſurvivors of their defeat were taken, tried, condemned, and executed:
they affirmed to the laſt, that, if they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Lord
himſelf concurred in the impoſture.</p>
            <p>It was now feared that the tide of loyalty would bear down all the
ſormer mounds of freedom; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſeemed to concur in all the
deſigns of the court, and even to anticipate its wiſhes; but, though the
King was eſtabliſhed, his old faithful friends, and the followers of his
family, were left unrewarded. There were numbers who had fought for his father,
and for him, and had loſt their all in his ſervice, ſtill pining in want
and miſery; while their perſecutors, <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0443100202:63"/> who, prefiting by
the troubles of their country, had acquired fortunes during the civil war, were
ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enjoy them without moleſtation. The ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
petitioned in vain; Charles was no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for gratitude; his
pleaſures, his flatterers, and concubines engroſſed all his attention,
and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted his finances; the unhappy Cavaliers murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without
redreſs; he fled from their gloomy expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations to ſcenes of mirth,
riot, and feſtivity.</p>
            <p>The kingdom now ſeemed to be converted into a theatre of
debauchery, which had before been a ſcene of blood. The Independants were no
longer to be ſeen; the Puritans were reſtrained; the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the late
war were the ſubject of ridicule; the formality and the ignorance of
ſectaries were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played upon the ſtage, and even laughed at in the
pulpit. The King had no religion; and, though he permitted the perſecution of
ſectaries, it was merely from political motives. The late miſeries of the
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were not ſufficient to deter a few deſperate fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from
attempting to excite them afreſh; they laid a ſcheme for ſurpriſing
ſeveral towns in the North, and raiſing a general inſurrection; the
mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry diſcovered the plot, before it was ripe for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thirty of
the conſpirators were taken and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; and this plot was a pretext for
continuing the parliament then ſitting, and repealing the act for triennial
parliaments, as being dangerous in times of commotion.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh parliament ſeemed willing to make the King
reparation for their former diſobedience, and the Scotch were ſtill more
ſanguine in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their attachment. Had Charles been an
active Monarch, he might have now become an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute one. They confirmed the
doctrine of paſſive obedience by a ſolemn act; they aſſigned him a
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of twelve hundred thouſand pounds, excluſive of the expence
neceſſary for ſitting and ſupplying <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0443100202:64"/> the fleet.
None of his predeceſſors were ever poſſeſſed of ſuch a large
revenue; nevertheleſs, his prodigality rendered him indigent, and, inſtead
of deſiring an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendancy over his parliament, he was content to be an
humble and continual dependant on their bounty.</p>
            <p>His prodigality, his libertiniſm, and the familiarity with which
he permitted himſelf to be treated by his ſubjects, ſoon began to alter
their ſentiments from a veneration for royalty to a contempt of his perſon
and adminiſtration. He declared war againſt Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, merely to have an
opportunity of ſpending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his pleaſures. a part of thoſe ſums
granted him by parliament for the ſupport of a fleet and army. This war was
carried on with doubtful ſucceſs; but the alarm which the nation received
from Ruyter the Dutch Admiral's attempting to ſail up the river Thames,
ſtill more diſguſted them againſt their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. Immediate dangers,
though ſmall, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the mind with greater force than diſtant, though
terrible calamities. They now called to mind the adminiſtration of Cromwell,
when the people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſecurity at home, and were reſpected abroad; they
recollected that vigorous Uſurper's labours for the good of the nation, and
compared them with thoſe of the preſent effeminate and unſucceſsful
reign.</p>
            <p>Natural and accidental calamities ſeemed to unite themſelves to
thoſe brought on by bad management. A plague ravaged the city, which ſwept
away more than one hundred thouſand of its inhabitants; and ſoon after the
city was almoſt entirely deſtroyed by a conflagration, which raged for
three days without intermiſſion. The ſpirit of the people ſoon
ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe calamities; London ſoon roſe more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful from its
aſhes; the ſtreets were built anew more ſpacious and convenient than
before; and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs ſoon became their advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0443100202:65"/> But neither war, nor accident, nor the murmurs
of the people could abate the paſſion for gallantry, pleaſure, and
expence, that reigned through the court through the King's example. He had
imbibed all that ſpirit of levity, during his reſidence in France, for
which that kingdom is remarkable. Though he had been married ſoon after his
reſtoration to the Infanta of Portugal, he kept ſeveral miſtreſſes,
by whom he had natural iſſue. Among this number were mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle
Queroüaille, a French woman, whom he created Ducheſs of Portſmouth;
Mrs. Palmer, whom he made a Counteſs; and Nel Gwyn and Mrs. Davis,
actreſſes taken from the theatre.</p>
            <p>But, though the court was thus loſt to decency, the paſſion
for uniformity in religion in the nation ſeemed to revive. The parliament was
equally ſet againſt the Preſbyterians and the Papiſts; an act was made
called the <hi>Teſt act,</hi> importing that every perſon in office and
employment ſhould take the oaths of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iegiance and ſupremacy, receive the
ſacrament in ſome pariſh church before competent witneſſes, and
ſubſcribe a declaration, renouncing the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation.
This was levelled againſt the Duke of York, the King's brother, who had
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf a Papiſt, and whom the parliament ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly aimed
at excluding from the throne. The fears and diſcontents of the nation were
vented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtraint; the apprehenſions of a Popiſh
ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, an abandoned court, a parliament that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, without
a new election, for ſeventeen years; an alliance cemented with France, the
ſecret enemy of England and the Proteſtant religion; and an
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful and expenſive war with Holland, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural allies; all
gave cauſe to kindle a ſpirit of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation among the people. The court
tried every method, but in vain, to ſatisfy theſe murmurs, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
them. Even the coffee-houſes were ſuppreſſed where ſuch topics were
generally debated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0443100202:66"/> This univerſal ferment, as may eaſily be
imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, broke out into an alarm. When the ſpirit of the Engliſh is once
excited, they either find objects of reſentment, or they make them. A rumour
of a Popiſh conſpiracy was firſt propagated, and one Titus Oates ſoon
appeared to give it confirmation. Titus Oates had been from his youth an
indigent and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous adventurer. He was abandoned, illiterate, and
ſhameleſs. He had been once indicted for perjury, afterwards chaplain of a
man of war, and diſmiſſed for unnatural practices. He then profeſſed
himſelf a Roman Catholic, went to the Jeſuits College at St. Omer, but was
diſmiſſed, after ſome reſidence there, with infamy. He then returned
to London, filled with projects of revenge; and the animoſities of this
unhappy nation ſoon appeared a proper place of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to give this
viper's virulence effect. He depoſed upon oath, that the Jeſuits, ſeveral
of whom he named, and who were ſoon after taken up, had tried the King under
the name of the <hi>Black Baſtard,</hi> condemned him as an heretic, and
reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of life: that ſeveral attempts had been made
without ſucceſs, and that not only the King's brother, but even the Queen
were privy to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The houſe of commons immediately took fire at
this pretended conſpiracy; they petitioned for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Queen, rewarded
Oates with a penſion of twelve hundred pounds, and immediately ordered the
conſpirators to be tried in the courts of juſtice. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Jeſuits were
tried; their very profeſſion was at that time ſufficient to deſtroy
them; before a partial Judge and an exaſperated Jury, no mercy could be
expected, and ſeveral, though apparently innocent, were executed as traytors
upon this miſcreant's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Coleman, the Duke of York's ſecretary,
Ireland, Pickering, Grove, Fenwick, and White-bread were among the firſt that
fell; they died de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0443100202:67"/> their innocence to the laſt
moment of their lives.</p>
            <p>While the Proteſtants were labouring to humble both the Puritans
and the Papiſts, thoſe two parties were at the ſame time mutually
employed in ruining each other. Plot was ſet againſt plot; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
by Oates was called the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> that ſet to oppoſe it was
called by the name of the <hi>Meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tub Plot,</hi> as the ſcheme of the
conſpiracy was found hidden in a meal-tub. This was a deſign againſt
Oates, for his perjuries had drawn upon him the furious reſentment of the
Catholic party; they were determined to take away his life by the ſame
falſe evidence by which he had taken the lives of ſo many others.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe plots tending to diſturb the peace of the kingdom,
it is ſaid the Earl of Shafteſbury was at the bottom; he had been a member
of the Long Parliament in the civil wars, and had gained great influence among
the Preſbyterians; he had inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated himſelf into the confidence of
Cromwell, and afterwards employed his credit in forwarding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.
He had been made one of the privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>council in the preſent reign, but was
ejected thence for the duplicity of his conduct. He was poſſeſſed of
uncommon abilities, joined with turbulence, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, and unbounded
ambition. It was thought that this nobleman, in revenge for his diſgrace at
court, headed the demagogue faction, and alarmed the King with unceaſing
dangers.</p>
            <p>He artfully increaſed the people's apprehenſions of a Popiſh
ſucceſſor, and, by his intereſt, brought a bill into the houſe of
commons for the excluſion of James Duke of York from the ſucceſſion. In
the national animoſity raiſed againſt Papiſts it was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
matter to have it paſſed through the houſe of commons; but, being
preſented to the houſe of peers, it was thrown out by a great majori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0443100202:68"/> The commons were greatly incenſed at this
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, but particularly their anger fell upon the Earl of Halifax, who
exerted himſelf in the oppoſition. Halifax diſregarded their anger,
ſecure in conſcious innocence. But their rage fell with more weight upon
Lord Stafford, who had long been a priſoner in the Tower, upon the
depoſition of Oates. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his age, his weak intellects, and the
juſtneſs of his defence, he was arraigned, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and executed for a
plot which had its only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in perjury and ſubornation. All things
threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened a renewal of the former troubles from which the kingdom had been
but lately ſet free. The commons preſented petition after petition to the
King, deſiring the puniſhment of Papiſts, and the abridgment of the royal
prerogative. They ſeemed willing to intimidate the King, or to inflame the
nation. At length Charles ſhewed a degree of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that ſurprized even
his friends; he rejected their petitions with contempt, and diſſolved the
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that had abuſed their power.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the nation at that time, with regard to religion, was
thus: The principal men at court, if they profeſſed any, were of the
eſtabliſhed church; ſo were all the men of great property, as well as the
dregs of the people; but that body of men who voted at elections, placed
between a ſtate of opulence and penury, were in general Preſbyterians. They
were therefore willing to return repreſentatives only of that
perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>Charles, however, was reſolved to try one parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more, and
appointed them to meet him at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, the city of London having long been
diſpleaſing, by reaſon of their republican principles. The new
parliament, however, ſeemed ſtill more turbulent than the former; the
members came armed, and attended by their friends and adherents, as if they
expected to fight, and not deliberate. The repreſentatives of 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0443100202:69"/> London were in particular attended by a numerous body of
horſemen, wearing cockades, inſcribed, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>No Popery, no Slavery.</hi>
               </q> To declaim
againſt Popery was the voice of faction in the laſt reign, and ſuch it
was in the preſent. The ſame ſpirit that had animated the former
parliament, ſeemed redoubled in this. They inſiſted on the bill for
excluding the Duke of York from the ſucceſſion; they perſiſted in
declaring that all Papiſts ſhould be baniſhed, and their children
educated in the Proteſtant religion; that the doctrine of paſſive
obedience was injurious to the rights of ſociety. In a word, the leaders of
the oppoſition were reſolved to be diſpleaſed with every meaſure the
King could propoſe, and prepared to recall the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ariſtocracy into the
kingdom. Charles, ſeeing that nothing could be expected from counſels
manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by party, and not deliberation, once more diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this
parliament, with a ſtedfaſt reſolution of never calling another.</p>
            <p>This was a ſtroke they had never expected, and which the times
alone could juſtify. From the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the royal and parliamentary commotions
were ended, Charles ſeemed to rule with deſpotic power, and was reſolved
to leave to his ſucceſſor the faults and the misfortunes of his
adminiſtration. His tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which had been always eaſy and merciful,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came arbitrary, and even cruel; he entertained ſpies and informers round
the throne, and impriſoned all ſuch as he thought moſt daring in their
deſigns. He reſolved to humble the Preſbyterians; all ſuch were
diveſted of their employments, and their places filled with ſuch as
approved the doctrine of non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The clergy teſtified their zeal
to the court by their writings and ſermons; the partizans of the King were
moſt numerous; but thoſe of the oppoſite faction were more
enterpriſing; the mutual animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fity of each was inflamed into rage and
rancour, and the King openly declared himſelf at the head of a 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0443100202:70"/> faction. The city of London particularly fell under his
reſentment; he deprived them of their charter, and only reſtored it when he
had ſubjected the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their magiſtrates to his immediate
authority.</p>
            <p>Such an arbitrary adminiſtration could not fail of exciting new
inſurrections; ſeveral noblemen, among whom were the Duke of Monmouth, the
King's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſon, the Lord Shafteſbury, Ruſſel, Grey, and others,
entered into a combination to deſtroy the King, which was called after the
<hi>Rye-houſe plot.</hi> The conſpirators met at the houſe of one
Shepherd, a wine-merchant, where they propoſed a riſing in London,
Briſtol, Devonſhire, and Cheſhire. They agreed upon a declaration for
juſtifying their deſign, but the ſcheme was at firſt delayed from the
difficulty of the preparations previous to taking the field, and ſoon after
diſcovered by one Keiling, who expected to earn a pardon for himſelf by
impeaching his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates. As the plot began to open, new informers came
in; Monmouth abſconded, Grey eſcaped the meſſenger who had been ſent
to arreſt him, Ruſſel was committed to the Tower, and Shafteſbury, who
foreſaw the danger, had taken refuge in Holland. Lord Eſſex, Sidney, the
great philoſopher and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and Hampden, grandſon of the famous man of
that name, were informed againſt, and committed to confinement.</p>
            <p>The principal informer upon this occaſion was Lord Howard, a man
every way debauched, and who was willing to accept infamy for ſafety: by his
evidence Ruſſel and Sidney were condemned, and died with that intrepidity
which was worthy a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe. While theſe men were thus executed,
Monmouth was in the mean time ſoliciting his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and he who was moſt
culpable, as his crime was moſt unnatural, eaſily obtained it.</p>
            <p>The ſeverities exerciſed in the latter part of this reign
aroſe merely from the influence of the Duke <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0443100202:71"/> of York, who
was as much inclined to cruelty by nature, as his brother Charles was prone to
forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. His authority was become terrible even to the miniſtry; by
his advice the King ſeized upon all the charters of the corporations, in
order to extort mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for having them renewed. Partiality and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
were the inſtruments of his power, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry and innovation the objects of
his aim. At this period the reign of Charles was as abſolute as that of any
Monarch in Chriſtendom, and new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents and treaſons were ſecretly
diffuſing their poiſon, the ſpirit of liberty ſtill ſtruggling hard
againſt the ſpirit of obedience, which the clergy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to inculcate.
Another civil war threatened the nation, ſtill more dreadful than the former,
as the forces were more equally divided. But Charles happily died before
thoſe calamities could return; he was ſuddenly ſeized with an apoplectic
fit, in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his reign.
The people, though they deſpiſed his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, loved his perſon;
they were willing to bear with the faults of one whoſe whole behaviour was a
continued inſtance of good-nature and affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but they were by no means
willing to grant the ſame indulgence to his ſucceſſor, whom they hated
for his pride, his religion, his cruelty, and connections. He was unfit to walk
in the irregular ſteps of his predeceſſor; and, when he purſued the
ſame route, fatal experience ſoon convinced him that he had at once
miſtaken himſelf and the people he attempted to command.</p>
            <p>But, though England, during the reign of Charles, ſeemed ſtill,
in ſome meaſure, agitated like the ocean after a ſtorm, yet commerce
continued to increaſe with its uſual celerity and ſucceſs. The
manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of certain ſtuffs, glaſs, copper, ſteel, paper, hats, and
ſtockings, were now brought to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Upon the baniſhing the
Proteſtants from <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0443100202:72"/> France, numbers came and ſettled
here, and brought their arts with them. This application to arts and commerce
gave England great weight in the balance of Europe; Britain became the center
of politics and arms. Though literature was but little encouraged by the
Sovereign, yet the learned made great profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in every department of
ſcience; and the philoſophers of England began to take the lead. Newton,
Tillotſon, Burnet, Hobbes, and Shafteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury enlarged the land-marks of
human knowledge; Butler, Dryden, Otway, gave ſtrength and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the
language. In a word, the character of the nation now began to alter; the
natural rudeneſs of the inhabitants began to take a poliſh from good
breeding, and Britiſh ferocity to meliorate into cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and humanity.</p>

            <p>AS we deſcend, we find the materials for Engliſh hiſtory
increaſe; the minuteſt tranſactions are recorded with prolixity; and
theſe, however dry and unimproving to ſome, are yet both intereſting and
ſatisfactory to others. In ſuch a profuſion of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials I muſt be
content rather to give the ſpirit of the following reigns, than pretend to
exhibit an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical detail of particular intereſts and intrigues. It
will be enough to mark thoſe ſtrong out-lines that may probably eſcape
the wreck of time, when the internal colouring ſhall fade. As hiſtory
increaſes in time by the addition of new events, an epitome becomes more
neceſſary to abridge its excreſcences.</p>
            <p>The Duke of York, who ſucceeded his brother, with the title of
King James the Second, had been bred a Papiſt, and was ſtrongly bigotted to
his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0443100202:73"/> It is the property of that religion,
almoſt ever, to contract the ſphere of the underſtanding; and, until
people are, in ſome meaſure, diſengaged from its prejudices, it is
impoſſible to lay a juſt claim to extenſive views, or conſiſtency
of deſign. The intellects of this Prince were naturally weak, and his
bigotted principles ſtill rendered them more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he conceived the
ridiculous project of reigning in the ſame arbitrary manner of his
predeceſſor, and changing the eſtabliſhed religion of his country, at a
time when his perſon was hated, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion was
univerſally approved.</p>
            <p>The people of England were now entirely changed from what they had
been in the times of Henry, Mary, and Elizabeth, who had altered religion at
will. Learning was now as much cultivated by the laity as by the prieſthood;
every man now pretended to think for himſelf, and had rational grounds for
his opinion. In the beginning of the reformation the Monarchs had only to bring
over the clergy, in order totally to change the modes of belief, for the people
were entirely guided by their paſtors. To influence the prieſthood was an
eaſy taſk. The hopes of preferment, or the fears of degradation, entirely
ſubjected the conſciences of the clergy to the royal will. Such it was
then; but the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the nation were, at preſent, entirely
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; and, to make a change in religion, it would have been neceſſary
to tamper with every individual in the ſtate. But James had no idea of the
alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of circumſtances; his ſituation, he thought, ſupplied him
with authority, and his zeal furniſhed him with hope of accompliſhing this
chimerical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs he met with in cruſhing a rebellion, in the
opening of his reign, ſeemed to promiſe a favourable omen towards the
completion of his wiſhes. The Duke of Monmouth, who had long 
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0443100202:74"/> been at the head of faction, and inflamed all the
diſcontent that moleſted the late King's reign, was now reſolved to aim
at the crown. He was the darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people; and ſome averred that the
King had married his mother, and owned his legitimacy at his death. The Earl of
Argyle ſeconded his views, and they formed a ſcheme of a double
inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Argyle firſt landed in Scotland, publiſhed his
manifeſtoes, put himſelf at the head of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred men,
and attempted to influence the nation; but, a formidable body of the King's
forces coming againſt him, his army fell away, and he himſelf, after being
wounded in attempting to eſcape, was taken by a peaſant, ſtanding up to
his neck in water. Being brought to Edinburgh, he prepared for death, well
knowing that it was not in the King's nature to forgive an enemy.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Monmouth was not more fortunate; he ſailed from the
Texel with three veſſels, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the coaſts of Dorſetſhire
with about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore followers. The country ſoon flocked in to his
ſtandard, and in two days his army was increaſed to two thouſand men. The
Earl of Feverſham was ſent to oppoſe him, and took poſt at Sedgemore, a
village in Somerſetſhire. Monmouth reſolved to fight him, and began his
march about eleven in the night, with profound ſilence; but the Royaliſts
were prepared for his reception. The action began at day-break; Lord Grey, who
commanded the Duke of Monmouth's horſe, was routed at the firſt onſet.
The Duke, at the head of his infantry, bravely maintained his ground until he
was charged in flank by the enemy's horſe, who had been juſt now
victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. A total rout enſued; three hundred were killed in the
engagement, and a thouſand in the purſuit. The Duke eſcaped the carnage,
and, in a ſhepherd's diſguiſe, fled on foot, attended by a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
companion, who had followed his fortunes into <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0443100202:75"/> England.
Thus they travelled onward towards Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, till, quite exhauſted
with hunger and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, they lay down in a field, and covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſtubble. In this forlorn ſituation he was found, with ſome peaſe
in his pocket, which he had gathered in the fields to ſuſtain life. His
ſpirit ſunk with his misfortunes; he wrote to the King; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored his
mercy; the King gave him an audience, as if willing to ſatisfy his vengeance
with the ſight of a rival's miſery. But his death was determined, and no
intreaties could extort royal clemency. On the ſeaffold he reſumed his
former courage, handled the ax, declared that he meant well to the nation, and
his head was cut off, but not till after the third blow.</p>
            <p>But it were happy for the nation, and fortunate for the King, if the
blood that was already ſhed had been thought a ſufficient explation for the
late offence. The victorious army behaved with the moſt ſavage cruelty to
the priſoners taken after the battle. Their inhumanity was properly
ſeconded by Jefferies, who was ſent on the weſtern circuit to try the
inſurgents. His furious thirſt of blood being inflamed by continual
intoxication, he threatened, calumniated, and threw aſide even the appearance
of clemency. Men and women indiſcrimately felt the effects of his ſavage
zeal; and not leſs than two hundred and fifty perſons expired under
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of wanton cruelty. Cruel Kings ever find cruel
miniſters.</p>
            <p>It was not to be expected, that theſe butcheries could acquire the
King the love or the confidence of his people, or tend to alter their opinions,
as they rather excited the ſecret abhorrence of every honeſt man. Yet he
thought this a time favourable for the carrying on his ſcheme of religion and
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary government. An attempt at arbitrary power in Charles was, in ſome
meaſure, excuſable, as he <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0443100202:76"/> had a republican faction to
oppoſe; and it might have been prudent, at that time, to overſtep
juſtice, in order to attain ſecurity; but the ſame deſigns in James
were as unneceſſary as impracticable, ſince there were few republicans
remaining, and the people were ſatisfied with limited monarchy. But this weak
and deluded Monarch was reſolved to imitate one or two Princes of Europe, who
had juſt before rendered themſelves abſolute; and he was incited to this
project by Lewis XIV, who ſecretly deſired his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Thus
inſtigated, he began his deſigns with the meaſures which he ſhould not
have uſed till their completion. He ſent a ſplendid embaſſy to Rome,
to acknowledge his obedience to the Pope. Innocent, who then filled the chair,
was too good a politician to approve thoſe childiſh meaſures, and gave
his ambaſſador a very cool reception. He was ſenſible that the King was
openly ſtriking at thoſe laws and opinions which it was his buſineſs to
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine in ſilence and ſecurity. The Cardinals were even heard
facetiouſly to declare, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>that the King ſhould be excommunicated for
thus endeavouring to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the ſmall remains of Popery that yet
ſubſiſted in</hi> England.</q>
            </p>
            <p>James, notwithſtanding his diſcouragements, was yet reſolved
to proſecute his favourite ſcheme with vigour. Upon every occaſion the
Catholics ſhared his confidence and favour. Hugh Peters, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
ruled his conſcience, and drove him blindly forward to attempt innovation. He
became every day more and more ambitious of making converts; the Earl of
Sunderland ſacrificed his religion to his ambition; the Earl of Rocheſter
loſt his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of treaſurer for refuſing to alter his religion. The
King ſtooped ſo low as to his officers; a rough ſoldier one day
anſwered his remonſtrances by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was pre-engaged, for he had
promiſed the King of Morocco, when he was quartered at <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0443100202:77"/>
Tangiers, that, ſhould he ever change his religion, he would turn
Mahometan.</p>
            <p>An Eccleſiaſtical Court was erected, with power to puniſh all
delinquents, or ſuch ſo reputed by the court, with all manner of
eccleſiaſtical cenſures. Before this court was ſummoned the
Vice-chancellor of Cambridge, for having refuſed to admit one Francis, a
Benedictine Monk, to the degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of arts; the Vice-chancellor was
deprived of his office, but the univerſity perſiſted in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal,
and the King thought proper to deſiſt from his purpoſe. The
Vice-preſident and fellows of Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len-college in Oxford were treated with
more ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They refuſed to admit one Farmer, a new convert, and one of
a profligate life, who was nominated by the King to the place of Preſident,
now become vacant. The King next nominated Parker, Biſhop of Oxford; but he
was equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious for the ſame reaſons. The King repaired in perſon
to Oxford; he reproached the fellows with inſolence and diſobedience; but
neither he, nor his miniſters, could prevail to alter the reſolutions of
this ſociety. The fellows were expelled by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and their places
filled with Papiſts, who he knew would be more obedient to his commands.</p>
            <p>His deſigns hitherto were ſufficiently manifeſt; but he was
now reſolved entirely to throw off the maſk. By his permiſſion the
Pope's Nuncio made his public entry into Windſor in his pontificals,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by the croſs, and attended by a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of monks in the habit
of their reſpective orders. He next publiſhed a declaration for liberty of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by which all reſtraints upon Popery were taken away. The
Church of England took the alarm; the peculiar animoſity of the people
againſt the Catholic religion proceeded not leſs from reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious than
temporal motives. It is the ſpirit of that <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0443100202:78"/> religion to
favour arbitrary power, and its reproach to encourage perſecution. The
Engliſh had too oſten ſmarted under both to be willing again to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to either. Seven Biſhops, who had received the King's expreſs orders to
cauſe this declaration of liberty of conſcience to be read in their
churches, refuſed to comply. They drew up a modeſt petition to excuſe
their refuſal, which only ſerved to increaſe the King's reſentment and
rage. They were cited before the council, and ſtill adhered to their former
reſolution with that firmneſs which is the characteriſtic of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The
Attorney-general was ordered to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them for publiſhing ſedition,
and abridging the King's prerogative. They were committed priſoners to the
Tower, conducted thither amidſt the prayers and condolence of an incredible
multitude of the populace, who regarded them as ſufferers for truth. The day
appointed for their tryal arrived; this cauſe was looked upon as the criſis
of Engliſh freedom; the council managed the debate on both ſides with
learning and candour; the jury withdrew into a chamber, where they paſſed
the whole night, but next morning returned into court, and declared the
Biſhops not guilty. The joy of the people, on this occaſion, was
inexpreſſible; the whole city, and the country around, ſeemed at once to
catch the ſhouts of exultation; they even reached the camp, where the King
was then ſitting at dinner, who heard them with indignation and
amazement.</p>
            <p>If the Biſhops teſtified the readineſs of martyrs, in
ſupport of their religion, James ſhewed no leſs obſtinacy in his
attempts towards the eſtabliſhment of his own. Finding the clergy averſe
to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, he next tried what he could do with the army. He thought, if
one regiment would promiſe implicit obedience, their example would ſoon
induce others to the ſame compliance. He ordered one of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments to be
drawn up in his preſence, and deſired <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0443100202:79"/> that ſuch as
were againſt his late declaration of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſhould lay down their arms.
He was ſurprized to ſee the whole battalion ground their arms, except two
officers and a few Roman Catholic ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>Oppoſition only ſerved to increaſe the infatuated Monarch's
zeal; he was continually ſtimulated by his Queen and his prieſts to proceed
raſhly onward. But he was particularly urged on by the Jeſuit Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, his
confeſſor, an ambitious and intriguing prieſt, whom ſome hiſtorians
have even accuſed of being the creature of the Prince of Orange, the King's
ſon-in-law, who had long ſince conceived hopes of ſeizing the crown.
James now, therefore, iſſued orders for proſecuting all thoſe clergymen
who had forborne to read his declaration. He placed one Gifford, a Doctor of
the Sorbonne, at the head of Magdalen College, and likewiſe nominated him to
the ſee of Oxford, lately become vacant. Every member of the Church of
England now ſaw their danger; and Whigs and Tories united their efforts to
oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>William, Prince of Orange, had married Mary the daughter of King
James. This Prince had been early immerſed in danger, calamities, and
politics; the deſigns of France, and the turbulence of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, had ſerved
to ſharpen his talents, and given him a propenſity for intrigue. This great
politician and ſoldier concealed beneath a phlegmatic appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a moſt
violent and boundleſs ambition, all his actions were levelled at power, while
his diſcourſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver betrayed the wiſhes of his heart. His temper was
cold and ſevere, his genius active and piercing; he was valiant without
oſtentation, and politic without addreſs; diſdaining the pleaſures, or
the elegancies of life, yet eager after the phantom of pre-eminence. He was no
ſtranger to the murmurs of the Engliſh, and was reſolved to turn them to
his intereſt. He <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0443100202:80"/> therefore accepted the invitations of
the nobility and others, and ſtill more willingly embarked in the cauſe, as
he found the malecontents had concerted their meaſures with prudence and
ſecrecy.</p>
            <p>A fleet was equipped ſufficient to tranſport fifteen thouſand
troops; and it was at firſt given out that this armament was deſigned
againſt France. James, at length, began to ſee his own errors and the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of the people; he would now have retracted his meaſures in
favour of Popery, but it was too late; the fleet of the Prince was already
ſailed, and had landed thirteen thouſand troops at the village of Broxholme
in Torbay.</p>
            <p>The expectations of the Prince of Orange ſeemed, at firſt, to be
fruſtrated; very few Engliſhmen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him their ſervices, though the
people were, in general, well affected to his deſign. Slight repulſes were
not ſufficient to intimidate a general who had, from early youth, encountered
adverſity; he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ten days in expectation of being joined by the
malecontents without ſucceſs; but, juſt when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to deliberate
about reimbarking his forces, he was joined by ſeveral perſons of
conſequence, and the country people came flocking to his ſtandard. From
this day his numbers began to increaſe; the nobility, which had compoſed
the court and council of King James, now left their old Maſter to ſolicit
protection from the new.</p>
            <p>Lewis XIV. had long foreſeen this defection, and had formerly
offered the King thirty thouſand men for his ſecurity. This was then
refuſed by James, by the advice of Sunderland, his favourite, who was
ſecretly in the intereſts of the Prince of Orange. James, however, now
requeſted aſſiſtance from France, when it was too late for his
ſervice: he wrote in vain to Leopold, Emperor of Germany, who only returned
for anſwer, that what he had foreſeen had happened. He had ſome
dependence on his fleet, <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0443100202:81"/> but they were entirely
diſaffected. In a word, his intereſts were deſerted by all; for he had
long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted them himſelf. He was at the head of an army of twenty
thouſand men, and it is poſſible that, had he led them to the combat
without granting them time for deliberation, they might have fought in his
favour; but he was involved in a maze of fears and ſuſpicions; the
defection of thoſe he moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in took away his power of
deliberation, and his perplexity was increaſed, when told that the Prince of
Denmark and Anne, his favourite daughter, had gone over to the Prince of
Orange. In this exigence he could not repreſs his tears, but in the agony of
his heart was heard to exclaim, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>God help me, my own children have forſaken
me.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He now hung over the precipice of deſtruction! invaded by one
ſon-in-law, abandoned by another, hated by his ſubjects, and deteſted by
thoſe who had ſuffered beneath his cruelty. He aſſembled the few
noblemen who ſtill adhered to his intereſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their advice and
aſſiſtance. Addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Earl of Bedford, father to
Lord Ruſſel, who was beheaded by James's intrigues in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding reign,

<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you are an honeſt
man, have great credit, and can do me ſignal ſervice.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Ah, Sir,</hi> replied the Earl, <hi>I am old and
feeble, I can do you but little ſervice; but I once had a ſon that could
have aſſiſted you, but he is no more.</hi>
               </q> James was ſo ſtruck
with this reply, that he could not ſpeak for ſome minutes.</p>
            <p>The King was naturally timid; and ſome counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors about him,
either ſharing his fears, or bribed by the Prince, contributed to increaſe
his apprehenſions. They reminded him of the fate of Charles I, and
ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the turbulence of the people. He was, at length, perſuaded to
think of flying from a nation he could no longer govern, and of taking refuge
at the court of France, where he was ſure of finding <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0443100202:82"/>
aſſiſtance and protection. Thus inſtructed, he firſt ſent away his
Queen, who arrived ſafely at Calais; and ſoon after, diſguiſing
himſelf in a plain dreſs, he went down to Feverſham, and embarked on
board a ſmall veſſel for France. His misfortunes ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to
follow him; the veſſel was detained by the common people, who not knowing
their Sovereign, robbed, inſulted, and abuſed him. He was now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
by the Earl of Winchelſea to return to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where he was once more
received amidſt the acclamations of the people.</p>
            <p>The return of James was by no means agreeable to William, though he
well knew how to diſſemble. It was his intereſt and his deſign to
increaſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Monarch's apprehenſions, ſo as to induce him to
fly. He therefore received the news of his return with a haughty air, and
ordered him to leave White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, and retire to Richmond. The King
remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt Richmond, and deſired that Rocheſter might be
appointed as the place of his abode. The Prince perceived his intention was to
leave the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; nor did one wiſh for flight more ardently than did the
other deſire him away. The King ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with his deſigns: after
ſtaying but a ſhort time at Rocheſter, he fled to the ſea-ſide,
attended by his natural ſon the Duke of Berwick, where he embarked for
France, and arrived in ſafety, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, for the reſt of life, the empty
title of a King, and the appellation of a Saint, a title which ſtill
flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered him more. Here he continued to reſide among a people who pitied,
ridiculed, and deſpiſed him. He inrolled himſelf in the order of
Jeſuits; and the court of Rome, for whom he had loſt all, repaid him only
with indulgences and paſquinades.</p>
            <p>From this moment the conſtitution of England, that had fluctuated
for ſo many ages, was fixed. The nation, repreſented by its parliament,
deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0443100202:83"/> the long conteſted limits between the King
and the people; they preſcribed to the Prince of Orange the terms by which he
was to rule; they choſe him for King, jointly with Mary, who was the next
Proteſtant heir to the crown. They were crowned with titles of William III.
and Mary, King and Queen of England. The Prince ſaw his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at length,
gratified; and his wiſdom was repaid with that crown which the folly of his
predeceſſor had given away.</p>

            <p>THOUGH William was choſen King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, his power was limited
on every ſide; and the oppoſition he met with from his parliaments ſtill
leſſened the regal authority. His ſway in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where he was but the
Stadtholder, was far more arbitrary; ſo that he might, with greater
propriety, have been called the King of the United Provinces, and the
Stadtholder of England. He was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently acquainted with the
difficulty of governing the nation by which he was elected; he expected in them
a people ready to ſecond the views of his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in humbling France; but
he found them more apt to fear for the invaſion of their domeſtic liberties
from himſelf.</p>
            <p>His reign commenced, however, with the ſame attempt which had been
the principal cauſe of all the diſturbances in the preceding reign, and had
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Monarch from the throne. William was a Calviniſt, and naturally
averſe to perſecution. He therefore began by attempting to repeal thoſe
laws that enjoined uniformity of worſhip; and, though he could not entirely
ſucceed in his deſign, yet a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0443100202:84"/> was granted
to ſuch Diſſenters as ſhould take the oaths of allegiance, and hold no
private conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. The Papiſts alſo enjoyed the lenity of his
government; and, though the laws againſt them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſubſiſt,
yet they were ſeldom put into rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous execution. What was criminal in James
was virtuous in his ſucceſſor: James only wanted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
perſecution by pretending to diſown it; Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam was averſe to
perſecution from principle; and none ſuffered for religious opinions during
his reign.</p>
            <p>But, though William was acknowledged in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland was
ſtill undetermined. The parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that country, however, ſoon
recognized his authority, and took that opportunity to aboliſh epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
which had been long diſagreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nothing now remained to the
depoſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, of all his former dominions, but Ireland. His cauſe was
eſpouſed by all the Catholics of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who were much more numerous
there than thoſe of the Proteſtant perſuaſion. The King of France,
either touched with compaſſion for his ſufferings, or willing to weaken a
rival kingdom by internal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions, granted James a fleet and ſome
troops, to aſſert his claims there. On the ſeventh day of May this
unhappy Monarch embarked at Breſt, and on the twenty-ſecond arrived at
Kinſale. He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Catholics of Ireland with open arms. The
Proteſtants, who were unanimouſly attached to King William, had been
previouſly diſarmed by Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel, their Lord-lieutenant, and a Papiſt.
James made his public entry into Dublin amidſt the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the
inhabitants. He was met by a Popiſh proceſſion, bearing the hoſt, which
he publicly adored; and this ſerved to alienate the few Proteſtants of that
kingdom, who ſtill adhered to his cauſe. A ſmall party of that religion
were reſolved to defend their lives and religion in the little city of
London-derry. They were beſieged by the forces of King <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0443100202:85"/>
James, and ſuffered all the complicated miſeries of war, famine, and
bigotted cruelty; but, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined never to yield, they rejected capitulation,
and always repulſed the beſiegers with conſiderable loſs. At length,
ſupplies and ſuccours arriving from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, King James's army thought
proper to raiſe the ſiege.</p>
            <p>The cruelties exerciſed upon the Proteſtants were as ſhocking
as unneceſſary; ſoldiers were permitted to pillage them without
redreſs; and they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to accept baſe money in exchange for
thoſe commodities they were forced to ſell. But their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were
ſoon to have a period. The Duke of Schomberg was ſent over, with
aſſiſtance; and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam himſelf ſoon after followed, and landed at
Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickfergus. He was met by numbers of the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who had fled from
perſecution; and now, at the head of ſix-and-thirty thouſand men, he was
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go in queſt of the enemy. Having march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Dundalk, and then
to Ardee, he, at length, came in ſight of the Iriſh army. The river Boyne
lay between the two armies, the front of the Iriſh being ſecured by a
moraſs and a riſing ground. Theſe obſtacles were inſufficient to
prevent the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of William, who, when his friend the Duke of Schomberg
expoſtulated upon the danger boldly, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That a tardy victory would be
worſe than a defeat. The Duke, finding his advice not reliſhed, retired to
his tent in a melancholy manner, as if he had a preſcience of his own
misfortune. Early in the morning, at ſix o'clock, King William gave orders to
paſs the river; the army paſſed in three different places, and the battle
began with unuſual vigour. The Iriſh troops, which have been reckoned the
beſt in Europe abroad, have always fought indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently at home; they fled,
after a long reſiſtance, with precipitation, and left the French and
Swiſs regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who came to their aſſiſtance, to make the 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0443100202:86"/> beſt retreat they could. William led on his horſe in
perſon, and contributed, by his activity and vigilance, to ſecure the
victory. James was not in the battle, but ſtood aloof, during the action, on
the hill of Dunmore, ſurrounded with ſome ſquadrons of horſe; and, at
intervals, was heard to exclaim, when he ſaw his own troops repulſing the
enemy, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>O ſpare my Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſubjects.</hi>
               </q> The
Iriſh loſt about fifteen hundred men, and the Engliſh about one third of
that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but the death of the Duke of Schomberg, who was ſhot as he was
croſſing the water, ſeemed to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh all the numbers of the enemy. He
had been long a ſoldier of fortune, and fought under almoſt every power in
Europe. His ſkill in war was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled, and his fidelity equal to his
courage. The number of battles in which he had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally engaged, was
ſaid to equal the number of his years; and he died aged eighty-two. James
fled, regardleſs of the ſafety of his ſoldiers. William rode round the
ſcene of ſlaughter, relieving the wounded, as well of the enemy's troops as
his own. O Regan, an old Iriſh captain, was heard to ſay upon this
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, That, if the Engliſh would exchange gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, the conquered
army would fight the battle over again.</p>
            <p>This blow totally depreſſed the hopes of James; he fled to
Dublin, adviſed the magiſtrates to get the beſt terms they could from the
victor, then ſet out for Waterford, where he embarked for France, in a
veſſel prepared for his reception. Had he poſſeſſed either conduct
or courage, he might ſtill have headed his troops, and fought with advantage;
but prudence forſook him with good fortune.</p>
            <p>His friends were ſtill reſolved to ſecond his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts,
though he had abandoned them himſelf. After his retreat, another deſperate
battle was fought at Aughrim, in which his adverſaries were again
victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; Limeric, a ſtrong city in the ſouthern part of 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0443100202:87"/> the kingdom, ſtill held out in his favour. This city was
beſieged, and made a brave defence; but, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of the King's
fortunes, the garriſon, at length, capitulated; the Roman Catholics, by this
capitulation, were reſtored to the enjoyment of ſuch liberty in the
exerciſe of their religion, as they had poſſeſſed in the reign of
Charles II; and about fourteen thouſand of thoſe who had fought in favour
of King James, had permiſſion to go over to France, and tranſports were
provided for their reception.</p>
            <p>The conqueft oſ Ireland being thus completed, the only hopes of
the fugitive King now depended on the aſſiſtance of Lewis XIV, who
promiſed to make a deſcent upon England in his favour. The French King was
punctual; he ſupplied the fugitive Monarch with an army conſiſting of a
body of French troops, ſome Engliſh and Scotch refugees, and the Iriſh
regiments which had been tranſported from Limeric into France, by long
difcipline, now become excellent ſoldiers. This army was aſſembled
between Cherbourg and La Hogue; King James commanded it in perſon; and more
than three hundred tranſports were provided for landing it on the Engliſh
ſhore. Tourville, the French admiral, at the head of ſixty-three ſhips of
the line, was appointed to favour the deſcent, and had orders to attack the
enemy, if they ſhould attempt to oppoſe him. All things conſpired to
revive the hopes of the hitherto unfortunate King.</p>
            <p>Theſe preparations on the ſide of France were ſoon known at
the court of England, and precautions were taken for a vigorous oppoſition;
all the ſecret machinations of the baniſhed King's adherents were early
diſcovered to the Engliſh miniſtry by ſpies; and they took proper
meaſures to defeat them. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Ruſſel was ordered to put to ſea with
all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible expedition; and he ſoon appeared with ninety-nine ſhips
of the line, beſides frigates and fireſhips. Both fleets met at La Hogue.
On the ſucceſs of <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0443100202:88"/> this engagement all the hopes of
James depended; but the victory was on the ſide of the Engliſh, and of
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; the fight continued ten hours, and the purſuit two days; fifteen
French men of war were deſtroyed; and the blow was ſo deciſive, that from
that time France ſeemed to relinquiſh her claims to the ocean.</p>
            <p>James was now reduced to the loweſt ebb of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence; his
deſigns upon England were quite fruſtrated; nothing was now left his
friends but ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and deſpair, or the hopes of aſſaſſinating the
Monarch on the throne. Theſe baſe attempts, as barbarous as they were
uſeleſs, were not intirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the temper of James: it is
ſaid, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and propoſed them; but they all ended in the
deſtruction of their undertakers. He paſſed the reſt of his days at St.
Germains, a penſioner on the bounties of Lewis, and aſſiſted by
occaſional libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities from his daughter, and friends in England. He died
in 1700, at St. Germains. Some pretend that miracles were wrought at his tomb.
We have ſeen few depoſed Kings that have not died with a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for
ſanctity.</p>
            <p>The defeat at La Hogue confirmed King William's ſafety and title
to the crown: the Jacobites were now a feeble and a diſunited faction; new
parties therefore aroſe among thoſe who had been friends of the revolution,
and William found as much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from his parliament at home, as from
the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the field. His chief motive for accepting the crown was to engage
England more deeply in the concerns of Europe. It had ever been his ambition to
humble the French, whom he conſidered as the moſt formidable enemies of
that liberty which he idolized; and all his politics lay in making alliances
againſt them. Many of the Engliſh, on the other hand, had neither the
ſame animoſity againſt the French, nor the ſame terrors of their
increaſing power; they therefore conſidered the intereſts of the 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0443100202:89"/> nation as ſacrificed to foreign connections, and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that the war on the continent fell moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily on them, though
they had the leaſt intereſt in its ſucceſs. To theſe motives of
diſcontent was added his partiality to his own countrymen, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of
Engliſh ſubjects, together with his proud reſerve and ſullen ſilence,
ſo unlike the behaviour of all their former Kings. William heard their
complaints with the moſt phlegmatic indifference; the intereſts of Europe
alone employed all his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, while he inceſſantly waked over the
ſchemes of contending Kings and nations, he was unmindful of the cultivation
of internal polity. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm was ridiculed as an ideal virtue; the
prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of bribing a majority in parliament became uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. The example
of the great was caught up by the vulgar; all principle, and even decency, was
gradually baniſhed; talents lay uncultivated; and the ignorant and profligate
were received into favour.</p>
            <p>William, upon accepting the crown, was reſolved to preſerve, as
much as he was able, the privileges of a Sovereign. He was, as yet, intirely
unacquainted with the nature of a limited monarchy, which was not then
thoroughly underſtood in any part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, except England alone. He
therefore often controverted the views of his parliament, and was directed by
arbitrary councils. One of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this was, in the
oppoſition he gave to the bill for triennial parliaments; it had paſt the
two houſes, and was ſent up to receive the royal aſſent, which William
refuſed to grant; the commons then voted, that whoever adviſed the King to
this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, was an enemy to his country. The bill, thus rejected, lay
dormant for another ſeaſon; and, being again brought in, the King found
himſelf obliged, though reluctantly, to comply. The ſame oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and
the ſame ſucceſs, attended a bill for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating tryals in caſes of
high treaſon, by which the <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0443100202:90"/> accuſed was allowed a copy
of his indictment, and a liſt of the names of his jury, two days before his
tryal, together with council to plead in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. That no perſon
ſhould be indicted, but upon the oaths of two faithful witneſſes. This
was one of the moſt ſalutary laws that had been long enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but, while
penal ſtatutes were mitigated on one hand, they were ſtrangely increaſed
by a number of others.</p>
            <p>The great buſineſs of the parliament, from this period, ſeemed
to conſiſt in reſtraining corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bringing ſuch to juſtice,
as had grown wealthy from the plunder of the public. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of laws that
were now enacted every ſeſſion, ſeemed calculated for the ſafety of
the ſubject; but, in reality, were ſymptoms of the univerſal corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The more corrupt the commonwealth, the more numerous are the laws.</p>
            <p>William was willing to admit all the reſtraints they choſe to
lay on the royal prerogative in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, upon condition of being properly
ſupplied with the means of humbling the power of France. War, and foreign
politics, were all he knew, or deſired to underſtand. The ſums of money
granted him for the proſecution of this war were incredible; and the nation,
not contented with furniſhing him with ſuch ſupplies as they were
immediately capable of raiſing, involved themſelves in debts, which they
have never ſince been able to diſcharge. For all this profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion England
received, in return, the empty reward of military glory in Flanders, and the
conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of having given the Dutch, whom they ſaved, frequent
opportunities of being ungrateful.</p>
            <p>The treaty of Ryſwick, at length, put an end to a war, in which
England had engaged without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and came off without advantage. In the
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral pacification her intereſts ſeemed intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted; and, for
all her blood and treaſure, the only <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0443100202:91"/> equivalent ſhe
received, was, the King of France's acknowledgment of King William's title to
the crown.</p>
            <p>The King, now freed from a foreign war, laid himſelf out to
ſtrengthen his authority at home. He conceived hopes of keeping up the forces
that were granted him, in time of war, during the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the peace;
but he was not a little mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to find that the commons had paſſed a
vote, that all the forces in Engliſh pay, exceeding ſeven thouſand men,
ſhould be forthwith diſbanded; and that thoſe retained ſhould be
natural Engliſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. A ſtanding army was this Monarch's greateſt
delight; he had been bred up in camps, and knew no other pleaſure but that of
reviewing troops, or dictating to generals. He profeſſed himſelf
therefore entirely diſpleaſed with the propoſal; and his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was
kindled to ſuch a pitch, that he actually conceived a deſign of abandoning
the government. His miniſters, however, diverted him from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and perſuaded him to conſent to paſſing the bill. Such were the
altercations between the King and his parliament; which continued dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his
reign. He conſidered his commons as a ſet of men deſirous of power, and
conſequently reſolved upon obſtructing all his projects. He ſeemed but
little attached to any party in the houſe; he veered from Whigs to Tories, as
intereſt, or immediate exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, demanded. England he conſidered as a
place of labour, anxiety, and altercation. He uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to his ſeat
at Loo in Holland, for thoſe moments which he dedicated to pleaſure or
tranquility. It was in this quiet retreat he planned the different
ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Europe, and laboured to undermine the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics of Lewis
XIV, his inſidious rival in power, and in fame. Againſt France his
reſentment was ever levelled, and he had made vigorous preparations for
entering into a new war with that kingdom, <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0443100202:92"/> when death
interrupted the execution of his ſchemes. He was naturally of a very feeble
conſtitution, and it was now almoſt exhauſted by a life of continual
action and care. He endeavoured to conceal the defects of his infirmities, and
repair his health by riding. In one of his excurſions to Hampton-court, his
horſe fell under him, and he himſelf was thrown off with ſuch violence
that his collar-bone was frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. This, in a robuſt conſtitution, would
have been a trifling misfortune, but to him it was fatal. Perceiving his end
approach, the objects of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer care ſtill lay next his heart; the
intereſts of Europe ſtill filled him with concern. The Earl of Albemarle
arriving from Holland, he conferred with him in private on the poſture of
affairs abroad. Two days after, having received the ſacrament from
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Tenniſon, he expired, in the fifty-ſecond year of his age,
after having reigned thirteen years.</p>
            <p>William left behind him the character of a great politician, though
he had never been popular; and a formidable general, though he was ſeldom
victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; his deportment was grave and ſullen, nor did he ever ſhew any
fire, but in the day of battle. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed flattery, yet loved dominion.
Greater as the general of Holland, than the King of England; to the one he was
a father, to the other a fuſpicious friend. He ſcrupled not to employ the
engines of corruption to gain his ends; and, while he increaſed the power of
the nation he was brought to govern, he contributed, in ſome meaſure, to
corrupt their morals.</p>

            <p>THE diſtreſſes occaſioned by the death of Princes are not
ſo great, or ſo ſincere, as the ſufferers would fondly perſuade us.
The loſs of King William was, at firſt thought, irreparable; but the
proſperity of the kingdom ſeemed to acquire new vigour under his
ſucceſſor Queen Anne. This Princeſs was the ſecond daughter of King
James by his firſt wife; ſhe was, by the mother's ſide deſcended from
Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor Hyde, afterwards the Earl of Clarendon; and had been married to the
Prince of Denmark, before her acceſſion to the crown. She aſcended the
throne in the thirty-eighth year of her age, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone many
viciſſitudes after the expulſion of her father, and many ſevere
mortifications during the reign of the late King. But, naturally
poſſeſſed of an even ſerene temper, ſhe either was inſenſible
of the diſreſpect ſhewn her, or had wiſdom to conceal her
reſentment.</p>
            <p>She came to the throne with the ſame hoſtile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
toward France, in which the late Monarch died. She was wholly guided by the
Counteſs of Marlborough, a woman of maſculine ſpirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for
intrigue, both in politics and gallantry. This lady adviſed a vigorous
exertion of the Engliſh power againſt France, as ſhe had already marked
the Earl, her huſband, for conducting all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both in the cabinet
and the field. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced, the Queen took early meaſures to confirm her
allies, the Dutch, with aſſurances of union and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Lewis XIV, now grown familiar with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſgrace,
yet ſtill ſpurring on an exhauſted kingdom to ſecond the views of his
ambition, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the death of King William, a field open for
conqueſts and glory. The vigilance of his late rival <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0443100202:94"/> had
blaſted his laurels, and circumſcribed his power; for, even after a defeat,
William ſtill was formidable. At the news of his death therefore the French
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch could not ſuppreſs his joy, and his court at Verſailles ſeemed
to have forgotten its uſual decorum in the ſincerity of their rapture. But
their pleaſure was ſoon to determine; a much more formidable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was now
riſing up to oppoſe them; a more able warrior, one backed by the efforts of
an indulgent miſtreſs and a willing nation.</p>
            <p>Immediately, upon the Queen's acceſſion, war was declared
againſt the French King, and that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch was accuſed of attempting to
unite the crown of Spain to his own dominions, by placing his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon
the throne of that kingdom; thus attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy the equality of power
among the ſtates of Europe. This declaration was ſoon ſeconded with
vigorous efforts; an alliance was formed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Imperialiſts, the
Dutch, and the Engliſh, who contributed more to the ſupport of the war than
the other two united. Marlborough was ſent over to command the Engliſh
army, and the allies declared him generaliſſimo of all their forces. Never
was a man better calculated for debate and action than he; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene in the
midſt of danger, and cool in all the fury of battle. While his Counteſs
governed the Queen, his intrigues governed the kingdom. An indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
warrior while in camp, and a ſkilful politician in courts; he thus became the
moſt fatal enemy to France that England had produced, ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
times of Creſſy and Agincourt.</p>
            <p>This general had learned the art of war under the famous Marſhal
Turenne, having been a voluntier in his army. He, at that time, went by the
name of the <hi>Handſome Engliſhman;</hi> but Turenne foreſaw his future
greatneſs. He now gave the firſt proofs of his wiſdom by advancing the
ſubaltern officers, whoſe merit had hitherto been neglected; he gained the 
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0443100202:95"/> enemy's poſts without fighting, ever advancing, and
never loſing one advantage which he had gained. To this general was
oppoſed, on the ſide of France, the Duke of Burgundy, grandſon of the
King, a youth more qualified to grace a court, than conduct an army; the
Marſhal Bouflers commanded under him, a man of courage and activity. But
theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in both were forced to give way to the ſuperior powers of
their adverſary; after having been forced to retire by the ſkilful marches
of Marlborough, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſeen ſeveral towns taken, they gave up all
hopes of acting offenſively, and concluded the campaign with reſolutions to
proſecute the next with greater vigour.</p>
            <p>Marlborough, upon his return to London, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the rewards of his
merit, being thanked by the houſe of commons, and created a Duke by the
Queen. The ſucceſs of one campaign ever ſpurs on the Engliſh to aim at
new triumphs. Marlborough next ſeaſon returned to the field, with larger
autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and greater confidence from his former ſucceſs. He began the
campaign by taking Bonne, the reſidence of the Elector of Cologne; he next
retook Huys, Limbourg, and became maſter of all the Lower Rhine. The
Marſhal Villeroy, ſon to the King of France's governor, and educated with
him, was now general of the French army. He was ever a favourite of Lewis, had
ſhared his pleaſures and his campaigns. He was brave, virtuous, and polite;
but unequal to the great taſk of command; and ſtill more ſo, when
oppoſed to ſo great a rival.</p>
            <p>Marlborough, ſenſible of the abilities of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, was
reſolved, inſtead of immediately op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him, to fly to the ſuccour
of the Emperor, his ally, who loudly requeſted his aſſiſtance, being
preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on every ſide by a victorious enemy. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh general was
reſolved to ſtrike a vigorous blow for his relief, took with him about
thirteen thouſand <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0443100202:96"/> Engliſh troops, traverſed
extenſive countries with an haſty march, arrived at the banks of the
Danube, defeated a body of French and Bavarians ſtationed at Donavert to
oppoſe him, paſſed the Danube, and laid the Dukedom of Bavaria, that had
ſided with the French, under contribution. Villeroy, who at firſt attempted
to follow his motions, ſeemed, all at once, to have loſt ſight of his
enemy; nor was he apprized of his route, till he was informed of his
ſucceſſes.</p>
            <p>Marſhal Tallard prepared, by another route, to obſtruct the Duke
of Marlborough's retreat, with thirty thouſand men. He was ſoon after
joined by the Duke of Bavaria's forces; ſo that the French army amounted to a
body of ſixty thouſand diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined veterans, commanded by the two beſt
reputed generals at that time in France. Tallard had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his
reputation by former victories; he was active, penetrating, and had riſen by
the dint of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alone. But this ardour often roſe to impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and
he was ſo ſhort-ſighted as to be unable to diſtinguiſh at the
ſmalleſt diſtance; and the Duke was remarkable for his reſolution and
perſonal bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. On the other hand, the Duke of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough was now joined
by the Prince Eugene, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral bred up from his infancy in camps, and equal
to Marlborough in intrigue and military knowledge. Their talents were
congenial; and all their deſigns ſeemed to flow but from one ſource.
Their army, when combined, amounted to about fifty-two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men; troops
that had been accuſtomed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and had ſeen the French, the Turks,
and the Ruſſians fly before them. As this battle, both from the talents of
the generals, the improvements in the art of war, the number and diſcipline
of the troops, and the greatneſs of the contending powers, is reckoned the
moſt remarkable of this century, it demands a more particular detail.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0443100202:97"/> The French were poſted on an hill, their
right being covered by the Danube, and the village of Blenheim, and commanded
by Marſhal Tallard; their left was defended by a village, and headed by the
Elector and Marſin, an experienced French ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. In the front of their
army ran a rivulet, the banks of which were ſteep, and the bottom marſhy.
Marlborough and Eugene went together to obſerve the poſture of the French
forces. Notwithſtanding their advantageous ſituation, they were reſolved
to attack them immediately. The battle began between twelve and one in the
afternoon. Marlborough, at the head of the Engliſh troops, having paſſed
the rivulet, attacked the cavalry of Tallard in the right. This general was at
that time reviewing the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his troops in the left; and the
cavalry fought for ſome time without the preſence of their general. Prince
Eugene, on the left, had not yet attacked the forces of the Elector; and it was
an hour before he could bring his forces up to the engagement.</p>
            <p>Tallard had no ſooner underſtood that his right was attacked by
the Duke, but he flew to its head. He found a furious encounter already begun,
his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry thrice repulſed, and rallied as often. He had a large body of
forces in the village of Blenheim; he made an attempt to bring them to the
charge. They were attacked by a part of Marlborough's forces ſo vigorouſly,
that, inſtead of aſſiſting the main body, they could hardly maintain
their ground. All the French cavalry, being now attacked in flank, was totally
defeated. The Engliſh army, thus half victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, pierced up between the two
bodies of the French, commanded by the Marſhal and the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, while at the
ſame time the forces in the village of Blenheim were ſeparated by another
detachment. In this terrible ſituation Tallard flew to rally ſome
ſquadrons, but, from the weakneſs of his ſight, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking a detachment
of the enemy for his own, he <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0443100202:98"/> was taken priſoner by the
Heſſian troops, who were in Engliſh pay. In the mean time, Prince Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene
on the left, after having been thrice repulſed, put the enemy into
confuſion. The rout then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came general, and the flight precipitate. The
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation was ſuch that the French ſoldiers threw themſelves into
the Danube, without knowing where they fled. The officers loſt all their
authority; there was no general left to ſecure a retreat. The allies were now
maſters of the field of battle, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the village of Blenheim,
where a body of thirteen thouſand had been poſted in the beginning of the
action, and ſtill kept their ground. Theſe troops, ſeeing themſelves
cut off from all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the reſt of the army, threw down their
arms, and ſurrendered themſelves priſoners of war. Thus ended the battle
of Blenheim, one of the moſt complete victories that was ever obtained.
Twelve thouſand French and Bavarians were ſlain in the field, or drowned in
the Danube; thirteen thouſand were made priſoners of war. Of the allies
about five thouſand men were killed, and eight thouſand wounded or
taken.</p>
            <p>The loſs of the battle is imputed to two capital er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors committed
by Marſhal Tallard; firſt weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the center by detaching ſuch a
number of troops to the village of Blenheim, and then ſuffering the
confederates to paſs the rivulet, and form unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The next day, when
the Duke of Marlborough viſited his priſoner, the Marſhal paid him the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of having overcome the beſt troops in the world. 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I hope, Sir,</hi> replied the Duke, <hi>you will
except thoſe by whom they were conquered.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A country of an hundred leagues extent fell, by this defeat, into
the hands of the victor.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſucceeded beyond his hopes, the Duke once more
returned to England, where he found the people in a tranſport of joy; he was
welcomed as an <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0443100202:99"/> hero, who had retrieved the glory of the
nation; and the Queen, the parliament, and the people were ready to ſecond
him in all his deſigns. The manor of Woodſtock was conferred upon him for
his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and the Lord-keeper, in the name of the Peers, honoured him
with that praiſe he ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs of the laſt campaign induced the Engliſh to
increaſe their ſupplies for the next, and the Duke had fixed upon the
Moſelle for the ſcene of action; but being diſappointed by Prince Lewis,
who promiſed his aſſiſtance, he returned to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands to
oppoſe Villeroy, who, in his abſence, undertook the ſiege of Liege.
Villeroy, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived advice of the Duke's approach, abandoned his
enterprize, and retreated within his lines. Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough was reſolved to
force them. He led his troops to the charge; after a warm but ſhort
engagement the enemy's horſe were defeated with great ſlaughter. The
infantry, being abandoned, retreated in great diſorder to an advantageous
poſt, where they again drew up in order of battle. Had the Duke been
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to take advantage of their conſternation, as he propoſed, it is
poſſible he might have gained a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete victory; but he was oppoſed by
the Dutch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who repreſented it in ſuch a light to the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of
the States, that they refuſed to conſent to its execution. This timidity
was highly reſented in England, and laid the firſt foundation of
ſuſpecting the Dutch fidelity; they were ſecretly accuſed of a deſire
to protract the war, by which they alone of all the powers of Europe were
gainers.</p>
            <p>While the arms of England were crowned with ſucceſs in the
Netherlands, they were not leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in Spain, where efforts were made
to fix Charles, Duke of Auſtria, upon the throne. The greateſt part of that
kingdom had declared in favour of Philip IV, grandſon to Lewis XIV, who had 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0443100202:100"/> been nominated ſucceſſor by the late King of
Spain's will. We have already ſeen, that, by a former treaty among the powers
of Europe, Charles of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria was appointed heir to that crown; and this
treaty had been guarantied by France herſelf, who now intended to reverſe
it in favour of a deſcendant of the houſe of Bourbon. Charles, therefore
entered Spain, aſſiſted by the arms of England; and invited by the
Catalonians, who had declared in his favour. He was furniſhed with two
hundred tranſports, thirty ſhips of war, nine thouſand men, and the Earl
of Peterborough, a man of even romantic bravery, was placed at their head.</p>
            <p>One of the firſt exploits of theſe forces was to take Gibraltar,
which had hitherto been deemed impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. A ledge of lofty rocks defended it
almoſt on every ſide by land, and an open and ſtormy bay took away all
ſecurity for ſhipping by ſea. A few troops were therefore capable of
defending it againſt the moſt numerous armies. The ſecurity of the
garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon proved their ruin. A detachment of eighteen hundred marines were
landed upon that neck of level ground which joins it to the continent. Theſe
were incapable of attempting any thing effectual, and even deſtitute of hopes
of ſucceeding. A body of ſailors, in boats, were ordered to attack an
half-ruined mole; they took poſſeſſion of the platform, unterrified by
a mine that blew up an hundred men in the air; with the utmoſt intrepidity
they kept their ground, and, being ſoon joined by other ſeamen, took a
redoubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mole and the town, by ſtorm. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor was now
obliged to capitulate; and the Prince of Heſſe entered the town, amazed at
the ſucceſs of ſo deſperate an enterprize. This was a glorious and an
uſeful acquiſition to the Britiſh dominions; their trade to the
Mediterranean was thus ſecured; and they had here a repoſitory capable of
containing all <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0443100202:101"/> things neceſſary for the repairing of
fleets, or the equipment of armies.</p>
            <p>Soon after the taking this important garriſon, the Engliſh
fleet, now miſtreſs of the ſeas, attacked the French Admiral, who
commanded fifty-two ſhips of war. After an obſtinate conteſt the
Engliſh became victorious; the French fleet ſailed away, nor could it be
brought again to the engagement, though the loſſes on either ſide were
equal. This may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the final effort of France by ſea: in all
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent engagements their chief care was rather to conſult means of
eſcape than of victory. Nor yet were the French and Spaniards willing to
ſuffer Gibraltar to be taken, without an effort for repriſal. Philip ſent
an army to retake it, and France a fleet of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſhips of the line; both
were equally unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; part of the fleet was diſperſed by a
tempeſt, and another part taken by the Engliſh; while the army, having made
little or no progreſs by land, was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to abandon the enterprize.</p>
            <p>Nor were the Engliſh leſs ſucceſsful in aſſerting the
title of Charles to the kingdom. Their army was commanded by the Earl of
Peterborough, one of the moſt ſingular and extraordinary men of the age. At
fifteen he fought againſt the Moors in Africa; at twenty he aſſiſted in
compaſſing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution. He now carried on this war in Spain, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
at his own expence; and his friendſhip for the Duke Charles was his
ſtrongeſt motive to undertake it. He was deformed in perſon, but, of a
mind the moſt generous and active that ever inſpired an honeſt boſom.
His firſt attempt in Spain was to beſiege Barcelona, a ſtrong city, with
a garriſon of five thouſand men, while his own army amounted to but ſeven
thouſand. Never was an attempt more bold, or more fortunate. The operations
began by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den attack on fort Monjuice, ſtrongly ſituated on an 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0443100202:102"/> hill, that commanded the city. The outworks were taken by
ſtorm; a ſhell chanced to fall into the body of the fort, and blew up the
magazine of powder; the garriſon of the fort was ſtruck with
conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſurrendered without farther reſiſtance. The town
ſtill remained unconquered; the Engliſh general erected batteries againſt
it, and, in a few days, the governor capitulated. During the interval of
capitulation, the Germans and Catalonians in the Engliſh army had entered the
town, and were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all before them. The governor thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
betrayed: he upbraided the treachery of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Peterborough flew among
the plunderers, drove them from their prey, and returned ſoon after cooly to
finiſh the capitulation. The Spaniards were equally amazed at the
generoſity of the Engliſh, and the baſeneſs of their own countrymen,
who had led on to the ſpoil.</p>
            <p>The conqueſt of all Valencia ſucceeded the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this
important place; the enemy, after a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeated attempt to retake Barcelona,
ſaw themſelves deprived of almoſt every hope; the party of Charles was
increaſing every day; he became maſter of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Carthagena, and Granada;
the road to Madrid, their capital city, lay open before him; the Earl of
Galloway entered it in triumph, and there proclaimed Charles King of Spain,
without farther oppoſition.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh had ſcarce time to rejoice at theſe
ſucceſſes of their arms, when their attention was turned to new victories
in Flanders. The Duke of Marlborough had early commenced the campaign, and
brought an army of eighty thouſand men into the field, and ſtill expected
reinforcements from Denmark and Pruſſia. The court of France wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> reſolved to attack him before this

               </gap> thouſand men, near Tirlemont, had
orders to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gage. He accordingly drew up his forces in a ſtron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0443100202:103"/> camp; his right
was flanked by the river Mehaigne, his left was poſted behind a marſh, and
the village of Ramillies lay in the center. Marlborough, who perceived this
diſpoſition, drew up his army accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. He knew that the enemies left
could not paſs the marſh, to attack him, but at a great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; he
therefore weakened his troops on that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thundered on the center
with ſuperior num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. They ſtood but a ſhort time in the center, and,
at length, gave way on all ſides. The horſe abandoned their foot, and were
ſo cloſely purſued, that almoſt all were cut in pieces. Six thouſand
men were taken priſoners, and about eight thouſand were killed or wounded.
This victory was almoſt as ſignal as that of Blenheim; Bavaria and Cologne
were the fruits of the one, and all Brabant was gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the other. The
French troops were diſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the city of Paris overwhelmed with
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation. Lewis XIV, who, in the beginning of his reign, had long been
flattered with conqueſt, was now humbled to ſuch a degree as might have
excited the compaſſion of his enemies; he intreated for peace, but in vain;
the allies carried all before them; and his very capital dreaded the approach
of the conquerors. What neither his power, his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor his politics, could
effect, a party in England performed; and the diſſention between the Whigs
and the Tories ſaved the dominions of France, that now ſeemed ready for
ruin.</p>

            <p>QUEEN Anne's councils had hitherto been governed by a Whig
miniſtry; they ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the ſchemes of the late King; and, upon
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican principles, ſtrove to diffuſe freedom through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0443100202:104"/> Europe. In a government, where the reaſoning of
individuals, retired from power, generally leads thoſe who command, the
deſigns of the miniſtry muſt change, as the people happen to alter. The
Queen's perſonal virtues, her ſucceſſes, her adulation from the throne,
contributed all to change the diſpoſition of the nation; they now began to
defend hereditary ſucceſſion, non-reſiſtance, and divine right; they
were now become Tories, and were ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert the deſigns of a Whig
miniſtry, whenever a leader offered to conduct them to the charge.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſcontents were, in ſome meaſure, increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a
meditated union between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland. The treaty,
for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was chiefly managed by the miniſtry; and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it
was fraught with numberleſs benefits to either kingdom, yet it raiſed the
murmurs of both. The Engliſh expected nothing from the union of ſo poor a
nation, but a participation of their neceſſities; they thought it unjuſt,
that, while Seotland was granted an eighth part of the legiſlature, it yet
ſhould be taxed but a fortieth part of the ſupplies. On the other hand, the
Scotch conſidered that their independency would be quite deſtroyed, and the
dignity of their crown betrayed; they dreaded an increaſe of taxes, and
ſeemed not much to eſteem the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of an increaſed trade. In every
political meaſure there are diſadvantages on either ſide, which may be
ſufficient to deter the timid, but which a bold legiſlator diſregards.
The union, after ſome ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, was effected; Scotland was no longer to
have a parliament, but to ſend ſixteen Peers, choſen from the body of
their nobility, and forty-five commoners. The two kingdoms were called by the
common name of Great Britain; and all the ſubjects of both were to enjoy a
commun iation of privileges and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0443100202:105"/> This meaſure, which ſtrengthened the
vigour of government, by uniting its force, ſeemed to threaten the enemies of
Great Britain with dangers abroad; but the diſcontents of the nation at home
prevented the effects of its newly-acquired power. The To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, now become the
majority, were diſpleaſed with the Whig miniſtry; they looked with
jealouſy on the power of the Earl of Godolphin and the Duke of Marlborough,
who had long governed the Queen, and laviſhed the treaſures of the nation
on conqueſts more glorious than ſerviceable. To them the people imputed the
burthens under which they now groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and others which they had reaſon to
fear. The loſs of a battle near Almanza in Spain, where the Engliſh army
were taken priſoners, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Earl of Galloway, with ſome
other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, tended to heighten their diſpleaſure, and
diſpelled the inebriation of former ſucceſs. The To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries did not fail to
inculcate and exaggerate theſe cauſes of diſcontent, while Robert Harley,
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Earl of Oxford, and Henry St. John, made ſoon after Lord
Bolingbroke, ſecretly fanned the flame.</p>
            <p>Harley had lately become a favourite of the Queen; the petulance of
the Ducheſs of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, who formerly ruled the Queen, had entirely
alienated the affections of her miſtreſs. She now placed them upon one Mrs.
Maſham, who was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to Lord Oxford. Oxford was
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of uncommon erudition; he was polite and intriguing; he had
inſinuated himſelf into the royal favour, and determined to ſap the
credit of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough and his adherents. In this attempt he choſe, for his
ſecond, Bolingbroke, a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted powers of thinking, eloquent,
ambitious, and enterpriſing. Bolingbroke was, at firſt, contented to act a
ſubordinate character in this meditated oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tion; but, ſoon perceiving the ſuperiority of his 
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0443100202:106"/> own talents, from being an inferior, he was reſolved
to become Lord Oxford's rival. The Duke of Marlborough ſoon perceived their
growing power, and reſolved to cruſh it in the beginning. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to
join in the Privy Council, while Harley was ſecretary. Godolphin joined his
influence in this meaſure; and the Queen was obliged to appeaſe their
reſentment, by diſcharging Harley from his place: Bolingbroke was
reſolved to ſhare his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and voluntarily relinquiſhed his
employments.</p>
            <p>This violent meaſure, which ſeemed, at firſt, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to
the Whig miniſtry, laid the firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its ruin; the Queen was
intirely diſpleaſed with the haughty conduct of the Duke; and, from that
moment, he loſt her confidence and affection. Harley was enabled to act now
with leſs diſguiſe, and to take more vigorous meaſures for the
completion of his deſigns. In him the Queen repoſed all her truſt, though
he now had no viſible concern in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.</p>
            <p>The Whig party, in this manner, ſeemed to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph for ſome
time, till an occurrence, in itſelf, of no great importance, ſerved to
ſhew the ſpirit of the times. Doctor Sacheverel, a miniſter of narrow
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects and bigotted principles, had publiſhed two ſermons, in which he
ſtrongly inſiſted on the illega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of reſiſting Kings, and enforced
the divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of their authority; declaimed againſt the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and exhorted the Church to put on the whole armour of God. There was nothing in
the ſermons, either nervous, well written, or clear; they owed all their
celebrity to the complexion of the times, and are at preſent juſtly
forgotten. Sacheverel was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached by the commons, at the bar of the upper
houſe; they ſeemed reſolutely bent upon puniſhing him; and a day was
appointed for trying him before the Lords at Weſtminſter-Hall. Mean while,
the Tories, who, one and all, approved his principles, <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0443100202:107"/>
were as violent in his defence as the parliament had been in his proſecution.
The eyes of the kingdom were turned upon this extraordinary tryal; the Queen
herſelf was every day preſent as a private ſpectator. His tryal laſted
ſome days; and vaſt multitudes attended him each day, as he went to the
hall, ſhouting, and praying for his ſucceſs. The body of the people
eſpouſed his cauſe. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed ſeveral meeting-houſes, and
plundered the dwellings of Diſſenters; and the Queen herſelf could not
but reliſh thoſe doctrines which contributed to extend her prerogative. The
Lords were divided; they continued undetermined for ſome time; but, at
length, after much obſtinate diſpute and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent altercation, Sacheverel
was found guilty by a majority of ſeventeen voices. He was prohibited from
preaching, for the term of three years: his two ſermons were ordered to be
burnt by the hands of the common hangman. The lenity of this ſentence was
conſidered, by the Tories, as a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and, in fact, their faction took
the lead all the remaining part of this reign.</p>
            <p>The King of France, long perſecuted by fortune, and each hour
fearing for his capital, once more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for peace. Godolphin and
Marlborough, who had, ſince the beginning of the war, enjoyed the double
advantage of extending their glory, and increaſing their fortunes, were
intirely averſe to any negotiation which tended to diminiſh both. The
Tories, on the other hand, willing to humble the general, and his partner
Godolphin, were ſincerely deſirous of a peace, as the only meaſure to
attain their ends. A conference was, at length, begun at Gertruydenberg, under
the influence of Marlborough, Eugene, and Zinzendorf, all three entirely
averſe to the treaty. The French miniſters were ſubjected to every
ſpecies of mortification; their conduct nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly watched; their maſter
inſulted; and their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0443100202:108"/> opened. They offered to
ſatisfy every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that had given riſe to the war; they conſented
to abandon Philip IV, in Spain; to grant the Dutch a large barrier; they even
conſented to grant a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply towards dethroning Philip; but even this offer
was treated with contempt, and at length the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was broken off, while
Lewis reſolved to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard another campaign.</p>
            <p>The deſigns of the Dutch, and the Engliſh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, were too
obvious not to be ſeen, and properly explained by their enemies in England.
The writers of the Tory faction, who were men of the firſt rank of literary
merit, diſplayed the avarice of the Duke and the ſelf-intereſted conduct
of the Dutch; they inſiſted, that, while England was exhauſting her
ſtrength in foreign conqueſts, ſhe was loſing her liberty at home; that
her miniſters were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with ſharing the plunder of an
impoveriſhing ſtate, but were reſolved upon deſtroying its liberties
alſo. To theſe complaints were added the real pride of the then prevailing
miniſtry, and the inſolence of the Ducheſs of Marlborough, who hitherto
had poſſeſſed more real power than the whole privy-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil united.
Mrs. Maſham, who had firſt been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the Queen's favour by the
Ducheſs, now fairly ſupplanted her patroneſs; and, by a ſteady
attention to pleaſe the Queen, had gained all that confidence which ſhe had
repoſed in her former confidante. It was too late that the Ducheſs
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this alienation of the Queen's favour, and now began to think of
repairing it by demanding an audience of her Majeſty, in order to vindicate
her character from every ſuſpicion; but formal expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ever widen the
breach.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hill, brother to the new favourite, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Queen
to be colonel of a regiment; this the Duke of Marlborough could by no means
approve. He expoſtulated with his ſovereign; he <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0443100202:109"/>
retired in diſguſt; the Queen, by a letter, gave him
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eave to diſpoſe of the
regiment as he ſhould think proper; but, before it came to his hands, he had
ſent a letter to the Queen, deſiring ſhe would permit him to retire from
his employments. This was the conjuncture which the Tories had long wiſhed
for, and which the Queen herſelf was internally pleaſed with. She now
perceived herſelf ſet free from an arbitrary combination, by which ſhe
had been long kept in dependance. The Earl of Godolphin, the Duke's
ſon-in-law, was diveſted of his office; and the treaſury ſubmitted to
Harley, the antagoniſt of his ambition. Lord Somers was diſmiſſed from
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſident of the council, and the Earl of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter appointed in
his room. In a word, there was not one Whig left in any office of ſtate,
except the Duke of Marlborough; he retained his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a ſhort
time, unſupported and alone, an object of envy and factious reproach, till at
length be found his cauſe irretrievable, and was obliged, after trying
another campaign, to reſign, as the reſt of his party had done before.</p>
            <p>As war ſeemed to have been the deſire of the Whig party, ſo
peace ſeemed to have been that of the Tories. Through the courſe of
Engliſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, France ſeems to have been the peculiar object of the
hatred of the Whigs, and a continual war with that nation has been their aim.
On the contrary, the Tories have not regarded that nation, with ſuch
oppoſition of principle; and a peace with France has generally been the
reſult of a Tory adminiſtration. For ſome time therefore, a negotiation
for peace had been carried on between the court of France and the new
miniſters, who had a double aim in this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; namely, to mortify the
Whigs and the Dutch, and to free their country from a ruinous war which had all
the appearance of becoming habitual to the conſtitution.</p>

            <head>LETTER XIII.</head>
            <p>THE conferences for peace were firſt opened at London; and ſome
time after the Queen ſent the Earl of Strafford as ambaſſador into
Holland, to communicate the propoſals which the French King had made towards
the re-eſtabliſhment of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tranquility. The ſpirit of the times
was now changed; Marlborough's averſion to ſuch meaſures could now no
longer retard the negotiation; Lord Strafford obliged the Dutch to name
plenipotentiaries, and to receive thoſe of France. The treaty began at
Utrecht; but as all the powers concerned in this conference, except France and
England, were averſe to every accommodation, their diſputes ſerved rather
to retard than accelerate a pacification. The Engliſh miniſtry, however,
had foreſeen and provided againſt thoſe difficulties. Their great end was
to free the ſubjects from a long unprofitable war, a war where conqueſt
could add nothing to their power, and a defeat might be prejudicial to internal
tranquility. As England had borne the chief burthen of the war, it was but
juſt to expect that it would take the lead in dictating the terms of peace.
There were, however, three perſons of very great intereſt and power, who
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, by every art, to protract the negotiation; thoſe were the Duke of
Marlborough, Prince Eugene, and Heinſius the Dutch grand penſionary. Prince
Eugene even came over to London, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the progreſs of a peace,
which ſeemed to interrupt his career of glory; he found at court ſuch a
recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as was due to his merits and fame; but, at the ſame time, ſuch a
repulſe as the propoſals he made ſeemed to deſerve.</p>
            <p>This negotiation to London failing of effect, the allies practiſed
every artifice to intimidate the Queen, and blacken the character of her
miniſters; to raiſe <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0443100202:111"/> and continue a dangerous ferment
among the people, to obſtruct her councils, and divulge her deſigns. Her
miniſters were very ſenſible of their preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſituation;
they perceived her health was daily impairing, and her ſucceſſor
countenanced the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite faction. In caſe of her death, they had nothing
to expect but proſecution and ruin, for obeying her commands; their only way
therefore was to give up their preſent employments, or haſten the
conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a treaty, the utility of which would be the beſt argument
with the people in their favour. The peace therefore was haſtened; and this
haſte, in ſome meaſure, relaxed the miniſters obſtinacy, in
inſiſting upon ſuch terms and advantages as they had a right to demand.
Seeing that nothing was to be expected from the concurrence of the allies, the
courts of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Verſailles reſolved to enter into a private treaty,
in which ſuch terms might be agreed on as would enable both courts to
preſcribe terms to the reſt of the contending powers.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Duke of Marlborough having been depoſed from
his office of general, the command of the Engliſh army in Flanders was given
to the Duke of Ormond; but, at the ſame time, private orders were given him
not to act with vigour againſt an enemy, which was upon the point of being
recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by more mild methods of treatment. The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, thus deprived of
the aſſiſtance of the Engliſh, ſtill continued their animoſity, and
were reſolved to continue the war ſeparately; they had the utmoſt
confidence in Prince Eugene, their general; and, though leſſened by the
defection of the Britiſh forces, they were ſtill ſuperior to thoſe of
the enemy, which were commanded by Marſhal Villars, a man who ſeemed to
poſſeſs all the great qualities, and all the ſoibles of his country, in
a ſupreme degree; valiant, generous, alert, lively, boaſtful, and
avaricious. The loſs of the Britiſh forces was ſoon ſeverely felt in
the <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0443100202:112"/> allied army. Villars attacked a ſeparate body of
their troops incamped at Denain, under the command of the Earl of Albemarle.
Their intrenchments were forced, and ſeventeen battalions either killed or
taken, the Earl himſelf, and all the ſurviving officers, being made
priſoners of war.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſucceſſes of Marſhal Villars ſerved to haſten
the treaty of Utrecht. The Britiſh miniſters at the congreſs,
reſponſible at once for their conduct to their Queen, their country, and
all Europe, neglected nothing that might have been ſerviceable either to the
allies, or that might conduce to the public ſafety. They firſt ſtipulated
that Philip V, who had been ſettled on the throne of Spain, ſhould renounce
all right to the crown of France, the union of two ſuch powerful kingdoms
being thought dangerous to the liberties of the reſt of Europe. They
covenanted that the Duke of Berry, his brother, the preſumptive heir to the
crown of France, after the death of the Dauphin, ſhould alſo renounce his
right to the crown of Spain, in caſe he became King of France. The Duke of
Orleans was to make the ſame reſignation. To oblige men thus to renounce
their rights might have been injuſtice; but, for every good acquired, ſome
inconvenience muſt be endured; theſe reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in ſome meaſure,
ſerved to calm the world temptſted up by long war, and have ſince become
the baſis of the law of nations, to which Europe profeſſes preſent
ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>By this treaty the Duke of Savoy had the iſland of Sicily, with
the title of King, with Feneſtrelles, and other places on the continent;
which increaſe of his power ſeemed, in ſome meaſure, drawn from the
ſpoils of the French monarchy. The Dutch had that barrier granted them, which
they ſo long ſought after; and, if the houſe of Bourbon ſeemed
ſtripped of ſome dominion, in order to enrich the Duke of Savoy, on the
other hand, the houſe of Auſtria was <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0443100202:113"/> taxed to
ſupply the wants of the Hollanders, who were put in poſſeſſion of the
ſtrongeſt towns in Flanders. With regard to England, its glory and
intereſts were ſecured. They cauſed the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Dunkirk to be
demoliſhed, and its port to be deſtroyed. Spain gave up all right to
Gibraltar and the iſland of Minorca. France reſigned Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's-Bay,
Nova-Scotia, and Newfoundland; but they were left in poſſeſſion of
Cape-Breton, and the liberty of drying their fiſh upon the ſhore. Among the
articles which were glorious to the Engliſh, it may be obſerved, that the
ſetting free thoſe who had been confined in the French priſons for
profeſſing the Proteſtant religion, was not the leaſt. It was
ſtipulated, that the Emperor ſhould poſſeſs the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Naples,
the Duchy of Milan, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Netherlands; that the King of
Pruſſia ſhould have Upper Gueldre; and a time was fixed for the Emperor's
acceding to theſe reſolutions, for he had hitherto obſtinately refuſed
to aſſiſt at the negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus it appears, that the Engliſh
miniſtry did juſtice to all the world; but their country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it to
them; they were branded with all the terms of infamy and reproach by the Whig
party, and accuſed of having given up the privileges and rights which England
had to expect. Each party reviled the other in turn; the kingdom was divided
into oppoſite factions, both ſo violent in their cauſe, that the truth,
which both pretended to eſpouſe, was attained by neither; both were
virulent, and both wrong. Theſe commotions, in ſome meaſure, ſerved
ſtill more to impair the Queen's health. One fit of ſickneſs ſucceeded
another; nor did the conſolation of her miniſtry ſerve to allay her
anxieties; for they now had fallen out among themſelves, the council-chamber
being turned into a theatre for the moſt bitter altercations. Oxford
adviſed a reconciliation with the Whigs, whoſe reſentment he now began to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0443100202:114"/> fear, as the Queen's health appeared to be impaired.
Bolingbroke, on the other hand, affected to ſet the Whigs at defiance;
profeſſed a warm zeal for the church, and mixed flattery with his other
aſſiduities. Bolingbroke prevailed; Lord Oxford, the treaſurer, was
removed from his employment, and retired, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating ſchemes of revenge, or
new projects for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture re-eſtabliſhment. His fall was ſo ſudden, and
ſo unexpected, that no plan was eſtabliſhed for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the vacancy
occaſioned by his diſgrace. All was confuſion at court; and the Queen had
no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger force to ſupport the burthen; ſhe ſunk into a ſtate of
inſenſibility, and thus found refuge from anxiety in lethargic ſlumber.
Every method was contrived to rouze her from this ſtate, but in vain; her
phyſicians diſpaired of her life. The privy-council aſſembled upon this
occaſion; the Dukes of Somerſet and Argyle, being informed of the
deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate in which ſhe lay, entered that aſſembly without
being ſummoned; the members were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at their appearance; but the
Duke of Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury thanked them for their readineſs to give their
aſſiſtance at ſuch a critical juncture, and deſired them to take
their places. They now took all the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary precautions for ſecuring
the ſucceſſion in the houſe of Hanover, ſent orders to the Heralds at
Arms, and to a troop of life-guards to be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to mount, in order to
proclaim the Elector of Brunſwick King of Great Britain.</p>
            <p>On the thirtieth of July the Queen ſeemed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what relieved by
medicines, roſe from her bed, and, about eight, walked a little; when,
caſting her eyes on the clock that ſtood in her chamber, ſhe continued to
gaze for ſome time. One of the ladies in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked her what ſhe ſaw
there more than uſual? to which the Queen only anſwered by turning her eyes
upon her with a dying look. She was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeized with a fit of the
apoplexy, from which, <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0443100202:115"/> however, ſhe was relieved by the
aſſiſtance of Doctor Mead. In this ſtate of ſtupefaction ſhe
continued all night; ſhe gave ſome ſigns of life between twelve and one
next day, but expired the next morning, a little after ſeven o'clock, having
lived forty-nine years five months and ſix days; and having reigned more than
twelve years with honour, equity, and applauſe. This Princeſs was rather
amiable than great, rather pleaſing than beautiful; neither her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity nor
learning were remarkable. Like all thoſe of her family, ſhe ſeemed rather
fitted for the private duties of life than a public ſtation; a pattern of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal affection, a good mother, a warm friend, and an indulgent
miſtreſs. During her reign none ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on the ſcaffold for
treaſon; ſo that after a long ſucceſſion of faulty or cruel Kings,
ſhe ſhines with particular luſtre. In her ended the line of the
Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts; a family, the misfortunes and miſconducts of which are not to be
paralleled in hiſtory; a family who, leſs than men themſelves, ſeemed
to expect from their followers more than manhood in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; a family
demanding rather our pity than aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, who never rewarded their
friends, nor aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of their enemies.</p>

            <p>THE nearer we approach to our own times, in this ſurvey of
Engliſh hiſtory, the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant every occurrence becomes; our own
intereſts are blended with thoſe of the ſtate; and the accounts of public
welfare are but the tranſcript of private happineſs. The two parties which
had long divided the kingdom, under the names of Whig and Tory, now ſeemed to
alter their titles; the Whigs being <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0443100202:116"/> ſtyled
Hanoverians, and the Tories branded with the appellation of Jacobites. The
former, deſired to be governed by a King, who was a Proteſtant, though a
foreigner; the latter, by a Monarch of their own country, though a Papiſt. Of
two inconveniencies, however, that ſeemed the leaſt, where religion
ſeemed to be in no danger; and the Hanoverians prevailed.</p>
            <p>The Jacobites had been long flattered with the hopes of ſeeing the
ſucceſſion altered by the Earl of Oxford; but by the premature death of
the Queen, all their expectations at once were blaſted; the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and
activity of the privy-council, in which the Hanoverian intereſt prevailed,
completed their confuſion, and they now found themſelves without any leader
to give conſiſtency to their deſigns, and force to their councils. Upon
recollection they ſaw nothing ſo eligible as ſilence and
ſubmiſſion; they hoped much from the aſſiſtance of France, and
ſtill more from the vigour of the pretender.</p>
            <p>Purſuant to the act of ſucceſſion. George I, ſon of
Erneſt Auguſtus, firſt Elector of Brunſwick, and Sophia, grand-daughter
to James I, aſcended the Britiſh throne. His mature age, being now
fifty-four years old; his ſagacity and experience, his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous alliances,
the general peace of Europe; all contributed to his ſupport, and promiſed a
peaceable and happy reign. His virtues, though not ſhining, were ſolid; he
was of a very different diſpoſition from the Stewart family, whom he
ſucceeded; they were known to a proverb for leaving their friends in
diſtreſs; George, on the contrary, ſoon after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in England,
uſed to ſay, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>My maxim is never to abandon my friends; to do
juſtice to all the world; and to fear no man.</hi>
               </q> To theſe
qualifications he joined great application to buſineſs; but generally
ſtudied more the intereſts of thoſe ſubjects he had left behind, than
of theſe he came to govern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0443100202:117"/> The King firſt landed at Greenwich, where
he was received by the Duke of Northumberland, and the Lords of the regency.
From the landing-place he walked to his houſe in the Park, accompanied by a
great number of the nobility, and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of diſtinction, who had
the honour to kiſs his hand, as they approached. When he retired to his
bed-chamber, he ſent for thoſe of the nobility who had diſtinguiſhed
themſelves by their zeal for his ſucceſſion; but the Duke of Ormond,
the Lord Chancellor, and Lord Trevor, were not of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; Lord Oxford too,
the next morning, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with marks of diſapprobation; and none but
the Whig party were admitted into any ſhare of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. The King of a
faction is but the ſovereign of half his ſubjects; of this, however, the
Monarch I ſpeak of did not ſeem ſenſible; it was his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as
well as that of the nation, that he was hemmed round by men who ſoured him
with all their intereſts and prejudices; none now but the violent in faction
were admitted into employment; and the Whigs, while they pretended to ſecure
for him the crown, were, with all poſſible diligence, abridging the
prerogative. An inſtantaneous and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal change was effected in all offices
of honour and advantage. The Whigs governed the ſenate, and the court
diſpoſed of all places at pleaſure; whom they would they oppreſſed;
bound the lower orders of people with new and ſevere laws; and this they
called liberty.</p>
            <p>Theſe partialities, and this oppreſſion, ſoon raiſed
diſcontents throughout the kingdom. The clamour of the church's being in
danger was revived; jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies were received, and dangerous tumults raiſed
in every part of the country. The party cry was, Down with the Whigs;
Sacheveral for ever. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe commotions in the Pretender's favour, this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0443100202:118"/> Prince himſelf continued only a calm ſpectator on
the continent, now and then ſending over his emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to inflame the
diſturbances, to diſperſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual manifeſtoes, and to delude
the unwary. Copies of a printed addreſs were ſent to the Dukes of
Shrewſbury, Marlborough, Argyle, and other noblemen of the firſt
diſtinction, vindicating the Pretender's right to the crown, and complaining
of the injuſtice that was done him by receiving a foreigner. Yet, for all
this, he ſtill continued to profeſs the trueſt regard for the Catholic
religion; and, inſtead of concealing his ſentiments on that head, gloried
in his principles. It was the being a Papiſt which had diſpoſſeſſed
his father of the throne; and ſurely the ſon could never hope to gain a
crown by the very methods in which it was loſt; but an infatuation ſeemed
for ever to attend all the family.</p>
            <p>However odious, at that time, the Popiſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions were
to the people in general, yet the opinions of the Diſſenters ſeemed
ſtill more diſpleaſing. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was mingled with all political
diſputes. The High-church party complained, that, under a Whig
adminiſtration, impiety and hereſy daily gained ground; that the prelates
were at once negligent of religious concerns, and warm in purſuit of
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings. A book written by Doctor Samuel Clarke, in favour of
Socinianiſm, was ſtrictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; the diſputes among the Churchmen
roſe to ſuch a height that the miniſtry was obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe; and
the clergy received orders for finiſhing ſuch-like debates, and from
intermeddling in affairs of ſtate. Nothing, however, can be more impolitic in
a ſtate, than to prohibit the clergy from diſputing with each other; by
this means they become more animated in the cauſe of religion; and which ever
ſide they defend, they become wiſer and better, as they carry on the
cauſe. To ſilence their diſputes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to lead them into negligence; if
religion be not <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0443100202:119"/> kept up by oppoſition, it falls to the
ground, no longer becomes an object of public concern. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I ſay
again, ſhould never ſilence diſpute, and ſhould never ſide with
either diſputant.</p>
            <p>A new parliament was now called, in which the Whigs had by far the
majority; all prepoſſeſſed with the ſtrongeſt averſion to the
Tories, and led on by the King himſelf, who made no ſecret of his
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Upon their firſt meeting he informed them, that the
branches of the revenue granted for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of civil government, were
not ſufficient for that purpoſe; he apprized them of the machinations of
the Pretender, and intimated that he expected their aſſiſtance in
puniſhing ſuch as had endeavoured to deprive him of that bleſſing which
he moſt valued, the affection of his people. As the houſes were then
diſpoſed, this ſerved to give them the alarm; and they out-went even the
moſt ſanguine expectations of the moſt vindictive miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Their reſentment began with arraigning Lord Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingbroke of high
treaſon, and other high crimes and miſdemeanors. To this it was objected by
one of the members of the houſe of commons, that nothing in the allegations
laid to his charge amounted to high treaſon. To this there was no reply
given; but, Lord Coningſby ſtanding up, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>The chairman,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>has impeached
the hand, but I impeach the head; he has impeached the ſcholar, and I the
maſter. I impeach Robert Earl of Oxford, and Earl Mortimer, of high treaſon
and other crimes and miſdemeanors.</hi>
               </q> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this nobleman
appeared the next day in the houſe of Lords, he was avoided, by his brother
Peers, as infectious; he, whoſe favour had been but a little before ſo
earneſtly ſought after, was now rejected and contemned. When the articles
were read againſt him in the houſe of Peers, ſome debates aroſe as to
the nature of his indictment, which, however, were carried by his
adverſaries, and the articles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0443100202:120"/> approved
by the houſe; he was therefore again impeached at the bar of the houſe of
Lords; and a motion was made that he might loſe his ſeat, and be committed
to cloſe cuſtody. The Earl now ſeeing a furious ſpirit of faction
raiſed againſt him, and aiming at his head, was not wanting to himſelf,
upon this emergency, but ſpoke to the following purpoſe: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I am accuſed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for having
made a peace; a peace, which, bad as it is now repreſented, has been approved
by two ſucceſſive parliaments. For my own part, I always acted by the
immediate directions and commands of the Queen my miſtreſs, and never
offended againſt any known law. I am juſtified in my own conſcience, and
unconcerned for the life of an inſignificant old man. But I cannot, without

obligation binds me to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate her memory. My Lords, if miniſters of
ſtate, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the immediate commands of their Sovereign, are afterwards
to be made accountable for their proceedings, it may, one day or other, be the
caſe of all the members of this auguſt aſſembly. I do not doubt
therefore, that, out of regard to yourſelves, your Lordſhips will give me
an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table hearing; and I hope, that in the proſecution of this inquiry it
will appear, that I have merited, not only the indulgence, but alſo the
favour of this government. My Lords, I am now to take my leave of your
Lordſhips, and of this honourable houſe, perhaps, for ever! I ſhall lay
down my life with pleaſure, in a cauſe favoured by my late dear royal
miſtreſs. And, when I conſider that I am to be judged by the juſtice,
honour, and virtue of my Peers, I ſhall acquieſce, and retire with great
content. And, my Lords, God's will be done.</hi>
               </q> On his return from the
houſe of Lords to his own houſe, where he was, for that night, permitted to
go, he was followed by a great multitude of people, crying out, High-church
Ormond and Oxford for ever. Next day he was brought to the bar, where he
received a copy of his articles, and was allowed a month to prepare his
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0443100202:121"/> Though Doctor Mead declared, that if the Earl
ſhould be ſent to the Tower, his life would be in danger, it was carried,
that he ſhould be ſent there, whither he was attended by a prodigious
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people, who did not ſcruple to exclaim againſt his
proſecutors. Tumults grew more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; and this only ſerved to
increaſe the ſeverity of the legiſlature. An act was made, decreeing,
that if any perſons, to the number of twelve, unlawfully aſſembled,
ſhould continue together one hour, after being required to diſperſe by a
Juſtice of Peace, or other officer, and heard the proclamation againſt
riots read in public, they ſhould be deemed guilty of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, without
benefit of the clergy. An act of this kind carries its own comment with it;
legiſlators ſhould ever be averſe to enacting ſuch laws as leave the
greateſt room for abuſe.</p>
            <p>A committee was now appointed to draw up ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of impeachment,
and prepare evidence againſt him and the other impeached Lords; he was
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the Tower, and there remained for two years; during which time,
the kingdom was in a continual ferment, ſeveral other Lords, who had broke
out into actual rebellion, and were taken in arms, being executed for
treaſon; the miniſtry ſeemed weary of executions; and he, with his
uſual fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, preſented, upon this occaſion, a petition for coming
to his tryal. A day was therefore aſſigned him. The commons appointed a
committee to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the ſtate of the Earl's impeachment, and demanded
a longer time to prepare for the tryal. The truth is, they had now began to
relax in their former aſperity; and the intoxication of party was not quite
ſo ſtrong now as when he had been firſt committed. At the appointed time
the Peers repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the court in Weſtminſter-Hall, where Lord Cowper
preſided as Lord Steward. The commons were aſſembled; and the King and
royal family aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0443100202:122"/> at the ſolemnity. The
priſoner was brought from the Tower, and his articles of impeachment read,
with his anſwers and the replies of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Sir Joſeph Jekyl, one of
the agents for the commons, ſtanding up to enforce the firſt article of his
Lordſhip's accuſation, one of the Lords adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the houſe,
obſerved, that much time would be conſumed in going through all the
articles of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment; that nothing more remained than for the commons
to make good the two articles of high treaſon contained in his charge; and
that this would at once determine the tryal. His advice was agreed to by the
Lords; but the commons delivered a paper containing their reaſons for
aſſerting it as their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to carry on the impeachment in the
manner they thought moſt conducive to their aim. On the other hand, the
houſe of Lords inſiſted on their former reſolution, conſidering it as
the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of every judge to hear each cauſe in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he thinks
moſt fitting. The diſpute grew ſtill more violent; a meſſage was at
length ſent to the commons, intimating that the Lords intended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
immediately to the Earl of Oxford's tryal; and, ſoon after repairing to the
Hall of Juſtice, they took their places. The commons, however, did not think
fit to appear; and the Earl, having waited a quarter of an hour at the bar, was
diſmiſſed for want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers. To this diſpute, perhaps, he owed

Scotland the diſcontent broke forth, at length, into the flames of rebellion.
The Earl of Mar, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling three hundred of his own vaſſals, in the
Highlands of Scotland, proclaimed the Pretender at Caſtletown, and ſet up
his ſtandard at Brae Mar, on the ſixth day of September, then aſſuming
the title of Lieutenant-general of the Pretender's forces; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the
people to take arms in defence of their lawful Sovereign. But theſe
preparations were weak and ill-conducted; all the deſigns of the rebels
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed to the government, the beginning of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt repreſſed, the
weſtern counties prevented from riſing, and the moſt prudent precautions
taken to keep all ſuſpected perſons in cuſtody, or in awe. The Earl of
Derwentwater, and Mr. Foſter, took the field near the borders of Scotland;
and, being joined by ſome gentlemen, proclaimed the Pretender. Their firſt
attempt was to ſeize upon Newcaſtle, in which they had many friends; but
they found the gates ſhut upon them, and were obliged to retire to Hexam;
while General Carpenter, having aſſembled a body of dragoons, reſolved to
attack them before their numbers were increaſed. The rebels had two methods
of acting with ſucceſs; either marching immediately into the weſtern
parts of Scotland, and there joining General Gordon, who commanded a ſtrong
body of Highlanders; or of croſſing the Tweed, and attacking General
Carpenter, whoſe forces did not exceed nine hundred men. From their uſual
infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation neither of theſe ſchemes were put into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; for, taking
the route another way, they left General Carpenter on one ſide, and
reſolved to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into England by the weſtern border. They accordingly
advanced without either foreſight or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as far as Preſton, where
they firſt heard the news that General Wills was marching at the head of
ſix regiments of horſe, and a battalion of foot, to attack them. They now
therefore began to raiſe <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0443100202:124"/> barricadoes, and to put the
place in a poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, repulſing at firſt the attack of the
King's army with ſome ſucceſs. Next day, however, General Wills was
reinforced by the troops under Carpenter, and the rebels were inveſted on all
ſides. Foſter, their General, ſent Colonel Oxburgh with a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to the
Engliſh commander, to propoſe a capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. This, however, General Wills
refuſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that he would not treat with rebels; and that all they
could expect was, to be ſpared from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſlaughter. Theſe were hard
terms; but they were then obliged to ſubmit. They accordingly laid down their
arms, and were put under a ſtrong guard. The leaders were ſecured, and led
through London pinioned, and bound together, while the common men were confined
at Cheſter and Liverpool.</p>
            <p>While theſe unhappy circumſtances attended the rebels in
England, the Earl of Mar's forces, in the mean time, increaſed to the number
of ten thouſand men, and he had made himſelf maſter of the whole county
of Fife. Againſt him the Duke of Argyle ſet out for Scotland, as commander
in chief of the forces in North Britain; and, aſſembling ſome troops in
Lothian, returned to Stirling with all poſſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. The Earl of
Mar, being informed of this, at firſt retreated; but being joined ſoon
after by ſome Clans under the Earl of Seaforth, and others by General Gordon,
who had ſignalized himſelf in the Ruſſian ſervice, he reſolved to
march forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards England. The Duke of Argyle, apprized of his intention,
and being joined by ſome regiments of dragoons from Ireland, determined to
give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dumblain, though his forces were by no
means ſo numerous as thoſe of the rebel army. In the morning therefore of
the ſame day on which the Preſton rebels had ſurrendered, he drew up his
forces, which did not exceed three thouſand five hundred men, but found
himſelf greatly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flanked <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0443100202:125"/> by the enemy. The Duke
therefore perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy making attempts to ſurround him, was obliged
to alter his diſpoſition; which, on account of the ſcarcity of general
officers, was not done ſo expeditiouſly as to be all formed before the
rebels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the attack. The left wing therefore of the Duke's army fell in
with the center of the enemy's, and ſupported the firſt charge without
ſhrinking. This wing even ſeemed, for a ſhort time, victorious, as they
killed the chief leader of part of the rebel army. But Glengary, who was
ſecond in command, undertook to inſpire his intimidated forces; and, waving
his bonnet, cried out ſeveral times, Revenge. This animated his men to ſuch
a degree, that they followed him cloſe to the muzzles of the muſkets,
puſhed aſide the bayonets with their targets, and with their broad-ſwords
did great execution. A total route of that wing of the royal army enſued, and
General Witham, their commander, flying full ſpeed to Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, gave out,
that all was loſt. In the mean time the Duke of Argyle, who commanded in
perſon on the right, attacked the left of the enemy, and drove them before
him for two miles, though they often faced about, and attempted to rally. The
Duke having thus entirely broke their left, and puſhed them over the river
Allen, returned to the field, where they found that part of the rebel army
which had been victorious; but, inſtead of renewing the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both
armies continued to gaze at each other, neither caring to engage; till towards
evening both ſides drew off, each boaſting of victory. Which ever might
claim the triumph, it muſt be owned, that all the honour, and all the
advantages of the day, belonged only to the Duke of Argyle. It was ſufficient
for him to have interrupted the enemies progreſs; and delay was to them a
defeat. The Earl of Mar therefore ſoon found his diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and
loſſes increaſe. The caſtle of Inverneſs, <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0443100202:126"/> of
which he was in poſſeſſion, was delivered up to the King by Lord Lovat,
who had hitherto appeared in the intereſt of the Pretender. The Marquis of
Tullibardine left the Earl to defend his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and many of the Clans
ſeeing no likelihood of coming ſoon to a ſecond engagement, returned
home. An irregular army being much eaſier led to battle, than induced to bear
the fatigues of a campaign.</p>
            <p>The pretender might now be convinced of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his
expectations, in imagining that the whole country would riſe up in his
cauſe; his affairs now were actually deſperate; yet, with the uſual
infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the family, he reſolved to hazard his perſon among his
friends in Scotland, at a time when ſuch a meaſure was totally uſeleſs.
Paſſing therefore through France in diſguiſe, and embarking in a
ſmall veſſel at Dunkirk, he arrived, on the twenty-ſecond day of
December, on the coaſts of Scotland, with only ſix gentlemen in his
retinue. Upon his arrival in Aberdeen, he was ſolemnly proclaimed, and ſoon
after made his public entry into Dundee; and, in two days more, came to Scoon,
where he intended to have the ceremony of his coronation performed. He ordered
thankſgivings for his ſafe arrival, injoined the miniſters to pray for
him in the churches; and, without the ſmalleſt ſhare of power, went
through all the ceremonies of royalty, which were, at ſuch a juncture,
perfectly ridiculous. After this unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant parade, he reſolved to abandon
the enterprize with the ſame levity with which it had been undertaken, and
embarked again for France, together with the Earl of Mar, and ſome others, in
a ſmall ſhip that lay in the harbour of Montroſs; and, in five days,
arrived at Gravelin. General Gordon, who was left com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the
forces, with the aſſiſtance of the Earl-marſhal, proceeded with them to
Aberdeen, where he ſecured three veſſels to ſail northward, which took
on board the perſons who intended to <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0443100202:127"/> make their
eſcape to the continent. In this manner the rebellion was ſuppreſſed;
but the fury of the victors did not ſeem in the leaſt to abate with
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The law was now put in force, with all its terrors; and the
priſons of London were crowded with thoſe deluded wretches whom the
miniſtry ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no diſpoſition to ſpare. The commons, in their
addreſs to the crown, declared they would proſecute in the moſt vigorous
manner the authors of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; and their reſolutions were as ſpeedy
as their meaſures were vindictive. The Earls Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wentwater, Nithſdale,
Carnwath, and Wintown; the Lords Widrington, Kenmuir, and Nairn, were
impeached. The <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> act was ſuſpended; and the rebel
Lords, upon pleading guilty, received ſentence of death. Nothing could
ſoften the Privy Council; the houſe of Lords even preſented an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to the throne for mercy, but without effect. Orders were diſpatched for
executing the Earls of Derwentwater and Nithſdale, and the viſcount
Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muir, immediately; the others were reſpited for three weeks longer.
Nithſdale, however, eſcaped in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's cloaths, which were brought him by
his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the night before his intended execution. Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wentwater and Kenmuir
were brought to the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold on Tower-hill, at the hour appointed. Both
underwent their ſentence with calmneſs and intrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, pitied by all,
ſeemingly leſs moved themſelves than the ſpectators.</p>
            <p>An act of parliament was alſo made for trying the private
priſoners in London, and not in Lancaſhire, where they were taken in arms;
which proceeding was, in ſome meaſure, an alteration of the ancient
conſtitution of the kingdom; when Foſter, Mackin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſh, and ſeveral
others were found guilty. Foſter, however, eſcaped from Newgate, and
reached the continent in ſafety; and ſome time after alſo Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intoſh,
with ſome others, forced their way, having <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0443100202:128"/> maſtered
the keeper and turnkey, and diſarmed the centinel. Four or five were hanged,
drawn, and quartered; among whom was William Paul, a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, who
profeſſed himſelf a true and ſincere member of the Church of England;
but not of that ſchiſmatical church whoſe Biſhops had abandoned their
King. Such was the end of a rebellion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably firſt inſpired by the
rigour of the new Whig miniſtry and parliament. In running through the
viciſſitudes of human tranſactions, we too often find both ſides
culpable; and ſo it was in this caſe. The royal party acted under the
influences of partiality, rigour, and prejudice, gratified private animoſity
under the maſk of public juſtice; and, in their pretended love of
juſtice, forgot humanity. On the other hand, the pretender's party aimed not
only at ſubverting the government, but the religion of the kingdom; bred a
Papiſt himſelf, he confided only in counſellors of his own
perſuaſion; and moſt of thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to his cauſe were men of
indifferent morals, or bigotted principles. Clemency, however, in the
government, at that time, would probably have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed all the factious
ſpirit which has hitherto diſturbed the peace of this country; for it has
ever been the character of the Engliſh, that they are more eaſily led than
driven to loyalty.</p>

            <p>IN a government, ſo very complicated as that of England, it muſt
neceſſarily change from itſelf, in a revolution of even a few years, as
ſome of its weaker branches acquire ſtrength, or its ſtronger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline.
At this period, the rich and noble ſeemed to poſſeſs a greater ſhare
of power than they had done for ſome ages preceding; the houſe of commons
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0443100202:129"/> each day a ſtronger body, at once more
inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the crown and the people. It was now ſeen that the rich could
at any time buy their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that while their laws governed the poor,
they might be enabled to govern the law. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion was now extinguiſhed;
and the ſeverities which juſtice had inflicted, excited the diſcontent of
many, whoſe humane paſſions were awakened as their fears began to
ſubſide. This ſerved as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for continuing the parliament, and
repealing the act by which they were to be diſſolved at the expiration of
every third year. An act of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which a parliament thus extended
their own power, was thought, by many, the ready means of undermining the
conſtitution; for if they could with impunity extend their continuance for
ſeven years, which was the time propoſed, they could alſo for life
continue their power; but this, it was obſerved, was utterly incompatible
with the ſpirit of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The bill, however, paſſed both
houſes; all objections to it were conſidered as diſaffection; and, in a
ſhort time, it received the royal ſanction. The people might murmur at this
encroachment; but it was now too late for redreſs.</p>
            <p>Domeſtic concerns being thus adjuſted, the King began to turn
his thoughts to his Hanoverian dominions, and determined upon a voyage to the
continent. Nor was he without his fears for his dominions there, as Charles
XII, of Sweden, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the higheſt diſpleaſure at his having
entered into a confederacy againſt him in his abſence. Having therefore
paſſed through Holland to Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in order to ſecure his German
territories, he entered into a treaty with the Dutch and the Regent of France,
by which they promiſed mutually to aſſiſt each other, in caſe of
invaſion; but the death of the Swediſh Monarch, who was killed by a
cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball at the ſiege of Frederickſtadt, ſoon put an 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0443100202:130"/> end to his diſquietudes from that quarter. However,
his Majeſty, to ſecure himſelf as far as alliances could add to his
ſafety, entered into various negotiations with the different powers of
Europe; ſome were brought to accede by money, others by promiſes. Treaties
of this kind ſeldom give any real ſecurity; they may be conſidered as
mere political playthings; they amuſe for a while, and then are thrown
neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, never more to be heard of, as nothing but its own internal
ſtrength or ſituation can guard a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from inſult.</p>
            <p>Among other treaties concluded with ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was that
called the <hi>Quadruple Alliance.</hi> It was agreed upon between the Emperor,
France, England, and Holland, that the Emperor ſhould renounce all
pretenſions to the crown of Spain, and exchange Sardinia for Sicily with the
Duke of Savoy. That the ſucceſſion to the Duchies of Tuſcany, Parma,
and Placentia, ſhould be ſettled on the Queen of Spain's eldeſt ſon, in
caſe the preſent poſſeſſors ſhould die without male iſſue.
This treaty was by no means favourable to the intereſts of England, as it
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the commerce with Spain; and, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the balance of
power in Italy, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much into the hands of Auſtria. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
England ſitted out a ſtrong ſquadron in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring Spain to terms,
if that kingdom ſhould inſiſt upon its rights in Italy. The war between
the Emperor and King of Spain was actually begun in that country; and the
mediation of the King of England was rejected, as partial and unjuſt. It was
therefore reſolved by the court of London to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its negotiations with
the ſtrongeſt reaſons; namely, thoſe of war. Sir George Byng ſailed
to Naples with twenty-two ſhips of the line, where he was received as a
deliverer, that city having been under the utmoſt terrors of an invaſion
from Spain. <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0443100202:131"/> Here the Engliſh admiral received
intelligence, that the Spaniſh army, amounting to thirty thouſand men, had
landed in Sicily; wherefore he immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſail thither, fully
reſolved to purſue the Spaniſh fleet. Upon doubling Cape Faro, he
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived two ſmall Spaniſh veſſels, and purſuing them cloſely
they led him to their main fleet, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noon, he perceived in line of
battle, amounting, in all, to twenty-ſeven ſail. At ſight of the
Engliſh fleet, the Spaniſh fleet, though ſuperior in numbers, attempted
to ſail away, as the Engliſh had, for ſome time, acquired ſuch
expertneſs in naval affairs, that no other nation would venture to face them,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with manifeſt advantage on their ſide. The Spaniards ſeemed
diſtracted in their councils, and acted with extreme confuſion; they made a
running fight; but notwithſtanding what they could do, all but three were
taken. The admiral, during this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, acted with equal prudence and
reſolution; and the King wrote him a letter with his own hand, approving his
conduct. This victory neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the reſentment and complaints
of the Spaniſh miniſters at all the courts of Europe, which induced England
to declare war with Spain; and the Regent of France joined England in a
ſimilar declaration. The Duke of Ormond now, once more, hoped, by the
aſſiſtance of Cardinal Alberoni, the Spaniſh mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to reſtore
the pretender in England. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſet ſail with ſome troops, and
proceeded as far as Cape Finiſterre, where his fleet was diſperſed, and
diſabled by a violent ſtorm, which entirely fruſtrated the armament; and,
from this time, the pretender ſeemed to loſe all hopes of being received in
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. This blow of fortune, together with the bad ſucceſs of the
Spaniſh arms in Sicily and elſewhere, once more induced them to wiſh for
peace; and the King of Spain was at laſt contented to ſign the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple
alliance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0443100202:132"/> King George having thus, with equal vigour
and deliberation, ſurmounted all the obſtacles he met with in his way to
the throne, and uſed every precaution that ſagacity could ſuggeſt, for
ſecuring himſelf in it, again returned to England, where the addreſſes
from both houſes were as loyal as he could expect. From addreſſing they
turned to an object of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; namely, that of ſecuring
the dependency of the Iriſh parliament upon that of Great Britain. Maurice
Anneſly had appealed to the houſe of Peers in England, from a decree of the
houſe of Peers in Ireland; which was reverſed. The Britiſh Peers ordered
the Barons of the Exchequer in Ireland, to put Mr. Anneſly in
poſſeſſion of the lands he had loſt by the decree in that kingdom.
The Barons obeyed this order, and the Iriſh houſe of Peers paſſed a
vote againſt them, as having attempted to diminiſh the juſt privileges of
the parliament of Ireland; and, at the ſame time, ordered the Barons to be
taken under the cuſtody of the Black Rod. On the other hand, the houſe of
Lords in England reſolved, that the Barons of the Exchequer in Ireland had
acted with courage and fidelity; and addreſſed the King to ſignify his
approbation of their conduct, by ſome marks of his favour. To complete their
intention, a bill was prepared, by which the Iriſh houſe of Lords was
deprived of all rights of final juriſdiction. This was oppoſed in both
houſes. In the lower houſe Mr. Pitt aſſerted, that it would only
increaſe the power of the Engliſh Peers, who already had too much. Mr.
Hungerford demonſtrated that the Iriſh Lords had always exerted their power
of finally deciding cauſes. The Duke of Leeds produced fifteen reaſons
againſt the bill; but, notwithſtanding all oppoſition, it was carried by
a great majority, and received the royal aſſent. The kingdom of Ireland was
not, at that time, ſo well acquainted with the nature of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iberty, and its own
conſtitution, as it is at preſent. <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0443100202:133"/> Their houſe of
Lords might then conſiſt moſtly of men bred up in luxury and ignorance;
neither ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited enough to make oppoſition, nor ſkilful enough to
conduct it.</p>
            <p>But this blow, which the Iriſh felt ſeverely, was not ſo great
as that which England now began to ſuffer from that ſpirit of avarice and
chicanery which had infected almoſt all ranks of people. In the year 1720,
John Law, a Scotchman, had erected a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in France under the name of the
Miſſiſippi; which, at firſt, promiſed the deluded people immenſe
wealth, but too ſoon appeared an impoſture, and left the greateſt part of
that nation in ruin and diſtreſs. The year following the people of England
were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by juſt ſuch another project, which is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered by all by
the name of the South-Sea ſcheme; and, to this day, felt by thouſands. To
explain this as conciſely as poſſible, it is to be obſerved, that ever
ſince the revolution, the government, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient ſupplies
granted by parliament; or, what was granted requiring time to be collected,
they were obliged to borrow money from ſeveral different companies of
merchants; and, among the reſt, from that company which traded to the
South-Sea. In the year 1716, they were indebted to this company about nine
millions and an half of money, for which they granted annually at the rate of
ſix <hi>per cent.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. As this company was not the only one, to
which the government was debtor, and paid ſuch large intereſt yearly, Sir
Robert Walpole conceived a deſign of leſſening theſe national debts, by
giving the ſeveral companies an alternative, either of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a lower
intereſt; namely, five <hi>per cent.</hi> for their money, or of being paid
the principal. The different companies choſe rather to accept of the
diminiſhed intereſt than their capital; and the South-Sea company
accordingly having made up their debt to the government ten millions, inſtead
of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds which they uſually received 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0443100202:134"/> as intereſt, were ſatisfied with five hundred
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. In the ſame manner the governors and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Bank, and
other companies, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to receive a diminiſhed annuity for their
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral loans, all which greatly leſſened the debts of the nation. It
was in this ſituation of things that Sir John Blount, who had been bred a
ſcrivener, and was poſſeſſed of all the cunning and plauſibility
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for ſuch an undertaking, propoſed to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, in the
name of the South-Sea company, to leſſen the national debt ſtill further,
by permitting the South-Sea company to buy up all the debts of the different
companies, and thus to become the principal creditor of the ſtate. The terms
offered the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were extremely advantageous. The South-Sea company was
to redeem the debts of the nation out of the hands of the private proprietors,
who were creditors to the government, upon whatever terms they could agree on;
and, for the intereſt of this money, which they had thus redeemed, and taken
into their own hands, they ſhould be allowed for ſix years five <hi>per
cent.</hi> and then the intereſt ſhould be reduced to four <hi>per
cent.</hi> and be redeemable by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. For theſe purpoſes a bill
paſſed both houſes; and as the directors of the South-Sea company could
not of themſelves alone be ſuppoſed to be poſſeſſed of money
ſufficient to buy up theſe debts of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they were impowered to
raiſe it by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſubſcription, and granting annuities to ſuch
proprietors as ſhould think proper to exchange their creditors; namely, the
Crown for the South-Sea company, with the advantages that might be made by
their induſtry. The ſuperior advantages with which the proprietors were
flattered, by thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing their property in the funds for South-Sea
ſtock were a chimerical proſpect of having their money
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urned to great advantage, by a
commerce to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>outhern parts of
America, where it was reported, <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0443100202:135"/> that the Engliſh were
to have ſome new ſettlements granted them by the King of Spain. The
directors books therefore were no ſooner opened for the firſt
ſubſcription, but crowds came to make the exchange; the deluſion
ſpread; ſubſcriptions in a few days ſold for double the price they had
been bought for. The ſcheme ſucceeded, and the whole nation was infected
with a ſpirit of avaricious enterprize. The infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation prevailed; the
ſtock increaſed to a ſurpriſing degree; but after a few months, the
people awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their delirium; they ſound that all the advantages to be
expected were merely imaginary; and an infinite number of families were
involved in ruin. Many of the directors whoſe arts had raiſed theſe vain
expectations, had amaſſed ſurpriſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: it was, however, one
conſolation to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to find the parliament ſtripping them of their
ill-acquired wealth; and orders were given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all directors of the
South Sea company from their ſeats in the houſe of commons, or the places
they poſſeſſed under the government. The delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents being puniſhed
by a forfeiture of their eſtates, the parliament next converted its at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ention toward redreſſing the
ſufferers. Several uſeful and juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions were taken, and a bill
was ſpeedily prepared towards repairing the miſchiefs. Of the profits
ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the South-Sea ſcheme, the ſum of ſeven millions was
granted to the ancient proprietors; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral additions alſo were made to
their dividends out of what was poſſeſſed by the company in their own
right, the remaining capital ſtock alſo was divided among all the
proprietors at the rate of thirty-three pounds <hi>per cent.</hi> In the mean
time petitions from all parts of the kingdom were preſented to the houſe,
demanding juſtice; and the whole nation ſeemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated to the
higheſt degree. During theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, the King, with ſerenity and
wiſdom preſided at the helm, influenced his parliament to purſue
equitable <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0443100202:136"/> meaſures, and, by his councils, endeavoured
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the credit of the nation.</p>
            <p>The diſcontents occaſioned by theſe public cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, once
more gave the diſaffected party hopes of riſing. But, in all their councils
they were weak, divided, and wavering. Their preſent deſigns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not eſcape the vigilance of the King, who had emiſſaries in every
court, and who had made, by his alliances, every potentate a friend to his
cauſe. He was therefore informed, by the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France,
of a new conſpiracy raiſed againſt him by ſeveral perſons of
diſtinction, which poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned his intended journey to Hanover. Among
thoſe againſt whom the moſt poſitive evidence was obtained, was Mr.
Chriſtopher Layer, a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Middle Temple. He was convicted
of having inliſted men for the pretender's ſervice, and received ſentence
of death; which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, after having been often examined, and having
ſtrenuouſly refuſed, to the laſt, to diſcover his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices. He
was the only perſon who ſuffered death upon this occaſion; but ſeveral
noblemen of high diſtinction were made priſoners upon ſuſpicion. The
Duke of Norfolk, the Biſhop of Rocheſter, the Lord Orrery, and the Lord
North and Grey were of this number. Of theſe all but the Biſhop of
Rocheſter c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me off without
puniſhment, the circumſtances not being ſufficient againſt them for
conviction. A bill was brought into the houſe of commons againſt him,
although a Peer; and though it met with ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yet it was
reſolved by a great majority, that he ſhould be deprived of his office and
benefice, and baniſhed the kingdom for ever. The Biſhop made no defence in
the lower houſe, reſerving all his power to be exerted in the houſe of
Lords. In that aſſembly he had many friends; his eloquence, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs,
and ingenuity had procured him many; and his cauſe being heard, a long and
warm debate was <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0443100202:137"/> the conſequence. As there was little
againſt him but intercepted letters, which were written in cypher, the Earl
Pawlet inſiſted on the danger and injuſtice of departing, in ſuch
caſes, from the fixed rules of evidence. The Duke of Wharton having ſummed
up the depoſitions, and ſhewn the inſufficiency of them, concluded with
ſaying, That let the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences be what they would, he hoped the
luſtre of that houſe would be never tarniſhed, by condemning a man
without evidence. The Lord Bathurſt ſpoke alſo againſt the bill,
obſerving, That if ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary proceedings were countenanced, he
ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaining for him and others to do, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their
country-houſes, and there, if poſſible, quietly enjoy their eſtates
within their own families, ſince the leaſt correſpondence, or intercepted
letter, might be made criminal. Then turning to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, he ſaid he
could hardly account for the inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate hatred and malice ſome perſons
bore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Biſhop of Rocheſter, unleſs it was, that they were
infatuated like the wild Americans, who ſond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe they inherit, not
only the ſpoils, but even the abilities of any man they kill. The Earl of
Strafford ſpoke on the ſame ſide; as alſo Lord Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, who obſerved,
That if men were, in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented manner, proceeded againſt, without
le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal proof, in a ſhort time the miniſter's favour would be the
ſubject's only protection; but that for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, no apprehenſion of what
he might ſuffer, would deter him from doing his duty. He was anſwered by
Lord Seafield, who endeavoured to ſhew, that the evidence which had been
produced before them was ſufficient to convince any reaſonable man; and, in
this, he was ſupported by the Duke of Argyle and Lord Lechmere. To theſe
Lord Cowper replied, That the ſtrongeſt argument urged in behalf of the
bill, was neceſſity; but, for his part, he could ſee nothing that could
juſtify ſuch unprecedented, and <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0443100202:138"/> ſuch dangerous
proceedings. The other party, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſaid little in anſwer; perhaps
already ſenſible of a majority in their favour. The bill was paſſed
againſt the Biſhops, and ſeveral Lords entered their proteſt. Among the
members of the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who had exerted themſelves moſt
ſtrenuouſly in the Biſhop's favour, was Doctor Friend, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
phyſician; and he was now taken into cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody on ſuſpicion of
treaſonable practices. He was ſoon after, however, admitted to bail; his
friend Doctor Mead becoming his ſecurity. In two days after the Biſhop of
Rocheſter embarked for baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accompanied with his daughter; and, on
the ſame day that he landed at Calais, the famous Lord Bolingbroke arrived
there, in his return to England, having obtained his Majeſty's pardon. Upon
which the Biſhop, ſmiling, ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>His Lordſhip and I are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed.</hi>
               </q> In
this manner the Biſhop continued in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile and poverty till he died; though
it may not be improper to obſerve, that Doctor Sacheverel left him, by will,
five hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>Few tranſactions of importance happened during the remainder of
this reign; the miniſtry were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making various and expenſive
negotiations, alliances, and treaties; covenants that are made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith,
and only obſerved from motives of intereſt or fear. The parliament made
alſo ſome efforts to cheek the progreſs of vice and immorality, which now
began to be diffuſed through every rank of life; luxury and profligacy had
increaſed to a ſurpriſing degrce; nor were there any tranſactions to
fill the page of hiſtory, except the mercenary ſchemes of vile projectors,
or the taſteleſs profuſion of new-made opulence. The treaties lately
concluded with Spain were again broken, perhaps by every party; admiral
Hoſier was ſent to intercept the Spaniſh galleons from America; of which
the Spaniards being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, remanded back their treaſure; and the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0443100202:139"/> part of the Engliſh fleet, ſent on this
errand, was rendered, by the worms, entirely unfit for ſervice; and the men
were cut off by the unhealthy climate and long voyage. To retaliate this, the
Spaniards undertook the ſiege of Gibraltar, and with ſimilar ſucceſs.
New treaties were ſet on foot; France of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered its mediation; and ſuch a
reconciliation as treaties could procure was the conſequence.</p>
            <p>The King had not now, for two years, viſited his German dominions;
and therefore ſoon after the breaking up of parliament he prepared for a
journey to Hanover. Accordingly, having appointed an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration in his
abſence, he embarked for Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; lay, upon his landing, at the little town
of Vert; next day proceeded on his journey; and, in two days more, between ten
and eleven at night, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Delden, in all appearance in perfect health.
He ſupped there very heartily, and eat an orange; and continued his
progreſs early the next morning. Between eight and nine he ordered the coach
to ſtop, and, it being perceived that one of his hands lay motionleſs,
monſieur Fabrice, who had formerly been the ſervant of the King of Sweden,
and now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended King George, chafed it between his. As this had no effect,
the ſurgeon was called, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on horſeback, and alſo rubbed it
with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; ſoon after the King's tongue began to ſwell, and he had
juſt force enough to bid them haſten to Oſnaburgh; and, falling into
Fabrice's arms, quite inſenſible, never recovered, but expired about eleven
o'clock the next morning. He died on Sunday the eleventh of June, in the
ſixty-eighth year of his age, and in the thirteenth of his reign. Whatever
was good or great in the reign of George I, ought to be attributed wholly to
himſelf; and whenever he deviated, it might juſtly be imputed to a
miniſtry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways partial, and often corrupt. He was almoſt ever

partly owing <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0443100202:140"/> to prudence, and more to aſſiduity. In

            <p>I Have not hitherto ſaid any thing of the literature of the
preſent period, having reſolved to refer it to a ſeparate letter, in
which we may have a more perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous view of it, than if blended with the
ordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of the ſtate. Though learning had never received fewer
encouragements than in the preſent reign, yet it never flouriſhed more.
That ſpirit of philoſophy which had been excited in former ages, ſtill
continued to operate with the greateſt ſucceſs, and produced the
greateſt men in every profeſſion. Among the divines, Atterbury and Clarke
diſtinguiſhed themſelves. As a preacher, Atterbury united all the graces
of ſtyle with all the elegance of a juſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; he was natural, polite,
ſpirited; and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons may be ranked among the firſt of this period.
Clarke, on the other hand, deſpiſing the graces of eloquence, only ſought
after conviction, with rigorous though phlegmatic exactneſs, and brought
moral truths almoſt to mathematical preciſion. Yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, Cudworth,
nor any other divine, did ſuch ſervice to the reaſoning world, as the
great Mr. John Locke, who may be juſtly ſaid to have reformed all our modes
of thinking in metaphyſical inquiry. Though the jargon of ſchools had been
before him arraigned, yet ſeveral of their errors had ſtill
ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were regarded as true. Locke therefore ſet

            <p>Among the moral writers of this period, the Earl of Shafteſbury is
not to be paſſed over, whoſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, in ſome meaſure,

But, of all the other arts, poetry in this age was carried to the greateſt
perfection. The language, for ſome ages, had been improving, but now it
ſeemed entirely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of its roughneſs and barbarity. Among the poets
of this period we may place John Philips, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſeveral poems, but of
none more admired than that humourous one, intitled, <hi>The ſplendid
Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> he lived in obſcurity, and died juſt above want. William
Congreve deſerves alſo particular notice; his comedies, ſome of which
were but cooly received upon their firſt appearance, ſeemed to mend upon
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition; and he is, at preſent, juſtly allowed the foremoſt in that
ſpecies of dramatic poeſy. His wit is ever juſt and brilliant; his
ſentiments new and lively; and his elegance equal to his regularity. Next him
Vanburgh is placed, whoſe humour ſeems more natural, and characters more
new; but he owes too many obligations to the French, entirely to paſs for an
original; and his total diſregard to decency, in a great meaſure, impairs
his merit. Farquhar is ſtill more lively, and, perhaps, more entertaining
than either; his pieces ſtill continue the favourite performances of the
ſtage, and bear frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition without ſatiety; but he often
miſtakes pertneſs for wit, and ſeldom ſtrikes his characters with
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per force or originality. However, he died very young; and it is
remarkable, that he continued to improve as he grew older; his laſt play,
intitled <hi>The Beau Stratagem,</hi> being the beſt of his productions.

His Campaign, and Letter to Lord Halifax from Italy, are maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces in the
former, and his Eſſays publiſhed in the Spectator are inimitable
ſpecimens of the latter. Whatever he treated of was handled with elegance

was enforced by his example. Steele <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0443100202:143"/> was Addiſon's
friend and admirer; his comedies ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

perfectly polite, chaſte, and genteel; nor were hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> other works contemptible; he wrote on ſevera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſubjects, and yet it is amazing, in
the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of his purſuits, how he found leiſure fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuing impracticable ſchemes, ſuggeſted by ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ambition.
Dean Swift was the profeſſed antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt of both Addiſon and him. He
perceived that there was a ſpirit of romance mixed with all the works of the
poets who preceded him; or, in other words, that they had drawn nature on the
moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſide. There ſtill therefore was a place left for him,
who, careleſs of cenſure, ſhould deſcribe it juſt as it was, with all
its deformities; he therefore owes much of his fame, not ſo much to the
greatneſs of his genius, as to the boldneſs of it. He was dry,
ſarcaſtic, and ſevere; and ſuited his ſtyle exactly to the turn of
his thought, being conciſe and nervous. In this period alſo flouriſhed
many of ſubordinate fame. Prior was the firſt who adopted the French
elegant eaſy manner of telling a ſtory; but if what he has borrowed from
that nation be taken from him, ſcarce any thing will be left upon which he
can lay claim to applauſe in poetry. Rowe was only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by Shakeſpear
and Otway as a tragic writer; he has fewer abſurdities than either; and is,
perhaps, as pathetic as they; but his flights are not ſo bold, nor his
characters ſo ſtrongly marked. Perhaps his coming later than the reſt may
have contributed to leſſen the eſteem he deſerves. Garth had
ſucceſs as a poet; and, for a time, his fame was even greater than his
deſert. In his principal work, the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, his verſification is
negligent; and his plot is now become tedious; but whatever he may loſe as a
poet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t would be improper to rob
him of the merit he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves for having written the proſe dedication, and 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0443100202:144"/> preface, to the poem already mentioned; in which he has
ſhewn the trueſt wit, with the moſt refined ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. Parnel, though he
has written but one poem, namely, the Hermit, yet has found a place among the
Engliſh firſt-rate poets. Gay, likewiſe, by his Fables and Paſtorals,
has acquired an equal reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But of all who have added to the ſtock of
Engliſh poetry, Pope, perhaps, deſerves the firſt place. On him
foreigners look as one of the moſt ſucceſsful writers of his time; his
verſification is the moſt harmonious, and his correctneſs the moſt
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable of all our poets. A noted cotemporary of his own, calls the
Engliſh the fineſt writers on mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral topics, and Pope the nobleſt moral
writer of all the Engliſh. Mr. Pope has ſomewhere named himſelf the
laſt Engliſh Muſe; and, indeed, ſince his time, we have ſeen ſcarce
any production that can juſtly lay claim to immortality; he carried the
language to its higheſt perfection; and thoſe who have attempted ſtill
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to improve it, inſtead of ornament, have only caught finery.</p>
            <p>Such was the learning of this period; it flouriſhed without
encouragement, and the Engliſh taſte ſeemed to diffuſe itſelf over
all Europe. The French tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies began to be written after the model of ours;
our philoſophy was adopted by all who pretended to reaſon for themſelves.
At preſent, however, when the learned of Europe are turned to the Engliſh
writers for inſtruction, all ſpirit of learning has ceaſed amongſt us.
So little has been got by literature for more than an age, that none chuſe to
turn to it for preferment. Church preferments, which were once given as the
rewards of learning, have, for ſome time, deviated to the intriguing, venal,
and baſe. All deſire of novelty, in thinking, is ſuppreſſed amongſt
us; and our ſcholars, more pleaſed with ſecurity and eaſe than honour,
cooly follow the reaſonings of their predeceſſors, and walk round the
circle of former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>

turned only to ſerve himſelf, and his friends, he undertook to make a
majority in the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by bribing the members; and, what was
ſtill worſe, avowed the corruption. As all ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity was now
laughed out of the kingdom; and as the people were held to duty by no motives
of religious obedience to the throne, patriotiſm was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed, and venality
practiſed without ſhame. As ſuch a diſpoſition of things naturally
produced oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, Sir Robert was poſſeſſed of a moſt phlegmatic
inſenſibility to bear reproach, and a calm diſpaſſionate way of
reaſoning upon ſuch topics as he deſired to enforce. His diſcourſe
was fluent without elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and his reaſons convincing, without any
ſhare of elevation.</p>
            <p>The houſe of commons, which, in the preceding reign, had been
diſtinguiſhed into Whigs and Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, now underwent another change, and
was again divided into the Court and Country party. The Court party were for
favouring all the ſchemes of the miniſtry, and applauding all the
meaſures of the crown. They regarded foreign alliances as condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to
internal ſecurity; and paid the troops of other countries for their
promiſes of future aſſiſtance. Of theſe Sir Robert was the leader;
and ſuch as he could not convince by his eloquence, he undertook to buy over
by places and penſions. The other ſide. who called themſelves the Country
party, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely averſe to continental connexions; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that
immenſe ſums were laviſhed on ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which could never be
uſeful; and that alliances were bought with money, which ſhould be only

            <p>All theſe treaties and alliances, however, in which the kingdom

were quietly admitted, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Duchy of Tuſcany, to ſecure
for him the reverſion of that Dukedom. Thus we ſee Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, in ſome
meaſure, reſembling a republic, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Monarchs into new kingdoms, and
depriving others of their ſucceſſion by an univerſal concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But
this amicable diſpoſition among the great powers can never continue long;
and the republic of Europe will be but an empty name, until there be ſome
controlling power ſet up by univerſal conſent, to enforce obedience to
the law of nations.</p>
            <p>During this interval of profound peace, nothing remarkable happened,
except the conſtant diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the houſe of commons, where the
conteſts between the Court and Country party were carried on with the
greateſt acrimony; the ſpeeches, on either ſide, being dictated leſs by
reaſon than reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A calm unintereſted reader is now ſurprized at
the heat with which many ſubjects of little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in themſelves, were
diſcuſſed at that time; he now ſmiles at thoſe denunciations of ruin
with which their orations are replete. The truth is, the liberty of a nation is
better ſupported by ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, than by what is ſaid in the
oppoſition.</p>
            <p>In times of profound tranquility the ſlighteſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
become objects of univerſal attention. A ſociety of men, intitled, <hi>The
charitable Corporation,</hi> excited the indignation of the public. Their
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed intention was, to lend money at legal intereſt to the poor,
upon ſmall pledges; and to perſons of better rank, upon proper ſecurity.
Their capital was at firſt limited to thirty thouſand pounds; but they
afterwards increaſed it to ſix hundred thouſand. This money was granted
in by ſubſcription; and the care of conducting the capital was intruſted
to a pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

number of directors. This company, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for more than twenty
years, the caſhier, George Robinſon, and the warehouſe-keeper of the
company, diſappeared in one day. Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds of the
capital appeared to be ſunk, and embezzled by the directors, in a manner the
proprietors could not account for. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore petitioned the houſe,
repreſenting the manner in which they had been defrauded of ſuch vaſts
ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the diſtreſs to which many were reduced to, in
conſequence of ſuch impoſition. The petition was received, and a ſecret
committee appointed to inquire into the grievance. They ſoon diſcovered a
moſt iniquitous ſcene of fraud, which had been carried on by Thompſon and
Robinſon, in concert with ſome of the directors, for embezzling the
capital, and cheating the proprietors. Many perſons of rank and quality were
concerned in this infamous conſpiracy; ſome of the firſt characters in
the nation did not eſcape without cenſure. The houſe of commons declared
their reſentment, and expelled one or two of their members; but the
ſufferers met with ſcarce any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. Nor can I mention ſuch a
circumſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting on that ſpirit of rapacity and avarice
which infected every degree of people. An ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the governing part of
a country ever diffuſes itſelf downward; and, while the miniſtry do not
bluſh at detection, the people of every rank will not fear guilt. About this
time not leſs than five members of parliament were expelled for the moſt
ſordid acts of knavery; Sir Robert Sutton, Sir Archibald Grant, and George
Robinſon, for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of Lords, that not <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0443100202:151"/> one ſhilling of the forfeited
eſtates was ever applied to the ſervice of the public; but became the
reward of avarice and venality.</p>
            <p>Another occurrence of a more private nature, about this time,
excited public compaſſion, not without a degree of horror: Richard Smith, a
book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binder, and his wife, had long lived together, and ſtruggled with
thoſe wants, which, notwithſtanding the profuſion of the rich at this
time, oppreſſed the poor. Their mutual tenderneſs for each other, was the
only comfort they had in their diſtreſſes, which diſtreſſes were
increaſed by having a child, which they knew not how to maintain. At length,
they took the deſperate reſolution of dying by their own hands; the child's
throat was cut, and the huſband and wife were found hanging in their
bed-chamber. They left a letter behind, containing the reaſons which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
them to this act of deſperation; they declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they could no longer
ſupport a life of ſuch complicated wretchedneſs; and thought it
tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take their child with them, from a world where they
themſelves had found no compaſſion. Suicide, in many inſtances, is
aſcribed to phrenzy: we have here an inſtance of ſelf-murder, concerted
with compoſure, and borrowing the aids of reaſon for its vindication.</p>

            <p>THE Hiſtory of England has little, during this interval, to excite
curioſity. The debates in parliament grew every day more obſtinate, as
every ſubject happened to come round in voting the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſupplies. But as
the ſubjects were moſtly the ſame, ſo alſo were the arguments. There
was one, <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0443100202:152"/> however, of a different nature from thoſe in
the uſual courſe of buſineſs, which was laboured for ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly by
the miniſtry, and as warmly oppoſed by their antagoniſts, namely, the
exciſe bill, which Sir Robert Walpole introduced into the houſe, by firſt
declaiming againſt the frauds practiſed by the factors in London, who were
employed by the American planters in ſelling their tobacco. To prevent
theſe frauds he propoſed, inſtead of having the cuſtoms levied in the
uſual manner upon tobacco, that what was imported ſhould be lodged in
warehouſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe by the officers of the crown; from
thence to be ſold, after paying the duty of four-pence <hi>per</hi> pound,
when the proprietor found a market for it. This propoſal raiſed a violent
ferment, not leſs in the houſe than without doors. Thoſe who oppoſed
the ſcheme, aſſerted, that this ſcheme would expoſe the factors to
ſuch hardſhips, that they would not be able to continue the trade, nor
would it prevent the frauds complained of. They aſſerted, that it would
produce an additional ſwarm of exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers and warehouſe-keepers,
which would at once tender the miniſtry formidable, and the people
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant. Arguments, however, were not what the miniſtry moſt dreaded;
for the people had been raiſed into ſuch a ferment, that all the avenues to
the houſe were crowded with complaining multitudes; and Sir Robert Walpole
began even to fear for his life. The miniſtry carried the propoſal in the
houſe; but, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tumult of the people, they thought fit to drop
the deſign. The miſcarriage of the bill was celebrated with public
rejoicings in London and Weſtminſter; and the miniſter was burned in
effigy by the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
            <p>This ſucceſs, in the members of the oppoſition, encouraged
them to go on to a propoſal for repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an act made in the laſt reign,
by which the houſe of commons was to be ſeptennial. They propoſed 
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0443100202:153"/> that parliaments ſhould again be made triennial, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

priſoners witneſſes could not, or dare not, to come. That, by another, a
juſtice of the peace was impowered to put the beſt ſubjects to immediate
death only, after reading a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt riots. The South-Sea
ſcheme, they ſaid, was eſtabliſhed by an act of a ſeptennial
parliament; and the exciſe bill had like, under their influence alſo, to
have paſſed into a law. Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Wyndham diſtinguiſhed himſelf in
this debate: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Let us ſuppoſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a man
without any ſenſe of honour raiſed to be a chief miniſter of ſtate.
Suppoſe him poſſeſſed of great wealth; the plunder of the nation.
Suppoſe him ſcreened by a corrupt majority of his creatures, and
inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all men of family, ſenſe, and honour, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let
us ſuppoſe a venal parliament, and an ignorant King; I hope ſuch a caſe
will never occur; but ſhould ſuch ever happen to be at once united, a
ſhort parliament will be the only means of leſſening the evil.</hi>
               </q>
Notwithſtanding theſe expoſtulations, the miniſtry were, as uſual,
vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and the motion ſuppreſſed by the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Country
party now found themſelves out-numbered upon every occaſion; they had long
complained, in vain, that debate was uſeleſs, ſince every member ſeemed
to have liſted himſelf under the banners of party, to which he held without
ſhrinking. Deſpairing therefore of being able to ſtem the torrent of
corruption, they retired to their ſeats in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0443100202:154"/> and left the miniſtry an undiſputed majority in the
houſe.</p>
            <p>The miniſter being now left without oppoſition in the houſe,
took this opportunity to render his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals odious or contemptible, by getting
ſeveral uſeful laws paſſed in their abſence; while the King
labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with equal aſſiduity, to adjuſt the political ſcale of
Europe; and, for this purpoſe, made ſeveral journies to his Electoral
dominions. But his aſſiduity in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreign differences did not
prevent one of a more domeſtic nature; for a miſunderſtanding aroſe
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Prince of Wales; a Prince that was the darling of the
people, and who profeſſed his diſlike both of the miniſtry and their
venal meaſures. He had been, a ſhort time before, married to the Princeſs
of Saxegotha; and the Prince's miſtaking a meſſage from the King, at a
time when the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was lying-in, firſt cauſed the rupture. It was
ſoon after widened by the vile emiſſaries of the court, ſo that his
Majeſty forbade the Prince his preſence; and gave orders that none of his
attendants ſhould be admitted to court. A motion, however, was made in the
houſe of commons, for increaſing the Prince's ſettlement, which was but
fifty thouſand pounds, to an hundred thouſand. It was repreſented that
ſo much had been granted by the late King, to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty, when
Prince of Wales; and that ſuch a ſettlement was conformable to the practice
of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, and neceſſary to the independency of the heir apparent to
the Engliſh crown. This motion was vigorouſly oppoſed by Sir Robert
Walpole, as an incroachment on the prerogative, and an officious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddling
in the King's family affairs. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the motion obſerved, that
the allowance of fifty thouſand pounds was not ſufficient to defray the
Prince's yearly expences, which, by his Majeſty's own regulation, amounted to
ſixty-three thouſand. The motion, however, met the fate of all other
anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſterial <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0443100202:155"/> meaſures, being rejected by the
majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>But whatever imaginary diſappointments the people might ſuffer,
there was a blow levelled at the little wit that was left remaining, which has
effectually baniſhed all taſte from the ſtage, and from which it has
never ſince recovered. When Walpole entered into power, he reſolved to
deſpiſe that ſet of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate writers, who live by arraigning every
miniſtry, and diſſeminate ſcandal and abuſe. For a time he
proſecuted that intention; but, at laſt, found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to employ
a ſet of mean hirelings, to anſwer calumny with calumny. He wanted judgment
to diſtinguiſh genius; or none poſſeſſed of ſuch a gift were mean
enough to applaud his meaſures. From hence he took an implacable averſion
to the preſs, which ſo ſeverely expoſed his corruption, and branded his
follies. But the preſs alone was not the only ſcourge he had to fear; the
theatre joined all its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, and he ſaw himſelf expoſed as the
object of ſcorn, as well as hatred. When licenſe once tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes

               </q> The
houſe applauded his wit and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and the queſtion was carried
againſt him.</p>
            <p>The diſcontents occaſioned by ſuch proceedings at home, were
ſtill more increaſed by the depredations of the Spaniards. They diſputed
the right of the Engliſh to cut logwood in the Bay of Campeachy in America; a
right which had been often acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, but never clearly explained, in all
former treaties between the two kingdoms. Their <hi>Guarda Coſtas</hi>
plundered the Engliſh merchants with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and, upon the leaſt
reſiſtance, behaved with inſolence, cruelty, and rapine. The ſubjects
of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain were buried in the mines of Potoſi, deprived of all means of
conveying their complaints to their protectors, and their veſſels
confiſcated, in defiance of juſtice. The Engliſh court made frequent
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances to that of Madrid, of this outrageous violation of treaties.
and they received for anſwer only promiſes of inquiry, which produced no
refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Our merchants loudly complained of theſe outrages; but the
miniſter expected, from negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that redreſs which could only be
obtained by arms. He knew that a war would increaſe the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he had
to encounter; and he was ſenſible that thoſe he already encountered
required all his art and induſtry to remove. A war, he was ſenſible,
would require expences which he wiſhed to ſhare in peace. In ſhort, all
his meaſures now were not to ſerve the ſtate, but to preſerve his
power. Influenced by theſe conſiderations, he induſtriouſly endcavoured
to avoid a rupture. The fears he diſcovered only ſerved to 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0443100202:157"/> increaſe the enemies inſolence and pride. However
the complaints of the Engliſh merchants were loud enough to reach the houſe
of commons; their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and memorials were produced, and their griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
enforced at the bar by council. The houſe, at length, agreed to an addreſs,
to intreat his Majeſty to obtain effectual relief, and to convince Spain that
its indignities would be no longer borne with impunity. Theſe complaints
produced a convention between the two crowns, concluded at Prado, importing,
that two plenipotentiaries ſhould meet at Madrid, to regulate the
reſpective pretenſions of either kingdom, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trade in
America, and the limits of Florida and Carolina. Theſe conferences were to be
finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in eight months; and, in the mean time, all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile preparations
ſhould ceaſe on either ſide. His Catholic Majeſty agreed to pay the
King of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ninety-five thouſand pounds, to ſatisfy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Britiſh ſubjects upon the crown of Spain, after deducting from the
whole the demands of the crown and ſubjects of Spain upon that of Britain.
Such an agreement as this was juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded on the ſide of the Britiſh
miniſtry as a baſe deſertion of the honour and intereſts of their
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And when the houſe of commons came to take the convention under
conſideration, it produced the warmeſt debate. All the adherents to the
Prince of Wales had joined in the oppoſition. It was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the
Spaniards, inſtead of granting a redreſs, had rather extorted a releaſe
for their former conduct. That they ſtill aſſerted their former right to
ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Engliſh ſhips, and had not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the word
<hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in all the treaty. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the
remonſtrances againſt this treaty, the majority of the houſe declared in
its favour; and ſeveral members of the oppoſite ſentiment retired from
parliament, having deſpaired of being longer <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0443100202:158"/>
ſerviceable in a place where party, and not reaſon, prevailed.</p>
            <p>As Spain had engaged to pay a large ſum of money by this
convention, ſome time after, when the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter demanded a ſupply, upon a
different occaſion, Lord Bathurſt moved to know, whether Spain had paid the
ſums ſtipulated, as the time limited for the payment was expired. The Duke
of Newcaſtle, by his Majeſty's permiſſion, acquainted the houſe, that
it was not paid; and that Spain had aſſigned no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the delay. In
ſome meaſure, therefore, to atone for his former ſlowneſs, the
miniſter now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to put the nation into a condition for war. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of
repriſal were granted againſt the Spaniards. Theſe preparations were
regarded by the Spaniſh court as actual hoſtilities. The French
ambaſſador at the Hague declared, that the King his maſter was obliged,
by treaties, to aſſiſt the King of Spain; he diſſuaded the Dutch from
eſpouſing the cauſe of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; who promiſed him an inviolable
neutrality. It is curious enough to conſider the revolutions which the
political ſyſtem of Europe had undergone. But about twenty years before,
France and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were combined againſt Spain; at preſent, France and
Spain united againſt England. Thoſe ſtateſmen who build upon alliances
as a laſting baſis of power, will, at length, find themſelves fatally
miſtaken.</p>
            <p>A rupture between Great Britain and Spain being now become
inevitable, the people, who had long clamoured for war, began to feel uncommon
alacrity at its approach; and the miniſtry finding it unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, began to
be earneſt in preparation. Orders were iſſued for augmenting the land
forces, and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a body of marines. Two rich Spaniſh prizes were taken
in the Mediterranean, and war declared againſt them in form. Admiral Vernon
was ſent to the Weſt-Indies, commander of the fleet, in order
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o diſtreſs the Spaniards in
that part of the globe. <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0443100202:159"/> Vernon was a rough and honeſt
ſoldier, untainted with the corruption or the effeminacy of the times. He
had, in the houſe of commons, aſſerted, that Porto-Bello, a fort and
harbour in South America, might be eaſily taken, and that he himſelf would
undertake to reduce it with ſix ſhips only. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which appeared ſo
wild, and impoſſible, was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed by the miniſtry; but, as he ſtill
inſiſted upon the propoſal, they were pleaſed in complying with his
requeſt. This would at once rid them of a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome antagoniſt in the
houſe; and, in caſe of his failure, there would be a new cauſe of triumph
in his diſgrace. In this, however, they were diſappointed. The admiral,
with ſix ſhips only, attacked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed all the fortifications of
the place, and came away victorious, almoſt without bloodſhed. This dawning
of ſucceſs upon the Britiſh arms induced the houſe of commons to enter
vigorouſly into the King's meaſures for carrying on the war. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
him to equip a very powerful navy; they voted a ſubſidy to the King of
Denmark, and impowered their Sovereign to defray ſome other expences, not
ſpecified in the eſtimates; the whole of their grants amounting to about
four millions. The war was carried on with vigour, and the debates in the
houſe of commons became leſs violent. In a nation, like England, of arts,
arms, and commerce, war, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain intervals of time, muſt ever be
ſerviceable. It turns the current of wealth from the induſtrious to the
enterpriſing. Thus, all orders of mankind find encouragement, and the nation
becomes compoſed of individuals, who have ſkill to acquire property, and
who have courage to defend it.</p>

            <p>A War between England and Spain was ſufficient to communicate
diſturbances over all the globe. Countries that were once too obſcure to be
known, were now ſeen to ſend out fleets, one ſhip of which was capable of
deſtroying all the naval power of an Aſiatic empire. A ſquadron of
ſhips commanded by Commodore Anſon was equipped, in order to ſail through
the Streights of Magellan into the South Sea, and to act againſt the enemy on
the coaſts of Chili and Peru. This fleet was to co-operate occaſionally
with Admiral Vernon acroſs the Iſthmus of Darien; but the delays and
blunders of the miniſtry fruſtrated this ſcheme, though originally well
laid. However, though too late in the ſeaſon, the Commodore ſet forward
with five ſhips of the line, a frigate, and two ſtore-ſhips, ſupplied
with proviſions and other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, deſigned to carry on a trade with
the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage inhabitants of that part of the world, or to conciliate their
affections. The number of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, in all, to about fourteen hundred,
includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two hundred invalids taken from the hoſpitals, and two hundred new
raiſed recruits. This whole expedition is a fine inſtance of the power of
perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in forcing fortune. The Commodore ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his courſe by
the iſland of Madeira, proceeded to the Cape Verd Iſlands, and ſailed
along the coaſts of Brazil. He refreſhed for ſome time at the iſland of
St. Catharine, in twenty-ſeven degrees of ſouthern latitude; a ſpot that
enjoys all the verdure and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of thoſe luxurious climates. From this
place he ſteered ſtill onward into the cold and tempeſtuous cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of
the ſouth, along the coaſt of Patagonia; and, in about five months, entered
the famous Streights of Magellan. After having ſuffered the moſt violent
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts he doubled Cape Horn; the reſt of his fleet were 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0443100202:161"/> diſperſed or wrecked; his crew deplorably diſabled
by the ſcurvy; and his own ſhip with difficulty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the Iſland of
Juan Fernandez. In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious abode he remained for ſome time, where
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemed, in ſome meaſure, to conſole mankind far the calamities
of their own avarice and ambition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
In order to improve ſtill farther a retreat of ſuch elegance, he ordered
ſeveral European ſeeds and fruits to be ſown upon the iſland, which
increaſed to ſuch a ſurpriſing degree, that ſome Spaniards, who,
ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years after, landed there, and found them in plenty, could not avoid
acknowledging this act of generoſity and benevolence. Here the Commodore was
joined by one ſhip more of his fleet, and by the Tryal frigate of ſeven
guns. Advancing now north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, towards the tropic of Capricorn, he attacked
the city of Payta by night. In this bold attempt he made no uſe of his
ſhips, nor even landed all his men. A few ſoldiers landed by night, and
filled the whole town with terror and confuſion. The governor of the
garriſon, and the inhabitants, fled on all ſides; accuſtomed to cruelty
over a conquered enemy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they expected a ſimilitude of
treatment. In the mean time, for three days, a ſmall number of Engliſh kept
poſſeſſion of the town, and ſtripped it of all its treaſures and
merchandize, to an immenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount. Such of the negroes as had not fled were
made uſe of in carrying the goods of their former maſters on board the
Engliſh ſhipping; and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards refuſing to treat ſoon ſaw their
town all in flames. This, however, was but a ſmall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all the
cruelties which they had practiſed in taking poſſeſſion of that
country, upon its firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. The plunder of this place ſerved to
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the captors; and the ravage made among them, by the ſcurvy, ſtill
increaſed the ſhare of every ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor. This ſmall ſquadron now came
up as far as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama, ſituated on the Streights of Darien. Thus they 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0443100202:162"/> came upon on the weſtern ſide of the great American
continent; and Admiral Vernon was expcted to ſucceed on the oppoſite ſide
nearer home. Thus the Spaniſh Empire was attacked on both ſides; but the
ſcheme failed from Vernon's want of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Anſon, who now only commanded two ſhips, the remainder having
either put back to England, or, being wrecked by the tempeſts, bounded all
his hopes to the taking one of thoſe rich Spaniſh ſhips, which trade
between the Philippine iſlands, near the coaſt of China and Mexico, on the
Spaniſh main. But one or two, at the moſt, of theſe veſſels
paſſed from one continent to the other in a year. The ſhips are made
immenſely ſtrong, large, and carry great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of treaſure and
merchandize. The Commodore therefore, and his little fleet, traverſed that
great ocean lying between the Aſiatic and American con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, in hopes of
meeting this rich prize, which it was hoped would, at this time of the year,
return from the Eaſt, and would amply repay the adventurers for all their
dangers and fatigues. Avarice thus became honourable when purſued through
peril and diſtreſs. But the ſcurvy once more viſited his mariners, now
long kept at ſea, and without freſh proviſions. This diſorder, though
it takes the ſame name, is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that on land. The ſea
ſcurvy is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an univerſal putrefaction, the teeth looſen, old
wounds that had been healed again open, and ſometimes the limbs are ſeen to
drop off at the joints. By this terrible diſorder ſeveral of his men daily
fell, and others were diſabled. One of his ſhips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming leaky, and the
number of his hands decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he thought proper to ſet it on fire in the
midſt of the ocean. His fleet now being reduced only to one ſhip, called
the <hi>Centurion,</hi> of ſixty guns, and all the crew in the moſt
deplorable ſituation, he caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor on the deſerted iſland of Tinian,
which lies About half way between the old and new world. <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0443100202:163"/>
This iſland had ſome years before been peopled by near thirty thouſand
inhabitants, but an epidemical diſtemper coming among them, deſtroyed a
part; and the reſt forſook the place. Nothing, however, could exceed the
beauty of this ſpot. The moſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic imagination cannot form a ſcene
ſurpaſſing what Tinian naturally afforded; greens, groves, caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades,
fields, flowers, and proſpects. This retreat ſaved the Engliſh
ſquadron. All that a ſea-beaten company of mariners could wiſh, they
found here in great abundance; clear and wholeſome water, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal herbs,
domeſtic animals, and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for refitting their ſhattered
veſſel. Thus refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he went forward towards China, paſſed by the
kingdom of Formoſa, and went up the river Canton in order to careen the only
ſhip that now was left him. Being thus far on his way homeward, nothing can
better teſtify the hardy and untameable ſpirit of the Engliſh, than his
venturing once more back into the ſame ocean where he had experienced ſuch
a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of diſtreſs. The Commodore having put his veſſel into good
order, by the aſſiſtance of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, and having taken Dutch and
Indian ſailors on board, he again returned towards America. At length, on the
9th of June, he diſcovered the galleon he ſo ardently expected. This
veſſel was formed as well for the purpoſes of war as of merchandize. It
mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſixty guns and five hundred men, while the crew of the Commodore did
not exceed half that number. The engagement ſoon began; but as thoſe who
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe have always the advantage of thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and as the
Engliſh are more expert in naval affairs than any other nation; the Spaniſh
ſhip ſoon became the Centurion's prize. There were but a few men killed on
the ſide of the Engliſh, while the Spaniards loſt near ſeventy. The
conqueror now returned to Canton oncemore with his prize. He there maintained
the honour of his country, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0443100202:164"/> to pay the
impoſts which were laid upon ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary merchants; and inſiſted that an
Engliſh ſhip of war was exempted from ſuch a duty. From Canton he
proceeded to the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his voyage to
England, where he arrived in ſafety, with immenſe riches. His laſt prize
was valued at three hundred and thirteen thouſand pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and the
different captures that had been made before this laſt piece of good fortune,
might amount to as much more. Upon his return, Commodore Anſon received all
that honour which prudence and perſeverance deſerve. He ſoon became the
oracle conſulted in all naval deliberations; the King after wards raiſed
him to the dignity of the peerage; and he was made firſt Lord of the
Admiralty.</p>

            <p>THE expedition of Anſon took up near three years. The Engliſh,
in the mean time, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on their operations againſt Spain with vigour, and
various ſucceſs. When Anſon had ſet out, it was only to act a
ſubordinate part to a formidable armament, deſigned for the coaſts of New
Spain, conſiſting of twenty-nine ſhips of the line, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an
equal number of frigates, furniſhed with all kinds of warlike ſtores, and
near fifteen thouſand ſeamen, and twelve thouſand land forces. Never was
a fleet more completely equipped, nor never had the nation more ſanguine
hopes of victory. Lord Cathcart commanded the land forces; but, dying on the
paſſage, the command devolved upon General Wentworth, whoſe chief merit
was his favour with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoſe in
power. This, with ſeveral other unfortunate

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ircumſtances, concurred to
fruſtrate the hopes of the <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0443100202:165"/> Public. The miniſtry,
without any viſible reaſon, had detained the fleet in England until the
ſeaſon for action was almoſt over. In the country where they were to
carry on their operations, periodical rains begin about the end of April; and
this change in the atmoſphere is always attended with epidemical
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers. They, at length, however, ſet ſail for the continent of New
Spain; and, after ſome tempeſts, and ſome delays, arrived before
Carthagena. This city, which lies within ſixty miles of Panama, ſerves as
the magazine for the Spaniſh merchandize, which is brought from Europe
hither, and from thence tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported, by land, to Panama, lying on the
oppoſite coaſt. The taking of Carthagena therefore would interrupt the
whole trade between Old Spain and the New. The troops were landed on the
iſland Terra Bomba, near the mouth of the harbour, known by the name of the
Bocca-Chica, which was fortified with all the arts of engineering. The
Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh forces erected a battery on ſhore, with which they made a breach
in the principal fort, while the Admiral ſent in a number of ſhips to
divide the fire of the enemy; and to co-operate with the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the
army. The breach being deemed prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, the forces advanced to the attack;
but the Spaniards deſerted the forts; which, had they cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage, they might

               </gap> attacked the ſtrongeſt part of the fortification, where after
ſuffering incredible ſlaughter, with the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rene intrepidity, they
were, at length, obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tire. <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0443100202:166"/> Bad proviſions, a
horrid climate, and epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fever, ſtill more contributed to thin their
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and to deprive them of all hopes of ſucceſs. It was determined
therefore to reimbark the troops, and to conduct them, as ſoon as
poſſible, from this ſcene of ſlaughter and contagion. The
fortifications and harbour were demoliſhed; and the fleet returned to
Jamaica. This fatal miſcarriage, which tarniſhed the Britiſh arms, was no
ſooner known in England, than the kingdom was filled with murmurs and
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; a meaſure which, if it had ſucceeded, would have crowned the
promoters of it with honour, now only ſerved to cover them with reproach. The
greateſt part of this diſcontent fell upon the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; his former
conduct, which juſtly deſerved cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, was not ſo powerfully objected
againſt him, as this failure, of which he was innocent. It is not vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy,
but misfortune that finds cenſure from man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Beſides, the activity of
the enemy, in diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trade of England contributed to increaſe
the murmurs of the people. Their privateers were ſo numerous and
ſucceſsful, that in the beginning of this year they had taken, ſince the
commencement of the war, four hundred and ſeven ſhips, belonging to the
ſubjects of Great Britain. The Engliſh, though at immenſe expence in
equipping fleets, ſeemed tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lie down under every blow, and ſuffered
one loſs after another without repriſal. This general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content had a
manifeſt influence upon the election of members for the new parliament. All
the adherents of the Prince of Wales, who now lived, retired from the court as
a private gentleman, concurred in the oppoſition to the miniſtry.
Obſtinate ſtruggles were maintained in all parts of the kingdom; and ſuch
a national ſpirit of oppoſition prevailed, that the Country intereſt
ſeemed, at length, to preponderate

            <p>Sir Robert now tottered on the brink of ruin. He was ſenſible
that nothing but a diviſion in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition could give him ſafety. The
Prince was his moſt formidable rival; a Prince revered by the whole nation,

exerciſing. The miniſter's firſt attempt was, to endeavour taking him
from the party; a meſſage therefore was carried to his roya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> highneſs by the Biſhop of Oxford,

               </gap> the Prince would
write a letter to the King, he and all his counſellors ſhould be taken into
favour, fifty thouſand pounds ſhould be added to his revenue, two hundred
thouſand given him to pay his debts, and ſuitable proviſion ſhould be
made, in due time, for all his followers. This, to a Prince already involved in
debt, from the neceſſity of keeping up his dignity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was a tempting offer; but his royal highneſs
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly diſdained it, declaring he would accept no ſuch conditions
which were dictated to him under the influence of Sir Robert Walpole. The
miniſter now therefore ſaw that no arts could diſſolve the combination
againſt him; he reſolved, as an expiring ſtruggle, to try his ſtrength
once more in the houſe of commons upon a diſputed election; but he had the
mortification to ſee the majority ſtill increaſed againſt him by
ſixteen voices. He then declared he would never ſit in that houſe more.
The parliament was adjourned the next day, and Sir Robert being created Earl of
Orford, reſigned all his employments. Never was a joy more univerſal and
ſincere than this reſignation produced. The people now flattered
themſelves that all their domeſtic grievances would find redreſs; that
their commerce would be protected abroad; that the war would be carried on with
vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0443100202:168"/> and that the houſe of commons would be
unanimous in every meaſure. But they were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in moſt of their
expectations. The miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a miniſter is more likely to affect his
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor than himſelf, as a weak reign ever produces a feeble
ſucceſſion. The houſe of commons had been for a long time increaſing
in power, and Walpole, with all his arts, was, in fact, rather weakening than
extending the prerogative. By his method of brib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſition he had taught
the venal to oppoſe him; and, by his increaſing the national debt, he
weakened the vigour of the crown in war, and made it more dependant upon
parliament in times of peace. A part of thoſe who ſucceeded him were
therefore ſenſible of this, and ſtill reſolved to ſupport the crown,
which they regarded as the only declining branch of the conſtitution. Another
part, who cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured from motives of ſelf-intereſt, having now attained the
object of their deſires, blundered on in the former meaſures, ſtudious of
fortune and not of fame. In ſhort, his ſucceſſors purſuing all the
former ſchemes of the depoſed miniſter, preſented the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical part
of the nation with the mortifying proſpect of pretended patriotiſm
unſtripped of its maſk, and ſhewed the little certainty there is in all
political rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings.</p>

            <p>THE war with Spain had now continued for ſeveral years, with but
indifferent ſucceſs. Some inſucceſsful expeditions were carried on in
the Weſt-Indies under Admiral Vernon, Commodore Knowles, and others; and
theſe were all aggravated by a ſet of worthleſs and mercenary
<hi>things,</hi> called <hi>Political Writers.</hi> A claſs of beings firſt
employed againſt <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0443100202:169"/> Walpole, and afterwards encouraged by
him, at the expence, as it is ſaid, of not leſs than thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand a
year. Theſe were men naturally too dull to ſhine in any of the politer
kinds of literature, which might adorn either a ſcholar or a gentleman; and
therefore they turned their thoughts to politics; a ſcience on which they
might declaim without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and be dull without detection. Theſe men, I
ſay, had, for ſome time, embarraſſed the conſtitution, inflamed the
people, and were paid with large pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the crown. It was upon this
occaſion that they exaggerated every miſconduct, and drew fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
pictures of the diſtreſs and miſery which they foreboded to poſterity.
This clamour, and want of ſucceſs in a naval war, in which the principal
ſtrength of the kingdom lay, induced the new miniſtry to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the
attention of the public to a war, which might be carried on by land. The King's
attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Electoral dominions contributed ſtill more to turn the
current of Britiſh indignation that way, and an army was therefore now
prepared to be ſent into Flanders; the war with Spain being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an object
of ſecondary conſideration.</p>
            <p>To have a clear, yet conciſe, idea of the origin of the troubles
on the continent, it will be expedient to go back, for ſome years, and trace
the meaſures of the European republic to that period where we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly left
them. After the Duke of Orleans, who had been regent of France, died, Cardinal
Fleury undertook to ſettle that confuſion in which the former had left the
kingdom. His moderation was equal to his prudence; he was ſincere, frugal,
modeſt, and ſimple. Under him France repaired her loſſes, and inriched
herſelf by commerce; he only left the ſtate to its own natural methods of
thriving, and ſaw it daily aſſuming its former health and vigour. During
the long interval of peace, which his councils had procured for Europe, two
powers, unregarded, now <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0443100202:170"/> began to attract the notice, and
the jealouſy of their neighbouring ſtates. Peter the Great had already
civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Ruſſia, and this new extenſive empire began to influence the
councils of other Princes, and to give laws to the North. The other power was
that of Pruſſia, whoſe dominions were compact and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and whoſe
forces were well maintained, and ready for action. The Empire continued under
Charles VI, who had been placed upon the throne by the treaty of Utrecht.
Sweden languiſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet recovered from the deſtructive projects
of Charles XII. Denmark was powerful; and part of Italy ſubject to the
maſters which had been impoſed upon it by foreign treaties. All, however,
continued to enjoy a profound peace, till the death of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, King of
Poland, again kindled up the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral flame. The Emperor Charles VI,
aſſiſted by the arms of Ruſſia, declared for the Elector of Saxony,
ſon to the deceaſed King. On the other hand, France declared for
Staniſlaus, who had been long ſince elected King of Poland by Charles XII,
and whoſe daughter had been ſince married to the French King. Staniſlaus
repaired to Dantzick in order to ſupport his election; ten thouſand
Ruſſians appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Poliſh nobility diſperſed, and their new
elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Monarch was ſhut up, and beſieged by ſo ſmall a number of
forces: the city was taken, and the King

               </gap>ver-ran the empire
under the conduct of old Marſhal <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0443100202:171"/> Villars; the Duke of
Montemar, the Spaniſh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, was equally victorious in the kingdom of
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and the Emperor, Charles VI, had the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſeeing
himſelf deprived of the greateſt part of Italy, for having attempted to
give a King to Poland. Theſe rapid ſucceſſes of France and its allies
ſoon compelled the Emperor to demand a peace. By this treaty Staniſlaus,
upon whoſe account the war was undertaken, was obliged to renounce all right
to the throne of Poland; and France made ſome valuable acqueſts of
dominion; particularly the Duchy of Lorrain. In the year 1740, the death of the
Emperor gave the French another opportunity of exerting their ambition.
Regardleſs of treaties, particularly the pragmatic ſanction, as it was
called, which ſettled upon the daughter of the Emperor the reverſion of all
his dominions, they cauſed the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Bavaria to be crowned Emperor.
Thus the daughter of Charles VI, deſcended from an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous line of
Emperors, ſaw herſelf ſtripped of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and, for an whole
year, without hopes of ſuccour. She had ſcarce cloſed her father's eyes,
when ſhe loſt Sileſia, by an irruption of the young King of Pruſſia,
who ſeized the opportunity of her defenceleſs ſtate, to renew his ancient
pretenſions to that province of which it muſt be owned his anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had
been unjuſtly deprived. France, Saxony, and Bavaria, attacked the reſt of
her dominions. In this forlorn ſituation ſhe found a powerful ally in
Britain; Sardinia and Holland ſoon after came to her aſſiſtance; and,
laſt of all, Ruſſia joined in her cauſe. It may be demanded, What part
Britain had in theſe continental meaſures? The intereſts of Hanover; the
ſecurity and aggrandizement of that Electorate, depended upon the proper
regulation of the empire. Lord Carteret had now taken that place in the royal
confidence which had formerly been poſſeſſed by Walpole; and, by
purſuing theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0443100202:172"/> he ſoothed the wiſhes
of his maſter, and opened a more extenſive field for his own ambition. He
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected honour from victories which could produce no good; and campaigns,
whether ſucceſsful or not, that could only terminate in misfortune. When
the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament met, his Majeſty informed them of his ſtrict adherence to
his engagements, though attacked in his own dominions; and that he had
augmented the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh forces in the Low Countries with ſixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Hanoverians. When the ſupplies came to be conſidered, by which this
additional number of troops was to be paid, it raiſed violent debates in both
houſes. It was conſidered as hiring the troops of the Electorate to fight
their own cauſe. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, however, who were formerly remarkable for
declaiming againſt continental meaſures, now boldly ſtood up for them;
and, at length, by dint of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, carried their cauſe. The people ſaw,
with pain, their former defenders ſacrificing the blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of
the nation upon deſtructive alliances; they knew not now on whom to rely for
ſafety; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think that patriotiſm was but an empty name. However
injurious theſe meaſures might have been to the nation, they were of
infinite ſervice to the Queen of Hungary. She began, at this period, to
triumph over all her enemies. The French were driven out of Bohemia. Her
general, Prince Charles, at the head of a large army, invaded the dominions of
Bavaria. Her rival, the nominal Emperor, was obliged to fly before her;
abandoned by his allies, and ſtripped of all his dominions, he repaired to
Francfort, where he lived in indigence and obſcurity. He agreed to remain
neuter during the remainder of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he
war; while the French, who firſt began it as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, ſupported the burthen. The troops ſent by
England to the Queen's aſſiſtance were commanded by the Earl of Stair, an
experienced commander, who had learned the art of war under the famous 
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:0443100202:173"/> Prince Eugene; and the chief object he had firſt in
view was, to effect a junction with the army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Prince Charles of
Lorrain. The French, in order to prevent this junction, aſſembled ſixty
thouſand men upon the river Mayne, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Marſhal Noailles,
who poſted his troops upon the eaſt ſide of that river. The Britiſh
forces, to the number of forty thouſand, puſhed forward on the other
ſide, while the French, in the mean time, found means to cut off all the
communications by which they could be ſupplied with proviſions. The King of
England arrived at the camp while the army was in this ſituation; and
ſeeing it in danger of ſtarving, reſolved to proceed forward, to join
twelve thouſand Hanoverians and Heſſians, who had reached Hanau. With
this view he decamped; but before the army had marched three leagues, he found
the enemy had incloſed him on every ſide, near a village called Detingen..
In this ſituation he muſt have fought at great diſadvantage, if he began
the attack; and if he continued in the ſame ſituation, his army muſt have
periſhed for want o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

unprecedented in ancient hiſtory, and that ſerves to ſhew how much
ſuperior the preſent times are in point of humanity to the boaſted ages
of antiquity. Though the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh were victorious upon this occaſion, yet
the Earl of Stair, who commanded, did not aſſume any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from ſuch a
victory; he was unwilling that his reputation ſhould ſuffer for meaſures,
which he was not allowed to conduct; he therefore ſolicited, and obtained
leave to reſign; and the Britiſh troops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from further
operations that campaign.</p>
            <p>Mean while the French went on with vigour on every quarter; they
oppoſed Prince Charles of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, and interrupted his progreſs in his
attempts to paſs the Rhine, gained ſome ſucceſſes in Italy; but their
chief expectations were placed in a projected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of England. Cardinal
Fleury was now dead, and Cardinal Tencin ſucceeded to his place a perſon of
a very different character from his predeceſſor, proud, turbulent, and
enterprizing. France. from the violence of parliamentary diſputes in England,
had been long perſuaded that the country was ripe for a revolution, and only
wanted the preſence of the Pretender to induce the majority to declare
againſt the reigning family. Several needy adventurers, who wiſhed for a
change; ſome men of broken fortunes, and almoſt all the Roman Catholics of
the kingdom, endeavoured to confirm the court of France in theſe
ſentiments. An invaſion therefore was actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

preparations were made for embarking them
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Dunkirk, and ſome other of the
neareſt ports to England, under the eye of the young Pretender; and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>even thouſand of the number
actually went on <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0443100202:175"/> board. The Duke de Roquefuille, with
twenty ſhip of the line, was to ſee them landed ſafely in England; and
Count Saxe was to command them, when put aſhore. The whole project, however,
was diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed by the appearance of Sir John Norris, with a ſuperior
fleet, making up againſt them; the French fleet was obliged to put back; a
very hard gale of wind damaged their tranſports beyond redreſs. All hopes
of invaſion were now fruſtrated; and, at length, the French thought fit
openly to declare war.</p>
            <p>But, though fortune ſeemed to favour England on this occaſion,
yet, on others, ſhe was not equally propitious. The combined fleets of France
and Spain, for ſome time, fought the Britiſh armament under Admiral
Matthews and Leſtock, though with infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior forces, and came off upon nearly
equal terms, Such a parity of ſucceſs in England was regarded as a defeat.
Both the Engliſh Admirals were tried by a court-martial; Mathews, who had
fought the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with intrepidity, was declared incapable of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for
the future in his Majeſty's navy. Leſtock, who had kept aloof, was
acquitted with honour, for he had intrenched himſelf within the punctilios of
diſcipline; he barely did his duty; a man of honour, when his country is at
ſtake, ſhould do more.</p>
            <p>The proceedings in the Netherlands were ſtill more unfavourable.
The French had aſſembled a formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able army of one hundred and twenty
thouſand men; the chief command of which was given to Count Saxe. This
General was originally a ſoldier of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and natural ſon to Auguſtus
King of Poland, by the famous Counteſs of Konigſmark. He had been bred from
his youth in camps, and had ſhewn the moſt early inſtances of cool
intrepidity. He, in the beginning of the war, had offered his ſervice to
ſeveral crowns, and, among the reſt, it is ſaid, to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat of England; but his offers
were rejected. He <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0443100202:176"/> was poſſeſſed of great
military talents; and, by long habit, preſerved an equal compoſure in the
midſt of battle, as in a drawing-room at court. On the other ſide, the
allied forces, conſiſting of Engliſh, Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verians, Dutch, and
Auſtrians, did not amount to above ſeventy thouſand. Theſe were
incapable of withſtanding ſuch a ſuperior force, and commanded by ſuch
a General. The French beſieged and took Fribourg, before they went into
winter quarters; and early the next campaign inveſted the city of Tournay.
The allies were reſolved to prevent the loſs of this city by a battle.
Their army was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and they were commanded by the Duke of Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.
Notwithſtanding theſe diſadvantages they marched towards the enemy, and
took poſt in ſight of the French army, which was incamped on an eminence;
the village of Antoine on the right, a wood on their left, and the town of
Fontenoy before them. This advantageous ſituation did not repreſs

               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0443100202:178"/> an effort at gaining the Britiſh crown. Young Charles
Edward, the adventurer in queſtion, had been bred in a luxurious court
without ſharing its effeminacy; he was enterpriſing and ambitious; but,
either from inexperience, or natural inability, utterly unequal to the
undertaking. He was flattered by the raſh, the ſuperſtitious, and the
needy, that the kingdom was ripe for a revolt; that the people could no longer
bear the immenſe load of taxes, which was daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; and that the
moſt conſiderable perſons in the kingdom would gladly ſeize the
opportunity of crowding to his ſtandard. Being furniſhed with ſome money,
and ſtill larger promiſes from France, who fanned this ambition in him,
from which they hoped to gain ſome advantages; he embarked for Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land on
board a ſmall frigate, accompanied by the Marquis Tullibardine, Sir. Thomas
Sheridan, and a few other deſperate adventurers. For the conqueſt of the
whole Britiſh empire he brought with him ſeven officers, and arms for two
thouſand men. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which ever perſecuted his family, ſeemed no way
more favourable to him; his convoy, a ſhip of ſixty guns, was ſo
diſabled in an engagement with an Engliſh man of war, called the
<hi>Lion,</hi> that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Breſt, while he was obliged to continue
his courſe to the weſtern parts of Scotland; and, landing on the coaſt of
Lochaber, he was, in a little time, joined by ſome chiefs of the Highland
Clans, and their vaſſals. Theſe chiefs had ever continued to exerciſe
an hereditary juriſdiction over all their tenants. This power of life and
death veſted in the Lords of the manor, was a privilege of the old feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
law, long aboliſhed in England, but which had been confirmed to the Scotch
lairds at the time of the union. From hence we ſee, that a chief had the
power of commanding all his vaſſals, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate death was the
conſequence of their diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng. By means of theſe chiefs therefore he ſoon 
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0443100202:179"/> ſaw himſelf at the head of fifteen hundred men; and
invited others to join him by his manifeſtoes, which were diſperſed
throughout all the Highlands.</p>
            <p>The boldneſs of this enterprize aſtoniſhed all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; it
awakened the fears of the puſillanimous, the pity of the wiſe, and the
loyalty of all. The whole kingdom ſeemed unanimouſly bent upon oppoſing
the enterprize, which they were ſenſible, as being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported only by
Papiſts, would be inſtrumental in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring Popery. The miniſtry was
no ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the truth of his arrival, which, at firſt, they
could ſcarely be induced to believe, than Sir John Cope was ordered to
oppoſe his progreſs. In the mean time, the young adventurer marched to
Perth, where the unneceſſary ceremony was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of proclaiming the
Chevalier de St. George, his father, King of Great Britain. The rebel army,
deſcending from the mountains, ſeemed to gather as it went. They advanced
towards Edinburgh, which they entered without oppoſition. Here too the
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry of proclamation was performed, in which he promiſed to
diſſolve the union, and redreſs the grievances of the country. But,
though he was maſter of the capital, yet the citadel, which goes by the name
of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> a ſtrong fortreſs built upon a rock, and
commanded by General Gueſt, braved all his attempts. In the mean time, Sir
John Cope, who had purſued them to the Highlands, but declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meeting them
in their deſcent, now reinforced by two regiments of dragoons, reſolved to
march towards Edinburgh, and give them battle. The young adventurer, unwilling
to give him time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, attacked him near Preſton-pans, about twelve
miles from the capital, and, in a few minutes, put him and his troops totally
to the route. This vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in which the King loſt about five hundred men,
gave the rebels great influence; and, had the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender taken advantage of the
general conſternation, <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0443100202:180"/> and marched towards England,
the conſequence might have been dangerous to the ſafety of the ſtate; but
he ſpent the time at Edinburgh, ſeeming to enjoy the uſeleſs parade of
royalty, pleaſed at being addreſſed and treated as a King. By this time
he was joined by the Earl of Kilmarnock, the Lords Elcho, Balmerino, Ogilvy,
Pitſligo, and the eldeſt ſon of the Lord Lovat. This Lord Lovat was the
ſame whom we have ſeen, upon a former occaſion, truſted by the old
Pretender, and betraying him by taking poſſeſſion of the caſtle of
Stirling for King George. This nobleman, true to neither party, had again
altered from his attachment to the houſe of Hanover, and, in ſecret, aided
the young Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier; ſtudious only for his own intereſt, he exerted all
the arts of low cunning, to appear an open enemy to the rebellion; yet to give
it ſecret aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>While the young Pretender thus trifled away the time at Edinburgh,
(for all delays in dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes are even worſe than defeats) the
miniſtry of Great Britain took every poſſible meaſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat his
intentions. Six thouſand Dutch troops that had come over to the
aſſiſtance of the crown, were ſent northward, under the command of
General Wade; but, as it was then ſaid, theſe could lend no
aſſiſtance, as they were, properly ſpeaking, priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of France,
and, upon their parole, not to oppoſe that power for the ſpace of one year.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this be, the Duke of Cumberland ſoon after arrived from Flanders,
and was followed by another detachment of dragoons and infantry; voluntiers in
different parts of the kingdom employed themſelves

conſtitution and, perhaps, the religion of his ſuppoſed dominions was a

               </gap> terror and

               </gap> field in perſon. The voluntiers of the city were in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corporated 
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0443100202:182"/> into a regiment. The practitioners of the law reſolved
to take the field, with the judges at their head. Even the managers of the
theatres of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to raiſe a body of their dependants for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of
their country. Yet theſe combinations only ſerved as inſtances of the
national terror; for the trading part of the city, and thoſe concerned in the
money corporations, were overwhelmed with dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They could hope for
little ſafety in the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or diſcipline of a militia, eſpecially as
they, every hour, dreaded an invaſion from France, and an inſurrection of
the Roman Catholics, and other friends to the expelled family. This therefore
was the moment for the advancement of the adventurer's enterprize. Had he
marched up to the capital, he would undoubtedly have been joined by ſeveral,
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly attached to his cauſe. But he determined to retreat once more to
Scotland; and thus his ſcheme was defeated. In fact, he was but nominally the
leader of his forces. His Generals, the chiefs of Highland Clans, were, from
their education, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and, from their independency, obſtinate. They
each embraced peculiar ſyſtems, and began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with each other for
the pre-eminence; ſo that after violent diſputes, they reſolved to march
back. They effected their retreat to Carliſle without any loſs; and from
thence croſſed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scotland. In this irruption,
however, they preſerved all the rules of war; they deſiſted, in a great
meaſure, from rapine; levied contributions; and, in the uſual form, left a
garriſon at Carliſle in their retreat; which, a ſhort time after, to the
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of four hundred, ſurrendered, to the Duke of Cumberland, priſoners
at diſcretion. The Pretender, being returned to Scotland, proceeded to
Glaſgow; from which city he exacted ſevere contributions. Advancing to
Stirling, he was joined by Lord Lewis Gordon, at the head of ſome forces
which had been <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0443100202:183"/> aſſembled in his abſence. Other
Clans, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of two thouſand, came in likewiſe; Spain ſent him
ſome ſupplies of money; and, in one or two ſkirmiſhes with the
loyaliſts, his Generals came off with victory; ſo that his affairs once
more ſeemed to wear an aſpect of ſucceſs. Being joined by John Lord
Drummond, he inveſted the caſtle of Stirling, commanded by General
Blakeney; but his forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unuſed to ſieges, conſumed much time to
no purpoſe. General Hawley, who commanded a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable body of forces
near Edinburgh, undertook to raiſe the ſiege. He advanced towards the rebel
army, and rendezvouſed his whole force at Falkirk, while the rebels lay
incamped at no great diſtance. After two days, mutually examining each
other's ſtrength, the rebels, on the ſeventeenth day of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, came on
in full ſpirits to attack the King's army. The Pretender, who ſtood in the
front line, gave the ſignal to fire; and the firſt volley ſerved to put
Hawley's forces into confuſion. The horſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated with precipitation,
and fell in upon their own infantry; the rebels followed their blow; and the
greateſt part of the royal army fled with the utmoſt precipitation. They
retired in confuſion to Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, leaving the field of battle, with part of
their tents and artillery, to the rebels.</p>
            <p>This was the end of all their triumphs. A new ſcene of conduct was
now going to open; for the Duke of Cumberland, at that time the favourite of
the Engliſh army, had put himſelf at the head of the troops at Edinburgh,
which conſiſted of about fourteen thouſand men. He reſolved therefore
to come to a battle as ſoon as poſſible; and marched forward, while the
young adventurer retired at his approach. The Duke advanced to Aberdeen, where
he was joined by the Duke of Gordon, and ſome other Lords, attached to his
family and cauſe. After having refreſhed his troops here for ſome time,
he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0443100202:184"/> his march; and, in twelve days, came upon
the banks of the deep and rapid river Spey. This was a place where the rebels
might have diſputed his paſſage; but they ſeemed now totally void of
all counſel and ſubordination, without conduct, and without expectation.
The Duke ſtill proceeded in his purſuit; and, at length, had advice that
the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had advanced from Inverneſs to the Plain of Culloden, which was
about nine miles diſtant, and there intended to give him battle. On this
Plain the Highlanders were drawn up in order of battle, to the number of eight
thouſand men, in thirteen diviſions, ſupplied with ſome pieces of
artillery. The battle began about one o'clock in the afternoon; the canon of
the King's army did dreadful execution among the enemy, while theirs, being but
ill ſerved, was ineffectual. One of the great errors in all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender's
warlike meaſures, was his ſubjecting undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined troops to the forms
of artful war, and thus repreſſing their native ferocity, from which alone
he could hope for ſucceſs. After they had ſtood the Engliſh fire for
ſome time, they, at length, became impatient for cloſer engagement; and
about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them attacked the Engliſh left wing, with their
accuſtomed fierceneſs. The firſt line being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered by this
onſet, two battalions advanced to ſupport it, and galled the enemy by a
terrible and cloſe diſcharge. At the ſame time the dragoons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Hawley, and the Argyleſhire militia, pulling down a park wall that guarded
the enemy's flank, and which the rebels had left but feebly defended, fell in
among them, ſword in hand, with great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In leſs than thirty
minutes they were totally routed, and the field covered with their wounded and
ſlain, to the number of above three thouſand men. Civil war is in itſelf
terrible, but ſtill more ſo when heightened by cruelty. How guilty ſoever
men may be, it is ever the buſineſs of a ſoldier to remember, 
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0443100202:185"/> that he is only to fight an enemy that oppoſes him,
and to ſpare the ſupplicant. This victory was in every reſpect complete;
and humanity to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered would even have made it glorious. The
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors often refuſed mercy to wretches who were defenceleſs or
wounded; and ſoldiers were ſeen to anticipate the baſe employment of the
executioner.</p>
            <p>Thus ſunk all the hopes, and the ambition of the young adventurer;
one ſhort hour deprived him of imaginary thrones and ſceptres, and reduced
him from a nominal King to a diſtreſſed forlorn out-caſt, ſhunned by
all mankind, except ſuch as ſought to take his life. To the good-natured,
ſubſequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs often atones for former guilt; and while reaſon
would repreſs humanity, yet our hearts plead in the favour of the wretched.
The Duke, immediately after the deciſive action at Culloden, ordered
ſix-and-thirty deſerters to be executed; the conquerors ſpread terror
wherever they came; and, after a ſhort time, the whole country round was one
ſcene of ſlaughter, deſolation, and plunder; juſtice ſeemed
forgotten; and vengeance aſſumed the name.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the unhappy fugitive adventurer wandered from
mountain to mountain, a wretched ſpectator of all theſe horrors, the
reſult of his ill-guided ambition. He now underwent a ſimiliarity of
adventures with Charles II, after the defeat at Worceſter. He ſometimes
found refuge in caves and cottages, without attendants, and expoſed to the
mercy of peaſants, who could pity but not ſupport him. Sometimes he lay in
foreſts, with one or two companions of his diſtreſs, continually purfued
by the troops of the conquerors, as there was thirty thouſand pounds bid for
his head. Sheridan, an Iriſh adventurer, was he who kept moſt faithfully by
him, and inſpired him with courage to ſupport ſuch incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
hardſhips. He was obliged to truſt his life to the fidelity of about fifty
individuals. One day, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0443100202:186"/> walked from morning till
night, preſſed by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and worn with fatigue, he ventured to enter an
houſe, the owner of which he well knew was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the oppoſite party:

<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>The ſon of your King,</hi> ſaid he,
entering, <hi>comes to beg a bit of bread and cloaths. I know your preſent
attachment to my adverſaries, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you to have ſufficient honour
not to abuſe my confidence, or to take the advantage of my misfortunes. Take
theſe rags that have for ſome time been my only covering, and keep them.
You may, probably, reſtore them to me one day, when ſeated on the throne of
the Kings of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               </q> His hoſt was touched with his
diſtreſs; aſſiſted him as far as he was able, and never divulged his
ſecret. In this manner he wandered among the frightful wilds of Glengarry,
for near ſix months, often hemmed round by his purſuers, but ſtill
find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome expedient to ſave him from captivity and death. At length a
privateer of St. Malo, hired by his adherents, arrived in Lochnanach, on which
he embarked, and arrived at France in ſafety,</p>
            <p>Many were the conjectures then, and they ſtill ſubſiſt, as
to the poſſibility of the young adventurer's eſcape. Some were of opinion
that the government gave ſecret orders to the Generals to connive at it;
while others ſtill firmly aſſert, that he was put to death in an
out-houſe, in which a number of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels were incloſed and burnt. Which
ever report be moſt true, certain it is, that the place of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat has
ever ſince been concealed from all the world.</p>
            <p>While the Prince thus led a wandering and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, the
ſcaffolds and the gibbets were bathed with the blood of his adherents;
ſeventeen officers of the rebel army were executed at Kennington-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in
the neighbourhood of London, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in death gained more
proſelytes to their cauſe than perhaps their victories could have done.
Nine were executed in the ſame manner at Carliſle; ſix at 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0443100202:187"/> Brumpton; ſeven at Penrith; and eleven at York A few
obtained pardons; and a conſiderable numbe were tranſported to the
Plantations. The Earls o Kilmarnock and Cromartie, with the Lord Balmerino were
tried by their Peers, and found guilty. Cro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>martie was pardoned; the other two
were beheaded on Tower-Hill. Kilmarnock, either from convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or from the
hope of a pardon, owned his crime, and declared his repentance of it. On the
other hand, Balmerino, who had from his youth up, been bred to arms, died in a
more daring man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. When his fellow ſufferer, as commanded, bid God bleſs
King George, Balmerino ſtill held faſt to his principles, and cried out,
God bleſs King James, and ſuffered with the utmoſt intrepidity. Lord
Lovat, and Mr. Radcliff the titular Earl of Derwentwater, ſuffered the ſame
fate with equal reſolution. Thus ended a rebellion, dictated by youth and
preſumption, and conducted without art or reſolution. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of
Stewart found fortune become more averſe at every new ſolicitation of her
favours. Let pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, who complain of the miſeries of this life, only
turn to the viciſſitudes in that family, and learn to bleſs God, and be
happy.</p>

            <p>A Rebellion quelled, and mercy ſhewn to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, ever
ſtrengthens the reigning cauſe. How it might have been in the preſent
inſtance I will not pretend to determine; whether too much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour might have
been exerted upon the conquered, poſterity muſt determine; actions of this
kind are too near our own times to be either judged of, or talked of with
freedom. Immediately after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0443100202:188"/> was
ſuppreſſed, the legiſlature undertook to eſtabliſh ſeveral
regulations in Scotland, which were equally conducive to the happineſs of the
people there, and the tranquility of the united kingdom. The Highlanders, who
had, till this time, continued to wear the old military dreſs of the Romans,
and who always went armed, were now reformed. Their habits were, by act of
parliament, reduced to the modern modes; the obedience they were under to their
chiefs was aboliſhed, and the loweſt ſubject of that part of the kingdom
was granted a participation of Britiſh freedom.</p>
            <p>But whatever tranquility might have been reſtored by theſe means
at home, the flames of war ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to rage upon the continent with
its accuſtomed violence. The French went forward with rapid ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
having reduced almoſt the whole Netherlands to their obedience. In vain the
Dutch negotiated, ſupplicated, and evaded war; they ſaw themſelves
ſtripped of all thoſe ſtrong towns which defended their dominions from
invaſion; and they now lay almoſt defenceleſs, ready to receive terms
from their conquerors. The Dutch, at this time, were very different from their
forefathers, the brave aſſertors of liberty, in the beginning of their
republic; the individuals of their ſtate were rich, while the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was
poor; they had loſt, in a ſpirit of traffic and luxury, all generoſity of
ſentiment, and deſire of independence; they only ſought riches,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of public virtue. They were divided in their councils between two
factions which now ſubſiſted, namely, that which declared for a
Stadtholder, and that which, with attachments to France, oppoſed his
election. The prevalence of either ſide was almoſt equally fatal to
liberty; if a Stadtholder was elected, they then ſaw their conſtitution
altered from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public to a kind of limited monarchy; if the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
party prevailed, they were to feel the weight of a <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0443100202:189"/>
confirmed ariſtocracy, confirmed by French power, and crouching under its
authority. Of the two e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s they
choſe the former; the people, in ſeveral to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns, inflamed almoſt to tumult and ſedition, compelled their
magiſtrates to declare for the Prince of Orange as Stadtholder,
Captain-general and Admiral of the United Provinces. The vigorous
conſequences of this reſolution immediately appeared; all commerce with the
French was prohibited; the Dutch army was augmented; and orders were iſſued
to commence hoſtilities againſt the French by ſea and land.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee this war diffuſed throughout the whole ſyſtem of
Europe, in ſome meaſure reſembling a diſorder, the ſymptoms of which,
at different times, appear in different parts of the body, remitting and raging
by turns. At the commencement of the war we have ſeen the Queen of Hungary
upon the point of loſing all her poſſeſſions. Soon after we ſaw the
unfortunate Duke of Bavaria, who had been choſen Emperor by the name of
Charles VII, baniſhed from his throne, ſtripped of his hereditary dukedom,
and ever ſhrinking from ſurrounding dangers. We have ſeen the Duke of
Savoy, now King of Sardinia, changing that ſide which ſome years before he
eſpouſed, and, joining with Auſtria and England, againſt the ambitious
deſigns of France, while Italy ſtill felt all the terrors of war, or rather
ſaw foreigners contending with each other for her domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; the French and
Spaniards on one ſide, the Imperialiſts and the King of Sardinia on the
other. Thus Rome, that once gave laws to the world, now ſaw the troops of
Germany and Spain, by turns, enter into her territories; and, after various
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, ſhe, at laſt, ſaw the Imperialiſts become ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The
Spaniards and French loſt the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing armies, notwithſtanding
the excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Prince of Conti their General; and, at laſt,
after a bloody victory obtained over the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0443100202:190"/>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> St. Lazaro, the beautiful city
of Genoa, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d ſided with
Spain, was obliged to ſubmit to the conquerors, to ſuffer ſome
indignities impoſed upon them, and to pay a moſt ſevere contribution.</p>
            <p>The city of Genoa had, for ages before, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained its own laws,
and boaſted of liberty. Beſides its inner wall, it had another formed by a
chain of rocks of more than two leagues extent; but both being built in thoſe
times when modern fortification was yet unknown, it was not thought, by its
Senate, capable of making a proper reſiſtance. Upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, the
unhappy Italians too ſoon found that no mercy was to be expected from the
court of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna, which had ever patronized oppreſſion. More than a million
ſterling was demanded for a contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a tax, the payment of which muſt
have utterly ruined the city. The magiſtrates did all in their power to pay
the exorbitant ſum demanded; and the German troops exerciſed every
inhumanity in exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. The conquerors lived upon the people, and treated
them with an inſolence which was natural to them as conquerors, and as
Germans. The Genoeſe were, at length, reduced to deſpair, and were
reſolved to make a laſt effort for the recovery of their liberty and
independence. The Auſtrians took the cannon of the city, in order to
tranſport them to Provence, where their arms had already penetrated. The
Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeſe themſelves were obliged to draw thoſe cannon which they had once
conſidered as the defence and ornament of their citadel. It was on this
occaſion that an Auſtrian officer ſtruck one of the citizens, who had
been employed in this laborious taſk. This blow ſerved to animate the
people with their former ſpirit of freedom. They took up arms in every
quarter of the town, and ſurprized ſome battalions of the Auſtrians,
ſurrounded others, and cut them in pieces. The Senate, uncertain how to
proceed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encouraged nor ſtopped the citizens, who drove 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0443100202:191"/> the Auſtrians intirely out, and then appointed
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and guarded the walls with the utmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</p>
            <p>This revolution in a little city, the tranſactions of which has
filled whole Folios of hiſtory, ſhould not be paſſed over without
remark; though no longer capable of maintaining its liberties amidſt the
ſhock of the enormous powers of Europe; yet ſtill we find it
poſſeſſed of its ancient ſpirit; only to loſe it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by the
prevailing power of the Senate, which eſtabliſhed their ariſtocracy on
the necks of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, as before.</p>
            <p>In this manner we ſee victory and miſcarriage mutually declaring
for either; all ſides growing more feeble, and none acquiring any real
recompence for the loſſes ſuſtained. Thus, about this time, the
Engliſh made an unſucceſsful expedition into France, in order to attack
Port l'Orient, in which they came off without any honour. The French gained a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable victory at Rocroux in Flanders, over the allies, although it
procured them no real advantage; and it coſt them a greater number of lives
than thoſe whom they obliged to retire. The Dutch, in this general conflict,
ſeemed the greateſt loſers. A vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory gained over the allies at La Feldt
ſerved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to a ſtill greater degree of diſtruſt in their
Generals, than they had hitherto ſhewn: but the taking of Bergen-op-Zoom, the
ſtrongeſt fortification of Dutch Brabant, and which put the French in
poſſeſſion of the whole navigation of the Schelde, threw them almoſt
into deſpair. But theſe victories, in favour of France, were
counterbalanced with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt equal diſappointments. In Italy, the French
General, Marſhal Belliſle's brother, at the head of thirty-four thouſand
men, attempted to penetrate into Piedmont; but his troops were put to the
route, and he himſelf ſlain. The French King equipped an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful
armament for the recovery of Cape Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0443100202:192"/> and, not
diſcouraged by this failure, fitted out two ſquadrons, one to make a
deſcent upon the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Colonies in America, and the other to
aſſiſt the operations in the Eaſt Indies. Theſe, however, were
attacked by Anſon and Warren, and nine of their ſhips were taken. Soon
after this Commodore Fox, with ſix ſhips of war, took above forty French
ſhips laden from St. Domingo; and this loſs was ſoon after followed by
another defeat, which the French fleet ſuſtained from Admiral Hawke, in
which ſeven ſhips of the line, and ſeveral frigates, were taken.</p>
            <p>This variety of ſucceſs ſerved to make all the powers at war
heartily deſirous of a peace. The States-General had, for ſome years,
endeavoured to ſtop the progreſs of a war, in which they could gain no
advantages, and had all to loſe. The King of France was ſenſible, that,
after a victory, was the moſt advantageous opportunity of propoſing terms
of peace; and even expreſſed his deſire of general tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, in a
perſonal converſation with Sir John Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonier, who had been made priſoner
in the laſt victory obtained by the French at La Feldt. The bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of his admirals at ſea, his Generals misfortunes in Italy, the frequent
bankruptcies of his ſubjects, the election of a Stadtholder in Holland, who
oppoſed his intereſts, his views in Germany intirely fruſtrated by the
elevation of the Duke of Tuſcany to rule the Empire; all theſe contributed
to make him weary of the war. An accommodation was therefore agreed upon; and
the contending powers agreed to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs at Aix la Chapelle, where the
Earl of Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich and Sir Thomas Robinſon aſſiſted as
plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries from the King of Great Britain. The treaty which takes its
name from that city, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on the ſeventh day of October, a
laſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of precipitate counſels and Engliſh humility. By this
it was agreed, that all priſoners, on each

               </gap> employed, who, if ſuffered to remain
at home, would only prey upon the community. This was a cold climate, and a
barren ſoil, where the Engliſh had a fort, and a ſmall garriſon, rather
to intimidate the neighbouring French, and repreſs their incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than
to derive any advantages from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of trade, or the cultivation of
the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It was here that a ſcheme was laid for the foundation of a new
colony, which might improve the fiſhery upon that coaſt, and become a new
ſource of wealth to the mother country. Thus did the nation exchange her
hardy and veteran troops for the expectation of precarious wealth. Every colony
taken from the parent country ſerves to leſſen its ſtrength; and all
the wealth imported into it, after it has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moderately rich, being only
uſed as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of luxury, inſtead of invigorating the nation,
tends to render it more effeminate.</p>
            <p>However, it was advertiſed by authority, that all proper
encouragement would be given to ſuch officers and private men, who, being
diſcharged from the ſervice of the government, ſhould be willing to
ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in Nova Scotia. Fifty acres of land were granted to every private
ſoldier or ſeaman, free from taxes for ten years, and then to pay only one
ſhilling a year. Beſides this fifty, ten acres more were to be granted to
every individual of which each family ſhould conſiſt. Every officer,
under the rank of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, was to have fourſcore acres; enſigns were to 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0443100202:196"/> have two hundred, lieutenants three, captains four, and
thoſe above that rank ſix. Such offers failed not to induce numbers to try
their fortunes on that deſolate coaſt; and, in a little time, about four
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand adventurers, with their families, were carried thither; a town
named Halifax was built; and the coloniſts left to glean a ſcanty
ſubſiſtance from an ungrateful ſoil. Since that time, notwithſtanding
all the encouragement this colony has received from the government, the
inhabitants have cleared but a very ſmall part of the woods with which the
face of the country is covered. Agriculture is quite forſaken; and the
ſettlement intirely ſubſiſts by the ſums ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by the army and
navy ſtationed in this part of the weſtern world.</p>
            <p>Here thoſe voluntary out-caſts of their country expected to
live, though hardly, yet at leaſt ſecurely; but, in this they found
themſelves diſappointed. The Indians, a ſavage and fierce people, from
the firſt looked upon theſe ſettlements of the Engliſh as an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon their own liberties; and the French, who were equally
jealous, fomented theſe outrages. Commiſſaries were therefore appointed
to meet at Paris, and compromiſe theſe diſputes; but theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
were rendered abortive by mutual cavillings, and all the arts of evaſion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Mr. Pelham, who chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the buſineſs
of the ſtate, and was eſteemed a man of candour and capacity, laid a
ſcheme for lightening the immenſe load of debt that was laid upon the
nation. His plan was to leſſen the national incumbrance, by lowering the
intereſt which had been promiſed upon the firſt raiſing the ſupply,
or obliging the lenders to receive the ſums originally granted. Thoſe who
were proprietors of ſtocks, and received, for the uſe of their money, four

               </gap> were purſued by the miniſter at the helm, with

               </gap> whole nation; but, at the ſame time, to be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>intended by
the board of trade and plantations.</p>
            <p>But all the advantages the nation reaped from theſe ſalutary
meaſures, were not ſufficient to counter-balance the ſtroke which liberty
received (as ſome are of opinion) by an unuſual ſtretch of the privileges
of the houſe of commons. As this is a point which deſerves the
ſtricteſt attention, permit me to trace it up to the ſource. The city of
Weſtminſter had long been repreſented by members who were nominated, in
ſome meaſure, by the miniſtry; Lord Trentham having vacated his ſeat in
the houſe, by accepting a place under the crown, he again declared himſelf
a candidate; but met with violent oppoſition. It was objected to him by
ſome, that he had been uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly active in introducing ſome French
ſtrollers, who had come over to exhibit plays upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of
our own. This accuſation, whether true or falſe, excited numbers againſt
him, who ſtyled themſelves the <hi>independent electors of
Weſtminſter,</hi> and named Sir George Vandeput, a private gentleman, as
his competitor. The oppoſition reſolved to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their candidate at
their own expence. They accordingly opened houſes of entertainment,
ſolicited votes, and propagated abuſe as uſual. At length, 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0443100202:198"/> the poll being cloſed, the majority appeared in favour
of Lord Trentham; a ſcrutiny was demanded by the other ſide; it was
protracted by the obſtinacy of both parties; but this alſo turning out in
favour of Lord Trentham, the independent electors petitioned the houſe,
complaining of an undue election, and of partiality and injuſtice in the
high-bailiff of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, who took the poll. To this petition the
houſe paid little regard, but proceeded to examine the high-bailiff as to the
cauſes that had ſo long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the election; who laid the blame upon
Mr. Crowle, who had acted as council for the petitioners, on the honourable
Alexander Murray, and one Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon an upholſterer. Theſe three perſons
were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought to the bar of the houſe; Crowle and Gibſon, after
having aſked pardon upon their knees, and, being reprimanded by the houſe,
were diſmiſſed. Murray was firſt admitted to bail; but, after ſome
witneſſes had depoſed, that he had headed a mob to intimidate the voters,
it was voted that he ſhould be committed a cloſe priſoner to Newgate;
and, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate their meaſures, that he ſhould receive this ſentence
at the bar of the houſe on his knees. He accordingly appeared; but being
directed by the Speaker to kneel, refuſed to comply. This refuſal threw the
whole houſe into a commotion; and it was ordered that he ſhould be
committed cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to Newgate, debarred the uſe of pen, ink, and
paper, and that no perſon ſhould have acceſs to him without
permiſſion from the houſe. This impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he underwent,
ſenſible that it could continue no longer than while they continued to
ſit; and, at the cloſe of the ſeſſion, he was conducted from
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to his own houſe, amidſt the acclamations of the people. He now
was thought, by many, intirely free from all farther proſecution; but, in
this, they were miſtaken; for, at the opening of the enſuing ſitting of
parliament, a motion was made, that Mr. <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0443100202:199"/> Murray ſhould
be again committed cloſe priſoner to the Tower. Hitherto it was
ſuppoſed by ſeveral, that the houſe of commons had acted with a
ſpirit of reſentment. Now it was thought, that they made an attempt at
extending their privileges. Though the delinquent, a perſon of no great
conſequence in himſelf, had taken the prudent precautions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring from
their reſentment, yet ſeveral of the people ſaw that the houſe
conſidered itſelf rather as a body diſtinct from the people, than the
guardians of the people; and, inſtead of maintaining the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the
ſubject in general, attempted to increaſe their own. Some thought they
ſaw, in this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the ſeeds of future ariſtocracy; that the
houſe of commons conſtituted themſelves judges of their own privileges;
and that the liberty of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual in ſociety was at the diſpoſal
of a body who profeſſed acting chiefly for their own honour.</p>
            <p>However this may be, another meaſure was ſoon after taken,
which, in reality, made diſtinctions among the people, and laid an
unpaſſable line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the rich and poor. This was an act for the better
preventing clandeſtine marriages, and for the more public ſolemnization of
that ceremony. The grievance complained of, and which this law was to
redreſs, was, that the ſons and daughters of opulent families were often
ſeduced into marriage, before they had acquired ſufficient experience in
life to be ſenſible of the diſparity of fortune in the match. This
ſtatute therefore enacted, that the bans of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſhould be regularly
publiſhed three ſucceſſive Sundays in the church of the pariſh where
both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had reſided for one month at leaſt, before the ceremony. That
a marriage which was ſolemnized without this previous publication, or a
licenſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Biſhop's Court, ſhould be void, and the
perſon who ſolemnized it ſhould be tranſported for ſeven years. This
act was, at that time, thought <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0443100202:200"/> replete with
conſequences injurious to ſociety; and experience has manifeſted ſome
of them; villains have gone about deceiving ignorant women, under a pretence of
marriage, and then have left them without redreſs. The poor were thus
rendered ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incapable of making alliances with the rich; and the wealth
of the nation has thus been more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to accumulation in opulent families.
It has been thought to impede that ardour which impels many to marry; and to
clog a ceremony of the moſt infinite advantage to ſociety, with
procraſtination and delay. Some have affirmed, that debaucheries and
lewdneſs have become more frequent ſince the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this law; and it is
believed, that the numbers of the people are upon the decline.</p>
            <p>This ſeſſion of parliament was alſo diſtinguiſhed by
another act equally unpopular, and, perhaps, equally injurious to the religion
of the community. This was a law for naturalizing the Jews. The miniſters
boldly affirmed, that ſuch a law would greatly contribute to the advantage of
the nation; that it would increaſe the credit and commerce of the kingdom,
and ſet a laudable example of political toleration. Many others, however,
were of very different ſentiments; they ſaw that greater favour was
ſhewn, by this bill, to Jews, than to ſome other ſects profeſſing the
Chriſtian religion; that an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of this people into the kingdom
would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the character of the nation, and cool the zeal of the natives
already too lukewarm. However, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all oppoſition, this bill
was paſſed into a law; nor was it till the enſuing ſeſſion of
parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it was thought neceſſary to be repealed.</p>
            <p>An act, equally unpopular with the two former, was now alſo
paſſed, which contained regulations for the better preſerving the game.
By this none but men already poſſeſſed of a ſtated fortune, had a
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of carrying a gun, or deſtroying game, though 
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0443100202:201"/> even upon the grounds which he himſelf rented. This
totally damped all that martial ſpirit among the lower orders of mankind, by
preventing their hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thoſe arms which might one day be neceſſary to
defend their country; and gave the rich the ſole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a pleaſure,
which, before, had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the common privilege of humanity. Such
were the laws paſſed this ſeſſion; through all which a ſpirit of
ariſtocracy was diſcerned by ſome. The body of the rich no longer fearing
oppreſſion from the throne, or an infringement of their own liberties, now
began to lean heavy upon the poor, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the intereſts of that
uſeful part of ſociety, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſtinct from their own. They never
omitted, however, the uſual addreſſes to the throne; and this
ſeſſion was remarkable for an addreſs of thanks to his Majeſty for
maintaining, and rendering perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, the general tranquility of Europe, at a
time when war was kindling in almoſt every quarter of the world.</p>

            <p>IF we ſeek for the origin of that war which now threatened
univerſal devaſtation, we ſhall find it kindling up in ſeveral
countries, both of Europe, America, and Aſia, at one and the ſame time.
Moſt other national conteſts have ariſen from ſome one principal
cauſe; but this war ſeems to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the concurrence of
ſeveral, or it may be conſidered as the continuance of the late war, which
had not been effectually extinguiſhed by the defective treaty of Aix la
Chapelle.</p>
            <p>In Aſia, upon the coaſt of Malabar, the Engliſh and French had
never ceaſed hoſtilities. The claim <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0443100202:202"/> of Pruſſia
and Auſtria, upon the territories of Sileſia, had never been thoroughly
adjuſted. The limits of Nova Scotia, inhabited by the Engliſh, and bordered
upon by the French, were never preciſely determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, ſouthward, the
boundaries of Acadia, an extended country belonging to the French, and
bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon Virginia, were equally left uncertain. Negotiations had long
been carried on to determine theſe differences; but what could reaſon do in
deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining diſputes in which there were no certain prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to be guided
by? The limits of theſe countries had never been ſettled; for they were,
before this time, thought too remote, or too inſignificant, to employ much
attention. And it was not probable that powers who had no other right to the
countries in diſpute, but that of invaſion, would have equity enough to
agree upon ſharing the ſpoil.</p>
            <p>The right which any of the contending powers pretended to, might, in
the eye of reaſon, be thought very controvertible; but the convenience which
either party was to derive from the enjoyment of their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar claims was not
ſo uncertain. As the diſſenſions ſeemed to begin in North America, we
muſt turn to that country to conſider their riſe. The French had been the
firſt cultivators of Nova Scotia, and, by great induſtry and long
perſeverance, rendered the ſoil, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally barren, ſomewhat fertile, and
capable of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining nature with very little aſſiſtance from
Europe. This country, however, had frequently changed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, until the
Engliſh were acknowledged as the rightful poſſeſſors by the treaty of
Utrecht. The poſſeſſion of this country, in any other nation, would
expoſe our colonies to perpetual invaſion, and aſſiſt them in
acquiring a ſuperiority in commerce, and the northern fiſheries. It has
been already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that we had an infant colony upon that coaſt, which
was chiefly ſupported by royal bounty, and ſtruggled with all the
diſadvantages of the ſevere cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0443100202:203"/> and the
ungrateful ſoil. But it had an ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtruction to its growth ſtill more
formidable than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The French, who had been long ſettled in the back
parts of the country, continually ſpirited up the Indians to repel the new
comers; ſo that ſome of them were actually murdered, or ſold to the
French at Louiſburg. Theſe violations were complained of, and complaint
produced recrimination; ſo that the two powers of France and England were
negotiating with, accuſing, and deſtroying each other all at one time.</p>
            <p>Now alſo began to be obſerved another ſource of diſpute,
which promiſed as much uneaſineſs as the former. The French, pretending
firſt to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the mouth of the river Miſſiſſippi,
claimed the whole adjacent country towards New Mexico on the eaſt, quite to
the Apalachian Mountains on the weſt. And finding ſeveral Engliſhmen, who
had ſettled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theſe mountains, both from motives of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and
invited by the natural beauties of the country, they drove them away, and built
ſuch forts as could command the whole country around. It was now, therefore,
ſeen, that their intentions were to ſurround the Engliſh colonies which
lay along the ſhore, by taking poſſeſſion of the internal parts of
the country that lay on the back of our ſettlements; and being already
poſſeſſed of the northern and ſouthern ſhores, thus incloſe to us
on every ſide, and ſecure to themſelves all trade with the natives of the
country. The Engliſh therefore juſtly apprehended, that if the French were
able to unite their northern colonies, which were traded into by the river St.
Lawrence, to their ſouthern, which were acceſſible by the river
Miſſiſſippi, they muſt, in time, become maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the whole
territory; and, by having a wide country to increaſe in, would ſoon
multiply, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every year more dangerous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0443100202:204"/> The government of England having long
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of theſe incroachments, determined, at length, to repel force by
force, and to cut the knot of nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, which they could not untie. Orders
were diſpatched to the governors of the provinces to unite into a confederacy
for their mutual ſecurity; and, if poſſible, to bring the Indians over to
their cauſe. The Indians were a fierce ſavage people, unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with
the arts, but from infancy trained to the practice of war. It had long been the
method of the Engliſh to cultivate their friendſhip in times of danger, but
to ſlight their alliance in circumſtances of tranquility; this, in ſome
meaſure, ſerved to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their affections from our government; but the
fraud and avarice of our merchants, particularly that called the <hi>Ohio
company,</hi> who ſold them bad merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes, and treated them with equal
inſolence and perfidy, ſerved to confirm their averſion. Beſides, there
was ſomething in the diſpoſition of the French ſettlers in theſe
regions more ſimilar to theirs; the French, like the natives, were hardy,
enterpriſing, and poor; they naturally therefore joined with thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
from conquering of whom they could expect no plunder; and declared againſt
the Engliſh coloniſts, who were rich, frugal, and laborious, and whoſe
ſpoils they conſequently were the more deſirous to ſhare.</p>
            <p>Thus then the Engliſh had not only the French, but almoſt the
whole body of the Indian nations to oppoſe; yet this confederacy againſt
them did not give a greater union to the different provinces, whoſe
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it was to oppoſe. Some of the provinces, who, from their
ſituation, had little to fear from the enemy, or little advantages to expect
from victory, declined furniſhing their ſhare of the ſupplies, the
governors of ſome other colonies, who had been men of broken fortunes, and
had come from their native country to retrieve them by acts of rapacity and
oppreſſion <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0443100202:205"/> here, were ſo much dreaded, or hated,
that they loſt all influence in inſpiring the coloniſts with a proper
ſpirit of defence. The miniſtry, however, at home, began to exert itſelf
for their defence, and their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were haſtened by hoſtilities
already commenced, there having been, for ſome time, a ſkirmiſhing
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween General Lawrence to the north, and Colonel Waſhington to the
ſouth, with parties of the French, in which the latter were victorious. It
would be tedious, as well as uninforming, to relate all the preparations that
now began to be made by either party; or to load this account with barbarous
names and unimportant marches; or to recount the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate victories and
defeats of either ſide; be it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to obſerve, that they ſeemed,
in ſome meaſure, to have imbibed the ferocity of manners of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
people, with whom they fought, and exerciſed various cruelties, either from a
ſpirit of repriſal or revenge.</p>
            <p>Four operations were undertaken by the Engliſh at the ſame time;
one commanded by Colonel Monck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, to drive the French from the incroachments
they had made upon the province of Nova Scotia; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſouth,
againſt Crown Point, under the command of General Johnſon; a third
commanded by General Shirley, againſt Niagara; and a fourth, ſtill farther
to the ſouth, againſt Du Queſne, under the conduct of General Braddock.
In theſe reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive expeditions Monckton was ſucceſsful; Johnſon
victorious, though without effect; Shirley was thought dilatory, and his
expedition deferred to another ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon! but the fortunes of Braddock are
ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary as to require a more ample detail. This Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was
recommended to this ſervice by the Duke of Cumberland, who was juſtly
ſenſible of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and knowledge in the art of war. Theſe two
advantages, however, which, upon other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are thought the higheſt
requiſites of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0443100202:206"/> were, in ſome meaſure,
conducive to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander's overthrow. His courage made him obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
and his ſkill in war was improper to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted in a country where there
were no regular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to be made, nor a marſhalled enemy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.
This brave but unfortunate man ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon the expedition in June, and
left Fort Cumberland on the tenth, at the head of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred
men, directing his march to that part of the country where General Waſhington
had been defeated the year before. Upon his arrival there he was informed, that
the French at fort Du Queſne expected a reinforcement of five hundred men; he
therefore reſolved, with all haſte, to advance, and attack them, before
they became too powerful by this aſſiſtance. Leaving, therefore, Colonel
Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, with eight hundred men, to bring up the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſtores, and
heavy baggage, as faſt as the nature of the ſervice would permit, he
marched forward with the reſt of his army through a country equally
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous from its foreſts and ſavage inhabitants; a country where
Europeans had never before attempted to penetrate, wild, ſolitary, and
hideous. Still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he went forward with intrepidity, through the
deſarts of Oſwego, regardleſs of the enemy's attempts, taking no care
previouſly to explore the woods or thickets, as if the nearer he approached
the enemy, the leſs regardleſs he was of danger. At length, on the eighth
of July, he encamped within ten miles of the fort Du Queſne, which he
intended to attack, and the next day reſumed his march, without ſo much as
endeavouring to get intelligence of an enemy he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. With this
confidence he was marching forward; his ſoldiers promiſed themſelves a
ſpeedy ceſſation from their harraſſing march, and all things ſeemed
to promiſe ſucceſs, when the whole army was at once aſtoniſhed by a
general diſcharge of arms, from an unſeen ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0443100202:207"/>
along the front and left flank. It was now too late to think of retreating; his
whole body had paſſed into the defile, which the enemy had artfully
permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before they attempted to fire. His van guard therefore fell back, in
conſternation, upon the main body; and the pannic ſoon became general. The
officers alone diſdained to fly, while Braddock himſelf, at their head,
diſcovered the greateſt intrepidity, and the higheſt imprudence; he never
thought of retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but obſtinately continued on the ſpot where he was,
and gave orders to the few brave men who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, to form according
to the rules of war, and regularly advance againſt the enemy. An
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt to the diſcipline of the field, he deſired to bring the
ſpirit of a German campaign into the wilds of Niagara. In the mean time, his
officers fell thick about him, while he ſtill continued to iſſue out
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with compoſure, though he had five horſes ſhot under him, and
though the whole body of his troops was fled. At length he received a
muſket-ſhot through the lungs, he dropped, and a total confuſion
enſued. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage, of the army, were left to
the enemy; the General's cabinet of letters alſo ſhared the ſame fate;
and the loſs of the Engliſh, in this unhappy ſurprize, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
ſeven hundred men; and the remainder of the army, ſome time after, returned
to Philadelphia. It was in this manner the expedition of General Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock
terminated; from which England had expected ſuch advantages. In all actions,
that excite the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and admiration of mankind, a part of their
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is owing to conduct, and a part to fortune. Of the latter Braddock
was totally forſaken; he was unſucceſsful; and the ungrateful world are
unwilling to grant him the former.</p>
            <p>Thus unfortunate were the beginnings of this war, with regard to
England; it was reſolved therefore, that no meaſures were now to be
preſerved with the <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0443100202:208"/> French; and orders were given to
take their ſhips wherever found, though there was yet no formal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of war. With this order the naval com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders very readily and willingly
complied, ſo that ſoon the Engliſh ports were filled with ſhips taken
from the enemy, and kept as an indemnification for theſe forts which the
enemy had unjuſtly poſſeſſed themſelves of in America. The French
complained loudly againſt the injuſtice of this proceeding; they
repreſented it to the reſt of Europe, as a breach of that faith which
ſhould be obſerved among nations, as a piratical meaſure, diſgraceful
to the moſt ſavage nation. Their memorials were anſwered by the
Engliſh, with ſome ſhew of reaſon. However, it muſt be owned, that as
a declaration of war was a ceremony eaſily performed, it would have been more
conſiſtent with the honour of the miniſtry, to have purſued the uſual
methods of conteſt which had been long eſtabliſhed in Europe. The truth
is, that the miniſtry were now divided between peace and war; they ſaw the
neceſſity of vigorous meaſures, but they were afraid to throw off the
maſk of peace intirely. Henry Pelham, who had long guided at the helm of
affairs with candour and capacity, had for ſome time been dead, and his place
ſupplied by Sir Thomas Robinſon, who, though a ſenſible miniſter, and
a favourite of the King, was of no great weight in council, and,
conſequently, ſoon under a neceſſity of reſigning; and Mr. Fox was
put in his place. The adminiſtration was alſo new formed, in other
reſpects, by the taking in ſeveral other new mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Thoſe who had long
been in the miniſtry, were, it is thought, for peace; thoſe, on the
contrary, who were newly taken into the direction of affairs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to
ſupplant their rivals by an oppoſite ſyſtem, and were conſequently
for war. The leader of this party, therefore, warmly ſolicited for war,
ſeconded by the juſtice of the cauſe, and the general voice of 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0443100202:209"/> the people, thoſe who oppoſed him expected to effect
by negotiation whatever arms could atchieve. Whatever might have been the
motives for protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the declaration, the French ſeemed to convince
Europe of their moderation upon this attack by ſea, by neither declaring war,
nor making any repriſals by ſea. However, they threatened England with a
formidable invaſion; ſeveral bodies of troops moved to the coaſts
adjacent to ours; their miniſters threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened loudly in foreign courts; and
ſuch preparations were made as ſhewed a reſolution of carrying the war
into the heart of Great Britain. Theſe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations had the deſired
effect, filling the nation with conſternation, turbulence, and clamour. The
people ſaw themſelves expoſed without arms, leaders, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
while the miniſtry were timid, unpopular, and wavering. In this ſituation
the Dutch were applied to for ſix thouſand men, which, by treaty, they were
to ſend England, in caſe of its being threatened with an invaſion. Which
demand, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by affected delays, was put off ſo long, that the King,
unwilling to come to an open rupture with the republic, deſiſted from it;
for which they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Majeſty thanks. Such are the advantages England
is to expect, by relying on aſſiſtance from any other quarter than its
native ſtrength and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity; and every day ſeems to convince us of the
abſurdity of political alliances, which are never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as wanting
friendſhip to bind, or force to compel.</p>
            <p>In this timid ſituation the miniſtry were eager to catch at any
aſſiſtance; a body therefore of Heſſians and Hanoverians, amounting
to about ten thouſand, were brought over to protect about as many millions of
Engliſhmen, who, with ſwords in their hands, were able to defend
themſelves; but ſuch was the vile complexion of this period, that the whole
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom preſented nothing but one picture of diſcontent, 
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0443100202:210"/> terror, and diſtruſt of their leaders. The
miniſtry was execrated for having reduced the nation to ſuch
circumſtances of diſgrace, as to be thought to ſtand in need of
preſervation from a few German merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries; but what could be expected from
ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, who were poſſeſſed neither of the arts, nor the
integrity of government.</p>
            <p>However, the French were by no means ſerious in this intended
deſcent; the only deſign was to draw off the attention of the Engliſh
miniſtry from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition which was actually going forward againſt
Minorca, an iſland in the Mediterranean, which we had formerly taken from
Spain, and had been ſecured to us by repeated treaties. But the miniſtry of
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were too much infected with the more domeſtic terror, to take
ſufficient precautions to guard this place, though they had early notice of
the enemies intentions. Inſtead therefore of ſufficiently guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
iſland with a proper garriſon in St. Philip's caſtle, the citadel, or of
detaching a ſquadron that, in all reſpects, ſhould be ſuperior to the
French fleet in the Mediterranean, they only ſent ten men of war upon this
ſervice, poorly manned, and indifferently provided, under the command of
Admiral Byng, whoſe character in the navy was by no means eſtabliſhed,
and orders to reinforce the garriſon of St. Philip's with one battalion from
Gibraltar; with which command, however, the governor of that place thought it
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to comply.</p>
            <p>The Admiral ſent upon this ſervice reinforced his fleet by a
detachment of men at Gibraltar; and, ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Minorca, was joined in
the way by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man of war, from whom he learned that Minorca was actually
beſieged, and the French fleet deſtined to ſupport the operations by
land. He ſoon knew the reality of this information, when, approaching the
iſland, he ſaw the French banners diſplayed, and the batteries opened
upon the caſtle of St. Philip's, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0443100202:211"/> which ſtill
diſplayed the Engliſh flag. The appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the French fleet, ſoon
after, ſtill more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged his attention; he drew up his ſhips
in line of battle, and determined to act upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. Byng had been
formerly thought to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in naval operations, to which he was early
bred, but he had hitherto exhibited no proofs of courage. Men are generally
moſt apt to pride themſelves upon thoſe talents for which they are moſt
praiſed; and this was the caſe with this unfortunate commander; he
ſacrificed his reputation for courage, to the hopes of being applauded for
his conduct. The French fleet advanced; a part of the Engliſh fleet engaged;
the Admiral ſtill kept aloof, giving prudent reaſons for his
remiſſneſs in coming to action; till, at length, the French Admiral,
taking the advantage of the Engliſhman's heſitation, ſailed ſlowly away
to join the van of his fleet, which had been already diſcomfited. The
Engliſh, for a while, continued the purſuit; but the opportunity of coming
to a cloſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was now loſt, and never preſented itſelf
again.</p>
            <p>Byng was ſtill reſolved to act with his uſual cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he
called a council of war, wherein it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented that he was much
inferior to the enemy in ſhips and men; that the relief of Minorca was
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable; and that it was moſt adviſeable to ſail back to
Gibraltar, which might require immediate protection. This repreſentation was
almoſt unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed to, and put accordingly in execution. His
puſillanimous conduct, however, ſoon reached his native country, where it
excited almoſt a phrenzy of reſentment. The miniſtry were alſo thought
to fan the flame, which ſerved to turn the public eye from their own
miſconduct in ſending ſo weak an armament. Byng, in the mean time,
remained at Gibraltar, no way ſuſpecting the ſtorm that was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
over his head; but talked, and wrote, even as if he expected the thanks of his
King, and the <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0443100202:212"/> applauſe of his countrymen; but he was
ſoon awaked from this dream of infatuation, by a letter from the miniſtry,
giving him notice, that he was recalled; and another ſoon after, by which
directions were given that he ſhould be ſent home under arreſt; and, upon
his arrival in England, he was committed cloſe priſoner in Greenwich
hoſpital. Numberleſs arts were uſed to inflame the populace againſt
this unhappy man; and, long before his tryal, ſeveral addreſſes were
ſent up, from different counties, crying out for juſtice againſt the
delinquent. The induſtry of his friends, however, was not remiſs upon this
occaſion; they expoſtulated with the multitude, and attempted to divert the
whole of univerſal hatred upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, who, at worſt, only
deſerved a ſhare. But, ſoon after the news of the ſurrender of fort St.
Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip to the French inflamed the people beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This
fortreſs had been reckoned, next to Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar, the ſtrongeſt in Europe,
the works having been planned by the celebrated Vauban; and, both from the
nature of the ſoil, which was one ſolid rock, and the peculiarity of the
ſituation, it was thought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impregnable. In order to make
themſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of this important fortreſs; the French, under the
command of the Duke de Richelieu, had landed near twenty thouſand men, which,
by continual aſſault, and having, at length, gained an outwork, made
themſelves maſters of the place. The Engliſh gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, General Blakeney,
however, had very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms of capitulation, and marched out with all
the enſigns of war. Yet, perhaps, in truth, the harder the conditions a
garriſon is obliged to accept, the more honourable to the commander, as they
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note his extremity in being reduced to accept of them.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh now ſaw themſelves every-where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated; in
America their armies were cut in pieces; in Europe their garriſons taken, the
people trembling <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0443100202:213"/> under the dread of an invaſion, a few

               </gap> the
ſame time, recommended him to mercy; as they could not tell the motives of
his keeping aloof. By ſuch a ſentence they expected to have ſatisfied the
national animoſity againſt him, and yet to ſcreen themſelves from the
conſciouſneſs of ſeverity. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the government might wiſh to do
is uncertain; but the cry of vengeance was too loud to be diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded! his
Majeſty therefore referred the ſentence to the twelve Judges, who were
unanimouſly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the ſentence was legal; wherefore the King
reſolved that he ſhould ſuffer the extremity of the law. Still, however,
there was another attempt made <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0443100202:214"/> to ſave him: One of
thoſe who had been his Judges at Portſmouth, and was alſo a member of the
houſe of commons, informed that aſſembly, that he, as well as ſome
others who had ſat upon the Admiral's tryal, deſired to be releaſed from
the oath of ſecrecy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon Courts-Martial, that they might
diſcloſe the grounds on which ſentence of death had paſſed upon
Admiral Byng, and, perhaps, diſcover ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as might ſhew
the ſentence to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. To this the houſe paid little regard; but his
Majeſty thought fit to reſpite the execution, till the ſcruples of the
Court-Martial ſhould be more clearly explained. A bill therefore paſt the
houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for releaſing them from their oath; but when it came to
be debated among the Lords, and after the members of the Court-Martial were
examined touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their reaſons, the Peers found no reaſon for
paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bill; and it was rejected. The Admiral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus abandoned
to the ſtroke of juſtice, reſolved at leaſt, by the bravery of his
dying, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to ſhew the injuſtice of the imputation of his
being a coward. He maintained to the laſt his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſerenity; and, on
the day fixed for his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the boats belonging to the fleet, being
manned and armed, attended this ſolemnity in the harbour, the Admiral
advanced from the cabbin, where he had been impriſoned, to the deck, the
place appointed for execution, with a compoſed ſtep, and reſolute
countenance. He then delivered a paper, containing the following addreſs:

            <p>EUROPE has often been compared to one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public obeying one law,
namely, that of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and compoſed of provinces, each of which is
prevented from becoming too great by the univerſal jealouſy of the reſt.
A quarrel therefore between any two of theſe is apt to involve the whole in
war; but, particularly, if the diſpute happens to ariſe between thoſe who
are reckoned the leading powers in this aſſemblage of nations. A war begun
between France and England, for a deſart and trackleſs wild in the remote
parts of Europe, ſeemed now ſpreading faſt through the whole world; and
the appearance of their commotions revived all the ancient jealouſies and
claims among the reſt.</p>
            <p>The French, at the breaking out of this new war, though they were
ſucceſsful at its commencement, were very ſenſible that they could not
long hold their acquiſitions againſt ſuch a ſuperiority as the
Engliſh were poſſeſſed of at ſea, and the numberleſs reſources
they had of aſſiſting their colonies with all the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for
war. Being therefore apprized that a naval war muſt, in the end, turn out to
their diſadvantage, <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0443100202:217"/> they made no ſcruple of
declaring that they would revenge the injuries they ſuſtained in their
colonies, or by ſea, upon the King of England's territories in Germany, which
they ſecretly hoped would be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his complying with their demands,
or divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engliſh forces, or draining their finances with heavy
ſubſidies, as they knew his affection for his native country. In theſe
hopes they were not much diſappointed; the court of London immediately, to
ſecure the Electorate of Hanover, entered into a treaty with the Empreſs of
Ruſſia, by which a body of fifty-five thouſand men ſhould be ready to
act in the Engliſh ſervice, in caſe Hanover ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, for
which the Ruſſian Empreſs was to receive an hundred thouſand pounds
annually, to be paid in advance.</p>
            <p>His Pruſſian Majeſty had long conſidered himſelf as the
guardian of the intereſts of Germany, and was ſtartled at the treaty. This
was Frederic III, a Prince adorned with all the arts of peace, and whom you
have ſeen alſo acting as the moſt conſummate General. He had learned to
read men, by being himſelf bred in the ſchool of adverſity; and to love
his ſubjects, by having experienced their attachment. He therefore took the
firſt opportunity to declare, that he would not ſuffer any foreign forces
to enter the Empire, either as auxiliaries or principals. This conſummate
politician had, it ſeems, been already apprized of ſome ſecret
negotiations between the Auſtrians, whom he looked upon as concealed
ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the Ruſſians, for entering his dominions, and ſtripping him
of the province of Sileſia, which had been conceded to him in the laſt
treaty of peace. His Britannic Majeſty, whoſe fears for Hanover guided his
preſent councils, now ſaw himſelf in the very ſituation he moſt
dreaded, expoſed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of France and Pruſſia, who could
at once invade and over-run his Electorate, while his Ruſſian 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0443100202:218"/> allies lay at too great a diſtance to aſſiſt
him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, all he wiſhed was to keep the enemy out of Germany; and this
the King of Pruſſia made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of doing, as well as he. From
the ſimilitude of their intentions, therefore, theſe two Monarchs were
induced to unite their intereſts; and, as they both only deſired the ſame
thing, they came to an agreement to aſſiſt each other mutually in keeping
all foreign forces out of the Empire.</p>
            <p>From this alliance both powers hoped great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; the
preſerving the peace of Germany was the apparent good, but each had other
peculiar bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits in view. The King of Pruſſia knew the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians to be
his enemies, and the Ruſſians to be in league with them againſt him; an
alliance therefore with the court of London kept back the Ruſſians whom he
dreaded, and gave him hopes of taking an ample ſatisfaction from Auſtria,
whom he ſuſpected. As for France, he counted upon it as a natural ally,
which, from the long and hereditary enmity with the Auſtrians, could not, by
declaring againſt him, join them to whom they had ſuch various reaſons
for political averſion. The Elector of Hanover, on the other hand, had
ſtill ſtronger expectations of the benefits that would ariſe from this
alliance. He thus procured a near and powerful ally; an ally which he thought
the French, in their preſent circumſtances, would not venture to
diſoblige; he counted upon the Auſtrians as naturally attached to his
intereſts by former ſervices and friendſhip; and the Ruſſians, at
leaſt, as likely to continue neuter, from their former ſtipulations and
ſubſidy. Such were the motives to this alliance; but both were deceived in
every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. And though this alliance aſtoniſhed Europe at that time,
it ſoon produced another ſtill more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. The Auſtrian Queen
had long medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated deſigns for recovering Sileſia, which, in her exigency,
the King of Pruſſia had invaded, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0443100202:219"/> the
aſſiſtance of Ruſſia to effect her purpoſes. By this laſt treaty,
however, ſhe ſaw England joining with Pruſſia in fruſtrating her
hopes; and, deprived of one ally, ſought about, in order to ſubſtitute
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the room. She therefore applied to France; and, in order to procure
the friendſhip of that power, gave up her barrier in the Netherlands, which
England had been for ages acquiring with its blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. By this
extraordinary revolution the whole political ſyſtem of Europe aſſumed a
new face, and it pretty clearly ſhews that events guide the politician, while
the politician ſeldom guides events; or, to uſe words of Tacitus, there is
but very little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the art and its futility.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, this treaty between France and Auſtria, was no
ſooner ratified, than the Empreſs of Ruſſia was invited to accede to
it; which propoſal ſhe ardently embraced. By concurring with their
propoſals, Ruſſia had another opportunity of ſending her forces into
the weſtern parts of Europe, which was all ſhe had hoped by the
ſubſidiary treaty with England. A ſettlement in the weſtern parts of
Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope was what this fierce northern power long want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an opportunity of
obtaining; for, poſſeſſed of that, ſhe could then pour in freſh
forces at any time upon the more effeminate and contending ſtates; and,
perhaps, at length, obtain univerſal Empire. The intrigues of France were
alſo ſucceſsfully employed with Sweden. A war between that nation and
Pruſſia was kindled up, though contrary to the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their
Sovereign, who had the natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of kindred for being averſe to that
meaſure.</p>
            <p>Thus all the alliances which England had long been purchaſing upon
the continent, and many of the treaties which ſhe had been long making, with
all the buſtle of negotiation, ſeemed now deſtroyed. The forces of the
contending powers therefore, now drawn out on each ſide, ſtood thus:
England oppoſed <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0443100202:220"/> France in America and Aſia; France
attacked Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over on the continent of Europe. This country the King of
Pruſſia undertook to protect, while England promiſed to furniſh him
with troops and money to aſſiſt his operations. On the other hand,
Auſtria had deſigns upon Pruſſia, and drew the Elector of Saxony into
the ſame purſuits; ſhe was alſo ſeconded in her views by Ruſſia,
Sweden, and France, while the reſt of the powers of Europe continued
ſpectators of the contention.</p>
            <p>Theſe deſigns of Auſtria, for the recovery of her loſt
dominions, were too apparent not to be early diſcovered by ſo vigilant a
Monarch as that of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia; he ſaw that preparations were making
againſt him by that power in Bohemia and Moravia, while the Elector of
Saxony, under the pretence of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary parade, drew together about ſixteen
thouſand men, which occupied the ſtrong fortreſs of Pirna. The ſecret
treaty alſo between the courts of Ruſſia and Auſtria did not eſcape
his penetration; by this it was privately ſtipulated, that the treating
powers ſhould, in caſe of apprehending any breach of the preſent peace,
unite againſt Pruſſia, and ſhare the dominions of that crown between
them. This he conſidered as an offenſive alliance; the treating powers
alledged, that it was only defenſive. As preparations for war, however, were
carrying on with the utmoſt diligence on either ſide; the King of
Pruſſia, in order to be confirmed in what he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuſpected,
ordered his miniſter at Vienna to demand a clear explication, and proper
aſſurances concerning the preparations he ſaw making. He at firſt
received an equivocal anwſer; but, ordering his miniſter to demand a
categorical reply, whether the Empreſs Queen was for peace or war; and to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a poſitive aſſurance, that ſhe had no intention to attack him
that year, or the next; an ambiguous anſwer was returned to ſo plain a
queſtion, which <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0443100202:221"/> undoubted manifeſted an inclination
for war. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> therefore thought
proper no longer to ſuſpend his opera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions, but to carry the war into the
enemies country<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> rather than to wait
for it in his own. He entere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with
a large army into Saxony, and, in the uſua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtrain of civility, demanded from the Elector a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
through that country, which he well knew the poſſeſſor of it was not
able to refuſe. In the mean time, he diſguiſed all his ſuſpicions of
the Elector's having ſecretly treated with his enemies; and, upon the
latter's propoſing to obſerve a ſtrict neutrality, the King of
Pruſſia profeſſed himſelf extremely pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the offer; but
deſired, as a proof of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his intentions, to ſeparate the
army of the Electorate, for which there could poſſibly be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
in caſe of the neutrality propoſed. This, however, the Elector of Saxony
thought it prudent to refuſe, which was probably what the other eagerly
deſired; for, in conſequence of his refuſal, the King formed a kind of
blockade about the Saxon camp, in order to reduce it by famine; for ſuch was
the ſituation of this ſpot, on which the Saxons had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, that though
a ſmall army could defend it againſt the moſt numerous forces, yet the
ſame diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty attended leaving it, that ſerved to render it
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible to an enemy. Of this his Pruſſian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty took the
advantage; and, by blocking up every place of egreſs, thus cut off their
proviſions, and the whole body was obliged to ſurrender priſoners of
war.</p>
            <p>In a detail of the tranſactions of England it will not be
neceſſary to recapitulate the numerous marches, victories, ſieges, and
repulſes of this great foreign ally. Whatever either former hiſtory had
ſhewn, or even romance might feign, was outdone both by his expedition and
intrepidity. King only of a very ſmall territory, aſſiſted by England,
whoſe ſituation was too remote to give any conſiderable ſuccours, 
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0443100202:222"/> oppoſed and ſurrounded by all the moſt formidable
powers of Europe, he ſtill oppoſed them on every ſide; he invades
Bohemia, defeats the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian General at Lowoſchtch, retreats, begins his
ſecond campaign with another victory near Prague, is upon the point of taking
that city, but by a teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity inſpired by former ſucceſſes, attacking
the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians at a diſadvantage near Kolin, he is defeated, and obliged to
raiſe the ſiege: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Fortune,</hi> ſays he, <hi>has turned her back
upon me this day. I ought to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it; ſhe is a female, and I am no
gallant; ſucceſs often occaſions a deſtructive confidence; but another
time we will do better.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>One misfortune ſeemed to follow another; the Hanoverians, who had
joined with him and England, in the alliance, had armed in his favour,
command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Duke of Cumberland. As this army, which conſiſted of
three thouſand eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, was greatly out-numbered by the French,
they were obliged continually to retire before them. The paſſage of the
river Weſer might have been diſputed with ſome hopes of ſucceſs; yet
the Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verians permitted them to paſs it unmoleſted. Their army,
therefore, was now driven from one part of the country to an other, till, at
length, it made a ſtand near a village called Haſtenback, where it was
judged they would be beſt able to ſuſtain the ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the
enemies numbers. However, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the efforts of diſcipline,
and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſituation, the weaker ſide was ſtill obliged to
retire; and, leaving the field of battle to the French, retreated towards
Stade. By taking this route they marched into a country, from whence they could
neither procure proviſions, nor yet had an opportunity of attacking the enemy
upon equal terms. Unable, by their ſituation, to retire; or, by their
ſtrength, to advance; they were compelled to ſign a capitulation, by which
the whole army laid down <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0443100202:223"/> their arms, and were
diſperſed into different quarters of cantonment. By this remarkable treaty,
which went by the name of the treaty of Cloſter Seven, the Hanoverians were
quite ſubdued, and all the French forces let looſe upon the King of
Pruſſia.</p>
            <p>The ſituation of this Monarch was now become deſperate; nor
could human prudence foreſee how he could extricate himſelf from his
diſtreſs. The French forces, now united, invaded his dominions on one
ſide; the Ruſſians, who, for ſome time, had hovered over his dominions
in another part, all at once haſtened onward to overwhelm him, marking their
way with ſlaughter and cruelty; a large body of Auſtrians entered
Sileſia, and penetrated as far as Breſlau, and turning to Schweidnitz,
ſat down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that important fortreſs, which, after a long ſiege,
ſurrendered. Another army of the ſame nation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Luſatia, made
themſelves maſters of Zittau, and preſſing forward, laid the capital of
Berlin under contribution. Twenty-two thouſand Swedes pierced into
Pruſſian Pomerania, took the towns of Anclam and Demmein, and exacted
tribute from the whole country. It was in vain that the King of Pruſſia
faced about to every invader, though his enemies fled before him, while he
purſued one body, another pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated his territories in the mean time; and
his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, even in the midſt of victory, were every day contracting. The
greateſt part were either taken or laid under contribution, and
poſſeſſed by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and he was left without any alliance or
aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but what the Britiſh parliament might think proper to
afford.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſuccours could, at beſt, have been, for ſome time, but
ineffectual; however, it was reſolved by the Engliſh miniſtry, that
ſomething ſhould be done, and accordingly an enterprize was planned
againſt the French coaſt, which, by drawing off their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their
German enemies, might give the latter <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0443100202:224"/> kingdom time to
reſpire, and call off a part of the French to the defence of their own.
Beſide this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, England alſo hoped to be able to give a blow to
their marine, by deſtroying ſuch ſhips as were laid up, or building in
the harbour of Rochfort, the city againſt which this expedition was
deſtined. The Engliſh miniſtry had kept that object of their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
a profound ſecret; and France was filled with alarms till, at length, it was
found that the fleet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before Rochfort, where it ſpent ſome time in
deliberating upon what manner to proceed. At laſt it was reſolved to
ſecure the little iſland of Aix, an eaſy conqueſt, which, while
performing, the militia of the country had time to aſſemble, and there was
an appearance of two camps upon the ſhore. The commanders therefore, who, by
the badneſs of the weather, were, at firſt, prevented from landing, now
feared equal danger from the numbers of the enemy which were to oppoſe them.
They took into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the badneſs of the coaſt, the danger of
landing, the time the city had to prepare for a vigorous defence, and their own
unfitneſs for any other methods to reduce it but that of a ſudden attack.
This conſideration induced them to deſiſt from further operations; and
they unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to return home, without making any attempt.
Nothing could equal the diſcontent of the Engliſh upon ſeeing this
expedition, of which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch expectations, return
unſucceſsful. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as uſual, a conteſt between thoſe who
plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thoſe who were ſent to execute it. The military men
repreſented it as uſeleſs and raſh; the miniſters exclaimed at the
timidity and delays of thoſe from whoſe vigour ſucceſs was to be
expected. A Court of Enquiry cenſured the commander; but a Court-Martial
acquitted him. This, like almoſt all the former operations, ſerved to
embitter party, and increaſe deſpondence. A great man was even heard 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0443100202:225"/> to ſay, upon a very ſolemn occaſion, that he
believed the commanders of every military operation were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon doing
nothing. The tumult of the people was now ſunk from turbulent clamour into
ſullen diſcontent; they ſaw only gloomy proſpects on every ſide,
their armies deſtroyed, their fleets unactive, their expeditions ridiculous,
and the only ally they had left in Europe, that would fight their battles, upon
the point of being overwhelmed by ſuperiority of numbers. Such were the
beginnings of this war, from which the timid foreboded national ſervitude,
and a total deſtruction of all maritime power, and even the moſt ſanguine
only hoped for a peace that might reſtore them to former equality.</p>

            <p>SUCH was the ill ſucceſs of the Engliſh arms, and of their
allies, at the beginning of this war. Every day the preſs, teemed with
productions which either reproached their cowardice, or foreboded their
undoing. Yet ſtill the hopes of the parliament roſe with their
diſappointments, and every reſource ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to augment with their
expences. Tho' the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies for this deſtructive and hitherto ſhameful
war, were enormous, yet they were raiſed as ſoon as grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The officers
of the army ſeemed rouſed into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour by the national reproaches. Aſia,
however, was the country in which ſucceſs firſt began to dawn upon the
Britiſh intereſt, and where we firſt learned the art of again conquering
the enemy. A war in Europe could not be proclaimed between the two great
powers, without being felt in the remoteſt parts of the globe. This immenſe
tract of country, which was the theatre of an Aſiatic war, comprehends the 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0443100202:226"/> whole peninſula of India Proper. On the coaſts of
this great territory, the Engliſh, the French, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other powers of
Europe, had built forts, with the original conſent of the Mogul, who claims
the ſovereignty of the whole Empire. Whatever his right may be to this
dominion, his power is ſcarce felt or acknowledged in many of the remoter
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and even the Governors or Nabobs, who were originally of his
appointment, have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves independent, and exert an abſolute
dominion over their reſpective territories, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acknowledging his
ſuperiority, either by tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute or homage. In the conteſts of theſe
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, therefore, inſtead of having recourſe to the Mogul for redreſs,
they apply to the European powers, whom they can either purchaſe or
perſuade to aſſiſt them. The war between England and France, in theſe
remote parts, firſt began by each power's ſiding with two contending
Nabobs, and thus, by degrees, becoming principals in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. The
ſucceſs, on each ſide, for ſome time after the treaty of Aix la
Chapelle, ſeemed doubtful, till, at length, the affairs of the Engliſh
ſeemed to gain the aſcendancy by the courage and conduct of Mr. Clive, a
gentleman who firſt entered into the ſervice of the company as a clerk, but
ſoon ſhewed his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents more adapted for war. By his vigilance and courage
the province of Arcot was cleared of the enemy, the French General taken
priſoner, and the Nabob, whom the Engliſh ſupported, reinſtated in the
government of which he had been formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived. The French, diſcouraged
by theſe misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and ſenſible of their own inferiority in this part
of the world, ſent over a commiſſary with a view to reſtore peace; and
a convention between the two companies was accordingly concluded, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting,
that the territories taken on either ſide ſince the laſt peace ſhould
be mutually reſtored; that the <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0443100202:227"/> Nabobs advanced by the
influence of either party, ſhould be acknowledged by both; and that, for the
future, neither ſhould interfere in the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Princes of
the country. This ceſſation, however, was not of long duration; compacts
made between trading companies can never be of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, when there is
a proſpect of advantage to either ſide from their infraction. In a few
months after both ſides renewed their operations, no longer as auxiliaries
but as rivals in arms and commerce. What the motives to this infraction were
are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known; wherever there is trade there muſt be a degree
of avarice; and that is a paſſion too often the parent of injuſtice and
cruelty. Certain it is that the Viceroy of Bengal, from motives of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
reſentment, declared againſt the Engliſh; and, levying a numerous army,
laid ſiege to Calcutta, one of their forts, which was in no ſituation to
endure the attack even of barbarians. It was taken by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault; and the
garriſon, to the number of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty-ſix perſons, were
crowded into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row priſon called the <hi>Black Hole,</hi> about eighteen
feet ſquare, without any entrance for air, except by two iron windows to the
weſt, which, by no means, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a ſufficient quantity for the
ſupporting life in ſuch numbers. In ſuch a burning climate it is
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to conceive the ſituation of wretches thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured and
ſuffocating each other. Their firſt effort, upon finding the danger of
their horrid confinement, was to break open the door; but this being
impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, they endeavoured to excite the compaſſion or the avidity
of the guard, by offering him a large ſum of money for his aſſiſtance,
in removing them to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate priſons, with which he was not able to
comply, as the Viceroy was aſleep, and no perſon durſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb him.
They were now therefore left without all hopes of relief to periſh, and the
whole priſon was filled with groans, ſhrieks, conteſt and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0443100202:228"/> This turbulence ſoon after ſunk into languor and
deſpair; and towards morning all was horrid ſilence and deſolation. Of an
hundred and forty-ſix who had entered alive, but twenty-three only
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and of theſe ſeveral died by putrid fevers upon their being
ſet free.</p>
            <p>The reduction of this important fortreſs ſerved to interrupt the
proſperous ſucceſſes of the Engliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but the fortune of Mr.
Clive ſtill vanquiſhed every obſtacle; a fleet, under the command of
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Watſon, conſpired with his efforts, and helped him in his
victories. Angria, a piratical Prince, who had long annoyed the company's
ſettlements in the neighbourhood of Bombay, firſt felt the weight of our
naval power. This Prince maintained a large number of gallies, with which he
would attack the largeſt ſhips, when he found a proper opportunity; and, by
this means, he exacted a tribute from every European power for a permiſſion
to trade. To ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſuch a dangerous enemy to commerce, Admiral Watſon
and Colonel Clive ſailed into his harbour of Geriah, though they
ſuſtained a warm fire as they paſſed, and ſoon threw all his fleet
and his fort into flames. The next day the fort ſurrendered at diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where the conquerors found a large quantity of warlike ſtores, and effects to
the value of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>From this conqueſt Mr. Clive went on to take revenge for the
treatment of the Engliſh at Calcutta, and about the beginning of December
arrived at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſore, in the kingdom of Bengal. There was but ſmall
oppoſition made to the fleet, or the army, till they came before Calcutta,
the ſcene of former cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; but as ſoon as the Admiral, with two ſhips,
arrived before the town, he received a furious fire from all the batteries.
This, however, he returned with ſtill greater execution, and, in leſs than
two hours, the place was abandoned. Thus, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt 
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0443100202:229"/> of this and the former fortreſs, the Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
poſſeſſed of the two ſtrongeſt ſettlements on the banks of the
Ganges. Soon after theſe ſucceſſes, Hughly, a city of great trade was
reduced with as little difficulty, and all the Viceroy of Bengal's
ſtore-houſes and granaries were deſtroyed. This barbarous Prince,
incenſed at theſe loſſes, aſſembled an army of ten thouſand
horſe, and fifteen thouſand foot, fully reſolved to expel the Engliſh
out of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Upon the firſt intelligence of his march, Colonel
Clive begged from the Admiral a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men from the ſhips; and
ſix hundred ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were accordingly ſoon added to his little army. The
numerous forces of the Viceroy of Bengal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and Colonel Clive advanced
in three columns to attack him. But, though the forces were ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
diſproportioned, with reſpect to number, the victory ſoon declared in
favour of the Engliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. In fact, what could the timid Aſiatic
ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier do againſt European troops, hardened by war, and inured to all the
viciſſitudes of climate. All the cuſtoms, habits, opinions, of the
Aſiatics tend to enfeeble the body, and effeminate the mind. When we conceive
a body of men led up to the attack, dreſſed in long ſilk garments, with
no other courage but that inſpired by opium; with no other fears from defeat
but that of changing their mode of ſlavery; their chief commander mounted on
an elephant, and conſequently a more conſpicuous object for aim; their
artillery drawn by oxen, impatient and furious upon the ſlighteſt wound;
every ſoldier utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with that cool intrepidity which provides
againſt danger, and only taught to fight by the ſame arts that raiſe
their paſſions. If we conſider all theſe circumſtances, it will be no
way ſurpriſing if one or two thouſand Europeans ſhould eaſily
diſcomfit thirty thouſand Indians. And all the heroiſm of a Cyrus, or an
Alexander, in gaining ſuch diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0443100202:230"/>
victories, will no longer be the ſubject of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
            <p>A victory ſo eaſily acquired by a foreign enemy, ſoon rendered
the Viceroy of Bengal contemptible to his ſubjects at home. His preſent
cowardice render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him deſpicable; his former inſolence and cruelty
odious. A conſpiracy was projected againſt him by Alikan, his prime
miniſter, and the Engliſh having private intimations of the deſign,
reſolved to ſeize the opportunity of ſeconding it with all their
endeavours. Accordingly Colonel Clive marched forward, took the town of Cutwa
in his march, and ſoon came up with the Viceroy's army; and, after a ſhort
conteſt, put the whole to flight, with terrible ſlaughter. Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan, who had
firſt incited his maſter to this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, had hitherto concealed his
attachments, either through fear or perfidy; but, after this victory, he
open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſpouſed the cauſe of the Engliſh, and was therefore ſolemnly
proclaimed Viceroy of Bengal, Bahar, and Oriza, in the room of the former
Viceroy, who was as ſolemnly depoſed, and ſoon after put to death by his
ſucceſſor. The new Viceroy was not inſenſible of the gratitude he
owed the Engliſh, for their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in his promotion. He granted
liberally all their demands, ſatisfied them even to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
wiſh of avarice, and took every method to demonſtrate his pride in their
alliance.</p>
            <p>Yet not the Indians alone, but the French alſo, ſubmitted to
Colonel Clive's aſſiduity and courage, ſeconded by the endeavours of the
Admirals Watſon and Pocock. Chadenagore, a French ſettlement higher up the
river than Calcutta, of great ſtrength, and the moſt important of any
poſſeſſed by that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the bay of Bengal, ſubmitted to the
Engliſh arms. The goods and money found in the place were conſiderable; but
the chief damage the French ſuſtained was, in the ruin of their head
ſettlement on the Ganges, by which they had long divided the 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0443100202:231"/> commerce of this part of India. Thus, in one cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
the Engliſh, in ſome meaſure, became poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of an immenſe
tract of country, ſuperior in wealth, fertility, extent, and number of
inhabitants, to many of Europe. Above two millions ſterling were paid to the
company and ſufferers at Calcutta; the ſoldiers and ſeamen ſhared ſix
hundred thouſand pounds, and the Engliſh forces became too formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for
reſiſtance. Yet, perhaps, this remote power will, one day, either ſerve
to drain from the mother-country all its uſeful hands, or our victories will
ſerve to teach the native barbarians to avail themſelves of their numbers,
and, by being frequently defeated, they will, at laſt, learn to conquer.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs of the Engliſh was not a little alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the
French miniſtry at home; and it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that even the Dutch themſelves
entertained ſome jealouſy of their growing greatneſs. A conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
reinforcement was therefore ſent from France, under the command of General
Lally, an Iriſhman, who was reckoned one of the braveſt, yet the moſt
whimfical man in the French ſervice. He had been, from his earlieſt years,
bred a ſoldier of fortune, and carried the military ſpirit of honour to its
utmoſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. Under his guidance the French affairs ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for ſome
time, to wear a better face; he took fort St. David's, plundered a town
belonging to the King of Tanjour, in alliance with the Engliſh, and after
laid ſiege to his capital. Failing in his deſign upon this city, he entered
the province of Arcot, and prepared for laying ſiege to Madraſs, the chief
ſettlement of our company, upon the coaſt of Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel. In the ſiege of
this important fortreſs, a greater variety of difficulties preſented than
he had expected. The artillery of the garriſon was well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, while, on
the other ſide, the French acted with the utmoſt timidity; it was in vain
that their commander exhorted them to proceed, though a <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0443100202:232"/>
breach was made, and lay open for fifteen days, not one of them dared to
venture out to the aſſault. Beſide this, they were ill ſupplied with
proviſions; and the arrival of a reinforcement in the garriſon ſoon
after, ſerved to baniſh all hopes of ſucceſs. After a briſk fire they
raiſed the ſiege; and this miſcarriage ſo intirely depreſſed the
ardour of the enemy, that they appeared quite diſpirited in almoſt every
enſuing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. In this manner, therefore, their affairs went on
declining, not leſs by land than by ſea. There were ſeveral engagements
between the two fleets, in which the French, though ſuperior in number of
ſhips and men, always declined a deciſive engagement.</p>
            <p>But the French were not the only enemies the Engliſh had to fear
in this part of the world; the jealouſy of the Dutch was excited by our
repeated ſucceſs, and the late extenſion of our power. As this diſpute,
however trifling it may ſeem, may, one day, be of greater conſequence than
it appears at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I ſhall be more particular in my relation of
it.</p>
            <p>Under a pretence of reinforcing their garriſons in Bengal, the
Dutch equipped an armament of ſeven ſhips, which was ordered to ſail up
the Ganges, and render their fort at a place called Chincura ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
as to be able to bid defiance to the power of Britain, and thus ſecure to
themſelves the trade for ſalt-petre, which this place afforded. This
deſign, however, Colonel Clive thought incumbent on him, if poſſible, to
defeat; and ſending the Dutch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander a letter, he informed him that he
could not permit his landing, and marching forces to Chincura. To this
meſſage the Dutchman replied, that he had no ſuch deſigns as were
imputed to him; and he only beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged liberty to land his troops to refreſh
them; a requeſt which was readily granted. He made theſe conceſſions,
however, only till he knew that the ſhips which were to ſecond his
operations, were come up the river, and <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0443100202:233"/> then, throwing
off the maſk, he began his march to Chincura, and took ſeveral ſmall
veſſels belonging to the Engliſh, to retaliate for the affront he
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have ſuſtained in being denied permiſſion to proceed.
Whether, upon this occaſion the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutta Indiaman was ſent out to
interrupt their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, or was only purſuing its way homeward, is not
clearly known; but certain it is, that the Dutch commander threatened to ſink
it, if it preſumed to paſs him. The Engliſh captain ſeeing them point
their guns, as if they really reſolved to put their threats in execution,
returned to Calcutta, where two other India ſhips lay at anchor, and reported
his adventure to Colonel Clive, who inſtantly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the three Indiamen to
prepare for battle. The Dutch fleet were not remiſs in advancing to meet
them. After a few broadſides, however, the Dutch Commodore ſtruck, and the
reſt of his fleet followed the example. The victory being thus obtained
without any loſs to the Engliſh, Captain Wilſon, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the
expedition, took poſſeſſion of the prizes which had greatly ſuffered,
and the crews were ſent priſoners to the Engliſh fort. In the mean time
their land forces, which amounted to eleven hundred men, were totally defeated
by Colonel Ford, ſent upon that duty by Clive. A conſiderable part were
killed, and the reſt were made priſoners of war. During this conteſt, the
Nabob preſerved a ſuſpicious neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, ready, as it ſhould ſeem,
to join with the conquerors. Fortune, however, no ſooner deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in
favour of the Engliſh, than he offered them his ſervices, and profeſſed
himſelf ready to demoliſh the Dutch fortification of Chincura. This
conteſt was repreſented in very different lights to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
governments at home; the Dutch declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Engliſh,
oppreſſing all who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to trade in the Indies; while the Engliſh,
on the other hand, reminded the Dutch of their <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0443100202:234"/> former
cruelties, and of their deſire of gain, even at the expence of every moral
obligation. However, ſoon after a negotiation enſued; the Dutch wiſely
gave way to a power they were unable to withſtand. A treaty was concluded,
and peace was reſtored, ſeemingly to the ſatisfaction of both parties.
Such is the preſent ſituation of this conteſt, which, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, contains
the ſeeds of future diſſenſion. The Dutch will, upon all occaſions,
think it allowable to increaſe their power in India to whatſoever pitch
they think proper; and the Engliſh will ever find it their intereſt to
repel them. It may thus happen, that the amity of the two powers in Europe will
not be ſufficient to preſerve unanimity in ſo diſtant a part of the
world. In this manner, while Great Britain puts an end to one war, ſhe often
lays the foundation for another; for, extended Empire ever produces an
increaſing neceſſity to defend it.</p>
            <p>Our ſucceſs againſt the French on the coaſt of Coromandel
was not leſs conſpicuous; our troops were headed by Colonel Coote, a native
of Ireland, a man of prudence and bravery; he marched againſt General Lally,
took the city of Wandewaſh in his way, reduced Carangoly, a fortreſs
commanded by Colonel O Kenedy; and, at length, came up with the French General,
who was equally deſirous of the engagement. It is remarkable enough, that the
commanders, on either ſide, were countrymen; but this did not, in the
leaſt, abate their attachment to the different crowns they ſerved. In the
morning early the French advanced within three quarters of a mile of the
Engliſh line, and the cannonading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with great fury on both ſides; the
engagement continued with much obſtinacy till about two in the afternoon,
when the French gave way, and fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their camp; which, however, they as
quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandoned, and left their cannon, and the field of battle, to the
conquerors. Their loſing the city of <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0443100202:235"/> Arcot was the
conſequence of this victory; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now remained to them of all their
vaſt poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in India but Pondicherry, their ſtrongeſt,
larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt beautiful ſettlement in that part of the world. This
capital of the French Indian power, in the days of its proſperity, exceeded
all other Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean ſettlements there, in trade, opulence, and ſplendor;
and was ſtill the repoſitory for all the French wealth, which remained
after repeated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats. As ſoon as the fortreſſes adjacent to this
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant place were reduced, Colonel Coote ſat down before it, reſolved
upon the blockade by land, while Admiral Stevens ſhut up their harbour by
ſea. A regular ſiege was, at that time, impracticable; from the periodical
rains which in that climate were ſoon expected to obſtruct ſuch
operations. Theſe diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages were even ſufficient to repreſs any
attempts whatſoever; but, notwithſtanding the inclemency of the climate,
the Engliſh commander continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the place for full ſeven months.
Neither rains nor ſtorms were, in the leaſt, able to abate their
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity; they continued the ſiege, and preſſed the garriſon in
ſuch a manner that they were reduced to the moſt extreme diſtreſs.
Lally, however, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely bent on ſuffering every calamity rather
than yield this laſt ſtake of French power in India, though his ſoldiers
were obliged to feed on dogs and cats, and even bought ſuch wretched
proviſions extremely dear, (eight crowns having been given for the fleſh of
a dog) yet ſtill he determined to hold out. In the midſt of this
diſtreſs, fortune ſeemed to give an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of relief, had it been
properly ſeconded. In the beginning of January one of thoſe terrible
ſtorms which are common in thoſe climates, but of whoſe violence we can
have but little idea in Europe, wreck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large part of the Engliſh fleet
that was block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the harbour of Pondicherry. This was a blow 
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0443100202:236"/> which once more elevated the hopes of the deſpairing
garriſon. The General now flattered himſelf with the hope of being
ſupplied with proviſions; and, once more, animated his ſoldiers, long
ſunk with diſeaſe, famine, fatigue, and uninterrupted adverſity. He
immediately wrote to one of the French reſidents at a Dutch ſettlement
ſor inſtant aſſiſtance; his eager impatience appears in the letter he
ſent. 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>The Engliſh ſquadron is no more, Sir. Of the
twelve ſhips they had in our road, ſeven are loſt, crews and all; the
other four diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſted, and no more than one frigate hath
eſcaped—loſe not an inſtant in ſending boats after boats loaded
with rice.—The ſaving of Pondicherry hath been in your power once
already; this opportunity neglected, the fault will be all yours. Offer great
rewards.—In four days I expect ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand
Morattoes.—In ſhort, riſque all, attempt all, force all, and ſend
us ſome rice, ſhould it be but half a garſe at a time.</hi>
               </q> This
ſingular letter, however, was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and, in leſs than four days, he
had the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to behold Admiral Stevens again appearing in the
harbour, who had repaired his loſſes with all poſſible celerity; and
the blockade now became as complete as ever. Still, however, he made no
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal to ſurrender; the ſiege was carried on by his countryman with
redoubled alacrity; and, at length, he found his troops half conſumed with
fatigue and famine, a breach made in the rampart, and not more than one day's
proviſion of any kind remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He was now reduced to an extremity that
would admit of no heſitation; a ſignal was therefore made to ceaſe
hoſtilities; the principal of the Jeſuits, together with two civilians,
came out, and offered terms of capitulation. Lally, however, could not be
prevailed upon to offer any terms; he ſent a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, filled with reproaches,
againſt the Engliſh, to Colonel Coote; and alledged, that he would not
treat with an enemy upon the honourable terms of war, who had already forfeited
his honour in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0443100202:237"/> inſtances. He therefore
ſuffered the Engliſh troops to take poſſeſſion of the place, but
refuſed to ſurrender it in the uſual forms. This conqueſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
the power of France in India; the whole trade of that vaſt peninſula, from
the Indus to the Ganges, became our own. The Princes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try knew the
Engliſh force, and learned to fear it. Since that time nothing conſiderable
has been done againſt us. Our Eaſt-India company have become the arbiters
of Empire. The Mogul himſelf has been defeated, and taken priſoner. The
Britiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire begins to vie even with that of ancient Rome; the extent of
its dominions on land is as wide, and its force at ſea is infinitely greater.
Happy if we know when to bound our ſucceſſes; happy if we can
diſtinguiſh between victories and advantages; if we can be convinced that
when a nation ſhines brighteſt with conqueſt, it may then, like a
waſting taper, be only haſtening to decay.</p>

            <p>VICTORY, which thus firſt dawned upon us, from the Eaſt,
ſeemed to extend even to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope and America. But ſome ſteps led to
theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes which had been long wiſhed for; and, at length, were
effected. The affairs of war were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a miniſtry which ſeemed
utterly unequal to the weight and importance of ſuch a charge; they were but
feebly held together among each other, and clamoured againſt by the united
voice of the people. It had long been their method to rule by party; and,
ſurrounding the throne, it was ſaid, they attempted only to fill the royal
ear with whatever ſuggeſtions they thought moſt to their intereſts.
When any <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0443100202:238"/> new meaſure was propoſed, which could not
receive their approbation; or any new member was introduced into government,
whom they did not nominate, it was their method to throw up their places with a
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret view of reſuming them with greater luſtre. Thus all hope of
preferment was to be expected only from them; public favours were conferred
only for private ſervices; they were thought to govern in the ſenate and in
the field; the ſtrength of the crown was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally declining; that of the
people was ſcarce any, while ariſtocracy filled up every avenue to the
throne with pride, ignorance, and faction.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the King and nation, at that time, was truly
deplorable; the defeat of Braddock in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; the loſs of Oſwego; the
delay of armaments; the abſurd deſtination of fleets and armies, all
ſerved to reduce the people almoſt to a ſtate of deſperation, and
brought addreſſes to the throne from every part of the kingdom. The general
voice was, at length, too loud not to reach the throne; and the miniſtry
were, at length, obliged to admit ſome gentlemen into a ſhare of the
government, whoſe talents and integrity might, in ſome meaſure,
counterbalance their own deficience. At the head of theſe newly introduced
were Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe was appointed Secretary of
State, the other Chancellor of the Exchequer. To draw the characters of men
ſtill living, would neceſſarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject me to the imputation of
adulation or ſatyr; it is enough to ſay, that the people had high
expectations from their abilities; and, in the end, they were not
diſappointed.</p>
            <p>The pleaſure of the nation, however, was but of ſhort
continuance; a miniſtry compoſed of ſuch jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring principles could not
long continue united, being conſtituted of perſons eſpouſing different
meaſures, and actuated by different motives. The old juncto courted the
Sovereign's favour by their pretended at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0443100202:239"/> to his
foreign dominions; the new cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured againſt all continental connexions as
ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incompatible with the intereſt of the nation. Both, perhaps, might
have been wrong; but it is obvious, that theſe ſentiments were ſufficient
to ſink the latter in the royal eſteem; and this diſlike was artfully
kept up, and increaſed by their old rivals in power. A few months, therefore,
after Mr. Pitt had been put into office, he was obliged to reſign the
ſeals, by his Majeſty's command; and Mr. Legge was diſmiſſed from
being Chancellor of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. The old miniſtry now thought themſelves
ſecure in the unmoleſted poſſeſſion of former power; but this very
ſtep which they took for their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity turned out to them as
unfortunate as thoſe they planned for the public were unſucceſsful. The
whole nation ſeemed to riſe up as one man in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that part of
the miniſtry that was lately excluded. And the King, at length, thought
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to comply with the general ſolicitation. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge were
again reſtored, and a train of ſucceſſes ſoon began to dignify their
deſigns.</p>
            <p>For ſome time, however, the meaſures planned by the former
miniſtry were purſued in America; and though the Engliſh were ſuperior
to the enemy, yet ſtill they felt all the inconvenience of irreſolute
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and ill-planned operations. Our women and children in that part of
the world were expoſed to the unparalleled cruelty of the Indian ſavages;
and, what is ſtill more remarkable, two thouſand Britons with arms in their
hands, continued tame ſpectators of theſe inhumanities. Bad ſucceſs
ever produces complaint on all ſides; and England now heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
invective and accuſation. The Generals ſent over to manage the operations
of war, loudly accuſed the timidity and the ſlowneſs of the natives, who
were to unite in their own defence; the natives, on the contrary, as warmly
expoſtulated againſt the <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0443100202:240"/> pride, avarice, or
incapacity of thoſe ſent over to command them. General Shirley, who was
appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that command, had been ſuperſeded by Lord London; and this
nobleman ſoon after returning to England, three ſeveral commanders were put
at the head of ſeparate operations; the moſt important be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that
deſigned againſt Cape Breton, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by General Amherſt. The
taking poſſeſſion of this iſland, and its fortreſs, was a
conqueſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſhed by all our colonies, as it had always been a
convenient harbour to the enemy, which, from thence annoyed our trade with
impunity. It was alſo a convenient ſituation for carrying on their
fiſhery; a branch of commerce of the utmoſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the French nation.
The fortreſs of Louiſburg was ſtrengthened with all the aſſiſtance
of art; the garriſon was numerous; the commander vigilant; and every
precaution taken to prevent a deſcent. An account of the operations of a
ſiege is tedious; be it ſufficient to ſay, that the Engliſh
ſurmounted every obſtacle with the moſt amazing intrepidity; their former
timidity ſeemed now converted into perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolution; the place was
ſurrendered by capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and our troops, long uſed to diſappointment
and repulſe began to boaſt of victory in their turn.</p>
            <p>Two other operations were carried on in America at the ſame time,
the one under General Abercrom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, againſt Crown Point and Ticonderago; the
other, more to the ſouthward, againſt fort Du Queſne; the latter
expedition was ſucceſsful; but that againſt Crown Point and Ticonderago
was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with its uſual bad fortune. This was now the ſecond time that
the Engliſh army had attempted to penetrate into thoſe hideous wilds by
which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſecured the French encroachments in that remote part of
America; Braddock was fallen in the attempt; his raſhneſs contributed to
his defeat; and too much caution, perhaps, was the fault of his
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0443100202:241"/> Much time was ſpent in marching to
the place of action; and the enemy were thus perfectly prepared to give the
Engliſh troops a warm reception. They were found intrenched under the fort of
Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderago, behind a breaſt-work raiſed eight feet high, and ſtill
farther ſecured by felled trees, with their branches pointing outwards.
Theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, however, the Engliſh attempted to ſurmount; but as
the enemy, being ſecure themſelves, took aim at leiſure; a terrible
carnage of the aſſailants enſued, and the General, after repeated
efforts, was obliged to order a retreat. The Engliſh army, however, was
ſtill ſuperior to that of the enemy, and might, it was ſuppoſed, have
gone onward with ſucceſs, if ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their artillery, which had not
yet arrived; but the General felt, too ſenſibly, the terrors of the late
defeat, to remain in the vicinity of a victorious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; he therefore
reimbarked his troops, and returned to his camp at Lake George, from whence he
had taken his departure.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs of this campaign, however, was, upon the whole,
greatly in favour of the Engliſh. The taking of fort Du Queſne ſerved to
remove from our colonies the terror of the incurſions of barbarians, and
interrupted that continued correſpondence, which by a chain of forts, one
part of the French ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had with the other. The miniſtry too
diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a ſpirit of vigorous reſolution hitherto unknown, in this
part of the world; and the next campaign promiſed more brilliant
ſucceſſes.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, in the opening of the next ſeſſion, 1759, the
miniſtry ſeemed ſenſible that a ſingle ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort carried in ſuch wide
extended dominions, would never bring the enemy into ſubjection; it was
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved to attack them in ſeveral different parts of this
extenſive Empire at once. It was therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to attack the French
in all their places of ſtrength at the ſame time Preparations were
therefore made, <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0443100202:242"/> and expeditions went forward againſt
three different parts of the northern continent of America. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Amherſt,
commander in chief, with a body of twelve thouſand men, was to attack Crown
Point that had hitherto been the reproach of the Engliſh army. General Wolfe
was, at the oppoſite quarter, to enter the river St. Lawrence, and undertake
the ſiege of Quebec, the capital of the French dominions in this part of the
world, while General Prideaux and Sir William Johnſon were to attempt a fort
near the cataract of Niagara. This laſt expedition was the firſt
ſucceſsful. The fort of Niagara was a place of great importance, and
ſerved to command all the communication between the northern and weſtern
French ſettlements. The ſiege was ſoon commenced by the Engliſh, but
General Prideaux was killed in the trenches by the burſting of a cohorn; ſo
that the whole ſucceſs of the expedition fell to General John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and
his good fortune. He omitted nothing to promote the vigorous meaſures of his
predeceſſor, but added all his own popularity. The French knew the
importance of this fort, and attempted to relieve it. Johnſon attacked them
with his uſual intrepidity and ſucceſs; in leſs than an hour their
whole army was put to the route, and the garriſon, beholding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of
their countrymen, ſurrendered priſoners of war. Nor was General Amherſt
leſs ſucceſsful, though, without meeting an enemy, upon his march to
Crown Point, he found both that fort and Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derago deſerted and
deſtroyed. There now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, remained but one grand and deciſive blow
to put all North America in poſſeſſion of the Engliſh. This was the
taking of Quebec, a city handſomely built, populous, and flouriſhing.
Admiral Saunders commanded the naval part of the expedition; that by land was
committed to the conduct of General Wolfe. This young ſoldier, who was not
yet thirty-five, had diſtinguiſhed himſelf on many former occaſions,
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0443100202:243"/> in the ſiege of Louiſburg, a part of
the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of which was juſtly aſcribed to him, who, unin debted to
family or connexions had raiſed himſelf by merit to his preſent command.
The war in this part of the world had hitherto been carried on with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
barbarity; and each ſide ſeemed to have adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſavage manners of
the Indians, whoſe country they diſputed. Wolfe, however, diſdained
theſe baſe proceedings, and carried on all the terrors of war with the
humanity of a truly civilized European. A deſcription of the ſiege of this
city may inſtruct a ſoldier, but can ſcarcely inform a citizen; be it
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to obſerve, that its beginning appeared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
unpromiſing to the beſiegers; and repeated repulſes even ſerved to
abate the hopes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I know,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that the affairs of
Great Britain require the moſt vigorous meaſures; but then the courage of
an handful of brave men ſhould be exerted only where there is ſome hope of
a favourable event. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the difficulties are ſo various that I am
at a loſs how to determine.</hi>
               </q> However, he reſolved, though now
ſinking under fatigue and ſickneſs, to make one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous attempt before
he gave up all; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, in the night, part of his troops, with great
difficulty made themſelves maſters of an hill that commanded the town. A
battle enſued; Montcalm, the French commander, reſolved not to ſurvive
the defeat of his country. Wolfe, on the other ſide, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to conquer
or die. Both commanders had their wiſh; both fell; but the Engliſh were
victorious. The circumſtances attending the death of Wolfe ſerved to give
an example like that of the noble The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban. He, in the beginning of the
engagement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound in the hand, which he diſſembled, wrapping it
round with his handkerchief, to ſtop the effuſion of blood; he advanced
with uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: a ſecond ball, was more fatal; it pierced his breaſt, ſo
that, unable to proceed, he leaned on the <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0443100202:244"/> ſhoulder of
a ſoldier who was near him. Now, ſtruggling in the agonies of death, and
juſt depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he heard a voice cry, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>they run;</hi>
               </q> he ſeemed to revive a
moment at the ſound, and, aſking who ran, was informed the <hi>French;</hi>
expreſſing his wonder that they ran ſo ſoon, and unable to gaze any
longer, he ſunk on the ſoldier's breaſt, and his laſt words were, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I die happy.</hi>
               </q> Perhaps the loſs of
ſuch a man was greater to the nation than the conquering of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada was
advantageous; but it is the misfortune of humanity, that we can never know true
greatneſs till that moment when we are going to loſe it.</p>
            <p>The ſurrender of the city was the conſequence of this victory,
and, with it, the total ceſſion of all Canada. The French, it is true,
made, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſeaſon, a vigorous effort to retake it; but, by the
good conduct of our Governour, the town held out till relieved by an Engliſh
fleet, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Lord Colville. Thus did this campaign make ample
reparation for all the loſſes that had been hitherto ſuſtained by the
Engliſh. The French had now no force capable of making any reſiſtance;
they held out the war now, not with hopes of victory, but honourable
capitulation; one place after another was invaded; Montreal, at laſt,
ſurrendered; and, in a ſhort time, a country, which their own writers have
repreſented as being more extenſive than the Roman Empire, fell totally
under the power of his Britannic Majeſty.</p>
            <p>How far the extending dominion tends to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the
ſtrength of a nation, is an object worthy conſideration. The ſplendour of
victory ſhould never dazzle the eye of reaſon. No people ever could call
their country powerful, if it were not populous. For political force depends
upon the ſmall frontier to be defended; and the vicinity of an army to every
place to be invaded; but extended Empire takes away both theſe advantages,
and, before the ſoldier <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0443100202:245"/> can traverſe half his proper
territories, his country may have already felt all the horrors of invaſion.
Whatever joy therefore our country might have felt at theſe immenſe
acquiſitions, of remote territory, I own it gives me no very pleaſing
proſpect. The manufactures, the trade, and the riches of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
countries, can never recompence for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual drain of uſeful and
induſtrious ſubjects, that muſt be derived from the mother country to
people them. Wherever the lower ſort of people in any kingdom can fly from
labour, they will be ready to go; yet, upon the induſtry, and the valour of
theſe alone, every kingdom muſt hope for ſecurity. Not the effeminate,
and the luxurious, can defend their country in the day of battle; they may
increaſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity by their example, but opulence can never give true relief.
The Spaniards and the Portugueſe were much more powerful before they divided
their ſtrength into all the torrid climates of Southern America. The ſtate
thus got riches, but loſt men; they had gold, but could not regain
induſtry. Thus are their nations now incapable of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt powerful foreign invaſion. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe wealth of the Indies that
every year comes home to their ports goes to inrich a few; their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are either in the extremes of wealth or poverty; the rich have only ſlaves
beneath them, who hate thoſe for whom they muſt labour; the poor have no
acquiſitions, nor property, to defend; ſo that their armies are compoſed
either of wretches preſſed into the ſervice, who only ſeek for
opportunities not to fight, but to fly; or of men, rich and noble, courageous
from pride, yet weak from luxury. Such is not, as yet, the caſe of England,
nor will ever be, if a paſſion for conqueſt is not miſtaken for
national proſperity.</p>

            <p>THE ſucceſs of our arms in America was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved by moderate
efforts; on the contrary, in Europe the efforts we made, and the operations of
our great ally the King of Pruſſia, were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet produced no
very ſignal effects. Safety was all that could be expected; and this was
ſecured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all human expectation. You have juſt ſeen that
Monarch ſurrounded by enemies; the greateſt and moſt formidable powers of
Europe; you have ſeen almoſt the whole power of the continent united
againſt, and hovering over, his devoted dominions; and the only allies that
remained to him bound by treaty to retire, and give him no aſſiſtance. In
this terrible ſituation he ſtill adhered to his fortitude, and, relying on
his natural ſubjects alone, reſolved never to abandon his claims. Such was
the deſperate condition of his affairs; yet they were ſtill rendered more
hopeleſs, when he was informed that his only friend, the Monarch of that
generous people which had hitherto ſupplied him with money and ſtores, was
going to forſake him, and leave him to irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable ruin. It was thus he
expoſtulated with the doubting Monarch upon this occaſion: 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Is it poſſible that your Majeſty can have
ſo little fortitude and conſtancy, as to be diſpirited by a ſmall
reverſe of fortune. Are our affairs ſo ruinous that they cannot be
repaired? Conſider the ſtep you have made me undertake, and remember that
you are the cauſe of all my misfortunes. I ſhould never have abandoned my
former alliances but for your flattering aſſurances. I do not now repent of
the treaty concluded between us; but I intreat you will not ingloriouſly
leave me at the mercy of my enemies, after having brought upon me all the
powers of Europe.</hi>
               </q> The French and Imperialiſts, after a
ſucceſsful ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer campaign, were, at this time, which was the depth of
winter, ſat down to the ſiege of Leipſic. His Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Majeſty
dreaded the capture of this important <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0443100202:247"/> city, and ſoon,
unexpectedly, ſeemed to riſe up before it. Such was the terror of his arms,
even vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he had been, that his approach raiſed the ſiege, and
the French, though ſuperior in number, retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He, at length, overtook
them at a village called Roſbach, and gained ſo complete a victory, that
night alone ſaved their whole army from deſtruction. The Auſtrians were,
in another part of the Empire, ſtill victorious, and had taken the Prince of
Bevern, his generaliſſimo, priſoner. The King, after a dreadful march of
two hundred miles, in the depth of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, came up with them near Breſlau,
diſpoſed his inferior forces with his uſual judgment, and obtained
another bloody victory, in which he took not leſs than fifteen thouſand
priſoners. Breſlau, with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of ten thouſand men, ſurrendered
ſoon after, Theſe ſucceſſes diſpirited the enemy, and raiſed his
allies to new hopes.</p>
            <p>After the capitulation of Cloſter-Severn was ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, between
the Duke of Cumberland and the Duke of Richelieu, both ſides began to
complain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions. The Hanoverians accuſed the rapacity of the French
General, and the inſolent brutality of his ſoldiers; while the French
retorted the charge of inſurrection againſt them, and began to think of
treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a conquered enemy thoſe whom they had only bound by treaty as
neutrals. Treaties have never been preſerved longer than intereſt or
compulſion bound them; political faith is a word without mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the French
oppreſſed the Hanoverians; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſumed their arms; and each
ſide complained, as uſual, of infraction. A General was not long want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to aſſemble the collecting army. Prince Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand of Brunſwic put
himſelf at their head, began by ſkirmiſhing with ſucceſs; and, at
laſt, were in a capacity of becoming formidable to their late victors. From
this time the King of Pruſſia ſought the enemy upon more equal terms than
ever; often victorious, <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0443100202:248"/> ſometimes repulſed; but ever
active and formidable. To name his victories, the towns he took, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
he eſcaped, and the loſſes he ſuffered, would take up more time than I
would chuſe to grant to ſuch accounts, or you ſhould beſtow. Never was
the art of war carried to ſuch a pitch as by him. In this war Europe ſaw,
with aſtoniſhment, campaigns carried on in the midſt of winter; great and
bloody battles fought, yet producing no viſible advantage to the victors. At
no time, ſince the days of heroiſm, were ſuch numbers deſtroyed, ſo
many towns taken, ſo many ſkirmiſhes fought, ſuch ſtratagems
prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, or ſuch intrepidity ſhewn. Armies now were conſidered as
compoſing one ſingle machine, directed by the General, and animated with
one will. From the commentary of theſe campaigns, ſucceeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals will
take their leſſons for devaſtation, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in the arts of
increaſing human calamity.</p>
            <p>England was, all this time, happily retired from the calamities
which drenched the reſt of Europe in blood; yet, from her natural military
eagerneſs, ſeemed deſirous of ſharing thoſe dangers of which ſhe
was only a ſpectator. This paſſion for carrying on a continental war, was
not leſs pleaſing to the Monarch from his native attachments, than to the
people from their natural propenſity to arms. As ſoon as it was known that
Prince Ferdinand had put himſelf at the head of the Hanoverian army, his
Britannic Majeſty, in a ſpeech at the opening of the ſeſſion of
parliament, obſerved, that the late ſucceſſes in Germany had given an
happy turn to his affairs, which it would be neceſſary to improve. The
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons therefore granted liberal ſupplies both for the ſervice of the
King of Pruſſia, and for enabling the army formed in the Electorate of
Hanover, to act vigorouſly in conjunction with him. Soon after it was
conſidered, that men would be a more grateful <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0443100202:249"/> ſupply
than money. The miniſter who had firſt come into power and popularity, by
oppoſing ſuch meaſures, was now prevailed upon to enter into them with
even greater ardour than any of his predeceſſors. The hopes of putting a
ſpeedy end to this war, by vigorous meaſures, his connexions, and, perhaps,
the pleaſure he found in giving his Majeſty pleaſure, incited him eagerly
into a continental war. It is certain, no miniſter could more powerfully
ſecond a warlike Monarch's intentions; that ſpirit of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize which
had, in a meaſure, taken birth with his adminiſtration, he could now direct
at will. The paſſion for military honour ſeemed diffuſed through all
ranks of people; and it only wanted a channel in which to flow. In order to
indulge this general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, the Duke of Marlborough was ſent into
Germany with a ſmall body of Britiſh forces to aſſiſt Prince
Ferdinand, where they behaved with bravery, and conſpired in promoting that
Prince's ſucceſſes. Each victory they gained, however, only ſerved as a
pretext to call over new forces from Britain, while the Engliſh miniſtry
were taught to believe that every laſt battle would be deciſive. The battle
of Crevelt was fought, in which the Hanoverians and Engliſh had the
advantage; but it produced no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The victory of Minden followed; but
laurels ſeemed to be all that England reaped from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered field. After
theſe two victories it was ſuppoſed, that one reinforcement more of
Britiſh forces would terminate the war in our favour; a reinforcement was
therefore ſent. The Britiſh troops in Germany now amounted to above thirty
thouſand men, yet no advantage of any conſequence was the reſult of this
formidable aſſiſtance. War was the trade of ſome Generals, and, it
muſt be allowed, a gainful trade it was. Let me therefore, here again, paſs
over this continued repetition of marchings, ſkirmiſhes, and 
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0443100202:250"/> rencounters, nor load the page with names of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Generals, too difficult to be pronounced by an Engliſh tongue, and equally
grating to a patriot ear. The victories of either ſide might, in fact, be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a compact by which ſomething was to be loſt on either
ſide, and no advantage to be acquired. The Engliſh, at length, began to
open their eyes to their own intereſt; nor could all the ſplendours of
victory ſo far blind them, as not to ſee that they were waging unequal war,
and aſſuming new loads of taxes for conqueſts they could neither
preſerve nor enjoy. Such were the growing diſcontents of the people, when
the King, who had inſpired theſe meaſures, unexpectedly died. On the
twenty-fifth day of October, George II, without any previous diſorder, was
found by his domeſtic ſervants, expiring in his chamber. He had ariſen at
his uſual hour, and obſerved to his attendants, that as the weather was
fine, he would walk out. In a few minutes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, being left alone, he was
heard to fall down upon the floor. The noiſe of his fall brought his
attendants into the room, who lifted him into bed, where he deſired, in a
faint voice, that the Princeſs Amelia might be ſent for; but before her
arrival he expired. George II. died in the 77<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age, and the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
of his reign, in the midſt of victory; and, at that very period, when the
univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal enthuſiaſm of conqueſt began to ſubſide for more ſober
reflexions. If any Monarch was happy in the peculiar mode and time of his
death, it was he. The factions which had been nurſing in his reign, had not
yet come to maturity; and all their virulence threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to fall upon his
ſucceſſor. He was himſelf of no ſhining abilities; and,
conſequently, while he was ſuffered to guide his German dominions, he
entruſted the care of Britain to his miniſters at home. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as we
ſtand too near this Monarch to view his <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0443100202:251"/> real character
without partiality, take the following characters of him, by two writers of
oppoſite ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline"> "As to the extent of his underſtanding (ſays
one) or the ſplendour of his virtue, we rather wiſh for opportunities of
praiſing, than undertake the taſk ourſelves. His public character was
marked with a predilection for his native country, to which he ſacrificed all
other motives."</q>
            </p>
            <p> On the other hand, ſays his panegyriſt, 
<q rend="inline">"On whatever ſide we look upon his character, we
ſhall find ample matter for juſt and unſuſpected praiſe. None of his
predeceſſors in the throne of England lived to ſo great an age, or
enjoyed longer felicity. His ſubjects were ſtill improving under him in
commerce and arts; and his own oeconomy ſet a prudent example to the nation,
which, however, they did not follow. He was, in his temper, ſudden and
violent; but this, though it influenced his behaviour, made no change in his
conduct, which was generally guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon. He was plain and direct in
his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, true to his word, ſteady in his favour and protection to his
ſervants; nor parting even with his miniſters till compelled to it by the
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of faction. In ſhort, through the whole of life he appeared rather
to live for the cultivation of uſeful virtues than ſplendid ones; and,
ſatisfied with being good, left others their unenvied great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</q>

            <head>LETTER XXX.</head>
            <p>I Am ſorry that praiſe beſtowed on living merit is often found
to injure the goodneſs it applauds. The character of the ſucceſſor of
George the ſecond deſerves the warmeſt panegyric; and all who love their
country only wiſh for a continuance of that ſpirit, and that virtue which
has hitherto appeared in him. Never did Monarch come to the throne at a more
critical period; the nation, fluſhed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, yet tired of war;
expecting the loweſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from their humbled enemies, yet
murmuring under the immenſe load of their taxes. One part of the people
acquiring immenſe wealth by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of hoſtilities; another
reduced almoſt to bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy. Beſides this, he ſaw the throne hedged
round by ignorance and faction, men intent only on their own intereſts, and
willing to perſuade Monarchy that whatever conduced to their own wiſhes was
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for the welfare of the kingdom. It was in this diſpoſition of
things, that George III. came to the crown. The kingdom began to divide into
two parties; or, more properly ſpeaking, the very ſame individuals ſeemed
to wear, at once, a face of joy and diſcontent. They felt all the triumphs of
their ſucceſſes, but juſtly dreaded the conſequences of an
expenſive continuance of them. The numberleſs victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they gained by
ſea continued to keep them in ſpirits, and induced them to ſupply the
immenſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the year with chearfulneſs. During the whole period of
the war ſucceeding the execution of Admiral Byng, nothing could be carried on
with more ſpirit and reſolution, than all our naval engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In every
enterprize the ſuperior bravery, ſkill, and dexterity of the Engliſh were
obvious. Often with forces very much diſproportioned, they 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0443100202:253"/> took their adverſaries ſhips, and effectually
diſabled the enemies force by ſea.</p>
            <p>No hiſtory can furniſh examples of ſuch numerous fleets, or
more active commanders. This deſire for victory ſeemed even to diffuſe
itſelf to the loweſt officers; and the captains of privateers ſeemed as
much enamoured of conqueſt as with a deſire of gain. The Admirals, Hawke,
Howe, Boſcawen, Pocock, &amp;c. were always victorious; the Captains, Tyrrel,
Foſter, Gilchriſt, Lockhart, and others, often fought at a diſadvantage,
but never without honour. As an inſtance of the intrepid ſpirit of our
ſeamen in this war, I ſhall mention one action which poſterity, if it
were only ſingly ſupported, might look upon as incredible. The annals of
mankind cannot ſhew an effort of more deſperate courage than was exerted
under the command of captain William Death, commander of the Terrible
privateer. He had, in the beginning of his cruize, made prize of a rich
merchant-ſhip, and with this was returning home to England in triumph, when
he had the misfortune to fall in with the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance privateer of St. Malo,
much his ſuperior in force, he having but twenty-ſix guns, the enemy
thirty-ſix, and a proportionable number of men. The Terrible's prize was
ſoon taken, and converted againſt her; but, though ſo unequally matched,
cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Death maintained a furious engagement that cannot be paralleled in the
annals of any country. The French commander and his ſecond were killed, with
two thirds of his company; but much more dreadful was the ſlaughter on board
the Terrible. When the enemy boarded it, they only found one ſcene of
ſlaughter, ſilence, and deſolation. Of two hundred men only ſixteen
were found remaining, and the ſhip itſelf ſo ſhattered as ſcarcely to
be kept above water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0443100202:254"/> Such were the dear-bought naval victories of
France; and ſuch was the obſtinacy of the Engliſh, even when defeated,
that the court of Verſailles, at length, ſeemed to demand peace at any
rate. To this requeſt the Engliſh were ready to accede, and
Plenipotentiaries were ſent from either court to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociate ſo wiſhed-for
a reconciliation. France ſent to London Mr. Buſſy, a man rather ſkilled
in the arts of negotiation than the open integrity becoming the miniſter of a
great nation. England ſent over, in exchange, Mr. Stanley, to Paris.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed to be a fundamental principle in this treaty, which,
however, proved ineffectual, that each country was to be conſidered as
poſſeſſors of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective conqueſts; and that if any ſuch
were to be given up on one ſide, it was to be only in exchange for ſuch as
had been made by the other. Upon theſe terms it is obvious, that the
Engliſh were likely to be great gainers by a treaty, as they had taken
ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places and dominions from the French, and had loſt only Minorca.
Whether the French had a real deſire to proceed upon ſuch terms is
uncertain; however, they ſoon gave the Engliſh miniſtry ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reaſons to be diſſatisfied with their proceedings. Mr. Pitt, who had for
a long time been ſucceſsful, actuated all the Engliſh meaſures, and
guided their councils, had ever diſdained that pedantry of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
refinement, of which others ſo vainly boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he negociated therefore in
a plain ſimple man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; his guide, ſincerity; and his only object, his
country's good. Several points were agreed upon between each nation, that gave
great hopes that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation might ſpeedily be the reſult. The French
agreed to give up all Canada, a fort upon the river Senegal in Africa, and to
reſtore Minorca. The chief objects in debate were, the privilege they claimed
of continuing to fiſh upon the Banks of Newfoundland, and of having the
damages repaired which they <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0443100202:255"/> ſuſtained by the taking
of their ſhipping before a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of war. Theſe two points were
warmly negotiated on either ſide, not without hopes of ſpeedy adjuſtment,
when, unexpectedly, the whole treaty was, at once, ſet aſide by the
interpoſition of the Spaniſh miniſter, who deſired to have the
intereſts of Spain alſo included in the treaty. Mr. Pitt very juſtly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that as Spain had no part in the war, ſo it was impertinent in
that power to intermeddle in a treaty of peace; and he regarded this
interpoſition in its true light, namely, that of a confederacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
France and Spain mutually to ſupport each other's intereſt. Confident
therefore of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and, perhaps, alſo too much elated by
popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applauſe, he began to treat the French negotiator with a great
ſhare of haughtineſs, of which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to his court at home; and he
was ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called.</p>
            <p>This conduct of Mr. Pitt might have juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred reproach, had
he had no private intimations of a ſecret alliance between France and Spain.
The laſt named power had actually entered into a family compact with France,
by which they engaged to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on a war in conjunction. Of all this the
Engliſh ſecretary had been previouſly apprized, and propoſed in the
privy council to anticipate the deſigns of Spain by an immediate declaration
of war againſt her. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, diſpatch, and reſolution, characterized all
the plans of this miniſter; he found, however, in the privy council men who
were willing to act with more deliberation, and who deſired a certainty of
offence before they demanded a reparation. Spain, they ſaid, has yet given no
certain proofs of their hoſtile inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the Engliſh miniſter at
the court of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid ſtill continues to aſſure us of their pacific
inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe remonſtrances were anſwered by the ſecretary, but
without producing the deſired convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſeeing himſelf therefore
almoſt ſingular in his <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0443100202:256"/> opinion, he was reſolved to
leave an aſſembly wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he knew
himſelf maligned; and he threw up the di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection of meaſures, which, to
uſe his own expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he was no longer allowed to guide. The council
was, at that time, divided between two parties, who were both equally pleaſed
at his reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. One part conſiſted of thoſe who were at the head
of affairs during the preceding reign; the other ſuch as had been taken into
favour in this; neither were diſpleaſed at the removal of a man whoſe
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity threw them into the ſhade, and whoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence controlled
their moderation. But this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular miniſter's being removed, did not
reſtore una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity to the council. The parts which were held together by his
preſence, now diſunited, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention began, which ſtill
continues to ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>The declaration of war with Spain, ſoon after, ſhewed how
well-grounded Mr. Pitt's meaſures were, when he propoſed a former rupture.
However, the union of France and Spain, and the diſunion of our own
miniſtry at home, did not ſeem to retard the progreſs of our arms. The
iſland of Martinico was conquered by Admiral Rodney and General Monck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;
the iſland of St. Lucia ſurrendered ſoon after to Captain Harvey; Granada
was taken by Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier Walſh; and all the neutral iſlands ſubmitted to
the Engliſh dominion. But a bolder blow was ſtruck againſt the Spaniards;
a powerful fleet, and an army of fifteen thouſand men, was ſent againſt
the Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, the key of all their poſſeſſions in South Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. It
made a noble reſiſtance; but in the end was taken. And now the enemies of
Great Britain were humbled on every ſide; the French left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trade or
ſhipping; the ſource of Spaniſh oppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence interrupted; nothing remained
for them, but to aſk for peace, upon ſuch terms as we were pleaſed to
grant. A negociation was accordingly once more begun between the three powers,
by the intervention <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0443100202:257"/> of the King of Sardinia's
Ambaſſador; the Duke of Bedford was ſent over to Paris, and the Duke De
Nivernois came to London; and, at length, the definitive treaty was ſigned at
Paris by the Duke of Bedford, the Duc De Praſlin, and the Marquis De
Grimaldi, and arrived in London February 19, 1763. In order to purchaſe peace
the French gave up all Canada, their right to the neutral iſlands, the fort
of Senegal, and their right of fiſhing on the coaſts of Newfoundland and
the gulph of St. Lawrence, but at a certain diſtance from ſhore. Spain
alſo gave up, on her part, the extenſive country of Florida; ſo that the
Engliſh empire was thus greatly enlarged; and, if we compute its ſtrength
by the quantity of land included in its dominions, it can now boaſt more
power than even the great Roman empire.</p>
            <p>But no country ſhould build upon remote ſtrength; true power
muſt always ſubſiſt at home. When the branches of a large empire become
more powerful than the original ſtem, inſtead of aſſiſting it's
growth, they only overload and exhauſt it nouriſhment. The diſcontents,
therefore, which many have expreſſed at the concluſion of the late peace,
that we did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon harder terms, and increaſe our
poſſeſſions, were ill founded, ſince it is probable we are already
poſſeſſed of more than government can manage. There is ever a certain
extent of empire which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics are able to wield; beyond this her
magnificence is but empty pomp, and her ſize but corpulence.</p>
