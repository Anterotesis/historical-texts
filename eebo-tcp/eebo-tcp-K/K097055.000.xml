            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE Town has been amus'd. with a
Story of late about a Deſign diſcovered
at St. <hi>Germans</hi> to have ſtollen away
the Prince of Wales, and ſome of our
News-Writers have been prevail'd with to put
it into their Publick Papers, and beſtow it upon
the World.</p>
            <p>Since then he that Prints a Story ſubjects both
Himſelf and his Tale to the Cenſure of every
Reader, I have as much Right as another to paſs
my Judgment in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>And tho' I am firſt aſſur'd from very good
Hands, that the Story it ſelf is a Forgery, and
that at St. <hi>Germains</hi> they know nothing of the
Matter; yet I think it may not be amiſs to give
the World ſome ſhort Obſervatious upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
becauſe I believe they will quickly hear more
<pb facs="tcp:0295901700:3"/>
of it. For the Story of Stealing the Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> was not contriv'd to no purpoſe, but as an
Anticedent to ſomething which was to come after,
which the World is to be acquainted with in good
time, when 'tis firſt obſerv'd how they will reliſh
this.</p>
            <p>If what I ſhall ſay be Offenſive to ſuch who
are concern'd for the <hi>Young Gentleman,</hi> they
ought to be angry with the Broachers of the
Story, and not with the Author of theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>

ARGUMENT,
Shewing, That the
Prince of WALES,
Tho' a PROTESTANT, has no
juſt Pretenſions to the
Crown of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>AMONG thoſe People who are
more than ordinarily careful for the
Future, it has been a Queſtion not
a little debated, What ſhall we do
for a King in <hi>England</hi> after the Deceaſe of
his preſent Majeſty and the Princeſs in caſe
they ſhould die without Iſſue?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0295901700:5"/>
And tho' it be properly a Work which no
Body has any thing to do with but a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
yet our buſie Politicians have ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack't
Forreign Countries for a King.</p>
            <p>Some wiſer than others, have propos'd
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Son, the young Prince
of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> Some one, ſome another, as
their Fancies guide them. <hi>Ay,</hi> but ſays a
Learned Rabbi, skill'd in the Letter of the
Law, <hi>he is a Roman Catholick, and that
is a Barr by our Conſtitution. Well,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys
another, <hi>but he may he ſent into</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>to be Educated a Proteſtant.</hi> At the
hearing of which Medium, a Third Party
have thought fit to ſtart a Caſe on the other
ſide; <hi>Why, ſo may ſome body elſe?</hi> and ſo all
Parties become Friends again.</p>
            <q>They that have Ears to hear let them hear.</q>
            <p>Firſt, We thank thoſe Gentlemen for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
the World that they deſpair now
of the Reſtoration of K<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>James,</hi> which
has been ſo long talk'd of, and are content
to Poſtpone their Happineſs to a Time ſo

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0295901700:6"/>
And as to the Caſe in hand, if they
think it proper, they may propoſe it to the
next Parliament, and no doubt but what
they do in it the Nation will be well ſatified
with, and in the mean time we refer them
to the Experiment.</p>
            <p>But it may not be improper to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
here the Project laid to Try the
Nation, How ſuch a Story would take with
them.</p>
            <p>And if you Examine the News-Paper,
you will find it introduc'd into the World
with a <hi>We hear. We hear there has been a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
diſcover'd at St. Germans to ſteal away the
Prince of Wales, and to convey him over into</hi>
England, <hi>to be brought up a Proteſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Writer of this News wou'd be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
helpful in the Diſcovery, if he wou'd
honeſtly inform the World how and where
he heard the News; whether he had it by
Letter, or Meſſenger, Poſt, or Expreſs;
for 'tis certain that no body elſe can hear
any thing of it.</p>
            <p>If he will own <hi>with more honeſty than he
wrote,</hi> that he really invented it of his own
Head, to help fill up his own Paper, as no
queſtion they many times do in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0295901700:7"/>
It will be the beſt Reply to my Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
that any body can make, and I muſt
allow all I am ſaying is as Impertinent as
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Knaviſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he was directed to write it by ſome
body, no matter by who, it muſt be from a
deſign.</p>
            <p>I ſhall attempt therefore to open the Eyes
of the World a little, by Examining the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherences
and Inconſiſtences of the Story,
and then the Deſign of it.</p>
            <p>As to the Incoherence of the Story, a
diſcovery of a Deſign, but by no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or Information, no Perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
taken, nor none enquired after to
be apprehended, no body nam'd to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers,
or diſcovered; ſo that they are
only ſuppoſed to be afraid of ſuch and ſuch
a thing, and to have doubled the Guards
to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Then the Reaſon is ſet down for which
he ſhou'd be convey'd away, to be carried
into <hi>England.</hi> Had they ſtopt there, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might have been meant, ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
might have been ſuppoſed to have
been deſign'd againſt him. But to clear it
up to the World, the very bottom of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0295901700:8"/>
deſign is laid open, that they ſhou'd take
the Child away to Educate him <hi>a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unleſs the Author of this News was let
into the Project I ſpeak of, he wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have ſuggeſted it, but all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind wou'd have thought, that if there
had been any danger of ſtealing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
to carry him into <hi>England,</hi> it ſhou'd
be with ſome wicked deſign to <hi>make away
with him,</hi> his coming being death by our
Law, rather then Educate him in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion.</p>
            <p>The Party therefore that cou'd deſcend
to theſe Particulars, tho' no Evidence be
produc'd, nor no Confeſſion made of any
Perſon concern'd, muſt I ſay be let into the
deſign.</p>
            <p>And now I have ſaid ſo much of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
I deſire to Explain what I mean by
it.</p>
            <p>The deſign I mean, is not to ſteal the
Prince of <hi>Wales, as they call him,</hi> away, and
bring him into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to broach an Oponion among the
People, That on the failure of the preſent
Settlement, the Prince of <hi>VVales</hi> is the true
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0295901700:9"/>
and lawful Heir of the Crown, and that to
qualifie him to Enjoy it, he may be bred a
Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſtant.</p>
            <p>And to inſinuate this more finely into
our Fancies it is put the other way, That
they are afraid the Engliſh People ſhou'd
ſteal him away, to make him a Proteſtant
in order to have the Kingdom, whether he
will or no.</p>
            <p>I cannot help making a little ſport of this
Jeſt—<list>
                  <item>1. That we ſhou'd be made believe the
late King wou'd be ſo chary of this Child
and his Religion, as to prevent his being
declar'd Heir apparent to the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> on the bare apprehenſions of his
being Educated a Proteſtant.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Engliſh ſhou'd be in ſuch
diſtreſs for a Succeſſor to the Crown, when
God be thank'd there are Two happy Lives
to Enjoy it before hand, as to go abroad to
ſteal One.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Crown of <hi>England</hi> ſhou'd be
accounted ſo mean a thing, that a Guard
ſhou'd be ſet upon any body to prevent
their being <hi>ſpirited away</hi> from the Court
of <hi>France</hi> to be made King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0295901700:10"/>
And to add to the ridiculous part of it,
That any body on pretence of Educating
him a Proteſtant, ſhou'd dare to bring him
into <hi>England,</hi> without Licence from the
preſent Government, as is expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for by Act of Parliament. They
wou'd make <hi>a ſpecial Proteſtant</hi> of him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
where he muſt be a Martyr at firſt
Converſion, to bring him where ſetting his
Foot was immediate Death by the Statutes
of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The inſinuation therefore of ſtealing the
Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to make a Proteſtant of
him, is a Figurative Expreſſion, a <hi>Metani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
a way of ſpeaking wherein ſomething
is intended which is not expreſſed, and if I
could make it ſpeak Engliſh, 'tis thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if you pleaſe, Gentlemen, to have the
Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>to Reign over you, after the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
of the preſent Settlement, he is at your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and will come and be brought up in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, whenever you think fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not enter into any Diſcoveries of
the Nature of the Succeſſion of the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> nor of the Right of ſuch Families as
pretend to it, they are things to tender to be
handled here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0295901700:11"/>
But in this caſe I may preſume to ſay, that
ſince the preſent Settlement of the Crown of
<hi>England</hi> is declar'd by the Parliament of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
own'd by the World, and receiv'd by
the general Aſcent of the Nation, at the end
of this Settlement the ſame Collective Body
of the Nation, are the only Judges of the
Right of any Perſon whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And as for the Gentlemen who are ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to reſtore the Line of King <hi>James,</hi> they
are deſir'd to conſider, that by attempting it
in this method, they come under a Neceſſity
of owning the Authority of the Parliament
of <hi>England:</hi> the ſame Authority which Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
his Father, and by conſequence muſt
juſtifie all the Proceedings of the late Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and this will be a bitter Pill to them.</p>
            <p>Not but that ſtranger things than theſe
have been done too for a Crown, but this
muſt be done before an Engliſh Parliament
can ſo much as conſider of it; nay by ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or ſo much as ſuppoſing his Right to be
referr'd to the Engliſh Nation, it muſt at the
ſame time be ſuppos'd that he wou'd not
ſtick at all that to be declar'd capable of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch contradictory and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0295901700:12"/>
things, as makes the Story very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and ſhows the Party is driven to <hi>ſtrange
ſhifts</hi> to bring to paſs their deſigns, and wou'd
comply with any thing to get the Reins in
their hands again.</p>
            <p>Now if they only want to know how the
Nation wou'd reſent an Attempt of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they may be ſoon ſatisfied in that point,
by moving it in Parliament; and in the mean
time they need not pretend to keep a Guard
upon him at St. <hi>Germain,</hi> for I dare ſay the
Engliſh Nation will as ſoon ſteal away his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as him, and they have not ſhown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo fond of either, as to make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not at all enter into the Enquiry
concerning the Legitimacy of his Birth, nor
quote the learned Authorities of the eminent
Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> on that Head, whoſe Evidence is to
as much purpoſe as the matter is inſignificant.</p>
            <p>For be it ſo, that King <hi>James</hi> is the true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Child, it matters not one farthing
in the Title to the Crown; for his Father,
whoſe Legitimacy no body doubts, by being
a Roman Catholick, has rendred himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable

Son, and Settlements are not to be alter'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

time he thinks fit to alter his Religion.</p>
            <p>But methinks it remains as an Eternal
Mark either of the Folly, or Pride of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
that if the Queen was really with
Child (which (<hi>God forgive me if I am mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken</hi>)
I never believed) ſhe did not put it
paſt all poſſibility of Debate, by giving ſuch
undeniable proofs of it, <hi>as 'tis known ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
will admit of,</hi> and that to thoſe Perſons in
particular as ſhe knew wou'd be very ſorry
to ſee it.</p>
            <p>The Queen was not a Lady of ſo much
Nicety, as that ſhe ſhou'd decline letting ſuch
Female Effects of her Conception be known,
<hi>eſpecially to her own Sex,</hi> as wou'd have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
all Gainſayers.</p>
            <p>Nor did ſhe want the Vanity of ſhewing
thoſe invincible Demonſtrations to ſome
Perſons in the Court, to whom ſhe might
have reaſon to think the truth, would have
been a particular Mortification.</p>
            <p>The truth then being ſo eaſie to be made
plain, <hi>and thoſe eaſie ſteps being omitted,</hi> gives
me more cauſe of doubt in the Matter, than
all the Affirmatives of Evidence <hi>Fuller</hi> can do,
for it was not a thing for the Nation to prove
a Negative upon, as ſome have pretended to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0295901700:14"/>
expect, but they in whoſe power it was once
to make it plain, having omitted it, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
ought to doubt the truth of it, becauſe
had it been true, none but Madmen, or worſe,
would have conceal'd any part of it.</p>
            <p>Nor does the Declaration of the preſent
King, when Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſay any more,
than that there was ground to ſuſpect it;
and then concludes, <hi>that the Examination both
of it, and the Right of Succeſſion, is referr'd to
a free Parliament.</hi> Which Parliament having
ſettled the Succeſſion, according to that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
on the unexpected Occaſion of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of King <hi>James,</hi> and his carrying this
Son on whom the doubt was rais'd into
<hi>France,</hi> to be brought up a Papiſt, <hi>Examining
into his Birth became needleſs;</hi> and it ſignifies
nothing whether he be Legitimate, or no;
his Father rendred them both incapable, by
the Article of Religion, and the Nation has
ſettled the Succeſſion another way.</p>
            <p>This, with ſubmiſſion, I think to be the
true ſtate of the Caſe, and will paſs for ſuch
with me, till I ſee it ſtated otherwiſe by ſome
body that underſtands it better than I do.</p>
            <p>But ſome have ſtarted a Caſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a word or two of Reply.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0295901700:15"/>
               <hi>If the Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>be allowed to be the
Legitimate Son of King</hi> James, <hi>and had been a
Proteſtant, there had been no Objection against
his Title.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This has a plain Anſwer in the ſequel of
the Story. The Abdication of King <hi>James</hi>
did not conſiſt in his Male-adminiſtration,
<hi>but in his deſerting the Nation;</hi> and it may be
remembred that there was great ſtrugling
for the Word in the <hi>Convention,</hi> ſome
wou'd have had the word <hi>Deſerted</hi> voted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Abdicated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if King <hi>James</hi> Deſerted the Nation,
ſo did his Son with him, and thereby the
Throne became vacant, and the power of
Government devolv'd upon ſuch as were
next Heirs; and who they were was to be
decided by the Parliament, who have been
allow'd to be the Judges of the Right of
Succeſſion in all Ages.</p>
            <p>Now the Parliament did not upon this
Vacancy of the Throne proceed to Elect a
King, <hi>as ſome People are mighty fond of ſaying,</hi>
and ſo alter our Conſtitution to an Elective
Monarchy.</p>
            <p>But they proceeded to Examine whoſe
the Right of Government was, and to make
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0295901700:16"/>
a Declaration of that Right by Authority of
Parliament, and King <hi>James</hi> and his Son,
<hi>if he be his Son,</hi> having left the Kingdom,
they declared that the Throne was thereby
vacant, that is, by their deferting the People,
and that the Succeſſion ought to deſcend ſo
and ſo; which Succeſſion they farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the Sanction of an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Had K. <hi>James</hi> notwithſtanding his Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adminiſtration,
continued in the Kingdom,
tho' he might have been Depoſed, yet the
Parliament muſt have gone upon other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
to have transferr'd the Succeſſion to
the Crown from him to another Head.</p>
            <p>On this account it is that the King and
Queen of <hi>England</hi> are declared rightful and
lawful.</p>
            <p>And on this Foundation the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
we ſpeak of, tho' he were the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Son of King <hi>James,</hi> and a Proteſtant,
yet having deſerted the People of <hi>England</hi>
with his Father, has equally abdicated the
Government, and the Throne was thereby
vacant.</p>
            <p>The Point of Religion is the next Barr;
the Commons of <hi>England</hi> at the firſt Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0295901700:17"/>
of the Convention, did not make any
new Laws, but only made a Declaration of
what was before the undoubted Right of the
People of <hi>England,</hi> and what ought to be
obſerv'd by any Prince who ſhou'd hereafter
ſucceed in the Government, and in order to
obviate all Objections <hi>againſt</hi> the continuing
under the Government of King <hi>James,</hi> and
before they had entred upon ths Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or his having gone away and left them,
they laid a firm Foundation of a Regular
Government, in a Meſſage to the Lords,
carried up by Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> and a Body of
their Members, in which the Vote of the
Houſe was read at the Barr of the Houſe of
Lords, thus:</p>
            <p>Reſolved <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi>
               <q>That it is inconſiſtent with the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Proteſtant Kingdom, to be
governed by a Popiſh Prince.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now how a Popiſh Prince may pretend to
be converted and turn Proteſtant, to obtain a
Crown, and how often he may turn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
on the ſame account, and whether the
Settlement of the Succeſſion is oblig'd to
change with him; or how far a Parliament
wou'd think themſelves oblig'd to take notice
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0295901700:18"/>
of ſuch changes of the Religion of a Prince,
theſe are things not for me to determine.</p>
            <p>But this I dare be free to determine, that
no Parliament will ſend into <hi>France</hi> to ſteal
away a Prince to make a Proteſtant of, and
ſo force him to accept of the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
whether he will or no, and eſpecially a
Perſon whom they thought fit to leave whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of their Settlement before.</p>
            <p>So that theſe Gentlemen may ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the labour of attempting the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of this Prince, for the Settlement of our
Succeſſion was not built upon his being a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick, but upon the Abdication of
his Father, and ſo far upon his own, as his
Birth ſhall appear to give him a Title; ſince
he has from that time forward abſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the Kingdom to which his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>if he had any,</hi> were to be made.</p>
            <p>It may be ask'd here, To what end and
purpoſe K. <hi>James</hi> convey'd him away, if he
had any confidence in the poſſibility of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the point of his Legitimacy, he might
have left him here, it was impracticable, that
any violence cou'd have been pretended to be
acted upon him, for nothing cou'd have been
charg'd upon him, if the Illegitimacy of his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0295901700:19"/>
Birth had been alledg'd, the proof wou'd have
been put upon the Nations ſide, till which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
cou'd legally have been done to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
but as it is, the proof remains at their
own doors, which ſince they thought fit to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
I ſee no concern the Nation has in the
matter.</p>
            <p>For, ſuppoſe Q. <hi>Mary</hi> had really been with
Child, and had, <hi>for as wiſe ends as other things
were then done,</hi> thought fit never to let it be
known, and a Child had been born in the
dark, and bred up in private, and the Nation
knew nothing of the matter, but that twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years after, when the Parliament might
have ſettled the Succeſſion another way, this
Child ſhou'd be Trumpt up as a right Heir
to the Crown.</p>
            <p>It wou'd be never the leſs true that he was
K. <hi>James</hi>'s Son, and he wou'd have as much
right to the Crown as a real Son; but who
wou'd have believ'd it; wou'd not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſay, and reaſon good, <hi>Why, was it not
told us that the Queen was with Child? Why,
was not ſome of the Royal Family entruſted with
the knowledge of it? Why was not the
Queen's being with Child made known, and
the Proteſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Ladies of the Court ſhown</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0295901700:20"/>
               <hi>ſuch proofs of it as that they might be able to
teſtifie the truth of it</hi>—wou'd it be enough
to ſay it was below the Queen to trouble her
head about it, and ſhe did not think the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Nation worth her while.</p>
            <p>I queſtion whether any Nation in <hi>Europe</hi>
wou'd accept of a King upon ſuch terms; we
ſee 'tis quite otherwiſe in <hi>France,</hi> where all the
Princes of the Blood are at liberty, and claim
it as a priviledge to come into the very
Chamber of the Queen when ſhe is in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
and to ſee the Infant as ſoon as 'tis come
into the World.</p>
            <p>The Caſe thus ſtated, I put it upon all the
Champions of their Party to diſprove the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
which I lay down in theſe few words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Perſons on whom the proof of his
Legitimacy lay, having omitted the Legal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of it, which they ought to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
'tis very reaſonable that we ſhou'd queſtion
the truth of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And while the Ligitimacy of his Birth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
a queſtion, the People of <hi>England</hi> ought
not to trouble their heads about him, for 'tis
not for us to enquire of it, but they ſhou'd
have made it out whoſe buſineſs it was.</p>
            <p>Thus far the reaſon of the Caſe is plain,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0295901700:21"/>
without any need to go to proving of Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>And while it is thus, they may even take
their double Guards off of him again, for if
he is ever Kidnap'd away to make a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of, we muſt be reduc'd to very hard
terms, and the Engliſh Crown go a begging
at a moſt pitiful rate.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I am no Friend to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
Government in <hi>England</hi> when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on the laſt, how ill it was manag'd, and
how ſoon it fell into Diſorders and Parties,
and how little a while it continu'd; but I had
rather ſee a Commonwealth ſet up, or any
thing (Popery excepted) than that we ſhou'd
be brought to ſeek a King at the French
Court, and one that we have repudiated as
born in hugger-mugger, no body knows how,
nor where, and that his Mother did not
think it worth while to give the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſatisfaction about when ſhe was with
Child, but on the contrary, ſcorn'd the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of ſome of the firſt Quality to make
the Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>But that which adds to the Banter too, is
that we ſhou'd ſteal him away. <hi>Bleſs us all!</hi>
that we ſhou'd turn <hi>Kidnappers</hi> for a King,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0295901700:22"/>
and ſpirit folks Children away, <hi>for let him be
whoſe Son he will, 'tis certain he is ſome bodies,</hi> to
make Kings of them.</p>
            <p>The truth on't is, it is not a light matter
to be a King of <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis a Poſt of great
Difficulty as well as Honour, and perhaps K.
<hi>James</hi> may be afraid to venture his Son, leaſt
he ſhou'd have no better ſucceſs than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
which wou'd certaily fall out if he took
his Meaſures.</p>
            <p>But to think that the Engliſh Nation ſhou'd
ever entertain ſuch thoughts of his Son, <hi>allow he
were ſo,</hi> as to take him away by ſtealth. I cannot
call it an affront to the Nation, 'tis rather a
Banter upon the poor young Gentleman, who
I dare ſay knows not a word of the matter.</p>
            <p>I remember I have heard it ſaid before the
Fire of <hi>London</hi> happen'd, news was carried
down into the Country that the City was
burnt, and was reported publickly above 100
Miles from <hi>London,</hi> at leaſt two days before
the Fire began, which was a certain Token
of a deſign to bring it to paſs.</p>
            <p>If I ſhou'd judge of the preſent Caſe by the
practice of thoſe People, I ſhou'd expect to
hear next Poſt that this young Prince is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
loſt, carried away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0295901700:23"/>
Grief of his Parents, and the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the whole Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not venture to ſay it will be ſo, but
I may venture to ſay there are ſeveral Turns
of State in the World which ſuch a Thing
may anſwer.</p>
            <p>As firſt, If it ſhou'd be true that at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the buſineſs, this was not the Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Son of K. <hi>James,</hi> which however uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
we are of it, it is well enough known to
themſelves—Why now they ſee the Sham
won't take, and they have ran the Jeſt ſo far
as that they have ruin'd themſelves, and the
Show is over, they will of courſe be ſoon wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Child, and as a Plot made a Prince
of him, ſo another may reduce him to what
they pleaſe; he may be loſt in the dark, and
be heard of no more, and give it out, that the
Engliſh have carry'd him away to reſerve him
in <hi>Petto,</hi> as the Pope does his Cardinals, to
make a King of him when they want one, and
in the mean time bring him up a Heretick.</p>
            <p>This is an eaſy way to be rid of him when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they pleaſe, and ſo the poor young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
had better have appear'd in the world
what he really was—nor do we want Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Impoſtors ſet up in the World to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0295901700:24"/>
Princes who have afterwards vaniſh'd
as they came when the Perſons who ſet them
up cou'd not bring to paſs their deſigns by it.</p>
            <p>Or if we ſhou'd ſuppoſe that the King of
<hi>France</hi> has his Eyes on the Succeſſion of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(as he has lately had on that of <hi>Spain</hi>)
in right of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
may oblige King <hi>James</hi> to make the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Experiment of leaving him the Crown
by his laſt Will and Teſtament, I do not ſay
ſuch Chimera's as theſe are in the heads of
any body, but I do ſay that if they are, 'twill
be abſolutely neceſſary to remove the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
we are ſpeaking of out of the way.</p>
            <p>And what likelier Project can they have
to rid themſelves of him, and as they may
think, at the ſame time to make the Nation
uneaſy, then to give out that the Engliſh have
carried him away to make a Proteſtant of
him.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Ends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, that ſuch a thing will
ſerve, and I may be excuſed making ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Gueſſes and Suppoſitions, for none of
them are ſo wild and chimerical, as the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of bringing him hither.</p>
            <p>And if any ſuch Meaſures ſhou'd be taken
with the young Gentlemen, I think a ſingle
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0295901700:25"/>
Author may venture to enter this Proteſt in
the Name of the whole Nation, that 'tis a
Trick of their own, and the Engliſh Nation
can have no hand in it.</p>
            <p>The Authority of the Nation cannot have
any hand in it, becauſe they can do nothing
in private, and it muſt be known if it had
been Parliamentary.</p>
            <p>The honeſt proteſtant loyal Party cannot
be ſaid to have a hand in it, becauſe Mankind
is ſaid not to be able to do that which their
known Intereſt forbids them to do, and no
body can imagine that Party ſhould ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to bring him hither, without imagining
at the ſame time that it was to Murther and
Deſtroy him, which God forbid.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Engliſh Party, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deſign it, becauſe 'twill not any way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
their deſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If ever they ſhou'd have power to
make him a King publickly, 'tis plain he will
serve their turn as well if he be a Papiſt as a
Proteſtant, or elſe they cannot be what we call
them, <hi>Jacobites,</hi> that is, Friends to King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If they bring him in only to reſerve
him in <hi>Petto,</hi> as I ſaid, it muſt be one of theſe
two ways, either publickly or privately.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0295901700:26"/>
If publickly, unleſs they have a Force to
defend him, they bring him only to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for our Laws will take immediate hold
on him, and put him to death.</p>
            <p>If privately, to be reſerv'd till the Line ſhall
fail, he muſt then reſide <hi>Incognito,</hi> and if ever
the time ſhou'd come to ſet him up, having
been loſt ſo many years, no body wou'd know
him, and the Nation wou'd never believe
'twas he, which wou'd always leave room
for Impoſtors, and ſetting up ſham Princes to
miſe Inſurrections, and diſturb the publick
<hi>Peace</hi> of the Nation, as in the Caſe of <hi>Perkin
Warbeck</hi> and <hi>Ralph Wilford</hi> in the days' of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
            <p>So that rightly examin'd, this Sham will
never faſten upon the Engliſh Nation, for it
will anſwer the Ends of neither Friend nor
Foe.</p>
            <p>But if ever we hear that the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Wales,</hi> as they call him, is loſt, carried away,
it muſt either be that <hi>they</hi> are conſcious to
themſelves of his being a foſter Son, and the
deſign having miſcarried, are weary of the
Adopt, and ſo have diſmiſt him this World;
or elſe that he is remov'd to try another
Fetch for the Engliſh Crown by way of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0295901700:27"/>
which, if the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Piedmont</hi> dies, falls
by Inheritance, the Barr of Religion excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> in right of the
Wife of the preſent Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
who is Grand-daughter to a Daughter of
<hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt.</p>
            <p>And as to the Barr of Religion, pray what's
that to a good Army; What's the Goſpel to
a Kettle Drum? or Juſtice and Laws to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Curiaſſeeres? If the French King
comes once to have a fair Claim to the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> for his Grandſon, and you have
nothing to plead in Barr but his Religion,
he'll talk with you about that in other
Terms—</p>
            <p>You muſt certainly expect to talk in the
Inſernal Language of Fire and Smoke, and
tho' tis hoped we ſhov'd have Zeal enough
for our Religion, to fight him to the laſt
Gaſp, yet all Men muſt allow the <hi>Power</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> at this time is ſo great, that 'twould
be much better never to have it brought to
a Trial.</p>
