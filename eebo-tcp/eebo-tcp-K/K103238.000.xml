            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS the experiment of determining the univerſal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of matter, which you lately conducted with ſo much accuracy and ſucceſs, is of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and curioſity, that it may probably be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after repeated by the learned in other countries, and in other ſituations; and as the utmoſt preciſion is deſirable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0992600400:4"/>in ſo nice an experiment; I have compoſed the incloſed paper to determine the beſt part of a hill for making the obſervations, ſo as to obtain the greateſt quantity of attraction.</p>
            <p>I have no doubt, Sir, that the determination of this point will appear of ſome conſequence in the opinion of one who has the improvement of uſeful knowledge ſo much at heart; and if the manner in which it is here made, meet your approbation, I ſhall deſire the favour of your preſenting it to the Royal Society.</p>

            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0992600400:5"/>
            <p n="1">1. The great ſucceſs of the experiment, lately made by the Royal Society, on the hill Schehallien, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the univerſal attraction of matter, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conſequences that have reſulted from it, may probably give occaſion to other experiments of the ſame kind to be made elſewhere: and as all poſſible means of accuracy and facility are to be deſired in ſo delicate and laborious an undertaking; it has occurred to me that it might not be unuſeful to add, by way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to my paper of calculations relative to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned experiment, an inveſtigation of the height above the bottom of a hill, at which its horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal attraction ſhall be the greateſt; ſince that is the height at which commonly the obſervations ought to be made, and ſince this beſt point of obſervation has never been any where determined that I know of, but has been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſpoken of or gueſſed at, it being ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted at ⅓, and ſometimes at ½ of the height of the hill; whereas from theſe inveſtigations it is found to be generally at about only ¼ of the altitude from the bottom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let ABCEDA be part of a cuneus of matter, its ſides or faces being the two ſimilar right-angled trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles ABC, ADE meeting in the point A, and forming the indefinitely ſmall angle BAD. Then of any ſection
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0992600400:6"/>bced, perpendicular to the planes ABD and ADE, the attraction on a body at A in the direction AB, is equal to the conſtant quantity s<hi>s;</hi> where s = ſin. <g ref="char:morethan">›</g>BAC and <hi>s</hi> = ſin. <g ref="char:morethan">›</g>BAD, to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius 1.</p>

To apply now theſe premiſes to the finding of the place where the attraction of a hill is greateſt, it will be neceſſary to ſuppoſe the hill to have ſome certain fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. That poſition is moſt convenient for obſerving the attraction, in which the hill is moſt extended in the eaſt and weſt direction. Suppoſing then ſuch a poſition of a hill, and that it is alſo of a uniform height and meridional ſection throughout; the point of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt evidently be equally diſtant from the two ends. But inſtead of being only conſiderably extended, I ſhall ſuppoſe the hill to be indefinitely extended to the eaſt and to the weſt of the point of obſervation, in order that the inveſtigation may be mathematically true, and yet at the ſame time ſufficiently exact for the before-ſaid limited extent alſo. It will alſo come neareſt to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0992600400:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>practical experiment, to ſuppoſe the hill to be a long triangular priſm, ſo that all its meridional ſections may be ſimilar triangles. Let therefore the triangle ABC re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent its ſection by a verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal plane paſſing through the meridian, or one ſide of an indefinitely thin cuneus whoſe edge is in PG; or rather PBCGP the ſide of one cuneus, and PAG the ſide of another, their common edge being the line PG perpendicular to the baſe AC; P being the required point in the ſide AB where the attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſection ABC, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> indefinitely thin cuneus, ſhall be greateſt in a direction parallel to the horizon AC. And then from the foregoing ſuppoſitions, it is evident that in whatever point of AB the attraction of ABC is greateſt, there alſo will the attraction of the whole hill be the greateſt.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0992600400:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>Which ſhews that the other limit is 29/100; that is, when the hill is extremely low, the point of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt attraction is at 29/100 of the altitude, like as it is at 25/100 when the hill is very ſteep. And between theſe limits it is always found, it being nearer to the one or the other of them, as the hill is flatter or ſteeper.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Thus then we find that at ¼ of the altitude, or very little more, is the beſt place for obſervation, to have the greateſt attraction from a hill in the form of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular priſm of an indefinite length. But when its length is limited, the point of greateſt attraction will deſcend a little lower; and the ſhorter the hill is, the lower will that point deſcend. For the ſame reaſon, all pyramidal hills have their place of greateſt attraction a little below that above determined. But if the hill have a conſiderable ſpace flat at the top, after the manner of a fruſtum, then the ſaid point will be a little higher than as above found. Commonly, however, ¼ of the altitude may be uſed for the beſt place of obſervation, as the point of greateſt attraction will ſeldom differ ſenſibly from that place. And when uncommon circumſtances may produce a difference too great to be intirely neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the obſerver muſt exerciſe his judgment in gueſſing at the neceſſary change he ought to make in the place of obſervation, ſo as to obtain the beſt effect which the concomitant circumſtances will admit of.</p>
