            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAVING, for ſome years, met with very great ſucceſs in my productions of the muſical kind; when I wrote the following Opera, it was with unuſual care and attention; and it was the general opinion of my friends, ſome of whom rank among the beſt judges, that of all my trifles, Lionel and Clariſſa was the moſt pardonable; a deciſion in its favour which I was the prouder of, becauſe, to the beſt of my knowledge, through the whole, I had not borrowed an expreſſion, a ſentiment, or a character, from any dramatic writer extant.</p>
            <p>When Mr. GARRICK thought of performing this piece at Drury-lane Theatre, he had a new ſinger to bring out, and every thing poſſible for her advantage was to be done; this neceſſarily occaſioned ſome new ſongs and airs to be introduced; and other ſingers, with voices of a different compaſs from thoſe who originally acted the parts, occaſioned ſtill more; by which means the greateſt part of the muſic unavoidably became new. This is the chief, and indeed the only alteration made in the Opera; and even to that, I ſhould in many places have been forced, much againſt my will, had it not given a freſh opportunity to Mr. Dibdin to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play his admirable talents as a muſical compoſer. And I will be bold to ſay, that his airs, ſerious and comic, in this Opera, will appear to no diſadvantage by being heard with thoſe of ſome of the greateſt maſters.</p>

                  <p>Well, but liſten to me, papa—When you go out with your gun, do you take any pleaſure in ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor tame ducks, and chickens in your yard? No; the partridge, the pheaſant, the woodcock are the game! there is ſome ſport in bringing them down, becauſe they are wild; and it is juſt the ſame with an huſband or a lover. I would not waſte powder and ſhot to wound one of your ſober pretty behaved gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; but to hit a libertine, extravagant, madcap fellow, to take him upon the wing—</p>

                  <p>Well, but, good colonel, what do you ſay to my worthy and honourable patron here, Sir John Flowerdale?

                  <p>His father was a general officer, a particular friend of Sir John's, who, like many more brave men, that live and die in defending their country, left little elſe than honour behind him. Sir John ſent this young man, at his own expence, to Oxford; where, while, his ſon lived, they were upon the ſame footing: And ſince our young gentleman's death, which you know unfortunately happened about two years ago, he has continued him there. During the vacation, he is come to pay us a viſit; and Sir John intends that he ſhall ſhortly take orders, for a very conſiderable benefice in the gift of the family, the preſent incumbent of which is an aged man.</p>

I quarrelled with his Lordſhip about ſix years before his death, and ſo had not an opportunity of ſeeing how the youth went on; if I had, Mr. Jenkins, I would no more have ſuffered him to be made ſuch a monkey of—He has been in my houſe but three days, and it is all turned topſy-turvy by him and his raſcally ſervants—then his chamber is like a perfumer's ſhop with waſh-balls, paſtes, and pomatum—and do you know he had the impudence to tell me yeſterday at my own table, that I did not know how to behave myſelf?</p>

                  <p>Heigho! don't be ſurpriſed, child; it was the ſame thing with my late dear brother, Lord Jeſſamy; they never could agree: that good natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, friendly ſoul, knowing the delicacy of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, has often ſaid, Siſter Mary, I pity you. Not but your papa has good qualities, and I aſſure you I remember him a very fine gentleman himſelf. In the year of the hard froſt, one thouſand ſeven hundred and thirty-nine, when he firſt paid his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to me, he was called agreeable Jack Oldboy, though I married him without the conſent of your noble grandfather.</p>

                  <p>Dear Sir, your goodneſs to me of every kind is ſo great, ſo unmerited! Your condeſcenſion, your friendly attentions—in ſhort, Sir, I want words to expreſs my ſenſe of obligations—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Fie, fie! no more of them. By my laſt letters, I find that my old friend the Rector, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in good health, conſidering his advanced years. You may imagine I am far from deſiring the death of ſo worthy and pious a man; yet I muſt own, at this time, I could wiſh you were in orders, as you might then perform the ceremony of my daughter's marriage; which would give me a ſecret ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <p>Why, really, Lionel, from the character of her intended huſband, I have no room to doubt, but this match will make Clariſſa perfectly happy: to be ſure, the alliance is the moſt eligible for both families.</p>

                  <p>The fondneſs of a father is always ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of partiality; yet, I believe, I may venture to ſay, that few young women will be found more unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable than my daughter: her perſon is agreeable, her temper ſweet, her underſtanding good; and, with the obligations ſhe has to your inſtruction—</p>

                  <p>You do my endeavours too much honour, Sir; I have been able to add nothing to Miſs Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale's accompliſhments, but a little knowledge in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſmall importance to a mind already ſo well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>

                  <p>I don't think ſo; a little knowledge, even in thoſe matters, is neceſſary for a woman, in whom I am far from conſidering ignorance as a deſireable

               <stage>Changes to a View of Sir <hi>JOHN FLOWERDALE</hi>'s Houſe, with Gates, and a Proſpect of the Garden. <hi>HARMAN</hi> enters with Colonel <hi>OLDBOY.</hi>

                  <p>Well, and how does my old friend Dick Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum? I have not ſeen him theſe twelve years: he was an honeſt worthy fellow as ever breathed; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he kept a girl in London, and was curſedly plagued by his wife's relations.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir Richard was always a man of ſpirit, Colonel.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>But as to this buſineſs of yours, which he tells me of in his letter—I don't ſee much in it.—An affair with a citizen's daughter—pinked her brother in a duel—Is the fellow likely to die?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, we hope not; but as the matter is dubious, and will probably make ſome noiſe, I thought it was better to be for a little time out of the way; when hearing my caſe, Sir Richard Rantum mentioned you; he ſaid, he was ſure you would permit me to remain at your houſe for a few days, and offered me a recommendation.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>And there's likely to be a brat in the caſe—And the girl's friends are in buſineſs—I'll tell you what will be the conſequence then—They will be for going to law with you for a maintenance—but no matter, I'll take the affair in hand for you—make me your ſolicitor; and if you are obliged to pay for a ſingle ſpoonful of pap, I'll be content to father all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Foundling Hoſpital.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>I'm ſure, Sir, you are very kind.</p>

                  <p>But hold—hark you—you ſay there's money to be had—ſuppoſe you were to marry the wench?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you think, Sir, that would be ſo right, after what has happened? Beſides, there's a ſtronger
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0374500100:27"/>
objection—To tell you the truth, I am honourably in love in another place.</p>

                  <p>Yes, Sir, but there are obſtacles—A father—In ſhort, Sir, the miſtreſs of my heart lives in this very county, which makes even my preſent ſituation a little irkſome.</p>

                  <p>But look who comes yonder—Ha! ha! ha! My ſon picking his ſteps like a dancing-maſter. Pr'ythee, Harman, go into the houſe, and let my wife and daughter know we are come, while I go and have ſome ſport with him: they will introduce you to Sir John Flowerdale.</p>

Don't you think they'll wonder at your getting up ſo ſoon after dinner, and before any of the reſt of the company?</p>

                  <speaker>Lion.</speaker>
                  <p>For Heaven's ſake, Jenny, don't ſpeak to me: I neither know where I am, nor what I am doing; I am the moſt wretched and miſerable of all mankind.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>
                  <p>Poor dear ſoul, I pity you. Yes, yes, I believe you are miſerable enough indeed; and I aſſure you, I have pitied you a great while, and ſpoke many a word in your favour; when you little thought you had ſuch a friend in a corner.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>But, good Jenny, ſince by ſome accident or other, you have been able to diſcover what I would willingly hide from all the world; I conjure you, as you regard my intereſt, as you value your Lady's peace and honour, never let the moſt diſtant hint of it eſcape you; for it is a ſecret of that importance—</p>

                  <speaker>Jen.</speaker>
                  <p>And, perhaps, you think I can't keep a ſecret. Ah! Mr. Lionel, it muſt be hear, ſee, and ſay nothing in this world, or one has no buſineſs to live in it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides who would not be in love with my Lady? There's never a man this day alive but might be proud of it; for ſhe is the handſomeſt, ſweeteſt temperdeſt! And I am ſure one of the beſt miſtreſſes ever poor girl had.</p>

                  <p>And ſo ſhe is indeed—Do you know that ſhe gave me her blue and ſilver ſack to-day, and it is every crum as good as new; and, go things as they will, don't you be fretting and vexing yourſelf, for I am mortally ſartain ſhe would liverer ſee a toad than this Jeſſamy. Though I muſt ſay, to my thinking, he's a very likely man; and a finer pair of eye-brows, and a more delicater noſe I never ſaw on a face.</p>

                  <p>What you tell me, Jenny, is a thing I neither merit or expect: No, I am unhappy; and let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo: my moſt preſumptuous thoughts ſhall never carry me to a wiſh that may affect her quiet, or give her cauſe to repent.</p>

                  <p>That's very honourable of you, I muſt needs ſay; but for all that, liking's liking, and one can't help it; and if it ſhould be my Lady's caſe, it is no fault of yours. I am ſure, when ſhe called me into her dreſſing-room, before ſhe went down to dinner, there ſhe ſtood with her eyes brim full of tears; and ſo I fell a-crying for company—and then ſhe ſaid, ſhe could not abide the chap in the parlour; and at the ſame time, ſhe bid me take an opportunity to ſpeak to you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you wou'd meet her in the garden this evening after tea; for ſhe has ſomething to ſay to you.</p>

                  <p>Jenny, I ſee you are my friend: for which I thank you, though I know it is impoſſible to do me any ſervice; take this ring, and wear it for my ſake.</p>

                  <p>I am very much obliged to your honour; I am your friend indeed—but, I ſay, you won't forget to be in the garden now; and in the mean time keep as little in the houſe as you can, for walls have eyes and ears; and I can tell you, the ſervants take notice of your uneaſineſs, tho' I am always deſiring them to mind their buſineſs.</p>

                  <p>Pſha! have a care yourſelf; it is you that breeds ſuſpicion, ſighing and pining about; you look for all the world like a ghoſt; and if you don't pluck up your ſpirits, you will be a ghoſt ſoon; letting things get the better of you. Though to be ſure, when I thinks with myſelf, being croſs'd in love is a terrible thing—There was a young man in the town where I was born made away with himſelf upon account of it.</p>

                  <p>Now, for my part, papa, I doubt it very much; though, by what I heard the gentleman ſay juſt now within, I find he imagines the Lady has a violent partiality for him; and yet he may be miſtaken there too.</p>

                  <p>For ſhame, Dy! what the miſchief do you mean? How can you talk ſo tartly to a poor young fellow under misfortunes? Give him your hand, and aſk his pardon. Don't mind her, Harman.—For all this, ſhe is as good-natur'd a little devil, as ever was born.</p>

                  <p>You may remember, Sir, I told you before dinner, that I had for ſome time carried on a private correſpondence with my lovely girl; and that her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe conſent we deſpair of obtaining, is the great obſtacle to our happineſs.</p>

                  <p>Why don't you carry her off in ſpight of him, then?—I ran away with my wife—aſk my Lady Mary, ſhe'll tell you the thing herſelf.—Her old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited

Lord of a father thought I was not good enough; but I mounted a garden-wall, notwithſtanding their cheveux-de-frize of broken glaſs bottles, took her out of a three pair of ſtairs window, and brought her down a ladder in my arms.—By the way, ſhe would have ſqueezed through a cat-hole to get at me.—And I would have taken her out of the Tower of London, damme, if it had been ſurrounded with the three regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of guards.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>But ſurely, papa, you would not perſuade the gentleman to ſuch a proceeding as this is; conſider the noiſe it will make in the country; and, if you are known to be the adviſer and abettor—</p>

                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Ma'am; that I have ſpirit enough to take her, if ſhe is willing to go; and thus far I dare venture to promiſe, that between this and to-morrow morning, I will find out whether ſhe is or not.</p>

                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Serious! damme, if I an't. I have put twenty young fellows in a way of getting girls that they never would have thought of: and bring her to my houſe; whenever you come, you ſhall have a ſupper and a bed; but you muſt marry her firſt, becauſe my Lady will be ſqueamiſh.</p>

I have let his daughter go; but, I think, I was in the wong; for a woman that inſults me, is no more ſafe than a man.

                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>So then, the myſtery is diſcovered:—but is it poſſible that my daughter's refuſal of Colonel Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy's ſon ſhould procced from a clandeſtine engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that engagement with Lionel?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenk.</speaker>
                  <p>My niece, Sir, is in her young Lady's ſecrets, and Lord knows ſhe had little deſign to betray them; but having remarked ſome odd expreſſions of her's yeſterday, when ſhe came down to me this morning with the letter, I queſtioned her; and, in ſhort, drew the whole affair out; upon which I feigned a recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome buſineſs with you, and deſired her to carry the letter to Colonel Oldboy's herſelf, while I came up hither.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>And they are mutually promiſed to each other, and that promiſe was exchanged yeſterday?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenk.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, and it is my duty to tell you; elſe I would rather die than be the means of wounding the heart of my dear young lady: for if there is one upon earth of truly noble and delicate ſentiments—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought ſo once, Jenkins.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenk.</speaker>
                  <p>And think ſo ſtill: O good Sir John, now is the time for you to exert that character of worth and gentleneſs which the world ſo deſervedly has given you. You have indeed cauſe to be offended; but conſider, Sir, your daughter is young, beautiful, and amiable; the poor youth unexperienced, ſenſible, and at a time of life when ſuch temptations are hard to be reſiſted; their opportunities were many, their caſt of thinking the ſame.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>Jenkins, I can allow for all theſe things; but the young hypocrites—There's the thing, Jenkins; their hypocriſy, their hypocriſy wounds me.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>Then what opportunity have they had? They never were together but when my ſiſter or myſelf made one of the company; beſides, I had ſo firm a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on Lionel's honour and gratitude—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenk.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I can never think that Nature ſtamp'd that gracious countenance of his, to maſk a corrupt heart.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>How! at the very time that he was conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of being himſelf the cauſe of it, did he not ſhew more concern at this affair than I did? Nay, don't I tell you that laſt night, of his own accord, he offered to be a mediator in the affair, and deſired my leave to ſpeak to my daughter? I thought myſelf obliged to him, conſented; and in conſequence of his aſſurance of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, wrote that letter to Colonel Oldboy, to deſire the family would come here again to-day.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenk.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, as we were ſtanding in the next room, I heard a meſſage delivered from Mr. Lionel, deſiring leave to wait upon your daughter; I dare ſwear they will be here preſently; ſuppoſe we were to ſtep into that cloſet, and overhear their converſation?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>What, Jenkins, after having lived ſo many years in confidence with my child, ſhall I become an eves-dropper to detect her?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenk.</speaker>
                  <p>It is neceſſary at preſent.—Come in, my dear maſter, let us only conſider that we were once young like them; ſubject to the ſame paſſions, the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretions; and it is the duty of every man to pardon errors incident to his kind.</p>

                  <p>O Madam! I have betray'd you. I have gone and ſaid ſomething I ſhould not have ſaid to my uncle Jenkins; and, as ſure as day, he has gone and told it all to Sir John.</p>

                  <p>As for you, Clariſſa, ſince your earlieſt infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, you have known no parent but me; I have been to you, at once, both father and mother; and, that I might the better fulfill thoſe united duties, tho' left a widower in the prime of my days, I would never enter into a ſecond marriage.—I loved you for your likeneſs to your dear mother: but that mother never
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0374500100:76"/>
deceiv'd me—and there the likeneſs fails—you have repaid my affection with diſſimulation—Clariſſa, you ſhould have truſted me.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>As for you, Mr. Lionel, what terms can I find ſtrong enough to paint the exceſs of my friendſhip?—I loved, I eſteemed, I honoured your father: he was a brave, a generous, and a ſincere man; I thought you inherited his good qualities—you were left an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, I adopted you, put you upon the footing of my own ſon; educated you like a gentleman; and deſign'd you for a profeſſion, to which, I thought, your virtues would have been an ornament.</p>

                  <p>What return you have made me, you ſeem to be acquainted with yourſelf; and, therefore, I ſhall not repeat it—Yet, remember as an aggravation of your guilt, that the laſt mark of my bounty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon you in the very inſtant, when you were undermining my deſigns. Now, Sir, I have but one thing more to ſay to you—Take my daughter; was ſhe worth millions, ſhe is at your ſervice.</p>

                  <p>You have not erred, my dear daughter; you have diſtinguiſh'd. It is I ſhould aſk pardon, for this little trial of you; for I am happier in the ſon-in-law you have given me, than if you had married a prince.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>I think I hear a coach drive into the court; it is Colonel Oldboy's family; I will go and receive them. Don't make yourſelves uneaſy at this; we muſt endeavour to pacify them as well as we can. My dear Lionel, if I have made you happy, you have made me ſo; Heaven bleſs you, my children, and make you deſerving of one another.</p>

                  <p>No, my dear papa, I am not run away; and upon my knees, I intreat your pardon for the folly I have committed; but, let it be ſome alleviation, that duty, affection, were too ſtrong to ſuffer me to carry it to extremity: and, if you knew the agony I have been in ſince I ſaw you laſt—</p>

                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, don't imagine I want to eſcape; I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſorry for what has happened, but am ready to give you any ſatisfaction you think proper.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Jeſſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Miſs Dy, you are a perfect heroine for a romance—And, pray who is this courteous knight?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady M.</speaker>
                  <p>O Sir, you that I thought ſuch a pretty behav'd gentleman!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Jeſſ.</speaker>
                  <p>What buſineſs are you of, friend?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>My chief trade, Sir, is plain dealing; and, as that is a commodity you have no reaſon to be very fond of, I would not adviſe you to purchaſe any of it by impertinence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>And is this what you would adviſe me to?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>It is, indeed, my dear old friend; as things are ſituated, there is, in my opinion, no other prudent method of proceeding; and it is the method I would adopt myſelf, was I in your caſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I believe you are in the right of it—Say what you will for me then.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>Well! young people, I have been able to uſe a few arguments, which have ſoftened my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour here; and in ſome meaſure pacified his reſentment. I find, Sir, you are a gentleman by your connections?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, till it is found that my character and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily will bear the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny, I deſire no favour—And for fortune—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! rot your fortune, I don't mind that—I know you are a gentleman, or Dick Rantum would not have recommended you. And ſo, Dy, kiſs and friends.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Jeſſ.</speaker>
                  <p>What, Sir, have you no more to ſay to the man who has uſed you ſo ill?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                  <p>Us'd me ill!—That's as I take it—he has done a mettled thing; and, perhaps, I like him the better for it; it's long before you would have ſpirit enough to run away with a wench—Harman, give me your hand; let's hear no more of this now.</p>
