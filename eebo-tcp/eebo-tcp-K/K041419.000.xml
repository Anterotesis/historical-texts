            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Ruptures are diſorders, on which, very prepoſterouſly, a character of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace has been faſtened, ſo almoſt all thoſe of our ſex, who labour under them, imagine theſe infirmities to be a ſtain to their honour; they fix upon them a kind of ignominy, which is the reaſon, that inſtead of having recourſe to the remedies proper for them, they would, by a miſplaced ſhame, diſſemble them to others, and even conceal from themſelves the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the danger they are in.</p>
            <p>We ſhall find this delicacy to be quite out of place, if we conſider, that theſe diſorders are the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of all thoſe afflicting human bodies; that they are the growth of every country, the fate of every age,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0010503100:3"/>and of every condition in life, and that they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen through cauſes much more ſimple and innocent, than moſt of thoſe producing the other diſtempers.</p>
            <p>'Tis through the conviction of this truth, that perſons of diſtinguiſhed rank, who have deigned to own their miſtake on this head, have prevailed upon me to publiſh the following inſtructions. Their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was, that all perſons afflicted, as they were, might learn to lay aſide their prejudices, and ſet about to procure for themſelves the means of aid theſe diſorders call for.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of my life put me in a capacity of acquitting myſelf of this duty, with all the preciſion neceſſary to a work of this nature: Born in the boſom of ſurgery, and brought up under the inſtructions of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> author of the treatiſe on theſe diſtempers, publiſhed not long ſince, I have been enabled (tho' the only one of my ſex) to merit the honour of being admitted into the number of the ſurgeons of <hi>Paris,</hi> for the treatment of Ruptures in women. Some perſons, jealous of my talents, do indeed diſpute me this privilege, and attempt to miſguide the public on my ſcore; but the patent, or letters of my Reception, ſubjoined to this preface, muſt defeat all ſuch ſurmiſes, in juſtifying my title to that honour.</p>
            <p>To come up fully to my engagements, I propoſe, in theſe inſtructions, to put perſons of my ſex on their guard againſt the untoward ſymptoms attending ruptures. Theſe diſorders, which are ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0010503100:4"/>enemies, becauſe unknown, will no ſooner be diſcovered than be deſtroyed. Each patient will be in condition, upon reading this diſſertation with a ſmall degree of attention, to become acquainted with theſe maladies, and their cure: No longer ſhall any one be able to alledge her want of knowledge for excuſe; nor any longer be reſtrained, by reaſons of decency or modeſty, on a conviction of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in theſe kinds of diſorders.</p>
            <p>All the views of the perſons, for whom I write, are here fully anſwered, in the order I obſerve for their inſtruction. I ſet out with the notion of Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in general; then I enter upon a particular detail of each of theſe diſorders: I deſcribe the parts where they are formed, in proportion as I come to ſpeak to the differences of theſe diſtempers: I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their cauſes, their ſymptoms and ſigns; ſo that, with a glance of the eye, the female reader may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted with each particular caſe. <hi>Finally,</hi> I come to ſpeak to the means of effecting a radical cure upon them. And, among all the means, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages or truſſes being the moſt common and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, I enlarge, as much as poſſible, on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of making and adjuſting them to the body of the patient. I lay down the neceſſary rules for taking the proper meaſures of the body, in order to execute them well, and I point at the inconveniencies which ſome have oppoſed to the uſe of theſe machines: And every one not being in caſe of having the neceſſary relief againſt the ſtrangulation of the gut, each
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0010503100:5"/>female patient will here find the moſt efficacious remedies, and eaſy of execution, that can poſſibly be employed againſt that ſymptom, and by their means may remove it themſelves.</p>
            <p>I have avoided, as much as poſſible, the uſe of the terms of art, which are always uncouth to perſons not of the profeſſion, and ſubſtituted in their ſtead thoſe of a more familiar and common uſe.</p>

               <p>WHAT A RUPTURE IS. Ruptures are tumours or ſwellings formed by the iſſuing forth of certain parts contained in the belly.</p>
               <p>They are ſo called, becauſe there is produced a kind or diviſion or ſeparation of ſome of the parts of the belly, which ſerve to contain the caul, the guts, the liver, the ſpleen, the ſtomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe parts, which ſeparate of divide, are called the muſcles, and theſe have five natural apertures or openings, which ſerve to give exit or iſſue from the belly to certain neceſſary parts. Of theſe openings I ſhall ſpeak in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapter.</p>
               <p>DIVISION OF RUPTURES. Ruptures are divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into true and falſe.</p>
               <p>TRUE. The true Ruptures are thoſe formed by the coming forth of thoſe parts contained in the lower belly.</p>
               <p>FALSE. The falſe Ruptures are tumours or ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings formed by the collection of the blood, the lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha, or other humours, in the parts where the true Ruptures happen.</p>
               <p>DISTINCTION OF RUPTURES. Ruptures are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed according to the parts of which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and the places they poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>DIFFERENCES. They differ among themſelves on the ſcore of the parts of which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; in that ſome are formed by the guts; others by the caul; and others, again, by the guts and the caul together.</p>
               <p>UNCOMMON RUPTURES. There are alſo ſome Ruptures formed by the ſtomach, the bladder (which happens, rarely); others by the ovaries, and the womb paſſing thro' the openings, in the bending of the groin; but theſe ſorts of Ruptures happen ſtill more rarely: and ſo, without inſiſting on a particular detail of them, which would throw confuſion into the diſcourſe, I ſhall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0010503100:12"/>only mention thoſe produced by the gut and the caul; to which I ſhall add thoſe of the womb, and the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fundament.</p>
               <p>DIFFERENCES OF TRUE RUPTURES. The true Ruptures differ among themſelves, from the places they poſſeſs; in that ſome happen in the navel; and theſe are therefore called <hi>umbilical hernia's,</hi> or Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the navel: Others in the groin, and theſe are called inguinal: Others, in the bending of the thighs, and called crural: Others, again, are formed in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of the ſurface of the belly, and called ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral, or Ruptures of the belly.</p>
               <p>There are, beſides, other Ruptures which happen in other parts, and which, for that reaſon, differ from theſe others; as ſome happen in the loins, others in the vagina; others, again, which are formed at the holes at the bottom of the haunch-bones; but I ſhall wave ſpeaking of all theſe different ſorts of Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they happen but very rarely, to engage our attention here; theſe extraordinary caſes claiming only the attention of the people of the art or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

PHYSICIANS call cauſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes every affection againſt nature, which produces, or which concurs to produce, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The cauſes of Ruptures are divided into remoter or primitive, and into proximate or determining.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0010503100:15"/>
               <p>REMOTE CAUSES. The remote cauſes are thoſe, which ariſe from the temperament or conſtitution, which the patients bring with them into the world, or from the diſpoſition they acquire by their manner of living. It is not to be doubted, but that children ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily enough inherit the good or bad qualities of the ſoul and body of their parents; ſo that there is nothing more certain, than that robuſt parents predate ſtrong and vigorous children; and the delicate, children of the like delicacy of conſtitution with themſelves; the gouty, gouty; and die phthiſical, phthiſical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thoſe who have Ruptures commonly enough children with the like indiſpoſitions with themſelves; conſequently the moſt remote cauſes of Ruptures may be traced up to the diſpoſition which is communicated to the child at the moment of its conception.</p>
               <p>PRIMITIVE CAUSES, WHENCE THEY MOST COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONLY PROCEED. It is much more common to find the primitive or remote cauſes of theſe diſeaſes in the manner of living. All the parts which are contained in the belly, and all thoſe which form it, are naturally ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and relaxed by the too moiſt air which is reſpired; by the marſhy places which are inhabited; by the too relaxing aliments that are uſed, as the too thin milk of a nurſe of a bad conſtitution; by the oil, the butter, the too great quantity of water, ſmall-beer, and other the like drinks.</p>
               <p>DETERMINING CAUSES. Every thing that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of determining the parts, already relaxed, to come forth, is conſidered as immediate cauſes of theſe diſorders. Loud crying, leaping, ſtraining, conſtipation, pregnancy, and child-bearing, force the parts contained in the belly to ſtretch, and come out at thoſe places where they happen to find the leaſt degree of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0010503100:16"/>
               <p>NATURAL OPENINGS. In the belly there are five natural openings; but which are neither apparent, nor even ſurmiſed to be there, by perſons unacquainted with anatomy; becauſe, like all the other parts, they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the ſkin and fat. Of theſe five openings the navel is the firſt; two others are ſituated in the groin, and called <hi>rings;</hi> two others in the bendings of the thighs, and called <hi>arcades</hi> or <hi>archs.</hi> Theſe openings, in their natural ſtate, are exactly filled by other parts, which are deſtined to come forth of the belly. In the hole of the navel are the remains of the navel-ſtring, which, during the time the child is in the body of the mother, ſerves to convey nouriſhment to it. Thro' the rings paſs two ſorts of ſtrings, which ſerve to ſupport the womb, and are called the round ligaments of the womb. Below each of the arcades paſs the veſſels, which carry the blood for nouriſhing the inferior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
               <p>PRETERNATURAL OPENINGS. Beſides the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral openings, thro' which the parts contained in the belly may come out, there are, beſides, others very often formed in all the anterior ſurface of the belly; becauſe the parts, which are under the ſkin and the fat, called muſcles, and which ſerve to form the belly, are ſuſceptible of ſeparations and diviſions, which let out the caul and the guts. Beſides the muſcles, there is another part, which immediately covers all thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the belly; this part is called the <hi>peritoneum.</hi> This peritoneum does not divide; but is capable of being extended and lengthened conſiderably, tho' of a very delicate texture, its thickneſs reſembling nearly that of a hog's bladder; it always forms a part of the Rupture, and ſerves as a covering to the guts, when out of the belly, in the ſame manner as in it. It is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0010503100:17"/>called the herniary ſac, when out of the belly; an appellation very ſignificant, ſince it ſerves as a ſac to contain the Rupture.</p>
               <p>IMMEDIATE OR DETERMINING CAUSES. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to find the immediate cauſes of hernia's or Ruptures, and at the ſame time guard againſt them, it ſufficeth to attend to the general idea, which we have juſt now formed from the natural openings in the belly, and from thoſe which may be produced therein in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, by the ſeparation of the muſcles. When the firſt or primitive cauſes have brought the parts contained in the belly to a ſtate of relaxation, by the great quantity of moiſture communicated to the blood by the natural conſtitution, by the method of living, or by the air reſpired, how inconſiderable ſoever the efforts or ſtrainings happen to be, the guts will be diſpoſed to make their way out of the belly by the parts, where they find the leaſt reſiſtence. Now, as they find leſs at the natural openings, or in the parts diſpoſed to ſeparate, they will not fail to come out of the belly at theſe places, and form one or ſeveral Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to the greater or leſs degree of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they meet with in any of thoſe parts.</p>

               <p>WHAT A SIGN IS. THE ſigns in diſeaſes are ſenſible marks, which diſcover, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from each other. Some of them diſcover the preſent ſtate, the character, and the ſpecies of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0010503100:18"/>diſeaſe; and they are called diagnoſtic. Others again enable us to judge of the iſſue of a diſeaſe; and theſe are called prognoſtic.</p>
               <p>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS OF RUPTURES. The dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtic ſigns, common to all true hernia's or Ruptures, differ according to the progreſs of the diſeaſe. When the Rupture is juſt about forming, the patient feels a ſmall pain, like that of an excoriation, or ruffling of the ſkin, and that within the belly; when the Rupture encreaſes, the patient perceives, on applying the hand, a ſmall ſwelling, which diſappears upon preſſing with the finger: When entirely formed, collical pains are from time to time felt in the part of the Rupture, and which extend to the parts about the navel. The dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtic ſigns, common to all the ſpecies of true her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia's, do, beſides, diſcover what parts they conſiſt of, whether of the gut or caul, or of both together. Thoſe conſiſting of the gut are known by a ſmall rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling noiſe cauſed by the wind and the fluid matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the gut, which rumbling is heard, eſpecially, upon handling the Rupture, in order to procure its return.</p>
               <p>Thoſe formed of the caul diſcover themſelves, upon the touch, by a doughy reſiſtance, like what we feel, when we come to handle a piece of tripe. In thoſe formed of the gut and caul together, theſe ſigns are mixt, that is to ſay, they are found combined.</p>
               <p>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS OF RUPTURES. In regard to prognoſtic ſigns, it may be ſaid, in general, that Ruptures are very troubleſome diſorders, when they are neglected, and come to be atttended with ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms: Thoſe formed of the gut are more dangerous than thoſe formed of the caul; thoſe happening in the navel and belly, more difficult to cure than thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0010503100:19"/>called inguinal; and thoſe happening in the bending of the thigh, are, of all, the moſt difficult of cure.</p>
               <p>The hernia's of the womb are, in general, more troubleſome than dangerous.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the fundament, called the falling of the fundament, are the leaſt dangerous; but the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to cure.</p>
               <p>In fine, all of them are ſo much the more difficult to cure, as they are of an older ſtanding; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſs ſo in children.</p>

               <p>WHAT A SYM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PTOM IS. EVERY thing that ſupervenes or happens upon a diſeaſe, and renders it more grievous, is called a ſymptom; as, for inſtance, a flux of blood coming upon a looſeneſs, a dalirium upon a fever, and the like.</p>
               <p>STRANGULATION. Of all the ſymptoms of Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that of the ſtrangulation is the moſt formidable and dangerous, and againſt which patients ſhould be moſt on their guard, either in preventing it, or ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the means of cure, and uſing them inſtantly upon this ſymptom; never ſo little neglected, it is impoſſible for the experteſt ſurgeon to remedy it. The death of the late queen is too ſenſible an inſtance of this truth, not to be capable of ſtriking every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; for who could procure better means of aſſiſtance than ſhe upon this melancholy occaſion?</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0010503100:20"/>
               <p>WHAT STRANGULATION IS. By ſtrangulation we underſtand a degree of ſtraitening, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens thro' the ſtrong compreſſion of the parts tho' which the gut paſſes, and which no longer ſuffer it to return into the belly. In this caſe, then, the gut is ſtrangled, and this ſtrangulation cannot happen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out two other ſymptoms extremely eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; the firſt is an inflammation and gangrene; the ſecond, an impediment to the paſſage of the feces into the gut; from whence it neceſſarily follows, that the feces muſt return by the mouth, by throwing them up, if the return of the gut into the belly be not procured, for the feces to take their ordinary courſe by the fundament.</p>
               <p>Tho' ſomeimes it happens, that it is not above five or ſix hours before the feces return by the mouth; yet this is not ſo commonly the caſe: The vomiting comes on for the moſt part on the 3d or 4th day; ſometimes not till after 8, 9 and 10 days; but the patients are afflicted with ſuch ſymptoms, as by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the vomiting, anounce and characterize the ſtrangulation of the gut ſo diſtinctly, that every one who will but attend, can never miſtake the caſe.</p>
               <p>Here follows the detail of the ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>FIRST, The Rupture grows bigger than ordinary.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, Cauſes much pain.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, Baffles all attempts to reduce it.</p>
               <p>FOURTHLY, The pain extends as far as round the navel, if the Rupture be in the bending of the thigh; if in the navel, the pain, beginning there, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the groin.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0010503100:21"/>
               <p>FIFTHLY, The pains called gripes hold only for ſome minutes; but recur from time to time, and the diſorder they cauſe, is daily increaſing.</p>
               <p>SIXTHLY, Upon theſe gripings comes wind, which is plentifully diſcharged at the mouth; the patient can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcharge it by the fundament, notwithſtanding all the inclination ſhe ſeems to have to do it by that part.</p>
               <p>SEVENTHLY, The patient is troubled with loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or an inclination to vomit, which terminate in a plentiful ſalivation, thick and glutinous.</p>
               <p>EIGHTHLY, At laſt the patient throws up the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then, come the feces, whole taſte and ſmell are extremely nauſeous.</p>
               <p>During the ſeries and increaſe of the ſymptoms, the Rupture ſwells, the belly turns hard, and very big, a fever comes on, and heightens more and more.</p>
               <p>But, on the cloſe of the diſtemper, the vomitings ſlacken, the patient is afflicted with hiccups, the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſides, and becomes inſenſible, the Rupture turns ſoft and livid; the ſight fails; the pulſe turns inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and languiſhing, at length is totally loſt, and the patient dies for want of having foreſeen the means of guarding againſt a death ſhe might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>
               <p>ADHESIONS. Ruptures are, beſides, ſubject to another ſymptom, called adheſion; 'tis an union, which is made between the parts coming out of the belly, and thoſe without it, as the fat and ſkin; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The parts which are attached externally, can no longer return into the belly.</p>
               <p>But how ſhould we avoid a danger unknown, how guard againſt theſe ſymptoms, if we are uninſtructed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0010503100:22"/>about them? Poſſibly 'tis only by reading; and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it the more uſeful, I propoſe to deſcribe each ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Rupture in particular; after which I ſhall communicate the means to guard againſt, and remedy them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Ruptures of the navel.</head>
               <p>EXPLANATION OF THE PART. THE navel, as I have already hinted, is a hole deſtined to give paſſage into the belly of the infant, during its ſtay in the body of the mother, to what we call the navel-ſtring. It conſiſts of three ſorts of veſſels; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a vein, two arteries, and a canal called urachus: This ſtring is a continuation of the veſſels which form the after-birth, which after-birth is attached to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the womb. By means of the vein, which is a part of this ſtring, the blood is conveyed from the mother to the child, for its nouriſhment and growth; and the blood returned back to the mother by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the two arteries.</p>
               <p>The urachus is a canal coming from the bladder of the child, for relieving it of the urine, by conveying it into the blood of the mother. When the child comes to the world, this ſtring is tied up with a thread, and cut, to prevent the flux of the blood of the child; ſo that the hole of the navel is filled by the navel-ſtring, yet imperfectly enough, as it afterwards comes to ſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and dry.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0010503100:23"/>
               <p>CHARACTER OF THE DISEASE. When we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at any time to ſtrain much, the gut or the caul eaſily comes out at the hole of the navel, becauſe there a leſs, degree of reſiſtence is found than any where elſe.</p>
               <p>DIFFERENCES AND CAUSES. The Ruptures of the navel are not only formed at the hole itſelf of the navel, but ſome more commonly happen at the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of this hole, becauſe theſe parts are very weak, and eaſily dilate by any violent efforts, or gentler efforts often reiterated. Women are very ſubject to this ſpecies of Rupture. The reaſon is, that, in pregnancy, the belly is extremely extended, the hole of the navel enlarged more than in the natural ſtate, or that its circumference yields and gives way more eaſily than all the other parts; becauſe, as was ſaid, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the navel is weaker than the navel it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The ſwelling and elevation of this part is the characteriſtical mark of the Rupture, eſpecially if this ſwelling diſappears when abed, or when preſſed with the fingers.</p>
               <p>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. In general this ſpecies of Ruptures is very difficult to cure: The ſmall ones, and recent, are more dangerous than thoſe of a longer ſtanding; but theſe of a longer ſtanding are of more difficult cure. Theſe diſeaſes are very dangerous in children; but more eaſily cured than in perſons of an advanced age.</p>
               <p>SYMPTOMS. The Symptoms of the Ruptures of the navel are the ſame, in general, with thoſe in all the other ſpecies of hernias. One, peculiar to and common in them, is a ſpecies of ſlight colic, leſs painful than troubleſome, which the patients are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0010503100:24"/>afflicted with when up, and which encreaſes after eating.</p>
               <p>CURE. The Art of ſurgery ſupplies three different means of cure for this ſpecies of Rupture. The firſt is what is called the palliative: The ſecond, the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and the third, is the means of remedying the ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>THE PALLIATIVE CURE is that by means of which we only attempt to prevent the ſymptoms, by keeping the parts in the belly by bandages or truſſes, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly cloſe up the hole, at which the parts come out, and hinder their coming out when once returned into the belly. This method of cure ſuits the hernias, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with inconveniencies, which oppoſe their radical cure, as thoſe of too old a ſtanding, thoſe of too conſiderable a bulk, and thoſe happening to women who are ſubject to have children.</p>
               <p>THE RADICAL CURE is that by which Ruptures are cured by the remedies proper in theſe diſeaſes; of which I ſhall ſpeak in chap. xiv; as in chap. ix. of the means of removing the ſymptoms.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Rupture of the groin.</head>
               <p>EXPLANATION OF THE PART. THE Author of nature has ſo diſpoſed the belly, that there are two holes, which anſwer to the parts, called the groin. Theſe holes are deſtined to give paſſage from the belly on each ſide in women to a ſpecies of round ſtring, called from its figure, the round ligament of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0010503100:25"/>womb; it ſerves to keep that part in its place. The holes, thro' which theſe ligaments paſs, are, from their figure, which is nearly round, called rings. In the natural ſtate, theſe holes are filled by the parts which paſs thro' them; but, upon violent ſtrainings, they enlarge gradually, and at laſt give paſſage to the gut or caul, or to both together, out of the belly, and ſuffer them to form the Ruptures of the groin; they are called inguinal hernias or Ruptures.</p>
               <p>DIFFERENCES. The hernias of the groin are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and have different appellations according to the place they occupy. Some remain in the bending of the groin; theſe they call incompleat: Others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the great lip of the natural parts; and theſe are called compleat.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The particular cauſe of inguinal hernias proceeds from the rings being ſituated in the loweſt part of the belly, which are continually relaxed by a certain quantity of water found at the bottom of the belly: If then the determining cauſes come to act, theſe parte being naturally open, and ſituated in the loweſt part of the belly, the guts or the caul inſinuate eaſily into them.</p>
               <p>The determining cauſes are, loud crying, leaping, the ſtrainings made to cough, at ſtool, in child-bed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The neglect of remedying the incompleat Rupture of the groin is the moſt immediate cauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Rupture; for if its progreſs be not ſtopp'd by bandages, it is natural to think that it muſt daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe more and more, and arrive at that pitch, that all the guts ſhall come down to the great lip. Nothing is more common than ſuch ſorts of Ruptures. They
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0010503100:26"/>are ſometimes obſerved of the bigneſs of one's head, and hanging down to the thighs.</p>
               <p>SYMPTOMS. The parts which ought to continue in the belly, which is their natural place, cannot be thus diſarrang'd, without this conſequence, a conſiderable diſorder in the ſtate of the health; for the guts cannot come down ſo low, and the ſtomach at the ſame time not be pulled down and diſplaced. As the guts are a continuation of the ſtomach, it then but imperfectly performs the digeſtion of the aliments; the patients are afflicted with windy colicks; the twitchings, to which the guts, the ſtomach, and other parts contained in the belly, are ſubject, cauſe almoſt continual weakneſſes, which are improperly aſcribed to the cravings of hunger.</p>
               <p>It rarely happens, that theſe large hernias are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſtrangulation; but ſhould that happen, it is ever with the moſt imminent danger.</p>
               <p>The incompleat hernias are rarely ſubject to the ſymptoms above deſcribed, yet more than the others ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſtrangulation; becauſe the rings, not having loſt their ſpring, as in the compleat hernias, are more in caſe to make an impreſſion upon the parts, and hinder their return, which conſtitutes the ſtrangulation. It is, beſides, true, that it is eaſier to guard againſt their ſtrangulation, becauſe eaſier to keep them in with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages or truſſes.</p>
               <p>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The incompleat hernia of the groin is diſtinguiſh'd by its facility of coming our and returning again, when not adherent, and by the ſigns of the compleat hernia.</p>
               <p>The compleat hernia is alſo diſtinguiſhed by its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of returning again, when not adherent: If adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that is, if attach'd to the exterior parts, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0010503100:27"/>of the gut, we feel in it a certain degree of flexibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, like that which is felt on compreſſing a bladder not quite full of water: If the hernia be formed of the caul, on the touch we perceive a ſoftneſs, like that we feel in handling a piece of tripe. If the hernia conſiſts of both theſe parts, the ſigns are then mixt; we feel, in handling the tumour, that flexibility, and at the ſame time, that ſoftneſs juſt now mentioned.</p>
               <p>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. We may affirm of the hernias or Ruptures of the groin, that the incompleat are more dangerous than the compleat, and alſo of more eaſy cure; for in the compleat, the diſarrangement of the parts is more conſiderable; but the hole of the ring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing larger, they are leſs ſubject to ſtrangulation.</p>
               <p>CURE. The hernias of the groin are ſuſceptible of three different methods of cure; of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter, <hi>viz.</hi> the palliative, the radical, and of that which conſiſts in removing their ſymptoms.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the crural hernia.</head>
               <p>EXPLANATION OF THE PART. IN the bending of the thigh, juſt in the middle, under the ſkin and the fat, there is an opening to one ſide of the ring; this opening, which is called the crural arcade, has in effect nearly the figure of a ſmall arcade or arch. It ſerves to give paſſage out of the belly to the veſſels which carry the blood for the nouriſhment of the thigh, the leg, and the foot, and to thoſe which reconvey it from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0010503100:28"/>theſe parts. Theſe veſſels are called crural, and the rupture made by this hole is alſo called crural.</p>
               <p>This Species of Rupture happens more commonly to women who have had children than to others.</p>
               <p>DIFFERENCES. The crural hernias differ only in bulk or ſize: the biggeſt exceed not a hen's egg, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily they are much leſs.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The increaſe of the volume or bulk of the womb, in proportion as the woman advances in her pregnancy, is the particular cauſe of that ſpecies of hernia, the guts being then obliged to bear in greater quantity on the ſides of the belly; and as in this caſe, the muſcles are ſtretched much, and their openings, called arcades, are more patent, the guts or the caul eſcape more eaſily at theſe openings, in the great ſtrainings of women with child in the act of coughing, at ſtool, or in labour.</p>
               <p>SYMPTOMS. They are very ſubject to adheſions on account of the continual rubbings or colliſions they undergo in the motion of the thigh. The bandages being ill-made, contribute thereto much: They are alſo ſubject to ſtrangulation.</p>
               <p>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The diagnoſtic ſigns of this ſpecies of hernia are the ſame with thoſe of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat hernia of the groin: The ſituation beſpeaks its ſpecies, with reſpect to the place it occupies.</p>
               <p>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. The crural hernia is very dangerous, from the difficulty there is of reducing it into the belly; in caſe of a ſtrangulation, the operation is much more dangerous. The radical cure of it is very difficult to compaſs; nay it is not an eaſy matter to keep it in with bandages; unleſs they are made with much care and judgment; ſo that one may affirm in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0010503100:29"/>general, that this ſpecies of Rupture is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the ventral hernia.</head>
               <p>WHAT THE BELLY IS. THE belly conſiſts of ſoft parts, which are the ſkin, the fat, and the muſcles. By muſcles we underſtand thoſe parts of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which are known by the name of fleſh, which conſiſts of red fibres or ſtrings, which eaſily ſeparate, when the meat or fleſh is boiled. Theſe ſtrings are joined to each other by other ſmaller ſtrings of another ſpecies, and which are ſo fine and delicate, that the ſight ſcarce diſcerns them. It is eaſy to conceive that theſe fleſhy ſtrings may divide and ſeparate from each other, by the ſtrainings we may happen to exert, and that the opening, which this diviſion forms, may give paſſage out of the belly to the guts and caul with as much eaſe as the natural holes, of which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken. Theſe ſorts of ruptures, which may be thus formed, in all the extent of the belly, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ventral hernias.</p>
               <p>DIFFERENCES. The different places of the belly, where theſe Ruptures happen, characterize their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for ſome of them may happen about the navel; others below; others again on the ſides of the belly. In fine, they may happen in all the parts of its ſurface, and they ever are Ruptures of the belly, otherwiſe called ventral hernias. All of them may be produced by the gut or caul, or by both together.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0010503100:30"/>
               <p>CAUSES. The great extenſions the muſcles are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to in pregnancy, and in the dropſy, are the proximate and moſt common cauſes of theſe ſpecies of ruptures: yet violent ſtrainings may give occaſion to them.</p>
               <p>SYMPTOMS. Of all the ſpecies of Ruptures there is none that fatigues and ſpends the patients more; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in theſe caſes there is an extreme relaxation in all the parts of the belly. The continual twitchings the patients are expoſed to, incapacitate them almoſt to walk; they are ever complaining of weakneſſes and ſinkings, eſpecially after meals, which allow them no other poſture but that of ſitting or lying down. Theſe Ruptures alſo are ſubject to ſtrangulation and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The ventral hernias are known by their ſoftneſs, their elaſticity, and the facility with which they come out of the belly, and are again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, eſpecially at their beginning.</p>
               <p>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. Theſe ſpecies of hernias are incurable. They are not ſo ſubject to ſtrangulation as the other Ruptures, but ſhould it happen upon them, it is highly difficult to remedy; theſe ſorts of Ruptures are then very dangerous.</p>
               <p>CURE. The palliative cure is the only one that ſuits here, ſuch is the application of bandages; but no ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, are of more difficult execution than thoſe for ſuch Ruptures: And I may without preſumption af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that no one, beſides myſelf, has hitherto found out the commodious, and ſure means of keeping in theſe ruptures, ſo as to prevent their coming out in what ſituation or poſition ſoever the patients are put.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the means of remedying the ſtrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</head>
               <p>WHAT STRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GULATION IS. THE ſtrangulation, as was ſaid in chap. iv. is ſo conſiderable a ſtraitning of the gut, formed by the conſtriction of the parts thro' which it comes out of the belly, that its return is not poſſible. In this caſe we ſee, that it muſt be expoſed to all the ſymptoms, of which I have given a detail in the ſame chapter, and of what importance it is to remedy it ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>THREE MEANS TO BE USED. The ſtrangulation is remedied by three means. The firſt conſiſts in the ſituation, in which the patient ſhould remain. The ſecond, in the uſe of proper remedies. The third, in replacing the gut.</p>
               <p>FIRST MEANS. In the ſtrangulation of any ſpecies of hernia whatever, we muſt procure to the parts, which are too much extended, a ſuitable relaxation, to leſſen the ſtraitning of the gut. The patient then ſhould be laid upon her back, the buttocks and breaſt be raiſed by means of pillows; by this ſituation the exterior parts of the belly are leſs extended, and the ruptured guts are made to have a greater tendency to return.</p>
               <p>SECOND MEANS. The patient being in this ſituation, the ſuitable remedies muſt be forthwith uſed, and thoſe proper to promote the reduction of the parts. Each country, each practitioner, has his peculiar remedies; but as ſome of them are approved by all the people of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0010503100:32"/>the profeſſion, and every-where to be met with; 'tis on ſuch I ſhall inſiſt, to the end that the inſtructed patients may uſe them directly, and till they can have recourſe to the aid of their ſurgeon. The coldeſt and the hardeſt water, as that of a pump, thrown imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the Rupture, is the moſt efficacious reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and which ought to be uſed the firſt, if one is ſo happy as to apply it in the firſt moments of the diſeaſe; if the patient be laid on a bed, and we apprehenſive of wetting it, it will be ſufficient to dip rags in this water, and applying them on the affected part, ſhift them every minute; to this water may be added half the quantity of vinegar. It is to be obſerved, that this remedy, which is the moſt ſovereign of all thoſe we are going to preſcribe, would prove highly dangerous, if not uſed, at leaſt, at the very firſt; becauſe after that, it diſpoſes the guts to a gangrene; but being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applied, it promotes the return of the gut with as much eaſe as the moſt dextrous hand, and the moſt accuſtomed to this operation.</p>
               <p>If theſe remedies have not been applied, for want of being able to ſeize on the critical moment, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt be blooded directly, and that till ſhe faints away, and the ſurgeon to improve the moment of the ſwooning, (during which all the parts are in a ſtate of relaxation) to procure the return of the Rupture.</p>
               <p>But it may happen that this means has not ſucceeded, either thro' the diſpoſition of the patient, or the little experience of the ſurgeon; in that caſe we muſt apply on the Rupture the remedies capable of relaxing the ſtrangling parts. Nothing is more fitted to produce this effect than the crum of bread boiled in water or milk; we may add to it oil. This poultice is wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0010503100:33"/>up in a ſmall bag of fine cloth: But we here ſtill more uſefully employ warm milk put into a hog's blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and applied on the ailing part, or an omelet made with oil; that of nuts is the beſt. Theſe applications ſhould be ſhifted every three hours, and during the uſe of them, the patient to be let the ſame quantity of blood every three hours alſo, taking at each time 5 or 6 ounces.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we thus labour to procure the relaxation of the parts which ſtrangle the gut, we muſt endeavour to void the matters which may be evacuated from the guts, by means of ſmall gliſters of river water, in which has been boiled wheat-bran, and into which is put a tea-ſpoonful of ſugar or common ſalt; by thus voiding the guts, we alſo procure a relaxation to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts, by bathing and moiſtening them.</p>
               <p>If theſe remedies prove ineffectual for two days, we ought not to heſitate a moment to procure the aid of ſome able ſurgeon, who is to act in conſequence of the violence of the ſymptoms; (for then they heighten more and more) while we wait for his aſſiſtance we muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a poultice made of crum of bread boiled in red wine.</p>
               <p>In all caſes, wherein we uſe crum of bread, it muſt be crumbled very fine and ſmooth.</p>
               <p>REGIMEN. During the courſe of the diſeaſe, the patients muſt have no nouriſhment, becauſe they throw up all they take, and what is given them is quite loſt upon them; beſides, the feeding them excites the vomiting, which comes on but too often.</p>
               <p>A few ſpoonfuls of broth are ſufficient at times, and a few ſpoonfuls of the ſimpleſt and lighteſt drink.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0010503100:34"/>
               <p>THIRD MEANS. The replacing the parts, which is called reduction, is an operation of the hand, which conſiſts in procuring the return, into the belly, of the gut or caul, which were come out.</p>
               <p>It is very difficult to give rules on the manner of performing this operation; beſides, it only concerns the people of the art to be inſtructed therein, and ſo I forbear ſpeaking of it: Such as are curious of knowing the general rules, which may be given on it, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s book, Chap. XIII. Sect. II. Part 1. It is enough for the patients to know that they ought not to quit their bed, after the reduction of the parts, before they are guarded with a proper bandage, to ſtop up the hole, thro' which the guts or caul were come out, and prevent this accident from happening again. As life depends on ſuch ſort of machines, and that the patients are incapable of judging of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I am in the following chapter to give the exacteſt rules poſſible to judge of their good or ill conſtruction, and thereby enable the patients themſelves to determine about the advantages and diſadvantages which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from bandages or truſſes well or ill made.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the truſſes proper for the different ſpecies of Ruptures.</head>
               <p>WHAT A TRUSS IS. TRUSSES are ſolid bands made in form of a circle, applied round the body, to oppoſe the iſſuing forth of the Ruptures.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0010503100:35"/>
               <p>THE MATTER OF TRUSSES. The matter of which truſſes are made, is a compoſition of iron and ſteel forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together ſo as to acquire a ſolid conſiſtence, elaſtic and incapable of warping: This laſt matter ſhould only make a third, a half, or two thirds of the truſs, the reſt to be of leather, the whole lined with cloth proper to guard againſt the hardneſs of the iron-work.</p>
               <p>THE PARTS OF THE TRUSS. It is neceſſary to know the parts of the truſs before we learn to make the proper application of it, or determine its poſition: Three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts are to be obſerved in the iron-work of the truſs; the plate, the circle, and the tail. The plate is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior extremity, deſtined to faſten a cuſhion, which ought to ſtop up the hole of the belly; on the outſide of this plate is a hook for faſtening the girdle of leather: The circle is the part extending from the plate as far as to the tail; the tail is the poſterior extremity of the iron-work, to which is faſtened the girdle of leather. The plate or the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhion is alſo called the point of compreſſion; the tail, the point of ſupport.</p>
               <p>THE CONDITIONS OF THE TRUSS. The iron-work ſhould be adjuſted in ſuch a manner as to apply or fit exactly quite round the body, as otherwiſe it would be apt to bear falſe, or warp, gall the patient, and never cloſe up the hole exactly, the Rupture be apt to fall out, the plate of the truſs be galling, and give occaſion to the adheſion, an untoward ſymptom, of which we have ſpoke in chap. iv.</p>
               <p>TRUSS OF STEEL. The truſs of ſteel is the only one which may be applied round the body, without being ſubject to any variation or warping, its turn or rounding being well moulded to the ſhape of the body for which it is made, renders it firm, invariable and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0010503100:36"/>incapable of ſhifting place, in what ſituation ſoever the patients put themſelves.</p>
               <p>SPRING-TRUSS. Some workmen have imagined they gave a great degree of perfection to the truſs by adding to the cuſhion a ſpring to make it bear downwards, without conſidering that if the compreſſion be greater in the lower part, it is leſs in the upper, where the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture takes a new courſe, and ever and anon comes out.</p>
               <p>JOINT-TRUSSES. Others have deviſed a joint-truſs, the uſe of which is pernicious; for the truſs, which ſhould remain firm upon the body in the different motions of the patients, cannot poſſibly do ſo, its joints ſuffering it to open and cloſe according to the motions of the patients.</p>
               <p>ELASTIC TRUSSES. Many more advantages were imagined to be found in certain truſſes, to which they have given the name of <hi>Elaſtic truſſes of a new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> this elaſtic virtue which conſtitutes their merit is very advantageous when this ſort of truſs is executed by an intelligent hand, who knows how to give the degree of turn or rounding proportioned to the ſhape of the body, on which it is to be applied, a thing extremely difficult; for otherwiſe it ever bears falſe, galls the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and neither reſtrains the Rupture.</p>
               <p>TRUSS WITHOUT STEEL. The truſs without ſteel has all the moſt dangerous inconveniencies poſſible; and we cannot too much caution patients againſt a machine, which may eaſily miſlead, from the notion of reſtraint and pain at firſt excited in the mind by the idea of ſteel, which enters into the compoſition of other truſſes; but if we conſider that the cuſhion of the truſs without ſteel has no fix'd point to render it immoveable, we ſhall come eaſily to underſtand that it cannot effect an exact compreſſion on the hole of the Rupture, but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0010503100:37"/>when the patient is abed, and that in that caſe moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients being able to do without a truſs, this ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes uſeleſs, and proves dagerous in all other ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, as it prevents not the exit of the Rupture.</p>
               <p>Therefore I conclude, from what I have juſt ſaid on the ſubject of truſſes, that thoſe agreeing the beſt are the ſteel-truſſes methodically made, that is, made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and ſpecies of the malady, and turned or rounded to the ſhape and ſtructure of the bodies of the perſons on which they are to be applied. But as it ſufficeth not that patients have truſſes properly conſtructed for them, but further neceſſary, they know how to uſe them to advantage, I ſhall in the following chapter recite the inconveniencies which may happen upon the uſe of theſe machines.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the inconveniencies which may happen during the uſe of truſſes.</head>
               <p>THREE GENERAL INCONVENIENCIES MAY make patients, but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attentive to their ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, loſe all the benefit they ſhould otherwiſe derive from the uſe of truſſes executed according to the rules of art. Some ariſe on the part of the diſeaſe itſelf; others, of the patients; others again, of the truſſes.</p>
               <p>INCONVENIENCIES CHARGEABLE TO THE SCORE OF THE DISEASE. Ruptures of the caul are very difficult to keep in the belly, becauſe that part being a fatty membrane, is very ſlippery; How little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0010503100:38"/>we neglect the retaining them in the belly, they are ever encreaſing; patients ſhould in that caſe then ſubmit to wear their truſſes night and day, and tighter than in a rupture of the gut.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Rupture is found to conſiſt of the gut and caul together, and it may happen that in this caſe the gut enters into, and the caul remains out of the belly without being able to return on account of ſome adheſions which reſtrain it; the patients ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to go without the truſs, as it is neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the coming forth of the gut. Art then directs to make a truſs that ſhall cloſe the hole ſo as to hinder the gut from coming out, yet not over-compreſs the caul, for fear of cauſing ſome alteration therein.</p>
               <p>INCONVENIENCIES TO BE LAID TO THE AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COUNT OF THE PATIENTS. The two extremes of being too thin or too fat are inconveniencies on the part of the patients, which oppoſe the ſtability of the truſs, and make the uſe of it always difficult, unleſs the ſurgeon and the patient, each on their part, give all the attention neceſſary.</p>
               <p>In an extreme leanneſs, the bones being bare and uncovered, but for the ſkin, and theſe bones themſelves forming eminencies and pits, the ſurgeon the moſt verſed in making of truſſes, muſt miſcarry, if he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy not all the attention neceſſary to give them the ſhape proportioned to that of the bones; but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, on their part, ought to apply all their care to keep them in place, as we ſhall ſee in chap. XIII.</p>
               <p>In an extreme of corpulency, the too great quantity of fat gives the hips a difformity ſo contrary to the natural ſtate, that the turn of the truſs ſhould alſo be very different from what is aſſigned it in a moderate corpulency. And it is very difficult for the truſs to be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0010503100:39"/>capable of producing the effect expected from it, if the patient herſelf favour not the intentions, and be not careful to tighten it from time to time.</p>
               <p>THE INCONVENIENCES TO BE MET WITH on the part of the patients, in Ruptures of the navel, equally ariſe from the difformity of the belly, which is more or leſs prominent, more or leſs thin, tight, or ſoft, according to the greater or leſs degree of relaxation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone by the ſkin, the fat and the muſcles in the ſtate of pregnancy, and of conſequence the truſſes for theſe ſorts of Ruptures ſhould be as differently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed as the ſhapes of bellies differ; for if the belly terminate in a point towards the navel, the point of compreſſion eaſily varies; if the navel be found lower than the hips, the point of ſupport or bearing is very difficult to find; if the belly be more raiſed above the navel than below <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, the truſs tends to fall down below the Rupture: All theſe differences call for different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of attention in the make of the truſſes, none of which, in this caſe, are capable of remaining in place, unleſs that ſort of my invention, of which I ſhall ſpeak at the cloſe of this chapter.</p>
               <p>The more the truſs is apt to vary or ſhift, the greater degree of conſtancy the patient ſhould put on, to give it the time to fix or ſettle, and the ſurgeon, on his part, endeavour to mould and fit it to the body of the patient by degrees. In perſons extremely thin, we muſt not at firſt tighten it to the higheſt pitch, the uſe of it would then prove diſcouraging and inſupportable. The parts, that ſerve for ſeat to it muſt inſenſibly be made accuſtomed to its impreſſions. In perſons extremely fat, the ſame precautions muſt be uſed, becauſe the fat can ſubſide but by little and little under the truſs; and ſo it muſt be tightened but in proportion as it ſinks
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0010503100:40"/>in the thickneſs of the fat, without which it would become too wide; theſe degrees of attention ſhould then be divided between the patient and the ſurgeon, till the truſs has acquired a firm and invariable ſituation. The patients ought not to put off their truſs night and day, till they are become accuſtomed to it. When the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have a great facility of coming out, as thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the caul have, every motion muſt be avoided capable of determining the parts to come out, as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtriding, raiſing the arms too high, and ſtrong ſneezing: Finally, if the belly be bound, the patient is obliged to ſtrain much at ſtool, and then it is proper to procure an open belly by means of glyſters, or mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſwallow half an ounce of lenitive electuary; if notwithſtanding this, ſhe be obliged to ſtrain in the leaſt at ſtool, let her reſt her hand on the upper part of the plate of her truſs, to prevent its aſcending; and this ſhe is to do every time ſhe ſneezes or coughs or blows her noſe; becauſe in theſe great motions the cuſhion of the truſs is always determined or apt to aſcend, and then the hole it ſhould ſtop, is found a little uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: By all this attention the parts will be gradually accuſtomed to remain in the belly and acquire the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude of not coming out, and the patients being abed, in that caſe, they may pull off their truſs at night.</p>
               <p>INCONVENIENCIES ON THE PART OF THE TRUSS. We have juſt ſaid that truſſes can only gradually mould themſelves to the bodies of the patients; they are therefore of themſelves ſubject to ſome variation, which muſt neceſſarily be remedied, to procure them the utmoſt degree of perfection; this perfection conſiſts, as I have already ſaid, in the juſt turn or rounding, and exactly proportioned to the parts on which the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0010503100:41"/>truſs is to be applied; for if it bears falſe, I mean, if it bears on one part more than on another of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the belly, it cannot fail to gall, and the point of compreſſion be vicious and irregular; beſide, this defect makes it ſubject to break in the part where is the void or hollow; this defect is not always perceivable at the very firſt time it is applied on, becauſe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namenting, which is new and ſtriking conceals its hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, but after being wore for ſome days, the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting flattens; the fat, which is under the girdle, ſubſides; the leather, which forms the reſt of the circle, lengthens, and the truſs no longer compreſſes in any part of the circumference of the hips, unleſs in the part which bears falſe. This inconvenience, which is conſiderable, is eaſily amended, when we come to be well acquainted with the manner of ordering theſe machines: But a defect common to all the truſſes made for the Ruptures of the groin, and thoſe of the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the thighs, and for which no one before myſelf was ever able to find a remedy, is that they bear leſs on the opening, which they ought to ſtop, when one happens to ſit very low, becauſe then the belly ſinks; this defect ſtands corrected in the truſſes of my manner, to ſo conſiderable a degree of perfection, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients are always ſurprized at not finding that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, after having uſed the common truſſes. And therefore it was found neceſſary to order the patients to ſit always high; but that is not poſſible to be done every where, unleſs one was always to have her ſeat carried about with her, a thing highly inconvenient in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inſtances; this defect is beſides to be met with on many other occaſions, as in perſons very thin, when abed; the cuſhion of the common truſs never bears on the hole in fat perſons, in thoſe of a reaſonable good
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0010503100:42"/>plight of body, in like manner as in the thin; the ſame thing is alſo to be found, when they ſneeze, blow their noſe, cough, or are at ſtool, and all the means propoſed to remedy this inconvenience, are as embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing as uſeleſs, and in no manner come up to the ſimplicity of my truſs, in which there is found none of theſe inconveniencies. Here is the proper, place to mention a diſcovery, which my application to be of ſervice to perſons of my own ſex, put me upon, in reflecting on the lot of many women, whoſe delicacy of conſtitution incapacitates them to go their full time with child.</p>
               <p>The moſt common cauſe of miſcarriages is the ſame with that of Ruptures, it ariſes from the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the parts of the belly, both internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and takes riſe in the too great quantity of ſero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, which water the ligaments, which ought to keep in place each of the parts contained in the belly. Now the ligaments of the womb are ſo often relaxed by the ſeroſities abounding in the blood, that that part remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unsupported, on account of the weakneſs of its ligaments, it is impoſſible the child ſhould come to its full time, becauſe it determines by its weight the womb to remain in the loweſt parts of the belly; and not finding there ſufficient room to grow, dies thro' the conſtraint it undergoes.</p>
               <p>The means I have found to remedy theſe troubleſome diſorders are as ſimple as the following reaſoning, which I uſe to prove its efficacy. The ligaments of the womb, and the muſcles of the lower belly being too much relaxed, the growth of the child is prevented, becauſe the womb tends too much towards the loweſt part of the belly, where it is ſtraitened for room, the muſcles of the belly not being ſtrong enough to ſupport
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0010503100:43"/>it forwards: If by the means of a truſs sufficient to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the relaxation of theſe parts, that defect may be ſupplied, it is not to be doubted but that women ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to miſcarriages will happily go their full time: The experience of upwards a hundred women, to whom I have given this relief, proves it; having often miſcarried, before the uſe of my truſs.</p>
               <p>It is made of a flexible matter without any iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work at all, but ſtrong enough to reſiſt the weight of the belly. It ſtretches in proportion to the growth of the child; nothing is more eaſy to apply and to wear; it puts pregnant women, the moſt ſubject to miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, in a condition to walk and go by any carriages; and it becomes ſo commodious to them, by giving a degree of firmneſs to the whole body, that many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſe it out of the time of their pregnancy. But it proves, beſides, highly uſeful to women, whoſe belly, being very heavy and pendulous, hinders them to walk, and to perſons to whom it is not poſſible to apply the common truſſes of the navel.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> A method for taking the meaſures of the truſſes, neceſſary for perſons afflicted with ruptures.</head>
               <p>PERSONS, who would incline to procure truſſes for themſelves, not always living near great towns, where they are commonly made, have need of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to enable them to ſend their exact meaſure; I imagine it to be uſeful for ſuch, to put them on the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0010503100:44"/>eaſy method of taking exactly the dimenſions of their own bodies, and to inſiſt more particularly on ſome circumſtances they ought to obſerve in relation to the different ſpecies of Ruptures.</p>
               <p>FIRST, The patient ſhould give a particular detail, in an inſtructive memorial, of her conſtitution and age; whether ſhe be maid or married woman; the date of her Rupture; and whether the place ſhe lives in be moiſt and marſhy, or dry.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, She ſhould, as much as may be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the cauſe, which has determined or occaſioned her Rupture, whether a blow, a fall, a fit of coughing, a ſudden effort or ſtraining, or child-bearing.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, She muſt determine nearly the ſize of the Rupture, and on what ſide it lies.</p>
               <p>FOURTHLY, She muſt ſet down preciſely its place, if in the groin or bending of the thigh.</p>
               <p>FIFTHLY, Whether or no it re-enters, and whether, in re-entring, it returns more difficultly in a ſtanding than lying poſture.</p>
               <p>SIXTHLY, When the Rupture is in the bending of the groin, it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh whether it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends as low as the ſide of the natural parts.</p>
               <p>SEVENTHLY, If it is in the bending of the thigh, it is neceſſary to ſpecify, whether it be round or long.</p>
               <p>EIGHTHLY, If there are two Ruptures, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to hint which is the biggeſt.</p>
               <p>NINTHLY, It muſt be remarked, whether the perſon be fat or thin, or only in a tolerable good plight, of body.</p>
               <p>TENTHLY, It muſt be hinted, whether the patient has one hip bigger than the other, which is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſe; or if there be any other deformity, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0010503100:45"/>not to fail deſcribing it, and ſetting down its place with ink upon the meaſure.</p>
               <p>To this memorial the patient may add the meaſure of her body, taken with a ſlip of paper of a proper length. Whether the Rupture be ſingle or double, in the groin, or bending of the thigh, it is ſufficient to lay the middle of the ſlip of paper immediately over the part where the clift of the breech ends, and to join the two ends of the paper above the place where the top of the natural parts re-unite.</p>
               <p>If the rupture be in the navel, in the ſame manner will be taken the ſize of the belly, by laying the middle of the ſlip of paper on the part of the back which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to thoſe of the ſides, which are between the ribs and the bones of the hips, and by joining the two ends of the paper over-againſt the part where the middle of the paper has been laid behind the back; if the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be preciſely at the meeting of the two ends of the ſlip of paper, that muſt needs be ſpecified in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial; if not, it is neceſſary to mark exactly at what diſtance from this meeting of the two ends of the ſlip the Rapture lies, whether a quarter of an inch, half an inch, or one or two inches above or below.</p>
               <p>Care alſo may be taken to ſpecify in the memorial, <hi>1mo.</hi> The part of the navel the Rupture occupies, either the middle or its circumference, either lies above or below it, or to one ſide. <hi>2do,</hi> If it is of an old or recent ſtanding. <hi>3tio,</hi> Its ſize. <hi>4to,</hi> Its ſhape. <hi>5to,</hi> If it re-enters or not. <hi>6to,</hi> If the navel be higher or lower than the bone of the hips. <hi>7mo,</hi> If the belly be hard or very ſoft; 'tis moreover neceſſary to know, whether the patient has had children, and how many.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0010503100:46"/>
               <p>All thoſe particulars are very neceſſary to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in order to execute with care the truſſes proper in each of theſe circumſtances, and render them as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious as uſeful, when the patients oh their part ſhall uſe the neceſſary care in their juſt application: On this head I am to preſcribe ſome rules in the following chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> On the manner of putting on the truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; neceſſary precautions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, previous to the laying or adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</head>
               <p>THE truſs would become abſolutely unſerviceable, if improperly adjuſted. It is, therefore, of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the patients, to have rules to follow for their juſt application. Theſe rules are the ſame for perſons of what age ſoever, even for children at the breaſt.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the truſs is to ſtop the hole, at which the rupture comes out, in order to prevent its coming out; we muſt for that purpoſe begin with reducing it back into the belly.</p>
               <p>The Ruptures, unaccompanied with ſymptoms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter with facility enough of themſelves, when the patients are abed; of conſequence, the morning, at the hour of waking, is the time to apply the truſs. To do it with eaſe, of what nature ſoever, or in what part ſoever the Rupture be, we paſs the girdle below the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0010503100:47"/>back, and approach with one hand the cuſhion of the truſs over-againſt the part of the Rupture; with the other we examine whether any thing remains out of the belly; afterwards, laying hold with this laſt hand on the girdle of the truſs, we pull it to ourſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cuſhion, whilſt with the other we fix the cuſhion directly upon the part where the Rupture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before reduction: We at the ſame time faſten the girdle to the hook, which is on the outſide of the cuſhion.</p>
               <p>To procure the proper poſition to the truſs, the lower border of the girdle ſhould be behind the back, immediately above the clift of the breech. When we are ſure it has gained its due poſition, we muſt then tighten it ſufficiently: For this purpoſe we lay hold on the girdle with one hand, at the part where it joins to the iron-work of the truſs, and we pull it ſucceſſively by ſlipping the hand as far as to its extremity; while with the other hand we hold the cuſhion ſteady on the part where it ſhould be placed; if it were not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, it would ſhift to one ſide of the thigh, and no longer be found on the hole of the Rupture. It is not neceſſary that the truſs be too ſlack, and neither muſt it be too right. You will obſerve to tighten it from time to time; fat people ſhould particularly mind this, becauſe the longer they uſe the truſs, the fat ſinks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the girdle, which of conſequence becomes too ſlack; which is the reaſon that the over-ſlackening of the girdle is charged on its lengthening: And it alſo happens that the girdle of the truſs is found hid by the pads which the fat forms both above and below, when the fat has been entirely flattened under the girdle by its reiterated compreſſions.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0010503100:48"/>
               <p>Almoſt all the patients have the cuſtom of placing the cuſhion of their truſs too low, eſpecially ſuch whoſe Ruptures fall down pretty low, without conſidering, that the buſineſs is only to ſtop the hole, to prevent the parts from coming out; for when the cuſhion is placed ſo low, the hole remaining unſtopped, the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes out above the cuſhion of the truſs.</p>
               <p>When the patients are thin, the truſs fails not to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, eſpecially when they are abed: In this caſe we muſt uſe a ſmall ſtrap, which is fixed to the truſs; we paſs it under the thigh, and faſten it to the iron-hook, which ſerves to fix the girdle; but we muſt obſerve, that it ought to be put under the leather of the girdle, as otherwiſe it would be always apt to looſen.</p>
               <p>When there is a neceſſity of wearing the truſs of nights, we muſt take care to adjuſt or put it in order before we get out of bed of a morning, and as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we give ourſelves lower or raiſe it behind, we muſt not fail replacing it in its due poſition, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the cuſhion would not bear exactly upon the hole.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to children who are not cleanly, we muſt be careful of ſhifting their truſſes every day, to prevent the ordure from heating or fretting them.</p>
               <p>In plump fat children, the girdle ſhould behind be a good finger's breadth above the clift of the breech; in the thin, it ſhould immediately touch the clift, or even be a little lower.</p>
               <p>We muſt be ever cautious in ſhifting their truſs, that the Rupture does not fall out again; for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we muſt have ready at hand that which is to replace the other, and lay the finger on the hole, till the ſecond truſs is adjuſted.</p>

               <p>BY radical cure we mean ſuch as removes a diſeaſe to its very root. The radical cure of Ruptures is, therefore, that, by means of which we may cure theſe diſorders, without apprehenſion of any return. Is this poſſible? 'Tis what may be eaſily proved.</p>
               <p>But as I ſhould be obliged to tranſcribe word for word what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has at large to ſo good purpoſe writ on this ſubject, ſuch as would ſatisfy themſelves of this truth may conſult the book of that author, chap. xiv. ſect. ii. part i.</p>
               <p>All I can ſay to prevail on the patients not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be diſcouraged, as commonly thoſe are, who are afflicted with theſe diſorders, is, that there are none for which there is a greater variety of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies known. The only queſtion is to know how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate them to the conſtitutions of the patients, their age, their ſex, the climates they inhabit, and to know how to diſtinguiſh the ſpecies of Ruptures which are curable from thoſe which are incurable. 'Tis with theſe infirmities as with all the others; ſuch a one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured by a remedy, which ten or a ſcore others have found the good effects of, becauſe the circumſtances differ. This is the reaſon, why the remedies of the good women do ſometimes much good, and very often a great deal of harm.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Ruptures of the womb, otherwiſe called the inverſion of the womb, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the womb, falling of the womb; the relaxation and inverſion of the vagina.</head>
               <p>WHAT THE WOMB IS. THE womb is the principal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of generation, it is ſituated between the bladder and ſtreight gut. The womb is of the ſhape of a pocket-flaſk; it is divided into two parts; the one called the neck, the other the body of the womb: Its neck is terminated by an opening, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the orifice; it anſwers to the bottom of the vagina; its body is the largeſt part; it is ſeated in the lower bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beyond the vagina, ſo that we can only reach to the neck of the womb, when we introduce the finger into the part.</p>
               <p>The womb is hollow within, and kept in its place by four ligaments; two called the broad, and two the round.</p>
               <p>'Tis theſe ligaments we are principally to regard, in order to form a juſt idea of the Ruptures of the womb: Theſe ligaments are capable of an extraordinary degree of extenſion; otherwiſe the womb could not place itſelf in the belly, by ſtretching in the time of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy; but would continue in its natural place, and be there ſtraitned and confined.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0010503100:51"/>
               <p>The broad ligaments cover all the exterior bottom of the womb. They are there firmly attached; they riſe on each ſide, and ſtretch, by enlarging, to proceed to faſten on the parts which cover the hip bones inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: 'Tis a ſort of very ſtrong membrane.</p>
               <p>The round ligaments are ſo called from their round figure like a cord; they are as big as the quill of a raven; of a nature reſembling that of the broad ligaments; for they are properly only a diviſion of them; they come out of the belly at the holes which are in the groin, by which the Ruptures of the groin happen; they proceed to faſten themſelves to the bone of the thigh. The womb is kept in place by theſe four ligaments.</p>
               <p>The vagina is a canal, conſiſting of a very thick membrane, capable of dilating and contracting; this canal ſerves for an emunctory or drain to the flowings from the womb.</p>
               <p>INVERSION OF THE WOMB. The womb being the principal organ of generation, it ſometimes happens, that in child bearing the inſide of this comes out at its opening or orifice, in the manner as turning a purſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide out; this diſorder has, beſides, other cauſes; but theſe very rare. The being over-fat is one in particular. This diſtemper is ſo diſtinctly handled in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s book, chap xxiv. ſect. ii. p. 1. that I thither refer ſuch as would be further informed about it: I could only copy this author, and that would be to diſguſt him.</p>
               <p>RELAXATION OF THE WOMB. Tho' the term re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the womb be improper, I ſhall however make uſe of it, becauſe all authors do ſo: For it is not the womb that relaxes; 'tis its ligaments, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0010503100:52"/>lengthening, ſuffer the womb to quit its natural place, and thus to fall down more or leſs into the vagina.</p>
               <p>When the ligaments are only relaxed to a certain pitch, this is what is properly called the relaxation of the womb, becauſe it is come down lower than the place it naturally occupies, but comes not out of the vagina.</p>
               <p>FALLING OP THE WOMB. When the womb comes out at the vagina, then that ſpecies of Rupture is called the falling of the womb: This diſorder may be more or leſs conſiderable, according as it comes out more or leſs; there are ſome, in whom, for want of mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, it hangs down as low as the middle of the thighs, and then it grows in bigneſs to a pitch as ſometimes to become as big as the head of a child.</p>
               <p>RELAXATION OF THE VAGINA. The vagina re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes too, and that either in part or in whole; if in part only, the diſorder is called, the relaxation of the vagina; if in whole, the inverſion of the vagina; then it forms an eminence, which comes out of the natural parts.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The general and particular cauſes of theſe diſorders are the ſame with thoſe contributing to form the other Ruptures; of conſequence young women are ſubject to them. 'Tis true they are not ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, as the married; but there are ſome in whom the womb falls, and the vagina relaxes to the higheſt pitch.</p>
               <p>Married women are more ſubject to them, becauſe in pregnancy the ligaments of the womb are extremely lengthened, by the weight of the child it contains: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe who are not tender enough of themſelves, after delivery, by keeping at reſt and not ſtirring, are more ſubject to theſe infirmities than others.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0010503100:53"/>
               <p>SYMPTOMS. The ſymptoms of theſe diſorders differ according to the caſe. When there is only a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of die womb, the patients feel ſome pain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the loins, and at the top of the thighs. They walk with leſs facility, and are never better than when ſitting, or abed.</p>
               <p>When the womb comes out a little at the vagina, beſides what I have juſt ſaid, the patient has a deſire to make water often, or a difficulty in making it.</p>
               <p>When the womb is in whole come out, it is expoſed to the rubbing of the thighs, and to receive the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the urine, which runs upon it in making wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which cauſes it to ſmart, occaſions painful excori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and conſiderable ulcers.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſymptoms are followed by thoſe which attack the womb itſelf; it is inflated and hardened, and then it is very difficult to effect its return.</p>
               <p>The ſymptoms which accompany the relaxation of the vagina and its inverſion, are not ſo conſiderable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when it carries along with it the womb; for then the patients feel the ſame pains in the loins and thighs as in the falling of the womb. But, in the ſimple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the vagina, there is no pain.</p>
               <p>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. Theſe diſorders are known by the ſymptoms I have juſt mentioned, excepting the ſimple relaxation of the vagina, which can only be known by a ſort of ſwelling or inflation, felt at its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
               <p>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. In theſe four diſorders, the relaxation and inverſion of the vagina are the moſt difficult to cure, tho' without any danger to life; the relaxation, or falling of the womb, juſt beginning,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0010503100:54"/>is eaſily enough cured, when the diſtemper is not of an old ſtanding: It even happens ſometimes, that after a new pregnancy, if the patient be tender of herſelf in her lying-in, and keep her bed cloſe, ſhe is cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the aid of any remedies.</p>
               <p>But the grand ſymptoms to which the womb is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when it comes out entirely, are ſufficient to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the danger, and the difficulty there is to cure the patients.</p>
               <p>CURE. The relaxations and failing of the womb, the relaxations and inverſions of the vagina, are ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, as the other ſpecies of Ruptures, of a twofold cure, the radical and the palliative.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not engage in the detail of the firſt, that would carry me too far, and I could hot abridge it, without omitting things too neceſſary; it may be ſeen in chap. xxv and xxvi. ſect. ii. P. I. of Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud's</hi> work.</p>
               <p>The palliative cure, which is the moſt uſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in keeping in place the relaxed or diſplaced parts by the means of peſſaries.</p>
               <p>Peſſaries are inſtruments which ſerve to keep the womb and the vagina in place, and to hinder their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting too much from their natural ſtate. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of theſe machines, which are made in different forms and ſhapes, according to the notions of him who applies them, or the nature of the malady, has inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies ſo conſiderable, that the advantage derived from them is worſe than the diſeaſe itſelf; beſides, that we are obliged to introduce them into the part with violence, and keep them there without ſcarce ever removing them; theſe peſſaries are always made either of matters ſubject to corruption, as cork and wood; or incorruptible, as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0010503100:55"/>gold of ivory, which hurt the womb or the vagina; this cauſes a flow of matter extremely fetid, with which the patients themſelves are always offended, and often thoſe who approach them.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons have put Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> on contriving a ſort of peſſaries, with all the advantages we can deſire, and without any of the inconveniencies of the others. It is the only peſſary I would adviſe patients to uſe, and whoſe deſcription is very clearly given in that author's book chap. xxvii. ſect. ii. P. I.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the relaxation of the fundament.</head>
               <p>WHAT THE FUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAMENT IS. THE fundament is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the guts, which terminate in a round opening, with a power to open and cloſe. Its uſe is to allow the diſcharge of the excrements and wind out of the belly.</p>
               <p>The extremity of the gut, which ends at the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ſometimes relaxed; and comes out by turning itſelf, juſt like the finger of a glove, when we pull the glove by turning it.</p>
               <p>This malady happens very commonly to children; women are alſo ſubject to it ſometimes.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The cauſe of this relaxation conſiſts for the moſt part in the too great quantity of ſeroſities, which water this part; the palſy of the muſcles of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contributes ſometimes too.</p>
               <p>But ſtrainings determine this diſtemper; as crying in children, conſtipation in perſons in years, and the effort exerted in child-bearing.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0010503100:56"/>
               <p>SYMPTOMS. It is rare that this, malady is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with untoward ſymptoms; being ſo incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, people never put off the looking out for the proper aid. But were the procuring the return of the gut neglected, an inflammation would be formed in it, and a gangrene might ſeize upon it, which would expoſe the patients to a very great riſk.</p>
               <p>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. This diſtemper is known by the eminence or lengthening formed by the gut of the fundament.</p>
               <p>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. According to what we have juſt ſeen of the ſymptoms of this diſtemper, it is eaſy to judge, that it is dangerous, when neglected.</p>
               <p>CURE. We remedy this diſtemper by procuring the return of the gut, and retaining it, when returned; or by employing the remedies proper to fortify and ſtrengthen it. All theſe means are recited in chap. xxviii. of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s book.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of falſe hernia's.</head>
               <p>IT now remains to ſpeak of falſe hernia's. Theſe diſtempers are ſo rare in the ſex, that I might well paſs them over in ſilence; yet as I have ſeen ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that they were taken for Ruptures; I think it not from the purpoſe to give a general notion of them.</p>
               <p>WHAT A FALSE HERNIA IS. We underſtand by falſe hernias, tumours that happen in the parts where the true Ruptures are formed; they are called falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they impoſe upon us, by giving room to think them true Ruptures, unleſs we carefully conſider them.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0010503100:57"/>
               <p>DIFFERENCES. There are two ſpecies of them; ſome conſiſt of water; theſe are called hydroceles; others, of fleſh, or thick, hard, and viſcid humours; theſe are called extraneous bodies.</p>
               <p>The hydroceles ſometimes ſhew themſelves in the bendings of the thighs, in the groin, and in the lips of the natural parts; there may be formed of them two in the navel.</p>
               <p>The extraneous bodies are formed at the entrance of the vagina, and in its cavity; ſometimes alſo they are attached to the neck of the womb.</p>
               <p>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The falſe hernias are known by the impoſſibility there is of procuring their return; to the difference of true Ruptures, which return eaſily to the belly, or at leaſt have returned before they have got adheſions, or are become of enormous bulk; but hydroceles, how ſmall and recent ſoever they be, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return.</p>
               <p>It is the ſame as to extraneous bodies, theſe return not; but they are diſtinguiſhed from hydroceles, as they are quite apart and ſeparate from the parts to which they are attached; hydroceles, on the contrary, unite with the parts where they grow.</p>
               <p>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. We may ſay, that theſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers are attended with no uneaſineſs; they are rather incommodious than dangerous.</p>
               <p>CURE. Hydroceles are cured by tapping, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing them by reſolvents; they are, beſides, cured by compreſſions, by the means of ſome proper bandages or truſſes.</p>
               <p>As to extraneous bodies, theſe are deſtroyed by liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or inciſion.</p>
