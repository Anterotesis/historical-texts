            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Widow,</hi> you know, was a good ſort of a Woman; ſhe was Pious and Charitable, and did a great deal of Good among her poor Neighbours: Went conſtantly to the Pariſh-Church on <hi>Sundays,</hi> and in general had the Character of a conſcientious motherly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>Her Husband, whilſt he lived, was one of the honeſteſt Men breathing: 'Tis true he would take his Glaſs in Company, as all his Countrymen will do: But he was a downright honeſt Fellow, and lov'd the Town; and we ſhall never forget how tightly he ſtood by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0642501000:3"/>
he lived, and the whole Country was heartily ſorry for his Death, having not left an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter Man behind him in the <hi>Pariſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what need I tell you things which you are as well acquainted with as my ſelf, only to refreſh your Memory in ſome <hi>Paſſages</hi> previous to your Requeſt? You deſire to know the Diſpoſition of the Eſtate, and how the <hi>Three Farms</hi> ſtand affected at this Day.</p>
            <p>You remember at her firſt coming to the Houſe, ſhe found the Debts of an old <hi>Law-Suit</hi> to be paid, which had laſted long, and a new one juſt ready to begin, which no body could gueſs the Event of. Money there was little or none in the Houſe; and only a few <hi>Exchequer</hi> Notes, which no body but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeman would take for Ready Money.</p>
            <p>Her <hi>Tenants</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomers</hi> were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſee her ruined; and as ſhe had treated them very handſomly at her <hi>Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warming,</hi> they ſwore they would ſtand by her againſt all Oppoſers. By Oppoſers you know who they meant: For it was by this time certainly known, that old <hi rend="blackletterType">Savage,</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner, had ſet up a <hi>Competitor</hi> againſt her, <hi>Pretending</hi> he was a real <hi>Branch</hi> of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Family of the <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute</hi>'s, formerly Lords of the <hi>MANOR,</hi> and brought a Writ of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectment in his Name, and fee'd Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Widow. This <hi rend="blackletterType">Savage</hi> is one who has always made it his buſineſs to entertain Renegadoes and Impoſtors; and by forged Deeds and Wills to take Poſſeſſion of Eſtates,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0642501000:4"/>
and then maintain them by trouble ſome Law Suits; till at laſt he has ſhared a handſome Compoſition for himſelf. You cannot chuſe too but know, that both by <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Gift,</hi> the Houſe it ſelf as well as the <hi>Three Farms</hi> had been ſettled on her near <hi>Kinſman</hi> Mr. WRIGHT, (a Man whom all the honeſt <hi>Tenants</hi> wiſhed to ſucceed her) as well in her Life, as in the time of her <hi>Predeceſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be ſhort (as you muſt needs know) a hazardous <hi>Suit</hi> commenced; and becauſe it ſhould not lye too hard upon the Widow, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her Friends became Parties to it. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>John Truſty,</hi> by general Conſent was made chief Agent in the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> who the firſt <hi>Term</hi> put the <hi>Widow</hi>'s Affairs in a good Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and for ſeveral <hi>Terms</hi> following was continually gaining one Advantage or other over her Adverſaries; ſo that they began now to ſue for <hi>Compoſition,</hi> and a Meeting was appointed on both ſides, but refuſing to allow ſufficient Coſts and Damages, the <hi>Law</hi> went on.</p>
            <p>In this promiſing State ſtood Affairs, when that furious <hi>Pulpiteer,</hi> the <hi>Curate</hi> of <hi>High-Ham,</hi> came to preach at <hi>Hockley,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pack'd up a Sermon for the purpoſe, he infus'd Sedition among the <hi>Widow</hi>'s <hi>Tenants</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomers,</hi> inſinuating that ſhe began to ſell in <hi>ſhort Meaſure,</hi> Brew'd with <hi>Home-made Malt,</hi> and let her <hi>Lawyers, Book-keepers, Oſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Chamberlain, Tapſter, &amp;c.</hi> run away with what ſhould pay the <hi>Exciſe.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0642501000:5"/>
vehemently againſt the <hi>Parſon of the Pariſh,</hi> and other <hi>Heads</hi> of tke Town, for not repairing the CHURCH, one part of which he ſaid was <hi>damaged</hi> and ready to <hi>fall;</hi> whilſt the <hi>Conventicle</hi> was upheld by ſome about her, and a Parcel of <hi>GYPSIES</hi> kept privately in the <hi>Barn</hi> to eat her out of Houſe and Home.</p>
            <p>The Fellow had a good Talent at Railing, and could run on with as much Impudence as a Mountebank exhibits his Pacquet: In ſhort the Poiſon worked ſo ſubtly, that the whole Country was put in a Ferment. The Curate was taken up, and brought before the <hi>Bench of Juſtices;</hi> where tho' he was repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and ordered to find Sureties for his <hi>Good Behaviour</hi> for 3 Years, yet it did not quiet the People, who cry'd out, <hi>The Church, the Church!</hi> and ran up and down in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, as tho' it had been falling on their Heads; whilſt to ſtrengthen the matter, the <hi>Curate</hi> took a <hi>Journey</hi> round the Country, poſſeſſing the People that the <hi>Houſe</hi> was haunted, and bid them take care how they came near it any more, directing them to the <hi rend="blackletterType">Pope</hi>'s <hi rend="blackletterType">Head</hi> and <hi rend="blackletterType">Dagger,</hi> near the <hi rend="blackletterType">Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time one <hi>Robin Sly-boots,</hi> a <hi>Welch Button-maker,</hi> a notorious cunning Fellow, and fam'd for a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> who had formerly belonged to the Family, but was turned out, for making too bold with the <hi>Widow</hi>'s Secrets. This Fellow took his Opportunity to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt one of the <hi>Widow</hi>'s Maids, by pretending
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0642501000:6"/>
to tell her her Fortune, which ſuch gigling Wenches are generally fond of; ſo that taking her one Day, as ſhe was ſweeping the Rooms, and making the Beds, he began in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Nab,</hi> ſays he, I have often taken notice that thou art a Pains-taking, induſtrious Girl, and haſt lived a great while in thy Service without coming to any Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Tis true, you ſweep the Rooms, make the Beds, and get a little ſorry Vails of the <hi>Gueſts,</hi> but 'tis Mrs. <hi>Sarah</hi> runs away with all the Profit, and keeps her whole Family at your Miſtreſſes charge. But tho' ſhe now flouts the <hi>Widow,</hi> and flies and bounces like bottled Ale, thou ſhalt one day, if thou tak'ſt my Advice, come to be as high as ſhe: Remember it, <hi>Nab,</hi> I ſay, thou ſhalt come to be a Lady."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Bleſs me, ſays <hi>Nab,</hi> (with a ſimpering Countenance, knowing he had long had the Reputation of a Conjurer) is it poſſible that I ſhould come to ſuch Preferment as you ſay? That you may believe me, ſays <hi>Robin,</hi> go preſently, and look on the Bed in the <hi>Green Room,</hi> there lies a <hi>Calicoe Gown</hi> and <hi>Peticoat,</hi> lin'd thro' with the ſame; ask your Miſtreſs for it, and ſhe will give it you. As you find this true, believe me in the reſt."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nab,</hi> no longer able to contain her ſelf flung down her Beſom, and ran to the place, where finding it as he had ſaid, ſhe returned overjoyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0642501000:7"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"But, Mr: <hi>Slyboots,</hi> ſays <hi>Nab,</hi> how is this thing to be effected? I'll tell you, ſays <hi>Robin,</hi>—At Midnight, when all things are quiet, you ſhall plant me in ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and for the greater Solemnity I will have my <hi>Conjurers Gown</hi> on. You muſt on your part infuſe ſtrange things into her Head, and tell her as many <hi>Tales</hi> as you can of the Servants. Then bring in ſome talk of the <hi>Curate;</hi> tell her what a good Man he is, and that he had always a great Reſpect for her; inſinuate that the Deſign of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him before the <hi>Bench of Juſtices</hi> was to diſgrace the <hi>Church;</hi> and that thoſe who were his Friends, ſhe may aſſure her ſelf are hers; and whilſt ſhe is muſing on theſe things, for I know it will work on her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Spirit, I will appear, and then leave the reſt to me."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nab,</hi> in the mean time, had got the <hi>Gown</hi> and <hi>Peticoat</hi> which <hi>Robin</hi> ſpoke of, and was pretty ſure the reſt of his <hi>Predictions</hi> would follow. In fine, the <hi>Widow</hi> was ſo poſſeſſed and deluded by <hi>Nab</hi>'s whining, and this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring</hi> Raſcal's Cant, that, tho' otherwiſe a Woman of Senſe, ſhe grew perfectly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd, ſo that without examining farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, giving Ear to <hi>Nab</hi>'s Tales, ſhe preſently began to Reform her Family; and a great many of the honeſteſt <hi>Tenants</hi> had warning given them againſt the next Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-day. However the <hi>Law-Suit</hi> continuing, they did not yet think fit to turn out honeſt

               <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Agent,</hi> becauſe the taking the <hi>Papers</hi> out of his Hands might be dangerous to the <hi>CAUSE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the reſt, to make room for <hi>Robin, Ralph</hi> the <hi>Caſh-keeper</hi> was diſmiſſed, a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right honeſt Fellow, and had held his Place long with great Integrity, tho' many of her beſt <hi>Cuſtomers</hi> told her they would leave the Houſe, and ſtand by her no longer, if ſhe took theſe Courſes. But all did not avail; every thing went as <hi>Robin</hi> adviſed; in fine, ſhe turn'd away all her old honeſt Servants, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the <hi>Club</hi> that was kept at her Houſe, and none were held in favour, but ſuch as had appeared to be Friends to the <hi>Curate,</hi> or were <hi>Robin</hi>'s Creatures. <hi>Robin</hi> was firſt made <hi>Book-keeper</hi> and <hi>Under-Caſh-keeper,</hi> and after <hi>Head-Caſh-keeper,</hi> which was what he all along aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at. He grew angry now at being called plain <hi>Robin,</hi> and nothing would go down but Mr. <hi>Slyboots</hi> at every word. He changed his Sign, which was before the <hi>Three Button-moles,</hi> and hung up in the room of it the <hi>Star</hi> and <hi>Garter</hi> finely painted, and had Vanity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence enough to take the two <hi>Angels</hi> for <hi>Supporters</hi> to his <hi>Sign-Poſt.</hi> All that he ſaid or did, if it may bear an old Pun, was <hi>Bob as a Robin;</hi> he brought in all his Friends, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as poor as <hi>Howlets,</hi> to rule the Roaſt, and fill their hungry Bellies at the Widow's Table; ſuch an avaritious Crew as were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth hanging; a Medley of <hi>Welch Crate-Carriers, Pedlars,</hi> Retalers of <hi>Hob-nails, Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0642501000:9"/>
&amp;c. and among the reſt advanced <hi>Harry Aucumy,</hi> the Brazier, an audacious, lewd young Fellow, to be one of the <hi>Clerks of the Brew-houſe.</hi> This was a docible young Dog for <hi>Robin</hi>'s Purpoſe, and by a pert way of ſpeaking in the <hi>Club,</hi> dexterouſly advanc'd the Reputation of <hi>Robin</hi>'s Proceedings. In ſhort, all went ſwimmingly in the <hi>INN</hi> for a Year or two, and the Rogues with thriving Faces, careſſed one another in their Iniquity.</p>
            <p>But they found the <hi>Law-Suit</hi> began to hang heavy on their Hands; they had not the ſame Credit that the former Servants had to borrow Money, and they had none of their own to lend: The <hi>Rino</hi> was wanted to pay Fees, and the <hi>Tenants</hi> were very backward to advance more; ſo that finding they were like to bring an old Houſe upon their Heads if they went on, they were reſolved at any rate to come to an Accommodation; and <hi>Harry Aucumy</hi> was ſent privately to old <hi rend="blackletterType">Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage</hi>'s Houſe to treat about it, tho' they had ſtill told the <hi>Tenants</hi> it ſhould be puſh'd on <hi>vigorouſly</hi> next <hi>Term,</hi> and conſtantly got Money out of them for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Thinking their Buſineſs was now done, they put honeſt <hi>John Truſty</hi> out of the Agency, and like a Parcel of ungrateful Curs, ſet their Black Guard to pelt him; but the honeſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Town could not forbear expreſſing their Love in reſpect to his upright and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dealing, by welcoming him Home with loud Acclamations, which fretted the Rogues

to the Plucks to ſee him ſo careſſed, by whoſe good <hi>Management</hi> the <hi>Cauſe</hi> had been brought to that Iſſue, that <hi>Judgment</hi> was order'd to be enter'd up, and <hi>Execution</hi> would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have follow'd the very next <hi>Term.</hi> It will be tedious to relate all the intricate Paſſages of the Law, and how the Widow's Friends reſolv'd to carry the Cauſe on without her, but that <hi>Robin</hi> had ordered the new <hi>Agent Jacob Ruſh</hi> to ſtifle many of the chief Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, by which the Adverſary's Attorney found means to ſtop Judgment.</p>
            <p>To amuſe the <hi>Tenants,</hi> who they knew would be alarm'd at this Proceeding, it was given out, that the <hi>Widow</hi>'s <hi>Friends</hi> had not paid their ſhare of the <hi>Law-Charges,</hi> but that all the <hi>Burden</hi> had lain upon her, which had run her grievouſly in Debt, and that ſhe was in a manner forc'd to a Compoſition, and had Offers now of a very good one, much to the Advantage of her ſelf and her <hi>Friends.</hi> This took with the ſilly People, and in ſpight of all the Intreaties of her honeſt <hi>Tenants,</hi> an Agreement ſoon followed, which however had taken up more Time and Money to effect, than would have decided it at <hi>Common-Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true we burnt our Faggot-ſtacks, ſet the Bells a ringing, and illumined our Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, but we ſoon experienc'd, that Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have become us better. The Houſe loſt its Trade, and no body in Town almoſt had any thing to do. People began to ſee into this, when it was too late, and no Remedy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0642501000:11"/>
could be found to help them. Our <hi>old Friends</hi> exclaimed againſt us, as a treacherous and baſe ſort of People, and ſhun'd the Town, and our new ones apparently ſlighted us, tho' we had done them ſuch ſignal Service: Nor could we ſo much as obtain to have the <hi>Quarter-Seſſions</hi> kept here, tho' our Credit before uſed to draw every Body to us.</p>
            <p>They began to cavil now at the <hi>Widow</hi>'s Will in favour of Mr. WRIGHT, and tho' they durſt not openly declare themſelves, yet 'tis known they were endeavouring to invei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the People into an Opinion of young <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute</hi>'s Title, and diſpers'd <hi>Papers</hi> to prove it; nor did they uſe Mr. WRIGHT as tho' they ever expected he would come to the Eſtate. All we could do was to wiſh them hang'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould bring it to paſs; for you muſt know we hate the young Fellow hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily: His Father, Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> (if he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly begot) uſed us horribly, quarter'd Soldiers upon us, threaten'd our <hi>Charter,</hi> and play'd the Devil for God's ſake thro' the whole Country till we were fain to ſend him packing; and 'tis very well known the young Rogue will never forgive us for't.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Widow</hi> being to ſend one to old <hi rend="blackletterType">Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage</hi>'s to adjuſt Accounts on the Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who ſhould theſe <hi>Achitophels</hi> adviſe her to but <hi>Jacob Booty,</hi> a notorious Friend to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute</hi>'s. This put us in ſuch a Fright that we were ready to offer a Leg or Arm, out of every Family for Indemnity: For
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0642501000:12"/>
we ſuppoſed he could have no other <hi>Buſineſs</hi> but to ſtrike up a Bargain at old <hi rend="blackletterType">Savage</hi>'s; but as it happened we had the good Fortune to ſee him die in a Ditch before he ſet out, and ſave the H—n a labour, whoſe Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis ſaid, he had merited a few Years before by endeavouring to give the <hi>Young Gentleman</hi> Poſſeſſion of the <hi>North</hi> Farm, with deſign to burn and plunder it, if he could not hold it by Law.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, every Day produced freſh Inſtances of our Misfortunes, and of the Villanies of thoſe who had betray'd us: Old <hi rend="blackletterType">Savage,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had reduced to be as poor as a <hi>Church Mouſe,</hi> ſo that he lay even at our Mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bully us again, reſerving many of the Conditions of the Agreement unexecuted. He demoliſhed a <hi>Turn-pike</hi> upon the <hi>River,</hi> which had been a great Annoyance to our <hi>Trade,</hi> but fallaciouſly erected another a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle nearer home, and eluded the chief Article of the <hi>Accommodation;</hi> he promiſed to diſmiſs young <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute</hi> out of his Family, and with a mental Reſervation only ſent him to board with one of his Tenants at next Door. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he engaged to uſe his Intereſt with young <hi>Savage</hi> his Grandſon in behalf of ſome <hi>Poor People</hi> that lay at his Mercy on account of ſerving the <hi>Widow,</hi> who appear'd under a great concern for them, inſtead of which like an accompliſh'd <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> he ſent his <hi>Mirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> and <hi>Bayliffs</hi> to haul them to <hi>Execution.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0642501000:13"/>
Every thing was acted with the ſame Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and ſeem'd to be pulling on our Ruin, whilſt our <hi>Agents</hi> at home, out of the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, durſt not wag a Tongue, or a Finger againſt him, they lay ſo open and ſo expoſed by the Rogueries he was privy to. Ah poor <hi>Country!</hi> What could relieve thee but a Miracle? Or what animate thy Hopes, but the Interpoſition of <hi>Providence,</hi> that dear, that eternal Providence, which had reſcu'd thee in the like Caſes of imminent Danger? Would you believe it, Sir, that theſe <hi>Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rados</hi> having no other way to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were juſt entering into a Conſpiracy to undermine Mr. WRIGHT's Intereſt, and carry the Trade to the <hi rend="blackletterType">Pope</hi>'s-<hi rend="blackletterType">Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It could not be expected that Men aſſociated in Miſchief ſhould long agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which Maxim 'tis very probable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the old Proverb; <hi>When</hi> R—s <hi>and</hi> W—s <hi>fall out honeſt Men come by their Goods.</hi> You may apply it as you pleaſe; the uſe I ſhall make of it is only to tell you that the Houſe began to be divided againſt itſelf, and ſo could not ſtand long; <hi>Robin</hi> had now brought up a Bird to pick out his Eyes; his <hi>Pupil Harry</hi> had got the Start of him, and jock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed him out of the <hi>Widow</hi>'s Favour. <hi>Harry</hi> took up a Reſolution to ſpur at all, <hi>aut Caeſar aut nullus;</hi> but <hi>Robin,</hi> who had always a great Veneration for his Neck, was willing to jog on ſoberly; <hi>Harry,</hi> out of the Vivacity of his Temper, told him, he was a Fellow of no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0642501000:14"/>
and that his Cowardice quite baulk'd the Cauſe: Yes, ſays <hi>Robin,</hi> (very dryly) but it may be a means of ſaving your Neck, if you take Example by it, and act with a little more Deliberation and Gravity. This in the end came to an open Rupture, ſo that one Day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt they fell to it Pel mel before the <hi>Widow. Robin</hi> among other things charged him with Ingratitude, and told him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He took him up an idle, looſe, young Fellow, ſtragling about the Town, when he had hardly nine Pence in his Pocket to go to a Whore withal; that he brought him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted at the Widow's, and put him into Buſineſs he might live handſomely upon, if he had the Grace to follow it; but that it was plain he was as looſe as ever, and his Management would be the Ruin of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, if he went on as he begun."</q> 
               <hi>Harry</hi> juſtly fired at this Language, call'd him <hi>muddy-headed Fellow,</hi> and ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If it had not been for him, his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> might have made a more advantageous <hi>Compoſition.</hi>"</q>
               <hi> Robin,</hi> in return to that, upbraided him with his hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd Negotiations, and that he ſuffer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be made drunk, and over-reach'd at old <hi rend="blackletterType">Savage</hi>'s, where, ſays he, unleſs your <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view</hi> with young <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute</hi> (for which I hope to ſee you hang'd,) a few fine Congees, and two or three lewd <hi>Intrigues,</hi> the reſt was owing to your Companion <hi>Matt.</hi> the <hi>Tavern Boy,</hi> who was fain to carry Brains for his Maſter. <hi>Harry</hi> could hardly contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0642501000:15"/>
but with a very cloudy Brow told him, he had neither Brains nor any other Merit to raiſe him above the Character of a <hi>Trickſter:</hi> We know now, ſays he, why none but <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin Tom</hi> could be truſted at Mr. WRIGHT's; but thou waſt ever a trimming, equivocal Raſcal, and woo't ſo continue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sim</hi> the <hi>Scrivener</hi> put in a word on the ſame ſide, whom <hi>Robin</hi> took up very ſmartly. As for your part, ſays <hi>Robin,</hi> did I not raiſe you from a <hi>Petifogger</hi> to be <hi>what you are, took you from writing hackney up and down, lent you Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to pay your Debts, and help'd you to live like a Man, and you to conſpire againſt me too: But by</hi> Jove, rapping his Knuckles upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>I'll make you all as poor and beggarly as I found you!</hi> Thou wert always a Trickſter, reply'd <hi>Sim. I hated you before, but now I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe you. Nab.</hi> too open'd her Quail pipe at <hi>Robin,</hi> but what ſhe ſaid is not recorded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Widow</hi> heard all this with a Mixture of Grief and Surprize; but above all ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to hear them talk of a better <hi>Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> when ſhe had all along been told, <hi>it was a very good one;</hi> ſhe plainly perceived now ſhe had been trick'd, eſpecially by <hi>Robin,</hi> who ſhe declar'd, <hi>had not told her one word of truth from the beginning;</hi> ſo that <hi>Harry</hi> for the preſent ſeem'd to carry his <hi>Point. Robin</hi> was order'd to deliver up his Books, which were ſoon after given to the <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> one of the honeſteſt Servants in the Family, which partly ſhew'd the Widow's good Diſpoſition;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0642501000:16"/>
for as he was known to be very well affected to Mr. WRIGHT's Title, it ſhewed her own Inclination thereto, by pitching on a Perſon ſo very acceptable. This rejoic'd People ſtrangely, and the more, becauſe there had paſſed a current Rumour for ſome time, that they had been tampering with her to transfer the Eſtate to young <hi rend="blackletterType">Shute,</hi> after her Deceaſe, contrary to Law. How true it is, God knows; but it ſeems they were diſappointed. And I can aſſure you ſhe told ſome of her Friends, that ſhe had often repented the diſmiſſing her old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who had ſerved her faithfully, and given Content to her Cuſtomers; and if it pleaſed God to grant her Life and Health, ſhe would make a very great <hi>Alteration</hi> in Affairs.</p>
            <p>But in ſhort, what thro' the Grief and Fright ſhe had conceiv'd at their unmannerly Behaviour before her, and the Anguiſh of a former Diſtemper, it threw the Pain into her Head with ſuch Violence, that it ſoon put an end to her Life, for which the whole Town ſhew'd a general Concern, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her as a pious, good, and charitable Woman, whom it may be truly ſaid, <hi>they brought with Sorrow to the Grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately after ſhe expir'd, the <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees</hi> took Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Premiſes</hi> in Mr. WRIGHT's Name. I cannot deſcribe the infinite Joy on this Occaſion, and that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Satisfaction that appear'd in People's
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0642501000:17"/>
Countenances: All was acted with that Calmneſs and Unanimity, that Cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Alacrity, as ſeemed plainly to prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate our future Good: No one was wanting to do his part; nay, even the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Pariſh,</hi> tho' crazy with Age and Infirmities, yet appear'd abroad that Day to countenance Mr. WRIGHT's Title, being one of the <hi>Feofees</hi> in <hi>Truſt</hi> for him.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Harry Aucumy,</hi> indeed, appear'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very deep Preſſure of Mind; not ſo much for the Loſs of the <hi>Widow,</hi> as the ſole Power and Grandeur he conceiv'd himſelf fallen from, and the Inconveniences his paſt Conduct might bring him into; for he knew in his Conſcience he ſhould find it a difficult Matter to acquit himſelf honeſtly to Mr. WRIGHT. This occaſion'd a viſible Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his Countenance, and poor <hi>Harry</hi> looked as queer and dejected as one of the Vulgar. He put himſelf in cloſe <hi>Mourning,</hi> and exploded all Lewdneſs for nine Days, which you know is the ultimate Date of all Wonders, eſpecially with <hi>Harry. John Squeamiſh,</hi> the Head-Tapſter, a queer inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Fellow of <hi>Bob</hi>'s preferring; <hi>Sam.

We expect our new <hi>Landlord</hi> with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Impatience; and then you ſhall have a farther Account of what happens; aſſuring you, that this leaves us under the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Aſpect of having our Affairs retriev'd again from the languiſhing Condition the laſt three Years had thrown them into; and perhaps you never ſaw a more viſible Spirit of Joy than appears at preſent.</p>
