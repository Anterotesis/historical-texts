            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F any Thing in this World, be worthy of a wiſe Man's Care, it is Health; and as Mankind, cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teſtify their Gratitude to thoſe, who labour in the Practice
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0246501100:5"/>of healing Diſeaſes, with Diligence, Candour, and Judgment; ſo on the other hand, they cannot enough deteſt thoſe who ſet up for the <hi>Art of Healing,</hi> without any other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, but their <hi>Diploma,</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them; and having nothing in their view, but making or mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Fortunes, neglect that Knowledge, which is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to make their Practice Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Succeſsful.</p>
            <p>They who write Well and Ill, on the Subject of Health, ought in like-manner, to be ſet in oppoſition to one another, and as their Labours tend to the Preſervation or Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Health, ſo ought they to become the Objects of our Favour, or Contempt.</p>
            <p>As all Mankind, are more or leſs frail, they therefore ought to bear a great deal from one anothers Folly; and the trade of Scribling, among the reſt of Men's folly's, may be ſo far indulged, as not to be cenſured, ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0246501100:6"/>long as it continues harmeleſs and innocent; but as ſoon as it ceaſes to be ſo, it is every reaſonable Man's duty, to endeavour to ſtop its tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and divert as much as poſſibly he can, the Miſchief it threatens.</p>
            <p>If a Man imagines he can oblige the World, by communicating ſome thing uſeful; as he ought by no means to ſuppreſs it, ſo what he advances, ought to be attended with the Reaſons that led him into his Opinion; and theſe ſhou'd be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Conſideration of ſuch only, whoſe application in that way to which they tend, hath made them Judges of their Sufficiency; and then if his Arguments ſhou'd prove too weak, to ſupport his Oppinion, no other harm will enſue, but his Loſs of Labour, and that ſhare of Praiſe, which probably he might expect as the Reward of it.</p>
            <p>But when a <hi>Phyſician</hi> ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, to lay down <hi>Practical Rules,</hi> to all Mankind without Diſtinction,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0246501100:7"/>for the Preſervation of Health; and if theſe Rules ſhou'd prove pernicious and deſtructive to it, People will be apt to imagine, that he puts himſelf upon a Level with theſe <hi>Savages</hi> on the Sea-coaſt, who ſet out falſe Lights, to invite diſtreſſed <hi>Mariners</hi> to their deſtruction; that they may reap the Benefit of the Ship-wreck.</p>
            <p>You beſt know SIR, what were the Motives, that prompted you to publiſh your <hi>Eſſay of Health and long Life,</hi> as you call it; but I doubt, many will have Reaſon to wiſh it had never appear'd; it is now almoſt in every bodys hand, and that ſeeming ſelf-deniedneſs in your Preface, that Air of <hi>Piety</hi> that you put on, in almoſt every other Period, will perſwade many to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſo good a Man, wou'd never publiſh a Book to pamper his Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and wou'd never pretend to the Knowledge of any thing he was an abſolute Stranger to; theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, will, I am affraid weigh with many to their Diſtruction.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0246501100:8"/>
            <p>I intend by this to ſhow, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Attempt of this kind muſt be fruitleſs, if not pernicious, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging People to tamper with their Conſtitutions, which they cannot poſſibly regulate by any General Rules. And if your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance proves, that your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Animal Oeconomy,</hi> is not quite ſo extenſive as perhaps it ought to be; you muſt not take it amiſs if I point out a few of thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, from whence that unhappy Concluſion naturaly flows. If the Reaſons I ſhall offer to this purpoſe, are not ſufficient to make it appear, they cannot hurt you; but on the Contrary, if they happen to be juſt and convincing, no good Man will blame me for undeceiving People, in what regards a thing, ſo eſſential to their Well-being as Health.</p>
            <p>I have no Inclination to trace you thro' every thing that I think wrong in this Performance, becauſe, beſide the irkſome Employment of finding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0246501100:9"/>fault, that wou'd oblige me to write a Book at leaſt as large as yours. I ſhall endeavour therefore, to be as ſhort as the Subject will allow me.</p>
            <p>It is a common Saying, as you obſerve, that a Man paſt Forty, is either a Fool, or a Phyſician; and if it means any thing, it only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys, that by ſo long experience, a Man that is not a Fool, will know what things have beſt agreed with him; and his Reaſon will direct him to continue the Uſe of them, till ſome alteration in his Conſtitution makes them hurtful; and when the happens, he will find there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe required to make a Man a Phyſician, beſides living forty Years in the World; for beſide Diſeaſes, old Age will alter a Man's Conſtitution, and bring on Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which he could have no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of, when leſs advanced in Years. Of what uſe then, can his former Experience be to him, in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he never was in before?</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0246501100:10"/>
            <p>But let us ſuppoſe, that by forty Years Experience, a Man may have diſcover'd the proper Method he ſhou'd follow, through all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Stages and Accidents of Life, to preſerve his Health, and prolong his Days; yet this Method will only be applicable to himſelf, and ſuch Conſtitutions as exactly reſemble his own, in every Circumſtance; and ſuch another, perhaps will not be to be found among all the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>You tell us<note n="†" place="margin">Page 4.</note> 
               <q>"The Reflection is not more common than juſt, that he who lives Phyſicaly lives Miſerably, the truth is too great a nicety and exactneſs about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very minute Circumſtance that may impare our Health, is ſuch a Yoke and Slavery, as no Man of a free and generous Spirit wou'd ſubmit to; 'tis as the <hi>Poet</hi> expreſſes it, to dye for fear of dying."</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0246501100:11"/>
            <p>If this had been the Effect of any previous Reflection, or if you had believ'd it, <hi>Charity</hi> inclines me to think, that you wou'd not have been ſo induſtrious to contradict it, as appears from your ſubſequent <hi>Rules of Health;</hi> (as you are pleaſed to call them,) but have left Mankind to act for the Benefit of their Health, as Reaſon and Experience ſhould dictate to them; and when they are Indiſpos'd, to call in thoſe Aids that are proper to give them Relief; I mean ſuch Phyſicians, whoſe Skill in the <hi>Animal Oeconomy,</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Medica,</hi> hath render'd them capable to judge of the Nature of a Diſtemper, and to apply the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means to remove it. I am ſure every reaſonable Man is a better Judge of what he ought to do, for the Benefit of his Health, than any Phyſican can be, who is not inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Conſtitution.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0246501100:12"/>
            <p>When a Man has acquired a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Knowledge of the <hi>Animal Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy,</hi> and of the Power and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of theſe Medicines, proper to reſtore and preſerve Health, to ſuch a Man, I believe it is poſſible to lay down ſuch general Rules, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as may enable him to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the <hi>Art of healing,</hi> with ſucceſs and eaſe.</p>
            <p>But to pretend to direct Men ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of theſe things, how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves, to preſerve or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore their Health, is equally reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as if one ſhould give Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions to a blind Man, to go a long Journey by himſelf, thro' ways that he never cou'd poſſibly have any <hi>Idea</hi> of, and where every ſtep out of the way wou'd endanger if not deſtroy his Life. For how ſhall Men be able to adjuſt either the Kind or Quantity of Diet or Medicine, that may be neceſſary, to Conſtitutions they are Strangers to? How ſhall they be able to judge for themſelves, of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0246501100:13"/>that Exerciſe, and Air, that is proper for them, when they are unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Nature of thoſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, that can only enable them to diſtinguiſh.</p>
            <p>You will perhaps ſay, that you have acquainted them with theſe Symptoms to which your Directions are ſuitable; but may not a Perſon be afflicted with any Symptoms you can mention, and at the ſame time have others, which wou'd make the Method that might be proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſuch Symptoms, were they alone, deſtructive to the Patient, now they are complicated with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which you cou'd not poſſibly foreſee.</p>
            <p>What then muſt become of that Perſon, who having theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms you mention, follows your Advice, and whoſe want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will make him diſregard thoſe other Symptoms that will make your preſcription pernicious?</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0246501100:14"/>
            <p>Many Attempts have been made to lay down general Rules, for Mankind without diſtinction, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Health and prolong their Lives; but theſe Productions never obtain'd the End they aim'd at; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Conſtitutions and Habits of Mens bodies differ ſo much from one another, that any general Rule laid down to any number of Men for this Purpoſe, muſt be deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive, at leaſt to the greateſt Part of them, if they all comply with it.</p>
            <p>For if every Man, was exactly to purſue that method to <hi>Health and long Life,</hi> that is proper for him to follow, perhaps we ſhould not find two in ten thouſand, exactly purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Courſe, though their End wou'd be all the ſame; ſo that any general Rule enioyn'd to theſe ten thouſand, wou'd but at beſt be uſeful to two, and hurtful or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all the reſt.</p>
            <p>It very rarely, or never happens, that Diſeaſes, even of the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0246501100:15"/>ever affected two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in the ſame manner, in every Symptom, and the Method of Cure ought always to vary with the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. How then can you tell a Man, after what manner he ſhou'd govern himſelf in a Diſorder, when you cannot poſſibly know, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he is to be affected with it? Or tell how a Conſtitution ſhou'd be be regulated, which you are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Stranger to? And theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letudinary crazy Conſtutions, that you addreſs your ſelf to, actually labour under Diſtempers, or they wou'd not be ſo; and perhaps there are not two ſuch in all <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Complaints, and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions don't differ in many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>So infinite is the variety of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and Conſtitutions, that the beſt Phyſician in the World, can only determine, for theſe he is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with, and whoſe Symptoms he himſelf hath examin'd,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0246501100:16"/>and cannot with any ſafety, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon any thing, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of his own Senſes, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Practice by.</p>
            <p>What then muſt the Complexion of your Merit be, who pretending to point out the way to <hi>Health and long Life,</hi> lay down Rules for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to follow, which perhaps will never be uſeful to any, and may be hurtful and deſtructive to all, who regard your Advice? and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er your Reputation as a Phyſician, the worſe will be the Conſequences, and conſequently the greater your Guilt.</p>
            <p>Your Rules for Health, are all of them, either ſuch as have been known to all Mankind, ſince the World began; or miſtaken Notions, founded upon no Principles that ever reaſon dictated.</p>
            <p>When, or by whom was it ever denied, or even ſo much as doubted by the Thinking-Part of Mankind, (and you tell us, you don't write

            <p>That a very great regard ought to be had to the Conſtitution of the <hi>Air,</hi> to reſtore and preſerve Health, is a greater Truth than you ſeem to be aware of; but then, it is as true, that no one Conſtitution of <hi>Air,</hi> will agree with every habit of Body; and a Phyſician muſt be intimately acquainted with a Man's Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before he can preſcribe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Temperament of <hi>Air</hi> for him to live in.</p>

            <p>Here SIR, you muſt give me leave to inform you, that Diſeaſes and Health, are Circumſtances, directly oppoſite to one another, and what may be proper and fit to be done in the one, may by no means be ſafe, or convenient in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>e. g.</hi> In a continued Fever, where Obſtructions prevail in moſt of the <hi>Capillary Veſſels,</hi> and the uſual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges from the Body, by inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſpiration, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the larger and paſſable Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, to which the circulating Fluid is confin'd, are for that reaſon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd, and to give a Perſon in this Caſe, even that kind, and quantity of meat and drink, that wou'd be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0246501100:20"/>neceſſary in a ſtate of Health to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, wou'd increaſe the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, by increaſing the quantity of Fluid, in the paſſable or pervious Veſſels.</p>
            <p>In all theſe we call acute Caſes, the circulating Fluid is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a ſmaller number of Veſſels, but there being a Check put to the uſual Expence and Diſcharge from it, by the ſeveral <hi>Emunctories</hi> of the Body, which made the former ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from eating and drinking in a State of health uſeful: <hi>Temperance</hi> therefore, whatever hath been a Man's way of living, is not only ſafe, but abſolutely neceſſary, till theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which are the Diſeaſe, be removed; and the ſeveral <hi>Excretory's</hi> are again qualified, to throw off the Superfluities, from the Maſs of Blood. Care muſt likewiſe be taken in theſe Caſes, to dilute the Blood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax the Fibres; and theſe Medicines which can effect this, will diſſolve the Union of the combin'd Particles,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0246501100:21"/>that obſtructed the <hi>Capillary's,</hi> and ſtood in the Way of the circulating Fluid, or Extra-corporeal Secretions.</p>
            <p>But if theſe diluteing Medicines, which are convenient in this Caſe, were given to one, where the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Secretions, are to the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Fluid in the Body, in that juſt Proportion, that is neceſſary to Health; they wou'd increaſe the Secretions, deſtroy that neceſſary Proportion, and beget Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>And if a Man in a good State of Health, who has accuſtom'd himſelf to eat and drink plentifully, ſhou'd ſuddenly leave of that Method, and betake himſelf to a ſpare Diet all at once; the <hi>Excretory's</hi> which throw of the Extra-corporeal Secretions, being large enough to carry off the Refuſe of his Extravagance, would upon ſo ſudden a Change, throw off more than ſuch an abſtenious-diet cou'd ſpare, and leave too little in the Veſſels, to ſupport the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with that velocity that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0246501100:22"/>to Health, for that the Blood may be propelled with that degree of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity, that is neceſſary to preſerve Health, the Veſſels muſt all be fill'd in ſuch a manner, as the Impulſe of the Fluid, and the Re-action of the Veſſels, may be adjuſted to this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary velocity; more or leſs will beget a Diſeaſe: And the Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being ſuddenly drain'd, and depriv'd of their uſual ſupply, the preſſure of the Fluid againſt them will decreaſe with the Quantity of it; and the Impulſe of the Fluid, and the Re-action of the Veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal, ſuch a Diminution, from a Conſtitution that is not labouring under an acute Diſtemper, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily leſſen the Velocity of the Fluid proportionaly.</p>
            <p>Hence it is evident, that the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Change which you recommend, wou'd make ſuch a Diſproportion between the Quantity of Fluid, and the Dimenſions of the Veſſels, as wou'd render the Circulation very
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0246501100:23"/>languid; and this ſlow motion of the Fluid, wou'd give its Parts an Opportunity of combineing, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Bodies too groſs, to paſs thro' the more minute <hi>Capillary</hi>'s, and the Obſtructions that wou'd enſue from thence, wou'd conſequently be the Fountain of many grievous Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The ill Conſequences of ſuch ſudden Changes, have been taken Notice of, by every Judicious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver in Phyſick, ſince <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and as many of them, as have wrote upon this Subject, have faithfully caution'd Mankind againſt them.</p>
            <p>I have already given my Reaſons, why I think it dangerous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe either Diet, or Medicine at random. And now give me leave to point at ſome things, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me in a very odd Light. In the Directions you have given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the quantity of Food.</p>
            <p>You obſerve<note n="*" place="margin">Page 39.</note> 
               <q>"Since our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites are deceitful, and Weight and Meaſure troubleſome and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0246501100:24"/>Singular; we muſt have recourſe to a Rule independent of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, <hi>&amp;c".</hi>
               </q> You propoſe here, to give us a Rule for meaſuring the Quantity of our Food, independent of our Senſations; and if this has any meaning at all, it muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting us, to eat and drink by gueſs, without any regard to the Quantity; for we cannot poſſibly form a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any thing, without the Aſſiſtance of our Senſes. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you adviſe us<note n="†" place="margin">Page 40.</note>
               <hi>to meaſure the Quantity by our Eye,</hi> but then there is one of the Senſations employ'd, unleſs you deny Viſion to be a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Then you go on;<note n="†" place="margin">Page 40.</note> 
               <q>"Thus, the two Wings of a middling Pullet, or one Wing and both Legs; three Ribs of a middling Neck of Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; two middling Slices of a Leg or Shoulder of Mutton, ſomewhat leſs of Beef may be ſufficient, <hi>&amp;c".</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if it were prudent or reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to determine the Quantity of Meat, that a Man ſhould take,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0246501100:25"/>without being appriſed of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Conſtitution; what can any Body make of this Direction? As if a middling Slice of Meat, was a determined Quantity, which every Body knew; however People may determine what they themſelves call a middling Slice, yet I am ſure, it is impoſſible for any Body, that has not been accuſtomed to ſee you eat, to tell what you mean by it.</p>
            <p>Every thinking Man, I believe is an Enemy to Debauching in ſtrong Liquours, but I cannot be of your Opinion, when you recommend and prefer ſmall Wines to the ſtronger Kind. Indeed if a Man was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to drink a large Quantity of Wine every Day, then ſmall Wines ſhould be prefer'd, provided they were ſound: But as no Man is obliged to drink more than he cares for, I ſhould prefer a convenient Quantity of the more generous ſort, either by it ſelf, or mix'd with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if it was for no other Reaſon,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0246501100:26"/>but becauſe ſuch Wines, being much leſs Subject to Putrefaction than the ſmaller Kind, People will have a much better Chance, for drinking that which is Good. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the vaſt Quantity of Wine drank in <hi>England,</hi> very few are Judges when it is good of its Kind, or otherwiſe, unleſs it happen to be ſpoil'd to a very great Degree. And you your ſelf confeſs the good Effects of generous Wines and Food, not only moderately, but plentifully taken: where you ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Page 14.</note> 
               <q>"That thoſe who have drank ſtrong Liquours ſo plentifully, as to have thereby a ſtrong Circulation and full Perſpiration, ſeldom or never catch Cold. And this is the Reaſon why rich Foods and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wines, moderately uſed, become ſo excellent an Antedote in Infectious and Epedemick Diſtempers, <hi>&amp;c".</hi>
               </q> You are ſo far in the Right in my Opinion, in imagining that Men are leſs apt to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0246501100:27"/>receive injuries from the <hi>Circumam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air,</hi> when their Veſſels are filled by rich Food and generous Wines, than diſeaſed People are, whoſe Veſſels are lank for want of that competent Quantity of Fluid neceſſary to Health. But this truth is the Conſequence of a Cauſe, quite different from what you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it. You ſuppoſe the violence with which the matter of Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flys from the Body (which you call a brisk <hi>Atmoſphere</hi>) reſiſts the preſſure of the Circumambient Air, and prevents its having acceſs to the Body. Your Words are theſe, ſpeaking of the effects of rich Food and generous Wines, you ſay they<note n="*" place="margin">Page 15.</note> 
               <q>"Not only baniſh Fear and Terror, but as they make ſo full and free a ſtream of Perſpiration, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo active and brisk an <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere,</hi> as ſuffers no noxious ſteams or mixtures, in the Air to come within it, but drives and beats off the Enemy to a diſtance; but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0246501100:28"/>Perſons of viſcous heavy Fluids, of poor and ſizey Juices, of little or no Perſpiration, ſuch as generally all Studious, Sedentary and ſickly Perſons are, but eſpecially thoſe that are ſubject to Nervous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, muſt neceſſarily ſuffer under theſe poiſonous Mixtures in the Air, if they do not cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and carefully ſence againſt them, or take not a preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and Antidote when tainted, for beſides the Air that gets thro' the Perſpiratory Ducts into our Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>James Keill,</hi> in his Eſſays upon the <hi>Animal Oeconomy,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the force of the Heart, equal to a Weight of 5 Ounces only; and that the velocity of the Blood at the Heart, to that in the minute <hi>Capillary</hi>'s (and he did not deſcend ſo far as the <hi>Excretory</hi>'s of inſenſible Perſpiration) was as 5.233 to 1. And here you ſuppoſe, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of inſenſible Perſpiration, whoſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0246501100:29"/>velocity is the leaſt of any, is upon ſome occaſions, propelled with a Force, ſufficient to repell the Preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> upon the Surface of a Man's Body, which in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium is computed to be equal to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 39.900 and 40.000 Pound.</p>
            <p>I confeſs Dr. <hi>Keill</hi> was miſtaken in this Calculation; for if the force, which propells the <hi>Animal</hi> Fluids, was ſo much inferiour to the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation cou'd not be carried on, and Conſequently no <hi>Animal</hi> cou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in the Air we live in; for that Reaſon, I ſhall not preſs this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine as an Argument againſt you; nor is it neceſſary here, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, how much you are miſtaken in the other Extream.</p>
            <p>But the true Cauſe, why People whoſe Veſſels are well filled with good Nouriſhment, from rich Food, and generous Wines, are not apt to catch Cold, or be tainted with infectious Diſtempers, is becauſe, when the Veſſels are all thus filled,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0246501100:30"/>the <hi>Excretory</hi>'s, upon the Surface of the Body, are charged in proportion; and being ſwell'd with the Matter of Perſpiration, they preſs againſt, and ſhut up theſe Orrifices, which convey the Air, or any thing elſe from the Surface of our Bodies, to our Maſs of Blood; and when the Veſſels are not filled as they ought to be, from Sickneſs, or any other Cauſe, the <hi>Excretory</hi>'s of Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are proportionaly empty, and conſequently can't preſs upon theſe Orrifices, but will leave them open to receive the Air, or any kind of Fluid, that may happen to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Skin of ſuch a Perſon. Theſe <hi>Excretory</hi>'s that emitt the Matter of inſenſible Perſpiration, can never be the ſame, which receive any thing into the Blood from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us; becauſe if they are not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, they are conſtantly throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Matter of inſenſible Perſpiration, and they cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, give acceſs to one Fluid from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0246501100:31"/>without, at the ſame time they are diſcharging another from within; and if they are obſtructed, they can neither do the one nor the other.</p>
            <p>That Fat is harder to digeſt, than the more ſolid part of <hi>Animals,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Page 25.</note> is a Poſition you ſeem to be very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of and quote SIR <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Authority, to ſupport your Opinion; and though the Juſtice which the World has done to the Character of that great Man, will leave but few Diſſenters, from any Opinion of his; yet ſince the beſt may err, and the greateſt Genious may be ſometime miſtaken, I have ventur'd to think differently, and ſhall give you my Reaſons why I do ſo.</p>
            <p>Don't we find, that Fat diſolves more eaſily, than any other part of of the <hi>Animal</hi> ſubſtance, by all the Trials we can make to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe out of the Stomach; what then ſhould make it leſs ſoluble in the Stomach, than any where elſe? And don't we find that a much leſs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0246501100:32"/>degree of Heat, than is in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of any <hi>Animal,</hi> will diſolve it infinitely ſooner, than any other part of the <hi>Animal</hi> can be diſſolved, by all the artful Contrivances we can think of? So that abſtracting from the Action of the Stomach, the heat alone, wou'd diſſolve or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it ſooner, than any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can be.</p>
            <p>And if becauſe of its ſmoothneſs, as you imagine, it cou'd in ſome meaſure elude the Action of the Stomach, yet its Parts being leſs tenacious, than that of any other ſubſtance, the leſs force would be ſufficient to divide them. But when the Stomach is contracted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote digeſtion, the Contraction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal in every part of it, the Matter contain'd in it, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly evade the Preſſure, tho it ſhou'd ſhift its Place. And I am informed by Men of great Probity, who tell me from their own Experience, that the <hi>Turtle,</hi> which they eat frequently
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0246501100:33"/>in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> is the fatteſt of all <hi>Animals;</hi> and that it is the wholeſomeſt, and lighteſt Food in the World.</p>
            <p>I can't imagine, why all theſe <hi>Invectives</hi> againſt <hi>Punch;</hi> as <hi>Rack-Punch</hi> is commonly made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> tho' I believe this Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may not be agreeable to every Conſtitution, yet I imagine by the generality of People, it may be drank as ſafely, as an equal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Wine; for ſince it contains a ſmaller quantity of Spirits, it will conſequently be leſs apt to heat us.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0246501100:38"/>that they make it ſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Purpoſes of drinking, as we do ſmall Beer in <hi>England.</hi> Nor is it to be ſuppos'd, that a People whoſe Commerce obliges them to have Dealings, with every Country in <hi>Europe,</hi> wou'd want any Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency that <hi>Europe</hi> can afford.</p>
            <p>And I am inform'd by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of good Underſtanding, and great Integrity, who lived upwards of 30 Years in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and but lately came from it; that the Diſeaſe called the dry Belly-Ach, which is ſo peculiar to that Country, attacks the Women as well as the Men; and that the Women there, are particularly Remarkable for their Temperance, and abſtinence from ſtrong Liquors; and that many of both Sexes, who never taſted <hi>Punch,</hi> or indulg'd in any ſtrong Liquor in their Lives, are afflcted with this Diſtemper; if this be true, and I have no reaſon to doubt my Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, then this Diſtemper muſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0246501100:39"/>have ſome other Source than <hi>Punch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Bath</hi> be the only Cure for this Diſtemper, as you boldly affirm it is; how comes it to paſs, that ſo many are cured of it in the <hi>Weſt-Indies?</hi> And tho' the meaning of your recommending the <hi>Bath,</hi> and of your Encomiums upon the <hi>Water,</hi> and other Conveniencies of that Place, upon ſeveral Occaſions, is by no means Myſterious; yet you have raſhly ſtrain'd that Point too far in this Place, and it will never contribute to the End for which I believe you deſign'd it; for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably you never can have any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, under theſe Circumſtances, but from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> who at the ſame time they read your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of the <hi>Bath,</hi> to Save and Cure them, they will find your Miſtake, in ſaying it is the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; ſince they all know, that many more are cured of it at Home, than ever came to the <hi>Bath</hi> to find Relief; and that going to a colder
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0246501100:40"/>Climate, never fails to produce a Cure of this Diſtemper, without taking any other Remedy.</p>
            <p>And this Diſeaſe, is ſo far from always cutting them off in a few Days, that they who live ſoberly when they are ſo afflicted, generally recover in a very little Time; and it will hold thoſe, who continue the exceſſive uſe of ſtrong Liquors many Months, nay Years, before they are either kill'd by it, or cured of it. Theſe things, which every Body in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> know to be true, will neceſſarily make them conclude, that you know nothing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Diſtemper. And if this be true, your telling them that the <hi>Bath</hi> is their only Remedy, will hardly bring them there to become your Patients.</p>
            <p>Beſides we cannot ſuppoſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting upon the good Senſe of theſe People, that they would indulge themſelves in a Liquor ſo pernicious to them, as you think
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0246501100:41"/>
               <hi>Punch</hi> is, when they have variety of other Liquors, that would anſwer all the Purpoſes of drinking.</p>
            <p>This Diſeaſe that you aſcribe to <hi>Punch,</hi> is I am told, the Effect of catching cold in that Country, which the ſober People carefully guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; but thoſe who uſe to intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves with ſtrong Liquors, often neglect the proper Means to prevent taking cold, by ſleeping ſometimes in the open Air, or not taking the proper Care to avoid this ill, by Means that are neceſſary to be uſed within Doors. For tho' a Man is leſs apt to catch cold, when his Veſſels are all turg'd with the Liquor that hath made him drunk; yet after ſome time, when the ſeveral <hi>Emunctory</hi>'s of the Body, have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the ſuperfluous Fluid from the Veſſels, they will become more lank, and the Pores of the Skin will be more open, to admitt any nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Steams that may be in the Air, than they were before; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0246501100:42"/>a more than common Care, is requiſite to prevent a Man's taking cold in this State. And if a Man catches cold there, after being drunk, he will be ſeized with this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whatever Liquor he debauch'd in. Indeed as all the Ingredients of <hi>Ruin-Punch,</hi> are the Product of that Country, they are conſequently to he purchas'd very cheap, and for this Reaſon the poorer ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Sailors that go thither (who are the Bulk of thoſe who delight in drinking to Exceſs) often get the dry Belly-Ach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By catching cold, after being drunk with <hi>Punch.</hi> But ſince <hi>Punch</hi> is no more acceſſary to this Diſtemper, than any other ſtrong Liquor, that a Man debauches in, and ſince ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Perſons who never taſted <hi>Punch,</hi> are ſubject to this Diſtemper, I think it very unreaſonable, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this Miſchief wholy to <hi>Punch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you wrote your Eſſay of the <hi>Gout,</hi> &amp;c. You took a Fancy to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0246501100:43"/>ſay, that the Nerves were ſolid without Cavities; and therefore contained no Fluid. This Notion, has led you into many extravagant Expreſſions, about the Condition of the Nerves; which this laſt Product<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of yours is crouded with. <hi>e g.</hi> What <hi>Idea,</hi> can be annex'd to that Expreſſion (ſo often uſed by you) of <hi>Bracing,</hi> and <hi>Winding</hi> up the Nerves? Every one knows how a Drum is braced, and how a Fiddle ſtring is wound up; but how thoſe Operations can be applied to the Nerves, in any part of the <hi>Animal</hi> Body, is what I am ſure no Man can imagine.</p>
            <p>In your Treatiſe of the <hi>Gout,</hi> &amp;c. you have theſe Words<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay of the Gout, Page 91.</note> 
               <q>"I have a long time ſuſpected the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts given by them of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Diſeaſes, that were found on <hi>Nervous</hi> Juices, and <hi>Fluids,</hi> their Motion, Nature, and Qualities: And yet it will be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0246501100:44"/>a great Baulk on the <hi>Theory</hi> of Diſtempers, the boaſted <hi>Politeneſs,</hi> and admired <hi>Fineneſs</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age has advanced, ſhould there really be no ſuch Fluids in <hi>Animal Body's".</hi>
               </q> This, as you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, wou'd have been no ſmall Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to the learned World; and I'll tell you anotherthing, (which perhaps you do notknow) it wou'd have been no ſmall Addition to their Surpriſe, to have found that you had made the Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' the Arguments you bring to ſupport your Opinion, that the Nerves contain no Fluid, are of ſuch a Nature, that it may ſeem trifling to take Notice of them, yet I ſhall be at ſome Pains with the laſt thing you ſay in defence of this Notion; becauſe I preſume you brought it thus in the Rear, as thinking it the ſtrongeſt and moſt conducive to your Purpoſe. The Sum of this laſt Argument is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Nerves are <hi>Cylindrical</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0246501100:45"/>Tubes, whereas the Arteries and Veins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fluid are <hi>Conical,</hi> and Nature being uniform in her Operations, therefore you conclude, that the Nerves contain no Fluid.</p>
            <p>The Arteries by dividing into Branches, muſt grow gradually nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, and for that Reaſon are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical;</hi> and the Nerves are <hi>Cylinders</hi> becauſe they do not communicate with one another, but run on in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Canal's, from their Origines to their Extremities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Wiſdom of our Creator is ſignaly manifeſted in contriveing the Structure of the Nerves, different from that of all the other Veſſels in the</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>Body. For as the Nerves do not communicate with one another, but run on in ſeparate Canal's from their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigins to their Extremities: An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, or addition of Fluid, to any Quantity of Nerves, determin'd to move a Muſcle or Muſcles, runs on, or is propagated to their Extremities,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0246501100:46"/>without communicating their additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fluid, or Impulſe, to any of the other Nerves; which cou'd not happen, if their Structure was like that of the Arteries: For if the Nerves that ſerve in bending and extending of a Limb, were Branches from a common Trunk, with which they had a Communication, any impulſe at the Trunk, would be propagated equally to all the Branches, the Benders and Extenders. So that inſtead of regular and voluntary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ſhould be Diſtorted with Convulſions.</hi> e. g. <hi>Suppoſe a Power at</hi> A. <hi>determining to</hi>

            <p>This Demonſtration, I have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from a Syſtem of <hi>Animal Oeconomy,</hi> that is not yet publiſhed; I wiſh when it is, it may be effectual, to put an End to all that unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Babbling, which hath hitherto confounded this uſeful Knowledge.</p>
            <p>It is no difficult Matter to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive, how the Fibres may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by increaſing the Quantity of Fluid in the Veſſels which they compoſe. But by what power in Nature,<note n="†" place="bottom">Eſſay of the Gout.</note> can the Fibres be drawn in, and ſink into their own Subſtance? which you ſay is the Caſe in Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Motion. You are realy ſo unhappy in all your Expreſſions, that regard the <hi>Animal Oeconomy,</hi> that if I was not certain, you live by the <hi>Trade</hi> of Phyſick, I ſhould Imagine you wrote purpoſely to turn it into Redicule.</p>
            <p>This SIR, is a very incredulous. Age we live in; and theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> whom Providence hath favoured
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0246501100:48"/>with Knowledge and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will never regard an Opinion, without good Reaſons to ſupport it, be it never ſo boldly Aſſerted. So obſtinate are they in their Averſion to Folly, that a Man who Speaks and Writes without thinking, may babble and ſcribble from his <hi>Cradle</hi> to his <hi>Grave,</hi> without meeting any other Recompence, but <hi>Redicule</hi> for his Pains. And by this Means, they vainly imagine to reſtrain the Folly of Writing and Speaking at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; I ſay vainly imagine it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>you know</hi> it is attempting an Impoſſibility.</p>
            <p>To be <hi>humbly Proud,</hi> is no new Character, and yet I believe you may juſtly boaſt, that no Body ever came up to it ſo fully as you have done; a ſingular <hi>Ambition,</hi> peculiar to your ſelf, hath made you (upon ſome Occaſion or other) reject e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Opinion, that has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received in that Way, you wou'd fain perſwade the World

And at the ſame time you are denying and deſpiſing the moſt reaſonable Notions, of the beſt Phyſicians, you condeſcend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your ſelf, in all the unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible <hi>Jargon</hi> of the <hi>Mountebanks</hi> (tho' I preſume they are your Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the ſame reaſon that they hate one another) and treat us with whole Pages of uncouth Words and Phraſes, with as much meaning, as the wandring Orator delivers them from the Stage. This Method may get you the Applauſe of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant who are always fond of what they do not underſtand; and they being the greateſt part of Mankind, and generally the richeſt, you may advance by it, what the unthinking herd of Man, miſtake for Intereſt: but ſure <hi>you</hi> can be under no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſtooping to ſuch meanneſs!

            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0246501100:51"/>
            <p>And then you ſay, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the Muſcles n Palſies, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> proceeds from Obſtructions in the Nerves; for how can the Nerves be obſtructed if they contain no Fluid?</p>
            <p>The deſire of Knowledge, is a very laudable Quality as any human Nature can boaſt of; But he who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to graſp at the Knowledge of a Thing, beyond the reach of his Capacity, and notwithſtanding this, will pretend to all the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, that a <hi>Genious</hi> equal to the Task, could poſſibly arrive at; is a Character much of a Piece with him, who deſcribes foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and the particular Qualities of Great Perſons, as if he had been moſt intimately acquainted with them, when he never poſſibly cou'd have acceſs to know any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, but what publick Fame, gave him in common with all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and all this from the Vanity of being thought a Man of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0246501100:52"/>and not ignorant of what any Body would deſire to know. That there are many ſuch Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the World, is a melancholy Truth beyond Contradiction; and the deſpicable appearance they make Society when detected, is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every Man of Senſe.</p>
            <p>You preſcribe Exerciſe indefinitely to all Mankind, as if reſt was never neceſſary, and Exerciſe never hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. That Exerciſe is an excellent Remedy in ſome Caſes, to reſtore and preſerve Health is very true; but what Rules have you laid down, or could you lay down, to teach all Men, what kind and quantity of Exerciſe is proper for them all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſeveral Circumſtances to to take. And it is impoſſible, for Men Ignorant of the Nature of their Conſtitutions, and of any Bodily Diſtemper, they may happen to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under, to judge aptly for themſelves in this matter.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0246501100:53"/>
            <p>When you come to mention the Uſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> you acknowledge, that Phyſicians are the only proper Judges, when, and in what Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity it is to be exhibited; now as one great Effect of this Medicine, is to calm and diſpoſe Men to reſt, which is the Oppoſite of Exerciſe; does it not follow, that they muſt likewiſe, be the only Judges of the Quantity of Exerciſe, that Men ſhould take? For when it is fit for Men to be quiet, then moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is fit for them to leave off Exerciſe; and of Conſequence, if Men who are not Phyſicians cannot Judge for themſelves of the one, they cannot poſſibly determine the proper Seaſons, and Quantity of the other.</p>
            <p>In another Place, you ſeem to give your Aſſent to what I have been alledging in plainer Terms, where you ſay,<note n="†" place="margin">Page 27</note> from theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules, <hi>taking in the particular Complexions and Habits,</hi> &amp;c. Here

            <p>Wou'd not any one that impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly believed in you, imagine from this paſſage, that every individual <hi>Animal Fibre,</hi> was a rational Being, and had the Power of diſcerning at a diſtance, what was convenient or hurtful to it?

            <p>What we call (but very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) bodily pain, never happens but when the Fibres are extended beyond their Natural length; and for that reaſon, an Inciſion made with a blunt Inſtrument, ragged in the Edge, gives more pain, than that which is made with one that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And when ſuch Pain is produced from an internal Cauſe, it happens from the Obſtruction of ſome part of the <hi>Animal Fluid,</hi> by which means the Veſſels in that part ſwell, and the Fibres which compoſe their Sides, are ſtretch'd and in danger of being broke, and tore aſſunder,

               <q>"The acute Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether pleaſurable or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful have much the ſame effect, and work after the ſame manner as acute Diſeaſes do, they effect a brisk and lively Circulation of the Fluids, criſp up and conſtrict the Solids for ſome time. Thus ſudden guſts of Joy or Grief, Pleaſure or Pain, ſtimulate and ſpur the nervous Fibres, and Coats of the <hi>Animal Tubes;</hi> and thereby give a celerity and brisker
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0246501100:67"/>motion to their included Fluids".</q> There is ſomething ſo extravagantly wild in this Notion (tho' you have often expreſs'd your ſelf much to the ſame Purpoſe) that I am truly at a loſs what Anſwer to make to ſo odd a proportion <hi>viz.</hi> that the Perceptions and Senſations of the Mind fly about the Body in the form of a palpable Fluid, which contains hard and pointed Bodies; for ſuch they muſt be, to ſtimulate the Fibres in the manner you contend for.</p>
            <p>That a great part of the nervous Fluid is govern'd by the affections of the Mind, is evident from the Bodily motions which depend upon the Will. And as the <hi>Mind</hi> is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently affected, it may no doubt reſtrain or increaſe the flow of this Fluid to the detriment of the <hi>Animal Oeconomy.</hi> But you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that theſe very Senſations and Affections of the <hi>Mind,</hi> which we term Pain and Pleaſure (not as they prevail upon the <hi>Mind</hi> to act upon

            <p>But all Senſations, whether plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant or painful, exiſt no where but in the <hi>Mind,</hi> and however it be common to call that diſagreeable Senſation, which ariſes from any Diſorder in the <hi>Animal Organs, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Pain,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther painful Affections of the <hi>Mind,</hi> which do not proceed from that Cauſe; yet in <hi>Philoſophical Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> no Phraſe nor Expreſſion, ſhou'd be admitted, that is not ſtrictly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Truth. And tho' the Soul readily perceives, when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is either diſorder'd, or better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for performing the Functions neceſſary to <hi>Life and Health;</hi> yet the Organs themſelves are incapable of any Senſation, and conſequently there is no ſuch thing in Nature as <hi>Bodily Pain;</hi> and therefore that Phraſe ought never to be uſed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0246501100:69"/>where cloſe Reaſoning is required.</p>

               <q>"That Beauty or Perfection gives plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to both Parts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound".</q> That is to the <hi>Mind</hi> and its Organs; I thought there had not been a thinking Man in Being, who did not know, that the Organs of the Body were compoſed of meer Matter, and conſequently incapable of any Senſation; and that Knowledge and Perception, can only exiſt in the <hi>Mind,</hi> and is the diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of it.</p>
            <p>I have a better Opinion of you, than to believe you mean, what I think this Paſſage implys; for ſince Knowledge and Perception, are theſe eſſential Quallities of the Soul, which denote its exiſtence; and ſince all things which are endued with the ſame Properties, muſt neceſſarily be of the ſame Species and Nature; why ſhou'd we then believe the Soul
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0246501100:70"/>immortal, if theſe Properties from whence we derive our belief of its Immortallity, are common to the Body which evidently periſhes? Nor does the Abſurdity of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours end here, for when we conſider it, with what you call the 4th <hi>Prop.</hi> of this Diſſertation, we will find them amount to the moſt hideous <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that ever was imagin'd; equally ſhocking and repugnant to Reaſon: Your Words are theſe,<note n="‖" place="margin">Page 149</note>
