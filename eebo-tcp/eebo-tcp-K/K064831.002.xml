            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Thoſe who are acquainted with the characteriſtic genius and ſtyle of Oſſian, as well as with thoſe of the Roman claſſics, will wonder at ſuch an undertaking.

                  <head>MACKENZIE, HENRY, ESQ.</head>
                  <p>A native of Scotland, and a gentleman, whoſe elegance as a writer have juſtly entitled him to the name of the Addiſon of the North. The firſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which he aſſumed as an author, was that of a ſentimental and pathetic writer, in which he met with conſiderable ſucceſs. "The Man of Feeling," a novel, his firſt publication, made its appearance in 1771, and was very favourably received. In the ſame year he publiſhed, "The Purſuits of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," a poem; and two years afterward, "The Man of the World," a novel, in two duodecimo volumes. The Novel of Julia de Rubignè, in two volumes, duodecimo, is alſo, we believe, to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his pen. In the dramatic line of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he has produced the Prince of Tunis, a tragedy, acted at Edinburgh, in 1773, and, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he altered the Fatal Curioſity of Lillo, as it was repreſented at the Hay Market Theatre. Mr. Mackenzie edited, in 1793, a quarto volume of "Poems by the late Rev. Dr. Thomas Blacklock, together, with an Eſſay on the Education of the Blind," to which he prefixed a moſt intereſting and elegant Account of the Author's Life and Writings. He announced, at the ſame time, the intended pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of ſome Sermons and other proſe works, by Dr. Blacklock, which, we belive, have not yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0102600102:8"/>
appeared. In the year 1779, when a ſociety of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary gentlemen at Edinburgh, came to the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of publiſhing a Periodical Paper, Mr. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenzie, then of the Exchequer in that City, was entruſted with the conduct of the work. His nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Papers in the Mirror, the firſt production of that Society, have been particularly diſtinguiſhed for their elegance and neatneſs. To the Lounger, a periodical paper, afterward publiſhed by the ſame Society, he likewiſe contributed ſome very diſtinguiſhed Eſſays. Indeed, we are of opinion, that without the attraction of Mr. Mackenzie's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, neither of theſe publications would have ranked very highly in the claſs of Periodical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. But poſſeſſed of theſe, they may boaſt a ſaving principle, and a ſterling excellence in their conformation, which gives them a durable value and will inſure them a laſting eſtimation among the works of taſte.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>The following is a ſentence which was paſſed upon Mr. Macken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie, by a reviewer of the day, upon the appearance of his Man of Feeling.</p>

                  <p>An Officer, of a character no leſs honourable in the literary than in the military world. He pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, in 1787, Strictures on Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton's Hiſtory of the Campaigns in North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, in 1780 and 1781. Mr. Mackenzie was perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerned, as well as Col. Tarleton, in ſome of the moſt conſiderable actions of theſe campaigns, and he animadverts with the greateſt ſeverity upon the Colonel's "Hiſtory." His publication ſeems to have been undertaken from a motive of great generoſity and friendly zeal, viz. to vindicate the fame of Lord Cornwallis, whoſe military conduct had ſuffered certain diſrepectful inſinuations from Colonel Tarleton, and whoſe diſtance from home deprived him of an opportunity of defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Mr. Mackenzie has, ſince that time, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a "Sketch of the War with Tippoo Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taun," in two quarto volumes, which were printed at Calcutta, in 1793 and 1794. This work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains much excellent and circumſtantial information, related in a ſtrain of impartiality, and in an honeſt unaſſuming manner, which cannot fail to gratify every reader.</p>

In 1786, Dr. Macknight publiſhed, in quarto, "A new literal Tranſlation, from the original Greek, of the Apoſtle Paul's firſt and ſecond Epiſtles to the Theſſalonians," which was intended as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of a literal Tranſlation of all the Apoſtolic Epiſtles, with Commentaries, Notes, and Eſſays, about which he had for many years been employed. This complete work did not make its appearance till 1795, when it was publiſhed, in four volumes, quarto, and added a new laurel to the brow of this, reſpectable veteran in biblical literature.</p>

In 1765, his maſterly Tranſlation of Moſheim's Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory made its firſt appearance, in two volumes, quarto. It experienced a moſt favourable recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was ſoon reprinted, in ſix volumes, octavo, which is the form in which all the ſubſequent edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been publiſhed. A Supplement to the quarto edition, containing the corrections, additional notes and diſſertations which had been added to the octavo edition, was publiſhed by Dr. Maclaine, in quarto, in 1768. Few publications, upon their firſt appearance, have been more generally read than Mr. Soame Jenyns' View of the internal Evidence of Chriſtianity. Upon the occaſion of this publication, Dr. Maclaine addreſſed a Series of Letters to that gentleman, publiſhed in a duodecimo volume, in 1777. Theſe Letters were written to ſerve the beſt purpoſes of Chriſtianity, upon a due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the diſtinguiſhed eminence of Mr. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyns as a writer, of the ſingular mixture of piety, wit, error, wiſdom, and paradox, exhibited in his publication, and of his defence of Chriſtianity, upon principles which would lead men to enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0102600102:13"/>
or to ſcepticiſm, according to their different diſpoſitions. His only publications, ſince this time, have been two Faſt Sermons, preached in 1793 and 1797.</p>

He boaſts a very high and deſerved reputation in the literary world, as an Editor of Shakſpeare, and appears to have devoted almoſt the whole of his time to the ſtudy and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his immortal Author.

In 1790, he produced his edition of the Plays and Poems of Shakſpeare, in ten crown oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0102600102:20"/>
volumes, which, though inferior in ſplendour to the elegant edition ſince publiſhed by Mr. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, has obtained its editor moſt diſtinguiſhed cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit for his aſſiduity and critical accumen. Two years after the appearance of this work, Mr. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone publiſhed a Letter to Dr. Farmer, relative to ſome diſtorted facts, in a pamphlet, entitled, "Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory Criticiſms" on his edition of Shakſpeare; and in 1796, an octavo volume, entitled, "An En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Authenticity of certain Miſcellaneous Papers, &amp;c. attributed to Shakſpeare." The latter of theſe performances had the honour of giving the finiſhing ſtroke to the infamous forgery of the Shakſperian MSS. (vide Ireland) and if we extend our indulgence to ſome extraneous matter, and a certain ſelf-complacent, ſarcaſtic aſperity, flowing through the volume, we cannot but pronounce it, a moſt maſterly piece of criticiſm, and a very learned and entertaining book. By this work Mr. Malone made a pious offering to the Manes of his celebrated author, and gave the public a new proof of his indefatigable diligence and accuracy. Mr. Malone was one of the executors of Sir Joſhua Reynolds, and publiſhed his works, in two volumes, quarto, in 1797, prefixing an Account of the Life and Writings of the Author.</p>

He was educated at Eton School, took the degree of Bachelor of Arts at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, in 1774, and was, for ſome time, Fellow of Trinity College. His firſt publication was a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0102600102:33"/>
quarto pamphlet, in 1781, conſiſting of Runic Odes, imitated from the Norſe Tongue. Two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, he publiſhed in a ſmall octavo volume, an Eſſay on the Evidence External and Internal, relating to the Poems attributed to Thomas Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. This performance contains a general view of the whole controverſy reſpecting thoſe poems, and is juſtly entitled to the character of a candid and comprehenſive Eſſay. We believe that Dr. Glynn, of Cambridge, gave Mr. Mathias ſome aſſiſtance in this work. In theſe latter days Mr. Mathias has amuſed himſelf and the public, with ſeveral ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirical pieces, which, while the times are peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly in need of ſuch effuſions, do the higheſt honour to his wit and talents. It is not without ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that we ſpeak on this ſubject, as his publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this caſt have always been anonymous, and the author has been ſtudiouſly concealed. Yet when we reflect that in every ſuch inſtance his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions have done him the utmoſt credit, both as a ſcholar and as a man, and, that it is our duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our information, on theſe occasions, to the public, we truſt we may proceed. To his pen, we have little heſitation in aſcribing the three following excellent poetical pamphlets, viz. "The Political Dramatiſt of the Houſe of Commons, in 1795;" a Pair of Epiſtles to Dr. Randolph and the Earl of Jerſey; and the Imperial Epiſtle from Kien Long to George III; as alſo a Letter to the Marquis of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, chiefly on the Subject of the numerous

We ſubjoin this excellent performance to the above liſt, from a conviction, that, conſidered in every poſſible point of view, it cannot but redound moſt highly to the credit of the writer. The cauſe of literature has never been ſupported, in a day of danger and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon principles more excellent, or with powers better adapted to their object. The author of this Poem may claim the character of a Noble Patriot in Literature, of a man, whoſe Piety and Orthodoxy, are an Ornament to Human Nature and the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Faith; of a Politician, whoſe ſentiments and example are an Honour to the Government and Miniſtry under which he lives; of a Scholar, whoſe attainments are of Firſt-Rate Excellence; and of a Satiriſt, whoſe keeneſt arrow is always directed by the hand of a Gentleman. The few falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and falſe judgements which this poem contains are trifling indeed, when compared with its nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous merits. The various and extenſive learning exhibited in the Notes, is conveyed in ſo lively a manner as to delight almoſt every reader. More

                  <p>Hiſtoriographer we believe to the Eaſt India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and a very learned, ingenious, and diligent Scholar. He was educated at Univerſity College, Oxford, afterward became Chaplain to the 97th Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and lived for ſome years at Woodford, in Eſſex. He publiſhed, in 1779, a quarto volume of "Poems and Miſcellaneous Pieces," with a free Tranſlation of the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles. Moſt of theſe poems had appeared in print before, ſeparately; "Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therby," the oldeſt of them, was publiſhed in 1776. They poſſeſs much merit, but did not obtain their author that credit which his latter writings have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him. About a year, previouſly to this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, Mr. Maurice had printed a Faſt Sermon, which we believe is his only publication in the claſs of divinity. In 1782, he wrote <hi>Ierne Rediviva,</hi> an
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0102600102:36"/>
ode, inſcribed to the Volunteers of Ireland; and, two years afterward, "Weſtminſter Abbey," an elegiac poem, both of which pieces increaſed his reputation as a poet. In 1789, Mr. Maurice pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Panthea, a tragedy, from a ſtory in Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, which did not add greatly to his fame; and relinquiſhing here the line of authorſhip, which he had hitherto traced, he has ſince acquired the greateſt eminence and diſtinction, in another track. This is a circumſtance which cannot but appear ſurpriſing; for what reader, with all his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. Maurice's abilities as an hiſtorian, can help yielding the palm to his poetical talents? In the year 1790, he publiſhed a Letter addreſſed to the Directors of the Eaſt India Company, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſals for printing a Hiſtory of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Empire of Hindoſtan, from the earlieſt Ages; and has, ſince that time, publiſhed "Indian Antiquities," in ſix volumes, octavo (the two firſt of which appeared in 1793) and the firſt volume (in quarto) of the Hiſtory of Hindoſtan, publiſhed in 1795. The former of theſe works is introductory to and illuſtrative of the latter. Although it was ſanctioned by the approbation of the Eaſt India Company and Sir William Jones, it obtained only <hi>a dozen</hi> ſubſcribers in the courſe of twelve months! At preſent, however, the merit of the author of theſe works is well known to the public, and has obtained him a moſt diſtinguiſhed reputation. His erudition, diligence, and ingenuity are very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

                  <p>This literary Veteran has been diſtinguiſhed for more than fifty years, as one of the moſt elegant ſcholars and claſſical writers of his time. Few au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have contributed ſo much to the improvement of our ſtyle, or have exhibited, in their works, ſuch complete models of elegant writing, ſuch ſpecimens of correct choice and perſpicuous arrangement of words, and of harmonious conſtruction of periods. Mr. Melmoth is a ſon of the late eminent Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the ſame name, who wrote an admirable treatiſe on the great importance of a Religious Life. He died in 1743, and it is ſaid of him, 'few ever paſſed a more uſeful, none a more blameleſs life.' The firſt publication of the ſubject of this article was "The Letters of Sir Thomas Fitzoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, on ſeveral Subjects," in an octavo volume. Theſe admired Letters made their firſt appearance about the year 1742, and have experienced that favourable reception and general circulation, to which their very ſterling merit entitles them. Mr. Melrmoth's elegant Tranſlation of Pliny's Epiſtles made its firſt appearance, in two octavo volumes, in 1747, about four years before the Tranſlation by the Earl of Orrery, to which it was juſtly preferred. In 1753, he publiſhed, in three octavo volumes, a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of Cicero's Letters to his Friends, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0102600102:40"/>
in which the <hi>patriot character</hi> ofth a celebrated Roman is juſtly queſtioned; and, in 1773 and 1777, Tranſlations of Cicero's Cato and Laelius, each in an octavo volume, with Remarks. Theſe finiſhed performances have acquired Mr. Melmoth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reputation poſſible, as an elegant and accurate ſcholar. They will probably ſpeak for him while Roman and Engliſh eloquence can be united. Yet, when we conſider them as ſpecimens of tranſlation, we cannot help thinking, that he is too often led away by the vanity of improving upon his author, that he frequently ſacrifices his original to a falſe refinement and an overſpun delicacy of phraſe, and laſtly, that he has too much of what the Greeks expreſs by the forcible term <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.

The grounds of this attack were Mr. Melmoth's remarks in his Tranſlation of Pliny's Letters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Trajan's perſecution of the Chriſtians in Bythinia, and he wrote a pamphlet in Anſwer to Mr. Bryant, in which he vindicated himſelf with great ability, and proved his point. Two years after this, Mr. Melmoth publiſhed, "Memoirs of a late eminent Advocate" (his father), in a thin octavo volume; which is a tribute of filial piety, not leſs elegant than merited.</p>

An Ode on the Recovery of his Majeſty, recited by Mrs. Siddons at a Gala given by the Subſcribers to Brookes' Club, as well as a comic-opera, entitled, "The Magician no Conjuror," acted four nights in the winter of 1792, are alſo to be attributed to his pen. On the 29th of June, 1787, Mr. Merry ſent a pretty little poem, entitled, the Adieu and Recall to Love, to the World, a newſpaper of the day, with the ſignature Della Cruſca. It was anſwered by a poem, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, the Pen, ſigned Anna Matilda. The corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence thus begun, was from poetical ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy kept up, at intervals, for two years. Many new correſpondents came forward, but the writers remained long unknown to the public and to one another. Time, at laſt, diſcovered Della Cruſca and Anna Matilda, to be Mr. Merry and Mrs. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon, who had an interview toward the concluſion of the correſpondence. In the mean time the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, ſome of which is very pretty, attracted a good deal of notice, and was reprinted, in volumes, under the title of "The Poetry of the World." It has now reached a fourth edition, in two duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0102600102:43"/>
volumes, entitled, "The Britiſh Album." Mr. Merry's pieces, in this collection, have the greateſt claim to diſtinction of any. His poem, "Diverſity" and "Ambitions Vengeance," a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic-drama, are to be found in theſe volumes. In ſpeaking of Mr. Merry's pretenſions to ſame, as a poet, we muſt obſerve that he has been loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried and ſtigmatiſed by an elegant ſatiriſt of the preſent day, (vide William Gifford, Eſq.) who has ſaid of one of his pieces<note n="*" place="bottom">The Laurel of Liberty.</note> that it is diſtinguiſhed by "Downright nonſenſe, Downright frigidity, and downright doggerel." We own that his falſe glitter, his negligence, and his obſcurity are frequently highly reprehenſible, yet, cannot but allow, that his pretenſions to poetical merit are often great and ſtriking, while the ſpirit of liberty and benevolence which breathes through his writings ſeems ardent and ſincere. His poem, entitled, "The Pains of Memory," has been preferred by many readers, to Mr. Rogers' popular poem "The Pleaſures of Memory."</p>

and ſtrength of character, which entitle him to the higheſt admiration as a citizen of that community. ford, and has beſtowed much time and attention on his favourite ſtudy of antiquities. His chief work, the Hiſtory of Greece, is a performance which does him infinite credit. To thoſe who are acquainted with the intricacy of many parts of Grecian Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, with the extreme difficulty of collecting the ſcattered members of it, of detecting the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious and doubtful among what is related by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior or later authors, and of aſcertaining and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging the genuine; and laſtly, without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of invention, of forming, from parts ſo broken and diſperſed, a harmonizing whole, he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear highly to deſerve the character of a learned and accurate hiſtorian. His Hiſtory of Greece is not the work of a cloſet critic, or a monkiſh phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher; but owes its exiſtence to a moſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive mind and correct judgement, happily blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extenſive knowledge, and an acquaintance with the modes and manners of life. He frequently and his union of characters, ſoldier, ſeaman, ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſcholar, poet, and philoſopher; while his juſt eſtimation of <hi>his</hi> invaluable guides Thucydides and Xenophon, increaſes our admiration of the ſoldier-philoſopher who is our own. Much of the earlier part of this valuable work was written in camps and in quarters during the American war. It was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0102600102:51"/>
firſt publiſhed by ſingle quarto volumes, of which the firſt appeared in 1784, two years previous to the Hiſtory by Dr. Gillies (vide that name). At preſent three of theſe volumes are publiſhed, and the third edition was printed in octavo, each of the original volumes forming two of theſe. Ten years previous to the firſt appearance of this work, Mr. Mitford had publiſhed, anonymouſly, an Eſſay upon to illuſtrate that of the Engliſh Language; and, in 1791, he wrote a pamphlet, entitled, "Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Opinion ſtated by the Lords of the Committee of Council, in a Repreſentation to the King, upon the Corn Laws, that Great Britain is unable to produce Corn ſufficient for its own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, &amp;c."</p>

Yet, the ſtyle of Mr. Mitford can certainly not be ſaid to poſſeſs that grace and poliſh, which would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play to moſt advantage the many excellencies of his writings. With the generality of readers, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſtyle are of the higheſt conſideration.

Two years after this, he wrote a View of Society and Manners in Italy, which, as the obſervations it contains oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the ſame tour, ſo is it to be conſidered as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0102600102:58"/>
a continuation of the above work, in merit, as well as ſubject. Theſe volumes have ſeen ſeveral edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſince their firſt publication. In 1786, Dr. Moore publiſhed an octavo volume of "Medical Sketches;" and, three years afterward, his cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated novel, entitled, "Zeluco," in two volumes, octavo. Dr. Moore accompanied the Earl of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale to Paris, in 1792, and was preſent during the horrid maſſacre of the 2d of September. Soon after his return to England, he publiſhed a Journal dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Reſidence in France, in two volumes, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavo, which is a moſt valuable and authentic work; and, in 1795, he produced a View of the Cauſes and Progreſs of the French Revolution, in two more octavo volumes. He has, ſince that time, written Edward, a novel, in two octavo volumes, which, like Zeluco, exhibits various views of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, but its characters are more indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to our own ſoil. It is hardly neceſſary for us to add of ſo popular a writer as Mr. Moore, that his works diſcover him to poſſeſs great inſight into human nature, and that happy union of acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, with a lively imagination, by which he is enabled to deſcribe its intricacies with the greateſt pleaſantry.</p>

                  <head>MORE, HANNAH.</head>
                  <p>Formerly a School-miſtreſs at Briſtol, and a lady juſtly celebrated for her literary accompliſhments. The elegant ſimplicity of her poems, and the pious and virtuous ſentiments which they inculcate, come with peculiar grace from a female pen. Her firſt publication was a paſtoral drama, entitled, "The Search of Happineſs," which appeared in 1773. It was written at the age of eighteen for ſome female friends, who played the reſpective characters in private parties. Though the plot of this little piece is perfectly inartificial, the poetry which it contains does infinite credit to the powers of ſuch early years, and it experienced a very favourable reception. In the following year, Mrs. More pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Inflexible Captive, founded on the ſtory of Regulus, an excellent tragedy conſidered as a literary compoſition, and which was acted one night at Bath. Sir Eldred of the Bower, and the Bleeding Rock, two beautiful legendary tales, were publiſhed together, in quarto, in 1776. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in the manner of Ovid, and the pretty fiction at the concluſion had its origin from a rock, near the author's reſidence in Somerſetſhire, whence a crimſon ſtream flows, occaſioned by the red ſtrata over which the water makes its way from the mountains. Mrs. More has alſo. written an Ode
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0102600102:61"/>
to Dragon, Mr. Garrick's Houſe-Dog; Eſſays on various Subjects, principally deſigned for young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, an octavo volume; the tragedy of Percy, founded on the Gabrielle de Vergy of M. de Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy; the Fatal Falſehood, a tragedy; Sacred Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, the ſubjects of which are taken from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Senſibility, a poem; Florio and the Bas Bleu, two poems; Slavery, a poem; and Remarks on the Speech of M. Dupont, made in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Convention of France, on the Subjects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and public Education. The profits of the laſt of theſe publications were to be given to the French emigrant clergy. Each of theſe performances bears genuine marks of the ſterling abilities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of their author. United, they entitle her to high eminence, indeed, among female writers. Mrs. More wrote the preface to Anne Yearſley's (the Briſtol Milk-maid) poems, and is ſuppoſed to be concerned in ſeveral little pieces diſtributed among the poor, by a ſociety under the active patronage of the worthy Biſhop of London. The uſeful lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tract, "An Eſtimate of the Religion of the Faſhionable World," is alſo attributed to her.</p>

He publiſhed, in 1779, "The Doctrine of Annuities and Aſſurances on Lives and Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorſhips," in an octavo volume, which is a very ingenious performance. About a year after this, he was engaged in a philoſophical controverſy with Dr. Adair Crawford on the ſubject of Animal Heat, and wrote a pamphlet, entitled, "An Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion" of that gentleman's Theory. In 1792, he publiſhed a Review of Dr. Price's Writings on the Subject of the Finances of this Kingdom, in an octavo pamphlet, which has been reprinted. Mr. Morgan has, ſince that time written, "Facts," addreſſed to the ſerious attention of the people, reſpecting the expence of the War and the ſtate of the national Debt; "Additional Facts," on the ſame ſubject; and "An Appeal" to the people on the alarming ſtate of the public Finances and public Credit. In theſe pamphlets Mr. Morgan has made many very queſtionable poſitions, and has, throughout, ſtrained every nerve of his ingenuity, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of public affairs, to become a moſt terrifying alarmiſt.

                  <p>This nobleman is an adherent to the popular cauſe in the Iriſh Houſe of Lords, and has paid a good deal of attention to the politics of this country. He has ſhewn a Very commendable zeal in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of political and hiſtorical knowledge. In 1774, his Lordſhip was an unſucceſsful candidate with Lord Viſcount Mahon, ſince Earl Stanhope, for the City of Weſtminſter; and, in 1784, he made ſeveral Speeches againſt the Coalition, in the popular meetings of the electors of that city. He took an active and able part, in the Houſe of Lords of Ireland, in the year 1789, upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the addreſs to the Prince of Wales.

                  <p>A dramatic writer, peculiarly adapted for the age in which he lives. He is a native of Durham, was a cotemporary with Mr. Holman at Soho School, and was deſigned for the Law. With this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0102600102:68"/>
view he was entered at Lincoln's Inn, but has never been called to the bar. His maiden-offering to the ſtage, was a comic Song in Mr. Reynolds' comedy of Notoriety. He has, ſince that time, written Columbus, an hiſtorical play; the Children in the Wood, a farce; Zorinſki; the Way to get Married; and a Cure for the Heart Ache, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The firſt of theſe pieces was publiſhed in 1792. It is a queer compound, and was vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently accuſed, upon its firſt appearance, by Mr. Thelwall, as a ſhameful plagiariſm from an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical opera, entitled, "The Incas, or the Peruvian Virgin," which he had offered, without ſucceſs, to Mr. Harris, nine months previouſly. Zorinſki has alſo been accuſed as a plagiariſm from Brooke's Guſtavus Vaſa. Mr. Morton's "Cure for the Heart Ache," is, in our opinion, the beſt of his dramatic pieces. They have, many of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced conſiderable favour from the public, and have raiſed their author to the character of a very ſucceſsful modern play-writer. As to their <hi>abſolute</hi> merit, however, we muſt obſerve, that, although they have been approved in an age, in which dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic compoſition is at a moſt melancholy ebb; in which our plays wear no longer the ſtamp of real life, neither does their colouring ſhew the breathing vivacity of original obſervation; in which the ſtrongeſt effort of dramatic ſatire is, to make an actor who is endowed with particular talents, laugh before his audience at a reigning eccentricity, and

not, as formerly, perſonate the character to which it is peculiar; and in which an eternal repitition of ſome contemptible vulgarity, is to ſupply the places of wit and brilliancy: yet, their exiſtence, we muſt hope, is eminently precarious; for ſhould a tolerable taſte ever again favour a Britiſh audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, poſterity ſhall with difficulty credit, that ſuch plays were <hi>heard,</hi> and, with ſtill greater difficulty, that they were applauded.</p>

                  <p>Barriſter at Law, and a gentleman who has long been highly and juſtly eſteemed as an elegant Scholar. He was the intimate friend of Dr. Samuel Johnſon, many years previous to his death, and has done real ſervice to the character and memory of that celebrated genius, by becoming the editor of his works and his biographer. He has alſo been honoured with the intimate friendſhip of Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Sir Francis Blake Delaval, and Mr. Foote. Mr. Murphy was warmly engaged, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the preſent reign, in the party of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0102600102:72"/>
Earl of Bute, and was, upon that account, expoſed to the ridicule of Wilkes and Churchill. Early in life he made an attempt upon the ſtage, and is ſeverely ſatiriſed in the Roſciad, particularly for his ill-ſucceſs in the character of Othello. As an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Mr. Murphy made his firſt appearance in the Gray's-Inn Journal, a periodical paper, begun in 1752, and which was continued for two years. This paper contains many ingenious eſſays, which are collected, in two octavo volumes, in the edition of his works, and was the origin of Mr. Murphy's acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Dr. Johnſon. For, being at a friend's houſe in the country, and not diſpoſed to loſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for buſineſs, he took up a French <hi>Journal Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raire,</hi> and tranſlating ſomething he liked, ſent it to his bookſeller. Time diſcovered that he had tranſlated from the French, a Rambler, which had been taken from the Engliſh without acknowledgement; and his ſubſequent apology to Dr. Johnſon, gave birth to a laſting friendſhip. Mr. Murphy's moſt numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pieces, however, are in the dramatic line of compoſition. He began with producing three farces, in 1756, viz. the Apprentice, the Spouter, and the Engliſhman from Paris. The laſt of theſe pieces was only acted one night, and has never reached the preſs. He has, ſince that time, written for the ſtage, the Upholſterer, a farce; the Orphan of China, a tragedy, tranſlated from Voltaire; the Deſert Iſland, a dramatic tale; the Way to Keep Him, and All in the Wrong, comedies; the Old
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0102600102:73"/>
Maid, and the Citizen, farces; No Man's Enemy but his Own, and the School for Guardians, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies: Zenobia, the Grecian Daughter, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuma, tragedies, of which the firſt is tranſlated from Crebillon; News from Parnaſſus, a prelude; Know your Own Mind, and the Choice, comedies; and Three Weeks after Marriage, a farce. Theſe pieces were printed ſeparately at the time of their firſt appearance, and have ſince been collected in the edition of Mr. Murphy's works, in ſeven oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavo volumes, publiſhed in 1786. They have, many of them, conſiderable pretenſions to merit. The moſt diſtinguiſhed are, probably, the Grecian Daughter, and Three Weeks after Marriage; which laſt, had been moſt capriciouſly condemned under its firſt title, viz. "What we must All Come To." In the above-mentioned edition of his works is alſo to be found the Rival Siſters, a tragedy, which Mr. Murphy never offered to the ſtage; and ſome ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Poems, a few of which had been publiſhed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately. Some elegant Tranſlations from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, into Latin verſe, which are given in this edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do the higheſt honour to Mr. Murphy's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; among them, the tranſlation of Gray's Elegy is eminently beautiful. The firſt ſpecimen of his ſkill at biographical writing was a copious and moſt entertaining Eſſay on the Life and Genius of Henry Fielding, prefixed to the edition of that author's works, which was publiſhed in 1762. About five years afterward, he publiſhed in a duodecimo volume,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0102600102:74"/>
a moſt excellent Tranſlation of Marmontel's Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. Neither of theſe productions are to be found in the ſeven-volume edition of Mr. Murphy's works. His writings ſince the publication of that edition have been, "Seventeen Hundred and Ninety-one," a poem, in imitation of the thirteenth Satire of Juvenal, of which Johnſon, after giving us his noble imitations of the third and tenth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, ſaid he wiſhed <hi>this</hi> Satire alſo was done; an Eſſay on the Life and Genius of Dr. Johnſon, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in an octavo volume, in 1792, and prefixed to Mr. Murphy's edition of Dr. Johnſon's Works, in twelve volumes, octavo; and a Tranſlation of the Works of Tacitus, publiſhed in 1793, in four quarto volumes.</p>
                  <p>As the Biographer of Dr. Johnſon, we feel little heſitation in giving Mr. Murphy the firſt place among the many who have aſpired to that character. His ſhort Eſſay is the production of a writer who has duly weighed, and rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that judicious uniformity of colouring, which, while it gratifies the reader's curioſity, never fails to hold, in its juſt light, the object which it repreſents; and, while we have been diſguſted with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent prattle which, by ſome writers, has been ſo freely expended upon this virtuous and wiſe, though partial and auſtere character, we find, in this Eſſay, a manlineſs and propriety of conduct, which can always keep up in our minds an intereſt in his behalf, without ever forfeiting the dignity of its
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0102600102:75"/>
object. His opinions upon the writings of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor are highly judicious, and moſt honourable to his critical talents, and his edition of Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Works, clearly entitles him to the ſame place among the Editors of that great character, which we have given him among his biographers. As a Tranſlator of Tacitus, Mr. Murphy will find moſt favour from thoſe who are moſt acquainted with the peril of his ſituation. The celebrated Mr. Gray, in one of his Letters, declares that he found himſelf, after making an attempt, unequal to the taſk of giving Tacitus a becoming dreſs in our language. A better judge than Mr. Gray of ſuch an undertaking, will not eaſily be found. We are ſorry that we can ſay nothing in praiſe of Mr. Murphy's laborious work. The freedom of his tranſlation, appears to us, the leading circumſtance againſt his ſucceſs. But, when we add, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding every licence of this kind, the Engliſh work he has afforded us, is far from an elegant compoſition; can we ſay that he has kept any meaſures with juſtice, in the execution of his taſk? The merit, however, of his original writings, will ſuperſede every unfavourable impreſſion of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate attempt, and gain his writings a laſting diſtinction among the works of taſte. It is ſaid that he has been for ſome time engaged in writing the Life of his friend Foote. Few are ſo equal to the taſk of doing juſtice to the Engliſh Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes.</p>

                  <p>A well-known Dramatic Writer, who has had the misfortune to be blind for ſome years. He is a native of Ireland, was originally deſigned for a painter, and was, for ſome time, a performer upon the Dublin Theatre. Before he came to England, he produced, about 1767, at Smock-Alley Theatre,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0102600102:92"/>
a farce, entitled, "The She-Gallant," which was afterward altered for Covent Garden Theatre, under the title of the Poſitive Man. His ſecond piece was Tony Lumpkin in Town, a farce, firſt acted at Dublin, and brought out at the Haymarket, in 1778. The chronological liſt of his numerous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent pieces, produced at the London Theatres, is as follows, viz. the Son in Law, a farce; the Dead Alive, a farce, from a ſtory in the Arabian Nights; the Agreeable Surpriſe, a farce; the Banditti, a comic opera; the Poſitive Man, a farce; the Caſtle of Andaluſia, altered from the Banditti; Lord Mayor's Day, a ſpeaking Pantomine; the Maid the Miſtreſs, a burletta, from the Italian of La Serva Padrona; the Sham-rock, a comic opera; the Young Quaker, a comedy, one of the principal circumſtances in which was taken from Smollet's Count Fathom; the Birth Day, or the Prince of Arragon; the Poor Soldier, a comic opera, altered from the Sham-rock; Friar Bacon, a pantomine; Peeping Tom, a muſical farce; Fontainbleau, a comic opera; the Blackſmith of Antwerp, a farce; a Beggar on Horſeback, a dramatic proverb; Omai, a pantomine; Love in a Camp, a comic opera; the Siege of Curzola, a comic opera; the Man-Milliner, a farce; the Farmer, a farce; Tantara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara, a farce, from the French; the Priſoner at Large, a farce; a Key to the Lock, a farce; the Highland Reel, a comic romance; the Czar, a comic open; the Little Hunch-Back, a farce;

Modern Antiques, a farce; Wild Oats, a comedy; Sprigs of Laurel, a comic opera; the London Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, a comedy; the World in a Village, a comedy; Life's Vagaries, a comedy; the Iriſh Mimic, a muſical farce; and the Doldrum, a farce. Some of theſe pieces have been withdrawn from the ſtage, and many of them have continued favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites with the public. They have all reached the preſs except the Son in Law; and, with a poems, entitled, "Oatlands," which was printed in 1795, conſtitute the liſt of Mr. O'Keefe's publications. As a dramatic writer, this gentleman has, perhaps, for ſome years, croſſed the meridian of his glory, His plays are, for the moſt part, characteriſed by broad humour, without purity of diction or wit of dialogue; and by a neglect of plot, probability, and, often, common-ſenſe. He has, perhaps, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed his ſhare to the introduction of that vitiated taſte, in dramatic compoſition, which, at preſent, ſo lamentably prevails. He has contrived, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to pleaſe many, and he who pleaſes many muſt have merit.</p>

ſong, Paine entered the liſts, obtained the laurel and was preſented with three guineas. This, we believe, was his firſt public appearance as an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. in the year following, a deſign having been formed by the exciſe officers throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to apply to Parliament for a conſideration of the ſtate of their ſalaries, he wrote <hi>their caſe,</hi> in an octavo pamphlet of twenty-one pages, which was republiſhed in London a few years ago. Having been diſcovered, as a grocer to deal in exciſeable articles, and as a grinder of ſnuff to buy ſmuggled tobacco, he was diſmiſſed from the exciſe in 1774, after twelve years ſervice. In the mean time, Paine, by his <hi>Caſe of the Exciſemen,</hi> and by his plauſibility of manner, had attracted the notice of the late Mr. George Lewis Scott, commiſſioner of exciſe. This gentleman recommended him ſtrongly to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Dr. Benjamin Franklin, as a perſon who could be ſerviceable, at that time, in America; and Paine ſet ſail for Pennſylvania, in September, 1774, upon a letter of introduction to Governor Franklin of the Jerſeys. It was two years after this, that he attracted great notice by the publication of his pamphlet, entitled, "Common Senſe." De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as this production was, to ridicule and expoſe the abſurdity of monarchical Government, it proved highly palatable to the republican taſte of the United States. It has been called one of thoſe few literary performances, which have been known to produce a great and ſudden effect upon the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0102600102:99"/>
and conduct of a nation; and, having been publiſhed at a very critical period, the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the American war, ſerved more than any thing elſe to induce the inhabitants of that country to an immediate declaration of independence. At the latter end of the ſame year (1776) he began to publiſh, in the Pennſylvania Journal, "The Criſis," a periodical eſſay, which appeared as often, during the continuance of hoſtilities, as his idea of the ſtate of affairs required. The congreſs, at firſt, managed their European concerns by a committee for ſecret correſpondence, but their demands for European aid becoming more urgent, the Secret Committee was converted into a Committee for Foreign Affairs. Paine, who was now becoming a celebrated character in the United States, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Secretary to this Committee, but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in retailing through the newſpapers what he confidentially knew from the foreign correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he was forced to reſign that office. Soon after this, he obtained the degree of M. A. from the Univerſity of Pennſylvania, was choſen a Member of the American Philoſophical Society; and, when the Congreſs had rejected him as unworthy of truſt, the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania, which had been purged of Quakers by his pen, thought him fit for its Clerk. In 1782, he printed at Philadelphia, a Letter to the Abbé Raynal on the Affairs of North America, in which he undertook to correct and clear up the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in the Abbé's Account of the Revolution. A
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0102600102:100"/>
little later in the ſame year, and at the ſame place, he alſo printed, a Letter to the Earl of Shelburne, on his Speech in Parliament, July 10th, 1782, in which the noble Earl had ſaid, that, <q>When Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhall acknowledge American Independence, the ſun of Britain's glory is ſet for ever.</q> Both of theſe Letters were, ſhortly afterward, reprinted in London. In the Autumn of 1786, Paine left America, with the intention of going to France, and arrived at Paris early in 1787, having left no great ſhare of popularity behind him. His ſtay here was ſhort, and he reached London in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn of the ſame year. Before the concluſion of 1787, he publiſhed a pamphlet upon the recent tranſactions between Great Britain and Holland, entitled, "Proſpects on the Rubicon," in which he cenſured the meaſures of the Engliſh Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>We come now to that period in Paine's Hiſtory, when his ſpeculations were to ſhake the fabric of the public mind to its very foundation, and his writings to infuſe a poiſon among a deluded com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, the effects of which, to a philoſopher in the ſhade, would have been ſcarcely credible. Being releaſed, in November, 1789, from a ſponging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, into which a debt, contracted by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of erecting an Iron Bridge, had brought him; he beheld, with delight, the proceedings of that memorable year in France, and haſtened to that country. Soon, however, he recroſſed the channel,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0102600102:101"/>
and, in his road to London, encountered Mr. Burke's far-famed pamphlet, which appeared a few days before the celebration of the French Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, November 5th, 1790. A few months la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour produced Part I. of the "Rights of Man." It was ſubmitted to the reviſal of Mr. Brand Hollis and a democratic Committee; and, after ſome ſtruggles, between the deſires of the author and the wiſhes of his patrons, was committed by them to the preſs. In February 1791, it was printed for Johnſon, in St. Paul's Church Yard, but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for <hi>the credit of his ſhop,</hi> induced him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the ſale, and a delay of a month in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication thus took place. A few copies were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſmuggled into private hands, and, at length, on the 13th of March, 1791, it was publiſhed by Jordan, in Fleet Street, with a Dedication to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington. The apprehenſions of Paine, upon this occaſion, ſeem to have been very great. Always ready to take wing for France, he fluttered with anxiety about the Metropolis. At length, finding that the Miniſtry, truſting to the good ſenſe of the people, gave itſelf no concern about him, he took a lodging in Fetter Lane, (where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till his final departure) and immediately went to work at Part II. of the "Rights of Man." This was publiſhed by Jordan, early in 1792. It is well known that the Jacobin Societies took the utmoſt pains to diſtribute cheap editions of this work, over the whole nation, particularly in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactories,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0102600102:102"/>
and among the labouring poor. It is even ſaid, that tobacco, grocery, and ſweet-meats for children, were frequently ſold in wrappers of its ſheets! Many Anſwers to the two Parts were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at the preſs, and at the anniverſary meeting of the Conſtitutional Society, on the 13th of April, 1792, the Members of theſe Jacobin Societies were ſtated to exceed forty thouſand perſons! Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, at length, became alarmed. Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were commemced, in May, 1792, againſt Paine, as the author, and Jordan as the publiſher of "Rights of Man." The royal proclamation was iſſued, ſtating that ſeditious writings had been induſtriouſly diſperſed for inciting diſcontent, and warning all magiſtrates to be diligent in ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing tumult and preſerving quiet. Both Houſes of Parliament declared their abhorrence of writings, which had anarchy for their end, and proclaimed their unalterable reſolution to maintain the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the laws. The City of London avowed her loyalty to the King, and her attachment to the conſtitution. The other corporations followed the example of the metropolis; and the county-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings joined in the general abhorrence of innovation, and in the univerſal determination to ſupport the wiſe ſyſtem of policy, which had been tranſmitted by the wiſdom of their anceſtors. Paine was now employed in writing thoſe Letters for the ARGUS, which were afterward diſtributed from the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet-ſhops under the title of "Paine's four Letters
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0102600102:103"/>
on Government." Shortly afterward, he produced a pamphlet, conſiſting of two Letters to Lord On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlow, and one to Mr. Dundas; and another pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, containing, "A Letter to the Addreſſers on the late Proclamation," the great object of which was, to procure a National Convention in contempt of the Parliament. He was, at the ſame time, readily adopted as a proper citizen, by a country which had recently plunged into the depths of anarchy; and, when the Jacobin Clubs were about to form a Convention at Paris of turbulent ſpirits from every quarter of the world, ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments contended for the honour of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the celebrated Thomas Paine. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais bore away the <hi>glorious</hi> prize from all her competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſhe ſent citizen Audibert to ſignify his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and to ſolicit his acceptance of it. He required little ſolicitation; and quitting London on the 13th of September, 1792, was received with open arms on the following day, on the ſhores of Calais. He was tried by a ſpecial jury at Guildhall, and convicted as a malignant libeller; and, ſoon afterward, his effigy and his books were burned in almoſt every village in England. His conviction made him an outlaw, and, having joined the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention at Paris, in a declaration of war againſt Great Britain, he has, ſince that time, become a traitor. Amid the changes of Government in France, Paine did not eſcape notice, and when Robeſpierre began to gain an aſcendancy, he was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0102600102:104"/>
ſent, with Anacharſis Cloots, to the priſon at Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg. He, however, eſcaped the Guillotine, and during his confinement, compoſed his work, entitled, "The Age of Reaſon," Part I. of which was publiſhed in London, in 1794, and Part II. in the year following. This work naturally produced ſeveral Anſwers at the preſs, among which the "Apology for the Bible," by the Biſhop of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff, is to be moſt eminently diſtinguiſhed. Paine's ſubſequent writings have been, a Diſſertation on the firſt Principles of Government; "The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and Fall of the Engliſh Syſtem of Finance;" a moſt impudent Letter to General Waſhington; and "Agrarian Juſtice oppoſed to Agrarian Law and to Agrarian Monopoly," all pamphlets.</p>
                  <p>The abuſe which has been ſo liberally beſtowed upon Paine, as a writer, has, perhaps, for the moſt part, been the reſult of a zeal whoſe tendency is to weaken, more than to ſupport, its cauſe. Let us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allow him, the qualified credit of an animated, energetic writer, who diſplays conſiderable acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but whoſe manner of thinking is rude, wicked and daring, and whoſe language is vulgar though impreſſive. Let us rather rejoice, that Engliſhmen, with their juſt veneration for civil liberty and the rights of the people, were found ſo wiſe and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in an hour of danger, as to deſpiſe thoſe ſorry calculators, that would perſuade a country, whoſe conſtitution has raiſed her to be the envy of all the civilized world, to hazard that conſtitution upon
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0102600102:105"/>
the groſſeſt, clumſieſt, and ſtaleſt theories. Let us be thankful that the Arch-theoriſt of the Rights of Man, of thoſe rights which transfer the reins from his paſſion to his reaſon, of thoſe rights which diſſolve ties, which confound diſtinctions, which deſtroy ſecurity, could play upon us with his new lights upon human governments, without dazzling our reaſon, or impairing our eye-ſight. Finally let us rejoice, that when this wily and audacious Anarch dared, at laſt, to attack the ſacred volume of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, there was found, on our bench of Biſhops a learned and philoſophical Prelate, condeſcending enough and active enough to oppoſe them nobly and completely, by his erudition, his clearneſs, and his ſtrength of argument.</p>

                  <p>Archdeacon of Carliſle, &amp;c. A moſt venerable and diſtinguiſhed character as a ſound Reaſoner, a well-read Scholar, and an excellent Divine. He was educated at Chriſt's College, Cambridge, took his degree of Batchelor of Arts, with great diſtinction, in 1763, and afterward, became tutor of the above ſociety. His works have experienced that brilliant ſucceſs to which their very extraordinary value entitles them. The first of them (excepting ſingle Sermons) was his highly celebrated "Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Moral and Political Philoſophy," which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0102600102:106"/>
was firſt publiſhed in a quarto volume, in 1785, and has ſince been very frequently reprinted, with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and improvements, in two octavo volumes. It is hardly poſſible to ſay too much in favour of this treatiſe. The ripeſt ſchoolman may read it with inſtruction and delight, while it contains amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the moſt volatile fancy. It has obtained its author one diſtinction among others, ſingularly glorious, and, moſt probably, unparallelled. We mean the circumſtance of its chapters, being very frequently ſubjects for diſputation in the Schools of one of our Univerſities, at the ſame time with ſections of the immortal Principia of Newton, or with chapters of the celebrated Eſſay of Locke. Thus the diſtinguiſhed honours which ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent characters are proud to receive after death, are conferred on Dr. Paley while alive! The ſtyle of this work is admirably adapted to its ſubject, and is, perhaps, one of the beſt models for the imitation of youth, which can be found in our language; while the fine reaſoning, the pertinency of illuſtration, the ſtrong integrity of judgement, and the great comprehenſion of mind which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it, may be fit objects of its emulation, provided it duly eſtimate the labour of thought, and application neceſſary to ſuch acquiſitions, and form not, after all, too ſanguine hopes of reaching ſuch perfection. Some Remarks upon this work have been written by Mr. Giſborne, for an account of which, we refer the reader to our memoir of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0102600102:107"/>
that gentleman. Beſide this production. Dr. Paley has publiſhed ſeveral ſingle Sermons, preached on particular occaſions and before the Univerſity of Cambridge; "Horae Paulinae; or, the Truth of the Scripture Hiſtory of St. Paul evinced, by a Compariſon of the Epiſtles which bear his Name, with the Acts of the Apoſtles, and with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," publiſhed in an octavo volume, in 1790; and "A View of the Evidences of Chriſtianity," in three volumes, octavo, publiſhed in 1794. All theſe productions are worthy of the celebrated au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of "Principles of Moral and Political Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy." The laſt of them, in particular, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a moſt diſtinguiſhed reception. It bears in every page, the ſtrongeſt characteriſtic touches of its able and excellent writer. It is the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſummary of the evidences of Chriſtianity, that has ever appeared. It is a work moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and uſeful to his fellow-creatures, and muſt be acceptable in the ſight of his God.</p>

                  <p>Late Fellow and Tutor of Chriſt's College, Cambridge. This gentleman was a cotemporary at the Univerſity with the celebrated mathematician, Mr. Atwood.

                  <head>PARR, REV. SAMUEL, L.L.D.</head>
                  <p>A moſt elegant and profound Scholar, very highly celebrated for his knowledge of the Greek language. He was originally one of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters of Harrow School, and in that ſituation had the honour of ſharing in the education, among others, of Mr. Richard Brinſley Sheridan. Upon a vacancy in the headmaſterſhip, in 1770, Dr. Parr became a candidate for that office, and his cauſe was ſo warmly, eſpouſed by many of the boys of the ſchool, as to occaſion very turbulent proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Proving unſucceſsful, he retired to a village at a ſmall diſtance from Harrow, and opened a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0102600102:113"/>
ſchool, to which he was followed by many of the Harrow ſcholars. Dr. Parr was afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, by the Earl of Dartmouth, to ſuperintend the education of his eldeſt ſon, Lord Viſcount Lewiſham, in conſequence of which he reſigned his ſchool, and fixed his reſidence at Colcheſter, where he was attended by his Lordſhip, and one or two more pupils. At the expiration of this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was choſen Maſter of the Free School at Norwich, which he conducted with great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and has now been ſettled, for ſome years, in the neighbourhood of Warwick, in the occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of educating private pupils.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Parr's firſt publications were, Sermons preached at Norwich during the American war. Of theſe, two appeared with his name in 1780, and a third, a Faſt Sermon, under the name <hi>Phileleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Norfolcienſis,</hi> in the year following. The laſt of theſe is particularly excellent. In 1786, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a fourth Sermon, preached for the benefit of the Charity Schools in Norwich. It was in the year following this, that he publiſhed a new edition, in an octavo volume, of the three Books <hi>De Statu</hi> of Bellendenus, (Maſter of the Pleas to James I.) and prefixed a moſt elegant Preface. Few pieces of compoſition in Latin, have been more admired than this maſterly preface. It was reprinted, ſeparately, in the year following its firſt publication. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſists chiefly of a political retroſpect of the internal tranſactions of Britain, ſince the year 1783, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0102600102:114"/>
preſents us an animated panegyric of Lord North, Mr. Burke, and Mr. Fox, with a glowing invective againſt the methods employed to deprive them of the ſhare they held in the Government of their country. The Latin, as well as the Engliſh ſtyle of Dr. Parr, is always ſtrong, manly, and beautiful, but, perhaps, it poſſeſſes, upon the whole, leſs of grace and elegance than of energy. In 1789, Dr. Parr publiſhed "Tracts by Warburton and a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burtonian, not admitted into the Collection of their reſpective Works," in an octavo volume. Almoſt every reader will condemn the poignancy of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which is uſed in the preface to this volume, againſt the venerable Biſhop of Worceſter, while he will confeſs, with pleaſure, that the characters of Jortin, Leland, and Warburton are amply and beautifully delineated. In the year 1792, Dr. Parr publiſhed an octavo pamphlet, entitled, "A Sequel to the printed Paper <hi>lately</hi> circulated in Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, by the Rev. Charles Curtis, brother of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Curtis, a Birmingham Rector, &amp;c." which reached a ſecond edition. This was occaſioned by a ſuſpicion, that Mr. Curtis had written certain ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Letters, which were ſent to the Doctor; that he had uttered certain reflections upon him, in his pulpit diſcourſes; and that he had ſent the <hi>printed paper,</hi> which appeared <hi>(auctior et emendatior)</hi> in an evening Newſpaper. The ſame year pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Dr. Parr's celebrated and excellent Letter from Irenopolis to the Inhabitants of Eleutheropolis,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0102600102:115"/>
which is a ſerious addreſs to the diſſenters of Birm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, written, in conſequence of a report that they intended a ſecond commemoration of the French Revolution, and was publiſhed in a ſhilling pamphlet. For an account of Dr. Parr's literary aſſociation with the late Mr. Homer and Dr. Combe, relative to the publication of an Edition of Horace, we refer the reader to our memoir of the laſt-mentioned gentleman; where he will alſo ſee the occaſion which produced Dr. Parr's excellent pamphlet, entitled, "Remarks on the Statement of Dr. Charles Combe, by <hi>an occaſional Writer in the Britiſh Critic."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may very reaſonably be queſtioned whether the ſervices which Dr. Parr has done to the world have been adequate to his ability, or his knowledge. Much is to be allowed, however, for that want of leiſure and opportunity which every man of letters muſt feel, whole conſtant and neceſſary occupation is the inſtruction of youth. To the character of a profound ſcholar, though the printed teſtimonies he has afforded us may have been ſlender, none ſhall dare to diſpute his claim; and were our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining poſſeſſions of Greek and Latin authors to ſhare the fate of the celebrated Alexandrian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, we believe, that this gigantic proficient could afford us, from recollection, a very tolerable idea of Grecian and Roman literature. Of the Engliſh ſtyle of Dr. Parr it has been ſaid, that it unites the ſtrength of Johnſon with the richneſs of Burke.</p>

In the year following, Dr. Pearſon publiſhed, Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for impregnating the Buxton Water with its own and other Gaſes, in an octavo pamphlet; and, in 1794, a Tranſlation of the Table of Chemical Nomenclature, propoſed by De Guyton (formerly de Morveau), Lavoiſier, Bertholet, and De Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croy, in a quarto volume.

A preſent or Willoughby's Ornithology, made to him at the age of twelve years, firſt gave him a taſte for the ſtudy of Natural Hiſtory. Of Mr. Pennant's firſt work, his celebrated Britiſh Zoology, the firſt part made its appearance on the 1ſt of March, 1763, in Imperial folio.

Mr. Pennant's ſubſequent publications have been, Indian Zoology, formed from a fine collection of drawings of animals brought over by J. G.

                  <p>In the year 1790, Mr. Pennant determined to deſiſt from his literary labours, and Signified his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in a prefatory paragraph to his Account of London.

He is celebrated for his ſkill in the cure of perſons afflicted with inſanity, and for his activity as a member of the brotherhood of Free and Accepted Maſons. Dr. Perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ſeveral articles to the Medical Muſeum; among them are. "An Attempt to improve Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prognoſtication;" "The Caſe of a Catalepſy;" and "The Appearances on diſſecting a Woman who died of eating too much Cucumber." In 1778, he publiſhed "Methods of Cure in ſome particular Caſes of Inſanity," an octavo pamphlet; and, in 1781, Vol. I. (in octavo) of "Caſes in Midwifery," to which Vol. II. was, ſoon afterward, added. The laſt mentioned work was founded on the literary correſpondence of the late learned and ingenious Dr. Colin Mackenzie, and contains the only traits of his practice which have, hitherto, been ſubmitted to the public eye. In 1784, Dr. Perfect publiſhed an Addreſs to the Public on the Subject of Inſanity, notifying that he had opened houſes at Weſt Malling for the reception of inſane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0102600102:131"/>

Since that time, Dr. Perfect's only produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this claſs of publications, has been a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, entitled, "A remarkable Caſe of Madneſs, with the Diet and Medicines uſed in the Cure."

His firſt publication was an octavo volume, in 1781, which he entitled, <hi>Rimes.</hi> Being of opinion that uniformity of ſtanza, when protracted to any degree, muſt ever fatigue, as extinguiſhing the great ſource of all pleaſure, variety, he here adopted a ſeries of ſtanzas, in which, as in the Greek ſtrophe, antiſtrophe, and epode, the two firſt correſpond, and are ſucceeded by a third of a different meaſure. But the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with which Mr. Pinkerton here preſented the public, was by no means peculiarly engaging. In the year following he publiſhed, "Tales in Verſe," in a quarto pamphlet; and alſo two dithyrambic Odes; which are more diſtinguiſhed by harſhneſs and affected ſingularity, than by any ſpecies of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence. Mr. Pinkerton's next publication was a uſeful Eſſay on Medals, which firſt appeared, ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nymouſly, in a ſingle octavo volume, in 1784, and was enlarged to two volumes in the ſecond edition. The valuable aſſiſtance of Dr. Combe and Mr, Southgate, we believe, were afforded the author upon this occaſion. In 1786, Mr. Pinkerton pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, "Ancient Scotiſh Poems, never before in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0102600102:135"/>
Print," in two crown-octavo volumes; and, in the year following, a Diſſertation on the Origin and Progreſs of the Scythians or Goths, in an octavo volume. His ſubſequent publications have been, an Enquiry into the Hiſtory of Scotland, preceeding the Reign of Malcolm III. in two octavo volumes, publiſhed in 1789; the firſt genuine edition of Barbour's Bruce, with notes and a gloſſary, in three volumes, duodecimo, publiſhed in 1790; Scotiſh Poems, reprinted from ſcarce editions, in three octavo volumes, publiſhed in 1792; <hi>Iconogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia Scotica</hi>; or, Portraits of illuſtrious Perſons of Scotland, with ſhort Biographical Notices, Part I. II. III. IV; and the Hiſtory of Scotland from the Acceſſion of the Houſe of Stuart to that of Mary, with Appendixes of original Papers, in two vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, quarto, publiſhed in 1797. In the laſt of theſe works, Mr. Pinkerton has judiciouſly choſen the period of Scotiſh Hiſtory which remained inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated between the accurate inveſtigation of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier age, by Sir David Dalrymple, and the elegant Hiſtory of the later times, by Dr. Robertſon. He has produced a work of great merit, and, ſhould it experience the favourable reception to which we think it entitled, it is his deſign to write, upon the ſame plan, the Hiſtory of Scotland from the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Accounts to the Acceſſion of the Houſe of Stuart. Upon the whole, our opinion of Mr. Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerton as a writer is, that, notwithſtanding an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional unpleaſant appearance of vanity, pedantry,

                  <head>PIOZZI, HESTHER LYNCH.</head>
                  <p>A Lady of conſiderable notoriety in the literary world. She is the daughter of John Saliſbury Eſq. formerly of Bach-y-graig, in the county of Flint, and neice to Sir Thomas Saliſbury, who roſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable eminence as a civilian, in Doctor's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. In 1763, ſhe married the late Henry Thrale Eſq.; a diſtinguiſhed Brewer in the borough of Southwark. This excellent man, in the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his marriage, was introduced, by Mr. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, to the acquaintance of Dr. Samuel Johnſon. The intimacy of that celebrated character with this family daily increaſed, and he ſoon became an almoſt conſtant inmate of their country reſidence at Streatham. The conduct of Mr. Thrale to Dr. Johnſon, was indeed truly praiſe-worthy. His family contributed, for fifteen years, to the prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and comfort of a moſt valuable life, and when the benevolent maſter ſunk into the grave, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his kindneſs was acknowledged by the loving object of his regard, with the confeſſion that with him were buried many of his hopes and pleaſures, that the face upon which he had looked for the laſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0102600102:137"/>
time, had never been turned upon him but with reſpect and benignity, that he obtained from him many opportunities of amuſement, and turned his thoughts to him as to a refuge from misfortunes. Upon the death of Mr. Thrale, his widow finding it (as ſhe aſſerts) extremely perplexing and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to live in the ſame houſe with the Doctor, took advantage of a loſt law-ſuit to plead inability of purſe for remaining longer in London or its vicinity, and retired to Bath, where ſhe knew he would not follow her. She continued, however, to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with Dr. Johnſon, till near the time (July 1784) of her marriage to her ſecond huſband, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Piozzi, a native of Florence, and a muſic-maſter of the City of Bath; when a very warm expoſtulation, on the part of the Doctor, againſt this ſtep, diſſolved their friendſhip. Soon after her union with Mr. Piozzi, ſhe travelled with him to the place of his birth, and viſited ſeveral parts of Europe before they returned to England.</p>
                  <p>During her reſidence in Florence, in 1785, chance having brought together, at that place, a few Engliſh of both ſexes, particularly Mr. Merry, Mr. Parſons, and Mr. Greathead, they wrote, in aſſociation, "The Florence Miſcellany," a collection of pieces in proſe and verſe, of which a few copies have been printed, but it has not been publiſhed. Some ſpecimens of this flighty production appeared in a newſpaper of the day, called the World, as well as in ſeveral of the magazines: the preface
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0102600102:138"/>
was written by Mrs. Piozzi, to whom, we believe, the conduct of the work had been committed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other fugitive poetical pieces by Mrs. Piozzi, as, the Three Warnings, a tale imitated from La Fontaine; a Tranſlation of Boileau's Epiſtle to his Gardener, (firſt printed in Mrs. Williams' Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies); and a Prologue to the Royal Suppliants, have reached the public eye. Among theſe, the firſt is to be particularly diſtinguiſhed as a very maſterly production, and it has been ſtrongly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that Dr. Johnſon either wrote it, or aſſiſted in the compoſition of it. The former opinion, we think, from the ſtyle of the piece, is improbable; but that it has felt his correcting hand, we have little doubt.</p>
                  <p>The firſt regular exploit of Mrs. Piozzi in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorſhip, was made in the year 1786; when ſhe produced her crown-octavo volume of Anecdotes of Dr. Johnſon. Two years after this, ſhe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Collection of Letters to and from Dr. Johnſon, from 1765, to 1784, in two octavo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes. Her "Anecdotes," as coming from the pen of a writer who had long ſhared the ſociety and friendſhip of that illuſtrious character, were peruſed with great avidity; but time has diſſolved the charm. They bring us acquainted, it is true, with the domeſtic tranſactions, and introduce us to the private hours of the object held up to our view; yet, what of this, when, as admirers of the learning and moral excellence of their hero, we glow at
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0102600102:139"/>
almoſt every page with indignation, that his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and his failings ſhould be diſcloſed to public view? There is, ſurely, ſomething ſacred attached in every well-conſtituted mind to the memory of a character, which, beſide extorting from us a tribute of admiration by its public name, has mingled its ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intercourſe with our private lives, has confirmed and instructed us by its example and its precepts, and diſplayed to us, upon a nearer view, a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional degree of that excellence which ſame had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded as its due. To a mind of this make, the ſtamp of death would enliven the impreſſions it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and, creating a melancholy and awful ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for the departed object of its regard, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get its failings, amid its pious fondneſs for the pleaſing remembrance of its worth. The name of Johnſon ſhall live while Piety, while Virtue, while Learning are regarded: yet Johnſon, after the luſtre he had reflected on the name of Thrale, after the delight which his counſel and his friendſhip had, for many years, afforded to the family, aged and infirm, was to be deſerted by his only ſurviving companion and his nurſe a year or two before his end; and after death, to have his memory tortured and abuſed by her deteſted itch for ſcribbling. More injury, we will venture to affirm, has been done to the ſame of Johnſon, by this lady and her late biographical helpmate,<note n="*" place="bottom">Boſwell.</note> than his moſt avowed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0102600102:140"/>
enemies have ever been able to effect; and if his character becomes unpopular with ſome of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, it is to theſe goſſiping friends he is indebted for the favour.</p>
                  <p>In 1789, Mrs Piozzi publiſhed, "Obſervations and Reflections made in the Courſe of a Journey through France, Italy, and Germany," in two oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavo volumes; and, in 1794, "Britiſh Synonymy; or, an Attempt at regulating the Choice of Words in familiar Converſation," in two octavo volumes. The former of theſe works is entertaining, though, in many reſpect, very reprehenſible. To the due execution of the latter, a rare combination of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents was requiſite, among the leaſt of which may be numbered neatneſs of ſtyle, acuteneſs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and a more than common accuracy of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination. This lady, on the contrary, brought to the taſk a jargon, long ſince become proverbial for its vulgarity, an incapability of defining a ſingle term in the language, and juſt ſo much Latin, from a child's ſyntax, as ſufficed to expoſe the ignorance ſhe ſo anxiouſly labours to conceal.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Preface to Baviad.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The general character, which we are diſpoſed to afford Mrs. Piozzi, as an author, is, that ſhe is poſſeſſed of reſpectable talents, and of an educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuperior to what commonly falls to the lot of the fair ſex; but that her vanity is ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous upon every occaſion, as to deſtroy, in moſt

                  <head>POLWHELE, REV. RICHARD.</head>
                  <p>Of Polwhele in Cornwall. A reſpectable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, a very pleaſing poet, but a leſs ſucceſsful hiſtorian. He was born in 1760, at his above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned patrimonial eſtate, was educated at the neighbouring grammar-ſchool of Truro, became a member of Chriſt-Church College, Oxford, was admitted a ſtudent in civil law, afterward took or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and was, for ten years, curate of Kenton near Exeter. Before Mr. Polwhele left Truro-ſchool, he wrote and publiſhed the Fate of Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellyn, a legendary tale; the Genius of Karnbre, a poem; the Spirit of Fraſer to General Burgoyne, an ode; the Death of Hilda, an American tale; an Ode to Mrs. Macaulay, on her Birth-day; the Caſtle of Tintadgel, an ode; and the Iſle of Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, an ode: the two laſt of which were publiſhed among Rack's Eſſays. It is curious that the verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his firſt production, "The Fate of Lewellyn," is much more melodious than that of his "Engliſh Orator," which is nearly the laſt; but the Tale was written to pleaſe the ear only. In 1785, Mr. Polwhele publiſhed, anonymouſly, Book I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of "The Art of Eloquence," a didactic poem; and alſo, "Pictures from Nature, in twelve Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets," each quarto pamphlets. The firſt of theſe was reprinted in the following year, under the title
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0102600102:146"/>
of "The Engliſh Orator," and three more books were afterward added. In the year 1786, Mr. Polwhele alſo publiſhed a Tranſlation into Engliſh verſe, with diſſertations and notes, of the Idyllia, Epigrams, and Fragments of Theocritus, Bion, and Moſchus, with the Elegies of Tyrtaeus, in a quarto volume, which was afterward reprinted in two oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavos. It is ſaid of this work that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted in half a year: if ſo, it does great credit to the talents of the writer, ſince many of the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are extremely happy, and, conſidered as a whole, it is, perhaps, a formidable rival of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar production by Mr. Fawkes. In 1789, Mr. Polwhele publiſhed, two octavo volumes of well-written Diſcourſes on different Subjects; and has, ſince that time, produced a quarto volume of "Poems," containing his "Engliſh Orator," his "Sonnets," and ſome other pieces; a ſingle Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, preached in 1792, at Kenton; Vol. I. of Hiſtorical Views of Devonſhire, in octavo; and Vol. II. of the Hiſtory of Devonſhire, in folio. The <hi>former</hi> of the two laſt-mentioned works is to be completed in five volumes: it is a repoſitory of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious notices, not interfering with the author's main undertaking: the <hi>latter</hi> of them, which is to be comprehended in three volumes, and the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of which was commenced with the ſecond volume, in 1793. Beſide theſe productions, Mr. Polwhele wrote the Biographical Memoirs of Mr. Rack, in Collinſon's Hiſtory of Somerſet, and was
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0102600102:147"/>
the editor of two octavo volumes of "Poems," by gentlemen of Devon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Cornwall, who form a literary ſociety, whoſe meetings are held at ſtated times at the Globe Inn, Exeter, and of which Mr. Polwhele is one of the oldeſt members.</p>

He pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, in 1792, a duodecimo volume, entitled, "Obſervations on the miraculous Conception," &amp;c. with Remarks on Mr. Wakefield's opinion concerning Mat. xxvii. 5; and alſo an octavo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, entitled, "Divine Worſhip founded in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſupported by Scripture Authority," with Remarks on Mr. Wakefield's arguments againſt Public Worſhip, and ſtrictures on ſome parts of his Silva Critica, and Engliſh Verſion of the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament.

Mr. Porſon's firſt regular and avowed publication, was his celebrated volume of Letters to Mr. Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con Travis, in Anſwer to his Defence of the three Heavenly Witneſſes, i. John v. 7, which made its appearance in 1790. Of this work, the celebrated Mr. Gibbon has ſaid, that it is the moſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0102600102:149"/>
acute and accurate piece of criticiſm which has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſince the days of Bentley. The author's ſtrictures are founded in argument, enriched with learning, and enlivened with wit; and his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary neither deſerves, nor finds, any quarter at his hands. The elegant edition of the ſeven Plays of Aeſchylus, without notes, without the ſcholia, and without the fragments, which was publiſhed by Foulis at Glaſgow, in 1795, in a folio volume, was clandeſtinely printed from a text corrected by Mr. Porſon. That gentleman had lent his manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript corrections and conjectures on the text of Aeſchylus, to a friend in Scotland, they fell into the hands of Foulis, and the above-mentioned edition was publiſhed without the Profeſſor's leave, or even knowledge. Mr. Porſon edited the Edition of Heyne's Virgil, which was printed in London; is at preſent, publiſhing new editions of Greek Plays, with ſhort commentaries, by ſingle plays, each in an octavo volume, ſome of which have already made their appearance; and will ſhortly (we believe produce a new Edition of Aeſchylus complete, with Notes.

                  <p>It is needleſs for us to add our eulogium to the well known merit of Mr. Porſon, as a philologiſt, a very conſummate ſcholar, and a moſt acute and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate critic. Many occaſional fugitive productions, which have either never reached the preſs, or, if printed, have appeared anonymouſly, are addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional teſtimonies to the juſt eſtimation in which he is held by the literary world.

What is genius (ſays an elegant writer) without a regulated life!

in that year, a ſerious, affectionate, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible "Exhortation," to that effect. This produced a rude ill-natured attack upon his Lordſhip, from the late Mr. Robert Robinſon, of Cheſterton near Cambridge, who publiſhed the Hiſtory and Myſtery of Good-Friday, in order to ridicule the obſervance of it. Having, previouſly, printed ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional ſingle Sermons, Dr. Porteus publiſhed in 1781 "A Brief Confutation of the Errors of the Church of Rome," extracted from Archbiſhop Secker's five Sermons againſt Popery, and deſigned for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diſtribution. Two years after this, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a volume of Sermons on ſeveral ſubjects, to which he added a ſecond volume, in the year 1794. In both of theſe volumes, many of the occaſional ſingle Sermons, which his Lordſhip had formerly printed were republiſhed, and they are well known to rank among the moſt perfect examples of pulpit eloquence in our language. Dr. Porteus has alſo publiſhed, a Letter to the Clergy of the Dioceſe of Cheſter concerning Sunday Schools, and a Charge delivered to the Clergy of the Dioceſe of London, at the primary Viſitation, in 1790. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's poetical talents have been handſomely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented by Hannah More, in her poem, Senſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. His ſtyle in proſe compoſition is always claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and correct, but, perhaps, he is too ſtudious of avoiding the blandiſhments of ornament and fancy. In his epiſcopal character, he is a pattern of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of conduct.</p>

Since that time, Mr. Pott has publiſhed, four Charges to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of St. Albans; two Sermons for the Feſtivals and Faſts of the Church of England; three ſingle Sermons preached upon particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; and a duodecimo volume of "Elementary Diſcourſes," deſigned for the uſe of a young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon after confirmation.

The lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary world is moſt intrinſically indebted to him for excellent poetical verſions of the three Greek Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedians. Mr. Potter publiſhed, in 1774, an oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tavo
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0102600102:154"/>
volume of "Poems," moſt of the pieces in which had before appeared, ſeparately. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains many very pretty compoſitions, particularly a beautiful farewell Hymn to the country, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spenſer. Three years after this, his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of Aeſchylus made its appearance in a quarto volume, and has, ever ſince, been reprinted with the addition of notes, in two volumes, octavo. Of the excellence of this tranſlation, it is hardly poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay too much: many of the parts are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely beautiful as to leave us in doubt whether any poet, we have ever heard of, could have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the taſk with greater ſucceſs. In 1781, Mr. Potter publiſhed, Vol. I. (in quarto) of his Tranſlation of Euripides, to which Vol. II. was added in the year following; and, in 1788, his Tranſlation of Sophocles was publiſhed, in a quarto volume. Theſe laſt-mentioned verſions are, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, upon the whole, inferior to Mr. Potter's firſt production, yet, they are, each of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent performances, and far ſuperior to thoſe of our former tranſlators, Mr. Wodhull and Dr. Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. Beſide theſe laborious works, Mr. Potter pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, in 1783, "An Enquiry into ſome Paſſages in Dr. Johnſon's Lives of the Poets," a quarto pamphlet; and, in 1785, a Tranſlation of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle concerning Babylon, and the Song of Exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Iſaiah, chap. xiii. and xiv.</p>

                  <p>This voluminous gentleman was, ſome time ago, a bookſeller of the City of Bath. His firſt attempt at diſtinction conſiſted in reading paſſages of ſome of the moſt celebrated poets, in public. When he firſt aſſumed the character of an author, his ſignature was <hi>Courtney Melmoth,</hi> under which his firſt production (in the year 1774) was a quarto pamphlet of wretched ſtanzas, entitled, "The Tears of Genius, occaſioned by the Death of Dr. Goldſmith." In the year following, Mr. Courtney Melmoth produced, Vols. I. and II. (in duodecimo) of "Liberal Opinions upon Animals, Man, and Providence," with the Hiſtory of Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus; a miſerable farrago, which dragged its ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs length to ſix volumes. Mr. Courtney, ſoon afterward, publiſhed Obſervations on Young's
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0102600102:157"/>
Nights Thoughts, in an octavo volume; the Pupil of Pleaſure, a novel, in <hi>illuſtration</hi> of the ſyſtem in Lord Cheſterfield's Letters, and in which the hero of the piece is diveſted of every ſentiment of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, delicacy, and humanity!! the Sublime and Beautiful of Scripture, in two duodecimo volumes; an Apology for the Life and Writings of David Hume, Eſq. in a duodecimo volume; Travels for the Heart, in two duodecimo volumes; the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Shakſpeare, a monody, occaſioned by the death of Mr. Garrick, and honoured with a Bath-Eaſton Prize; Shenſtone Green, a novel, in three duodecimo volumes, founded on the paſſage in Shenſtone's works <q>Had I a fortune of eight or ten thouſand pounds a year, I would build my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a neighbourhood;</q> the Tutor of Truth, a novel, in oppoſition to the Pupil of Pleaſure; and Emma Corbet, a novel, in three duodecimo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, publiſhed in 1780.</p>
                  <p>Mr.Courtney Melmoth having, by this time, ſcribbled himſelf out of notice, "Sympathy," a poem was publiſhed, anonymouſly, in 1781; and, in the ſame year, the Fair Circaſſian, a tragedy, taken from Hawkeſworth's <hi>Almoran and Hamet,</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at Drury Lane, and publiſhed BY MR. PRATT, with a dedication to the Prince of Wales. Since this time Mr. Pratt has always prefixed his name to his productions. In the year 1783, he brought out a Comedy at Drury Lane, entitled. "The School for Vanity," which was, perhaps ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0102600102:158"/>
capriciouſly, condemned; and, two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, he publiſhed "Landſcapes in Verſe," a poem; and four crown octavo volumes of "Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanies," in which many of his former fugitive pieces were reprinted. Mr. Pratt's next produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were, "The Triumph of Benevolence," a poem, occaſioned by the deſign of erecting a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to Mr. Howard; "Humanity," a poem; and an Ode on his Majeſty's Recovery; after which his abſence on the Continent afforded his pen a long repoſe. On his return he made, in 1795, an offering of his Muſe to his native country, by an Ode to the Benevolence of England; and another to the pockets of his countrymen, by three octavo volumes of "Gleanings," through Wales, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, aad Weſtphalia. Since that time, Mr. Pratt has written a novel, in five duodecimo volumes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, "Family Secrets, Literary and Domeſtic;" and two three-penny Letters, one to the Britiſh Soldiers, the other to the Tars of old England.</p>
                  <p>A ſhort time before Mr. Pratt's return from the Continent, the following paragraph was inſerted, for ſeveral days, ſucceſſively, in the London newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, <q>A few days ſince, died, at Baſle in Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerland, the ingenious Mr. Pratt.

Beſide theſe, we only recollect a farce, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, "Joſeph Andrews," which was acted at Drury Lane, in 1788, for Mr. Benſley's benefit, but never printed.

While in Scotland, he compiled a Catalogue of Mr. Ruddiman's Books; and, in May, 1772, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered an Oration on the Inſtitution of Maſonry, at a grand gala of eminent brethren, held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in the Strand. This compoſition was afterward printed in the firſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. Preſton's "Illuſtrations of Maſonry," a well-written panegyrical view of that celebrated fraternity, publiſhed the ſame year. Having been appointed to the office of Deputy Grand Secretary, under James Heſeltine, Eſq. he compiled, for the benefit of the charity, the Hiſtory of Remarkable

                  <p>Fellow of many foreign ſocieties, and a diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clergyman, late of Hackney. This celebrated character was born at Field-head near Briſtall, about ſeven miles from Leeds, in the year 1728-9. His father was a merchant and manufacturer: he received the early part of his education from the Rev. Mr. Scott, a diſſenting miniſter in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and completed it under Mr. Aſhworth, near Daventry in Northamptonſhire. Dr. Prieſtley was educated in the ſtricteſt principles of calviniſm; about the age of twenty he became an Arian, in which perſuaſion he continued for fifteen or ſixteen years; and, at length, embraced the doctrines of Socinus, to which he was chiefly led by Dr. Lard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Letters on the Logos. He was, for ſeveral years, Tutor in the Languages and Belles-Lettres, at the late diſſenting academy of Warrington, whence he returned to his native county, and took upon himſelf the paſtoral office at Mill-Hill Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Leeds. In the year 1773, being appointed Chaplain and Librarian to the Marquis of Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down, then Lord Shelburne, he quitted that ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſided with his Lordſhip for nearly ſeven years. A coolneſs taking place between them,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0102600102:166"/>
and Dr. Prieſtley having received an invitation to ſettle with a ſociety of proteſtant diſſenters at Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham, he undertook the paſtorſhip of the new meeting of that town, on the laſt day of the year 1780. Here he long remained undiſturbed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his pulpit Diſcourſes, his political pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and his private converſation were well known to be highly inimical to the Government of his country, and, eſpecially, to her eccleſiaſtical conſtitution. But his declamatory vehemence, and the indecency of his conduct to the neighbouring clergy, cauſed him to be viewed, by the lower claſſes in Birmingham, as a turbulent, ſeditious man: and, in July 1791, a flame, which had, for a long time, been gaining ſtrength under ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, broke out with dreadful fury upon his devoted head. A moſt infamous libel had been circulated, which was, of itſelf, ſufficient to inflame the minds of the populace; and the fabrication of this paper was ignorantly attributed to Dr. Prieſtley. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the Conſtitution of their country, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to inflict the heavieſt vengeance upon the man, who dared thus to inſult them: and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences were dreadful, indeed. For ſome days, Birmingham was a miſerable ſcene of popular fury. Houſes were pillaged, meeting-houſes burned, and no bounds could have been put to the fury of the enraged mob, had it not been for the wiſe, diſpaſſionate conduct of the neighbouring nobility and gentry, who, at length, ſucceeded in reſtoring
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0102600102:167"/>
peace to the diſtracted town. Dr. Prieſtley ſuffered ſeverely. His houſe, his library, with numerous unpubliſhed manuſcripts, his laboratory, and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able philoſophical apparatus were all deſtroyed. Part of the mob, inflamed with liquor, and more ſavage than the reſt, had actually conceived the horrid deſign of taking away his life: but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious intelligence he had received enabled him to elude their vengeance, and they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with burning his effigy. Upon his arrival in London, Dr. Prieſtley publiſhed a Letter, couched in haughty terms, by which he ſeemed to conſider himſelf as perſecuted for righteousneſs' ſake: and, ſoon afterward, he accepted an invitation to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the late Dr. Price, at the New-College, Hackney. His misfortunes had not, however, cured him of his political frenzy, and his conduct being, at length, marked by Government, a polite intimation was given him to quit the country. Upon this, he emigrated to America, and ſettled at Northumberland-Town, He was, not long ago, a candidate for the office of Chaplain to the Houſe of Aſſembly at New York, but had a minority of votes in favour of Dr. Green.</p>
                  <p>Of the numerous literary productions by Dr. Prieſtley, the firſt was a Treatiſe on the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Engliſh Grammar, which was publiſhed in a duodecimo volume, in 1761, and ſeven years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, republiſhed with great additions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, in an octavo volume. This firſt work
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0102600102:168"/>
was followed, in 1765, by his uſeful Charts of Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and of Univerſal Hiſtory, and by an Eſſay on Liberal Education, in an octavo volume. In 1767, Dr. Prieſtley publiſhed an Hiſtory of Electricity, in a quarto volume; and a familiar Introduction to the Study of Electricity, in a quarto pamphlet; and, in the year following, a Pamphlet on the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; a ſmall Catechiſm; and an Eſſay on the firſt Principles of Government, in an octavo volume. In 1769, was publiſhed Vol. I, (in octavo) of the Theological Repoſitory, conſiſting of original eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays, hints, queries, &amp;c. calculated to promote re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious knowledge, a periodical miſcellany con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Dr. Prieſtley, and continued to ſix vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.

ſundry times, in Philoſophical Tranſactions of learned ſocieties.</p>
                  <p>As a Controverſialiſt, no man upon record has been more diſtinguiſhed than Dr. Prieſtley. He has been engaged with Mr. Venn, a methodiſt; with Mr. Berington, a Roman catholic clergyman; with Mr. Whitehead, a quaker; with Dr. Price and Mr. Palmer, diſſenting miniſters, and Mr. Jacob Bryant, on the ſubjects of Materialiſm and Philoſophical Neceſſity; with Biſhop Newcome, on the duration of our Lord's Miniſtry; with Mr. Hammon, a pretended atheiſt; with Biſhop Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Mr. Badcock, Mr. Burn, Mr, Hawkins, the Jews, (particularly Mr. Levi) and the followers of Baron Swedenborg; and, laſtly, with Mr. Brian Higgins (in particular) on Natural Philoſophy, A ſhort, but curious correſpondence between Mr. Gibbon and Dr. Prieſtley, may alſo be ſeen in Lord Sheffield's publication of that gentleman's poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Works; in which, though the Hiſtorian ſeems well to underſtand the <hi>direct tendency</hi> of the Doctor's character and opinions, the temper of the divine appears to much greater advantage than that of his antagoniſt.</p>
                  <p>Of the abilities of Dr. Prieſtley, none can he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to pronounce that they are of firſt-rate excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. His philoſophical enquiries and publications claim the greateſt diſtinction, and have materially contributed to the advancement of ſcience. As an experimental philoſopher, he is, perhaps, the very
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0102600102:173"/>
firſt of his age. He has alſo been a moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous divine; and, had he proved as diligent in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating truth, as in diſſeminating error, in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the goſpel in the minds of men, inſtead of ſhaking their belief in the doctrines of revelation, perhaps, few characters of the preſent century would have ranked higher as learned men, or have been held in greater eſtimation. On the contrary his political and theological writings muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to be fraught with principles the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the well-being of ſociety. It was a ſaying of Dr. Johnſon that they were calculated to unſettle every thing, but to ſettle nothing. The undaunted and unremitting conſtancy with which he has purſued the eſtabliſhment of his ſpeculative doctrines, has done infinitely more than was to be wiſhed, toward giving popularity to his metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and theological ſentiments: and, if their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended effect has fortunately been counteracted, it is, probably, owing to their violence rather than to any other cauſe. The pillars of revelation, (ſays Mr. Gibbon) are ſhaken by thoſe men who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name without the ſubſtance of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who indulge the licence without the temper of philoſophy!</p>

                  <p>Poet Laureat, and one of the Magiſtrates of the Police Office, Queen Square, Weſtminſter. This gentleman is deſcended from an ancient family in Berkſhire, which county his anceſtors, as well as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0102600102:179"/>
himſelf, have frequently repreſented in Parliament. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, took his degree of M. A. in 1766, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for ſome time, in the Berkſhire Militia. On the death of Dr. Warton, in 1790, he ſucceeded that gentleman as Poet Laureat.</p>
                  <p>We believe Mr. Pye's firſt literary production was an Ode on the Birth of the Prince of Wales, printed in the Oxford Collection. He afterward, occaſionally, publiſhed ſingly and anonymouſly, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral original Poems; and alſo excellent Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſix Olympic Odes of Pindar, omitted by Mr. Weſt; and a Tranſlation of the Art of War, a poem, from the French of the King of Pruſſia, written in 1778, at his leiſure hours during the encampment at Coxheath. In 1783, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, with his name, the Progreſs of Refinement, a poem; and, four years afterward, "Poems on various Subjects," in two octavo volumes, in which all of the pieces, above referred-to, were collected, and a few new ones added. A very elegant Engliſh Tranſlation of the Song of Harmodius and Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geiton, in which the turn of expreſſion of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal has been imitated with extraordinary felicity, is to be found, among other excellent pieces, in this collection. Mr. Pye's ſubſequent publications have been, a Tranſlation of the Poetic of Ariſtotle, firſt publiſhed in an octavo volume, in 1788, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward prefixed to a Commentary on that work, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in a quarto volume; Amuſement, a poetical
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0102600102:180"/>
eſſay, publiſhed in 1790; the War Elegies of Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus imitated, and addreſſed to the People of Great Britain, publiſhed in 1795; the Siege of Meaux, a tragedy, acted at Covent Garden Theatre; and Leonore, a tale, tranſlated from the German of Burger. He is alſo ſpeedily about to preſent the public with a Poem on the Origin and Progreſs of Navigation, which, as we have underſtood, is to cloſe with a ſplendid apoſtrophe, commemorating our late glorious naval victories.</p>
                  <p>The poetry of Mr. Pye cannot, perhaps, upon the whole, be ſaid to be of that very ſuperior kind, which has univerſally exacted from his readers the applauſe of firſt-rate excellence. Yet, none can deny that he is always the elegant ſcholar, the man of taſte and fancy, and the writer of poliſhed ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification; while the great intereſts of virtue and public ſpirit-have uniformly been countenanced by his pen. His ARISTOTLE, though a performance of conſiderable merit, has been diſplaced by the work, ſo ſingularly maſterly, of Mr. Twining.

                  <p>A LADY of great diſtinction in the literary world as a Novel-writer.

Since that time, ſhe has written, "A Sicilian Romance," in two duodecimo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; the Romance of the Foreſt, in three duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decimo volumes; the Myſteries of Udolpho, in four duodecimo volumes; and the Italian, in three duodecimo volumes. They have all been very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally read and admired, eſpecially, the Romance of the Foreſt, and the Myſteries of Udolpho. Her powers of pleaſing, in this line of compoſition, are very ſingularly great; and the happy combination of various talents which her pieces diſplay, entitles their author to rank among the firſt novel-writers of her age; while the beautiful verſes interſperſed among her tales, muſt raiſe her highly in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every poetical genius. Beſide theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, Mrs. Radcliffe publiſhed, in 1795, in a quarto volume, "A Journey made in the Summer of 1794, through Holland and the Weſtern Frontier of Germany, with a Return down the Rhine; to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0102600102:183"/>
which are added, Obſervations during a Tour to the Lakes of Weſtmoreland and Cumberland." This volume was afterward reprinted in two octavos. It is a well-written, entertaining, and authentic work, and adds a new laurel to the brows of the fair writer.</p>

She next wrote the Champion of Virtue, a Gothic ſtory, which was publiſhed in 1777; and was republiſhed in the following year, under the title it has ever ſince retained, viz.

It was an octavo volume, publiſhed in 1764, and entitled, "An Enquiry into the Human Mind, on the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Common Senſe." The great object of this volume was, to refute certain principles with regard to the human underſtanding, which had, for a long time, been commonly adopted by philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and, upon which, Biſhop Berkeley and Mr. Hume had, at laſt, erected a ſyſtem of ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm.

                  <p>Of Gray's Inn. A gentleman whoſe literary attainments are of very ſingular diſtinction and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence. He is the younger ſon of the ſubject of the preceeding article, was educated at Corpus Chriſti College, Oxford, became a Fellow of that ſociety, and was originally deſtined to the church, which he afterward relinquiſhed in favour of the law. While at the Univerſity, he obtained, about the year 1788, a prize for an Eſſay on Refinement, which is one of the moſt maſterly and elegant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances we almoſt ever recollect to have ſeen. A few copies only of it were printed for the ſake of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate diſtribution. Mr. Roberts was alſo, about that time, a frequent contributor to the Engliſh Review, which was then certainly the beſt-conducted literary journal of the day; and, we believe, he alſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, at the Univerſity, an Account of the Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Marbles, in a duodecimo volume. On leaving College, he travelled, for a ſhort time, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; and, ſoon after his return, commenced the publication of his excellent periodical paper, "The Looker-on." No. I. made its appearance, (in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio) March 10th, 1792, the firſt twenty-five num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were publiſhed on Tueſdays and Saturdays,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0102600102:206"/>
then, after an interval of a few months, it was continued on Saturdays only, and the laſt number was dated, December 21ſt 1793. Of the few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributors to this work, Mr. Beresford (vide that name) was the chief. The ſecond edition was printed in three duodecimo volumes; and the third, in four, with ſome additions.</p>
                  <p>Very few, indeed, are, in our opinion, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which the Engliſh language affords, of ſuch finiſhed ſpecimens of eſſay-writing, as are to be found in the Looker-on. The taſte, knowledge, and ingenuity, the ſterling wit, the happy raillery, and the elegance of ſtyle, with which theſe papers are conceived and written, muſt ever characteriſe them as very firſt-rate performances of their kind; while we know of no inſtance, in particular, in which a writer has diſplayed greater power over the feelings of his readers, than in the beautiful and natural ſtory of EUGENIO. The reigning whims and follies of the age have never, in our opinion, ſince the days of Addiſon been combated by the weapons of wit and reaſon with equal addreſs: and, if the 'ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banity of criticiſm, the elegance of morality, and the playfulneſs of alluſion,' which ſo remarkably diſtinguiſh the SPECTATOR, be any where to be looked for ſince thoſe days, it muſt be in the lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations of Simon Olivebranch. The RAMBLER is aſſuredly the only periodical paper, which can, by any means, aſpire to the rank of theſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions; and, let none incautiouſly detract from
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0102600102:207"/>
the ſolid merit of that performance. It has been truly called a body of ethics: and, to give it the higheſt poſſible praiſe, it is a work whoſe profundity and whoſe compoſition are worthy of the great logician and lexicographer whom it owns for its author. Yet, the charms with which Addiſon inſtructs, have gained him, with moſt readers, a preference to his great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; and the Looker-on, with a perfect origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of his own, and with the becoming character of a writer of his own time, is ſurely the SPEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATOR, rather than the RAMBLER of his day.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſingular and a melancholy conſideration that this work, although favourably received, has not experienced from the public that extraordinary diſtinction to which its extraordinary merit certainly entitled it; for let it be read for our amuſement, for the improvement of our taſte, or for the greater ſakes of our religion and our morals, it ſhall be found to anſwer all our purpoſes with ſuperior excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Some blame has, perhaps, been juſtly beſtowed upon the author, for an occaſional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in the amplification of his ſubjects, and for an over-wrought nicety of ſtyle, too like what may be called a falſe refinement in writing: yet, theſe are but as duſt in the balance. It is not to theſe cauſes, we fear, that we are to look for the evil; but to the taſteleſsneſs and inſipidity of the larger portion of that ſhallow age in which the work was written. Melancholy, indeed, is the reflection that the good taſte, which we once, undoubtedly,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0102600102:208"/>
poſſeſſed, ſhould, ſo far, have forſaken us, as to neglect ſuch diſtinguiſhed merit!</p>
                  <p>We ſhall conclude this article by applying to Mr. Roberts the language uſed by one of Mr. Burke's political adverſaries, when ſpeaking of that tranſcendent writer; alledging as our reaſon for ſo doing, that, we know of no LIVING AUTHOR to whom we think them more properly applicable. <q>He is a writer of the moſt ſplendid and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled powers; the faſcination and magic of whoſe eloquence cannot be withſtood. His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial fancy has laid all nature under tribute, and has collected riches from every ſcene of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and every walk of art. His images are ſo ſelect, ſo rich with colours dipt in Heaven, that whoever can read his works without rapture may have merit as a reaſoner, but muſt reſign all pretenſions to taſte and ſenſibility.</q>

                  <head>ROBINSON, MRS. MARY.</head>
                  <p>The maiden name of this celebrated lady, who is deſcended from a very reſpectable family, was Darby. Her father loſt his fortune in promoting a ſcheme for the commercial advantage of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and, afterward, accepted the command of a ſeventy-four-gun ſhip, in the ſervice of the late Empreſs of Ruſſia. Her mother is grand daughter to Catharine Seys, of Boverton Caſtle in Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſhire; whoſe ſiſter, Ann Seys, a woman cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for her virtues and accompliſhments, married Lord King, then Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. Mrs. Robinſon was born in the College Green, Briſtol, received the early part of her educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that city, and, at the age of fifteen, married her preſent huſband, who was then a ſtudent in Lincoln's Inn. Shortly afterward, ſhe thought it proper to exerciſe her talents on the ſtage, and came out in Juliet, under the particular patronage of the Dutcheſs of Devonſhire, on the 10th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, 1776. For three ſeaſons ſhe continued to perform the parts of Lady Macbeth, Imogen, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalind, Cordelia, Ophelia, Viola, Palmira, the Iriſh Widow, Perdita, &amp;c. with great applauſe; and, having in the latter character, attracted by her ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and beauty, the notice of a certain diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed FLORIZEL, ſhe quitted the ſtage at a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0102600102:215"/>
time when ſhe was riſing rapidly in the eſtimation of the public.</p>
                  <p>Of the literary productions of Mrs. Robinſon, we believe, the firſt was a ſmall octavo volume of "Poems," publiſhed in 1775. Two years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhe wrote "Captivity," a poem, and Celadon and Lydia, a tale, which were printed together, in a quarto pamphlet, dedicated to her patroneſs, the Dutcheſs of Devonſhire. In 1778, ſhe brought out a farce, entitled, "The Lucky Eſcape," for her own benefit, at Drury Lane. None of theſe productions appear to have attracted that notice, by which the later writings of their fair author have been ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably diſtinguiſhed; and her pen appears to have been unemployed till about the year 1787, when ſhe figured in the newſpaper, THE WORLD, under the ſignature, Anna Matilda. For an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the correſpondence with Delia Cruſca, kept up from poetical ſympathy, at intervals, for two years, we refer the reader to our memoir of Mr. Merry; and ſhall only obſerve, that we think her poems in the collection, entitled, "The Britiſh Album," certainly claim the ſecond place in point of merit. Mrs. Robinſon alſo produced many pieces about this time in THE ORACLE, under the ſignatures Laura Maria, Julia, Laura, Oberon, &amp;c. In 1790, ſhe publiſhed a poem, inſcribed to Mr. Merry, under the title, <hi>Ainſi va le Monde</hi>; and, in the year following, produced her elegant octavo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of "Poems," which was honoured by a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0102600102:216"/>
very ſplendid liſt of ſubſcribers. The poetical productions with which Mrs. Robinſon has fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the world, ſince that publication, are, a Monody to the Memory of Sir Joſhua Reynolds; Sight, the Cavern of Woe, and Solitude, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed together, in a quarto pamphlet; Modern Manners, a poem, by Horace Juvenal; a Monody to the Memory of the late Queen of France; and Vol. II. of "Poems," in which ſome of theſe pieces are reprinted. In the year 1792, Mrs. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon publiſhed her firſt novel, "Vancenza;" and has, ſince that time, written, "The Widow," "An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelina," and "Hubert de Sevrac," novels; and "The Sicilian Lover," a tragedy. Several popular Pamphlets have alſo been attributed to her pen.</p>
                  <p>The beauty of Mrs. Robinſon's poetry has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her the dignified appellation of THE ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISH SAPPHO. She is ſometimes feeble, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times degenerates into a falſe taſte; but the poetic imagery, the feeling and tenderneſs, the warmth and elegance, and, above all, the delicacy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which breathe through her poems can ſeldom fail to lay her reader under a bountiful contribution of applauſe. As a novel-writer, we think this lady much leſs ſucceſsful. Her VAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENZA ſpeedily reached a third edition, becauſe it was the work of Mrs. Robinſon; but ſurely in falls greatly ſhort of many of her countrywomen, this, as well as in her ſubſequent attempts, ſhe in the talent of pleaſing. Her tragedy (The Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0102600102:217"/>
Lover) is a very favourable ſpecimen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, of her talent in that line of compoſition!</p>

                  <p>Of Liverpool. A gentleman who has acquired great and merited renown in the literary world, by the maſterly manner in which he has, of late, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the public, the Life and Labours of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo de' Medici, called the Magnificent. Mr. Roſcoe was brought up to the profeſſion of an attorney, but does not, we believe, at preſent, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in that line. The above-mentioned work does the higheſt credit to his literary talents, and entitles him to rank with the very firſt writers on European Hiſtory. The circumſtances attending this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are not among the leaſt ſingular in the annals of literature. The full, diſtinct, and accurate idea afforded us, with ſuch genius and learning, of the intereſting ſubject treated in theſe volumes, is the reſult of diſcoveries made in the literature of one of the moſt polite and learned nations of Europe, by a foreigner who had never viſited that country! By a gentleman who was not courting literature in academical bowers, but devoting his time to an active and a laborious profeſſion! Mr. Clarke a banker of Liverpool, and ſon of the late banker of the ſame name, a gentleman of very extenſive
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0102600102:222"/>
information, and the intimate friend of Mr. Roſcoe, had paid a viſit to Italy, and had fixed his winter reſidence at Florence. It was through the aſſiduity of this gentleman, that Mr. Roſcoe obtained his large ſtock of original and intereſting information; as well as the beautiful Poems of Lorenzo de' Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici (with copies of which, as well as with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and exact Tranſlations of them, he has enriched his work) the originals of which are depoſited in the Laurentian Library, although the former editiors appear not to have had the ſlighteſt information re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting them! The work made its firſt appearance in 1795, in two volumes, quarto, under the title, "The Life of Lorenzo de' Medici, called the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent." Such, we have underſtood, was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's diffidence of its ſucceſs, that the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion conſiſted of only two hundred and fifty co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies! So ſmall a number diſappeared very ſoon after publication; and, although the work was printed in the expenſive ſtyle and ſold at a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional price, it has ſeen three editions, even in times ſo unpropitious as the preſent. Nor (as every reader can foretel) has it obtained early po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, without the proſpect of a laſting reputation. It holds the place which it fills in the Hiſtory of Europe by too lawful a tenure ever to renounce its privileges.</p>
                  <p>The celebrated and excellent Letter to Mr. Pitt, BY JASPER WILSON, has been improperly attributed to Mr. Roſcoe. It is the production of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0102600102:223"/>
his friend Dr. James Currie of Liverpool; and, we believe, that the largeſt ſhare he had in that publication was a peruſal of the original copy, and ſome little aſſiſtance he may have given in reviſing the ſheets, as they came from the preſs. Mr. Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe has been engaged, for ſome time, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, upon a Life of Burns the Scotch poet.</p>

It has, however, been imputed to Major Scott, that, notwithſtanding the temerity of his zeal, he was conſiderably inſtrumental in bringing his Principal into the miſerable ſituation, which he was ſo long conſtrained to endure.</p>
                  <p>The pamphlets which he has written ſince thoſe already mentioned, have been Obſervations on Mr. Sheridan's Comparative Statement of the two India Bills; ſeven Letters on the Regency; three Letters to Mr. Fox; Letters to Dodſley in Refutation of certain Miſrepreſentations in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Regiſter; a Letter to Mr. Francis; two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to G. Hardinge, Eſq.; a Letter to Mr. Burke; and Obſervations on Belſham's Memoirs of the Reign of George III. The lateſt of Major Scott's productions, as well as the firſt, is in the cauſe of his friend Mr. Haſtings; and he very properly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that if Mr. Belſham aſpires to the character of an impartial hiſtorian, he ſhould ſtudiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe every paſſage of his work that is calculated

She is the daughter of the late Rev. Thomas Seward, Rector of Eyam in Derbyſhire, Prebendary of Saliſbury, and Canon Reſidentiary of Litchfield. From this parent ſhe received the advantage of a good education, diſcovered early ſymptoms of the rhyming propenſity, and, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the late Lady Miller of Bath-Eaſton, was a frequent and, ſometimes, a ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful candidate for the myrtle wreath of the poetic inſtitution of that villa. Her firſt regular publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a beautiful Elegy on Captain Cook, which,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0102600102:246"/>
together with an Ode to the Sun (a Bath-Eaſton Prize Poem) was publiſhed in a quarto pamphlet, in 1780. In the year following, ſhe produced a Monody on her gallant and amiable friend Major Andrè; and, it is ſaid, that Dr. Darwin, ſpeaking of this poem and the one on Captain Cook, uſed to tell her ſhe was the inventreſs of Epic Elegy. Miſs Seward's ſubſequent productions have been, a Poem to the Memory of Lady Miller; Louiſa, a poetical novel; an Ode on General Elliot's Return from Gibraltar; and "Llangollen Vale, with other Poems," publiſhed in a quarto pamphlet, in 1796.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe productions, perhaps, the firſt, in point of popularity, is the poetical novel; while the one held in higheſt eſtimation for poetical value, by the fair author herſelf, is, we are told, the Ode on General Elliot's Return. Miſs Seward's perpetual ſtudy of uncommon and poetical expreſſion has not unfrequently led her into affectation and obſcurity; yet, the general harmony of her numbers, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſentiment, her elegant deſcription, and her copious imagery, will always inſure her many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers.

                  <p>This celebrated character is of a family which during the greater part of the preſent century has been eminent for genius and learning. His grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father was the intimate friend and favourite of Doctor Swift, the companion of his leiſure, the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his confidence, and the imitator of his wit. His father was the corrector of the Engliſh accent, and was acknowledged to be the beſt declaimer in the Engliſh Language of his day: he was, for a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0102600102:252"/>
conſiderable time, manager of the Dublin Theatre, and being compelled, by the animoſity of party, to quit that ſituation, acquired ſame and profit in London as an actor, and as a lecturer. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mr. Sheridan could alſo boaſt a diſtinguiſhed literary reputation, obtained by ſeveral Plays, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and other Pieces of conſiderable merit.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sheridan was born at Quilea, near Dublin, in the year 1752. At the age of ſix years, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then compelled to quit his native country, brought him to England, and placed him at Harrow School, under the care of Dr. Sumner, who was, at that time, the head-maſter. Here Mr. Sheridan contracted a friendſhip with Dr. Parr, then one of the under-maſters, which has, ever ſince ſubſiſted, between them. It does not appear that he was ever a member of either of the Univerſities; but, the law being his deſtination, was entered of the Middle Temple. At the age of eighteen years, he tranſlated from the Greek, in aſſociation with a friend, the Epiſtles of Ariſtaenetus, and alſo, about that time, printed ſeveral pieces, which are known only to his intimate friends, and among which, we believe, was an Anſwer to the celebrated Heroic Epiſtle to Sir William Chambers. Reſiding for ſome time at Bath, he became acquainted with Miſs Elizabeth Linley, daughter of the late Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Drury Lane, of that name. This lady, celebrated no leſs, in her day, for her mental than for her perſonal accompliſhments, was highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0102600102:253"/>
at that time, as a public ſinger: and a part of her ſtory, very honourable to herſelf, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to a propoſal of marriage, is commemorated by Foote, under the character of Miſs Linnet, in his comedy, entitled, "The Maid of Bath." Not long after this affair, Mr. Sheridan made honourable propoſals to her, and was engaged, on her account in a duel, with a Captain Matthews, which was very ſingular for the courage, ferocity, and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reſentment diſplayed by the parties. In 1773, his ſuit was crowned with ſucceſs; and, though his lady brought him little or no fortune, it has been ſuppoſed that his ſubſequent figure in the world, has been, in ſome degree owing to this marriage. He was now in his twenty-ſecond or twenty-third year, and even at this early period, diſcovered that pride and dignity of mind, which, though not always deſirable companions in the commerce of life, are moſtly characteriſtic of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſpirit, and a true genius. For, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his narrow circumſtances, and the diſtance at which he was then removed from thoſe brilliant proſpects, which he afterward had in view, he would not allow Mrs. Sheridan to engage herſelf at any place of public entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Depending on his own talents alone for ſupport, Mr. Sheridan firſt turned his thoughts to dramatic compoſition; and, in January, 1775, brought out at Covent Garden Theatre his comedy, THE RIVALS. This piece, as it was originally played,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0102600102:254"/>
nearly doubled in length the generality of theatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal performances. It ſuffered greatly on the firſt night from the ſeverity of the audience, and with difficulty obtained a ſecond hearing. Several cauſes conſpired to produce this effect, among which, in juſtice to Mr. Sheridan, muſt be mentioned the miſerable manner in which ſome of the performers (Mr. Lee in particular) acted their parts. Being, however, new moulded by the author, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with conſiderable applauſe, and has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a favourite with the public. This play abounds in character and ſituation: yet, though it bears indiſputable marks of the fertility of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's genius, it is, certainly, far from a perfect compoſition. The character of Mrs. Malaprop, who is diſtinguiſhed from the ordinary run of illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate pretenders, by the mere circumſtance of her pronouncing hard words correctly, but uſing them in an improper ſenſe, inſtead of murdering, the words themſelves, as is uſually the caſe, is ſurely ill-conceived and unnatural. The idea of Acres, with his new-fangled oaths, always ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by objects appropriate to the ſubject of which he is treating, ſeems an equal violation of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and there appears to run through the piece an endeavour to give character and originality, which is always built upon affected circumſtances, and not upon experience and knowledge of human nature. When Mr. Sheridan publiſhed this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he acknowldged his youth and inexperience,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0102600102:255"/>
and adopted the error of dreading imitation, aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his preface that, <q>on ſubjects on which the mind has been much informed, invention is ſlow of exerting itſelf.</q> Yet, it has always happened in ſome degree to thoſe writers, who think that the want of information will aſſiſt their invention, that they have incurred the very cenſure they were anxious to avoid, and have exhibited as new what is ſtale and hackneyed, and what a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate acquaintance with their ſubject would have taught them to reject. In this year he alſo produced, St. Patrick's Day, a farce, which was originally repreſented for the benefit of Mr. Clinch, who ſeems to have been favoured with it, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or his repreſentation of the Iriſhman in the Rivals, in which he greatly excelled Mr. Lee.</p>
                  <p>In the following year, Mr. Sheridan enriched the Engliſh drama, with his celebrated comic opera, THE DUENNA. The ſucceſs of this piece was beyond all former example. The Beggar's Opera which had all the wits and half the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of England for its ſupports, ran ſixty-three nights in one ſeaſon; the Duenna, ſeventy-five. The ſatire of this piece is beautiful and poignant; the flaſhes of wit are perpetual and always genuine; while the ſongs are characteriſed by that <hi>onction.</hi> that ripeneſs and mellowneſs of expreſſion, which is, probably, the grand ſecret of ſong-writing. This piece did not reach the preſs, by the author's conſent till the year 1794.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0102600102:256"/>But, even the merit of the Duenna was thrown into comparative oblivion on the appearance, in the following year, of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL. No dramatic production ever equalled this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated piece in ſucceſs. It can receive no honour from additional praiſe, nor is it likely to be injured by the ſevereſt critical examination. Character it is true, is not the fort even of this greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of our author; yet, the plot is ſo natural, the mirror held up ſo true, the incidents follow with ſuch eaſe and grace, the dialogue is ſo chaſte and lively, the wit ſo brilliant and ſtirling, and every thing is ſo exquiſitely finiſhed and ſo happily conveyed, that our entertainment is unbounded, and we can never enough applaud our mirth. This piece (the policy, as we ſuppoſe, of our earlieſt theatres being on this occaſion revived) has never lawfully reached the preſs, though, ſome editions of it have been printed in Ireland, from a ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled copy, and ſold here.</p>
                  <p>In 1778, Mr. Sheridan brought out at Drury Lane "The Camp," a dramatic entertainment, intended to compliment the Dutcheſs of Devonſhire, which has never been printed; and, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year, "The Critic, or a Tragedy Rehearſed," a farce, which <hi>has</hi> reached the preſs. The Critic is diſtinguiſhed by that genuine wit, which has ſo often characteriſed the productions of its author, and is a piece which has obtained the frequently repeated applauſes of the public. Its firſt act has
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0102600102:257"/>
particular merit, in the character of Sir Fretful Plagiary, which, as is well known, is a ſatire upon Mr. Richard Cumberland, a gentleman of mild and amiable manners, but, who is probably, in ſome degree, ſubject to the weakneſs here ridiculed, and who had been ſo ill-adviſed, or ſo unfortunate as to give offence to Mr. Sheridan. The two laſt acts, which conſiſt of a mock tragedy, have as much merit as their ſubject will allow, under the two-fold diſadvantage of being barren in itſelf, and of having been anticipated by the popular comedy of the Rehearſal. The author of the Rehearſal had the advantage of writing in an aera of falſe taſte, and of having for the topic of his ridicule, the abſurdities of ſo great a genius as Mr. Dryden. The errors of more modern tragedies were too evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcent for ſatire, and Mr. Sheridan, in order to be intelligible, was obliged, ſometimes to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the beſt paſſages of Shakſpeare: now it is true that our mirth may be excited by a traveſty of Homer or Virgil, but we never can applaud the author. To the pen of Mr. Sheridan are alſo to be attributed, "A Trip to Scarborough," a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, as <hi>altered</hi> from Vanburgh's <hi>Relapſe</hi>; a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nody to the Memory of Mr. Garrick, which would have reflected luſtre upon an inferior genius, but added nothing to our admiration of Mr. Sheridan; the Prologue to Captain Ayſcough's tragedy, Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis, which is a beautiful piece of poetry; and ſeveral more highly elegant trifles, which are to be
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0102600102:258"/>
found in different collections of fugitive pieces. The public has alſo, for many years, been flattered with the hopes of receiving from the ſame ſource, "The Foreſters," a comic opera; and Affectation, a comedy; but, from the length of their delay, we may be led to deſpair of their appearance.</p>
                  <p>It was in the year 1776, when Mr, Garrick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the ſtage, that Mr. Sheridan purchaſed, in aſſociation with Mr. Linley his father-in-law, and with Dr. Ford, one moiety of the property of Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lane Theatre; to which they ſoon afterward added the other moiety. Mr. Sheridan's ſhare of this property is ſaid to have been more than a half; and, for ſome years, he continued the acting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager of the theatre. His careleſsneſs and inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the intereſts of this ſituation were very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and the credit of old Drury certainly loſt: a ſturdy prop in her celebrated Garrick. But, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing completed every thing with regard to the ſtage, to which his ambition could aſpire, Mr. Sheridan turned the activity of his mind to another object, and was encouraged, by the friendſhip of Mr. Fox, to offer himſelf a candidate for repreſenting the town of Stafford in the Parliament, which was ſummoned to meet October 30th, 1780. The new life into which his ſucceſs introduced him, exalted his views, and, by engaging his talents in the concerns of his country, has had a fatal effect on his dramatic purſuits. Yet, it muſt be acknowledged a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able circumſtance that a writer ſhould ſo ſoon have
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0102600102:259"/>
reached the higheſt pinnacle of excellence, in a path ſo arduous of aſcent, and that he ſhould then have relinquiſhed it for ever.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sheridan did not inherit from nature every advantage toward making him a great public ſpeaker. His voice, in particular, was neither ſtrong, harmonious, nor of conſiderable compaſs. He had, however, the benefit of a remarkably clear and accurate articulation, and was early initiated in ideas of public ſpeaking by his father. The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under which he laboured were conquered by unwearied perſeverance, and by the exerciſe of his voice on trifling topics and ordinary occaſions. This conqueſt was not completed when he was appointed, in 1782, Under Secretary of State, in the department of Mr. Fox, or when, in the year following, he was promoted to the place of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the Treaſury under the Duke of Portland. In the ſeſſion of 1785, he made a celebrated Speech upon the fourth of the twenty Iriſh Propoſitions; and, in the following year, upon a motion, brought forward by himſelf, upon the ſubject of finance: of the former of theſe Speeches a tolerable report was publiſhed, and has been inſerted in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Regiſter. But Mr. Sheridan roſe to his greateſt height, as a ſpeaker, in 1787, when he opened the third article of impeachment, in the Houſe of Commons, againſt Mr. Haſtings, upon the ſubject of the puniſhment inflicted by him for the rebellion of the Princeſſes of Oude. This
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0102600102:260"/>
ſpeech was five hours and a half in length, and thoſe who heard it ſeemed to think that no lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage could do juſtice to its wit, its ſublimity, and its pathos. It is hardly neceſſary to add that Mr. Sheridan has, for many years, been one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed leaders of the oppoſition. As an elegant ſcholar, we may ſafely ſay he has not a ſuperior in the ſenate of his country; and, however different the ſenſations may be, with which his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter will impreſs ſome of thoſe who contemplate him as a genius and as a man, the urbanity of his behaviour in that aſſembly, and the uniformly claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical elegance and grace of his diction, muſt command the admiration of all.</p>
                  <p>Not many years after the loſs of his firſt wife, Mr. Sheridan married, in 1794, Miſs Ogle, daughter of the Dean of Wincheſter. About this time he attempted to diſpoſe of his property in the theatre, but, though he ſold a part of it, he ſtill retains the larger ſhare.</p>

This Baronet was born in the year 1754, and is the only ſurviving ſon of the late George Sinclair, Eſq. of Ulleſter in the county of Caithneſs, North Britain. He was educated at the High-ſchool, Edinburgh, and at the Univerſities of Edinburgh, Glaſgow, and Oxford. In the year 1780, he was choſen Member for Caithneſs, his native county, which he repreſented in two Parliaments, and was choſen, at the laſt election, for Petersfield, Hants. Sir John Sinclair is diſtinguiſhed for his knowledge of Finance, Agriculture, and Statiſtics. He publiſhed, in the year 1782, "Obſervations on the Scottiſh Dialect," deſigned to remove the diſtinction which
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0102600102:266"/>
a different dialect had produced between nations united under the ſame government, and connected by ſimilar cuſtoms and laws; alſo "Lucubrations during a ſhort Receſs," an anonymous pamphlet; and "Thoughts on the Naval Strength of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Empire," a pamphlet. The anonymous pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet produced ſeveral Anſwers, one, in particular, by Lord Camelford, drawn up with great ability: the Pamphlet on our Naval Strength was alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered from the preſs. In the following year, Sir John Sinclair wrote a pamphlet, entitled, "Hints addreſſed to the Public," on the ſtate of our finances, which (in oppoſition to the Earl of Stair, among other writers) was the firſt of the publications aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the ample reſources of the nation. His ſubſequent productions have been, "The Hiſtory of the Public Revenue of the Britiſh Empire," a very elaborate and intereſting work, in two volumes, quarto, of which the firſt was publiſhed in 1785; "State of Alterations which may be propoſed in the Laws for regulating the Election of Members of Parliament for Shires in Scotland," a pamphlet, publiſhed in 1787; an Addreſs to the Edinburgh Society for the Improvement of Britiſh Wool, of which Sir John was appointed chairman; an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Landed Intereſt, on the Corn Bill, (1791); "Statiſtical Account of Scotland," drawn up from the communications of the miniſters of the different pariſhes, in twenty volumes, octavo, of which the two firſt were publiſhed in 1792, a work

This nobleman (formerly Lord Viſcount Mahon) has applied himſelf with ſome ſucceſs to the ſtudies of Mathematics and Natural Philoſophy; and has contributed ſeveral Papers upon theſe ſubjects to the Philoſophical Tranſactions. In the year 1775, his Lordſhip publiſhed "Conſiderations on the Means of Preventing Fraudulent Practices on the Gold Coin," a pamphlet which he had written at Geneva two years previouſly; in 1779, "Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Electricity," in a quarto volume: and, in 1786, "Obſervations on Mr. Pitt's Plan for the Reduction of the National Debt." His Lordſhip's ſubſequent publications have been, a Letter to Mr. Burke, in Anſwer to his Speech on the French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution (1790); and "The Rights of Juries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended," a pamphlet. Previously to the troubles in France, his Lordſhip, although miniſterial in his politics and united by conſanguinity, as well as inclination to the Chancellor of the Exchequer diſplayed conſiderable independence in his conduct, and bore the character of one deſirous to promote the public welfare to the beſt of his judgement. Since thoſe appearances his political conduct has
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0102600102:277"/>
been highly extravagant. In 1794, he made a motion to acknowledge the French Republic; and ſome of his Speeches have even excited the riſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his adherents. Not long ago, in the true levelling ſpirit, his Lordſhip gave the hand of his daughter, Lady Stanhope, in marriage to Mr. Taylor a ſurgeon of Seven-Oaks in Kent.</p>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0102600102:278"/>
as an author has been in the Account he has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed of the Embaſſy to China. This long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected work made its appearance in Auguſt, 1797; in two volumes, quarto, accompanied by a folio volume of plates, under the title, "An Authentic Account of the Embaſſy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China." Such was the public curioſity, that, although it was printed in a very expenſive ſtyle, and the impreſſion conſiſted of a large number of copies, every one was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for long before the day of publication. An octavo edition of it, in three volumes, has been publiſhed ſince its firſt appearance. The AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COUNT was taken chiefly from the papers of Lord Macartney, the Ambaſſador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary; of Sir Eraſmus Gower, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the expedition; and of other gentlemen in the ſeveral departments of the Embaſſy. Though it may be ſaid to contain little additional infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation reſpecting China, to what was already to be found in the writings of Duhalde, Groſier, and others who have travelled in that country, it muſt be confeſſed that Sir George Staunton en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed peculiar advantages for deſcribing with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy the phyſical as well as moral ſtate of the vaſt empire. So remarkable an inſtance of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary abilities and opportunities to collect infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and of ſtrict authenticity in reporting it, as concurred in the caſe of the gentlemen who accompanied this embaſſy, can very rarely

happen! It is true that in theſe volumes utility is never ſacrificed to pleaſure, nor inſtruction to amuſement. Veracity, candour, and modeſty mark them in every page; but the author's exceſs of precaution againſt egotiſm, ſuperinduces a ſtyptic dryneſs too often to be lamented. It is ſaid that a large ſum of money was preſented to Sir George Staunton by the Eaſt India Company, to defray the expence of the drawings and engravings which belong to this work.</p>

                  <p>This celebrated traveller is the youngeſt ſon of the late Sir John Swinburne, Bart. of Capheaton in Northumberland, the long-eſtabliſhed ſeat of that ancient Roman Catholic family. He was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0102600102:291"/>
at Scorton School in Yorkſhire; and, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſtudied at Paris, Bourdeaux, and the Royal Academy at Turin. After this he made the uſual tour of Italy, and, in 1774, travelled with his lady on the Continent, for the expreſs purpoſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging their taſte for antiquities and the fine arts. Mr. Swinburne ſpent ſix years in France, Spain, Italy, and Germany, during which time he formed an intimacy with ſome of the moſt celebrated lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati of thoſe countries, and received ſome ſignal marks of eſteem from the Sovereigns of the courts he viſited. On his return to England he retired to his ſeat at Hamſterly, in the Biſhoprick of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, which has been his place of chief reſidence ſince that time. The firſt of Mr. Swinburne's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications was his quarto volume of Travels through Spain, which appeared in 1779. Four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he publiſhed Vol. I. (in quarto) of his celebrated Travels in the two Sicilies; to which Vol. II. was added two years afterward. Both of theſe works have been reprinted in octavo; the firſt in two, and the laſt in four volumes. The learning and ingenuity of Mr. Swinburne are too well known to require an additional panegyric from us. The warmth and animation of his deſcriptions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an imagination highly ſuſceptible to every beauty of nature, or of art; and, if he have a fault it is, that he is too apt to relinquiſh ſimplicity for profuſion of ornament.</p>

Upon the publication
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0102600102:303"/>
of Paine's "Rights of Man," Mr. Thelwall was one of the firſt to diſplay a zealous attachment to his principles; and he ſoon afterward began to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a courſe of Lectures of an inflammatory ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, at Beaufort Buildings in the Strand. Here, evening after evening, he thundered out philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics againſt the Conſtitution of his country, with the vehemence of an impaſſioned demagogue, to the admiration of the vileſt refuſe of the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. In the year 1794, theſe Diſcourſes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the hand of Government, and the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was conveyed to the Tower to take his trial, together with Hardy, Tooke and ſome other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly citizens. During his confinement, Mr. Thel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall wrote ſome Poems, which were publiſhed after his releaſe. Having been tried at the Seſſions Houſe, Old Bailey, in November, 1794, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted with the other priſoners, his ſubſequent behaviour has been no leſs marked by its miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous tendency, than it was previouſly to his impriſonment. Under the ſemblance of illuſtrating Ancient Hiſtory, he has continued his political Lectures, and has transferred his pernicious ſchool to different parts of the country. At Yarmouth he was, ſome time ago, interrupted in a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner in the midſt of his oratory, by the abrupt entrance of a body of ſailors, who were heated with liquor, and who, actuated by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iprudent zeal, committed ſeveral unjuſtifiable acts

of violence upon the auditory. He alſo experienced ſome riotous oppoſition at Lynn and at Wiſbeach.</p>
                  <p>As an author, Mr. Thelwall made his firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in 1787, when he publiſhed Orlando and Almeyda, a legendary tale in the manner of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, and alſo "Poems on various Subjects," in two duodecimo volumes. The touching ſimplicity which is characteriſtic of true poetry, is, in theſe wretched pieces, ſupplied by a plain proſaic dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is as remote as poſſible from it. After this unfortunate attempt, Mr. Thelwall did not ſeek the preſs again till the year 1794, when No. I. of his Political Lectures made its appearance. In the following year he publiſhed "The Natural and Conſtitutional Right of Britons to Annual Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Univerſal Suffrage, and the Freedom of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Aſſociation," the Speech which he intended to have delivered on his trial.

                  <p>Knight of the orders of the White Eagle and St. Staniſlaus, &amp;c. and Fellow of many foreign So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. This ingenious Philoſopher and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter is a native of the town of Rumford in the Province of Maſſachuſets. During the late war between the Colonies and the mother Country, he raiſed a regiment of American Dragoons, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſed himſelf on many occaſions during the heat of that conteſt. In 1784, by his Majeſty's permiſſion, he engaged himſelf in the ſervice of his Serene Highneſs the Elector Palatine, Reigning Duke of Bavaria, and was employed in various public ſervices, particularly in arranging his military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0102600102:306"/>
and in introducing a new ſyſtem of order, dicipline, and oeconomy among his troops. He alſo formed eſtabliſhments for the relief of the poor at Munich, furniſhed them with employment, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted many plans for providing them with food at ſmall expence, and, by various experiments, enabled them to abridge their conſumption of fuel. In purſuing theſe enquiries, he made ſome valuable diſcoveries in the conſtruction of Chimneys; and was enabled to point out means, which have ſince been ſucceſsfully put in practice in this country alſo, of increaſing the heat, and, at the ſame time, decreaſing the quantity of fuel. Count Rumford, moreover, introduced manufactures into Munich, until then unknown; and was the mean of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarizing the uſe of the Potatoe in Germany. The honours which he has received from his new maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Elector are of the higheſt diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>The publications of Count Rumford have been confined to his Experimental Eſſays, Political, Oeconomical, and Philoſophical, ſeven of which have been publiſhed in octavo pamphlets. They have been very generally read, and breathe, in every page, the benevolent and philoſophic ſpirit of their author.</p>

                  <p>This celebrated character was formerly, while he bore the ſirname of Horne, a member of St. John's College, Cambridge, and afterward a Clergyman of Brentford in Middleſex. He took a very active part in the election canvas of Mr. Wilkes, at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable period of 1768; and was deeply concerned with Meſſrs. Glynn, Sawbridge, Oliver, Townſend, Bellas, Vaughan, &amp;c. in the ſubſequent meaſures, for the ſupport of Mr. Wilkes' cauſe, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Society of the Bill of Rights. An accuſation having been brought againſt Mr. Wilkes, that he ſtrove to engroſs the whole ſubſcription money of this ſociety to himſelf, and that he would not permit the other ſufferers in the cauſe of liberty to ſhare in its benefits, Mr. Horne together with many others, deſerted his political leader, and a newſpaper controverſy, ſoon afterward, broke out between theſe two gentleman, in which they very liberally accuſed each other of roguery and ſwindling, about an <hi>important</hi> affair of a Welch poney, and a packet of foul linen. Mr. Horne alſo entered the liſts with the celebrated JUNIUS, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0102600102:315"/>
in which the political divine is commonly thought to have come off ſecond-beſt. While Miniſter of New Brentford, he publiſhed in the year 1796, a ſingle Sermon on the precarious tenure of human friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and, in the year following, an Oration which he delivered at a numerous Meeting of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of Middleſex, at Mile-end Aſſembly Room, March 30th, 1770, to conſider of an Addreſs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, and Petition to his Majeſty. It is probable that the manner in which he had embroiled himſelf in political diſpute, and the conſpicuous and improper part which he had acted, were his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to the reſignation of his gown. Since that time he has made himſelf a moſt conſpicuous champion of republicaniſm. In the year 1777, he was tried for a libel, in having charged the King's troops with murdering the American ſoldiery at Lexington and Bunker's Hill. He ſubpoenaed Lord George Sackville and, ſeveral of the King's Miniſters, who did not think it proper to anſwer his ſummons; and, having undertaken to plead his own cauſe, he delivered a ſpeech three hours in length, full of ingenuity, argument, and ſhrewdneſs. This ſpeech, printed in the State Trials, is highly creditable to his talents, as a conſtitutional lawyer.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Horne was, at this time, preparing himſelf for the bar; but objections were raiſed to exclude him from the profeſſion he had choſen, and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral attempts which he made to addreſs his old audiences of freeholders and others, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0102600102:316"/>
overborne and ſilenced. The native energy of his mind enabled him to find a conſolation amid theſe diſappointments in the purſuits of literature and having applied himſelf to the ſtudy of Univerſal Grammar, the firſt fruit of his labour appeared in a Letter to Mr. John Dunning (Lord Aſhburton) publiſhed in 1777. This pamphlet, now become very ſcarce, is the ſkeleton of his ſubſequent cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated work on this ſubject, to be noticed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and it is ſaid Dr. Johnſon thought ſo well of it, that he told a friend, if he ever printed a new edition of his dictionary, he ſhould adopt many of Mr. Horne's etymologies of the conjunctions. Five years after this he publiſhed a Letter to Lord Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton on Parliamentary Reform, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by Ridgway in 1794. Mr. Horne aſſumed the ſirname of Tooke in the year 1782, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the will of Andrew Tooke Eſq. a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who bequeathed him an eſtate; and in 1786 he publiſhed celebrated etymological work, entitled, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or Diverſions of Purley, in an octavo volume. Theſe WINGED WORDS obtained the above title from Purley near Croydon, at that time the reſidence of the author, and formerly the ſeat of Preſident Bradſhaw. In this work Mr. Tooke has pointed out, and has himſelf proceeded far in, a path before untrodden, and evidently leading to improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which the ſcience of grammar may be eſtabliſhed on a ſure baſis. It has been highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and is conceived by the generality of its rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0102600102:317"/>
to have totally demoliſhed the ſyſtem of Mr. James Harris of Saliſbury, who had long ſhared in profuſion the compliments of the literari. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of his grammatical reſearches has been promiſed to the world; and we have underſtood that "The Diverſions of Purley," are reprinting in quarto. In the year 1787, Mr. Tooke publiſhed an extraordinary Letter in defence of Mrs. Fitzherbert, under the idea of her being the lawful conſort of the Prince of Wales; and in the year following "Two pair of Portraits," a pamphlet, exhibiting, in the painter's own ſtyle, the late Lords Chatham and Holland, and their ſons Meſſrs Pitt and Fox.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Tooke diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſome years ago as the ſtrenuous partiſan of Lord Hood in the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Election. In 1792 an action of debt, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the ſtatute 28 Geo III. c. 52, was brought againſt him by Mr. Fox for the ſum of £ 198 2<hi>s.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> the taxed amount of Mr. Fox's expences, incurred in defending himſelf againſt the memorable petition preſented by Mr. Tooke to the Houſe of Commons. The verdict of the Jury was, with great deliberation and juſtice, in favour of the plaintiff, and Mr. Tooke himſelf publiſhed an account of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Being a very active Member of the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding Society, he was taken into cuſtody in May 1794, by a warrant from the Secretary of State, on ſuſpicion, of High Treaſon, and was afterward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower. His trial came on at the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions Houſe in the Old Baily, the November follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0102600102:318"/>
together with thoſe of Hardy, Thelwall, &amp;c. and ended in his acquittal. In 1796 he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the ſecond time as a candidate for repreſenting the City of Weſtminſter in company with Meſſrs. Fox, and Admiral Sir Alan Gardner. Not having any proſpect of ſucceſs, he amuſed himſelf upon the huſtings with deriding Sir Alan Gardner before an ignorant unprincipled mob!</p>
                  <p>However unpopular Mr. Tooke may have made himſelf with the better part of mankind by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction he has aimed at as a Philoſopher of the New Sect, he is certainly entitled to the credit of firſt-rate abilities. His ſtyle is clear and nervous, and the acuteneſs of his intellect has ſeldom been equalled. As a Scholar and Philologiſt his fame will probably live while our language exiſts; and even as a Politician it has been ſaid for him, that he is one of the few of his day whoſe conduct has been uniformly conſiſtent with itſelf.</p>

                  <p>A Diſſenting Clergyman, formerly a Bookſeller in Fore Street. Obtaining the patronage of certain diſſenting miniſters, he was encouraged to apply himſelf to the cultivation of letters, and embraced the profeſſion of a divine. In 1774 he was choſen paſtor of a congregation of proteſtant diſſenters at Highgate, and was elected, four years afterward, one of the miniſters of the congregation at Newing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Green: he thus became joint-miniſter of that congregation for ſeveral years with the celebrated Dr. Price, and ſtill continues in the ſame office.

In the year 1779, the Univerſity of Edinburgh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him the degree of L. L. D.</p>
                  <p>Of the literary productions of Dr. Towers, the firſt was a pamphlet, entitled, "A Review of the Genuine Doctrines of Chriſtianity," which was publiſhed in 1763. Since that time, he has publiſhed a Charity Sermon, and many Tracts, a chiefly temporary and political. Of theſe Tracts a Collection was made by the Doctor, in 1796, in three octavo volumes. They are marked by an attachment to the intereſts of virtue and religion; but are written upon whig principles, and are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of a politician who is more addicted to warmth than ſtrict moderation can approve. Dr. Towers has alſo written the firſt ſeven volumes of a work, entitled "Britiſh Biography," in ten vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, octavo; Memoirs of the Life and Reign of Frederick III. King of Pruſſia, in two volumes, octavo; and an Oration delivered at the London Tavern November 4th, 1788, on occaſion of the commemoration of the Revolution, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a century from that great event. He alſo gave conſiderable aſſiſtance to Dr. Kippis in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the new edition of the Biographia Britannica; and is ſuppoſed to be the editor of the laſt edition of the Britiſh Plutarch. Dr. Towers was ſaid, at one time, to have engaged in writing a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Hume's Hiſtory of England, but, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that plan is laid aſide. As a compiler he has great merit.</p>

It was in the year 1791, that Mr. Townſend favoured the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic with an Account of his Journey through Spain, in 1786, and 1787, in three octavo volumes. This work, upon the whole, does great credit to its author; but had he been leſs circumſtantial on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of chemiſtry and natural hiſtory, as well as in deſcribing local peculiarities of the country, he would probably have ſucceeded better in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant point of attracting readers. Since the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of this his chief publication, Mr. Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end has ſet a very praiſe-worthy example to his reverend brethren, by the proofs he has given the world of his attention to medical ſubjects.

Since that time, he has written, "A Trip to Paris in July and Auguſt, 1792," a thin octavo volume, in which he is, as uſual, volatile but, for the greater part, ſenſible.</p>

Mr. Vince alſo engaged, in 1795, in aſſociation with Mr. Wood of St. John's College, in the publication of a work, entitled, "The Principles of Mathematics and Natural Philoſophy," which is intended to compriſe, in four octavo volumes, the ſubſtance of the Lectures on thoſe ſubjects, which are uſually read in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.

                  <p>Of Hackney. A very diſtinguiſhed Claſſical Scholar: formerly a clergyman of the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at preſent, a diſſenting layman. Mr. Wakefield was born at Nottingham, in 1756, his father being then Rector of St. Nicholas, in that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0102600102:349"/>
town. He was educated at the Free-ſchool, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham; under the Rev. Richard Wooddeſon, of Kingſton-upon-Thames; and at Jeſus College, Cambridge: having, in his earlieſt infancy, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that ardent deſire of knowledge, which, from his unceaſing application, appears never to have been impaired. At the "Univerſity Mr. Wakefield cultivated uſeful learning with great ſucceſs; and, on his admiſſion to the degree of B. A. in 1776, received diſtinguiſhed honours for his mathematical, as well as for his claſſical at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments. Soon after this he was elected Fellow of Jeſus College; and, in 1778, was ordained a deacon. Mr. Wakefield was even then ſo little ſatisfied with the requiſition of <hi>ſubſcription,</hi> and with the ſubjects of that ſubſcription themſelves, that, as he properly confeſſes in the MEMOIRS of his own Life, he has ſince regarded this acquieſcence as an action highly diſingenuous. While he held his ſtation in the Church, which has now for many years been relinquiſhed, he was ſucceſſively, for a ſhort time, curate of Stockport in Cheſhire, and of St. Peter's and St. Paul's in Liverpool. In the year 1779, he removed to Warrington in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire, to accept the office of Claſſical Tutor at the diſſenting Academy in that town. Here Mr. Wakefield remained until the diſſolution of that ſeminary, in 1783, when he removed to Bramcote near Nottingham, with a view of receiving pupils; and, after a ſhort reſidence at this place, and at
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0102600102:350"/>
Richmond, lived for ſome years at Nottingham, in the ſame occupation. In 1790, he was choſen Claſſical Tutor of the New College, Hackney; ſince which time, that town has been the place of his reſidence. His connexion with the college ended a year after his acceptance of his office, and his ſubſequent days have been ſpent in a diligent proſecution of his ſtudies.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wakefield commenced author in the year 1776; when he printed, at the Cambrige preſs <hi>Poemata Latine partim Scripta partim Reddita,</hi> with a few critical Obſervations on Horace, in a ſmall quarto volume. Although he has ſince diſcovered one <hi>falſe quantity</hi> in theſe poems, they do him great credit as a very elegant ſcholar at an early age. His next publication was a new Tranſlation of St. Paul's firſt Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſuch notes as were neceſſary to juſtify his variations from the eſtabliſhed verſion. This was publiſhed in 1781, and experienced a favourable reception. His numerous ſubſequent publications followed each other at no very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable intervals of time, in nearly the following order, viz. an Eſſay on Inſpiration, conſidered chiefly with reſpect to the Evangeliſts; a ſhort Treatiſe on Baptiſm; a new Tranſlation of St. Matthew, with Notes, critical, philological, and explanatory, in a quarto volume; Vol. I.

                  <p>It was the intention of Mr. Wakefield, had not the ſources of academical favour ben dried up, to have carried on his <hi>Silva Critica</hi> through the whole compaſs of ancient literature; uniting theological and claſſical learning, and illuſtrating the ſcriptures by light borrowed from the philology of Greece and Rome. His Tranſlation of the New Teſtament is a very valuable performance; his edition of Pope's Illiad and Odyſſey, a very complete and elegant publication; and his edition of Lucretius, upon the large paper, the handſomeſt book we almoſt ever recollect to have ſeen. He has alſo written, beſide the pieces already enumerated, a very maſterly Eſſay on the Origin of Alphabetical Characters, which was read to the Literary and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Society of Mancheſter at two ſucceſſive meetings, was the more immediate occaſion of his being elected an honorary member of that Society, and has been inſerted in the New Annual Regiſter, and in the Scotch Encyclopaedia.

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0102600102:354"/>

                  <p>In contemplating Mr. Wakefield's General Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as an author, the firſt and higheſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is due to his remarkable induſtry. It is this active principle that has enabled him, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable ſhare of talent, to ſerve the trueſt intereſts of uſeful letters, with far greater effect than has commonly fallen to the lot of firſt-rate genius. His knowledge of Greek and Roman authors is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and accurate; and as a critic he poſſeſſes a ſpirit moſt penetrating and ardent. As an emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dator he is frequently ingenious, but, certainly, for the greater part, too bold. His Latin ſtyle as he himſelf acknowledges, ſavours more of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive energy of Quintilian, than of the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent volubility of Cicero. It is not a little ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and particularly to be lamented for the ſake of Mr. Wakefield's credit, that, with ſuch peculiar faculties for the enjoyment of claſſical ſtudies, he ſhould ever have forſaken that flowery path to ſhare the grovelling walks of writers, infinitely his inferiors; relinquiſhing the loftieſt diſtinctions of literary character, for a pitiful diſplay of party-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or peculiarity of opinion. Some of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial writings, theological as well as political,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0102600102:355"/>
are peculiarly indecent for their violence and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality; and his diſpoſition appears, upon theſe occaſions, to ſuch diſadvantage that his unpopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſeems a neceſſary conſequence. His Engliſh ſtyle is always manly and graceful, and, ſometimes, peculiarly elegant and energetic: moſt readers will, however, object to his ſuperabundant uſe of claſſical quotations. His numerous writings have for the greater part experienced an indifferent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and ſome of them, particuliarly the earlier ones, have been ſeverely handled by the critics of their day.</p>

                  <p>Better known by his aſſumed name, PETER PINDAR. This comical genius is deſcended from, a reſpectable family in Devonſhire, was bred to the ſtudy of phyſic, and practiſed for ſome time, with ſucceſs, in the county of Cornwall. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward followed the fortunes of his friend, the late Sir William Trelawney to Jamaica, and became Phyſician General to the Iſland. It is ſaid that during his reſidence there, he was induced, upon a proſpect of important preferment, to aſſume the clerical function; but, that being diſappointed in his views, he reſigned that office before his return, to England, and has never ſince reſumed it. On his arrival here he purſued his original profeſſion, for ſeveral years, but, at laſt relinquiſhed it entirely. It is to be recorded to the credit of Dr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot's benevolence as well as diſcernment, that the art of painting is indebted to him for Mr. Opie. That artiſt was found by him in the Mines of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, where his genius firſt diſcovered itſelf to the Doctor, and he was encouraged by him to truſt for his future fortune to the cultivation of his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual capability.</p>

Few, indeed, have been the writings which have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in commanding ſo large a ſhare of attention as the detached pieces of Mr. Peter Pindar! Such was the demand for them, that a certain number of the London bookſellers agreed to allow him two hundred pounds per annum, for the excluſive privilege of ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his works! They are characteriſed by a ſpecies of humour, which, though not elegant and taſteful, is not deſtitute of nature, and is irreſiſtible in its power of exciting laughter. We conſider BOZZY AND PIOZZI, THE LOUSIAD, and PINDARIANA as the beſt among them; but have never contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated the character of this writer without a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſurprize and concern, that ſuch talents and attainments as his writings diſcover him to poſſeſs, ſhould never have been applied to better purpoſes than to a Iudicrous diſplay of his contempt of all decent reſpect, and to the compoſition of ſuch trifles, as muſt inevitably periſh with the age in which they were written.</p>

                  <p>Warden of Wincheſter College, and brother to the late celebrated poet laureat. A literary veteran of the greateſt diſtinction. We believe the earlieſt of his publications was an Ode on reading Weſt's Pindar, which appeared in 1749, and has been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſome other ſhort poetical pieces, among which is the Enthuſiaſt, or Lover of Nature. A year or two after the above date, he firſt publiſhed, in four volumes, octavo, the edition of Virgil, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by the name of WARTON's AND PITT's VIRGIL; adding to Virgil's original text
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0102600102:368"/>
and Mr. Pitt's tranſlation of the Aeneid, a new tranſlation of the Eclogues and Georgics with Notes on the whole by himſelf, and diſſertations Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays &amp;c. by himſelf and others. This edition of Virgil has been reprinted in four duodecimo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, as well as in octavo; and bears a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable eſtimation among learned men. With the merit of Mr. Pitt's Verſion of the Aeneid the world is well acquainted. Of Dr. Warton's Eclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues and Georgics it may be ſaid, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the ſenſe of their originals with greater exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perſpicuity than any other tranſlation we have; that their veſification is eaſy and harmonious and their ſtyle correct and pure: yet, if read for themſelves, they are inferior as pleaſing poems to the ſimilar performances of Dryden. About the ſame time with this publication, appeared alſo the firſt volume (in octavo) of Dr. Warton's cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Eſſay on the Genius and Writings of Pope. It was publiſhed anonymouſly, and the ſecond vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume did not make its appearance till 1782, though part of it was printed nearly twenty years before that time. This work, though not always in harmony with later opinions, is abundantly gratifying on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its learning, information, and juſt taſte. In 1797, Dr. Warton committed to the public the labour, as it is ſaid, of ſixteen years, in his long looked-for Edition of the Works of Pope, printed in in nine octavo volumes. The expectation which this work had excited in the literary world, was, in
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0102600102:369"/>
ſome meaſure, diſappointed on its appearance. It is one of the handſomeſt books which the modern elegance of typography has produced; but it is deformed by marks of haſte, unpardonable in ſuch an undertaking, and the commentary is little more than a ſelection of the beſt of Warburton's notes, combined with the correſponding parts of the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's before-mentioned ESSAY. Yet, though not ſo excellent a work of the kind as might be wiſhed for, it is certainly the beſt edition of Pope we have!</p>

                  <p>Lord Biſhop of Landaff, Archdeacon of Ely, Rector of Carſtil in Leiceſterſhire, and Regius Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Divinity in the Univerſity of Cambridge. A prelate diſtinguiſhed for his various and extenſive learning. His Lordſhip was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, was admitted to the degree of B. A. with diſtinguiſhed credit, in the year 1759, afterward became Prefeſſor of Chemiſtry in the Univerſity, and was elected to his preſent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſorſhip in 1771. During a reſidence of more than thirty years, he remained the glory of his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; at one time, by the ingenuity of his che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical reſearches; at another, as the pride of her divinity-chair. Of his Lordſhip's publications, the firſt was <hi>Inſtitutiones Metallurgicae,</hi> a tract, printed
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0102600102:371"/>
at Cambridge, in 1768, and intended as a text<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book for that part of his chemical lectures, which explained the properties of metallic ſubſtances. He wrote ſix more chemical tracts during his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Univerſity, the greater part of which appeared in the Philoſophical Tranſactions; and they were all afterward reprinted in the fifth volume of his Chemical Eſſays. His Lordſhip next publiſhed an Aſſize Sermon, preached at Cambridge, in 1769: which was followed by two Sermons preached at the ſame place, in the year 1776, the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which firſt made him known beyond the precincts of the Univerſity; one of them, entitled, "The Principles of the Revolution vindicated," de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered on the 29th of May; the other on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary of his Majeſty's Acceſſion in that year. Theſe diſcourſes, according to the ſentiments of their reſpective readers, were ſubjects of high commendation on one ſide, and of ſevere diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation on the other. In the ſame year Dr. Watſon alſo publiſhed, "An Apology for Chriſtianity." a duodecimo volume, conſiſting of a ſeries of letters to Mr. Gibbon; which, of all the anſwers made to the attacks of that gentleman, was the moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the moſt elegant, and, perhaps, the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. It is ſeldom, indeed, that controverſy has been conducted with ſo much becoming urbanity, and, at the ſame time, with ſo much ſpirit, as upon this occaſion. In 1780, Dr. Watſon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Sermon, preached before the Univerſity
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0102600102:372"/>
on the General Faſt, Feb. 4th, which was greatly admired; and alſo a Diſcourſe delivered to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Ely. The year following produced the two firſt volumes (in duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decimo) of thoſe "Chemical Eſſays" which have been ſo highly approved, and to which three more volumes were afterward added. They were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not with a view of giving a Syſtem of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry to the world, but to convey, in a popular manner, a general kind of knowledge to perſons not much verſed in chemical enquiries.</p>
                  <p>Having been tutor to the late Duke of Rutland, while His Grace reſided at Cambridge, Dr. Watſon was appointed, through the intereſt of the Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land family, under the adminiſtration of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Lanſdown, in 1782, to the Biſhopric of Landaff. Immediately upon his promotion, his Lordſhip publiſhed a Letter to the (late) Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, recommending a new diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the church revenues, by which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprics ſhould be rendered equal to each other in value, and the ſmaller livings be ſo far increaſed in income, by a proportional deduction from the richer endowments, as to render them a decent competency. This letter produced ſeveral pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets at the preſs, among which was a Letter to the Biſhop from Mr. Richard Cumberland (vide that name). Dr. Watſon's ſubſequent publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been, beſide a few occaſionial ſingle Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, a valuable Collection of Theological Tracts,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0102600102:373"/>
in ſix large octavo volumes, publiſhed in 1785; an octavo volume of Sermons and Tracts, publiſhed in 1788, and conſiſting chiefly of his ſmaller pieces which had been publiſhed ſeparately before that time, as already enumerated; three Charges deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Clergy of the Dioceſe of Landaff; an Addreſs to young Perſons after Confirmation, a pamphlet, which had been annexed to the firſt of his Charges; Conſiderations on the Expediency of Reviſing the Liturgy and Articles of the Church of England, a pamphlet, publiſhed in 1790; and "An Apology for the Bible," in anſwer to Paine's AGE OF REASON, Part II. Among theſe, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Sermon for the Weſtminſter Diſpenſary, preached in 1785, and publiſhed with an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Appendix, in 1793; as well as his moſt ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſtrong, judicious, and beautiful APOLOGY for the Bible, are peculiarly entitled to commendation.</p>
                  <p>As a writer, Dr. Watſon has united with almoſt unexampled grace, the knowledge of a ſcholar with the liberality of a gentleman, the warm piety of a true chriſtian, and the open manlineſs of a well-intending character. It has been ſaid, perhaps, with truth, that he is not a ſtranger to the pride of rank, that he is not deaf to the whiſpers of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and that he feels with anguiſh the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of diſappointment: he has, moreover, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf not a little conſpicuous by his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the meaſures of adminiſtration.

His firſt publication was a Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Mancheſter, in two volumes, quarto, the firſt of which appeared in 1771. It is writen upon a very elaborate plan, but has obtained many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, both as a work of ingenuity and acuteneſs,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0102600102:378"/>
and of elegance and imagination. In 1772, Mr. Whitaker publiſhed "The genuine Hiſtory of the Britons aſſerted," an octavo volume, in refutation of Macpherſon's INTRODUCTION TO THE HIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORY OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND; and in which he diſplayed an evident ſuperiority over his adverſary. His next publication was a ſmall octavo volume of Sermons upon Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell, which was printed in 1783, and has been generally thought to have added little to his reputation as an author. This was followed in 1787, by his three octavo volumes, entitled, "Mary Queen of Scots vindicated," which cloſed the controverſy reſpecting that Princeſs, by a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her innocence. Although Mr. Whitaker had been preceded on the ſame ſide of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the reſearches of Mr. Goodal, the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mr. Tytler, and, above all, by the genius of Dr. Gilbert Stuart, he found means to diſcover ſome new materials for the defence of his heroine. The <hi>matter,</hi> indeed, of this publication is excellent throughout, but the <hi>manner</hi> is often highly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible. The ſubſequent productions of Mr. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aker have been, a Review of Mr. Gibbon's Hiſtory, Vols. IV. V. and VI. which had originally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Engliſh Review; "The Origin of Arianiſm diſcloſed," a large controverſial tract in which there is an uncommon diſplay of learning and judgement; "The Courſe of Hannibal over the Alps aſcertained," a very curious inveſtigation, in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0102600102:379"/>
two octavo volumes; and "The real Origin of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment," a very ſingular pamphlet. Mr. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aker was alſo a very material contributor to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which the Engliſh Review could, at one time, boaſt; and has written ſome Poems in the Collection publiſhed by Gentlemen of Devonſhire and Cornwall. His vices as a writer are, a general inequality, and an occaſional appearance of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſive affectation, in his ſtyle; too ſtrong a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to conjectural reaſoning; and, ſometimes, too apparent a ſelf-ſatisfaction in his own performances.

Dr. White was openly attacked with a charge to this purpoſe, by Dr. Gabriel of the Octagon Chapel, Bath; and a literary controverſy enſued which produced ſeveral pamphlets at the preſs. Dr. White was, at length, induced to publiſh a ſtatement of the caſe, by which it appeared that literary and pecuniary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations had reciprocally ſubſiſted between Mr. Badcock and himſelf; and that the Sermons had received additional brilliancy from the maſterly pen of Dr. Parr.

                  <head>WILLIAMS, DAVID.</head>
                  <p>A native of Glamorganſhire. He was originally a diſſenting miniſter at Exeter and afterward preached for many years to a ſmall congregation at Highgate. Here he changed his principles, and,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0102600102:386"/>
being ſuſpected, relinquiſhed the miniſterial charge and adopted that of private tuition. While at Highgate, he preached a courſe of Sermons on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Hypocriſy, which he publiſhed in two duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decimo volumes. In 1770, he wrote a poignant Letter to Mr. Garrick, on his conduct and talents, as manager and performer; which was followed by polemical dialogues, entitled "The Philoſopher." When the Unitarian Clergy met at the Feathers Tavern to petition relief from ſubſcribing the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the able pen of Mr. Williams was ſolicited in their ſervice; he accordingly drew up ſome Eſſays on Public Worſhip, Projects of Reformation, &amp;c. which were found to contain ſentiments of ſo DEISTICAL a complexion that he was, at once, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by the people whom he had deſigned to ſerve. Theſe Eſſays he publiſhed, and afterward added to them an Appendix, principally levelled at the Diſſenters, upon whoſe conduct he was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly ſevere. Mr. Williams now totally forſook the connection of the Diſſenters, and became an avowed advocate of deiſm, as well as of democracy. In 1774, the time of his eſtabliſhing a private ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary at Chelſea, he publiſhed a Treatiſe on Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in a duodecimo volume, which contains ſome uncommonly acute and judicious remarks on that ſubject, while it too fully diſcloſes the change in his principles with reſpect to revealed religion. Two years after this date, Mr. Williams opened a Chapel in Margaret Street, Cavendiſh Square, on
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0102600102:387"/>
the univerſal principles of Natural Religion, a ſcheme to which he was inſtigated by Dr. Franklin. Dignified with the appellation, <hi>Prieſt of Nature,</hi> he officiated here for about four years, and thus finally terminated his exiſtence in a clerical capacity; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſequently employed his talents, which are unqueſtionably great, chiefly in the compoſition of political and deiſtical writings. Beſide the works already mentioned, he has publiſhed a Sermon, preached at the opening of his Chapel in Margaret Street; a Liturgy for that Chapel; "The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Extent of Intellectual Liberty," a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet; a Plan of Aſſociation on Conſtitutional Principles, a pamphlet written at the time of the riots in London; Letters on Political Liberty, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the county meetings and aſſociations in 1782; Lectures on Religion and Morality, in two volumes, quarto; Lectures on Education, in three volumes, octavo; Lectures on Political Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in an octavo volume; and a Hiſtory of Monmouthſhire, in a quarto volume.

This was followed by ſome other pretty poetical Pieces, which were reprinted in a Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in two duodecimo volumes, publiſhed by ſubſcription, in 1786; among which the hiſtorical poem, entitled, "Peru," and the Fragment found in a dark paſſage of the Tower, have peculiar merit. In 1788, Miſs Williams publiſhed a Poem on the Slave-trade Bill; and, two years afterward, a well written novel, entitled, "Julia." She went to France, for the ſecond time, in the year 1791, and has, ſince then, reſided at Paris.

                  <p>Of Trinity College, Cambridge. A gentleman of very diſtinguiſhed talents and attainments. He was, formerly a member of Magdalen College, and removed to Trinity Hall on the proſpect of ſucceeding to a very deſirable ſituation. After ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring honours almoſt unprecedented in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, he was rejected, when the looked-for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy was made, on the moſt pitiful and ſhameful pretences, and, with a ſpirit becoming his high deſert and its ſcandalous requital, left the ſociety in the utmoſt deteſtation of its principles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Mr. Wrangham has, ſince that time, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained church preferment in the county of York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. His publications have been confined to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0102600102:398"/>
"Reform," a farce, modernized from Ariſtophanes by S. Foote, jun. in which Chremylus and Plutus are tranſlated by Thomas Paine and John Bull; and "The Reſtoration of the Jews," a Seatonian Prize poem. Both of theſe are highly creditable to his talents and his years.</p>

                  <p>A writer of very diſtinguiſhed merit, whoſe works have been peculiarly approved. He has been a member in ſeveral Parliaments, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his ſeat for the Borough of Wallingford in Berkſhire, in the year 1794. Mr. Wraxall's firſt publication was an octavo volume of "Curſory Remarks" in a Tour through ſome of the Northern Parts of Europe. This made its appearance in 1775; and was followed, two years afterward, by Memoirs of the Kings of France of the Race of Valois, in two octavo volumes, a work which was republiſhed, in 1785, with many additions, under the title, "The Hiſtory of France under the Kings of the Race of Valois." Mr. Wraxall has alſo publiſhed a Tour through the Weſtern, Southern, and Interior Provinces of France, in a duodecimo volume, originally annexed to the above-mentioned MEMOIRS; the Hiſtory of France from the Acceſſion of Henry III. to the Death of

                  <p>As a traveller, he is well known to be a lively and ſenſible obſerver of men and manners; as an Hiſtorian he has alſo given proofs of great ability and talents.</p>

Mr. Wyvill has publiſhed a Viſitation Sermon, preached at Kelvedon, in 1772; Thoughts on the Articles of our Religion, a pamphlet; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſional political Pamphlets, chiefly on the ſubject of Parliamentary Reform; and a Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Political Papers on the ſame ſubject, in three volumes, octavo.

Her poetical talent was diſcoverd by Mrs. Hannah More, who ſolicited for her the protection, of Mrs. Montagu, in a prefatory Letter prefixed to a collection of her poems, publiſhed (in quarto) in 1785. Two years after this, Mrs. Yearſley pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed another collection of Poems, in quarto; and has, ſince that time, written a Poem on the Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of the Slave-trade; "Stanzas of Woe;" Earl Goodwin, an hiſtorical play, performed at Briſtol; and the Royal Captives, a novel of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable merit, in four volumes, duodecimo. She has experienced great encouragement from the Public in her literary undertakings; but has unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately had a diſpute with her original patroneſs which was carried, on both ſides, to a diſguſting exceſs.

                  <head>YOUNG, ARTHUR, ESQ. F.R.S.</head>
                  <p>Secretary to the Board of Agriculture, Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Member of ſeveral Societies at home and abroad, and a writer chiefly conſpicuous on Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultural Subjects. Mr. Young was born at Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field in Eſſex, being a younger ſon of a good family reſident on that ſpot for nearly two centuries. He began his farming purſuits upon the land which he, at preſent, occupies, about the year 1761; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided afterward, for nine years, in Hertfordſhire, and then returned to his native place. In the years 1776-1779, he made journies to Ireland; and, on an invitation from M. Lazowſki, to accompany him and Count de la Rochefoucauld to the Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees, made his firſt journey into France in 1787. Mr. Young returned to England in the winter of the ſame year, and attended the Wool Bill then before our Parliament, after which he made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond tour to France, and finiſhed his travels in 1789.</p>
                  <p>Of Mr. Young's publications, the firſt was an octavo volume, entitled, "The Farmer's Letters, &amp;c." which appeared in 1767, and to which a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond volume was, ſome years afterward, added. His ſubſequent productions have been, "A ſix weeks Tour through the Southern Counties of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Wales," in an octavo volume; an Eſſay

                  <p>Though the agricultural purſuits of Mr. Young have been highly laudable, his publications in this claſs have not been flattered with a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion peculiarly kind, and his judgement on thoſe ſubjects has been frequently diſapproved. In <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical arithmetic</hi> he has deſervedly gained conſiderable eminence; and his TRAVELS in France, in which his purſuit was not agriculture, but political oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, have been very eagerly read and highly approved.</p>

The ſtyle of this work is incorrect, complicated, and uncouth, but it is full of imagination, reflexion, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. In 1788, Sir William Young publiſhed a pamphlet on Mr. Gilbert's propoſed Amendment of the Poor Laws; and he has written, ſince that time, "The Rights of Engliſhmen," a pamphlet; and a Letter to Mr. Pitt on the ſubject of Poor Houſes and Work Houſes. A Speech on the Slave-trade, deliverd by him in Parliament, in 1791, has alſo reached the preſs; and he has edited, and prefixed a Life of the author, to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatio Philoſophica,</hi> a poſthumous work of Dr. Brook Taylor, printed in an octavo volume, but not publiſhed.</p>
