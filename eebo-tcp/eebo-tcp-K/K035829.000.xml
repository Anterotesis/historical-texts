            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR treatment to me has been ſo ſingularly kind and liberal, that it would be inflicting the ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on my pride, to oblige me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it from the world. I had been taught to believe, that without a patron amongſt the great, or an eſtabliſhed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary ſame, it was next to an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to get a piece introduced on the ſtage: but you, Sir, have proved to me, that this complaint is groundleſs: tho' unknown and unprotected, your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to me has been ſuch as the moſt delicate mind could ſuggeſt, or the moſt powerful influence have procured me. If then you countenance thus warmly ſo humble a tribute as mine at the ſhrine of the muſes, how much ſuperior at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention muſt you beſtow on the more elevated and ſublime efforts of the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0666400300:3"/>
mind, when Thalia comes arrayed by the hand of Genius with reſiſtleſs graces, or her weeping ſiſter, in native fables with all the conflicting paſſions in her train. The encouragement you give to every dawn of talents, whilſt it wins you the reſpect and eſteem of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, muſt prove of the moſt eſſential ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the cauſe of letters. Patronage and ſucceſs often lend a degree of force and brilliancy to moderate abilities; but ripen a truly fine genius into immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate perfection. I have the honour to remain,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PUBLIC taſte has run ſo much of late on the French <hi>petite comedie</hi> of two <hi>acts,</hi> that it ſeems neceſſary to ſay ſomething in juſtification of <hi>farce,</hi> to prevent its being tried by the too rigid rules of criticiſm. In this refined age, <hi>low</hi> and <hi>abſurd,</hi> are terms of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach heard to echo from the benches of the upper gallery; ſo that whoever attempts to raiſe a laugh by downright <hi>farce,</hi> muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect critics in all quarters of the houſe ready to damn him for attempting to put them in good humour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Farce</hi> has ever been conſidered ſo eſſentially different from <hi>comedy,</hi> that any incident in the latter bordering upon the <hi>extravagant,</hi> has been termed <hi>farcical</hi> or <hi>outré</hi> by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination. This ſpecies of entertainment is certainly more a <hi>caricature</hi> than a <hi>faithful picture of nature</hi>—the outline is preſerved but extended, and every tint of the colouring conſiderably heightened. For inſtance—can any thing be more improbable and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, than the plot and incidents of the Mock Doctor? yet this has been the production of two of the firſt comic geniuſſes this or any other country ever produced. It is not to be ſuppoſed that Moliere and Fielding were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the rules of the drama; nevertheleſs, in their beſt farces they totally loſt fight of them, appearing to have nothing in view but whimſical characters and laughable ſituations.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0666400300:5"/>
The humour and characters of <hi>the Invaſion</hi> in ſome places have been cenſured as low, but ſurely the ſame charge holds good againſt the the moſt celebrated writers. Smollett, Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Gay, Cervantes, all deſcended to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble walk of life in ſearch of Humour, and never rejected her for the homelineſs of her garb. It is true, that if painting low life be a fault, thoſe diſtinguiſhed wits were poſſeſſed of beauties ſufficient to eclipſe little ſpots in their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The writer of <hi>the Invaſion</hi> feels but too ſenſibly the humiliating diſtance he is thrown from them, and, that whatever his faults are, he has nothing to depend upon for hiding them except the candour of his readers. The following little entertainment he meant merely as a <hi>farce,</hi> and as ſuch <hi>only</hi> he hopes it will be conſidered and judged of.</p>
            <p>He cannot conclude without returning his warmeſt acknowledgments to Mr. Garrick for aſſiſtances in the Invaſion, which have contributed more than the merit of the author to its ſucceſs with the public.</p>
            <p>The performers in general acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the greateſt ſpirit and propriety; particularly Mr. Lee Lewes, who, by his ſpeaking the prologue and his acting Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, proved that he was poſſeſſed of all thoſe various and verſatile powers which conſtitute the truly capital comedian.</p>

                  <p>Lord, your Ladyſhip, it was Sir John and his ſervants that made all that racket and uproar—He has got a ſerjeant and a drummer from Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmſtone to teach him his exerciſe—If your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip was to ſee him, and Roger the carter, and William the poſtillion, marching and deſiling about, and turning out their toes, and handling their arms, you'd die with laughing. As ſure as can be, the poor gentleman is not right in his mind—the thoughts of this invaſion has turn'd his brain.</p>

                  <p>Now we only want a couple of field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces, and our review will be complete.</p>

                  <p>Have you ever a pair of jack boots in the houſe?—I think we might make a ſhift with them.</p>

                  <speaker>Drill.</speaker>
                  <p>Damme, I'll engage for them as well as if they had tower mark on—I'll tell you a ſtory of a jack boot—The firſt battle I was ever in, being a mere boy, as a man may ſay, you muſt know I was deviliſhly frightened; but a good-natur'd grenadier obſerving my confuſion, whips me off a jack boot from the leg of a trooper, whoſe brains were juſt blown out, and intrench'd me up to the chin in it, in the twirling of a ramrod: as ſoon as I found myſelf, Sir, ſafely garriſoned in the boot, I bent my knees, to take every advantage of my poſt, and damn me if I did not maintain it with the greateſt ſteadineſs till the battle was over, without receiving a ſingle wound but one, and where do you think that was?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir J.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps in the toes—that part of a jack boot I know is apt to go firſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Drill.</speaker>
                  <p>It was in the lace of the hind ſirk of my hat, which happen'd to be too much expoſed above the boot to the fire of the enemy.—What do you think of a jack boot now?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tat.</speaker>
                  <p>Probable, Sir! if he gets any body to ſay it is true but himſelf, I'll ſuffer my braces to be cut on a review day, and be content with the black hole for my dining-room.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Drill.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, you raſcal, you know I can't; the entire corps I belonged to were all cut to pieces; therefore he knows I have not a witneſs living to confront him.</p>

                  <p>Yes, but I have changed my mind; the fellow was mean enough to prefer fighting with words and parchment in Weſtminſter Hall, to the glorious danger of the field of battle.

ſuch violence againſt her fore teeth, that the whole ſet bounced into her lap in a twinkling—Every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtared, not ſo much at the accident (as it was one might have happened to moſt of themſelves) as at the prodigious alteration it made in Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—her cheeks which appeared as round and as plump as a peach, ſhrunk into wrinkles, her lips fell in, her noſe and chin approached, and from a fine blooming girl of five and twenty—before the cloth was removed, ſhe was hagged into an antiquated maiden of threeſcore.</p>

                  <p>You muſt excuſe, me, Sir; my fortune as well as yours, depends upon thoſe bonds—If I give them up, Sir John will never give you his daughter, and I ſhall loſe my reward.</p>
