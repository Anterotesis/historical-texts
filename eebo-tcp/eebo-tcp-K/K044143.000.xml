            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO <hi>DAVID GARRICK,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AMIDST the regrets I feel for your quitting the Stage, it is peculiarly gratifying, that a Play of <hi>mine</hi> cloſes your <hi>dramatic</hi> life—It is the higheſt pleaſure to me, that <hi>that</hi> Play, from its ſucceſs, reflects no diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on your judgement as a Manager.</p>
            <p>Poſterity will know, thro' a thouſand Channels, that Mr. GARRICK was the ornament of the eighteenth Century, that he poſſeſſed the friendſhip of thoſe whoſe Names will be the glory of Engliſh Hiſtory, that the firſt ranks in the kingdom courted his ſociety—may my ſmall voice be heard amongſt thoſe who will inform it, that Mr. GARRICK's <hi>Heart</hi> was no leſs an honour to him, than his <hi>Talents!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unpatronized by any <hi>name,</hi> I preſented myſelf to you, obſcure and unknown. You perceived <hi>dawnings</hi> in my Comedy, which you <hi>nouriſh'd</hi> and <hi>improved.</hi> With at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and ſollicitude, you <hi>embelliſh'd,</hi> and preſented it to the world<hi>—that</hi> World, which has emulated your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, and received it with an applauſe, which fills my heart with moſt lively gratitude. I perceive how much of this applauſe I owe to my <hi>Sex.—</hi>The RUNAWAY has a thouſand faults, which, if written by a Man, would have incurred the ſevereſt laſh of Criticiſm—but the Gallantry of the Engliſh Nation is equal to its Wiſdom—they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb facs="tcp:0295300800:2"/>
a <hi>Woman</hi> tracing with feeble ſteps the borders of the Parnaffian Mount—pitying her difficulties (for 'tis a thorny path) they gave their hands for her ſupport, and placed her <hi>high</hi> above her level.</p>
            <p>All this, Sir, and whatever may be its conſequences, I owe to you. Had you rejected me, when I preſented my little RUNAWAY, depreſſed by the refuſal, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in <hi>myſelf</hi> deſtroyed, I ſhould never have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to dip my pen again. It is now my taſk to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince You and the World, that a generous allowance for a young Writer's faults, is the beſt encouragement to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius—'tis a kindly Soil, in which weak Groundlings are nouriſh'd, and from which the loftieſt Trees draw their ſtrength, and their beauty.</p>
            <p>I take my leave of you, Sir, with the warmeſt wiſhes for your felicity, and Mrs. GARRICK's—to whoſe <hi>taſte,</hi> and ſollicitede for me, I am highly indebted. May your receſs from the Stage be attended with all the bleſſings of retirement and eaſe—and may the world remember, in its moſt diſtant periods, that 'tis to Mr. GARRICK the Engliſh Theatre owes its emancipation from groſſneſs, and buffoonery—that to Mr. GARRICK's <hi>Judgement</hi> it is indebted for being the firſt Stage in Europe, and to his <hi>Talents</hi> for being the delight of the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and poliſh'd age.</p>

               <l>Nor Ariſtotle knows, nor ſcarce a rule</l>
               <l>By which fine writers fabricate their plays,</l>
               <l>From ſage Menander's, to theſe modern days:</l>
               <l>How ſhe could venture here I am aſtoniſh'd;</l>
               <l>But 'twas in vain the Mad-cap I admoniſh'd;</l>
               <l>Told her of ſqueaking cat-calls, hiſſes, groans,</l>
               <l>Off, offs, and ruthleſs Critics' damning moans.</l>
               <l>I'm undiſmay'd, ſhe cry'd, critics are Men,</l>
               <l>And ſmile on folly from a Woman's pen:</l>
               <l>Then 'tis the Ladies' cauſe, there I'm ſecure;</l>
               <l>Let him who hiſſes, no ſoft Nymph endure;</l>
               <l>May he who frowns, be frown'd on by his Goddeſs,</l>
               <l>From Pearls, and Bruſſels Point, to Maids in Boddice.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Now for a hint of her intended feaſt:</l>
               <l>'Tis rural, playful,—harmleſs 'tis at leaſt;</l>

               <l>From the ſurrounding hints ſhe caught her plan,</l>
               <l>Length'ning the chain from infancy to man:</l>
               <l>Tom plagues poor Fan; ſhe ſobs, but loves him ſtill;</l>

               <l>Her fancy glow'd, and colour'd them—for you;</l>
               <l>A Mother's pencil gave the light and ſhades,</l>

               <l>Then Tom ſhall have his kite, and Fan new dollies,</l>

                  <p>OH, for the luxury of night-gown and ſlippers! No jaded hack of Parnaſſus can be more tired than I am—the roads ſo duſty, and the ſun ſo hot—'twould be leſs intolerable riding poſt in Africa.</p>

                  <p>What a wild imagination!—But in the name of Fortune, why are you alone? What have you done with all the College youths?—This is the firſt vacation you ever came home unaccompanied, and I aſſure you <hi>we</hi> are quite diſappointed.</p>

                  <p>A notable victory indeed!—however, his name ſerves to make a figure in the liſts of one's conqueſts, and ſo you may give him juſt hope enough to feed his ſighs,—but not to encourage his preſumption.</p>

                  <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>Seymour! Ho, ho! Very fine truly! <stage>[aſide.]</stage> If Seymour be the man, my Siſter, ſet your heart at reſt—he is on the point of marriage, <hi>if I am not miſtaken,</hi> with a fine blooming Girl, not more than eighteen.—Soft, dove-like eyes—pouting lips—teeth that were, doubtleſs, made of oriental pearl—a neck—I want a ſimile now—ivory, wax, alabaſter!—no; they won't do.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>A fine Woman, Harriet, gives warmth to all around her—She is that univerſal ſpirit, about which Philoſophers talk; the true point of attraction that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns Nature, and controuls the univerſe of Man.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Heiday, George! Did the charms of Lady Dinah inſpire this rhapſody?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>Charms! What, of that antiquated, ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, delicate Lady, who bleſs'd us with her long ſpeeches at dinner?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt learn to be more reſpectful in your epithets, Sir; for that ſententious, delicate Lady deſigns you the honour of becoming your Mother.</p>

                  <speaker>Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſhall judge.—We met her in our late viſit to Bath—She renewed her acquaintance with your Father, with whom, in Mrs. Hargrave's life-time, ſhe had been intimate—He invited her to return with us, and ſhe has been here this month—They are frequently

cloſeted together—She has <hi>forty thouſand pounds,</hi> and is Siſter to an Iriſh Peer.</p>

                  <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>She might have been Grandmother to the Peer, by the days ſhe has numbered—But her exceſſive propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and decorum overcome me—How can they agree with my father's vociferation, October, and hounds?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, I aſſure you, wondrouſly well—ſhe kiſſes Jowler, takes Ringwood on her lap, and has, more than once, ſipp'd out of your Father's tankard.—Delicacies, Couſin, are eaſily made to give way, when we have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ends to anſwer.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>Very true; and beware of that period, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies <hi>muſt</hi> give way—tremble at the hour, Bella, when you'll riſe from the labours of your toilette with no end in view, but the conqueſt of ſome Quixote Galant in his grand climacteric—on whom you'll ſquander more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging glances, than all the ſighs and ardor of two and twenty can extort from you now.</p>

                     <hi>Memento mori!</hi> Quite a College compliment: you ought rather to have ſuppoſed that my power will increaſe; and that, like Ninon, I might give myſelf the airs of eighteen at eighty—But here's John coming to ſummon us to coffee.—Harriet!</p>

He never profeſs'd to love me—Oh yes, his ardent looks—his ſighs—his conſuſion—his reſpectful attentions, have a thouſand times profeſs'd the ſtrongeſt paſſion—Surely, a man cannot in honour, be exculpated, who by ſuch methods defrauds a Woman of her heart; even tho' the <hi>word</hi> Love ſhould never paſs his lips.

                  <p>Indeed I have not—I confeſs I was ſo weak, as to retire twice from the drawing-room, becauſe I heard his voice—tho' I was conſcious my abſence muſt appear odd, and fearful the cauſe might be ſuſpected.</p>

                  <p>That is, ſhe would make him a Court Dangler, an attendant on Miniſters levees—one whoſe ambition is to be foſtered with the cameleon food of ſmiles and nods, and who would receive a familiar ſqueeze with as much rapture as the plaudits of a nation—oh—ſhame—to transform an independent Engliſh Gentleman into ſuch a being!</p>
