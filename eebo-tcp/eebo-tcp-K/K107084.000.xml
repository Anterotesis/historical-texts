            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Make no queſtion, but that all thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who ſhall happen to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Newneſs and Boldneſs of the Poſitions, which are the ſubject of the following Treatiſe, will accuſe me of want of Judgment, not only for advancing 'em, but for daring to bring 'em under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of ſo diſcerning a Judge as your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0391600400:3"/>
But I deſire thoſe Gentlemen to believe, that if I had had a mind that my faults ſhould have lain conceal'd, or would have conſulted my own more than the publick advantage, your Lordſhip is the perſon to whom of all mankind I would laſt have choſen to have addreſs'd them. That tho you had never writ your admirable Eſſay, I ſhould have been convinc'd by your other Poems, and particularly by your <hi>Temple of Death</hi>; a Temple that is conſecrated at the ſame time to Death and to Immortality, of your perfect knowledge in Criticiſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have experience enough to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that there never was a great Poet in the world, who was not an accompliſh'd Critick. <hi>Horace,</hi> who was one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, was in the firſt Rank of Judges, and <hi>Virgil</hi> has taken care to tranſmit to poſterity one of the exacteſt pieces of Criticiſm that ever was writ in the world; tho indeed it is a Criticiſm by Examples only, of which <hi>Boſſu</hi> vouchſaf'd to write the Rules above ſixteen hundred years afterwards.</p>
            <p>Thus, my Lord, I am ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your Character to approach you with awe; but at the ſame time I am convinc'd that they are miſtaken, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the moſt Diſcerning are the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:4"/>
Rigid Judges. I am ſatisfied that a Write has a great deal of reaſon to be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of half Criticks, who are govern'd by opinion, or guided by prejudice, or ſway'd by partial affection; and who ſee faults but in ſome places, and at ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular times; for ſuch Cenſors are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable to the leaſt of our Errors. But your Lordſhip, whoſe unclouded Underſtanding ſees all our faults, where-ever they are, and who knows how difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, it is for us not to err, will make large allowances for the Imperfections of Humane Nature, or our particular frailties, if you diſcover in us the appearance of any good quality, which may beſpeak your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. Imperfect, partial, prejudic'd Criticks have Judgment enough to Diſcover Faults, but want Diſcernment to find out Beauties; or if at any time by chance they Diſcover them, they are perhaps too inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, or too envious, or too fearful to own them. But as Nature, that has given you ſo many extraordinary qualities, has conſpir'd with Fortune, in ſetting your Lordſhip infinitely above ſo mean a Paſſion as Envy; ſo ſhe has plac'd you as far above the Imperious ſway of opinion, that madly tyrannizes over the multitude. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip never approves of our actions becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:5"/>
they have met with ſucceſs, but becauſe they deſerve to ſucceed. And here I humbly deſire of your Lordſhip, that in behalf of all the Lovers of Poetry, I may return you thanks for the Protection and Patronage of a great man deceas'd. 'Tis known to all the obſerving world, that you generouſly began to eſpouſe him, when he was more than half oppreſt by a very formidable party in the Court of King <hi>Charles II.</hi> a faction that wanted neither Power nor Authority to cruſh him; who, beſides that they held the foremoſt Rank in the State, had got poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the minds of the people, with whom they had acquir'd a great Reputation, for their Knowledge and Capacity in matters of Wit and Criticiſm. If that great man had faults, your Lordſhip wanted no Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to find them; but you wanted malice, partiality, prejudice, and the reſt of thoſe ungenerous obſtacles, that hindred others from diſcovering or confeſſing his Beauties. Your Lordſhip eaſily found that he had Beauties which over-weigh'd all faults; and it was that conſideration that engag'd you to  ſupport him againſt his powerful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. They, upon an unaccountable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which they had taken to his perſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> have oppreſt his growing merit; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> conſideration of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, cheriſh'd his perſon, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:6"/>
his pretended frailties; and while others, to expreſs their malice to the man, would have hindred the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even of that Art which they pretended to eſteem ſo much; your Lordſhip, on the contrary, by a wiſe, a good natur'd, and a noble proceeding, cheriſh'd the man on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make him inſtrumental in advancing the Art. And as it was after you took him into your protection, that he writ ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his moſt valuable pieces, 'tis to your Lordſhip that the world is in ſome meaſure indebted for the greater number of his excellencies.</p>
            <p>And with the ſame greatneſs of mind, with which to advance a noble Art, you rais'd and ſupported a man oppreſs'd by very powerful adverſaries; ſo in order to the ſame deſign, you pull'd down the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of publick prejudice, and of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant opinion. For 'tis known to all the world, that your Lordſhip declar'd againſt the Obſcenity which was ſhamefully crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poetry; at a time when not only that way of writing, but the Verſes which you particularly hinted at, were in the very height of their Reputation. But the ſucceſs was anſwerable to the nobleneſs of your Lordſhips attempt; thoſe Verſes have gradually declin'd ever ſince in their
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:7"/>
Reputation, and nothing of that nature will now be ſuffer'd by any but the Rabble. So that your Lordſhip has done a very ſignal kindneſs not only to a noble Art, but to Vertue itſelf, and have highly oblig'd all vertuous men as well as lovers of Poetry.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have mentioned this the more willingly, becauſe it fairly gives me an opportunity of confirming by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Authority, the aſſertion which is the foundation of the following Treatiſe; which is, that Religion gives a very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the exciting of Paſſion in Poetry. Your Lordſhip has inform'd us, that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenity and Poetry are things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent. The aſſertion muſt be granted by all to be unqueſtionably true; for nothing can be poſſibly conſiſtent with an Art, which runs counter to the very end and deſign of that Art. Now the end of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is to Inſtruct and Reform, and Obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in writing corrupts the manners. But this on the other ſide is not to be doubted, that Verſes may be produc'd from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets, which are at once Obſcene and Poetical; tho at the ſame time it muſt be confeſt, that they would have been more fine, if they had been more chaſte. But if any one demands why Ribaldry ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Ancient Poetry, when
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:8"/>
it is ſo plainly inſufferable in the Modern; to him I anſwer, that it can be nothing but the Religion of the Ancients which makes the difference; for theirs was very conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with Obſcenity, whereas ours entirely abhors it. A way of writing that was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd by their Religion, could never be ſaid to be utterly inconſiſtent with inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Beſides, Paſſion is the principal thing in Poetry, and tho Obſcenity has ſomething too groſs and fulſom in it, to conſiſt with the Delicacy of a tender Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet by mingling with their Obſcene Verſes, their <hi>Cupid,</hi> their <hi>Venus,</hi> and the reſt of their Amorous Divinities, they had the advantage of that other ſort of Paſſion which we call Enthuſiaſm; whereas the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of our Religion being utterly abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of any thing which is impure, ſuch Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldry inſerted in our Poetry can never poſſibly either inſtruct or move.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of what your Lordſhip has done to advance Poetry, has oblig'd me to lay the following Treatiſe at your feet; a Preſent, I confeſs, that is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of you, but it is by much the moſt valuable that either I have, or ever have had to make; and your Lordſhip has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it with the ſame goodneſs that the <hi>Perſian</hi> King did the Apple: He ſaw that
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:9"/>
it was all that his Subject could do to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his acknowledgment; and for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon it was more agreeable to him, than the vain pompous Preſents of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd they could add to his Treaſure. I believ'd that the very Deſign to improve an Art, which your Lordſhip has actually ſo much advanc'd, would prevail upon your goodneſs to excuſe a great many faults, which you may find in the following Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>But upon mentioning the Deſign of the enſuing Diſcourſe, I find my ſelf ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplex'd. There are ſeveral things of the laſt importance that ought to be prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to the Diſcourſe itſelf: And I find that I have ſtrong temptations upon me of following Mr <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Example, and of ſaying to your Lordſhip, what is uſually directed to the Reader in general. But then I conſider that I have neither Mr <hi>Dryden's</hi> great qualities, nor like him a Reputation long eſtabliſh'd, nor, what ought chiefly to be conſider'd, the Honour of having often approach'd your Lordſhip, to authorize ſuch a Liberty. But yet on the other ſide, the things that I have to ſay are of important conſequence to the good of the Cauſe which I have undertaken; and I find that I ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>ting to that noble Cauſe, if I ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf to the Reader in general; and
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:10"/>
I ſhould be thought by all diſcerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to proceed as abſurdly, as would a Lawyer, who upon a ſolemn pleading, ſhould apply himſelf to the Multitude, who have little knowledge of his affair, and no Authority to determine it; inſtead of ſpeaking to his Awful Judge, who has a perfect knowledge of his Cauſe, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority to decide it.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of all Poetical Criticiſm, muſt be, if it is juſt and good, to advance ſo uſeful and ſo noble an Art as Poetry. And the deſign of the following Treatiſe is no leſs than to ſet the Moderns upon an equal foot with even admir'd Antiquity. In order to the doing which, I humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire leave of your Lordſhip, that I may make an enquiry in what the preheminence of the Ancient Poets conſiſts; and why I prefer one of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Tragedies, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Oedipus</hi> of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> to one of our celebrated <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tragedies; as for inſtance, the <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi> Upon reflection I find that the reaſon is, becauſe I am more delighted and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the former; and that for this very reaſon, becauſe I am more mov'd by it: For I find by experience that I am no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleas'd nor inſtructed by any Tragedy, than as it excites Paſſion in me. But in
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:11"/>
order to the diſcovering why I am more mov'd by the former than the latter of thoſe Tragedies, I deſire leave to make an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the principal differences between them, and that in all probability will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the matter. I find then, my Lord, that there are two very ſignal differences between the <hi>Oedipus</hi> and the <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> Firſt, the <hi>Oedipus</hi> is exactly Juſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and the <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> is very Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and Irregular. Secondly, the <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> is very Religious, and the <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> is Irreligious. For, with ſubmiſſion to your Lordſhips Judgment, I conceive that every Tragedy ought to be a very ſolemn Lecture, inclucating a particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſhowing it plainly protecting the good, and chaſtizing the bad, or at leaſt the violent; and that if it is otherwiſe, it is either an empty amuſement, or a ſcandalous and pernicious Libel upon the government of the world. The killing of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> is either a Murder or a Lawful Action; if the killing <hi>Caeſar</hi> is a, Lawful Action, then the killing of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> is downright Murder; and the Poet has been guilty of polluting the Seene with the blood of the very beſt and laſt of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But if the killing of <hi>Caeſar</hi> is Murder, and <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0391600400:12"/>
are very juſtly puniſh'd for it; then <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi> is on the other ſide anſwerable for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing ſo many Noble <hi>Romans,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting in the open face of an Audience, a very horrible Murder, and only puniſhing two of them; which proceeding gives an occaſion to the people to draw a dangerous inference from it, which may be Deſtructive to Government, and to Human Society.</p>
            <p>Thus, My Lord, I have a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect that the <hi>Oedipus</hi> derives its advantage from its Regularity, and its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and the preſumption grows ſtill more ſtrong, when upon enquiry I find, that the fore-mention'd Regularity is nothing but the bringing ſome Rules into practice, which Obſervation and Philoſophy have found requiſite for the ſurer exciting of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For as this, I think, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, that of two Combatants, who have equal Strength and equal Courage, he is moſt likely to have the better who has the moſt addreſs; ſo in a contention and prize of Poetry, between perſons who have equal force of mind, he will be certain to have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, who is the beſt inſtructed to uſe his ſtrength.</p>
            <p>If any of the enemies to Regularity will give themſelves the trouble to peruſe the <hi>Oedipus</hi> of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> with an impartial
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:13"/>
eye, he will eaſily diſcern how inſtrumental the Poetical Art is in leading him from Surprize to Surprize, from Compaſſion to Terror, and from Terror to Compaſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, without giving him ſo much as a time to breathe; and he will as eaſily diſcover, how the Religion that is every where inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd with the Play, ſhews all the Surprizes even when he leaſt expects this, as ſo many immediate ſucceſſive effects of a particular Dreadful Providence, which make them come like ſo many Thunder-claps from a ſerene Heaven to confound and aſtoniſh him.</p>
            <p>A Poet is capacitated by that which is commonly call'd Regularity, to excite the ordinary Paſſions more powerfully by the conſtitution of the Fable, and the influence which that muſt neceſſarily have both upon the words and thoughts; and Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides the Influence it will have upon the ordinary Paſſions, will be to a Poet, who has force and skill enough to make his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, a perpetual ſource of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſſion, which is commonly call'd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, for the ſentiments and the expreſſions.</p>
            <p>For what concerns Regularity, or the exciting of ordinary Paſſion, enough has been ſaid already. Your Lordſhip has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly made the Publick a Preſent, which is, I confeſs, but little in Volume but is mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:14"/>
in Value and Ornament; 'tis a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Jewels, which caſts a further luſtre than Treaſures that take up a larger ſpace, and is more ſolid to thoſe who are near it. Our Writers have been ſufficiently told, that writing Regularly is writing Morally, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, Juſtly, Naturally, Reaſonably. The Deſign, my Lord, of the following Treatiſe is to ſhew of what uſe Religion may be to the advancement of Poetry. But becauſe all that has been ſaid concerning Regularity is ſo neceſſary a preparative to this Deſign, that it would be wholly uſeleſs without it, I hope your Lordſhip will not think it to be foreign to my purpoſe, if at a time when the Rules are neglected by ſome, and ſlighted by others, I beſtow a little time in proving the neceſſity of obſerving thoſe; without the ſtrict obſervance of which, the following Treatiſe will be an empty amuſement, and we muſt abſolutely deſpair of making any advancement in Poetry.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of obſerving Rules to the attaining a perfection in Poetry is ſo very apparent, that he who will give himſelf the trouble of Reflecting, cannot eaſily doubt of it. Rules are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary even in all the inferiour Arts, as in Painting and Muſick. If any one ſhould pretend to draw a Picture without having ever been taught, or without knowing or
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:15"/>
practiſing any thing of Perſpective or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, but ſhould pretend to ſucceed alone by the natural force of his Fancy, that man would certainly be eſteem'd a very Impudent and Impertinent perſon.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip knows that it is the very ſame thing in Muſick that it is in Painting. If any one ſhould pretend to compoſe in parts, without underſtanding the grounds, that perſon would infallibly render himſelf very contemptible. Now if they pleaſe by Rules in a leſs noble Art, can they reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably expect to pleaſe without them in one that is more noble? If they pleaſe not by Rules in Poetry, how muſt they pleaſe? By Chance! For this is certain, that they muſt do it by one or the other, for there is no third way.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in Nature that is great and beautiful, without Rule and Order; and the more Rule and Order and Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we find in the objects that ſtrike our ſences, the more worthy and noble we eſteem them. I humbly conceive that it is the ſame in Art, and particularly in Poetry, which ought to be an exact imitation of Nature. Now Nature, taken in a ſtricter ſenſe, is nothing but that Rule and Order and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which we find in the viſible Creation. The Univerſe owes its admirable beauty to
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:16"/>
the Proportion, Situation and Dependance of its parts. And the little World, which we call Man, owes not only its Health and Eaſe and Pleaſure, nay, the continuance of its very Being to the Regularity of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical motion, but even the ſtrength too of its boaſted Reaſon, and the piercing force of thoſe aſpiring thoughts, which are able to paſs the bounds that circumſcribe the Univerſe. As Nature is Order and Rule and Harmony in the viſible World, ſo Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the very ſame throughout the inviſible Creation. For Reaſon is Order and the Reſult of Order. And nothing that is Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, as far as it is Irregular, ever was or ever can be either Natural or Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Whatever God Created he deſigned it Regular, and as the reſt of the Creatures cannot ſwerve in the leaſt from the Eternal Laws pre-ordain'd for them, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming fearful or odious to us; ſo Man, whoſe mind is a Law to itſelf, can never in the leaſt tranſgreſs that Law, without leſſning his Reaſon, and debaſing his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In fine, whatever is Irregular, either in the Viſible or Inviſible World, is to the perſon who thinks right, except in ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extraordinary caſes, either Hateful or Contemptible.</p>

               </gap> both Nature and Reaſon, which But a
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:17"/>
two in a larger acceptation is Nature, owe their Greatneſs, their Beauty, their Majeſty, to th eirperpetualOrder; for Order at firſt made the face ofthings ſo beautiful, and the ceſſation of that Order would once more bring in Chaos; ſo Poetry, which is an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Nature, muſt do the ſame thing. I can neither have Greatneſs or Real Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if it ſwerves from the Laws which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeverely preſcribes it, and the more Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular any Poetical Compoſition is, the nearer it comes to extravagance and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to nonſence, which is nothing.</p>
            <p>But, as in ſome of the numberleſs parts which conſtitute this beauteous all, there are ſome appearing irregularities, which parts notwithſtanding contribute with the reſt to compleat the Harmony of univerſal Nature; and as there are ſome ſeeming Irregularities even in the wonderful Diſpenſations of the Supream and Soveraign Reaſon, as the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the good, and flouriſhing of the bad, which yet at the bottom are rightly adjuſted, and wiſely compenſated, and are purpoſely appointed by Divine Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for the carrying on the profound De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Providence; ſo, if we may compare great things with ſmall, in the creation of the accompliſh'd Poem, ſome things may at firſt ſight be ſeemingly againſt Reaſon,
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:18"/>
which yet at the bottom are perfectly Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, becauſe they are indiſpenſably neceſſary to the admirable conduct of a great and a juſt Deſign.</p>
            <p>No man knows better than your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that the Renown'd Maſters among the Ancients, <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil, &amp;c.</hi> had too much Capacity, and too much Diſcernment, not to ſee the neceſſity of knowing and practiſing the Rules which Reaſon and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy have preſcib'd to Poets. They wrote not with a little narrow Deſign to pleaſe a Tumultuous tranſitory aſſembly, or a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of men who were call'd their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; They wrote to their fellow Citizens of the Univerſe, to all Countries and to all Ages; and they were perfectly convinc'd that tho Caprice and Extravagance may pleaſe the multitude, who are always fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, and always uncertain; yet that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is great in Reaſon and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, could be able to delight and inſtruct Mankind. They were clearly convinc'd that nothing could tranſmit their Immortal works to poſterity, but ſomething like that harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Order which maintains the Univerſe; that it was partly to that, they were to owe that wondrous merit, which could be able to render their Fame eternal, to extend and perpetuate the very languages in which they
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:19"/>
writ, and to illuſtrate the glory of their Countries by their own.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip knows that it was towards the beginning of the laſt Century, that the <hi>French,</hi> a ſubtle and diſcerning Nation, began to be ſenſible of this, and upon it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their extraordinary men, both Poets and Philoſophers, began to cultivate Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. Upon which there follow'd two very remarkable things. For firſt, the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating of the Poetical Art advanc'd their Genius's to ſuch a height, as was unknown to <hi>France</hi> before; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the appearing of thoſe great Genius's, was very inſtrumental in ſpreading their language thro all the Chriſtian World; and in raiſing the eſteem of their Nation to that degree, that it naturally prepar'd the way for their Intrigues of State, and facilitated the execution of their vaſt Deſigns.</p>
            <p>My Lord, theſe alterations happen'd in <hi>France,</hi> while the <hi>French</hi> reform'd the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of their Poems, by the noble models of ancient Architects; and your Lordſhip knows very well, that the very contrary fell out among us; while, notwithſtanding your generous attempt to reform us, we reſolv'd with an injudicious obſtinacy to adhere to our <hi>Gothick</hi> and Barbarous manner. For in the firſt place, our Stage has degenerated
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:20"/>
not only from the taſte of Nature, but from the greatneſs it had in the time of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear,</hi> in whoſe <hi>Coriolanus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> we ſee ſomething of the Invincible Spirit of the <hi>Romans</hi>; but in moſt of our Heroes which have lately appear'd on the Stage, Love has been ſtill the predominant paſſion, whether they have been <hi>Grecian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Heroes; which is falſe in Morality, and of ſcandalous inſtruction, and as falſe and abſurd in Phyſicks. For Ambition makes a man a Tyrant to himſelf, as well as it does to others; and where it once prevails, enſlaves the Reaſon, and ſubdues all other Paſſions. And it was for this very cauſe, if your Lordſhip will allow me to make this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, that in the two Tragedies that I writ my ſelf, I made Love a ſubordinate Paſſion, and ſubjected it in the one to Glory, and in the other to Friendſhip; that ſo I might make them fit to entertain the wiſeſt of our Sex, and the beſt and moſt virtuous of the other. And it is impoſſible to tell you with what extream ſatisfaction I heard that the laſt of them was not diſpleaſing to you.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, At the ſame time that the <hi>French</hi> has been growing almoſt an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Language, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> has been ſo far from diffuſing itſelf in ſo vaſt a manner, that I know by experience that a man may
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:21"/>
travel o're moſt of theſe Weſtern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> without meeting with three Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, who have any tolerable knowledge of it. And yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> is more ſtrong, more full, more ſounding, more ſignificant, and more harmonious than the <hi>French.</hi> I know very well, that a great many will be unwilling to allow the laſt; but I appeal to your Lordſhip if this is not a convincing proof of it, that we have Blank Verſe which is not inharmonious, and the <hi>French</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no Poetical Numbers, without the aſſiſtance of Rhime.</p>
            <p>But it may perhaps be alledg'd, that the reaſon why the <hi>French</hi> has got the advantage of our language, is partly from their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Continent, partly from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and affairs which they have with their Neighbours, and partly becauſe their Language has more affinity with one of the learned Languages. But to this I anſwer, that the <hi>Germans</hi> are as advantageouſly ſeated as the <hi>French</hi> for diffuſing their Language; and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nearer related to the <hi>Latin</hi> than is the <hi>French</hi>; and all the World knows, that towards the beginning of the laſt Century, the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was full as buſie with their Neighbours, as the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> is now; and yet then neither the <hi>German</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0391600400:22"/>
nor the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue made any conſide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable progreſs. I will not deny, but that the ſituation and affairs of the <hi>French</hi> may have been of advantage to them in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing their Language; but 'tis certainly the Learning of any Nation that is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in it. I make no doubt, but that in Learning, which is uſeful and neceſſary, and barely ſolid, without ornament, we far ſurpaſs the <hi>French.</hi> Our practical Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have more Reputation than theirs even in <hi>France</hi> itſelf; and our practical Divines have acquir'd more Fame, throughout the Northern Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> than either the natives of thoſe places, or any of the Modern <hi>French</hi> Divines, whether they are Reform'd or Papiſtical. And this laſt is therefore the more conſiderable, becauſe they writ in our mother Tongue, whereas the Phyſicians have employed a learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. But I am very much inclin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that 'tis the polite Learning of any Nation, that contributes moſt to the extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Language, and Poetry is the branch of polite Learning, which is the moſt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in it. In order to the proving this, I deſire your Lordſhips leave, to examine who they are who are moſt Inſtrumental in making a Language paſs the bounds which confine the original ſpeakers of it. And
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:23"/>
they ſeem to me to be the Gentlemen of neighbouring Nations, who have time and opportunity to viſit foreign Countries, and are capacitated by their Fortunes and their Educations, to cultivate Languages, which they were not born to ſpeak. For, beſides that theſe are the perſons who are the moſt capacitated to learn them, they have by the variety and multiplicity of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt opportunities to ſpread them. Now the motives that for the moſt part incite Gentlemen to ſtudy are two, Pleaſure and Vanity. But Pleaſure and Vanity will find their account abundantly more in polite Learning, than in Literature, which is bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolid. For, polite Learning is more eaſie, and has more of Imagination in it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs them much better how to varniſh their defects, and render them agreeable to one another. 'Tis chiefly then the polite Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Nation that engages the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of foreign Countries to apply themſelves to ſtudy the Language of that Nation. But even of polite Learning, Poetry appears to be the moſt agreeable, and moſt attractive branch, becauſe it is the moſt moving. And we find by experience, that in the Learning of thoſe Languages which have been moſt generally known, Poetry has made a very conſiderable figure. Gentlemen then in all
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:24"/>
likelihood will apply themſelves moſt eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſtudy of that Language, whoſe Poetry is very agreeable to them. But that Poetry muſt be moſt agreeable to the generality of Gentlemen which is moſt moving and moſt inſtructive. For, tho Gentlemen ſtudy to pleaſe themſelves, yet if they are men of ſenſe, they will not be for empty pleaſure, but will endeavour to be inſtructed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted together. Beſides, when Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men begin to ſtudy the Poetry of any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the firſt thing they underſtand is the reaſonable part of it. For the fineneſs of the Imaginative part, which depends in great meaſure upon force of words, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beauty of expreſſion, muſt lye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from them in a good degree till they are perfect in the Language. Thus the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of that Language which is moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt inſtructive, muſt in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood have moſt attraction for the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of neighbouring Nations; and we have ſhewn above, that that is the moſt reaſonable and moſt inſtructive Poetry, which is the moſt Regular.</p>
            <p>My Lord, upon this foot it is eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether our Poetry or the <hi>French</hi> has moſt attractions for the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> This is plain, that <hi>Moliere, Corneille</hi> and <hi>Racine</hi> and <hi>Boileau</hi> are known in a manner
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:25"/>
to all the Chriſtian World; whereas <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> and <hi>Milton, Ben Johnſon</hi> and <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi> are ſtrangers as it were to all the world, excepting the Subjects of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> I believe that our Language, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the dependance that it has upon the <hi>Saxon,</hi> is not very difficult to be learnt by the people of the Northern Countries; and in ſhort, many of their Clergy have learnt enough of it, to make their advantage of our Eccleſiaſtical Writings. But both they and their Gentlemen are almoſt wholly ſtrangers to our Poetry, whereas the <hi>French</hi> Poets are extremely well known to the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But here ſome angry people will immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask if I affirm that our own is inferiour to the <hi>French</hi> Poetry. To ſatisfie both them and the Truth, I am oblig'd to declare; at the ſame time ſubmitting this matter to be decided by your Lordſhip in the laſt appeal, that I believe we have naturally more force, and more elevation than the <hi>French</hi>; that ſeveral things in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> are ſuperiour to any which the <hi>French</hi> Theatre has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; and that in ſome little Poems, which either requir'd no ſymetry, or were writ by thoſe who very well knew how to practiſe it, we are abſolutely ſuperiour to them; that at laſt I am not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering my own thoughts, as the opinions
<pb facs="tcp:0391600400:26"/>
of others; that the very deſign I have even in affirming what I do, is to do what lies in my little capacity to put our Writers in a way to make our Neighbours, and with them all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſenſible of the advantage which we have by Nature? that even our natural force muſt receive acceſſion from Art, and augment in proportion as the <hi>French</hi> has done; that both our Force and our Spirit will in all likelihood be augmented by Skill, as addreſs in the uſe of our Weapons very often adds both to our Force and Courage. That a Poem with a Fable is like a Human Body, and that the weakneſs of any one part, influences and diſables in ſome degree thoſe which in themſelves are ſtrong; that if we are not ſhock'd at our own Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 'tis becauſe it has the advantage of long Habitude, for we have been us'd to it from our Infancy; but that to our Neighbours, who have conſtantly been us'd to Art and Conduct, it muſt ſeem as awkward and as diſagreeable, as our <hi>Gothick</hi> Cathedrals would to thoſe <hi>Italians</hi> who have always frequented St <hi>Peter</hi>'s; and that what I barely call Irregular here, would be term'd by them Indecent, Immoral, Unjuſt, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, Unnatural. In fine, I appeal to your Lordſhip, whether the <hi>French</hi> Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Writers are not believ'd ſuperiour to

The firſt part of the following Treatiſe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhew, that the Ancient Poets had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>at actual preheminence, but that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd it from joyning their Religion with their Poetry; upon which I believe they were thrown at firſt by chance. The Deſign of the ſecond part is to ſhew, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, by incorporating Poetry with the Religion reveal'd to us in Sacred Writ, may come to equal the Ancients. But two things muſt be always ſuppos'd: the one, That the Poets have force and skill equal to the ſubjects they treat of; and a ſacred ſubject requires ten times more of both than a prophane one. The other is, That this is not to be extended to thoſe ſorts of Poetry, in which the Moderns cannot poſſibly make uſe of their Religion, with the ſame advantage that the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> employ'd theirs, as Epic, Paſtoral and Amorous Poetry.</p>
            <p>My Lord, The ultimate end of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing diſcourſe is to ſhew that the intention of Poetry and the Chriſtian Religion being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>NOthing can ſhew the excellence of Poetry more, than that it has always been eſteem'd by the beſt of men, and that there has been no extraordinary man in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0391600400:32"/>
the world ſince it came to any perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but who has commended it or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd it.</p>
                  <p>And yet, to the Confuſion of moſt who have given themſelves time to think of it, Poetry, that has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by ſo many great Princes, is believ'd by ſeveral to have degenerated, rather than to have improv'd by Time; while Phyſicks, Metaphyſicks, and ſome other Arts, that have been very little, or not at all encourag'd, have advanc'd conſiderably.</p>
                  <p>And what will appear to be yet more ſtrange, the very efforts that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns have made to advance Poetry have done it hurt, becauſe they have proceeded upon ſuch erroneous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as have not only made their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts ſucceſsleſs, but have caus'd them to miſtake their Errors for their Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                  <p>For, ſome of the Moderns, who have been great Admirers of their Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, which is a modeſt expreſſion for themſelves, will by no means allow that the Ancients have excell'd us. From which opinion Preſumption has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, and from Preſumption Security, and from Security Idleneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0391600400:33"/>
But Deſpair on the other ſide has done a great deal more harm than Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption has done on that. For ſome who have been of opinion that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have ſurpaſs'd us, have believ'd that they have done ſo, becauſe they were in themſelves ſuperiour to us; from which it has happen'd that they have been ſervilely contented with following their old Maſters, and moſt of the Beſt of the Modern Poetry has been but a Copy of the Ancient.</p>
                  <p>Theſe different Opinions have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd Diſputes, and theſe Diſputes have produc'd Quarrels, which have been maintain'd with a great deal of Heat on both ſides. The favourers of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns have treated their Adverſaries as dejected little-ſoul'd perſons, who have a baſe opinion of themſelves and of Human Nature, which laſt they have much ado to forgive them, becauſe they are included in the Cenſure.</p>
                  <p>For, How can it be, ſay they, but a Scandalous Deſpondence that obliges us to prefer other men to our ſelves, when Reaſon gives us the preference. For this, they ſay, is paſt all Diſpute, that they who excel others in the ſame kinds
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0391600400:34"/>
of Writing, muſt have ſome advantage over them. And that advantage muſt be either from without or from within, or from the ſubjects they treat of. Now we can make it appear, ſay the Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Moderns, that the Ancient Poets had no external or internal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over us, and that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ſubject is rather on our ſide. And this is what the Favourers of the Moderns alledge for themſelves. The Partizans of the Ancients have on the other ſide treated the Favourers of the Moderns, as perſons that are abſolutely ignorant and without taſte.</p>
                  <p>That the Ancients have excelled us in the greatneſs of Poetry they pretend to prove from the Authority of all; who have univerſally been acknowledged to to be the beſt Judges. For, ſay they, the conſent of theſe, where the queſtion is concerning a thing, that is rather to be felt, than to be demonſtrated, is of the laſt importance. We defy, ſay they, any of the Favourers of the Moderns, to name ſo much as one Modern Critick, who has any Reputation in the world, who does not acknowledge that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ſurpaſs us in the greatneſs of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0391600400:35"/>
For the few, ſay they, who have aſſerted the preheminence of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, have immediately rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ridiculous to all men, who have any underſtanding in theſe affairs, and at length to all the reſt, excepting a little handful of men, whoſe arrogance and obſtinacy and extravagant vanity has been a Comedy to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>So that the conſent of the beſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, continue they, implies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all, and the conſent of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind for ſo many ſeveral ages, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a thing that is rather to be felt, than to be demonſtrated, is, if not a convincing Proof, at leaſt a very ſtrong Preſumption. But what has been the event of this Diſpute on both ſides? Why the probability of the Arguments, inſtead of working conviction, has only exaſperated the Spirits of the Parties; and the Favourers of the Moderns have treated the Lovers of the Ancients as ſo many ſlaviſh Pedants, and theſe on the other ſide the Favourers of the Moderns as ſo many ignorant Fools.</p>
                  <p>Amidſt this diverſity of opinions and theſe contentious ferments, I thought I ſhould do an important ſervice to a moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0391600400:36"/>
noble art, if I could contribute any thing to the reconciling the common Friends to Poetry, that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the advancement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe with greater force united.</p>
                  <p>In order then to the calming the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Contending Parties, I ſhall endeavour to extort Important Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from both, and oblige on the one ſide, the Favourers of the Moderns, to acknowledge that the Ancients are not ſo weak as to make the Moderns pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; and engage at the ſame time the Partiſans of the Ancients to own, that the Ancients are not in themſelves ſo ſtrong, as to make the Moderns de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
                  <p>And in order to the gaining this point with the greater eaſe, and the making my ſelf an Agreeable Mediator of Peace, I ſhall endeavour to make an Impartial enquiry into the merits of the Cauſe, and try to engage both Parties by turns, by ſupporting their juſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And whereas the Favourers of the Moderns have juſtly alledged, that all Writers who ſurpaſs others in the ſame kinds of Writings, muſt do it from ſome nternal, or external advantage, or from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0391600400:37"/>
the ſubject it ſelf, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew in the two following Chapters, that the Ancients could not derive their preheminence from any external or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal advantage, and afterwards we ſhall proceed to examine whether they deriv'd it from the ſubjects they treated of.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. II. That the Ancients did not excel the Moderns by any External Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</head>
                  <p>THe External Advantages which one Writer has over another are chiefly two. The Aſſiſtance which he receives from the Age in which he writes, and the Encouragement he meets with. Now we ſhall ſhew that the Ancients did not ſurpaſs the Moderns on the account of either of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they had no advantage in the Aſſiſtance which they receiv'd from the Age in which they writ; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0391600400:38"/>
the advantage here is clearly on the ſide of the Moderns: For good Thinking is the foundation of good Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, both in Eloquence and in Poetry. Now thoughts are but the Images of things, and our knowledge of things is greater than that of the Ancients. For ſeveral which they knew are better known to us, and we know ſeveral which they never knew at all. How many Arts have the Moderns im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd? How many wonderful Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are owing to them? And how many amazing Diſcoveries? From which we have a ſupply of Thoughts and Images that is never to be exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that in the Aſſiſtance which we Receive from the Age in which we live, we have the advantage of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</p>
                  <p>Nor, ſecondly, is it from the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement which they received, that the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns: Tho at the ſame time I really believe that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement was one of the cauſes of the Ancient excellence of the Orators. For tho good Thinking is the foundation of good Writing both in Eloquence and in Poetry, and the Moderns are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0391600400:39"/>
to think as Reaſonably and as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly as the Ancients thought, yet 'tis in theſe Arts as it is in Architecture, there can be no Beauty nor Greatneſs without Foundation, but 'tis not the Foundation that makes the Greatneſs or Beauty. The chief deſign of Eloquence is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and he perſwading the moſt effectually who moves his Hearers the moſt; that which makes the Greatneſs and Beauty of Eloquence, is not ſo much the thinking rightly, tho without that there can be no Excellence, as thoſe violent Paſſions that reign and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over our Souls in the Speeches of the Ancient Orators, which they chiefly deriv'd from Ambition. For the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Popular Aſſemblies among the Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> being almoſt the only way among them to arrive at the chief Honours of the State, it can be no wonder to thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Force of Ambition, and the Stings it infixes into the minds of men, that the Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould be ſo great Maſters of Eloquence. For, being inſtigated and ſtung by Ambition, they not only were ſupported in the taking ſuch pains as the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0391600400:40"/>
Moderns are utterly uncapable of taking, becauſe they have not the ſame incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſuſtain them, but being mov'd and fir'd by Ambition themſelves they the more eaſily rowz'd and inflam'd others; for if any one happens to urge, that the Love of Glory being alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from Moderns and Ancients, they have equal incentives to Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; I deſire him to take notice, that there is a very conſiderable difference between the Love of Glory barely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and that which is joyn'd to Ambition, which is the deſire of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Place. For I deſire him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what Nouriſhment and Force the Love of Glory that was in the minds of the Ancient Orators, muſt neceſſarily have received from the Tumultuous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of the popular Aſſemblies, and the Glorious Recompences that enſued upon them.</p>
                  <p>But now if any one thinks, that he has here found out the Reaſon, why the Ancients ſurpaſs'd us in the greater Poetry, becauſe Paſſion making the Greatneſs and Beauty of Poetry, as well as it does of Eloquence, (which it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly does, as ſhall be clearly ſhewn
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0391600400:41"/>
anon) and Paſſion receiving acceſs from Encouragement, the Ancient Poets writ with a Force ſuperiour to that of the Moderns, only becauſe they were more encouraged: if any one, I ſay, thinks at this rate, he will find himſelf very much miſtaken. For tho I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that Encouragement does very much, yet I am ſatisfied that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not chiefly owing to that; for in the firſt place, tho the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Ancients gave, was more general than that which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns have met with, yet ſome of the Moderns have been as much encourag'd as moſt of the Ancients were, and yet fall very much ſhort of them in the greater Poetry, of which <hi>Boileau</hi> and <hi>Racine</hi> are two Illuſtrious Examples. In the ſecond place, <hi>Homer,</hi> the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable of all the Ancients, was not at all encourag'd. In the third place, one of the Moderns receiv'd no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who has often tranſcendently ſoar'd above both Ancients and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, and that is <hi>Milton,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewn in its proper place. And, laſtly, Comedy was as much encourag'd by the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> as any other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0391600400:42"/>
ſort of Poetry; witneſs what the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> did for <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius</hi> for <hi>Terence</hi>; and yet I am perſwaded that the Moderns have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd the Ancients in Comedy, and ſhall give my Reaſons below why I make no ſcruple of preferring <hi>Moliere,</hi> and two or three of our own Comick Poets, to <hi>Terence</hi> and <hi>Ariſtophanes.</hi> So that we muſt ſeek for another Cauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the Ancient Poets, than the encouragement they met with.</p>
                  <p>There are three other things which may be numbred among external advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and thoſe are the Climates in which the Ancient Poets liv'd, and the Languages in which they writ, and the Liberty which they enjoy'd. But theſe are not the chief things from which the Ancients deriv'd their Preheminence. For the greateſt of the <hi>Lyrick</hi> Poets writ in a Country of downright Blockheads, and one of the greateſt of the <hi>Epick</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets in a Country that had loſt its Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and beſides the <hi>Grecians</hi> enjoy'd all the advantages of their Climate, and their Language and their Liberty, long after the Decay of Poetry. 'Tis true, indeed, the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> did
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0391600400:43"/>
derive one real Excellence from the Beauty of their Language, and that was the Harmony of their Verſification, in which the Moderns are not likely to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual them. But Harmony of Verſificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not the chief thing in Poetry, nor does the chief Excellence of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents conſiſt in ſuch a Harmony. And thus we have ſhewn that they did not derive their Preheminence from any thing that was external: Let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the next Chapter, whether the Ancients deriv'd their Excellence from any internal advantage.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. III. That the Ancients did not ſurpaſs the Moderns from any Internal Advantage.</head>
                  <p>THere is nothing more certain, than that he who handles any ſubject excellently, muſt do it by the power of his Internal Faculties. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he who treats any ſubject admirably,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0391600400:44"/>
has an inward advantage over him who treats it ſcurvily. But either that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is naturally deriv'd from the ſubject, or it is not. If it is naturally deriv'd from the ſubject, in that caſe we can never pretend to deny that the Ancients had an inward advantage over the Moderns. All that we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove, is, that they had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal advantage over them, abſtracted from the nature of the ſubjects of which they treated.</p>
                  <p>Now all the internal advantages, which the Ancients may be ſuppoſed to have had over the Moderns, may be reduc'd to four. Divine Inſpiration. Inſpiration by Daemons. A Natural Superiority of the Faculties of the Soul. A greater Degree of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>The firſt advantage that the Ancient Poets may be ſuppoſ'd to have had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Moderns, is from Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now the Ancient Poets were the Heathen Theologues, and to affirm that the Spirit of God ſhould inſpire thoſe to teach the Adoration of Idols, and inſpire them more than he does the Moderns, who are of the true Religion, would be equally abſurd and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0391600400:45"/>
Nor, Secondly, can they have any advantage by Inſpiration of Daemons. For in the firſt place, 'tis abſurd to give a ſupernatural Cauſe of an effect of which we can give a very natural one. But we can give a very natural Cauſe of the Excellence of the Ancient Poets, as ſhall be ſhewn anon. In the ſecond place the Ancients before <hi>Socrates,</hi> ow'd all their Moral Philoſophy to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. Now tho that Philoſophy was only diſpers'd up and down in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, yet had it a natural tendency to the forming that ſyſtem, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Diſciples of <hi>Socrates</hi> fram'd from the mouth of their Maſter. And as that ſyſtem was the utter overthrow of the Heathen Revelation, as we ſhall ſhew anon, any thing that had a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to the forming that ſyſtem, could not be the work of Daemons. But Thirdly, ſuppoſing the Ancient <hi>Graecian</hi> Poets were really inſpired by Daemons, it is hard to imagine that they ſhould receive a greater advantage from ſuch an Inſpiration as that, than the Moderns, who apply themſelves to Sacred Poetry, ſhould have from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0391600400:46"/>
Nor, Thirdly, Can the Ancient Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ets be ſuppos'd to have had a greater ſhare of virtue than the Moderns. For all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets who were famous for the greater Poetry, flouriſh'd before there was in that part of the world any ſyſtem of Morality. And perhaps moſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poetry is only a Copy of the <hi>Grecian.</hi> Now it is hard to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that they who had no ſyſtem of Morality, and no ſupernatural ſupport, ſhould tranſcend the Moderns in Vertue, who have a perfect ſyſtem of Morality and Divine Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Nor, Fourthly, and principally, had the Ancient any natural ſuperiority of Faculties over the Modern Poets. For if they ſurpaſs the Moderns in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Poetry, out of any ſuperiority of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which they had naturally as they were the Ancients, it muſt be by a ſuperiority of underſtanding or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or both. But firſt, it was not from any ſuperiority of underſtanding. Becauſe from hence it would follow, that the Minds of men grow weaker by ſucceſſion of ages, and then the Ancients would have ſurpaſs'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they preceded in time.<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0391600400:47"/>
                     <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Muſaeus</hi> would have excell'd <hi>Homer, Alcaeus</hi> and <hi>Stetichorus Pindar, Theſpis Euripides,</hi> and <hi>Aeſchylus Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>; <hi>Tyrtaeus Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Alcmon Horace,</hi> which is all abſolutely falſe. But then again, if any one urges, that if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did not ſurpaſs one another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to precedence of time, it was becauſe art and experience were requir'd to the perfection of Poetry, and the younger in Time had the Advantage of the elder both in Art and Experience; to that I anſwer, that ſome of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, who are younger in Time, have perhaps the advantage of thoſe who are older, more by Nature than they have by Art. For the Tragick and Lyrick Poets, who preceded <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> come more behind them in true Genius than they go before them in Time. But now if the Ancients did not ſurpaſs one another according to priority of Time, why ſhould they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel us? If it be objected, that ſeveral very extraordinary men happen'd to be born at ſuch and ſuch particular times; to that I anſwer, that this arriv'd by providence or by chance. If you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it fell out by chance, to that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0391600400:48"/>
I reply, that all the great Poets among the <hi>Grecians</hi> flouriſh'd within four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years of one another, and all the great Poets among the <hi>Romans</hi> within two hundred years; and then let me ask you, whither this look'd like chance. But if you pretend, that theſe men at theſe particular times, were deſign'd ſuch excellent Poets by Providence, and for that very end were form'd with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſo much ſuperiour to thoſe who preceded them, and who came after them; then let me ask you, for what deſign Providence ſhould ſo manifeſtly alter the courſe of nature, or why that which fell out by Providence then, may not by Providence arrive again.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns by a ſuperiority of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it would neceſſarily follow that they underſtood their Subjects bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which is falſe: For the Subjects of the Epick, Tragick and Lyrick Poets, are the vertues, vices, and paſſions of men, which the Moderns ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand at leaſt as well as the Ancients, becauſe they have all the knowledge of the Ancients, and their own improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beſides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0391600400:49"/>
Thus have I endeavour'd to ſhow, that we have no reaſon to deſpair of equalling the Ancients, becauſe of the Tranſcendency of their underſtandings. And what has been ſaid about their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, may ſerve to ſhew that they as little excell'd the Moderns in their Imaginations, as they did in the other; tho ſomething more may be ſaid for the laſt, for the violence of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, proceeding from the force of the Imagination, and the corruption of Mankind, from the violence of the Paſſions, and the corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind growing greater, as the World grows older; it follows, that the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of Men muſt grow ſtronger as the World grows older.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, how vain it is to urge, that the Ancients excell'd the Moderns by a ſuperiority of Faculties, when it will appear a little lower, as clear as the Sun, that one of the Moderns very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten excells them both in his Thoughts and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have endeavour'd to ſhew, that the Ancients did not excell the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns in the greater Poetry, from any external advantage, that is, from the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0391600400:50"/>
aſſiſtance which they had, from the Ages in which they writ, or from the Encouragement with which they met. We have ſhewn too, that they did not ſurpaſs them from any Internal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, whether it was from Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, or Inſpiration by Daemons, or Tranſcendency of Vertue, or ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of Faculties. The advantage then, which the Ancient Poets had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Moderns, if they had any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, muſt be deriv'd from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of which they treated.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. That the Ancient Poets deriv'd their greatneſs from the Nature of their Subjects.</head>
                  <p>IF the Ancient Poets excell'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns in the greatneſs of Poetry; that is, in Epick Poetry, in Tragedy, and in the greater Ode; they muſt neceſſarily derive their preheminence from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of which they treated, ſince it has
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0391600400:51"/>
beeu plainly made to appear, that they could notDerive it from anyExternal or Internal advantage. And it follows, that the Subjects which were handled by the Ancients, muſt be different from thoſe which have been treated of by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns. And if the Poems which have been writ by the Ancients of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned kinds were very much greater than thoſe which have been produced by the Moderns, why then it follows, that the ſubjects were very different. But here the Favourers of the Moderns aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that the advantage which is to be drawn from the Subject, is purely on the ſide of the Moderns. For who, for Example, will compare the atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the event of which was only the reducing two pitiful paltry Bourgs, with the glorious actions of ſome of our Modern Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. But then the Partizans of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients reply, that there is a difference between one ſubject and another, which their adverſaries ſeem not to have thought of. For, ſay they, humane Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, can never differ ſo much among themſelves, as Sacred Subjects differ from Humane, for the difference
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0391600400:52"/>
between the Two laſt is as great as that between God and Man; which we know is infinite. Now, ſay they, ſacred Subjects are infinitely more ſuſceptible of the greatneſs of Poetry, than prophane ones can be. And the Subjects of the Ancients in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Poems were ſacred. Now that we may engage the Lovers of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in their turns by ſupporting their juſt pretenſions, let us endeavour to ſhow in the following Chapters, that Sacred Poems muſt be greater than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ones can be, ſuppoſing equality of Genius, and equal art in the Writers, and that the Poems of the Ancients in the forementioned kinds were ſacred. But in order to the doing that, we muſt declare what Poety is, and what is its chief Excellence.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. The Paſſion is the chief thing in in Poetry, and that all Paſſion is either ordinary Paſſion, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.</head>
                  <p>But before we proceed let us define Poetry; which is the firſt time that a Definition has been given of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Art: For neither Ancient nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Criticks have defin'd Poetry in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>Poetry then is an imitation of Nature by a pathetick and numerous Speech. Let us explain it.</p>
                  <p>As Poetry is an Art, it muſt be an Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Nature. That the inſtrument with which it makes its Imitation is Speech need not be diſputed. That that Speech, muſt be Muſical, no one can doubt: For Numbers diſtinguiſh the parts of Poetick Diction from the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of Proſe. Now Numbers are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but articulate ſounds, and their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0391600400:54"/>
pauſes meaſur'd by their proper propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of time. And the periods of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick Diction are articulate ſounds, and their pauſes unmeaſur'd by ſuch propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That the Speech, by which Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try makes its Imitation, muſt be pathetick is evident; for Paſſion is ſtill more neceſſary to it than Harmony. For Harmony only diſtinguiſhes its Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that of Proſe, but Paſſion diſtinguiſhes its very nature and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. For therefore Poetry is Poetry, becauſe it is more paſſionate and ſenſual than Proſe. A Diſcourſe that is writ in very good Numbers, if it wants Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can be but meaſur'd Proſe. But a Diſcourſe that is every where extremely pathetick, and conſequently every where bold and figurative, is certainly Poetry without Numbers.</p>
                  <p>Paſſion then is the Characteriſtical mark of Poetry, and conſequently muſt be every where. For where-ever a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is not pathetick, there it is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick. As Paſſion in a Poem muſt be every where, ſo Harmony is uſually dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd throughout it. But Paſſion anſwers the two ends of Poetry better than Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony can do, and upon that account is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0391600400:55"/>
preferable to it: For firſt it pleaſes more, which is evident: For Paſſion can pleaſe without Harmony, but Harmony tires without Paſſion. And in Tragedy and in Epick Poetry a man may inſtruct without Harmony, but never without Paſſion: For the one inſtructs by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and the other by Compaſſion and Terror. And as for the greater Ode, if it wants Paſſion, it becomes Hateful and Intolerable, and its Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences grow Contemptible.</p>
                  <p>Paſſion is the Characteriſtical mark of Poetry, and therefore it muſt be every where; for without Paſſion there can be no Poetry, no more than there can be Painting. And tho the Poet and the Painter deſcribe action, they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it with Paſſion. Let any one who beholds a piece of Painting, where the Figures are ſhewn in action, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that if the Figures are without Paſſion the Painting is contemptible. There muſt be Paſſion every where in Poetry and Painting, and the more Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there is, the better the Poetry and the Painting, unleſs the Paſſion is too much for the ſubject; and the Painter and the Poet arrive at the height of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0391600400:56"/>
their Art, when they deſcribe a great deal of Action with a great deal of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It is plain then from what has been ſaid, that Paſſion in Poetry muſt be every where, for where there is no Paſſion there can be no Poetry, but that which we commonly call Paſſion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be every where in any Poem. There muſt be Paſſion then, that muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from ordinary Paſſion, and that muſt be Enthuſiaſm. I call that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Paſſion, whoſe cauſe is clearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by him who feels it, whether it be Admiration, Terror or Joy; and I call the very ſame Paſſions Enthuſiaſms, when their cauſe is not clearly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by him who feels them. And thoſe Enthuſiaſtick Paſſions are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſimple, and ſometimes complicated, of all which we ſhall ſhew examples lower. And thus I have ſhewn that the chief thing in Poetry is Paſſion; but here the Reader is deſir'd to obſerve, that by Poetry we mean Poetry in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the Body of Poetry; for as for the form or ſoul of particular Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, that is allow'd by all to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But Paſſion is the chief thing in the Body of Poetry, as Spirit is in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0391600400:57"/>
Human Body. For without Spirit the Body languiſhes, and the Soul is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Now every thing that they call Spirit or Genius in Poetry, in ſhort, every thing that pleaſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently moves in the Poetick Diction, is Paſſion, whether it be ordinary or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſhewn what the chief excellence in the Body of Poetry is, which we have prov'd to be Paſſion. Let us now proceed to the proofs of what we propounded, that ſacred ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are more ſuſceptible of Paſſion than prophane ones, and that the ſubjects of the Ancients were ſacred in their greater Poetry, I mean either ſacred in their own natures, or by their manner of handling them.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. That Paſſion is more to be deriv'd from a Sacred Subject than from a Prophane one.</head>
                  <p>WE have prov'd that Paſſion is the chief thing in Poetry, and that Spirit or Genius, and in ſhort every thing that moves is Paſſion. Now if the chief thing in Poetry be Paſſion, why then the chief thing in great Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try muſt be great Paſſion. We have ſhewn too, that Paſſion in Poetry is of two ſorts, ordinary Paſſion or Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm. Let us now proceed to convince the Reader, that a ſacred Poem is more ſuſceptible of Paſſion than a prophane one can be; which to effect, let us ſhew two things, that a ſacred ſubject is as ſuſceptible of ordinary paſſions as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane one can be, and more ſuſceptible of the Enthuſiaſtick.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is evident from experience: For the Poetry among the Ancients,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0391600400:59"/>
which ſhall be hereafter prov'd to be ſacred, had in it greater ordinary Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than their Human Poetry either had or could poſſibly have.</p>
                  <p>'Tis now our buſineſs to ſhow that Religious ſubjects are capable of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with more frequent and ſtronger Enthuſiaſms than the prophane. And in order to the clearing this, let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what Poetical Enthuſiaſm is. Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Enthuſiaſm is a Paſſion guided by Judgment, whoſe cauſe is not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by us. That it is a Paſſion is plain, becauſe it moves. That the cauſe is not comprehended is ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident. That it ought to guided by Judgment is indubitable. For otherwiſe it would be Madneſs, and not Poetical Paſſion. But now let us enquire what the cauſe of Poetical Enthuſiaſm is, that has been hitherto not comprehended by us. That Enthuſiaſm moves, is plain to ſence; why then it mov'd the Writer: But if it mov'd the Writer, it mov'd him while he was thinking. Now what can move a man while he is thinking, but the thoughts that are in his mind. In ſhort, Enthuſiaſm as well as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſſions, muſt proceed from the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0391600400:60"/>
thoughts, as the Paſſions of all reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures muſt certainly do; but the reaſon why we know not the cauſes of Enthuſiaſtick as well as of ordinary Paſſions, is becauſe we are not ſo us'd to them, and becauſe they proceed from thoughts, that latently and unobſerv'd by us, carry Paſſion along with them. Here it would be no hard matter to prove that moſt of our thoughts are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally attended with ſome ſort and ſome degree of Paſſion. And 'tis the expreſſion of this Paſſion, which gives us ſo much pleaſure, both in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and in Human Authors. For I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any man who is not altogether a Philoſopher, whether he is not moſt pleas'd with. Converſation and Books that are Spirited. Now how can this Spirit pleaſe him, but becauſe it moves him, or what can move him but Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? We never ſpeak for ſo much as a minute together withont different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions of voice. Now any one will find upon reflection, that theſe variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thoſe inflexions mark our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent paſſions. But all this paſſes unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by us, by reaſon of long uſe, and the incredible celerity of our thoughts,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0391600400:61"/>
whoſe motion is ſo ſwift, that it is even to our ſelves imperceptible; unleſs we come to reflect, and every one will not be at the trouble of that. Now theſe paſſions, when they grow ſtrong I call Enthuſiaſtick motions, and the ſtronger they are the greater the Enthuſiaſm muſt be. If any one asks what ſort of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons theſe are, that thus unknown to us flow from theſe thoughts; to him I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the ſame ſort of paſſions flow from the thoughts, that would do from the things of which thoſe thoughts are Ideas. As for example, if the thing that we think of is great, when then admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attends the Idea of it; and if it is very great amazement. If the thing is pleaſing and delightful, why then Joy and Gayety flow from the Idea of it; if it is ſad, melancholy; if 'tis miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and powerful, then the Imagination of it is attended with Terror; And if 'tis both great and likely to do hurt and powerful, why then the thought of it is at once accompanied with Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Terror and Aſtoniſhment. Add to all this, that the mind producing theſe thoughts, conceives by reflection a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pride, and Joy and Admiration, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0391600400:62"/>
at the conſcious view of its own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Now he who ſtrictly examines the Enthuſiaſm that is to be met with in the greater Poetry, will find that it is nothing but the fore-mention'd paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either ſimple or complicated, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the thoughts from which they naturally flow, as being the thoughts or Images of things that carry thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions along with them, as we ſhall ſhew by examples in the following Chapter.</p>
                  <p>But theſe paſſions that attend upon our thoughts are ſeldom ſo ſtrong, as they are in thoſe kind of thoughts which we call Images. For they being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lively pictures of the things which they repreſent, ſet them, as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our very eyes. But Images are ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver ſo admirably drawn, as when they are drawn in motion; eſpecially if the motion is violent. For the mind can never imagine violent motion, without being in a violent agitation it ſelf; and the Imagination being fir'd with that Agitation, ſets the very things before our eyes; and conſequently makes us have the ſame paſſions that we ſhould have from the things themſelves. For the warmer the Imagination is, the more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0391600400:63"/>
preſent the things are to us, of which we draw the Images, and therefore when once the Imagination is ſo inflam'd as to get the better of the underſtanding, there is no difference between the Images and the things themſelves; as we ſee, for example, in Fevers and Mad men.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we ſhewn that Enthuſiaſm flows from the thoughts, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from the ſubject from which the thoughts proceed. For, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Poetry is to be proportion'd to the Thought, for otherwiſe it does not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flow from it, and conſequently is not guided by Judgment; ſo the Thought is to be proportion'd to the Subject. Now no Subject is ſo capable of ſupplying us with thoughts, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily produce theſe great and ſtrong Enthuſiaſms, as a Religious Subject: For all which is great in Religion is moſt exalted and amazing, all that is joyful is tranſporting, all that is ſad is diſmal, and all that is terrible is aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. The Cauſes of Poetical Enthuſiaſm, ſhewn by Examples.</head>
                  <p>THe Enthuſiaſm that is found in Poetry, is nothing but the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned paſſions, Admiration, Joy, Terror, Aſtoniſhment, flowing from the thoughts which naturally produce them. For Admiration, together with that Pride which exalts the ſoul at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a great Hint, gives elevation; Joy, if 'tis great, gives tranſport, and aſtoniſhment gives vehemence. But now let us ſhew by examples, how this was done, and let us begin with that Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ode of <hi>Horace,</hi> which is the third of the Third Book.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Juſtum &amp; Tenacem propoſiti virum,</l>

                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0391600400:65"/>
Nec fulmin antis magna Jovis manus,</l>
                     <l>Se fractus Illabatur Orbis</l>
                     <l>Impavidum ferient Ruinae. </l>
                  </q>
                  <p>That is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The man, the brave man, who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd upon a right and a firm principle, is ſure never to have his ſolid vertue ſhaken, neither by the rage of the giddy multitude, nor by the frowns of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Tyrant, nor by the Fury of the Roaring South, that Turbulent Ruler of the Tempeſtuous</hi> Adria; <hi>no, nor by the Red Right Hand of Thundring</hi> Jove: <hi>Nay, ſhould the World's disjointed Frame come ruſhing down with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Sound upon him, its Ruines might Cruſh, but they could never Shake him.</hi> Now 'tis plain that in the original there is a great deal of Enthuſiaſm. But let us obſerve a little what this Enthuſiaſm is. Upon obſervation we ſhall find then, that in the fore-mentioned Verſes there is Elevation, Severity and Vehemence, and conſequently there is ſomething Admirable in them, and Terrible and Aſtoniſhing. Now why ſhould we feel theſe paſſions in reading theſe thoughts, unleſs the paſſions naturally attend them, when they are expreſs'd as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0391600400:66"/>
they ſhould be? But Admiration, as we have ſaid above, muſt come from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is great, and Terror from ſomething that is powerful, and likely to hurt; and Aſtoniſhment from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is very Terrible, and very likely to hurt; that is, from things that are ſo, or from their Idea's. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, upon examining the fore-mention'd Verſes, will find that the thoughts in them all are great and terrible, and ſome of them are aſtoniſhing.</p>
                  <p>But here I deſire the Reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve three things: Firſt, the admirable gradation of Thought here. How the Poet riſes from ſomething that is Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ſomething that is more Terrible, till he comes at laſt to ſomething Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and Amazing. How from the Rage of the Mad Multitude, he proceeds to the frowns of a Tyrant that ſtands threatning by: How he riſes from thence to a ſtorm at Sea, and from thence to the wrath of <hi>Jove</hi> expreſs'd in the dreadful Thunder, and from thence to the final diſmal Diſſolution of all things. The next thing that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to obſerve is, How the Spirit of the Poet riſes with his Thoughts, which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0391600400:67"/>
is a ſure ſign, that the one is nothing but the paſſions that attend on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the third thing that the Reader is to remark is, that the Poet could not carry his Enthuſiaſm higher after the ſecond thought, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recourſe to Religion. For he who knows any thing of the Pagan ſyſtem, knows that the three laſt thoughts are taken from their Religion.</p>

I deſire the Reader would give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the trouble of comparing theſe ten lines, with the ten that preceded them, and then to tell me, why the Spirit ſhould be ſo much greater in theſe than it is in the others; unleſs it proceeded from the greatneſs of the Ideas, or how the greatneſs of the Ideas could cauſe it, but by infuſing into the Poet admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and a noble pride, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd make the Spirit, which is ſtately and majeſtick till the laſt, and then it grows vehement, becauſe the Idea which cauſes it, is not only great, but very Terrible. For all the afflicting Paſſions that are violent are expreſs'd with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence.

                  <p>The firſt, beſides its Greatneſs, carries Terror along with it. <hi>Virgil</hi> compares the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> which had been ten years beſieg'd, to the fall of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Aſh, at whoſe Root the labouring Swains had been a long time hewing with their Axes.</p>

                  <p>Let us conſider beſide what prodigious force all this muſt have in the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where Religion adds to the Terror, encreaſes the Aſtoniſhment, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Horror. For 'twas by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Minerva</hi> that this Terrible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident was brought about, who had combin'd with <hi>Juno</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi> as has been at large declar'd in a former Critical Treatiſe. And thus we have endeavour'd to ſhew how the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm proceeds from the thoughts, and conſequently from the ſubject. But one thing we have omitted, that as thoughts produce the ſpirit, the ſpirit produces and makes the expreſſion; which is known by experience to all
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0391600400:76"/>
who are Poets; for never any one, while he was wrapt with Enthuſiaſm, wanted either Words or Harmony; and is ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident to all who conſider, that the Expreſſion conveys and ſhows the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and therefore muſt be produced by it. So that from what we have ſaid we may venture to lay down this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Poetical Genius. Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Genius in a Poem is the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Ordinary or Enthuſiaſtick Paſſion, proceeding from Ideas, to which it naturally belongs; and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Genius in a Poet, is the power of expreſſing ſuch Paſſion worthily: And the ſublime is a great thought expreſt with the Enthuſiaſm that belongs to it, which the Reader will find Agreeable to the Doctrine of <hi>Cecilius. Longinus,</hi> I muſt confeſs, has not told us what the ſublime is; becauſe <hi>Cecilius,</hi> it ſeems, had done that before him. Tho me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, it was a very great fault in ſo great a Man as <hi>Longinus,</hi> to write a Book which could not be underſtood, but by another Mans Writings; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he ſaw that thoſe Writings were ſo very defective, that they were not likely to laſt. But tho <hi>Longinus</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0391600400:77"/>
does not directly tell us, what the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime is, yet in the firſt ſix or ſeven Chapters of his Book, he takes a great deal of pains to ſet before us, the effects which it produces in the minds of Men; as, for example, that it cauſes in them admiration and ſurprize; a noble Pride, and a noble Vigour, an invincible force tranſporting the Soul from its ordinary Situation, and a Tranſport, and a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy mingled with Aſtoniſhment. Theſe are the effects that <hi>Longinus</hi> tells us that the Sublime produces in the minds of men. Now I have endeavour'd to ſhew what it is in Poetry that works theſe effects. So that take the Cauſe and the Effects together, and you have the Sublime.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. Recapitulation, and that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Ancients, in their greater Poetry, were Sacred.</head>
                  <p>WE have now ſhewn, that if the Ancients excel the Moderns in Epick Poetry, in Tragedy, and in the greater Ode, they derive not their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence from any external, nor from any internal advantage, abſtracted from the nature of the ſubject, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they muſt draw it from the nature of the ſubject itſelf. Then we ſhew'd that the greateſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one ſubject and another is that of Sacred and Prophane. Then we ſhew'd that Paſſion was the chief thing in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and great Paſſion in great Poetry, and that either ordinary Paſſion or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm. Then we ſhew'd that Sacred ſubjects were as ſuſceptible of ordinary Paſſion, as the Prophane and more ſuſceptible of the Enthuſiaſtick, which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0391600400:79"/>
laſt we ſhew'd by Reaſon and by Example. So that to give a convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſon why the Ancients did, and muſt for the moſt part excel the Moderns in Epick Poetry in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, and the greater Ode, we have nothing to do, but to ſhew, that thoſe Poems among the Ancients were always Sacred, becauſe it is very well known, that among the Moderns, they are for the moſt part Prophane. Firſt, then for Tragedy, that is very well known to have been Sacred in its inſtitution, and it is full as plain, that it muſt have been Sacred in its original Nature, and after that the Epiſodes began to Intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chorus, it ſtill continued Sacred, as having Apoſtrophes, Revelations, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, Machines. And ſo had the greater Ode. And as for Epick Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in that the eldeſt of the Muſes after the firſt Invocation was believed to Dictate every thing; beſides, that the Gods were every where introduced in it, and all things were done by their Miniſtery.

                  <p>THat the Ancients in the <hi>Epos,</hi> in the Ode, and in Tragedy, deriv'd their preheminence from Religion, may appear from ſeveral things that have not yet been mention'd, and firſt of all from this, that they did not excel the Moderns in Poetry, in which they drew no advantage from Religion, as in Comedy and in Satyr, and that in Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Poetry, as the <hi>Pharſalia</hi> of <hi>Lucan,</hi> whenever the Ancients excell'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, they drew their advantage from Religion.</p>

For Comedy the Ancients are ſo far from excelling the Moderns in it, that the advantage is clearly on our ſide. For I ſhall make no ſcruple of preferring <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere,</hi> and two or three of our own Comick Poets, to <hi>Terence</hi> and <hi>Ariſtophanes.</hi> For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the deſign of Comedy, be to inſtruct or to pleaſe, or both, the Modern Comedy anſwers both thoſe ends incomparably better than the Ancient. If the end of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy be only to pleaſe, why then it muſt pleaſe by the <hi>Ridiculum</hi>; for that which is the end of any ſort of Writing whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, muſt be attain'd by a way, that muſt diſtinguiſh that ſort of Writing. As, for example, the end of Tragedy and of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick Poetry is to inſtruct. But the latter inſtructs chiefly by Admiration, and the former by Compaſſion and Terror. Now Admiration diſtinguiſhes Heroick Poetry, and Compaſſion and Terror Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, from all other ſorts of Poems whatever; but the only thing that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes the pleaſure which Comedy gives us, from the pleaſure that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from all other ſorts of Poems whatever, is the <hi>Ridiculum.</hi> Now the <hi>Ridiculum</hi> in the Modern Comedy, is beyond Compariſon Higher than it is in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0391600400:82"/>
the new Comedy of the Ancients, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Compariſon more in Nature, than it is in the old one. And it is higher both in the Incidents, and in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. For if the end of Comedy is to pleaſe, and that end is to be attain'd by the <hi>Ridiculum,</hi> why then the <hi>Ridiculum</hi> ought to be ſpread throughout it. But beſides, that it is higher in the Modern Comedy, there is a greater variety of it both in the Incidents and in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and that variety muſt make it the more delightful. For a uniformity in this caſe takes away from the ſurprize, and without ſurprize the <hi>Ridiculum</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt. And beſides, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns have a greater variety both of Characters and Fables, they have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er variety of Style. For the Style of the Comedy of the Ancients, and particularly of <hi>Terence</hi> his Comedy, does not ſeem to me to be varied enough, nor proportioned enough to the Characters. The Slave in <hi>Terence</hi> ſpeaks with the ſame Elegance and the ſame Grace for the moſt part that his Maſter does. But look into the Plain Dealer, and you ſhall find as many Styles in it, as there are Characters. For <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Freeman, Planſible, Oliviae, Novel, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha,</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0391600400:83"/>
the Widow <hi>Blackacre</hi> and <hi>Jerry</hi> have each of them a different Dialect, which beſides the variety, muſt be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delightful, becauſe it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Imitation of Nature. For as every man has a different form of face, he has a different turn of mind, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a different caſt of thought, and a different manner of expreſſion. Add to this, that the Moderns ſeem to know men better, and to dive into ſome latent foibles, into ſome Ridiculous Receſſes, that were utterly unknown to the Ancients. So that in every good Comedy, at the ſame time, that we are diverted with the <hi>Ridiculum,</hi> we are entertained with Diſcoveries, which is very delightful; But if the chief deſign of Comedy be to inſtruct, as I make no queſtion but it is, becauſe publick ſpectacles ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the publick advantage, we ſhall find, that the Modern Comedy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers this end too better than that of the Antients. If the deſign of Comedy be to inſtruct, it muſt inſtruct by the <hi>Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi> for the very ſame Reaſon, that we affirm'd it muſt pleaſe by it, becauſe it is to be diſtinguiſhed by the means, by which it attains its end, But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>Ridiculum</hi> can diſtinguiſh
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0391600400:84"/>
Comedy from all other Poems. But Comedy inſtructing by the <hi>Ridiculum,</hi> that <hi>Ridiculum</hi> ought to be both in the Fables and Characters. Firſt, it ought to be in the Characters, or elſe it cannot be in the Incidents, and conſequently there can be no Comedy. For the manners of the Agents produce the Incidents. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it ought to be in the Incidents, or elſe it would follow, that there would be manners in the Agents, which are not productive of action, which ought not to be. Beſides, Comedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs by its Fables or Characters, or both. If it inſtructs only by its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as ſome Criticks have thought, yet the <hi>Ridiculum</hi> ought to be in the Action too, or the ſeriouſneſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents would check the inſtruction, as well as the pleaſure, which we receive from the Characters. But if it inſtructs by its Fable and Action, as certainly it ought to do, why then the <hi>Ridiculum</hi> muſt be in the incidents which are parts of the Action, becauſe Comedy inſtructs by the <hi>Ridiculum</hi>; and conſequently this laſt ought to reign chiefly in the Cataſtrophe, which ought to be the moſt inſtructive part of the Fable, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0391600400:85"/>
to make the ſtrongeſt impreſſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there are but two ways of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by example, and thoſe are, the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men Ridiculous for their faults, or unfortunate, to repreſent them expos'd by them, or chaſtis'd for them. But if Comedy ſhews men unfortunate, it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurps upon Tragedy. The great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the world are caus'd by great Paſſions, and they are puniſh'd by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy. The little Paſſions cauſe little Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, and make us uneaſie to our ſelves and one another, and they are expos'd by Comedy. For, that which we call Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in Comedy, is nothing but a little Ridiculous paſſion, and the expoſing it in Comedy is thought to be Poetical Juſtice ſufficient for it: Not but that at laſt the Characters in Comedy may be chaſtiz'd at the Cataſtrophe for faults which they have committed; but that very Chaſtiſement ought to be wrapt up in the <hi>Ridiculum,</hi> or the Cataſtrophe cannot be truly Comical. For as the Cataſtrophe of a Tragedy ought to be the moſt Tragical part of it, becauſe Tragedy inſtructing by Compaſſion and Terror, thoſe two Paſſions ought to be moſt ſtrongly mov'd in the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive part of the Fable; ſo the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0391600400:86"/>
of a Comedy ought to be the moſt Comical part of it for the very ſame reaſon; for Comedy inſtructing by the <hi>Ridiculum,</hi> as has been ſhewn above, the moſt Inſtructive part of it ought to be moſt Ridiculous. But now if 'tis the end of Comedy to Inſtruct, and it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs by the <hi>Ridiculum,</hi> the Modern Comedy muſt be more Inſtructive than the Ancient could be. For the <hi>Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> in the old Comedy of the Ancients, was very often out of Nature, both in the Characters and in the Incidents, and conſequently could not inſtruct. And the <hi>Ridiculum</hi> in their new Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being not ſo ſtrong as it is in ours, neither in their Characters not in their Incidents, could not Inſttuct ſo powerfully; and the Moderns having greater variety of it both in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and action, the Inſtruction in the Modern Comedy muſt be the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, beſides that the variety of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Incidents muſt make our Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophes more ſurprizing, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more Ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>So that the Modern Comedy pleaſing more, and inſtructing more, and ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the two ends of Comedy better than the Ancient did, it follows that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0391600400:87"/>
the Moderns in Comedy are preferrable to the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>As the Moderns have excell'd the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in Comedy, they have equall'd them in Satyr. There has been a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute among the Criticks, whether <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> or <hi>Juvenal</hi> ought to be preferr'd in Satyr. Their excellencies indeed are are very different, and therefore a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is not eaſie to be made. <hi>Horace</hi> had a great deal of pleaſantry, and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> a great deal of force, at leaſt for his way of writing. Now <hi>Boilean</hi> has juſtly got a great Reputation both for force and pleaſantry, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is equal to either of the <hi>Roman</hi> Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts; And here it will not be amiſs to obſerve, that the very ſame Poets among the Moderns, who have ſurpaſs'd the Ancients in Comedy, and who have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd them in Satyr, have faln infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort of them when they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the greater Poetry, as <hi>Ben John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> comes behind them in Tragedy, and <hi>Boilean</hi> in the greater Ode.</p>
                  <p>As for Hiſtorical Poetry, any one who is acquainted with <hi>Lucan</hi> may have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that where that Author is very great, he derives his greatneſs from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; as he does, for example, in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0391600400:88"/>
Speech, which is a kind of Abſtract of the Religion and Metaphyſicks of the Stoicks.</p>

                     <hi>Lucan</hi> is very far from being ſo exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where as he is here. For,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0391600400:91"/>
where-ever he is very great and poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, he muſt be ſo by the greatneſs of ordinary paſſion, or by the force of Enthuſiaſm. But ordinary paſſions can neither be very frequent in an Hiſtorical Poem; nor if they could, could they be frequently great. Becauſe there being no Fable, and no Art, they can ſeldom be rightly prepar'd. Nor can the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms be frequently great where there is no Religion. But Religion cannot be frequent in an Hiſtorical Poem, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is in Sacred Hiſtory. If any one would give himſelf the trouble of comparing the Twelfth Book of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> with the ſeventh of the <hi>Pharſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> he would find that <hi>Virgil</hi> is ten times greater than <hi>Lucan,</hi> and that <hi>Lucan</hi>'s ſubject, as far as it is Humane, is ten times greater than <hi>Virgil</hi>'s. For, I hope, no man will compare <hi>Aeneas,</hi> take him without his Divine Dependencies with <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> the greateſt of men, nor the Combat that made the former King of the <hi>Latins,</hi> with the Battel that made <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Abſolute Maſter of the World. From whence it would follow, if the greatneſs of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Subject conſiſts in any thing Humane, that either <hi>Lucan</hi>'s writing in his Seventh Book is twenty
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0391600400:92"/>
times below his Subject, or that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Twelfth Book is twenty times above his. But <hi>Lucan</hi>'s writing in his Seventh Book is not twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times below his Subject, as any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Poet that ſhould be oblig'd to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that Subject after him, would be forc'd to confeſs. Nor is the writing of <hi>Virgil</hi> in the laſt of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> ſo many degrees above his ſubject. For if it is, then that laſt Book is ſcurvily writ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thoughts and expreſſions ought to be proportion'd to the things. But the laſt Book of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> is admirably writ. What then can be the meaning of all this? Why the meaning muſt be, that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s ſubject is twenty times great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>Lucan</hi>'s. But <hi>Lucan</hi>'s ſubject is ten times greater than his as far as it is only Humane, which has been made to appear. The excellency then of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s ſubject muſt come from ſomething that is not Humane, and that muſt be from Religion; ſo <hi>Virgil</hi>'s greatneſs and his Enthuſiaſm comes from his Machines, and the Miniſtery of the Gods, and the other parts of his Religion, and <hi>Lucan</hi>'s littleneſs, from his want of thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, and that Miniſtery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Arbiter, Lucan</hi>'s Contemporary, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible of this. For he, tho an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean profeſt, was ſo ſenſible of the Advantage that Poetry deriv'd from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that in the Beginning of his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyricon,</hi> after he has been exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Writers of the Times, and particularly againſt <hi>Lucan,</hi> he offers this expedient for the reſtoring Poetry to its former greatneſs, that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to its former Religion. But to return to <hi>Lucan</hi>; He is often tedious and ſpiritleſs, becauſe his Subject is not only meerly Humane, but it's ſometimes Impious. For <hi>Lucan</hi> had conceiv'd the moſt extravagant Deſign in the World. For at the ſame time that he ſets up for a Stoick, he writes a Book to prove ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there is no ſuch thing as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the World, or that the Gods favour'd Injuſtice.</p>

We have ſhewn that the Subject of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> in the Twelfth of his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> is very much greater than <hi>Lucan</hi>'s is in the Seventh of his <hi>Pharſalia.</hi> We have ſhewn too, at the ſame time, that <hi>Lucan</hi>'s was greater as He found it, and that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s was greater as He made it. For I hope I need ſay nothing at this time of day to prove that the Religious part of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Subject was Invented and Diſpos'd by the Poet. Which may ſhow the benefit of Art, that is, of Rules in Poetry. For, tho 'tis by the Genius of a Writer, that is, by a Soul that has the power of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing great Paſſions, whether ordinary or Enthuſiaſtick, that we treat a Subject with Dignity equal to its greatneſs, yet 'tis Art that makes a Subject very great, and conſequently gives occaſion for a great Genius to ſhew it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſhewn that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did not excel the Moderns in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and Satyr, which are not Sacred Poems, as having neither Invocations, Apoſtrophes, Revelations or Machines; at leaſt the new Comedy had none of all theſe, and the old one only ſome low Burleſque or elſe Groteſque ones. We have ſhewn too that the Sacred Poetry
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0391600400:95"/>
of the Ancients, was beyond compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon greater than their Hiſtorical Poetry, becauſe it was not Sacred.</p>

               <div n="10" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. X. That in their Sacred Poetry, in which the Ancients, excell'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, thoſe places were greateſt, and moſt Poetical that had moſt of Religion.</head>
                  <p>But as the Ancients did not ſurpaſs the Moderns in Poetry that was not Sacred, ſo in that ſort of Poetry where they did excel them, they were never ſo admirable as where they were moſt Religious. Now the paſſages of the Ancient Poets, which ſeem to have moſt Religion in them, are either thoſe addreſſes by which men approach'd the Gods, as Invocations, Apoſtrophes, and the like; or thoſe condeſcenſions, by which the Gods communicated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to men, as Revelations, Machines,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0391600400:96"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the firſt of which are Duties that belong to univerſal Natural Religion, the ſecond to Religion which is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, Extraordinary and Miraculous. Every thing that is great in Poetry muſt be great by the Genius that is felt in it, which is the chief thing in Poetry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general acceptation of it; and the principal thing in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Poetica,</hi> or the Body of Poetry. Now all Genius is Paſſion becauſe it moves, and all Paſſion is either Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm or ordinary Paſſion, as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd above. Now that even ordinary Paſſion in Poetry is heighten'd by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we ſhall endeavour to prove. And we ſhall moſt inſiſt upon thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſſions, which are moſt to be found in Tragedy and in Epick Poetry. For, as for the greater Ode, that ſeems to be the peculiar province of Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm, and ordinary Paſſions in that are more rarely to be met with.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then Admiration, which is the Reigning Paſſion in Epick Poetry, I mean that which is admirable in the action of the Hero, is heighten'd by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, by Machines, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Gods. For that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0391600400:97"/>
thoſe Machines, and thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations are all Miraculous. And the man who was admirable before for his extraordinary Valour and his Native Greatneſs, becomes more wonderful, when we behold him the eſteem and immediate concern of Heaven, when we ſee him the 'peculiar care of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, when we find the order of Nature inverted, the Skies grown facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon his account, and Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to ſuſtain or oppoſe him.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, Terror and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are the Reigning Paſſions in Tragedy are Heighten'd by Religion. Tragedy, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Poetick, is the Imitation of an action which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites Compaſſion and Terror. Now thoſe two Paſſions proceed from Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, when the Incidents ſpring one from another againſt our expectation. For thoſe Incidents, continues the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, are always more admirable than thoſe which arrive by chance; which is evident from this, ſays he, that even of accidental things, thoſe are always the moſt wonderful and moſt ſurprizing, which at the ſame time that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0391600400:98"/>
they arrive by Chance, ſeem to fall out by Deſign; and by a certain particular ſecret conduct, of which Nature was what they relate of the Statue of <hi>Mitys</hi> at <hi>Argos,</hi> which fell upon his Murderer, and kill'd him upon the ſpot, in the midſt of a great Aſſembly. For that by no means, ſays the Philoſopher, ſeems to be the work of Chance. From whence ir follows, ſays he, of neceſſity, that thoſe Fables where there is this conduct, will always ſeem preferable to thoſe that have it not. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> declares that the Wonderful in Tragedy, as well as in Epick Poetry, is Heightned by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that thoſe Tragical Incidents that appear to have moſt of Providence in them, are always moſt moving and Terrible. The Reaſon is plain. For all cur Paſſions are grounded upon the Love of our ſelves; and Terror and Compaſſion ſpring from the Calamities of our equals; that is, of thoſe who being in circumſtances reſembling ours, and committing faults which we either commit, or to which we are liable, are upon that unfortunate. For the more there appears to be of Providence in the puniſhment, the more we pity the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0391600400:99"/>
For if their calamities appear to be the work of Chance, they might as well have hapned to thoſe who have not committed ſuch faults, as to thoſe who have. And therefore a Train of Incidents, which, contrary to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, ſurprizingly produce one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is neceſſary, becauſe the more plainly the puniſhment appears the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the faults, and the more clearly we are convinc'd of this when we leaſt expect it, Providence appears the more in the caſe, and our ſecurity is ſhaken the more, and the more we are mov'd and Terrified. But Religion does not only heighten thoſe Paſſions which are great in themſelves, as Admiration and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror are; for Admiration raiſes the Soul, and every thing that is Terrible, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly great to him to whom it is Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, but it ennobles thoſe which are commonly baſe and dejected; as for example, Grief; witneſs that paſſage in the Paſſion of <hi>Dido:</hi>

                  <p>And that Sublime Apoſtrophe of <hi>Seinon</hi> in the Second Book:</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>But to come to the other ſort of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which gives Poetry its force and its greatneſs, Religious Enthuſiaſm muſt neceſſarily be greater than Human En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm can be, becauſe the Paſſions that attend on Religious Ideas, when a man is capable of Reflecting on them as he ſhould do, are ſtronger than thoſe which attend on Prophane Ideas, as has been ſaid above, and has been partly ſhewn by examples. And as ordinary Paſſion is Heightned by Religion, ſo Human Enthuſiaſtick Paſſions are height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0391600400:101"/>
by Religious Enthuſiaſm. We ſhall give an example of this in Terror, by which I mean not that Common Paſſion which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> treats of in his Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and in his Poetick, and of which we ſpoke in the former part of this Chapter; but that Enthuſiaſtick Terror, which ſprings from the Ideas unknown to him who feels it. <hi>Virgil</hi> in his firſt Book of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> deſcribes a Tempeſt, which carries Double Terror along with it; the ordinary one, which ſprings from the concern which we have for the Hero; and the Enthuſiaſtick one, which the Ideas would carry along with them, tho they were ſeparated from that concern which we feel for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro. The Deſcription is Grave, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and Exalted, becauſe the Poet was mov'd by the Terrible Ideas. For that which is Terrible, is always great to him to whom it is Terrible, as we ſaid before; and that which is Great is Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and then he who is Terrified is always ſerious, and very much in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. The ſame Deſcription where the Terror is at the Height is vehement.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Becauſe that which is very Terrible is Wonderful and Aſtoniſhing, and he who is aſtoniſh'd, being tranſported be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond himſelf, muſt of neceſſity expreſs himſelf with that ſort of Fury which we call Vehemence. <hi>Virgil,</hi> by ſetting ſo many Terrible Images in motion, had ſet this Tempeſt before his Eyes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had tranſported himſelf as it were into it. Now, any one who has been upon the brink of a Wreck, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently has been very much Terrify'd himſelf, and ſeen others Aſtoniſh'd, cannot but have felt the ſame motions that he feels in Reading this paſſage, and cannot but have obſerv'd that others who felt them, expreſs'd themſelves with the ſame Fury and Vehemence that the Poet does, tho not with the ſame Elegance. But tho this Storm is Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ſelf and Wonderful, yet the Machines, which prepare, and raiſe, and allay it, very much add to its Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0391600400:103"/>
and genuine Terror, and it is quite another thing when it is conſider'd with the cauſe of it, which is the Anger of <hi>Juno,</hi> and the Compliance of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and with that which follow'd upon it, which is the Indignation of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and the exertion of his abſolute power.</p>
                  <p>The paſſages of the Ancient Poets that were moſt Religious, were their Invocations, Apoſtrophes, or the like; or thoſe which contain'd the Miraculous part of their Religion, their Signs, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, Oracles, and other Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>For their Invocations, Apoſtrophes, and the like, which were all of them either a ſort of Prayers, or Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, they are moſt of them very ſublime, and attended with a ſtrong Enthuſiaſm. And how could it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but that the Ancient Poets, who were men of great Learning, of great Paſſions great Eloquence, and great Parts; when with ſtudy and pains, and with all their endeavours to be Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick, they addreſs'd themſelves to their Gods, ſhould be extremely agitated, when we ſee very plainly that a ſort of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Enthuſiaſts, who have neither
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0391600400:104"/>
Learning nor Parts, nor the leaſt tincture of good Letters, are even in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore Prayers diſturb'd with very fierce Enthuſiaſms.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. That the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poetry flouriſh'd with their Religion.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion flouriſh'd in <hi>Greece</hi> from the time of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who was either the Original Inſtituter,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0391600400:112"/>
or at leaſt a vehement propogater of that Idolatry, till the Age after that in which <hi>Sophocles</hi> flouriſh'd, that is, for the ſpace of about eight hundred years, and in that ſpace of time flouriſh'd all their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, who are celebrated for their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in that ſort of Poetry which we call Sacred. Which alone is a ſtrong preſumption, that theſe Poets deriv'd their excellence from Religion. In ſhort, the advantage which their Poetry drew from Religion muſt needs be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, when for all or moſt of the fore-mention'd ſpace of time, according to the Teſtimony of <hi>Plutatch,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others of their authentick Writers, it made moſt of their Zealots, even their common people Poets, and that even in their ordinary converſation. I muſt confeſs, the Gentleman who writ the Hiſtory of Oracles, treats this as a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Fiction ſo palpable as not to be worth the anſwering. But perhaps that Gentleman had not conſider'd this matter enough. For I deſire the Reader to conſider two things. Firſt, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary incentives which thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had to Enthuſiaſm, which is one qualification for Poetry; and ſecondly,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0391600400:113"/>
the habit which they might very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably contract of Verſification. To be ſatisfied of the firſt, let us enquire a little into the nature of their Religion: And upon enquiry we ſhall find, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſource, and ſpring and ſoul of it was an imaginary or pretended Revelation, and that that Revelation was ſuppos'd to be conſtant and continual, as it muſt be of every Religion which has no ſound Morality. They had their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Revelations, as Oracles, Viſions, Dreams, Apparitions. And Gods and Goddeſſes, Nymphs and Demi-gods, Fawns and Satyrs were ſeen by Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in every Grove, on every Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and in every Valley, as ſoon as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Horrors of the place, or its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or their fears, or their wiſhes, or their contemplations had diſpos'd their minds to be Religiouſly impos'd upon. Now what ſort of Paſſions, and what ſort of Spirit muſt be produc'd in them by theſe Imaginations, we may gueſs by what happens among our ſelves, when any one believes that he has ſeen an Apparition. The man is alter'd quite in a moment; his colour, his mein, his comportment are all different: Nor are
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0391600400:114"/>
they who hear him the ſame, but are all of them ſurpriz'd, tranſported, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and all of them very profoundly attentive. Now very few that have any Judgment have any Notion that an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition will do them any harm, nor has any one an example of it, that may be eaſily credited. But the Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> had notions, that their Gods had power to deſtroy them, or make them happy, and they had a thouſand Examples of it, in <hi>Muſeus,</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> and the reſt of the Fathers of their Church, which muſt cauſe the Emotions upon the fancied Apparitions, or the Relations of them to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and fill their Souls with more turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſions, and a greater Religious Horror.</p>
                  <p>But then let us conſider, ſecondly, that theſe Zealots muſt in ſome meaſure have contracted a Habit of Verſiſicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their Religious duties. For the very common People in <hi>Greece,</hi> had with quick apprehenſions a great deal of vivacity; and therefore I leave the Reader to gueſs, what effect the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Muſeus,</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and the reſt of the Fathers of their Church,

                  <p>And why may not that Habit, joyn'd to their continual Enthuſiaſtick Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they had, either from the Revelations which they fancied that the Gods imparted to themſelves, or from the Relations of thoſe, which they believed were vouchſafed to others; or from the performance of the foreſaid Religious Duties, and from their Ritual, which their Poets had compos'd with ſo much Enthuſiaſm, capacitate them to expreſs, themſelves Poetically even in common Society; as well as ſome whole Sects of our Modern Fanaticks in <hi>England,</hi> who have by no means the vivacity of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> are enabled from the continual Reading of Scripture, and the Imaginary Dictates of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit, to make up their ordinary converſation almoſt wholly of Scripture language.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. Objection anſwered.</head>
                  <p>BUt here 'tis convenient to anſwer an Objection; for here it will be urg'd, that the Ancient Poets among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> being men of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary parts, could not believe any thing ſo abſurd as the Revelations and Miracles mention'd in the former Chapter, and conſequently could not draw any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from them. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that firſt they might draw an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from them tho they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them; and ſecondly, that they did believe them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Suppoſing they did not believe them, yet they might very well draw their advantage from them. For every one is brought up in the Reveal'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of his Country, and conſequently believes it for the firſt part of his life. Now every one knows that the force of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0391600400:118"/>
Education, and the Influence of firſt Impreſſions is great, and eſpecially upon the minds of thoſe who have ſtrong Imaginations. And ſuppoſing that the Poets, when they ſet themſelves to write, were not ſatisfied about the Truth of the Revelations of which they treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the former ſtrong Enthuſiaſtick motions, that they were wont to have upon the like Ideas in the firſt years of their youth, would certainly follow upon them again, whenever they had heartily a mind to give into them.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, a man may have a very good underſtanding, and yet believe a falſe, nay, even an abſurd Revelation. The Revelation of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is both falſe and abſurd, and yet ſeveral among the <hi>Turks,</hi> who have ſhewn themſelves men of extraordinary parts for ſeveral years together, have at laſt convinc'd the world of the ſincerity of their belief, by very frankly ſubmitting to die at the Command of their Emperors, when they could with a great deal of eaſe have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd it. For 'tis ſo reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there ſhould be ſuch a thing as Revelation, of which we ſhall ſpeak more at large anon; and all Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0391600400:119"/>
are ſo little to be comprehended by us, that a man even of a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will be oblig'd to believe an abſurd one rather than none. Beſides, the Ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets knew no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion than the <hi>Grecian</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For they had neither any clear Idea of one Supreme Independent Being, nor any tolerable knowledge of the Law of Nature. For all the great Poets among the <hi>Grecians</hi> flouriſh'd before the Doctrine of <hi>Socrates</hi> was eſtabliſh'd in the world, and before that eſtabliſhment they had neither any certain knowledge of the True God, nor any tolerable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law of Nature. For had there been that, there would have been a ſyſtem of Morality; but <hi>Socrates</hi> was the firſt who introduc'd Moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy into that part of the world.</p>
                  <p>And here the Mythologiſts may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as long as they pleaſe, that the Ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets, by the number of their falſe Gods, meant only the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent notions of the true. 'Tis plain they had no clear and diſtinct Idea of one Supreme and Infinite Being: For either the Knowledge of the True God muſt be drawn from Reaſon or Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0391600400:120"/>
From Revelation they could not draw it, becauſe their own Revelation was not true: And if they had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God from any other Revelation, of which perhaps ſome of them might have heard imperfectly, why then that knowledge was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and could conſequently not be clear: And to deduce that knowledge from Reaſon a man muſt uſe a great deal of attention and a great deal of application. But in thoſe times the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the <hi>Grecians</hi> was too great, and their Paſſions were too ſtrong, and the Exerciſe of Reaſon was too little known among them, to uſe either the attention or the application. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, there is ſomething in the Ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets that is repugnant to the Divine Nature, as is known to every one who has been converſant with them, and that alone renders all the Conjectures of the Mythologiſts Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, we have a great deal of Reaſon to be convinc'd that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets, I mean their Sacred Poets, did believe the Revelations they neated of, becauſe as their Poetry flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0391600400:121"/>
with their Revelation, ſo at laſt it fail'd with it, as we ſhall ſhew at large in the following Chapter.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. That the greater Poetry among the <hi>Graecians</hi> fail'd with their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</head>
                  <p>AS Epick Poetry, Tragedy, and the Greater Ode, flouriſh'd with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among the Ancient <hi>Grecians,</hi> ſo together with Religion they fail'd. Now in order to the proving this, let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how and when the <hi>Grecian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion fail'd. We have ſaid in one of the former Chapters, that the very ſpring and ſoul of that Religion was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant continual Revelation, as it muſt neceſſarily have been of ſuch a Religion as had no Morality. The <hi>Grecians</hi> worſhipp'd many Gods, but before they worſhipp'd them, they muſt believe that they were, and that they wanted neither power nor will to make them either hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0391600400:122"/>
or miſerablc. Now of theſe two things they were convinc'd by Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or pretended Revelations, as by Oracles, Viſions, Dreams, Apparitions, and a thouſand Fantaſtick Miracles. Now as long as theſe were in credit in <hi>Greece</hi> Polytheiſm went on Triumphantly. For they who had neither any inſight into the True Religion, nor any tolerable habit of Reaſoning, could never argue againſt matter of Fact as long as they made no doubt of the Truth of it. But as ſoon as the matter of fact came to be ſuſpected, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Worſhip was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermin'd and weaken'd very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. To be convinc'd of this, we need only conſider the Deſign of that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the methods of carrying it on, and we ſhall find that that very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and thoſe very Methods, made a certain way for its ruine. We have ſaid above that no Religion which wants Morality can outlaſt its Revelation. For if Morality is not for it, it will be againſt it. And 'tis impoſſible to conceive how any Religion can be permanent, which has neither Miracles nor Human Reaſon to ſupport it. Now it will be an eaſie matter to ſhew two things, firſt, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0391600400:123"/>
the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion was without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; and ſecondly, that the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, and the Methods of carrying on that Deſign, introduc'd Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, by a very natural prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Deſign of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion, ſeems to me to be the providing for the Happineſs of Mankind in this life, by drawing them out of a ſtate of War, and making them live peaceably and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely among one another.</p>

                     <l>Sylveſtres Homines, Sacer Interpreſ<expan>

                  <p>Says <hi>Horace,</hi> in his little Treatiſe <hi>De Arte Poetica.</hi> That is:</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the Sacred Interpreter of the Gods, deterr'd ſavage men from Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering one another, and reclaim'd them from the Barbarous Brutal lives which they led.</q>
                  <p>Now this Deſign he was to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by Religion, and Revealing the pretended will of the Gods. In order to which it was neceſſary to give the people
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0391600400:124"/>
ſuch a Religion as might be agreeable to them in the condition in which they were. For otherwiſe they would not have hearken'd to it. Now, to give them a Religion that might be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, it was neceſſary to give them ſuch a one as might Maintain and Indulge their Paſſions. For, when the <hi>Grecian</hi> Worſhip was firſt inſtituted, the corruption of that people was ſo very great, that tho the Inſtituter had known the pure Law of Nature, he durſt never have preach'd it to them, becauſe their Paſſions were then too ſtrong to receive it. Well, then <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or <hi>Linus,</hi> or whoever was the firſt Inſtituter of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion, was oblig'd to Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Indulge the Paſſions, which I am apt to believe that he had no notion of ſuppreſſing, becauſe he believ'd them all to be natural, and ſaw by experience that ſome of them contributed to the Pleaſure and Happineſs of Mankind. The Inſtituter then of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was oblig'd to Maintain the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but here lay the difficulty. The very crimes that kept men aſunder, and in a ſtate of War, were caus'd by ſome of thoſe very Paſſions; what then was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0391600400:125"/>
to be done in this caſe? Why, He was oblig'd to give thoſe Paſſions a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to Indulge and Maintain the reſt in the ſame condition in which he found them. As for example, Rage and Fury were the principal paſſions that maintain'd men in a ſtate of War, and occaſion'd the frequent Murders that were daily committed among them. Now theſe paſſions being grown up with them, and by conſequence become habitual to them, it would have been very difficult, if not impoſſible, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them. The firſt Inſtituter then of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion thought fit to give thoſe paſſions a vent a leſs cruel way, and for that purpoſe in all likelihood inſtituted the <hi>Orgies of Bacchus.</hi> But the paſſions that were not utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Society, he indulg'd in the condition in which he found them, as the Love of Women, Wine, &amp;c. For, all that the Founder of that Religion could pretend to at firſt, was to bring men out of a greater confuſion into a leſs, and not to reduce them to perfect order. Therefore, by ſhewing the Gods addicted to theſe paſſions, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd the people to cheriſh them, nay,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0391600400:126"/>
to ſuch an Intemperance as was repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the original Law of Nature, nay, even to ſuch a criminal degree, as was afterwards forbidden by the Laws of the <hi>Grecian</hi> States. For Intemperance in the uſe of Wine and of Women is contrary to the Dictates of Natures ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Law, and yet was encourag'd by the Examples of ſome of their Gods, and Rapes and Adulteries and Inceſt were encourag'd by the ſame Examples at firſt, without any manner of Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>check. For, either the Syſtem of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Theology was contriv'd at firſt without any Infernal Puniſhments, or they were only threaten'd to ſuch crimes as were contradictory of civil Society. But afterwards, as Confuſion leſſen'd, and Order increas'd, and other Crimes were found to be more repugnant to Community, and ſo were forbidden by the Laws, the Magiſtrates in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood oblig'd the ſucceeding Poets to threaten thoſe who dar'd to commit them, with the puniſhments of another World, and ſo to make up the Infernal Scheme by Degrees. Thus have I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to ſhew by the moſt probable Conjectures I could make, what was the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0391600400:127"/>
original Deſign of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and what method he took to compaſs it. But this is paſt all doubt, that the original Revelation of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Worſhip was Repugnant in ſeveral points to the primitive Law of Nature, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Laws of the <hi>Grecian</hi> States. Now the method which <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or whoever was the firſt founder of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion, had taken, was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by ſucceeding Poets, only here and there, as occaſion ſerv'd, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled precepts of Juſtice and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; which precepts are by no means to be look'd upon as parts of that Revelation, but as Remnants of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion and of the Law of Nature, which the Paſſions had not been able totally to ſuppreſs; or the efforts and ſtrugglings of Reaſon, recovering from its Lethargy by Degrees. But the Poets and Law-givers could not give good precepts with a great deal of good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as long as the Gods were believ'd to give ill examples. For the people look'd upon their Laws, unleſs they were inforc'd by Religion, as made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the conveniency of life, and trangſgreſt them whenever they could
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0391600400:128"/>
with Impunity; and the precepts ſcat ter'd up and down in the Poems wer but Impotent Imperfect efforts of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and utterly unable to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a continual conſtant Revelation, and a train of perpetual Miracles.</p>
                  <p>But now let us conſider how this Deſign of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or whoever was the firſt Inſtituter of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion, let us ſee how his Deſign in ſetting up his Theology, together with the Methods that were us'd for carrying it on by him and ſucceeding Poets, ſecretly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd the way for its utter ruine. For the bringing men in a body together, and cauſing them more frequently to converſe with one another, was the firſt occaſion of the cultivating Humane Reaſon, and was conſequently one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the Introduction of Moral Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>And the Laws that were made by their Legiſlators, and the Precepts that were given by their Prieſts and Poets, in conſequence of mens convening and converſing together, had been ſenſible encroachments upon the Revelation, as being manifeſt contradictions of it, if men had been us'd to reflect. At laſt,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0391600400:129"/>
after Miracles and Revelations had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed for the ſpace of almoſt eight hundred years, <hi>Socrates</hi> aroſe a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary man, who finding that the Precepts that had been ſcattered here and there, for the Regulation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, and the Laws that had been given for the maintaining of Order in Communities, were all contradictory of the Revelation, but all agreeing perfectly with one another in the promoting of the ſame Deſign, which was the welfare of thoſe who obſerv'd them, he had reaſon to enquire a little more narrowly into the Revelation, and to find that that was contradictory too of it ſelf. For the Celeſtial and the Infernal Schemes of the Ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> Theology, ſeem'd ſo utterly inconſiſtent, that as I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they could never be conceiv'd to be both given ou't at a time; but it was reaſonable to believe, that firſt the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Scheme was invented, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Infernal made up by degrees, in order to the ſerving the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For not only the Infernal Deities rigorouſly puniſh'd thoſe very Crimes, which the Celeſtial Gods had by their Examples encourag'd men to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0391600400:130"/>
commit: but which is very odd to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider, their Hell ſeem'd to be fill'd with their Good Gods, and their Heaven with Devils. For whether we conſider <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> or <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> or the Judges, or the Fates, or the Furies, theſe were all of them very rigorous, and if you pleaſe inexorable; but then they were all of them very juſt, and foes and inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie only to guilt, and never any of them did any harm to Virtue. But at the ſame time that the Magiſtracy of Hell was compos'd of theſe honeſt upright Perſons, Heaven on the other ſide was fill'd with all ſorrs of Scoundrels, Rakes, Cuckolds, Bullies, Pimps and Bawds, and Cuckold makers; and no Virtue, and no Innocence could ſecure either Men or Women, from theſe Immortal Scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Nay, men often ſuffer'd for their Temperance, and women for their Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Socrates</hi> then conſidering the abſurdity of the Revelation, and the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Laws and Precepts that were diſtinct from it: The agreement of the latter among themſelves, and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of the former, cultivated the one, and contemn'd the other, and by the force of a ſtrong and clear Reaſon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0391600400:131"/>
and a long converſation with all ſorts of people, brought the Exerciſe and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of reaſoning into Requeſt, and by little and little introduced a ſyſtem of Morality, reſtor'd in ſome meaſure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, and recover'd the Law of Nature. Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> gave the world a Syſtem of Morality, and tho his Contemporaries had not reaſon enough to make the diſcovery themſelves, yet they had ſenſe enough to approve of it when it was made, and to be convinc'd of the Truth of it, and conſequently to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd that the Revelation was falſe. For ſeeing that Virtue, and Order and Happineſs, I mean in ſome degree, ſprung from Philoſophy, and Vice and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Miſery from the Revelation; and ſeeing the Philoſophy was eſtabliſh'd by Inferences, which very naturally flow'd from theſe Intelligent Faculties, which, whatever power had form'd man, had given him to be his guide; and ſeeing the Philoſophy and the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contradictory one of another, they could not find in their hearts to believe that the Gods could be ſo unjuſt as to deſign the miſery and confuſion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or ſo abſurd as to give them two
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0391600400:132"/>
rules to walk by, that were contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory one of another.</p>
                  <p>The eſtabliſtment then of Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, was the ruine of the old Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and ſo made way for a new. For after the death of <hi>Socrates,</hi> there ſtarted up ſeveral Sects of Philoſophers, as the <hi>Cyrenaicks, Cynicks, Peripateticks, Epicureans, Scepticks,</hi> ſome of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, but all within a hundred and fifty years, who were all of them mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies, not only to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Revelation, but to Reveal'd Religion in general: Tho in the laſt they certainly went beyond the deſign of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maſter <hi>Socrates,</hi> whoſe intention was to reform Revelation, and not to ruin it. And thus upon the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Moral Philoſophy, the credit of Oracles was diminiſh'd conſiderably, and Apparitions, Viſions, &amp;c. were contemn'd and exploded, and with them down went the greater Poetry: for you will find upon enquiry, that there was no Poet among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who was born after the death of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who writ with a great Spirit.</p>

And he had need have very groſs people to deal with, that could ſwallow ſuch a contradiction as that: For if no Form or Likeneſs of the Gods could be made, in what Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could they appear to him, or how could he diſtinguiſh <hi>Aegeria</hi> from the Muſes, or the Muſes from one another?

For as his Authority was grounded upon the Fiction, ſo it was ſtrengthen'd by the Truth; for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the Immortal Powers to <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> had not made him ſo venerable, if ſuch Apparitions had been common to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0391600400:135"/>
every one. However, this contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſwallowed by the People, and <hi>Numa</hi> upon it, gain'd both his Points; for he was held to be a Sacred Perſon, and the Gods were eſteem'd inviſible. So that for a hundred and ſixty years, ſays <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Numa,</hi> there was no ſuch thing as a Statue in their Temples, nor any talk of the Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to them. For how could thoſe numerous Gods, whom they worſhipp'd, with any poſſibility appear to them, ſince they could make no likeneſs of them. At length, the Superſtition of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Idolatry by degrees encreas'd upon them; and having conquer'd <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ſo got an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the Arts, and leiſure at once to cultivate them, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Arts grew up together among them; and of all the Arts Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was the firſt that was cultivated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was incorporated with their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. So that thereappears to me to be this conſiderable difference between the greater Poetry of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and that which was among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the <hi>Grecians</hi> deriv'd their Poetick Enthuſiaſm from the Miracles of their Religion,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0391600400:136"/>
and the <hi>Romans</hi> borrow'd theirs in ſome meaſure from the <hi>Grecians.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>So that the latter appears to me to be but a Copy as it were of the former. For, in effect, the <hi>Romans</hi> copied the <hi>Grecian</hi> Spirit: For we have ſhown from <hi>Horace</hi> the beſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Criticks, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had no ſuch thing among them till they had conquer'd <hi>Greece,</hi> nor had they any ſuch frequent Impulſes to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, and having the ſame Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the time that they cultivated Poetry, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> had, they could hardly ſay any thing of their Gods or their Demi-Gods, or their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Transformations, that the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Poets had not ſaid before them. Beſides, the moſt famous of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets copied particular <hi>Grecian</hi> Authors, as <hi>Horace</hi> did <hi>Pindar,</hi> and conſequently fell ſhort of them in the freeneſs and flame of their Spirit, as Copies muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily do of Originals. And as for the Tragedies that were among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0391600400:137"/>
the beſt of them were directly tranſlated from the <hi>Athenian</hi> Poets.</p>
                  <p>Since then the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets copied the <hi>Grecian</hi> Spirit, what is the reaſon that the <hi>Romans</hi> copied them ſo much better than we do? Why, firſt, they underſtood them better, and were more familiar with them, becauſe then the <hi>Grecian</hi> was a living language, and <hi>Rome</hi> had a continual correſpondence with <hi>Athens.</hi> Secondly, they had a more beautiful and more harmonious language to receive that Spirit; and laſtly and chiefly, that Religion from which it was deriv'd made greater impreſſions upon them than it does upon us. And in order to the making that appear, we ſhall ſhow that Poetry among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> flouriſh'd and fail'd with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>Poetry began to be cultivated at <hi>Rome</hi> after the Conqueſt of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the end of the Thid <hi>Punick</hi> War.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Serus enim Graecis admovit acumina chartis</l>

                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0391600400:138"/>
Now nothing is more reaſonable than to believe that the <hi>Grecian</hi> Superſtition, from which the Spirit of their Poetry was deriv'd, was at a greater height at <hi>Rome,</hi> after the <hi>Romans</hi> had conquer'd the <hi>Grecians,</hi> than it could be before they had a continual correſpondence with that people. But beſides, Religion in the main may be thought to be in a very great eſteem among the <hi>Romans</hi> about the time that they began to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Poetry.</p>
                  <p>In order to the proving which, let us enquire what was the fountain and ſource of Religion among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and upon what it chiefly depended. The chief ſupport of Religion among the <hi>Grecians</hi> was the conſtant Revelation by Oracles; but the <hi>Italian</hi> Oracles were more rare, and of much leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown. The prop and ſupport of the <hi>Roman</hi> Superſtition lay in their Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as <hi>Machiavel</hi> in his Diſcourſes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. For, ſays <hi>Machiavel,</hi> they eaſily believ'd that that Divinity that foretold their felicity had the power to effect it. <hi>Machiavel</hi> had reaſon to be of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For, how could their Gods be thought certainly to foretell what it was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0391600400:139"/>
not in their power certainly to effect? And thus did the <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip depend in a very peculiar manner upon the credit of their Divinations. But now let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in what credit the Divinations were when Poetry began to be cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; which, as we obſerv'd above, was after the third <hi>Punick</hi> War.</p>
                  <p>Now the credit of the Augurs and the Aruſpices muſt needs at that time be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great with the <hi>Romans.</hi> For, ſince good Fortune alone inclines men to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and to confide in the Gods, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has obſerv'd in the Second Book of his Rhetorick; what thoughts muſt not the <hi>Romans</hi> have of their Soothſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they were not only arriv'd at ſuch a Degree of Felicity, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that they ow'd all their greatneſs to the predictions of their Augurs. For they conſulted them upon every impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant conjuncture, and particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gave Battel. 'Tis true, they had ſometimes fail'd, but where they had fail'd once, they had ſucceeded ten times; which is evident from the felicity of that Commonwealth. Now, if one lucky gueſs can ſupport our ordinary Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers, who are wretched contemptible
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0391600400:140"/>
bonds, againſt a hundred that happen unfortunate, as we know by experience it does, in what height of Reputation muſt not the Soothſayers be, whoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſelf was held to be Sacred and Auguſt, when they had apparently ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ten times for their failing once. The <hi>Romans</hi> were now become the greateſt people upon the Earth, and the Promiſe of <hi>Romulus</hi> reveal'd to <hi>Proculus,</hi> according to the Oath of the latter, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be the Miſtreſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that promiſe, which at firſt ſeem'd ſo very incredible, was now very likely to be accompliſh'd. And the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> believ'd that they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the predictions of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners, as it were by ſo many ſteps, to that height of Glory, at which they were in Triumph arriv'd, and from the which they had a certain proſpect of becoming Maſtersof the Univerſe.</p>
                  <p>Divination then being in very great credit in the age in which Poetry began to be cultivated, Religion, which had its chief dependance upon it, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently needs be in very great credit too, which was the thing that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to prove.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0391600400:141"/>
But from what has been ſaid it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follows, that any one that ſhould have brought Divination into diſgrace, muſt have given a terrible ſhock to the ſuperſtition of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Now, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a hundred and threeſcore years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Poetry began to be cultivated, being introduc'd by <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> there flouriſh'd a great Wit, who not only baffled the whole Myſtery of Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a learned Philoſophical Treatiſe, but alſo publiſh'd an extraordinary Book concerning the Nature of the Gods, which alone, ſays Mr <hi>Harrington,</hi> in his preliminaries to his <hi>Oceana,</hi> was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to overthrow the Religion of the <hi>Roman</hi> State. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> contriv'd and effected himſelf the very Crime, for which he declaim'd againſt <hi>Cataline</hi> with ſo much vehemence, and undermin'd the moſt ſolid foundations of the Temples of the <hi>Roman</hi> Gods.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſophers began to eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>Pompey</hi> had ſubdu'd, began every day to reſort more and more to the World's Capitol. The <hi>Romans,</hi> thro an exceſs of ridiculous flattery, deify'd their deceas'd
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0391600400:142"/>
Emperors, which alone was enough to make the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion ridiculous; and Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to introduce a new Revelation. What was the effect of all this upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion? A Superſtition that had made ſuch impreſſions on the minds of that people, and from which they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that they and their Anceſtors had receiv'd ſo much benefit, could not be utterly overthrown in a moment. The <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo very pertinacious in their Principles, and had ſo much flegm and conſtancy in their conſtitutions, that the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſophy, and the Doctrine of <hi>Cicero,</hi> requir'd ſome time to prevail. However, prevail they did; and with them the Chriſtian Religion got ground, and the Pagan declin'd; and the Superſtition and Poetry of the <hi>Romans</hi> gradually declin'd together. And the Declenſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was attributed even by <hi>Petronius</hi> himſelf, who was a thorough-pac'd Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean, to the neglect of the old Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XV. Objections anſwer'd. Concluſion of the former part of the Work.</head>
                  <p>But here it concerns us to anſwer ſome Objections, which we eaſily foreſee may be made. For if the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which the <hi>Romans</hi> borrow'd from the <hi>Greeks</hi> had ſo great an influence on their Poetry, and the two Treatiſes which <hi>Cicero</hi> writ concerning Divination and the Nature of the Gods, gave ſuch a ſhock to that Superſtition; How comes it to paſs that Poetry not only flouriſh'd afterwards, but came to perfection in <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> which two were the greateſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which we ſhall endeavour to ſhow as ſuccinctly as we can, why Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try flouriſh'd after the publication of thoſe Treatiſes, and why it afterwards came to perfection. To ſatisfie the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why Poetry flouriſh'd afterwards, we need only repeat what we obſerv'd
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0391600400:144"/>
above, that the flegm and ſolidity of the <hi>Roman</hi> people, and perhaps their Politicks, ſuſpended the effect of thoſe Writings, and of the Doctrine of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſophers; and when they began to ſpread, it is reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they went downwards from the <hi>Patricians</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights to the people, who in all probability were the laſt who were undeceiv'd. Now the greateſt of their Poets, and eſpecially <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> flouriſh'd within leſs than fifty years after the publication of thoſe Treaties, and were moſt of them very meanly deſcended. So that they were brought up in the Religion of their Country, and had conſequently when they came to write, the advantage of firſt Impreſſions, and their copying the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poetry, threw them upon the old Idea's. 'Tis true, ſome few of them were better deſcended, and were <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, but either they were too much Men of Pleaſure, to dive into Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or too much Poets, to eſpouſe a Sect that would not favour Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm.</p>
                  <p>But now let us enquire with the ſame brevity, for what reaſon Poetry, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0391600400:145"/>
its preheminence from Religion, came to perfection among the <hi>Romans,</hi> after theſe attacks had been given to the Religion of that State: In anſwer to which, we muſt put the Reader in mind, that there are three things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the perfection of Poetry. The firſt is Nature, which is the foundation and baſis of all. For Nature is the ſame thing with Genius, and Genius and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are all one. For Paſſion in a Poem is Genius, and the power of exciting Paſſion is Genius in a Poet; to the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of which, Religion, as we have ſhewn above, gives a very great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The ſecond thing is Art, by which I mean thoſe Rules, and that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which capacitate us to manage every thing with the utmoſt dexterity, that may contribute to the Raiſing of Paſſion. The third thing is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which the Poet makes his Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or the Language in which he writes. By Language I do not mean here the expreſſion of any particular Poem, or the poetical Dialect which the Poet models himſelf; but the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Country in which he writes, and which he finds made to his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0391600400:146"/>
hands. Theſe are the three things that contribute to the perfection of Poetry; ſo that in any Age or Country, at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever juncture Religion and Language and Poetical Art are in greateſt force together, at that very juncture the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of that Country is at its heighth. And this is the reaſon why Tragedy, which is a Poem of the growth of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> was at its height in the time of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles,</hi> becauſe then the Language was in perfection; the Art of Poetry, and particularly of Tragedy, had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely cultivated, and Religion as yet had power enough o're the minds of men to inforce the paſſions. But the greateſt of theſe three is Religion, and the moſt prevalent towards the advancement of Poetry, as is plainly ſeen by the event. For, after that the Introduction of Moral Philoſophy had ruin'd the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Religion among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> Tragedy immediately loſt its force, tho the language remain'd in perfection af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and the Poetick Art was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps improv'd. Let us now examine how the Art of Poetry, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Language and the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion ſtood in the time of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> The Art of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0391600400:147"/>
Poetry, which had been introduc'd by <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> had now been culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated for about two hundred years, but with a great deal of Interruption, caus'd by the violences of thoſe times; and that it was at its utmoſt height in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> we have no great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt, becauſe we find more of the Poetical Art in the ſingle <hi>Aeneis</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> than in all the reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets together. For the Language, that it was then at its height, is agreed on by moſt; and tho ſome few may contend that it was ſomewhat declin'd from the purity which it had in the preceding age, yet it was certainly more Poetical in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that is, more full, more ſounding, more ſignificant, and more harmonious. And as for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we have already ſhewn that the effect of the Writings of <hi>Cicero</hi> was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by the flegmatick temper which was incapable of ſudden Impreſſions, and perhaps by the politicks of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> But that was not all. Religion had then more Force, more Authority and more Majeſty, than it had had for ſome time before; and that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Emperor. No one can be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0391600400:148"/>
ignorant what influence the example of a Prince has upon the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was in his temper Religious even to Superſtition. And tho during the violences of the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate, his Politicks had got the better of Nature in him, yet aſſoon as he had attain'd the Soveraign Power, Policy and Nature were reconcil'd, and both of them favour'd Religion; whereas the Age preceding had been an Age of continual Violences, and conſequently not of ſo much Religion. The <hi>Roman</hi> Senate having got the Lands from the People had conſequently got the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo that that famous Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was dwindled into an Oligarchy, and that Oligarchy was grown factious, as all Oligarchies muſt of neceſſity do; and the heads of thoſe Factions were all of them labouring who ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the State; ſo that they who were at the Helm of the State, neither were nor could appear good, becauſe there was a neceſſity of their giving pernicious Examples. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his natural clemency, and his proneneſs to Superſtition, was drawn in by Ambition to the committing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0391600400:149"/>
of violences in the beginning of the Triumvirate, and neither did nor durſt appear what he was, till dividing the World between himſelf and <hi>Anthony,</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and Nature were reconcil'd in him, and he was oblig'd to appear rather more Debonaire and Religious than he was by his Natural Temper, that the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of <hi>Anthony</hi> appearing more hideous, compar'd with the Beauty of his Character, he might inſenſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine his Rival in the eſteem of the Senate and the <hi>Roman</hi> people, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone command the Univerſe; and we may judge by this, what influence the Example of the Emperor had upon the Writers, that it not only prevail'd upon <hi>Virgil</hi> to make Piety one of the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in the Character of his Hero; who was deſign'd by the Poet the very Picture of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> but engag'd him to incorporate ſo much Religion with the Action of his Poem, that it is the moſt Religious Epick Poem that ever was writ in the World.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have endeavour'd to ſhew as briefly as we could, that Art and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Religion were all of them in a great deal of force together in the glorious
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0391600400:150"/>
Reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and much more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully united than ever they had been before, and I hope I need not tell the Reader than ever they were in the Reigns of ſucceeding Emperors. And in ſhewing that, I have given the reaſons why the <hi>Roman</hi> Poetry was then at its utmoſt height, tho I make no doubt but that a ſettled calm and a full tranquility, after a fierce and a tedious Tempeſt; and the elevation that might ſpring from the Remains and the Appearances of Liberty, and conſequently the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of their being Maſters of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and laſtly, the never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten bounty of a magnanimous Prince, and the Emulation that muſt enſue upon it among ſo many extraordinary men, might all of them contribute to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Poetry.</p>
                  <p>But if the Writings that flouriſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and eſpecially in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> receiv'd ſuch advantage from the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and greatneſs of their Poetry is chiefly owing to that, how comes it that <hi>Virgil</hi> is found in his Writings to have had ſo exalted a notion of God, as is utterly inconſiſtent with the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0391600400:151"/>
Theology? How comes it to paſs, that <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> are held to be thorough-pac'd <hi>Epicureans,</hi> on whom the Superſtition that reign'd among their Country-men could have no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of influence, and yet <hi>Horace</hi> allow'd to be after <hi>Virgil</hi> the greateſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, and <hi>Lucretius,</hi> as <hi>Taſſo</hi> is pleas'd to call him, a moſt Noble Verſifyer.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed, <hi>Virgil</hi> had an exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed notion of God, as we may ſee by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places in his works,</p>

is certain that he was educated in the Religion of his Country, as we obſerv'd above, and we know that the force of firſt impreſſions is great, and the copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poetry threw him upon thoſe firſt Ideas.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>And then this very <hi>Horace,</hi> whom ſome of the Moderns will ſo obſtinately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be a conſtant <hi>Epicurean</hi>; this very perſon, who, as he was the ſecond of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, was one of their greateſt Criticks, declares himſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of our opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Roman</hi> Poetry deriv'd its preheminence from the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; for in his Satyrs, wherein he aſſures us he is no Poet, he intermingles none but Burleſque Religion, and that very rarely, with his Verſes; in his Odes, where he knew that he was a Poet, Religion is every where ſeen, and Invocations, Apoſtrophes, Machines and Revelations abound in them.</p>
                  <p>But now a word or two to <hi>Lucretius.</hi> He writ before the publication of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0391600400:157"/>
Treatiſes, but then he was undeniably an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> and writ with a deſign to draw others over to his Sect. But in that very Poem, which he writ with a Deſign to overthrow Religion, he ſhews of what importance Religion was to Poetry; and the very Treatiſe which he begins with a Deſign to overturn the Worſhip of the Gods, that very Treatiſe he begins with the Invocation of a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs. And that Invocation is undeniably one of the nobleſt and moſt Poetical parts of his Book: So that <hi>Lucretius,</hi> to attain an excellence in Poetry, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be guilty of a very ſtrange ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in Philoſophy. For, to what purpoſe does he Invoke the Goddeſs of Love? Why he Invokes her to inform him that he ought not to Invoke her, for that ſhe does not hear him, and does not regard him, and has nothing at all to do with him.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>For, let no one tell me here, that by <hi>Venus</hi> the Poet means only the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0391600400:158"/>
Faculty of things. In ſhort, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> Invokes ſomething, and Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Adoration, and whatever is ador'd, muſt during the action by the Adorer be eſteem'd a Deity.</p>
                  <p>But it is not only in his Invocation that <hi>Lucretius</hi> is pleas'd to have recourſe to Religion. For after that, in the two firſt Books he has been taking a great deal of pains to deſtroy the belief of Gods and Providence, that in his third he may be very Poetical and very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, he is forc'd to erect a new Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the room of thoſe whom he has been juſt ſubverting; And that is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; tho by what he makes her ſay in that Noble <hi>Proſopopaeia,</hi> we might very well miſtake her for Providence.</p>
                  <p>So that we have not only the opinion of <hi>Lucretius</hi> on our ſide, but the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple too. For, by having recourſe to Religion in that very Philoſophy that utterly diſclaims it, he not only declares of what Importance he thinks it to be to Poetry, but has ſhewn of what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it really is, by ſucceeding ſo much better in thoſe paſſages than in the other parts of his Book. But how could a Materialiſt, the Reader may ſay, draw
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0391600400:159"/>
any advantage from Religion? But <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> was made, not born a Materialiſt. He was bred in the Religion of his Country, and ſo had the advantage of, firſt impreſſions which are never to be defac'd, <hi>Lucretius,</hi> you may ſay, perhaps was very lofty and very Poetical where he had nothing to do with Religion. Indeed ſometimes he was ſo, for I do not remember that I affirmed that there can be no Poetry without Religion, but only that Religion gives the occaſion for the beſt, the greateſt and the moſt Exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it makes for my purpoſe ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Lucretius</hi> is moſt Poetical and and Sublime where he is Religious. But where he is lofty in other places, we find him deſcribing the great <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, and the higher a man riſes and the nearer he comes to the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite cauſe, the nearer he certainly comes to Religion. Beſides, where <hi>Lucretius</hi> is lofty and Poetical in Deſcribing the great <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of of Nature, there we are ſure to find him aſtoniſh'd for from whence comes his vehemence but from his aſtoniſhment, which may give us a Suſpicion, that <hi>Lucretius</hi> was not ſo very aſſured of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0391600400:160"/>
truth of his opinion. For effects aſtoniſh no man. He who is aſtoniſh'd is moved by the ſecret cauſes of things which are two high or too deep for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. So that in places where there is no mention of Religion, <hi>Lucretius</hi> in ſome meaſure derives from that his Impetuous Golden Torrent of Verſe, his vehemence and his Sublimity.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have inquired into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Ancients, with all imaginable Impartiality, and have attempted to ſhew that they had the advantage of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns in the greatneſs of Poetry, but that they deriv'd it not from any Superiority of Faculties, or any external or internal advantage, abſtracted from the nature of the ſubjects of which they treated, but only from incorporating Poetry with Religion.</p>

both Parties being reconcil'd and united in the common opinion, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, tho they are exalted above us, are not beyond our reach, may immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately take fire, and contending with a Noble Emulation, puſh on the Art to ſome degrees of perfection, beyond what it has attain'd for theſe laſt fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.

                  <p>But here it concerns us to anſwer an Objection.

                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall enquire into the Reaſon of the thing, and I make no doubt but to make it appear, that the nearer Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try comes to Perfection, the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable it is to the deſign of the true Religion, and that conſequently Poetry is much more noble and more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and more beneficial to Mankind than either Hiſtory or Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>In order to the doing which, let us examine what the deſign is of the true Religion, and we ſhall find that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the deſign of Poetry is the very ſame, but the very methods of attaining that deſign the ſame, as far as they can be humanely proſecuted; tho at the ſame time it muſt be confeſt, that Poetry, tho

the nobleſt of all Arts, and preferable either to Hiſtory or Philoſophy, falls as ſhort of the Excellence of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as Human Invention does of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>The deſign of every Religion muſt be the Happineſs of thoſe who embrace it. Impoſtors, and all who ſet up new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions for ſome politick ends, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pretend this, or they will have no followers; for all men propound Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to themſelves in every thing that they do; and the Reaſon why ſo few men are throughly and entirely of any Religion, is, becauſe they are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently convinc'd that it will make them happy. But as even falſe Religions muſt pretend to make thoſe who profeſs them happy, ſo the true one muſt real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effect it: For the true Religion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is innate or reveal'd, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come from God, and muſt be given by him as a Rule and a Law for thoſe who embrace it to walk by.

But God muſt be good, and conſequently cannot make Laws, only becauſe it is

his Arbitrary will; no, he muſt make them, becauſe he who beſt knows the nature of his own Creatures, knows that they will find their Happineſs in being conformable to them. But if the deſign of all Religion muſt be to make men happy, why then that muſt be the true Religion that makes men the moſt happy: And conſequently that muſt be the true Religion that has the Simpleſt Deſign, and the ſhorteſt and the ſureſt. For the deſign of the true Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make men happy, it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be of ſuch a nature, as that all may be capable of it. For if a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of which none but men of ſenſe were capable, ſhould be the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it would follow, that God had made moſt men Blockheads, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made them wretched for being ſo. But now let us examine what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that is, that takes the ſhorteſt and the ſureſt, and moſt admirable method for making thoſe who embrace it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
                  <p>Since the deſign of all Religion muſt be to make men happy, and the only true Religion can effect that deſign, which all others in vain pretend to, becauſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0391600400:168"/>
only the true Religion can come from God, who alone underſtands our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and alone knows that which the moſt will pleaſe us, it follows, that all who are not really of the true Religion, cannot be perfectly happy. Now this is certain, that Mankind has in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and in all Ages, in all Places and at all Times, complain'd of the want of Happineſs. Both Ancients and Moderns, Philoſophers and the People, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that Man was miſerable. And this univerſal conſent may be ſufficient to ſhew, that the miſery of Man is real, and not imaginary; beſides, they have all, both Ancients and Moderns, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Poets, Men of Senſe, and the Vulgar, admirably agreed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing it. They have all conſented in this, that the miſery of Man proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a perpetual conflict that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and from a diſcord continually reigning among the faculties of the Soul; a cruel War between the Paſſion, and Senſes, and the Reaſon, while the Reaſon violently draws one way, and the Paſſions and the Senſes another; the latter endeavouring ſtill to be pleas'd by getting the upper hand of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0391600400:169"/>
and the former contending to be ſatisfied by ſubduing the latter, while neither party can gain an entire victory, but an eternal conflict remains; for tho the frequent advantages are on the ſide of the Paſſions, yet Reaſon rallies from time to time, and maintains a running fight.</p>

                  <p>Thus has St <hi>Paul</hi> given a lively De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the conflict that is in the Human Soul between Paſſion and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe he very well knew the cauſe of it. The Philoſophers felt the effect, and could deſcribe it tolerably well; but being wholly ignorant of the cauſe, they took that to be a Defect in Nature, which is really an infectious Diſtemper; and here lay the folly of thoſe people, in believing that they were capable of altering Nature; which puts me in mind of an Aſtrological King of <hi>Naples,</hi> who not being very well pleas'd with what he thought the Syſtem and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the Univerſe, ſaid that if God when he made the World would have vouchſaf'd to have conſulted him, he could have given him very good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. For, ſo by their Writings the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſeem to have been of opinion,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0391600400:172"/>
that whereas God had made Man Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they could make him Good, and whereas he had made him a Blockhead, they could make him Wiſe.</p>
                  <p>But the Philoſophers not knowing the cauſe of the miſery of Man, made very ſucceſsleſs attempts towards the making us happy; for whether they ſupported the Reaſon againſt the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all that they gain'd was to inflame the contention which they deſign'd to extinguiſh; and by rouſing and exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Parties make that War be carried on with vehemence, which perhaps was in a languiſhing ſtate before; or whither they animated the Paſſions againſt the Reaſon, they could only mortifie what they could never vanquiſh.</p>
                  <p>Thus, whither they endeavour'd to live up to the Dictates of Reaſon, the Paſſions plagu'd them by a very violent reſiſtance; or whether they endeavour'd to plunge themſelves in ſenſual pleaſure, they could no further oppreſs the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than they ſtupified the whole Man; and Remorſe at laſt, like the Dragon that watch'd the <hi>Heſperian</hi> fruit, was never to be laid aſleep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0391600400:173"/>
But tho the Philoſophers ſeem'd wholly in the dark, the Poets appear'd to have a glimmering of the Truth, as we may conclude from the Fable of <hi>Pandora</hi> and <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> whether they had it from old Tradition, or from a Noble Effort of Reaſon. For, ſays Mr <hi>Mede,</hi> If there were no Scripture, yet the unſampled Irregularity of our whole Nature, which all the time of our life runs counter to all Order and Right Reaſon, the woful miſery of our condition being a ſcene of ſorrow, without any reſt or contentment, this might breed ſome general ſuſpicion, that <hi>ab initio non fuit ita,</hi> but that he who made us Lords of his Creatures, made us not ſo worthleſs and vile as now we are, but that ſome common Father to us all, had drank ſome ſtrange and Deviliſh Poyſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the whole Race was infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus far goes Mr <hi>Mede,</hi> and I will make bold to add, by the leave of the Clergy, that this Suſpicion might very well grow up to Reaſon and Certainty, tho' there were no Scripture. For that Man is miſerable, experience aſſures us; but ſince Man is a Creature capable of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0391600400:174"/>
Happineſs, and one who knows his miſery, Reaſon may tell us that Man could never be Created miſerable, for that would have been contrary to the goodneſs of God, which is his Darling Attribute. Since God might as well Damn his Creatures for nothing, as he might Create them miſerable. Man therefore was certainly created happy, and happy had he continued till now, if it had not been for his own fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had been repugnant to the Juſtice of God, to puniſh Man for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Thus far we may conclude then by the force of Reaſon, that Man has committed ſome horrible crime, the which has made him miſerable.</p>
                  <p>But tho' the ſtrength of Reaſon may reach thus far, yet it could never inform Man of the Nature of the crime, the committing of which has made him miſerable, nor in what his original Happineſs conſiſted. All that that we can gueſs by Reaſon is this, that ſince the miſery of Man at preſent lyes in the conflict that he has within himſelf, and in the Civil War which is maintaind in his faculties, that his original Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſted in the Peace and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0391600400:175"/>
and the Harmony that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and that the Crime that cauſed his unhappineſs, was in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood ſomething that naturally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily broke that Harmony and that Agreement. And that we may ſee how far theſe conjectures agree with what our Religion ſays of it, let us make ſome enquiry into the account which Sacred Writ has given of it.</p>
                  <p>That tells us, that man was not in the beginning what he is at preſent. That he was created Holy, Innocent, Perfect. That his Creator fill'd him with the brightneſs of Knowledge, and with a luminous lively Intelligence. That he then had a ſtrict dependence on his Maker. That he communicated the wonders of his Glory to him. That the Eye of Man then ſaw the Majeſty of God; and that this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo miſerable now, was then moſt entirely happy. That he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded, untroubled, impained, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſive, immortal. This is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that our Religion gives us of the primitive ſtate of Man. It tells us, how great his Knowledge was,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0391600400:176"/>
his Happineſs and his Perfection. Let us now ſee how much his Paſſions and his Sences were able to contribute to ſo much Felicity.</p>
                  <p>That Man in his Original State had Paſſions and great Paſſions, is certain. For without Paſſion there can be no Happineſs, becauſe there can be no Pleaſure. Beſides, it muſt be by a great Paſſion, or by great Paſſions that the firſt Man muſt fall. For by the weakneſs of his Reaſon he could not be loſt: For if he had not had Reaſon enough to know that he ought not to have committed the tranſgreſſion which ruin'd him, why then the ruin of Man had not been his own fault. Man therefore before the Fall had Paſſions, but being in a ſtate of Perfect Felicity, he could conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſubject to no Paſſions, which were not entirely conſiſtent with that. He walked with God, and was then united to him, becauſe the Creator was pleaſed to communicate himſelf in ſo great a degree to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Man therefore conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0391600400:177"/>
God, not ſo much by the force of Reaſon as of Intuition, or a luminous lively Intelligence. God acted upon his mind, and he felt him as well as ſaw him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Admir'd, Lov'd, Deſir'd, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd him, and the reſult of theſe charming Paſſions was a Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable. For the more they were exalted, the more his Reaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of them; and ſince it knew that he could never ſuffer by them in that ſtate of Happineſs and of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, it eternally exhorted him to perpetuate them, and told him that they could never be too high for their Glorious Object. So that man in his primitive State was always in lofty raviſhing Tranſports. For Love, Admiration, Joy and Deſire, thoſe charming Paſſions were all that he knew, of which Bliſsful Love was always the chief. For God making Man a ſociable Creature, gave him ſuch a ſort of a Happineſs, as that the Felicity of one might produce that of another; and what could that be but an habitual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or loving God and Man for the ſake of God. Our bliſsful Sire enjoy'd
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0391600400:178"/>
a ſincere felicity, and conſequently could never know any trouble, nor any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that had a mixture of trouble, as anger, ſorrow, fear, and the like. Much leſs could Ambition find room in his breaſt, with Envy, Hatred, Pride, and Revenge, and the reſt of thoſe Turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions that are utterly inconſiſtent with Charity.</p>
                  <p>And as his paſſions were always pleaſing, ſo his ſenſes were never ſhock'd: The happy creature converſt with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſaw the Majeſty of his Maker. And for the Terreſtrial Objects which were around him, and which were all ſubjected to his univerſal Empire, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſurvey'd them, like his Creator, he found that they were always good; and as the Creatures never were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, he was never Diſpleas'd with them. For, as he had neither fear nor knowledge of ſuffering, Antipathy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Horrour, and the like, were things that he never knew, which in this woful ſtate of miſery, are ſo often Nature's ſecret Intelligencers, to adviſe us of approaching harm. Thus all the Faculties were always pleas'd, and man was bleſs'd unſpeakably.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0391600400:179"/>
But the reſult of this perfect Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, was not only continual Happineſs, but unclouded Knowledge and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. For, as from the Agreement of the vital Faculties, and their concord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motions, Spirit and Health and pleaſant Eaſe, and vigour of Senſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; ſo from the Harmony of the Rational and Animal powers proceeded a luminous lively Intelligence, and a bliſsful Immortality. For pleaſure was the reſult of that Agreement, and ſince Death can only come by pain, he who is in a ſtate of perpetual pleaſure, muſt by conſequence be Immortal.</p>
                  <p>But Man alas was unable to ſupport ſo much Happineſs without Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He form'd the Deſign of growing Independant, of ſhaking off the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him who made him, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his felicity apart from God. This made him conceive the Horrible Crime, of Diverting his affections from him who alone was worthy of them; to things that were form'd ſo many degrees inferiour to him: and that which made the unpardonable enormity of that crime was this, that when God had created him with an ardent deſire of Happineſs,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0391600400:180"/>
and had created him of ſuch a nature, that his full and his perfect Happineſs lay in his ſtrict dependance on him, and had given him a clear underſtanding to know this; that, I ſay, made the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable enormity of his Crime, that, contrary to this Nature, and this Deſire, and this unclouded Knowledge, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted and fell off from God, and by the ſuggeſtion of his greateſt enemy, tax'd him at once with folly and envy, in believing himſelf capable of finding and enjoying a greater felicity than what his Maker deſign'd for him. And thus Mans fatal Original Sin, whether the buſineſs of the Tree of Knowledge is Literal or Allegorical, conſiſted in his horribly diverting his affections from his God to the Creatures. And thus the Harmony of his Intellectual and Animal powers was very miſerably broke. For Reaſon diſapprov'd of the unworthy objects that Man had choſen for his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the Paſſions being natural and congenial to the Soul, could not be idle, and Man could not reduce them to their primitive object. For God had abandon'd him to himſelf, and how ſhould Man of himſelf approach Infinity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0391600400:181"/>
And now the bliſsful Time was no more, when Man was only touch'd with tranſporting Paſſions. And now the force of thoſe Charming Paſſions was continually curb'd by Reaſon, which utterly diſapprov'd of their objects; and a thouſand vexatious ones ſprung up among them, like cockle to choak the vital ſeed, and which were partly the reſult of preſent miſery, and partly of paſt felicity.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Sences partook of the ſame Diſorder that had ſeiz'd the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and they that during his ſtate of Innocence, were always pleas'd with the approbation of Reaſon, and were ne're Diſturb'd, now either betray'd him to Concupiſcence, or were ſhock'd at their ſeveral objects. His Eye and his Ear, thoſe noble miniſters of the Underſtanding, were no longer charm'd with the voice of God, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of Angels; and were either too much engag'd by the Terreſtrial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects around them, or diſturb'd in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of Reaſon. The Creatures whom God had furniſh'd with inſtinct ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the care of their preſervation, in their Degenerate Monarch beheld
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0391600400:182"/>
their Enemy. They gladly obey'd him during his Innocence, as Loyal Subjects do a good King, but when he grew wicked he grew a Tyrant, and they at the ſame time turn'd Rebels. From hence Averſions, Horrors, Antipathies, and Fear and Hate and Rage ſprung up in them; and Man was got into a ſtate of War with all the inferiour Creatures, who of his Humble Vaſſals before, were now his Potent Enemies. Both Parties were on their Guard inceſſantly, always dreaded, and always terrify'd.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Harmony of the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual and Animal powers was diſſolv'd by Original Sin. And the Ignorance of this, caus'd all the blunders of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. They knew very well, that the Combat between the Reaſon and Paſſions caus'd the miſery of Man, but they never dreamt of reconciling the difference, becauſe alas they never thought that the parties had once been friends. All that they aim'd at, was to put an end to the conflict, by deſtroying one of the parties, and ſo ſome of them thought of ſtifling the Reaſon, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of ſuppreſſing the Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0391600400:183"/>
But the folly of theſe two Deſigns was equally great, becauſe they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts at things that are equally Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. For as long as Man is Man he muſt have Reaſon, and as long as there is Reaſon there will be Remorſe, which will rally from time to time, and be a check upon the exorbitance of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And tho Remorſe could be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely extinguiſh'd, as I believe it never can, yet Reaſon would be ſure to make its Declaration another way, and that is by our inconſtancy in pleaſure, and our want of variety.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the folly leſs of endeavouring to ſuppreſs the Paſſions, for either they muſt be wholly ſuppreſs'd or reſtrain'd; But all the Paſſions being natural, in the condition in which Man is now, none of them can be wholly ſuppreſs'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſtroying the Man, nor can ſome of them be ſo much as moderated, without maintaining conſtantly in the ſoul a very violent conflict, becauſe they were perfectly unreſtrain'd in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Natures.</p>
                  <p>The Paſſions are either natural and congeneal to the Soul, or accidental: Theſe firſt are thoſe which are pleaſing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0391600400:184"/>
to it, as Love, Joy, Deſire, and with theſe the firſt Man was created, for Man was created Happy; but without theſe Paſſions there can be no Happineſs. The accidental Paſſions, as Anger, Envy, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and Deſire of Revenge, are thoſe with which Man at the firſt was not created, for they all include Miſery, and he was created Happy. They were all the reſult of the fall, which brought woe to the Race of Men. Man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed capable of reſtraining theſe laſt, becauſe they all of them include Miſery, and he retaining a vehement deſire of Happineſs, tho joyn'd to an impotence of attaining it, is by that very Deſire capacitated to ſtruggle with apparent Miſery. But it muſt needs be a hard contention when we pretend to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the firſt, becauſe there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within us that ſecretly tells us they are neceſſary to our Happineſs; and the conflict muſt needs be violent, when we ſtrive againſt our own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Beſides, they are as natural to the Soul as Reaſoning, and the reſult of that; and a Reaſonable Creature can no more be without Admiration, Love and Deſire, than it can be without Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0391600400:185"/>
or without the appetites of Sence; and a Man can no more ſuppreſs the one by Philoſophy than the other. He can no more take away Love and Deſire by Reaſoning, than he can ſatisfie Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt with a Syllogiſm. All that he can arrive at, is either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal thoſe Paſſions, as he may do his Appetites, or to refuſe to act in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of them, as he may in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Thinking, or of Senſual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. Or laſtly, He may weaken theſe congeneal Paſſions by Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he may do his Appetites or his Reaſon. For a Diſtemper weakens the whole Man, and Mortification is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in effect at leaſt. But when the man is in health, and his Sences vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and his Reaſon piercing, theſe Appetites too will be ſtrong. And the more powerful the Reaſon is, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be the Paſſions: And therefore the attempt to ſuppreſs theſe was folly in the Philoſophers. For theſe Paſſions are the pleaſure of the Soul, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtruggle with ſucceſs againſt felicity. The cauſe of their miſtake was this; Some of them, as for example, the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks,</hi> thought that Reaſon diſapprov'd
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0391600400:186"/>
of the Paſſions, when ſhe only diſlik'd the Objects; whereas the <hi>Cyrenaicks</hi> on the other hand thought that Humane Nature allow'd of the Objects, when it did nothing but approve of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>And this may ſerve to ſhew the folly of Deiſm as well as it may of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. For Deiſm pretending, like Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, to combat all the Paſſions, muſt be founded on the ſtrength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But a Religion founded on the ſtrength of Reaſon, cannot be the true Religion. For the true Religion muſt be ſent from God, for the Happineſs of Mankind, and of that Religion all muſt be capable, as we have ſhown above. But of a Religion founded on the ſtrength of Reaſon, and whoſe proofs muſt of conſequence be deduc'd from a long train of conſequences, all men are not capable, for every Religion muſt have proofs, and all men are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the proofs of ſuch a Religion as that. As for example: before a man can be a Deiſt effectually, he muſt be convinc'd of the being of a God by Reaſon, and muſt be convinc'd by the ſame Reaſon that the World is govern'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0391600400:187"/>
by God. But to be capable of the proofs that Deiſm gives of thoſe two points, a man muſt either have a very ſtrong Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or a very good education, whereas not ſo much as one in forty of Mankind has either. But all are capable of the proofs of Revealed Religion: For by proving the Divinity of the Revelation, the Doctrine is proved in courſe. Now the Divinity of the Revelation muſt be prov'd by Miracles. But Miracles are proofs of which all men are capable, becauſe they ſpeak to the Paſſions and appeal to the Sences. Since therefore the true Religion muſt be deſign'd for all; and all men are capable of the proofs of Reveal'd Religion, whereas not one in forty is capable of the proofs of Deiſm, it follows that a Religion that is not Reveal'd cannot be the True Religion.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, no Religion can be the True Religion that is inſufficient to anſwer the ends of Government. But a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that is not deſign'd for all, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver anſwer the ends of Government. And therefore Deiſm cannot be the True Religion. For there are but two things that can reſtrain mankind, and keep
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0391600400:188"/>
them within the power of Law; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſenſe enough to know their real Intereſt. But we have already made it appear above, that whoever wants good ſenſe cannot be reſtrain'd by Deiſm.</p>
                  <p>That Deiſm is inſufficient to anſwer the ends of Government, may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plain from matter of fact; for it would be an eaſie thing to convince the Reader that there never was any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Government in the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Reveal'd Religion; and that the Governments that have been moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd upon Earth, flouriſh'd with their reſpective Revelations, and with them decay'd, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did with their Prophets, the <hi>Grecians</hi> with their Oracles, and the <hi>Romans</hi> with their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations; ſo that either the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can be in the World without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and without peace, or Deiſm can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be the True Religion.</p>
                  <p>Again, either that can be the True Religion, which can contribute nothing even to the Happineſs of thoſe who embrace it, or Deiſm cannot be the True Religion. For Deiſm contributes nothing at all to the Happineſs even of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0391600400:189"/>
thoſe who are capable of it, becauſe that by combating and reſiſting the Paſſions, it maintains the War of the Faculties, inſtead of appeaſing it.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſhewn that the Deſign of the True Religion muſt not only be to make men Happy, but muſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually do it; that the Philoſophers indeed had that Deſign, but blunder'd in the execution of it; and by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either to ſet up our Paſſions above our Reaſon, or our Reaſon above our Paſſions, only maintain'd an eternal conflict in the breaſts they deſign'd to eaſe; that the Deiſt does the very ſame thing, by his endeavours to exalt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by depreſſing the Paſſions. Let us now ſhew how the Chriſtian Religion exalts our Reaſon by exalting the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by a plain and a ſhort, but a moſt admirable Deſign, reſtores the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Human Faculties, and the Felicity of the firſt man.</p>
                  <p>For, after that Chriſtianity has gain'd its profeſſors, by proving after the moſt plain and ſimple manner all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believ'd in it; that is, by Miracles atteſted by unexceptionable Witneſſes, it gains its end, which is the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0391600400:190"/>
Happineſs of its believers, in ſo plain, ſo ſure, and ſo ſhort a way, that the way to Happineſs and the end is but one and the ſame thing, and differs only in Degree. <hi>Set your affections on things above, and not on things below,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 2. That is, Do but earneſtly deſire of God to incline your affections to him, their primitive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; Do but deſire it, and he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them, and the great buſineſs of Religion is done, the Harmony of the Human Faculties reſtor'd, and the Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the firſt man in ſome meaſure at leaſt renew'd. Nay, the way is ſhorter and plainer even than this. For, Do but earneſtly deſire of God to give you Charity, and he will give it, and with that give every Virtue. For, to ſhew how plain, how ſhort, how admirable, the Deſign is of this Divine Religion, Love, which is but a ſingle Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the moſt pleaſing of all the Paſſions, comprehends all its Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and all its Felicity. St <hi>Paul</hi> has given an admirable reaſon why it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all its Duties; for Love, ſays he, worketh no ill to his Neighbour, and is therefore the fulfilling of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0391600400:191"/>
Law. And that it is incluſive of all its Felicity, may be concluded from hence, that Charity gently reſtraining thoſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Paſſions which diſturb and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the mind, exalts all the pleaſing affections which are natural and conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal to the Soul, and exalts the very Reaſon of Mankind, by exalting thoſe charming Paſſions. For Reaſon being troubled no more in its Functions, by the painful conflict which it maintain'd before, is free to diſcern and diſtinguiſh Divine Truth, and now employs the exten and ſtretch of its power, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and augmenting the force of thoſe aſpiring Paſſions, which, while they were directed to mortal objects, it eſteem'd its mortal Enemies. And as the Reaſon rouzes and excites the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Paſſions, as it were in a fiery vehicle, tranſport the Reaſon above Mortality, which mounting, ſoars to the Heaven of Heavens, upon the wings of thoſe very affections that before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd the Noble Efforts that it made to aſcend the Skies.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſeen how the Chriſtian Religion reconciles Paſſion to Reaſon. And while the troubleſome
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0391600400:192"/>
Virtues of Deiſts and old Philoſophers, are employ'd in reſtraining thoſe charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſions, which are ſo natural to the Soul of man, and which, rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, conſtitute all its Felicity, the Cardinal Virtues of the true Religion, as Faith, and Hope and Charity, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Paſſions themſelves. And as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity confirms and cheriſhes all the pleaſing affections, which are to the Soul, as ſo many delicious Friends, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dear Relations, the very converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which is ſufficient to make it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, it gently appeaſes the tumultuous Paſſions, accidental uneaſy gueſts that interrupt its pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>But the Chriſtian Religion reſtores the harmony of the Human Powers to a greater degree than this, and provides even a pleaſure of Sence that may be highly approv'd of by Reaſon. For though the Chriſtian in this life is not allowed to expect that in a Soveraign degree, yet, ſince there is no ſight ſo charming to the Eye, and no Muſick ſo harmonious to the Ear, as the voice and looks of thoſe whom we love, the Chriſtian Religion by commanding us, 1 Epiſt; of St <hi>Pet.</hi> ch. 1. v. 2. <hi>To love one</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0391600400:193"/>
                     <hi>another with a pure heart fervently,</hi> has provided in an admirable manner for the delight of thoſe noble Sences.</p>
                  <p>Thus the proofs ofChriſtianity are ſhort, and plain, and its Doctrine that leads to Felicity admirably ſhort and unperplex'd, whereas the proofs of Deiſm are abſtruſe, (I mean to the People they are abſtruſe,) and we have ſhewn that the true Religion muſt be deſigned for all, and the method that it takes to make us happy, tedious and vexatious. And this is extreamly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that the very morality which in Deiſm and in Philoſophy is prov'd, at the firſt perhaps with difficulty, and perhaps at the laſt obſcurely; and when it is prov'd, obey'd with pain, becauſe it ſhocks all the pleaſing Paſſions which ſo firmly inhere to the Soul, that very Morality in the Chriſtian Religion is clearly and eaſily prov'd to all, becauſe the Divinity of its Revelation is clearly and eaſily prov'd, and when it is prov'd is purſu'd with pleaſure, becauſe it is every part of it dictated by Love, the beſt and ſweeteſt of all the Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>And thus Chriſtianity performs in a moment, what Philoſophy and Deiſm have for Ages in vain attempted. For God can touch the Heart in a moment,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0391600400:194"/>
and a ſhort contrition makes way for a long felicity. And the wiſdom of God ſeems loudly to declare the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his great deſign, by the perſons whom he choſe to execute it. For had there been any thing perplex'd or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult in it, Men of Choice Education and great Parts, would have been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to expound it. But it was ſo eaſie, ſo clear, ſo agreeable to the Nature of Man, whether conſider'd as an Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or a Member of a vaſt Society, (for Charity, that makes the Happineſs of particulars, tends to the felicity of the whole community; and whereas Juſtice is ſatisfied with the reſtraining men from the doing harm, Charity, the moſt active and the beſt natur'd of all virtues, engages him to the doing good; and there can be no ſuch prevalent motive for the making any one happy, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love him) the deſign, I ſay, of this Holy Religion, is ſo agreeable to the nature of man, that God made choice of twelve poor Fiſhermen, or ſomething more vile to human regard than Fiſhermen, to propagate its Divine Doctrine. And to whom did they preach it? Not to Brutal Savages, as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0391600400:195"/>
                     <hi>Orpheus</hi> did his pretended Revelation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, nor to bloody Barbarians, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did his Fanatick Enthuſiaſm afterwards, but to the moſt civiliz'd and knowing Nations of the World, when Learning was at the greateſt heighth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; to the Provinces of the <hi>Leſſer Aſia,</hi> who were the moſt ſubtle people on the Earth; to <hi>Greece</hi> the great Inventreſs of Arts; and to <hi>Rome</hi> the Miſtreſs of Nations: to <hi>Rome,</hi> that with her victorious Armies, had even then, juſt then ſubdu'd and civiliz'd the barbarous World. And twelve poor ignorant contemptible Fiſhermen, who were diſpis'd by their own Nation, and whoſe Nation it ſelf was almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally deſpicable, in a very ſhort time eſtabliſh'd this Doctrine in the midſt of theſe knowing Nations; nay, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd it without Arts, without Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, without Reputation, without Power, and downright Innocence and Simplicity prevail'd o're the ſubtilty of the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> the vigorous lively pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the profound ſolidity of the <hi>Romans.</hi> So that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge bluſhing was inſtructed by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the vain efforts of all human
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0391600400:196"/>
Wiſdom ſtood confounded by the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of Preaching; And the Apoſtle had a great deal of reaſon to exeult in the firſt Ep. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 20, 21. Where is the Wiſe? Where is the <hi>Scribe</hi>? Where is the Diſputer of this World? Hath not God made fooliſh the Wiſdom of this World? For after that by the Wiſdom of God, the World by Wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching to ſave them that believe; and v. the 27th, <hi>ibid.</hi> God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this World to confound the Wiſdom of the Wiſe. So that this Religion, propagated under theſe ſtrange diſadvantages, by Ignorance againſt Philoſophy, by Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity againſt Arts and Eloquence, by Weakneſs againſt all the oppoſition of Power, by abject and contemptible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, againſt the noiſe and renown of Wiſdom, by men under poverty and perſecution, againſt all the Flatteries of Imperial Tyrants; this Divine Religion, embraced with danger, boaſted of in ſufferings, and taught in Martyrdom; this Religion, I ſay, thus wonderfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, muſt needs have had ſomething in the deſign of it, when it was but never
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0391600400:197"/>
ſo little attended to, that is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to the Nature of Man, and muſt be better adapted to make a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, compounded of Paſſions and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Happy, than either Power or Place, or Worldly Proſperity, or Fame, or Philoſophy, were before. But what could be ſo agreeable to the nature of a Creature compounded of the foreſaid Faculties, as that which reconciled thoſe Faculties which neither Fame nor Philoſophy, Riches nor Power could ever be found to do, or how could twelve poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fiſhermen, without education, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out parts, comprehend what the worlds great Sages could never find out, or how could they conſent againſt apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in making it known to the world, if they had not been inſtructed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to act by ſomething that was more than Human?</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſhewn, How that the Deſign of all Religion muſt be to make men Happy, but that the True Religion muſt not only deſign it, but muſt effectually do it. And then we proceeded to ſhew, that the miſery of man conſiſting in the conflict which is maintain'd within him, his Happineſs
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0391600400:198"/>
by conſequence muſt proceed from the Harmony which is in the Human Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; then we ſhew'd how that Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny came to be broke, and how it was afterwards by the Chriſtian Religion reſtored.</p>
                  <p>But now, as the end of every Religion muſt be the happineſs of thoſe who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, ſo the deſign of every Art muſt be the very ſame, as has been always acknowledged by all who have enquired into the Nature of Art in general, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deſigns of particular Arts. And as the true Religion muſt not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Happineſs of its Profeſſors, but muſt really effect it, and as that alone is the true Religion, which makes the beſt proviſion for the happineſs of thoſe who profeſs it; ſo that muſt be the beſt and the nobleſt Art which brings the greateſt Felicity with it. But as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of man proceeds from the diſcord and thoſe civil jars that are maintained within him, it follows that nothing can make him happy, but what can remove that diſcord, and reſtore the Harmony of the Human Faculties. So that that muſt be the beſt and the nobleſt Art, which makes the beſt Proviſion at the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0391600400:199"/>
ſame time for the ſatisfaction of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, the Reaſon, the Paſſions, the Sences. But none of them provides in ſuch a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign manner as Poetry, for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the whole man together. In ſome of them only Reaſon finds its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as in Logick and Mathematicks. In ſome of them only Reaſon and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in the Ancient Eloquence, and that by no means in a Soveraign degree, for ſometimes the Paſſions oppreſs the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſometimes Reaſon excludes the Paſſions. In others the Paſſions and the Sences are charm'd, while Reaſon finds little contentment in them. Thus Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick by its Harmony raiſes the Paſſions, at the ſame time that it pleaſes the Ear, and Painting by its touches moves the affections, at the ſame time that it charms the Eye. But in a ſublime and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Poem, the Reaſon and Paſſions and Sences are pleas'd at the ſame time ſuperlatively. The Reaſon in the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and importance of the Moral, and the greatneſs and juſtneſs of an Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious deſign, whoſe parts ſo beautiful, when they are conſidered ſeparately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tranſporting upon a view or the whole, while we are never weary of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0391600400:200"/>
contemplating their exact proportion and beautiful ſymetry, and their ſecret won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful dependance, while they are all animated by the ſame Spirit in order to the ſame end. The reaſon further finds its account, in the exact perpetual of Servance of Decorums, and in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf exalted by the exaltation of the Paſſions, and in ſeeing thoſe Paſſions in their fierceſt tranſports, confin'd to thoſe bounds, which that has ſeverely preſcrib'd them. That the Paſſions muſt find their account in Poetry, we have endeavour'd to prove in the former part of this Treatiſe, but we cannot forbear taking notice of this, that thoſe very Paſſions which plague and torment us in life, pleaſe us, nay, tranſport us in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. That the noble ſenſes find their account in an accompliſh'd Poem, no one who has read one, can a moment doubt. Nor <hi>Corelli</hi>'s Hand nor <hi>Syphace</hi>'s voice, could ever to a judicious ear equal the <hi>Virgilian</hi> Harmony: Which has all the Maſtery, with all the Air, and all the Sweetneſs, with all the Force, that the moſt delicate Ear can require. Tho all his Numbers are always perfect, yet he never dwells upon any; and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0391600400:201"/>
they which are in themſelves ſo pleaſing, delight us the more, becauſe we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately forc'd to leave them for the perfection of ſome different Harmony. Nor is the Eye leſs ſatisfied than the Ear, For an Admirable Poet always Paints. and all his Pictures are always Beautiful: Let the real objects be never ſo odious, let them be never ſo dreadful, yet he is ſure to paint them Delightful. For, tho ſometimes a vigorous lively Imitation of Creatures that are in their natures noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, may be capable of giving us Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, yet Nature, by giving us a ſecret Intelligence that the object is not real, can turn even that Tormenting Paſſion to pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Thus Poetry, by reſtoring the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Human Faculties, provides for the Happineſs of Mankind, better than any other Human Invention what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And 'tis for this reaſon that it has always been ſo highly eſteem'd by the greateſt of men. They who have arriv'd at the being Maſters of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, have afterwards entertain'd the Ambition of becoming Poets; and after they have acquir'd a great deal of Fame by making whole Nations miſerable,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0391600400:202"/>
have aſpir'd to the more charming glory of making mankind happy. 'Tis for this very reaſon, that this Delicious Art has had as many Confeſſors, if I may be allow'd to call them ſo, almoſt as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf. 'Tis for this very reaſon, that ſo many have been willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all worldly greatneſs for it, and pleaſure which attends on power, and have been contented to live poor and miſerable, pitied by the wiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd by fools, perſecuted by fortune, and hated by one another.</p>
                  <p>For, no man leaves pleaſure but for greater pleaſure, and he who forſakes all the world for Poetry, muſt find a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in that, which all the world could not ſupply him with. Poetry ſeems to be a noble attempt of Nature, by which it endeavours to exalt it ſelf to its happy primitive ſtate; and he who is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with an accompliſh'd Poem, is for a time at leaſt reſtor'd to Paradice. That happy man converſes boldly with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Beings. Tranſported he beholds the Gods aſcending and deſcending, and every Paſſion in its turn is charm'd, while that his Reaſon is ſupreamly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Perpetual Harmony attends his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0391600400:203"/>
Ear, his Eye perpetual Pleaſure. Ten thouſand different objects he ſurveys, and the moſt dreadful pleaſe him. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Lyons he beholds like the firſt Man with joy, becauſe like him he ſees them without danger. But nothing that is meerly Human can be on all ſides per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The Delight which Poetry gives is neither perpetual, nor are all men ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it. Religion alone can provide man a pleaſure that is laſting, as it may be univerſal. Poetical fire neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways burns in us, nor can it always warm us, but Charity, like the ſacred flame that was the guardian of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, if 'tis with care maintain'd like that, becomes like that eternal.</p>
                  <p>But now ſince the deſign of Poetry, and the very method of proſecuting that deſign, as far as it can be humanly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, is the ſame with that of the True Religion, ſince the very thing that they both propoſe is to exalt the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by exalting the Paſſions, and ſo make Happy the whole Man by making Internal Diſcord ceaſe, I appeal to any one whether Poetry muſt not agree bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with that Religion, whoſe Deſigns are the very ſame with it, than with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0391600400:204"/>
or Philoſophy or Deiſm, whoſe Deſigns have been ſhewn repugnant to it. In ſhort, when the Pagan Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy was brought nearer to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, by the Philoſophy of <hi>Plato</hi>; as it was modelled by <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> it became the fitter for Poetry. For <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaw with an admirable judgment, not only that the Reaſon muſt find its account in Poetry, as well as the Paſſions and the Sences, but that the Reaſon of Mankind, in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> when Moral Philoſophy got ground every day in the World, would not be ſatisfied at ſo eaſy a rate, as it was when <hi>Homer</hi> writ; or at leaſt that it would not long be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at ſo eaſy a rate; which oblig'd him to model the <hi>Grecian</hi> Revelation by the Philoſophy of <hi>Plato,</hi> and that got <hi>Virgil</hi> the preheminence over <hi>Homer.</hi> For ſince the deſign of every Art is to make men happy, and that is the beſt and the nobleſt Art which makes the beſt proviſion for the happineſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and nothing can make man ſo happy as the reconciling him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which can be no way ſo effectually done, as by making all the Faculties find
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0391600400:205"/>
their ſatisfaction together, it follows that that muſt be the nobleſt Poetry, where the Reaſon, the Paſſions and Sences, are all of them pleas'd, and pleas'd in the higheſt degree together. And therefore tho we ſhould be obliged to grant what ſome will pretend with ſo much obſtinacy, and which I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe, that the Paſſions and the Sences find their account in <hi>Homer</hi> better than they do in <hi>Virgil,</hi> yet ſince they find their account too in <hi>Virgil,</hi> in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great degree, and Reaſon at the ſame time is ſatisfied, whereas it is horribly ſhock'd in <hi>Homer</hi> by the extravagance of his Theology, it follows that <hi>Virgil</hi> for that Reaſon is certainly to be preferred to <hi>Homer</hi>; tho this is to be ſaid in the behalf of the latter, that he writ to the people of his own age, in which the Reaſon of Mankind was ſatisfy'd at an eaſier rate.</p>
                  <p>And therefore when I ſay that <hi>Virgil</hi> is to be preferr'd to <hi>Homer,</hi> I mean that he is ſo in regard to us, becauſe he is capable of giving us a greater pleaſure than <hi>Homer,</hi> but I do not pretend at the ſame time that <hi>Virgil</hi> is capable of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us a greater pleaſure than <hi>Homer</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0391600400:206"/>
gave his Contemporaries. As likewiſe when I affirm, that the Moderns, by joyning Poetry with the True Religion, will have the Advantage of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, I mean only in regard to us, to whom they will give a greater pleaſure than the Ancients can do, but not a greater than the Ancients gave their Contemporaries. In ſhort, if <hi>Virgil</hi> was forc'd to model his <hi>Grecian</hi> Revelation by <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> that he might pleaſe more effectually even in his time, when that Revelation as yet prevail'd; I think we may very well conclude that in our time we ought to fling it out of our Poetry, when it has been for ſo long time utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exploded, and contemn'd by the very Boys. Thus the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion and the Modern Poetry can agree but very indifferently, becauſe the Reaſon is ſhock'd by it. And if Reaſon is ſhock'd by the Religion which is joyn'd with the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; by the Religion, I ſay, which gives the force to the Paſſions, as we have ſhewn above; I would fain know how the Paſſions can very well find their account. I know indeed very well, that a Poet, by the force of a ſtrong Imagination, may enter into the <hi>Grecian</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0391600400:207"/>
Religion when he ſets himſelf to write, and tranſport himſelf to the Age and Scene of his Action; and conſequently may draw a great deal of advantage from the Religion of that Country, and of that Age, in order to the being mov'd; and if the Poet is extremely mov'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, why they who read him muſt be mov'd in ſome meaſure too; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the generality of Readers can be ſo very much mov'd, as if the Paſſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd their Force from a Religion that is more familiar to them, I have a great deal of reaſon to doubt: But if Reaſon cannot find its account in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion joyn'd with the Modern Poetry, much leſs would the Paſſions find their ſatisfaction in Deiſm or the Ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. The Chriſtian Religion alone can ſupply a Poet with all that is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and Majeſtick in Reaſon; all that is either ſoft or powerful, either enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or Imperious in the Paſſions; and with all the objects that are moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the ſences, and conſequently moſt delightful; as ſhall be ſhewn at large in the following Chapter.</p>

                  <p>WE ſhew'd in the former part of this Treatiſe that the Ancients excell'd the Moderns in the greatneſs of Poetry, becauſe they incorporated Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with Religion; and we pretended to ſhew in this Second Part, That by joyning Poetry with the true Religion, the Moderns in the main will have the advantage of the Ancients. In order to the proving which, we ſhew'd in the firſt Chapter, that the deſign of the Chriſtian Religion was agreeable to that of Poetry; whereas the Deſigns of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm and Deiſm and Philoſophy were not agreeable to it. We ſhew'd that the true Deſign of Poetry, as well as of the Chriſtian Religion, was to pleaſe the Reaſon, the Paſſions and the Sences at the ſame time. For we ſhew'd in the former part of this Treatiſe, that Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether ordinary or Enthuſiaſtick, is the principal thing in Poetry; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more certain than that the more
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0391600400:209"/>
the Sences are ſtirr'd, and the more the Reaſon at the ſame time is ſatisfied, the more ſtrongly for the moſt part the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reaſonable creatures are mov'd.</p>
                  <p>Now in this Chapter we pretend to ſhew, that the true Divine Poetry has the advantage of the Pagan Poetry; that it ſatisfies the Reaſon more, at the ſame time that it raiſes a ſtronger Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that it entertains the Sences, and eſpecially the Eye, more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and we pretend to give undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtances of it, both from Sacred Writ, and from one of the Fathers, and from one of our own Poets.</p>
                  <p>There is certainly to ſubject ſo great as the power of God, and both <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have handled it to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The latter ſays of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who preſided at the Council of the Gods, in the Tenth Book.</p>

But to ſhow the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity of ſuch an objection, I deſire any one to produce any thing from the<hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, upon the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that is any ways comparable to this paſſage of the Pſalmiſt. For, as our Religion gives us more exalted notions of the power of an Infinite Being, than the Heathen Religion did to the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Poets; it conſequently produces a ſtronger ſpirit in Poetry, when it is manag'd by thoſe who have Souls that are capable of expreſſing it.</p>

                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0391600400:223"/>
I could produce a hundred paſſages more out of Sacred Writ, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſuperiour to any thing that can be brought upon the ſame ſubject from the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Poets.</p>
                  <p>And the only reaſon why I refuſe to do it, is becauſe it may be pretended, that the Writers in Sacred Writ had the peculiar advantage of Divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that no conſequence can be drawn from them in the behalf of the Moderns, who pretend not to the ſame advantage. And therefore I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome inſtances of the preheminence of the Chriſtian over the Pagan Poets; whoſe Authors cannot be pretended to have been Divinely aſſiſted, in a more peculiar manner, than any of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns may be. The firſt inſtance that I ſhall bring, ſhall be from the Hymn of St <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> a Father of the Church, who lived in the third Century; a Hymn more exalted than either <hi>Orphens</hi> or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> or <hi>Callimachus</hi> ever produced. I have given the former part of it a dreſs of my own; thro the which, tho perhaps it may appear diſguis'd to the Reader, yet even thro that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, he may diſcern a Greatneſs, and a

                  <p>The next Inſtance is from <hi>Milton,</hi> who in the ſeventh Book of the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice loſt,</hi> has handled the ſubject of the Creation better than either <hi>Ovid</hi> or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> himſelf has done. Tho he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly above <hi>Ovid</hi> by the force of his own genius, as much as by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Religion; but 'tis by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only that he excels <hi>Virgil,</hi> than
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0391600400:233"/>
whom I do not believe that any man can have a greater Genius. When I ſay that <hi>Milton</hi> excels <hi>Virgil,</hi> I mean that he does ſo ſometimes both in his Thought and in his Spirit, purely by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Religion. But at the ſame time I am very far from thinking that he ſo much as equals him either in the continual harmony of his Verſification; or the conſtant of Beauty of his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or his perpetual exaltation. He writ in a Language that was not capable of ſo much Beauty, or ſo much Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and his Inequality proceeded from his want of Art to manage his ſubject, and make it conſtanly great. For it would be an eaſie matter to prove that none of the Moderns underſtood the Art of Heroick Poetry, who writ before <hi>Boſſu</hi> took pains to unravel the Myſtery. But nothing can make more for my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than to ſhow that <hi>Milton,</hi> who lay under theſe vaſt diſadvantages, very oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en excell'd, even the Prince of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, both in the greatneſs of of his Thought and his Spirit.</p>

                  <p>What a number of admirable Images are here crowding upon one another? So natural and peculiar to the ſubject, that they would have been as abſurd and extravagant in any other, as they are wonderfully juſt in this. And yet even in this ſubject nothing could have ſupply'd a Poet with them, but ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine a Religion. So that at the ſame time that the eye is raviſhingly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, Admiration is rais'd to a height, and the Reaſon is ſupremely ſatisfied. For are not theſe effects that are worthy of an infinite Cauſe? Can any thing be more ſurprizingly ſtrong than this ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getick Image?</p>

                  <p>I thought to have proceeded, and to have compar'd the Councils and Fights of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi>; and above all, their Deſcription of Hell and its Torments; in which both thoſe great Poets ſeem to have exerted all their ſtrength. But I am afraid I have already run into length, and there is matter remaining for an entire volume.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have endeavour'd to ſhow in the former part of this Book, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reaſon why the Ancient Poets excell'd the Moderns in the greatneſs of Poetry, was becauſe they incorporated Poetry with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and in the Second Part, That the Moderns, by joyning the Chriſtian Religion with Poetry will have the advantage of the Ancients; that is, that they will have the aſſiſtance of a Religion that is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the deſign of Poetry than the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion.</p>
