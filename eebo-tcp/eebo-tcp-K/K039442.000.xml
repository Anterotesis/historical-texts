            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PErmit me to hope that you will pardon the honeſt ambition which has encourag'd me to ſeek a proper Patroneſs for <hi>Marina</hi> in your Ladyſhip; whoſe real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter gives countenance to the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary one, and whoſe conſtant practice is a living example of that ſteady vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and exalted piety, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the old Play from whence this is taken, has happily deſcribed in his <hi>Princeſs of Tyre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſcious of no mean views, and ſecur'd by the univerſal acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0054300500:3"/>
of your merit from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of flattery, I approach your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though a ſtranger, and without any previous application, with the leſs diffidence: If this Play ſhould appear on peruſal to be deſigned to promote ſomething better than meer amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that will effectually recommend it to the favour of the Counteſs of <hi>Hertford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To place merit in the gifts of fortune, and happineſs in what an hour may, and a few years certainly will bring to an end, is the folly and miſery of too many who are reputed wiſe and great. To be truly ſo is with your Ladyſhip to regard the fineſt underſtanding, the moſt fruitful invention, the happieſt elocution, talents far ſuperior to wealth and dignity, but as they ſubſerve the intereſt of truth and virtue, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the poſſeſſors of them, in the midſt of affluence, moderate even in the uſe of lawful pleaſures, humble in the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0054300500:4"/>
moſt exalted ſtations, and capable of living above the world, even in the poſſeſſion of all it can beſtow. I am afraid and unwilling to offend. But as univerſal benevolence is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of virtue, your Ladyſhip muſt ſuffer your own to be ſpoken of, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever painful it may be to you, that others may not want a pattern for their encouragement or reprehenſion, as they ſhall improve or neglect it. A truly great mind diſcovers it ſelf by nothing more than by a benign and well plac'd condeſcenſion; of which your Ladyſhip's known eſteem for the late excellent Mrs. <hi>Rowe,</hi> is a noble inſtance, and an undoubted proof, amongſt many others which you daily give, of the goodneſs of your heart and underſtanding, and cannot be mentioned but to your honour.</p>
            <p>I can affirm, and I hope I ſhall be thought ſincere, that what I have ſaid doth not proceed from cuſtom as a
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0054300500:5"/>
Dedicator, but from a mind fully convinc'd of its truth in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and a heart touch'd with a character ſo very amiable.</p>
            <p>That you may long live an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a ſupport of thoſe excellent principles which you profeſs and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and that your influence and example may do all the good that you your ſelf can wiſh, is the earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of,</p>

                  <l>There's endleſs ſpace, and as repleat with love</l>
                  <l>As the great deep with waters. Wou'd our voices</l>

               <l>WHEN to a future race the preſent days</l>
               <l>Shall be the theme of cenſure or of praiſe,</l>
               <l>When they ſhall blame what's wrong, what's right allow,</l>
               <l>Juſt as you treat your own fore-fathers now,</l>
               <l>I'm thinking what a figure you will make,</l>
               <l>No light concern, Sirs, where your fame's at ſtake.</l>
               <l>I hope we need not urge your country's cauſe,</l>
               <l>You'll guard her glory, and aſſert her laws,</l>
               <l>Nor force your ruin'd race, mad with their pains,</l>
               <l>To curſe you as the authors of their chains,</l>
               <l>We dare not think, we wou'd not fear, you will;</l>
               <l>For <hi>Britons</hi> though provok'd, are <hi>Britons</hi> ſtill.</l>
               <l>Yet let not this kind caution give offence:</l>
               <l>The ſureſt friend to liberty is ſenſe,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0054300500:59"/>How that declines the drooping arts declare;</l>
               <l>Are your diverſions what your fathers were?</l>
               <l>At maſquerades, your wiſdom to diſplay,</l>
               <l>You make the ſtupid farce for which you pay.</l>
               <l>Muſick it ſelf may be too dearly bought,</l>
               <l>Nor was it ſure deſign'd to baniſh thought.</l>
               <l>But, Sirs, what e'er's your fate in future ſtory,</l>
               <l>Well have the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fair ſecured their glory.</l>
               <l>When worſe than barbariſm had ſunk your taſte,</l>
               <l>When nothing pleas'd but what laid virtue waſte,</l>
               <l>A ſacred band, determin'd, wiſe, and good,</l>
               <l>They jointly roſe to ſtop th' exotick flood,</l>
               <l>And ſtrove to wake, by <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s nervous lays,</l>
               <l>The manly genius of <hi>Eliza</hi>'s days.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Be it an omen of returning ſenſe,</l>
               <l>Others adopt our ſoftneſs and expence:</l>
               <l>Well pleas'd ſuch harmleſs inſults we may bear,</l>
